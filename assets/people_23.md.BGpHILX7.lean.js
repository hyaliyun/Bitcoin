It was established to provide trained and disciplined drivers for the Royal Artillery, a service that had previously relied upon civilian contractors. Though closely associated with the Royal Regiment of Artillery the corps was listed separately from it in the London Gazette until at least 1815. By 1814 the corps numbered more than 7,400 men and fielded more than 2,600 men at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo. The unit was reduced in size after the end of the Napoleonic Wars and disbanded in 1822 by the Duke of Wellington.  Foundation and service  What later became the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers was founded in 1793 by Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond who, as Master-General of the Ordnance, had responsibility for the British Army's artillery, engineers and logistics. Prior to this time the artillery guns, ammunition and other supplies had been transported by civilian contractors. These contractors supplied the necessary men, wagons and horses, but there were sometimes problems when these men some untrained abandoned their task in battle. The men of the new corps were uniformed army personnel trained in managing guns, wagons and horses. The use of the corps allowed for quicker movement of the artillery; and, as provision was made for the gunners to travel on the gun limbers and wagons, reduced time for the guns to be brought into action. As first constituted, the corps consisted of 45 officers, 1,330 other ranks and 2,380 horses. By 1810 the corps had 78 officers, 4,860 other ranks and 7,000 horses; sufficient for the needs of the entire British field artillery. By 1814 the corps had grown to 88 officers and 7,352 other ranks; at the 1815 Battle of Waterloo more than half of the 5,300 artillery men present were from the corps of drivers. The corps had its headquarters within the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich. Disbandment Following the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars seven troops of the corps were disbanded, leaving it with five troops and 1,336 men ‚Äì a measure that saved ¬£14,570 per annum. The officers of the corps were retired and replaced by officers made available from the Horse Artillery, which had lost three troops. This provided a means for the Board of Ordnance to retain experienced gunnery officers. The officers made redundant from the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers were granted retirement on full pay (half-pay was the usual allowance for retired officers) due to the unusual circumstances; this cost the board some ¬£1,600 per year in pensions. The corps was disbanded in 1822 by the Duke of Wellington, who was then Master-General of the Ordnance. The Royal Artillery thereafter took responsibility for its own transport, with the artillerymen in the field batteries functioning as drivers and gunners. Major-General Sir Alex Dixon stated in 1838 that the system provided for better economic and efficient use of men, with 5,000 artillerymen able to do the work previously carried out by the 7,000-strong Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers. Dixon stated that the corps had unnecessarily tied up several thousand men in logistics duty during the Peninsular War. The new system, which was to be maintained even in times of war, was said to be particularly suited to the British Army, which needed units to be made ready at short notice for foreign or colonial service.  Structure and organisation  A depiction of the uniform of a sergeant of the corps in 1812 As initially constituted, the corps was formed of several independent Companies, each under the command of a Captain Commissary, who was individually empowered to buy and sell the horses required for his Company to operate. This, however, led to mismanagement, with officers deriving 'considerable emoluments from the situation, by the sale of the dung'. As a result, 'an Officer of Artillery was appointed to take command of the whole': Lt-Col. (later Lt-Gen.) Robert Douglas, who served as Commandant from 1795 through until 1817. =Name of the corps= The corps was governed by a series of warrants, being formally established by George III on 9 September 1794 as the \\"Corps of Captain Commissaries and Drivers attached to the parks of Artillery, serving in England\\". (A separate warrant of the same date approved the raising of a corps of commissary officers, non-commissioned officers and drivers to serve with the artillery 'now employed in the Low Countries'.) By a warrant of 1801 the corps was expanded and reconstituted as the \\"Corps of Gunner Drivers\\"; but another warrant of 1804 redesignated the establishment as the \\"Brigade of Gunners and Drivers, employed with the field trains, in our Royal Regiment of Artillery\\". By a further warrant of 1806, it was formally titled the \\"Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers, employed with the field trains in our Royal Regiment of Artillery\\". (The Field Train Department was responsible for the provision and distribution of guns, ammunition and stores to the Artillery on active service, and maintained 150 guns and 30 howitzers 'in a perfect state of readiness for any service' at its headquarters in the Grand Dep√¥t, Woolwich; it therefore had to have a close working relationship with the corps, which provided, in a similar state of readiness, the horses and drivers to move them.) After 1817 the corps was listed as the \\"Corps of Artillery Drivers in the Royal Regiment of Artillery\\". =Ranks= The corps' officers had ranks similar to those of the rest of the British Army. Being closely associated with the artillery they followed their practice of using the ranks of first and second lieutenant. Until 1810 all officer ranks were suffixed with \\"commissary\\" (eg \\"first lieutenant-commissary\\" or \\"captain- commissary\\") but this was dropped the following year. The uniform was similar to that of the Horse Artillery, particularly with regards to the wearing of the light dragoon-style Tarleton helmet. Officers of the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers had no right of field command, all line officers outranked them and could issue commands to higher ranking corps officers on the battlefield. There was some controversy during the Napoleonic Wars as to whether officers in the corps should be allowed to freely transfer into the line infantry. It was commonplace, for example, for officers of the Royal Waggon Train to be promoted into line infantry regiments once they had accumulated sufficient years of service in their rank. A notable exception was a first lieutenant-commissary of the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers who was granted special permission to become adjutant of the Ceylon Regiment in 1810. Unusually, and 'contrary to every military principle', the privates of the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers were not provided with any offensive or defensive weapon. =Establishment= The corps (as envisaged in its 1806 Warrant) was divided into ten Troops, each under the command of a captain, with 5 lieutenants and 450 drivers in each Troop; there was also a Riding House Troop (without drivers). Within a Troop, each lieutenant was responsible for one 'Brigade' of artillery (five guns and one howitzer), along with six ammunition carriages, a forge cart, spares and a camp equipage waggon; the number of horses and drivers used depended on the size of the guns. By 1810 the corps comprised a colonel-commandant, three lieutenant-colonels, a major, nine captains, 54 subalterns, 2 adjutants, 8 veterinary surgeons, 45 staff sergeants, 405 other non-commissioned officers, 360 artificers, 45 trumpeters, 4,050 drivers and 7,000 horses. The sole major of the corps was in charge of the purchase of horses. Until 1817 the corps included on its strength all veterinary surgeons in the service of the Royal Artillery; after 1817 they were instead attached to the Veterinary Establishment in Woolwich. =Duties= In addition to their guns, the drivers and horses of the corps conveyed ammunition and stores for the Field Artillery units. They were furthermore responsible for conveying ammunition to the 'troops, volunteers &c.;' of the Army more generally 'all over the kingdom'. As a cheaper alternative to using contract horses, horses belonging to the corps were often used by the Royal Engineers, as well as for station 'fatigue duties' such as conveying coal and forage. The establishment of the Corps of Royal Artillery Drivers included a riding house troop, for training riders in equestrianism.

She is the director of the Center of Global Women's Health Technologies (GWHT) and founder of Zenalux Biomedical Inc. and Calla Health Ramanujam has spent the last two decades developing precision diagnostics and more recently precision therapeutics for breast and cervical cancer, with a focus on addressing global health disparities. She has more than 20 patents and over 150 publications for screening, diagnostic, and surgical applications, and has raised over $30M of funding to pursue these innovations through a variety of funding mechanisms, including NIH R01s and R21s, NIH Bioengineering Partnerships, NCI Academic Industry Partnerships, NIH Small Business grants and USAID funding. As the founding director of the Center for Global Women's Health Technologies at Duke University, she has developed a consortium of over 50+ partners including international academic institutions and hospitals, non-governmental organizations, ministries of health, and commercial partners; this consortium is working to ensure that the technologies developed at the center are adopted by cancer control programs in geographically and economically diverse healthcare settings.  Research and career  Ramanujam's research on women's cancers has centered on translational and laboratory research of relevance to breast and cervical cancer. While her guiding principles are similar across breast and cervical cancer, the technical challenges needed to tackle these cancers are inherently different. In the case of cervical cancer prevention, her focus is to develop strategies that reduce attrition to treatment including early screening and diagnostics. In the breast cancer care cascade, clinical care has principally pivoted towards a focus on how to inform the effectiveness of cancer therapy whether it is surgery or systemic therapy, and that is where she has focused her efforts via molecular and metabolic imaging. A third area in her research program focuses on low cost ablative strategies for local control of cancer in resource limited settings. She has also created two companies Zenalux and Calla Health to commercialize her breast and cervical imaging products, respectively. Additionally, she has created three social innovations programs, WISH to impact cervical cancer prevention in low resource settings, IGNITE to scale social innovation education to students globally and the Calla Campaign to bridge inequities in sexual and reproductive health inequities through story-telling and art. She has received recognition for her work through the TR100 Young Innovator Award from MIT, the Global Indus Technovator award from MIT, Era of Hope Scholar awards from the DOD, the Stasnell Family award from the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke, the Emerging Leader in Global Health Award from the Consortium of Universities in Global Health, the Social Impact Abie Award from AnitaB.org, the Biophotonics Technology Innovator Award from the International Society for Optics and Photonics, and the Women in Molecular Imaging Leadership Award (WIMIN) from the World Molecular Imaging Congress (WMIC).

The CSDP involves military or civilian missions being deployed to preserve peace, prevent conflict and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Military missions are carried out by EU forces established with contributions from the member states' armed forces. The CSDP also entails collective self-defence amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. The CSDP structure, headed by the Union's High Representative (HR/VP), Federica Mogherini, comprises: *the Defence Industry Directorate-General of the European Commission *relevant sections of the External Action Service (EEAS) ‚Äî including the Military Staff (EUMS) with its so-called Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) *a number of Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) preparatory bodies ‚Äî such as the Military Committee (EUMC) *four agencies, including the Defence Agency (EDA) The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU's CSDP missions. The MPCC, established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU's first step in developing a permanent military headquarters. In parallel, the newly established European Defence Fund (EDF) marks the first time the EU budget is used to finance multinational defence projects. The CSDP structure is sometimes referred to as the European Defence Union (EDU), especially in relation to its prospective development as the EU's defence arm.http://eppgroup.eu/document/119334 Decisions relating to the CSDP are proposed by the HR/VP, adopted by the FAC, generally requiring unanimity, and then implemented by the HR/VP. Deployment procedure Military operations may be launched after four planning phases, through which the Operation Commander (Op. Cdr.), Military Staff (EUMS), Military Committee (EUMC), Political and Security Committee (PSC) and Council have different roles: :I: Political Framework for Crisis Approach (PFCA) :II: Crisis Management Concept (CMC) :III: Military Strategic Options (MSO, unless within CMC) and Initiating Military Directive (IMD) :IV: Concept of Operations (CONOPS), Operations Plan (OPLAN) and Rules of Engagement (ROE) Overview All military or civilian missions of the European Union (EU), as part of its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), are planned and conducted by an operation headquarters (OHQ). All civilian missions are directed by the Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC), a directorate of the External Action Service (EEAS) in Brussels, Belgium. For each military mission an OHQ is chosen. The EU does not have a permanent military command structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU's CSDP missions. The Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC), established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU's first step in developing a permanent operational headquarters (OHQ). Bodies and political leadership =High Representative= High Representative Federica Mogherini The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, commonly referred to as the High Representative (HR/VP), is the chief co-ordinator and representative of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), including the CSDP. The position is currently held by Federica Mogherini. Where foreign matters is agreed between EU member states, the High Representative can speak for the EU in that area, such as negotiating on behalf of the member states. Beside representing the EU at international fora and co-ordinating the CFSP and the CSDP, the HR/VP is: * ex-officio Vice- President of the European Commission * participant in the meetings of the European Council * responsible of the European Union Special Representatives * head of the External Action Service and the delegations * President of the Foreign Affairs Council * Head of the European Defence Agency * Chairperson of the board of the European Union Institute for Security Studies =European Commission= * Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space, established in 2019 =External Action Service= Military Staff Director General Pulkkinen The European External Action Service (EEAS) is the diplomatic service and foreign and defence ministry of the EU. The EEAS is led by the HR/VP and seated in Brussels. The EEAS does not propose or implement policy in its own name, but prepares acts to be adopted by the HR/VP, the European Commission or the Council. The EEAS is also in charge of EU diplomatic missions (delegations)Art. 5 of COUNCIL DECISION establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service PDF, Council of the European Union, 20 July 2010 and intelligence and crisis management structures. The following EEAS bodies take part in managing the CSDP: *The Military Staff (EUMS) is an EEAS Directorate-General that provides strategic advice to the HR/VP and commands military operations through its Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC) operational headquarters. The EUMS also reports to the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), representing member states' Chiefs of Defence, and performs \\"early warning\\", situation assessment and strategic planning. The EUMS currently consists of 200+ military and civilian personnel. The EUMS and the European Defence Agency (EDA) together form the Secretariat of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the structural integration pursued by 25 of the 28 national armed forces of the EU since 2017. *The Intelligence and Situation Centre (EU INTCEN) *The Security and Defence College (ESDC) is a virtual institution for strategic level training. The ESDC consists of a network of various national institutions, such as defence colleges, and the European Union Institute for Security Studies.SCADPlus: European Security and Defence College (ESDC) , Retrieved on 4 March 2008 The ESDC initiated the European initiative for the exchange of young officers inspired by Erasmus, often referred to as military Erasmus, exchanging between armed forces of future military officers as well as their teachers and instructors during their initial education and training. Due to the fact that the initiative is implemented by the Member States on a purely voluntary basis, their autonomy with regard to military training is not compromised. *The Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) *The Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC) *The Joint Support Coordination Cell (JSCC) =Council= Graziano has served as Chairman of the Military Committee since 2018 The Council of the European Union has the following, Brussels-based preparatory bodies in the field of CSDP: *The Political and Security Committee (PSC) consists of ambassadorial level representatives from the EU member states and usually meets twice per week.France-Diplomatie: The main bodies specific to the CFSP: The Political and Security Committee, accessed on 21 April 2008 The PSC is chaired by the External Action Service.

It is also a forum for dialogue on CSDP matters between the EU Member States. PSC also drafts opinions for the Foreign Affairs Council, which is one of the configurations of the Council of the European Union. CFSP matters are passed to the Foreign Affairs Council via COREPER II. *The European Union Military Committee (EUMC) is composed of member states' Chiefs of Defence (CHOD). These national CHODs are regularly represented in the EUMC in Brussels by their permanent Military Representatives (MilRep), who often are two- or three-star flag officers. The EUMC is under the under authority of the EU's High Representative (HR) and the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The EUMC gives military advice to the EU's High Representative (HR) and Political and Security Committee (PSC). The EUMC also oversees the European Union Military Staff (EUMS). *The Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management (CIVCOM) is an advisory body dealing with civilian aspects of crisis management. The activities of CIVCOM therefore forms part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of EU, and the civilian side of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). CIVCOM is composed of representatives of the EU member states. The activities of CIVCOM for civilian CSDP tasks occur in parallel to the European Union Military Committee (EUMC) for military CDP tasks. Both EUMC and CIVCOM receive directions from, and report to the Political and Security Committee (PSC). The decision to establish CIVCOM was taken in 2000 by the Council of the European Union. *The Politico-Military Group (PMG) carries out preparatory work for the Political and Security Committee (PSC). It covers the political aspects of EU military and civil- military issues, including concepts, capabilities and operations and missions. The tasks of the PMG include: 1) preparing Council conclusions and provides recommendations for the PSC, and monitoring their effective implementation 2) contributing to the development of horizontal policy and facilitating information exchanges. The PMG has a particular responsibility regarding partnerships with non-EU countries and other organisations, including EU-NATO relations, as well as exercises. The PMG is chaired by a representative of the HR/VP. =Agencies= The following agencies relate to the CSDP: *The Defence Agency (EDA), based in Brussels, facilitates the improvement of national military capabilities and integration. In that capacity, it makes proposals, coordinates, stimulates collaboration, and runs projects. *The Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), based in Warsaw, Poland, leads the European coast guard that controls the borders of the Schengen Area. *The Institute for Security Studies (ISS), based in Paris, is an autonomous think tank that researches EU-relevant security issues. The research results are published in papers, books, reports, policy briefs, analyses and newsletters. In addition, the institute convenes seminars and conferences on relevant issues that bring together EU officials, national experts, decision-makers and NGO representatives from all Member States. *The Satellite Centre (SatCen), located in Torrej√≥n de Ardoz, Spain, supports the decision-making by providing products and services resulting from the exploitation of relevant space assets and collateral data, including satellite and aerial imagery, and related services. Permanent structured cooperation The Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) is the framework in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. Based on Article 42.6 and Protocol 10 of the Treaty on European Union, introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, PESCO was first initiated in 2017.Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) - Factsheet, European External Action Service The initial integration within the PESCO format is a number of projects planned to launch in 2018.http://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/32079/pesco-overview-of-first- collaborative-of-projects-for-press.pdf PESCO is similar to enhanced co- operation in other policy areas, in the sense that integration does not require that all EU member states participate. Funding of missions Defence industry coordination and research funding The European Defence Fund is an EU-managed fund for coordinating and increasing national investment in defence research and improve interoperability between national forces. It was proposed in 2016 by President Jean-Claude Juncker and established in 2017 to a value of ‚Ç¨5.5 billion per year. The fund has two stands; research (‚Ç¨90 million until the end of 2019 and ‚Ç¨500 million per year after 2020) and development & acquisition (‚Ç¨500 million in total for 2019‚Äì20 then ‚Ç¨1 billion per year after 2020).

Description Completely contained in the Alajuela province, this is as of 2019 an almost straight road between San Carlos and Los Chiles, this road together with Route 4 and Route 32 allows the access between the Caribbean side of the country to the northern Alajuela districts and Nicaragua. Since 2005 a new segment is under construction to expand the road to Route 1 towards San Jose, the project is known as the (North Internal Axis). In Alajuela province the route covers San Carlos canton (Florencia, Cutris, Pocosol districts), Los Chiles canton (Los Chiles, El Amparo, San Jorge districts). =National Route 768= National Tertiary Route 768 was a 6km road created to link the north end of Route 35 at Los Chiles to Nicaragua National Route 25B. It is now part of Route 35. Allows international access to Nicaragua using the migration checkpoint of Las Tablillas. History =New road to San Carlos= A new road between Route 1 and San Carlos, using the current Route 35 has been in construction since 2005, approved by the Legislative Assembly in December 1969, the initial plans are from the first half of the 1970s, with designs from 1989. The project was split into three subprojects, with a projected finish date of around 2025, after more than fifty years of the project ratification. North end (Abundancia to Florencia) Finished in September 2018, this segment connects in a more straightforward way the towns of Ciudad Quesada and Florencia. The segment has a length of 5.6km whereas the previous journey was of 8.1km using Route 141 through a windy narrow road and several small towns. A new junction with a ground level roundabout and a lower level direct road was constructed. Central segment (Sif√≥n to Abundancia) Of around 30km, construction started in 2005, however it was stalled due to several geological, environmental and financial issues, including: * The wetland, wasn't taken into account, and the route would go across it. * Seventy three geological faults not documented and found until while in construction. * The already constructed bridge over Laguna river will be demolished due to a geological fault, a new path was designed. In August 2018 the government then suspended the contract with the S√°nchez-Carvajal construction company. As of 2019 there is an estimated 60% completion of this segment, however steel materials have been stolen due to the abandoned state of the project. This project is now further split: * Between La Abundancia and Alto Sucre junction, and a new tertiary route of 8km. Estimated end date of 2021. * Between Sucre and Sif√≥n, of 23km, making use of the constructed and abandoned two lane bridges over the rivers of Barranca, Tapezco, Arenas, Seco, San Crist√≥bal and Ron Ron. The bridges of Espino and La Vieja rivers will be newly constructed with four lanes. * Further widening of the mentioned bridges to four lanes, between 2022 and 2025. South end (San Miguel de Naranjo, or San Ram√≥n, to Sif√≥n) In the planning and design stage as of September 2019, construction will have a planned start date of January 2022 and finish date of March 2024.

The society, which first met on February 3, 1989 at Harvey's Chelsea Restaurant in New York City, is organized into chapters called \\"Lairs.\\" Lairs have been organized in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Roanoke, Virginia, and Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Lairs officers include: Director, Assistant Director, Secretary, Treasurer, Keeper of the Humidor, and Archivist. Coordinating the work of the RR&R; at a national level and acting as the society's Board of Trustees is the Ephorate, a council comprising three Ephors, a constitutional office found in ancient Sparta. Members are organized into four ranks: Postulates, Rascals, Rogues, and Rapscallions. A man joins the society at the rank of Postulate. Upon completing in one ‚ÄúMass Challenge‚Äù and one ‚ÄúResearch Report‚Äù within two years, the Postulate is elevated to Rascal and receives from the Lair his \\"Rascal Challenge,\\" a specific research topic on which he is challenged to discover interesting and important results. Upon his presentation of his \\"Rascal Challenge\\" report at a regular meeting of the Lair, the Rascal is elevated to Rogue and receives a \\"Rogue Challenge\\" from the Order of Rapscallions.

For example, the 2003 Mass Challenge in the Doylestown Lair was to invent a patentable device. The winner of that competition, Dr. Michael Moscherosch, invented a device that keeps cigars lit when their owners are not puffing on them. That \\"device to avoid auto-extinguishing of cigars\\" was later awarded patent no. 7387129 by the US Patent Office, a patent assigned to the RR&R.;US Patent  https://patents.justia.com/assignee/rascals-rogues-and-rapscallionsGoogle Patents  https://patents.google.com/patent/US7387129B2/en In the fourth case, the Research Reports, all members of the group make brief, informal presentations on their current research interests.

Cigars Cigars are a regular part of all RR&R; meetings. In the early days of the society, public restaurants had rooms set aside for parties that wished to smoke. Since that time, however, increasingly restrictive legislation has driven the RR&R; from public restaurants to private clubs, such as the Moose Lodge or the Maennerchor Society, where smoking is permitted. Each Lair elects a Keeper of the Humidor who provides unusual cigars at each meeting. Each meeting closes with a singing of \\"My Last Cigar,\\" a sentimental ballad popular in the late 19th century.

Early life Francis was born in the Province of Pennsylvania, then a part of British America, on August 30, 1767 and named after his uncle. He was a son of Tench Francis Jr. (1730‚Äì1800) and Anne (n√©e Willing) Francis (1733‚Äì1812). Among his siblings was older brother John Francis, who married a daughter of John Brown and was the father of John Brown Francis, a U.S. Senator and Governor of Rhode Island. For many years, his father was agent for the William Penn family in connection with their proprietary interests in provincial Pennsylvania, and served as the first cashier of the Bank of North America. His paternal grandparents were Elizabeth (n√©e Turbutt) Francis and Tench Francis Sr., the Attorney General of the Province of Pennsylvania. Among his extended family was uncle Turbutt Francis and aunt, Margaret Francis (wife of Chief Justice Edward Shippen IV). Among his first cousins were Tench Tilghman (an aide to George Washington) and Tench Coxe (a delegate to the Continental Congress). His maternal grandparents were Charles Willing, a British born Mayor of Philadelphia in the 1740s and 1750s, and his wife, Ann (n√©e Shippen) Willing. His maternal grandmother was herself a granddaughter of Philadelphia mayor Edward Shippen. Among his large extended family were uncles Thomas Willing (the first president of First Bank of the United States and the Bank of North America) and James Willing, and aunts: Mary Willing (wife of William Byrd III) and Elizabeth Willing (wife of Samuel Powel). Career The Thirteen Factories, the area of Guangzhou to which China's Western trade was restricted from 1757‚Äì1842 Francis engaged in mercantile pursuits with his uncle Thomas Willing and cousin, Thomas Mayne Willing, under the name Willing & Francis. From 1805 to 1822, they focused on the Old China Trade and the transport of opium and tea. His uncle was also a partner in the firm of Willing & Morris with Robert Morris. In 1808, Francis purchased the ship, President Washington from John Brown and, his brother, John Francis of Providence, Rhode Island. Willing & Francis employed many prominent men, including John Hare Powel and William Read, also a Philadelphia merchant, to represent his firm and Willing & Cuwen, and deliver correspondence regarding invoices of goods shipped, and other financial records. The firm worked with many prominent Chinese merchants, including Consequa (his trading name: Pan Changyao ÊΩòÈï∑ËÄÄ), a leading hong merchant. The Bingham, owned by Willing & Francis, is likely the first recorded arrival of an American opium ship in China in 1805. Personal life In the summer of 1794, Francis married his first cousin, Dorothy Willing (1772‚Äì1842). She was one of thirteen children of his maternal uncle, and namesake, Thomas Willing, and his wife, Anne (n√©e McCall) Willing, who were among the wealthiest Americans. Dorothy's siblings included Anne Willing (wife of William Bingham), Thomas Mayne Willing, Elizabeth Willing (wife of William Jackson), Mary Willing, and Abigail Willing (wife of Richard Peters).

It is one of five biodiversity reserves in the province. It is to the east of the Manicouagan Reservoir and includes a large part of the Monts Groulx. It is also part of the central area of the Manicouagan Uapishka Biosphere Reserve.  Name  The name Uapishka comes from the Innu name for the Groulx Mountains and means \\"always snowy rocky peaks\\" or \\"several white mountains\\".  Geography The Uapishka Biodiversity Reserve is located north of Baie-Comeau. It is accessible by Quebec Route 389 from Baie-Comeau and Fermont. The reserve covers the western part of the Monts Groulx massif. It shares a boundary with the proposed Monts-Groulx biodiversity reserve, which has been excluded from the creation of the reserve in order to give it the status of ecological reserve, a superior protection status. The reserve is located in the unorganized territories of Rivi√®re-Mouchalagane, Rivi√®re-aux- Outardes and Lac-Walker, which are respectively in the Caniapiscau, Manicouagan and Sept-Rivi√®res regional county municipalities. The Groulx Mountains form a tabular massif consisting of a long high plateau with several slightly convex peaks exceeding in altitude. The altitude varies from on the shores of the Manicouagan Reservoir to at the top of Mount Veyrier. The Monts Groulx massif is the third largest massif in Quebec by size and the sixth highest. The Groulx Mountains are part of the Grenville Province, a geological division of the Canadian Shield. They are composed of Precambrian rocks that have been deformed during the Labrador and Grenville orogenies. The massif is composed mostly of gabbro-norite, a mafic rock rich in magnesium and iron. The northern part of the massif is mostly composed of anorthosite and the east of gneiss and paragneiss. The rock is visible in outcrops at the top, while the slopes are covered with glacial till deposits up to a few meters thick. The valley bottoms are composed of alluvial deposits laid down by rivers and sandy deposits from glaciers that are often covered with peat. The reserve is located entirely in the basin of the Manicouagan River. It serves as a source for the Toulnustouc, Hart Jaune and Manicouagan rivers. The internal hydrographic network of the reserve is composed of about twenty small lakes and head streams.  Environment  The flora of the reserve varies according to altitude. Lower down the vegetation is mostly black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), mixed with white spruce (Picea glauca) at about , white birch (Betula papyrifera) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). Above the white spruce becomes more common and deciduous trees disappear. Above the forest becomes more sparse with krummholz stands of spruce and fir in the most exposed areas. The tree line is around , above which is alpine heath. Four species at risk are located in the reserve: alpine lady-fern (Athyrium distentifolium var.americum), orange agoseris (Agoseris aurantiaca), highland cudweed (Gnaphalium norvegicum), and clustered lady's mantle (Alchemilla glomerulans). There are twelve exceptional forest ecosystems on the reserve, mostly old white montane spruce forests that have never been logged or impacted by major natural disturbances. Wildlife includes several species of interest. There are six animal species on the reserve that benefit from protection status: wolverine (Gulo gulo), boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), rock vole (Microtus chrotorrhinus) and least weasel (Mustela nivalis). Three other species are also considered of \\"heritage interest\\", the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus).  People  The reserve is crossed by six traplines for the use of the Innu of Pessamit and Uashat-Maliotenam. Obtaining reserve status has not changed their traditional rights and practices. Three hiking trails provide access to the Monts Groulx from km 335, 365 and 350 (winter only) of Route 389. The Monts Groulx are visited annually by about 500 people who come to practice hiking, snowshoeing, telemark skiing and dog sledding. Snowmobiling is limited to altitudes of less than .

Early life and family  Born on 21 May 1832 at Versailles, he was the son of the philosopher Sir George Ramsay, 9th Baronet (died 1871), of Bamff, and his wife Emily Eugenia, n√©e Lennon (died 1885), daughter of an Irish captain.G. E. Cokayne, The Complete Baronetage, vol. 4 (1900), p. 260. He attended Christ Church, Oxford, taking first-class honours in classics in 1854 and in law and modern history the following year, graduating with a BA.  Historian and later life  A student of Christ Church from 1854 to 1861, Ramsay left upon marriage and was called to the bar in 1863 but likely never practised.Richard Lodge, revised by Marjorie Chibnall, \\"Ramsay, Sir James Henry, tenth baronet\\", The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (online ed., Oxford University Press, September 2004). Retrieved 17 September 2019. After examining modern history and law papers at the University of Oxford in the late 1860s, he decided to produce his own history of England, financially enabled when he succeeded to his father's title and estates in 1871, which would comprise 13,872 acres worth ¬£4,570 in 1883. He settled down to his research but produced only articles until the first two volumes of his history series was published in 1892; between then and 1913, he penned five further volumes spanning the period 55 BC to AD 1485. The books were primarily reference histories, offering chronological narratives; Ramsay aimed to give inline citations to his sources following the emerging German practice, although his narrative style was not always popular. As the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes, \\"Ramsay's most original contribution to knowledge was the work he did on the revenues of the kings of England, based on his study of the issue rolls, receipt rolls, and enrolled customs accounts in the Public Record Office\\". This had shortcomings and he omitted to search other relevant sources, but the approach was pioneering and formed the basis of his 1925 monograph, A History of the Revenues of the Kings of England, 1066‚Äì1399. Ramsay received honorary doctorates from the University of Glasgow and the University of Cambridge, and he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1915. He died on 17 February 1925. His daughters included the classicist Agnata Butler and the politician Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl. His son James succeeded to the baronetcy.  References   Further reading  *T. F.

The tour was originally scheduled set to begin on April 5, 2020, in Atlanta, Georgia, and conclude in Foxborough, Massachusetts on August 1 of the same year. In April 2020, following growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, all festival dates were cancelled, while the stadium shows in Brazil and the United States were postponed to 2021. Background and development In an interview with Ryan Seacrest on August 27, 2019, four days after the release of Lover, Swift explained that she was not yet sure of her plans for a tour in support of the album, and stated that she did not want her life to become a constant cycle of releasing an album and immediately touring after release. Swift later hinted in an interview with Zane Lowe in October that family health obligations prevented her from organizing and embarking on a larger-scale tour. The tour was announced through Swift's social media and website on September 17, 2019. Swift explained on social media that: Twelve dates were initially announced, with appearances at festivals and her own shows, with UK and additional international dates to be announced. The July 18, 2020, concert in S√£o Paulo was set to be Swift's first official show ever in both Brazil and the continent of South America. Tickets for the show went on sale on October 25, with more than 100,000 people reportedly queuing online to get tickets, selling out in around 12 hours. Due to overwhelming demand, a second show was added. The tour was also set be her first visits to Denmark, Poland, and Portugal. The show in Berlin was supposed mark her first show in the city in six years since The Red Tour and her first show in Germany in five years since The 1989 World Tour. It sold out seconds after officially going on sale. On October 29, it was announced that Swift would be performing in Spain. The festival shows in Belgium, Norway, France, and Spain would have marked her first performances in each country in nine years since the Speak Now World Tour. In early December 2019, the singer announced that she would be headlining British Summer Time in London on July 11, 2020, becoming her second time headlining the festival with the first being five years prior, incorporated as part of The 1989 World Tour. In mid-December, after much speculation, Swift was confirmed as the headliner for the Glastonbury Festival‚Äîone of the world's biggest music festivals‚Äîon its 50th anniversary in June 2020. She was set to become just the sixth solo female artist to headline in the festival's history. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the festival was cancelled. By mid-April, many of the festival organizers had cancelled events Swift was scheduled to participate in due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. Swift then announced on April 17 she would not go forward with the tour until 2021, nor will she perform live in any venue for the remainder of 2020. She later performed \\"Betty\\" from her eighth studio album, Folklore (2020), live at the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards on September 16, 2020. The impact to the 2021 tour of Folklore, released on July 24, 2020, is unknown at this time. Records Swift's performances at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California were planned to be the stadium's debut event, and she would have been first woman to open an NFL stadium. She would have been the only woman to headline Glastonbury in 2020 and the sixth solo female artist to do so in the festival's fifty-year history until the event was cancelled on March 18, 2020 due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.

In honor and memorial of the men and women who fought and served in the United States armed forces and in particular, those who served from Las Cruces area, the Veterans Memorial Park exhibits monuments to honor their sacrifices made over the course of history. The history recognized begins from as early as the American Revolutionary War to the present day. The Veterans Memorial Park is organized and guided with a trail that directs visitors to the various monuments scattered throughout the park.  History and principles of memorials  For thousands of years there has been architecture built in honor of remembrance, from the time of the pharaohs in Egypt to modern day. Structures can be created to symbolize or remember events, ideas or individuals that have passed on that have had a significant contribution in our world or in our own lives. Memorials are structurally created to help aid in the mourning process and help mourners reach a stage of peace. Mourning is a natural human response that occurs when something has been lost. There can be a need for replacement when something has been taken away. Because of this, memorials give people a place to go to reflect, honor, and pay respect. It also gives future generations the opportunity to remember a significant moment or person in history. Memorials can list names, as well as include photos, and artifacts. War can be associated with powerful memories, especially when it comes to the loss of lives. Veteran memorials are a way to remember and honor those that have been lost through war. These memorials can be seen all across America.  Featured Monuments in Las Cruces  = The Bataan Death March Memorial = Bataan Death March Memorial The Bataan Death March memorial, crafted by sculptor Kelley S. Hestir, features three large, bronze statues of American and Filipino soldiers supporting each other as they walk the six day march of over eighty miles to a Japanese prison camp in World War II. Surrounding the memorial are engraved footprints, representing the men who survived the march and the several who perished. As part of the memorial, the footprints themselves were placed by some of the soldiers who were forced to march across the Bataan Peninsula in 1942. The memorial was dedicated on April 13, 2002, sixty years after the lethal march that took the lives of an estimated five to ten thousand people. Following the completion of this monument, the city of Las Cruces has continued an annual tradition of executing a twenty six mile long march in the White Sands Missile Range in memory of these men represented in the memorial. = Veterans Memorial Wall = The Veterans Memorial Wall in the Memorial park was dedicated on November 11, 2005. 8,188 names are listed on the wall. These are the names of veterans that entered into military service from the county of Do√±a Ana in New Mexico. Those listed served anywhere from the Civil War through Operation Enduring Freedom. Currently, names of veterans that have served in Iraq or Afghanistan are listed on temporary plaques. These will eventually be replaced with permanent plaques. = Garrison Flag = Located on the park grounds is an 80-foot-long flag pole that is designed to hoist a 240 square foot (12‚Äôx20‚Äô) American garrison flag on special occasions and holidays. When the flag is scheduled to be raised, members of the public are typically invited to help veterans in raising and lowering the flag. On days when the garrison flag is not presented, a smaller, alternate post flag is flown instead. The large size of garrison flags first came into fruition during the War of 1812 when the people of Baltimore were expecting an attack from the British. As part of their preparations, Major George Armistead wanted ‚Äúto have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty in seeing it from a distance.‚Äù The great size of the flag has inspired many Americans, including Francis Scott Key when he wrote the words to ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner.‚Äù A similar flag is flown in Las Cruces to instill patriotism in the guests who come to visit. = Veterans Memorial Gazebo = Each monument is strategically located throughout the park along a walkway. At the conclusion of the trail is the Veterans Memorial Gazebo. Easily identifiable along the rim of the gazebo are medallions stamped with the crest of the different branches of military in addition to other logos from a variety of military service organizations. Surrounding the gazebo are also picnic benches and tables with roofing to accommodate various activities and events for visitors. = Korean War Memorial = The Korean War Memorial is a gray, square stone that has the outline of the country of Korea that includes a line showing where the 38th parallel is located. That line shows where the country is now split into North Korea and South Korea. It also lists how many soldiers were casualties, wounded, captured or missing during the war. It also includes a US Army Corps of Engineers castle and plaque commemorating the 2nd Engineer Battalion's participation and heavy losses during the Battle of Kunu-ri. Korean War Memorial in Las Cruces, NM Plaque commemorating the Korean War Battle of Kunu- ri 2nd Engineer Battalion Castle, Korean War Veteran Memorial, Las Cruces NM Two coins were placed into the main stone memorial. They are special gold challenge coins. One coin is facing up and the other is facing down. This was in honor of Chaplain Emil J. Kapaun, CPT, US Army, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his service to his country and fellow soldiers. He died in a Prisoner of War camp on May 23, 1951. = Marine Corps League Memorial = The Marine Corps League received a dedicated monument specifically to honor the Marines who have fought in previous wars and to those who continue to serve this day. The monument consists of an alloyed structure shaped in the Marine Corps emblem, referred to as the ‚ÄúEagle, Globe, and Anchor.‚Äù Within this emblem, the Eagle represents the United States, with the Globe representing the area of responsibility the Marines will cover, and the fouled Anchor to express the aquatic function the Marines serve in junction with the Navy. The emblem is surrounded by some of the titles Marines have earned over the years including slang, such as ‚ÄúThe Few The Proud, ‚ÄúGung-ho,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeather Neck‚Äù to name a few. Next to the monument are the words ‚ÄúSince 1775 Uncommon Valor has been a Common Virtue. United States Marines,‚Äù referring to the founding year of the Marine Corps. USMC spinning sculpture at the Las Cruces Veteran's Memorial Park. Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter in Vietnam War = Vietnam War Memorial = The Vietnam War memorial consists of a large wall that is entitled ‚ÄúVietnam War Memorial: Heroes Never Thanked.‚Äù Below the title, is a collage of images of those who fought in the war from the New Mexico area. To the left and right of these images are placards that describe the advancements and roles of the different branches of military in this time period. Above this wall, hovers an original Vietnam-era Huey helicopter, positioned as if it is coming in for landing. This installment to the park was added on March 1, 2016. = Women Veterans Monument = The Women‚Äôs Veteran Monument located in Las Cruces, is the first monument in New Mexico that is dedicated to women in military service. It was dedicated on March 10, 2018. This monument features six different statues of women wearing uniforms from the military branches of the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, National Guard, and the Navy. Each statue is life-size and made of bronze. The uniforms depicted on the statues are from different eras which include the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, World War I, World War II and the modern era. This project was initiated by the United Military Women of the Southwest, which is a nonprofit organization of women military veterans that served in various branches of the military. The intent of this monument was to show the significant contributions that women have made throughout American military history.  Incidents  In July 2018, the Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter that hovers over the Vietnam memorial was vandalized by two teens one night when they destroyed the windshield, a window, as well as the search light of the Red Cross helicopter, causing an estimated $20,000 worth of damage. Police apprehended the two individuals responsible. Since this incident, Franco Granillo, the city parks administrator has advocated for an increase in park security to ensure the protection of the people and the preservation of the monuments.  Veterans Corner  Las Cruces is proud to be the home of thousands of men and women that have served our country through military service. In order to honor and help the veterans, family of veterans, or those interested in veterans issues the city has dedicated a section of their city‚Äôs website for these people. Veterans Corner is the section of the city‚Äôs website where people can go to find information and resources. Las Cruces has a Veterans Advisory Board that helps advise the city council on any affairs dealing with veterans. It is made up of 13 veterans that are currently living in the Do√±a Ana County. The Veterans Advisory Board is in charge of all physical changes and updates to the Veterans Memorial Park. The city also has a Veterans Corner Liaison that can be contacted for all questions connected to the veterans of Las Cruces, New Mexico.

(September 27, 1887 ‚Äì February 8, 1962) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit, who served as president of Georgetown University in from 1935 to 1942. Born in Washington, D.C., he studied at Gonzaga College before entering the Society of Jesus and continuing his education at St. Andrew-on-Hudson and Woodstock College. He then taught at St. Andrew-on-Hudson and Georgetown University, where he eventually became the university's librarian, and undertook a major improvement of the Georgetown University Library. O'Leary then assumed the presidency of the university in the midst of the Great Depression and, later, World War II. In office, he began a revitalization of the nationwide alumni network from the disparate, regional chapters, re-established the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences as a standalone school within the university, and significantly expanded Georgetown's athletic programs. After, he became the pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown, and then pastor of St. Andrew-on-Hudson. Towards the end of his life, he returned to Georgetown, where he died.  Early life  Arthur Aloysius O'Leary was born on September 27, 1887, in Washington, D.C. His father was a worker on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. O'Leary was educated at Gonzaga College, and his parish was the adjacent St. Aloysius Church. He entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1903, and was sent to St. Andrew- on-Hudson in New York for his scholasticate. He then completed his studies at Woodstock College in Maryland, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy. He went to Georgetown University in 1912, as a professor of philosophy, holding the position until 1916. At the same time, he was also spiritual director for the university. He was finally ordained a priest in 1919, becoming a member of the first class of priests ordained at Georgetown. He then returned to St. Andrew- on-Hudson, where he taught for several years. In 1923, O'Leary became the chief librarian of Georgetown. He made significant improvements to the library, including expanding access to the library to alumni, creating a reference desk, and establishing a system for interlibrary loans. He began in 1935 to comprehensively catalogue all of the university's 177,000 volumes of books according to the Library of Congress Control Number. This signified the first time that the library's holdings in various subjects had all been organized together.  President of Georgetown University  O'Leary presenting Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (future alt=Arthur A. O'Leary and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli The end of Coleman Nevils' second term as president of Georgetown University was due in 1934. However, the faculty and alumni of Georgetown petitioned the Jesuit Superior General in Rome to allow Nevils to remain for an additional year in order to prepare a suitable successor. With the general's approval of the petition, in October 1935, when Nevils was sent to Japan for three months to represent the American Red Cross at an international conference, he appointed O'Leary as acting president in his stead. In July of that year, O'Leary was officially appointed president of the university, becoming the first native of Washington, D.C. to hold the office. The inauguration ceremony on November 23 was attended by several justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, government officials, many foreign diplomats, delegates of several hundred educational institutions and learned societies, and the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, Amleto Giovanni Cicognani. His presidency was largely shaped by the ongoing Great Depression. By the 1930s, Georgetown's alumni association had become largely defunct. In the latter half of the decade, several alumni chapters around the country, especially driven by alumni of Georgetown Law School, had begun to reconstitute. In O'Leary's first month of office, he announced that he would establish an office for organizing alumni nationally, not just in regional chapters. This goal did not immediately materialize, and in 1937, Edmund A. Walsh, the founder of the School of Foreign Service, urged O'Leary to revitalize the alumni association. In response, O'Leary traveled around the country in the spring of 1938 to reorganize the regional chapters and appointed one of Georgetown's professors of English as the first secretary of the national association; the board of directors officially approved the national alumni organization in the fall of 1938, which began compiling a national directory and publishing a newsletter. alt=Sketch of Arthur O'Leary in academic regalia O'Leary was a proponent of expanding Georgetown's athletic programs, in part due to the recognition that they proved to be profitable for other universities, and greatly expanded scholarships available to athletes. Unlike his predecessor, O'Leary was a rather conservative figure. In 1935, O'Leary warned of the prevalence of communism in the United States. The following year, The Hoya, Georgetown's student newspaper, echoed this sentiment, reporting on the growth of the Communist Party in the United States and the prevalence of communism among faculty across the country. In light of protests at college campuses around the country against involvement in World War II, such as the presence of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps on campuses, and increasing political tension, O'Leary requested that the Jesuit provincial superior appoint a censor in 1937 to review any public speeches that would be given by Jesuits, so as to remove any political overtones. Due to the national mobilization during the War, Georgetown's campus became a testing ground for the Army Specialized Training Center. During O'Leary's presidency, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was re-established as an independent school within the university. This was part of O'Leary's aim to have Georgetown meet the Association of American Universities' standard for graduate education. He also increased the number of graduate faculty and students and made major significant improvements to the library's holdings. By 1937, the school began awarding doctoral degrees once again in some departments. In the law school, O'Leary decided to condense the two leadership positions of dean and regent (the latter of which was always a Jesuit) into a single position, due to the resignation of the previous dean. Toward the end of his presidency, O'Leary's health began to deteriorate. He underwent surgery to remove kidney stones in 1937. Soon after the operation, he again became seriously ill and nearly died. As a result, he went to New England and Jamaica for several months to recuperate, returning to the university in October 1937. With his illness progressing, in December 1942, the Jesuit authorities took the unusual step of replacing the president of the university during wartime, naming Lawrence C. Gorman as his successor.  Later years  In 1947, O'Leary replaced James A. McCarl as the pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. Obtaining permission from the Metropolitan Police Department, he began the practice of students at the Holy Trinity School using N Street as their playground for recess. He remained pastor until 1953, when he was succeeded by Emory Ross. His final assignment was as pastor of St. Andrew-on-Hudson, which he held until his death. O'Leary died on February 8, 1962, at Georgetown University Hospital. The requiem mass was held at St. Aloysius Church in Washington, D.C.

The sanctuary was destroyed and rebuilt a few times over many centuries and has today produced many artefacts that allow historians to better understand exactly what went on in the sanctuary during that period of time. This sanctuary held many rituals, that included cult-like behaviour by both young males and females in varying ways and has also since revealed many artifacts due to multiple excavations that have helped to deliver new information on acts and behaviours that have occurred in at the temple in Orthia.  Sanctuary  The cult of Orthia (Greek ·ΩàœÅŒ∏ŒØŒ±) was common to the four villages originally constituting Sparta: Limnai, in which it is situated, Pitana, Kynosoura and Mesoa. Chronologically speaking, historians believe that it likely came after the cult to the city-goddess Athena Œ†ŒøŒªŒπŒø·ø¶œáŒøœÇ (Polio≈©khos) \\"protectress of the city\\" or ŒßŒ±ŒªŒ∫ŒØŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ / Khalk√≠oikos \\"of the bronze house\\". thumb The sanctuary is located in Peloponnese, on the south bank of the Eurotas River, at ancient Sparta. This location was above the reach of all but the severest flooding which began near the start of and continued on into the 6th century BCE. After the flood caused extensive damage to the site, it was then lifted beyond the reach of the water using sand that formed a blanket-like cover, isolating artifacts existing beneath. The original sanctuary was believed to be built in ca. 700 B.C.E. The oldest relics, pottery fragments from the late Greek Dark Ages, indicate that the cult has probably existed since the 10th century BCE, but not before (Rose in Dawkins 1929:399). A second temple was built around 570 BCE, perhaps during the joint reign of Leon of Sparta and Agasicles, when military successes provided funds, however, it was moved towards the north, built atop portions of the old temple and is now facing S/E. The terrain was raised and consolidated, undoubtedly following erosion caused by the Eurotas. An altar and a temple of limestone, oriented the same way as the previous buildings, were built on a bed of river sand. The surrounding wall was also enlarged, and at this stage took on a rectangular form. The second temple was entirely rebuilt in the 2nd century BCE, during the Hellenistic age, except for the altar. The second temple was utilized only for a bit up until the 4th century when it was then thought to be forgotten about. Just before the site was abandoned in the 3rd century CE, the Romans built a theatre around the temple and altar then, introducing a new altar in order to welcome tourists to the diamastigosis.  Cult  = Cult elements = votive offering (National Archaeological Museum of Athens) may reflect the cult image. Many kinds of celebrations were conducted at the temple, one of the original being the Procession of the Girls. It was thought that this celebration occurred when the temple opened at the very beginning. All of the details are not known as to what exactly occurred during this celebration, however, it was thought that the girls of Sparta brought gifts to offer Artemis while they sang songs to the Parthenos. Many inscriptions were found in relation to this celebration, ensuring the seriousness taken when worshipping the goddess. The Cult at Sparta were often found to use masks that imitated the appearance of various animals. This was because during a special feast named the Syracusan feast of Artemis, there could be a surrounding of creatures circling Artemis, it was of importance that one would be a female lion. In connection with this, offerings at the temple usually including those of animals, at Sparta, the bear was seen as a significant symbol. It was suggested that Artemis Orthia and the bear were linked in ways that relate to mothering and the birthing of children. Because Artemis is related to the ideas of nature and nourishment, she is also thought to be fruitful. Many myths portray her as a figure that has a society of nymphs serving her as royalty along with satyrs that come from Dionysos, therefore, causing females at a young age to become very honourable towards the cult. Young females seen honouring the cult were considered to be celibate but performed their dancing in such a way that would be considered improper and very hyper sexualized. It was also noted that the statue representing Artemis for the cult was removed out of the sanctuary temporarily by the girls while their dance was performed. Men also gave praise to the Greek goddess, because of such, the ephebes could seen being beaten with objects such as whips at the altar of the temple in Sparta, diamastigosis. There were three types of games thought to be played in the sanctuary by young boys. The first and even the second game were thought to be a battle of singing or who could create the best music while the last game was thought to be a hunting game as it required 10 youth in order to play. One game was not known as the writing that explained it could not be properly deciphered at the time of discovery. The cult addressed a xoanon (archaic wooden effigy) of malevolent reputation, for it was reputedly from Tauride, whence it was stolen by Orestes and Iphigenia, according to Euripides. Orientalizing carved ivory images found at the site show the winged goddess grasping an animal or bird in either hand in the manner of the Potnia Theron; half-finished ivories from the site show that their facture was local (Rose in Dawkins 1929:400). Pausanias describes the subsequent origin of the diamastigosis (ritual flagellation): > I will give other evidence that the Orthia in Lacedaemon is the wooden image > from the foreigners. Firstly, Astrabacus and Alopecus, sons of Irbus, son of > Amphisthenes, son of Amphicles, son of Agis, when they found the image > straightway became insane. Secondly, the Spartan Limnatians, the > Cynosurians, and the people of Mesoa and Pitane, while sacrificing to > Artemis, fell to quarrelling, which led also to bloodshed; many were killed > at the altar and the rest died of disease. Whereat an oracle was delivered > to them, that they should stain the altar with human blood.

In addition to the flagellation of the diamastigosis, the cult entailed individual dances by young men and dances by choruses of girls. For the young men, the prize is a sickle, which implies an agricultural ritual. The presence of ex-votos (votive offerings) attests to the popularity of the cult: clay masks representing old women or hoplites as well as lead and terracotta figures showing men and women playing the flute, lyre, or cymbals, or mounting a horse.  Winged Artemis  thumb The archaic winged Artemis, represented in many ex-votos from the 8th century to the later sixth, lingered longest here as Artemis Orthia. The doll- like figures of the goddess Artemis are consistently exhibited wearing a set of wings rather than placing an animal in her hands or by her side. Many differences can be observed from one figurine to the next, with the most important being in how the wings are designed as well as the \\"polos\\", however, neither holds any relevance. The body of the figurine slowly declined in detail over time, specifically in the structure of the wings, followed by a disappearance of the head, stick-like feet and a new triangle-shaped frame. Some of the figures that were created around 600 B.C. were sometimes found to have messages devoted to Artemis Orthia in-scripted in the piece being offered. = Diamastigosis= The cult of Orthia gave rise to Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±œÉœÑŒØŒ≥œâœÉŒπœÇ / diamastigosis (from Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ≥·ø∂ / diamastig√¥, \\"to whip harshly\\"), where the √©phƒìboi were flogged, as described by Plutarch, Xenophon, Pausanias, and Plato. Cheeses were piled on the altar and guarded by adults with whips. The young men would attempt to get them, braving the whips. This was done as a way to prepare boys at a young age for the life they will face as an adult and as a soldier. It was deemed as a rite of passage. During the Roman period, according to Cicero, the ritual became a blood spectacle, sometimes to the death, with spectators from all over the empire. An amphitheatre had to be built in the 3rd century CE to accommodate the tourists. Libanios indicates that the spectacle was attracting the curious as late as the 4th century CE.  Votive offerings  Votive offerings found in the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia were most often small but presented in large abundances. During the Archaic timeline, these offerings came in many variations and forms, leading to the assumption that the items were not specifically chosen as something that would pertain to or be associated with the god/goddess being praised. Instead, the offerings were thought to be selected from a more personal standpoint rather than something more representative of the honoured one. The idea of generosity was more important than the item itself that was being given and the connection it may of had to the god/goddess. Sanctuaries located in Laconia were often found to make offerings that were made from lead and formed into many shapes, the most common being the shape of a wreath. Many of these wreaths could often be found linked together by the left over lead still connected to the used equipment. Lead offerings make-up over 100,000 of the lead offerings (now stationed in the Liverpool collections) that were discovered during professional digs at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. The most popular figurines discovered in the Sanctuary consisted of warriors, female characters, olympian deities, musicians and dancers. In relation to the representation of animals, deer were commonly found to be offered and were recognized as a replacement votive that directly related to hunting and preying. Tiny sized vases, another type of votive offering, first made an appearance in The Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at the very start of the Archaic timeline. Many of the tiny vases that were found were hand crafted while others were created using a wheel and had handles attached to the side. Most often, the tiny vases were not glossed over, but the occasional time they could be found glossed over in black. Offerings made of terracotta were also found to be used in the sanctuary and were usually self-crafted or moulded into various shapes and sizes. One of the most unique terracotta votives discovered in the Sanctuary of Artemis at Orthia were masks that were seemingly created to mimic the human appearance. These mask votives were thought to perfectly fit the face structure of a human, however, some masks that were discovered appeared to be smaller in size.  Excavation of the site  The site was brought to light by the British School of Archaeology during their digs in Laconia, 1906-10 after doll like figures and other tiny items were discovered in the ground around the river, under the site. At the time, the unexcavated site appeared to consist only of a ruined Roman theatre, largely pillaged after the foundation of modern Sparta in 1834, and about to collapse into the river. The archaeologists, under the leadership of R. M. Dawkins, quickly found evidence of Greek occupation. Dawkins writes, \\"The Roman theatre was easy to protect...a large quantity of ancient objects which by the light they shed on primitive Sparta, have given this dig capital significance.\\" A long, continuous sequence of archaeological strata was revealed. Two distinct areas were marked and used to excavate the site entirely, they were labeled as trench A and trench B. Trench A covered the southern area of the sanctuary, running through the amphitheatre, trench B was marked only 10 meters from trench A still on the south, covering all parts of the infrastructure. Trench A delivered many artifacts, likely thought to be items sacrificed to the goddess, deep within the soil below the amphitheatre. The most incredible discovery made from trench A was the abundance of masks, believed to be related to the cult. Trench B was dug too far away from the main site, based on the minimal findings within. Artifacts found within the trenches included ceramics, geometrically styled vessels, doll like figures, sculptures and more. A sign of human life at its earliest is noted within the darkest of dirt filled with many artifacts that lie directly beneath the altar of the temple. The piles of artifacts could be found nowhere else at the site in such abundances other than the spot in which it was believed the goddess was being worshipped. The remnants found, including bones, were thought to be related to the cult and were discovered to be the remains of animals that were offered by fire to Orthia. As well as the British Museum,British Museum Collection a significant group of offerings were placed in the World Museum of Liverpool, United Kingdom, and are said to exhibit pieces that come from all time periods that the temple was utilized (the 8th century BC to the 3rd century AD). Although there is information to suggest that the sanctuary was utilized long after the 8th century, most of the discovered votives were buried into the ground far before the mid 7th century. The votives can be dated back late in the 5th century BC while the largest amount was found near the end of the 6th century BC.

She joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service shortly before the Second World War and served in the UK, East Africa and Palestine. After the war she transferred to the newly formed Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC). Heaney rose through the ranks and was honoured with appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire. She was promoted to the rank of brigadier, appointed director of WRAC and Aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II in 1970. As part of her role Heaney visited the United States to study their ongoing integration of women into the army and recommended that the process proceed in the UK on a gradual basis. She instituted changes to make it easier for women in the British Army to choose their branch of service. After her retirement in 1973, she lived in Edinburgh where she volunteered with the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and supported a local hospice.  Early life  Sheila Anne Elizabeth Heaney was born in Liverpool on 11 June 1917. She was the second of four children of Francis Heaney, a surgeon, and his wife Anne Summers, who was American. As a child she was a keen horse rider and hunt follower and holidayed with her family in Cornwall, the Lake District and Ireland. Heaney developed an interest in sociology after visiting the poorer parts of London with her father on his work. She studied at Huyton College and graduated from the University of Liverpool in 1938. Heaney then attended the Loughborough College of Technology before finding work at the human resources department of retailer Marks & Spencer.  Auxiliary Territorial Service  As tensions increased in the lead-up to the Second World War Heaney joined the British Army's Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and encouraged her co- workers to join up. On 26 January 1939 she was appointed company assistant (equivalent to second lieutenant) and served in the 1st West Lancashire Platoon. Heaney afterwards spent a year at the ATS training centre before being appointed second in command of the Salisbury Plain District Group. When the ATS reformed its rank structure on 30 May 1941 she transferred to the rank of second subaltern. From January to April 1944 Heaney attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Afterwards she carried out administrative work on a posting to British East Africa. From 1946 she served in Mandatory Palestine, a posting that included the period of the 1947-48 civil war. Heaney transferred from her war substantive commission to a permanent commission on 1 January 1947 and was promoted to junior commander (captain) the following month. On 20 March 1947 she was awarded the Efficiency Medal for long service, at which point she held the rank of temporary senior commander (equivalent to major). Heaney returned to the UK in July 1948 and was awarded the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945 and the General Service Medal with Palestine clasp for her service. She served at the ATS headquarters for 3 months before being appointed deputy assistant adjutant- general at the War Office.  Women's Royal Army Corps  Heaney decided on a permanent career in the army in 1949 and transferred to the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) when it was founded on 1 February 1949. She transferred initially in the rank of subaltern (with seniority of 2 September 1941) but was immediately promoted to junior commander (with seniority of 2 September 1945). Heaney was awarded the Efficiency Decoration on 13 April 1951. By this time the WRAC had adopted the British Army's officer ranks and she held the substantive rank of captain and temporary rank of major. During 1952 Heaney served on the headquarters of 79th Anti-Aircraft Brigade of the Royal Artillery and on 2 September was promoted to the permanent rank of major. From 1952 to 1955 Heaney served as a trainer in Western Command and from 1955 served with 1 Independent Company WRAC. Her service was recognised with appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire on 9 June 1955. Heaney spent two years with 140 Provost Company before being posted to the War Office in September 1959. From July 1961 she served at the WRAC School of Instruction and from April 1962 with the organisation's medical unit, followed by a stint in the records office. Heaney was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 24 February 1963 and from October 1965 served as assistant director, WRAC at Northern Command. She was promoted to colonel on 30 June 1967 and from July served as assistant adjutant-general at the Ministry of Defence. Heaney was promoted to the rank of brigadier on 30 June 1970 and was appointed director of the WRAC on 1 September. On 29 September she was appointed an Aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II. Heaney visited the United States in 1972 to study the ongoing integration of women into its army. She advocated similar change in the United Kingdom but on a more gradual basis (full integration in the British Army was achieved with the disbandment of WRAC in 1992). One key change Heaney was able to introduce was the ability of women in the British Army to choose their arm of service or branch. Heaney was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1973 and retired on 18 June.  Later life  After retirement Heaney moved to Edinburgh to look after her widowed mother. She served on the military education committee of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University Officers' Training Corps and joined the Women's Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS). Heaney helped the WRVS with delivery of meals on wheels and assisting the elderly with shopping and travel. She later became WRVS district organiser for Edinburgh and was its chairman for Scotland from 1977. Heaney became disabled in later life, possibly as a result of eating poisonous mushrooms while serving with the army in Kenya. She retired from the WRVS in 1981 and afterwards served on the committee of St Columba's Hospice in Edinburgh. A heavy smoker throughout her life, Heaney developed lung cancer and died in the hospice. She was cremated and her funeral was held at St James's Episcopal Church in Goldenacre, Edinburgh on 6 February 1991.

Meanwhile, Bob notices something and went to a mental institute in Leeds and called Karan telling him that he knows who's spirit is doing all these but before he could tell who is behind all these, Bob himself is killed by that ghost who had previously killed Barkha. After more investigation Simran found that Karan was with a girl on the night his wife died but that girl was missing in police report. After consulting to a demonologist it was revealed that that girl was possessed and Karan was also possessed and being under possession he actually killed Barkha and that's why he didn't remember that night very much. Further it was revealed that Barkha was in a lesbian relationship with a girl but after instead married Karan for fame and money. When that girl blackmailed Barkha to tell the truth or bare the consequences, she was taken to the mental institute . There she met Simran's father (Vikram Bhatt),a doctor.

He was discovered too late for the ship to go back, only when the ship was off \\"Worms Head\\" (Island in Front of Rhossili). He got away all right and the ship sailed round Cape Horn, and from that point, the association with the copper ore trade lasted several years.

Served well until broken up at Connah's Quay in 1960 After an intense career in the Merchant Navy which lasted more than 20 years and led him all around the world with notably 10 voyages round Cape Horn, Gough became a Swansea Sea Pilot, operating in the Bristol Channel which is one of the most dangerous shipping lanes in the world. He stayed in function as a sea pilot for 27 years, first under the Old Harbor Trust and later under the Pilotage authority, and rendered very good service (Pilotage License granted 14 March 1904 and renewed every year). He first served as a Master Pilot on the Pilot Cutter \\"Beaufort\\"(first steam pilot cutter to be built in the world for the purpose of laying alongside vessels at sea to embark and disembark pilots) from 1904 to 1924 and then he served from January 1, 1925, on the cutter \\"Roger Beck\\" (named by the Pilots after Harbour Trustee & Swansea greatest citizen at the time, died in 1923) until his death in 1930.

The new cutter ordered by the Pilots was an improvement of the Beaufort and was build in accordance to many years experience, being oil driven and capable of developing a speed of 10 knots. Gough was a member of the United Kingdom Pilots' Association which protected the pilots' interests.United Kingdom Pilots' Association Souvenir Handbook June 1925 (Albert Davies Printer Swansea) Amongst its members, he was very active to defend the Pilot's interests and on the 15th August 1908, they met at the Albert Hall, Winston Churchill (President of the Board of Trade) who was in town, at the time, to meet the miners. The concern was the Tonnage Bill question cropping up and Churchill told them that \\"the Pilot's position was having his earnest consideration\\".\\"Winston\\" and the Pilots (The Cambrian 21 Aug 1908) His reception was said to be most cordial throughout.  During World War I  He also took part in WWI, navigated in war zones and was awarded with the Mercantile Marine War Medal and the British War Medal both issued on 15 July 1921(unfortunately medals lost). With the Swansea Pilots, he organized during the war the delivery of useful goods to the 6th Welsh Regiment serving in France in November 1914.\\"From the Sea Pilots\\" - The Cambria Daily Leader 30 Nov 1914 He also participated during the war years, as a representative of the Swansea Sea Pilots, to generous subscriptions towards the fund for providing Christmas Day gifts to the widows and children of Swansea soldiers who fell at the front.\\"For the widows and dependents\\" - The Cambria Daily Leader, 18 December 1916  Freemason and Record round Cape Horn  Gough was a freemason, member of the Carradoc lodge (n¬∞1573), the Talbot Chapter lodge (n¬∞1323) and the Beaufort lodge (n¬∞3834). In June 1925 (16th, 17th & 18th), for the United Kingdom Pilot's conference held in Swansea by the United Kingdom Pilot's Association, as Captain Harris, Captain William John Davies Welsh trade union leader and Captain Gough were chiefly responsible for the arrangements for entertaining the delegates, as members of the Reception Committee, The South Wales Daily Post mentions \\"Captains' Gough excellent record of 10 voyages round Cape Horn on great sailing ships known as cape honers\\".\\"Pilots' conference\\" - The South Wales Daily Post 19 June 1925  Associated with the worldwide Copper ore trade in Swansea (1883-1904)  Gough was a Swansea Cape Horner who sailed intensively around the world in sailing ships known as Copper Barques from 1883 to 1904, at a time when Swansea was the world center for Copper Production known as \\"Copperopolis\\"\\"Copperopolis\\" -The Cambrian 1st Feb 1907 (manufacturing almost 70% of the world's copper goods) until 1923 when Copper-smelting ceased entirely in Swansea. In the 19th century, Copper ore was shipped to Swansea (one of the busiest ports in the world), to be smelted and turned into pure copper ingots (because Swansea had lots of coal needed for this industry). The copper barques on which Gough embarked, were then sailing to Chile, North America, Cuba, South Africa and even Australia to load with Copper ore. The Barques were also leaving Swansea loaded with Coal, fire bricks, slate, steam engine parts, copper ingots, tinplate, other materials and even passengers. \\"Coal out and ore in\\" that's how Joseph Conrad described the copper ore trade between Swansea and the Chilean coast in \\"The Mirror of the Sea\\" published in 1906, \\"deep-loaded on both ways\\"\\"Why I'm in ore of the copper barque\\" - Walesonline.co.uk 6 may 2013 Gough's Pilotage License 1904 Few ports had more Cape Horners than Swansea in those days and they were revered. Gough like all the other Cape horners, had to cover immense distances and a voyage from Swansea to Chile and back again could take a year or more (7000 to 8000 miles). These voyages were at high risks and crews had to contend with terrifying conditions\\"Off Cape Horn\\" (Evening Express 21st Dec 1895) and illnesses: violent winds and currents, frost, breakers and raging seas, snow, icebergs round Cap Horn, diseases such as yellow fever, poor food, being washed away and drown, fires due to coal damp storage conditions, shipwreck, and many men would not survive.

History  The band was formed in August 1989, when around a guitarist, a violinist, a saxophonist (young musicians gave an impromptu concert in Brest city‚Äôs central park) spontaneously gathered about 150 people. The boys were just playing music, and suddenly, after the ending of one of songs, they heard applause behind themselves. Touched, the players realized that there is a need to come together in a band. In the same year, they started to rehearse, wrote first songs and, a few months later, were invited to tour across Yakutia. To its 17th anniversary, the band gave a big concert with the orchestra at the Palace of the Republic, which recording was released on the DVD \\"17 Live\\" in 2006. A feature of the band is that music is written by not one but all members. The band has been very often toured abroad: with performances, musicians attended the Baltic countries, Ukraine, Romania, Poland, Germany, Canada, Russia, the US, the UK, South Korea, South Africa, and more regions. On August 3, 2019, the band celebrated the 30th anniversary with a major concert with the orchestra at Lenin Square in Brest. Name  Band members chose the name \\"Spasenie\\" (; ) ‚Äì indicating that they see music as salvation ‚Äì while on a train to Yakutia in the early 1990s.  The language question  For the first 15 years of its existence, the band sang exclusively in Russian, but with the release of the album Crossing the Jordan, the English language became heard much more frequently in its songs. Vocalist Igor Mukha answered Volha Samusik from Muzykalnaya Gazeta on the language question this way, \\"We live in Brest. This is actually the border. Its peculiar feature is the mixture of languages. There are a lot of words from Ukrainian, Polish... There was never neither the clean Belarusian nor the Russian language. Therefore, we sang not in the native but in the Russian language. Although I recognize the indisputable melodicism of Belarusian, English is also very musically flexible. If we compare it with Russian, then to sing in the last one is harder because of all these combinations of letters \\"br,\\" ‚Äústr,\\" etc. So it was not difficult to switch for us.\\"  Social activity  Every year the band holds the rock music festival-competition \\"X-Star\\" (since 2005) and organizes an annual large youth concert in Brest called the \\"\\" () (since 2009). The participants also oppose abortion. In 2019 the band together with National Academy of Sciences of Belarus prepared and launched a guided tour \\"Brest is the city of the Bible.\\"  Discography  = Albums = * –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π (1992) * –í–æ–∑—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥–æ–º–æ–π (musical) (1992) * –°—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–µ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ (1992) * –ú–æ–π –ë–æ–≥ —Å–∫–∞–ª–∞ (1993) * –¢–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –¢—ã (1995) * –ß–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ –±–µ–∑ –∑—É–±–∏–ª–∞ (1997) * –ë—å—é—Ç —á–∞—Å—ã (1998) * Exit (1999) * –õ–µ—Ç–∏—Ç –±–µ–∑–∂–∞–ª–æ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è (2000) * ... –∞ –°–æ–ª–Ω—Ü–µ –∑–∞ –∫–æ—Ä–º–æ–π (2001) * –ï–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–ª—å–±–æ–º (2001) * –ë–µ–∑ —Å–ª–æ–≤ –æ —Ç–æ–º –∂–µ (feat.

Apart from Thurso, there are no large settlements, only small hamlets and scattered settlements in places. Shalmstry fits this trend as it is a remote, small, settlement in the countryside, with some houses and farmland. Local area The local area around Shalmstry consists mainly of grassland. There are a few farms, tracks, paths and settlements but the nearest town is Thurso which is a 6 minute drive away along the A9. To walk it takes about 51 minutes. There are little facilities in the area. There are no bus stops and no known pay phones. Taxis are available. The nearest post office and other basic facilities are nearby but supermarkets and emergency services are in Thurso. With it being at the top of Scotland, all the big cities are south, apart from Wick which is to the East. But you would have to drive to get to cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh. Local transport There are no public bus services running through Shalmstry. Trains to Inverness can be found at Thurso railway station.

One type of blowback is caused when atmospheric air blows down the locomotive's chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with potentially serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. Such blowbacks can be prevented by opening the blower before closing the regulator. Similar blowback can be caused by debris or other obstructions in the smokebox. In the days when steam-hauled trains were common in the United Kingdom, blowbacks occurred fairly frequently. In a 1955 report on an accident near Dunstable, the Inspector wrote: He also recommended that the British Transport Commission carry out an investigation into the causes of blowbacks. Blowbacks can also occur when a steam tube (or pipe) bursts in the boiler, allowing high-pressure steam to enter the firebox and thus egress onto the footplate. Other potential causes are unused mining explosives in the coal used to fuel the engine, and unburnt gases collecting in the firebox and then igniting.  Examples  The 1965 Winsford railway accident was caused by a blowback. Driver Wallace Oakes died as a result, and his fireman Gwilym Roberts was severely injured.

It is endemic to southern China, mainly in the Pearl River basin south of the Nanling Mountains. It is extremely endangered and may no longer exist in the wild.  Discovery and description  It was described in 1924 (as Megalobatrachus sligoi) by Edward George Boulenger from a captive specimen held in the London Zoo. This individual was originally held in the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens and may have originated from Guangxi or Guangdong Province, and was likely one of many giant salamanders captured from the mainland and placed in the Botanical Gardens' fountain, all of which had escaped. During a particularly violent storm in April 1920, a large drain pipe in the Gardens burst, carving a large depression into the land that the escaped salamander was washed into. It was captured and kept in a large circular basin, where it was fed daily with live tadpoles and occasionally beef. The captured salamander was later seen by George Ulick Browne, the then-Marquess of Sligo, as he was touring the area. Browne persuaded the then-governor of Hong Kong, Reginald Edward Stubbs, to present the salamander to the Zoological Society of London. Upon receiving the individual, Boulenger found it to be physically distinct from \\"Megalobatrachus maximus\\" (the former species into which his father, George Albert Boulenger, lumped both the Japanese giant salamander and Chinese giant salamander) and it thus likely represented a new species. During Boulenger's description, he named the species M. sligoi in honor of Browne's title.  Taxonomy  Despite Boulenger's classification, the species was later synonymized with the Chinese giant salamander (A. davidianus), and eventually forgotten. However, a study published in 2018 found that the Chinese giant salamander actually consisted of numerous clades restricted to different river basins, with many of them being distinct enough to be considered separate species. A further study of museum specimens found that the South Chinese population likely represented a distinct species and was also the subject of Boulenger's initial study, and thus supported the revival of A. sligoi as a distinct species.  Size  It is possible that A. sligoi may be the largest extant amphibian today, a superlative generally attributed to A. davidianus. The largest known Andrias specimen was a individual captured near Guiyang in Guizhou Province in the early 1920s. Although historical specimens collected near Guizhou do not have enough usable DNA to identify the species they belong to, more recent specimens collected from the region cluster with A. sligoi, meaning that the largest collected individual may have been an A. sligoi, rather than A. davidianus or a related species.  Threats and conservation  The South China giant salamander is highly endangered by overharvesting due to its status as a delicacy and use in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is unknown if any wild populations survive today. A large commercial trade in the species and its relatives was already established by the late 20th century, and very large-scale farms now exist for breeding giant salamanders for food and medicinal purposes. Several specimens collected in the 1990s originate from outside the native range of the species, and likely represent either translocated individuals that escaped the trade or individuals donated by or purchased from traders. Indiscriminate farming may also promote hybridization between different species, further contaminating the each unique species' gene pool. For this reason, it has been proposed that A. sligoi be classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Proposed conservation actions include creating a separate management plan for A. sligoi, identifying and protecting sites that remnant wild populations may possibly occur at, identifying captive individuals and preventing hybridization or translocation, and creating a genetically pure founder population for the purpose of captive breeding and release.

Initially, the institute and local police claimed the cause of death to be suicide, however, the family claims that she was murdered. Fingerprint samples and Chandani's scarf were then sent to The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) but this investigation did not yield any substantial findings and so could not conclude a cause of death. The post-mortem performed pointed that a sexual act- rape had been committed with her. A later autopsy report commissioned by the Sindh high court found evidence of murder and sexual assault. This report also showed that she was asphyxiated to death by strangulation with a rope. This purported chain of events was based on evidence of male DNA on her clothes and body. Vaginal swab examination showed evidence of sexual contact. Death Doctors revealed that there was a choking mark by wire on her neck. Police said that the girl may have committed suicide but her brother Vishal told the media he was convinced that his sister was murdered. He also appealed to the public to stand up for them as they are indeed a minority in Pakistan The university vice-chancellor Anila told the media that Chandani's room was locked. She further added that the actual cause of death is yet to be confirmed. According to the post-mortem report, no marks of torture have been found on the body. SSP Larkana is investigating the incident and had sealed her room for further investigation. It is suspected by some that Chandani might have been a victim of murder by fellow students. An investigation is looking into the leaked medical paper which Chandani opposed and raised her voice for. Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered a judicial inquiry into the murder of Chandani.

It flows from the Petit lac Manicouagan to the Manicouagan Reservoir. Location The Hart Jaune River is in the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Mouchalagane in the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality. It forms the outlet of the Petit lac Manicouagan at the Hart-Jaune Dam, which feeds the 45.5 MW Hart-Jaune generating station. The river flows southwest to the Manicouagan Reservoir. It is about long, and has a vertical drop of . The sources of the water are in the Uapishka Biodiversity Reserve, which also feeds the Toulnustouc and Manicouagan rivers. The Hart Jaune is one of the major inlets to the Manicouagan Reservoir, along with the Mouchalagane, Seignelay, Themines and Petite Riviere Manicouagan. The reservoir is drained by the Manicouagan River. Quebec Route 389 from Baie-Comeau to Labrador City crosses the river at Km 375 over a small wooden one-way bridge. In February 2017 the Quebec government asked for bids to replace the bridge, estimated to cost CDN$1‚àí5 million. The new bridge was to be a concrete slab type bridge over steel girders. Name The Innu name for the river is Uishauneu Shipu, meaning river where there are alders. The name \\"Hart\\" refers to a strip of a flexible wood such as alder, hazel or dogwood used for binding. \\"Hart jaune\\" may refer to the grey alder (Alnus incana), which provides a yellow dye. The name was approved in 1945 and appears on a 1962 map of Quebec. The river has also been called the Rivi√®re La Fert√©. Geology The course of the river roughly corresponds to the Hart Jaune Shear Zone (HJSZ) as proposed by Hynes et al. (2000). Southeast extension occurred along the shear zone during the Rigolet Pulse 1010‚Äì980 Ma) of the Grenville orogeny.

Jordan, Jr. is an Associate Professor and Research Archivist at the University of Virginia, Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library. He has published several books and articles, as well as given lectures and taught workshops, on the American Civil War and African American history.Who's Who in the South and Southwest¬Æ [Marquis(tm)]. 25th edition, 1997-98. New Providence, NJ: Marquis Who's Who, 1997.Directory of American Scholars. Tenth edition, Volume 1: History, Archaeology, & Area Studies. Detroit: Gale Group, 2002. [DrAS 10A] He has appeared on television several times as a consulting historian in matters of African American history and genealogy, as well lectured at conferences, universities and events, some which were televised on C-CPAN. He has written several books and been awarded for his research in the Civil War and African American history and is one of the leading figures in developing black American history.  Education  Jordan holds history degrees and graduated with honors from both Norfolk State University and Old Dominion University. Since 2015, he has been an affiliated faculty member of the John L. Nau III Center for Civil War History, University of Virginia College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences.  Career  In 1979, Jordan began working as an archivist at the University of Virginia. Since then, he has held several different positions including university records manager and associate curator of technical services. His responsibilities involve outreach, reference, answering inquiries, processing, organizing, recommendations and special project work. In 2003, Jordan was named the senior consulting archivist on the University of Virginia's possible collaboration with the University of Botswana. He spent many years on a solo project of processing the papers of Armstead L. Robinson (1947-1955). These files and papers encompass \\"the development of black studies during the 1960s; the 19th century American South; the Civil War and Reconstruction; and life as an African American student and faculty member at Yale, the State University of New York, the University of Rochester, UCLA, and the University of Virginia from the 1960s through the 1990s.\\" He has studied African American history, especially the Civil War, extensively. In a 2017 interview with John Coski of the American Civil War Museum, Jordan explains the power of monuments and statues: > There are an estimated 13,000 Civil War memorials in the United States. Far > too often throughout American history, statues and civic spaces have been > ostensibly weaponized as a means of empowerment or oppression. > Unquestionably, Confederate monuments reflect the politicized racial > attitudes of their communities but in this case somebody‚Äôs heroes are > usually someone else‚Äôs villains. Many Americans consider them racist because > they openly honor secessionist proslavery war heroes--and traitors. None > denounces slavery. Given the current pugnacious political climate, we must > understand why Confederate monument defenders stridently praise those who > defended slavery and secession while a new interracial post-civil rights > generation demands their removal as evocative of sanctified traitors, racist > slaveholders and white supremacy. Many of his writings encompass the duality of the Civil War, black soldiers fighting against or for slavery, and the repercussions of the war's outcome. He often specifically notes statues and monuments of the Civil War and their impact both when they were built and today. He is most well-known, perhaps, for his book, Black Confederates and Afro-Yankees in Civil War Virginia. He studies Virginia, as it had more African-Americans right before the Civil War than any other state. His work explains their significance in the Civil War and shaping the American consciousness. It covers both enslaved and free blacks as well as Confederate and Union black soldiers.  Affiliations  Jordan is a member of the Society of American Archivists, the Organization of American Historians, Phi Alpha Theta, the Association for the Study of African-American Life and History, and the Southern Historical Association. He is also a member for the State Historical Records Advisory Board, the Jamestown-Yorktown Board of Trustees, the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation 2019 Commemoration Steering Committee, and the President's Commission on Slavery and the University. In 2018, Jordan was selected to begin a three year term as a member of the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society Board of Directors. Jordan is also a member of the SAA's Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable. He is passionate about the importance of diversity in archives and explains in an interview with the SAA Newsletter, Archival Outlook: > ...though we like to think of the 21st century as one of ever-increasing > globalization and an increasingly culturally diverse society, as an African > American I‚Äôm concerned by the persistence of racism in the archival > workplace. I‚Äôve lectured on this subject at conferences and am a long- > standing member of SAA‚Äôs Archivists & Archives of Color Roundtable. We > should not just define diversity. We must practice and embrace it. Jordan has also appeared on episodes of television shows, including TLC's Who Do You Think You Are?, which aims to help celebrities explore their heritage and genealogy. He appeared in season two's episode on Lionel Richie as an archivist and researcher looking to explore Richie's family tree. Jordan also appeared in the PBS television documentary series, American Experience. He is titled as a historian in the 2011 episode on Robert E. Lee where he helps to explore the controversial figure's past. He has also been invited to speak at panels and events televised by C-SPAN, most which pertain to African American history, genealogy and Civil War and slavery topics.

Argued before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in September 2019, the case concerned whether the advice given by the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, to Queen Elizabeth II that Parliament should be prorogued in the prelude to the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union was lawful. On 24 September 2019, in a unanimous decision by eleven justices, the court found that the matter was justiciable, and that Johnson's advice was unlawful; this upheld the Inner House of the Court of Session ruling in Cherry and overturned the High Court of Justice ruling in Miller. As a result, the Order in Council permitting the prorogation was null and of no effect and Parliament had, in fact, not been prorogued. Facts Prorogation is a political process in which the Parliament of the United Kingdom is suspended after the closure of one parliamentary session until a State Opening of Parliament several days later. The suspension of Parliament has the effect of ending all parliamentary proceedings and any proposed legislation which does not pass prior to prorogation must be re-introduced in the next session of Parliament. Although typically a routine process, there have been several historical cases where prorogation has been controversial; most notably, the English Civil War was triggered amidst tensions between Charles I, who would only convene Parliament to pass controversial ship taxes, and Parliament, who sought more powers to scrutinise the King, going so far as to pass laws which prevented its own prorogation or dissolution. Eventually, Parliament went to war with and subsequently executed Charles I for the crime of tyranny; his successor as head of state, Oliver Cromwell, also had tensions with Parliament and eventually purged and expelled the \\"Long Parliament\\" in favour of another. Similar contemporary events in other Commonwealth countries that were highly controversial include the 2008 prorogation of the Parliament of Canada, which prevented the Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, from being voted out of office via a vote of no confidence; the 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis, in which the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that President Maithripala Sirisena's attempt to dissolve Parliament was unlawful and void; and \\"The Dismissal\\", in which the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed by the Governor-General, John Kerr, and Whitlam's successor, Malcolm Fraser, requested the double dissolution of Parliament in advance of a federal election before the Labor-controlled House of Representatives could reinstate Whitlam. After the 2017 general election, the government, led by Theresa May, announced that the first session of Parliament after the election would last until 2019‚Äînormally, parliamentary sessions last a year‚Äîto allow for greater parliamentary scrutiny of their Brexit plans. By May 2019, the session had become the longest to sit since the Long Parliament, some four centuries before. The government's preferred Brexit withdrawal agreement was rejected three times in early 2019, which deepened tensions between opposition politicians, the government, and advocates of a \\"no-deal Brexit\\"; Brexit was subsequently delayed until 31 October 2019, and May resigned her leadership of the Conservative Party. May was succeeded in the following party leadership election by Boris Johnson, whose campaign team had floated the possibility of prorogation to force a no-deal Brexit despite Parliament overwhelmingly rejecting the proposition. Further speculation that Parliament could be prorogued led opposition MPs to successfully amend the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Bill to make prorogation during late October functionally impossible by requiring the government to report to Parliament its efforts to restore the Northern Ireland Assembly, which Parliament would then sit‚Äîeven during prorogation‚Äîto debate. In late July, the newly appointed Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government viewed prorogation for political purposes as an \\"archaic mechanism\\" which would not be used. Despite this, Johnson still planned to have Parliament prorogued, and sought legal advice in mid-August from his Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox , to that effect. On 28 August 2019, Jacob Rees-Mogg, in the role of Lord President of the Council, convened a small Privy Council meeting with the Queen whilst she was in residence at Balmoral Castle. The Queen gave her consent to prorogation, to start between 9 and 12 September, and end with the State Opening of Parliament on 14 October. The prorogation ceremony in Parliament took place in the early hours of 10 September 2019 amidst tense scenes in the House of Commons‚Äîits Speaker, John Bercow, described such a long prorogation as an \\"act of executive fiat\\"‚Äîand opposition boycotts of the ceremony in the House of Lords. The announcement of prorogation led to two cases being immediately filed‚Äîone in England by Gina Miller and one in Northern Ireland by Raymond McCord‚Äîand for the applicants in a third case in Scotland headed by Joanna Cherry to request their case to be expedited. =Miller and McCord= Gina Miller, who previously defeated the government on the use of the royal prerogative in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, made an urgent application for judicial review of the use of prerogative powers at the High Court of Justice for England and Wales in London, and victims' rights activist Raymond McCord made an application at the High Court of Northern Ireland in Belfast which alleged breaches of the Good Friday Agreement. Miller's application was made in late August following the government announcing the prorogation. Both cases were rejected as non- justiciable: the High Court of Justice rejected Miller's case on 6 September; while the High Court of Northern Ireland did not address the aspects of McCord's case to do with prorogation in its judgment on 12 September since it was already the \\"centrepiece\\" of the English and Scottish cases. =Cherry= At the end of July 2019, a group of 78 parliamentarians, led by Scottish National Party (SNP) justice spokeswoman Joanna Cherry and barrister Jolyon Maugham , had made an application for judicial review to the Outer House of Scotland's highest court, the Court of Session in Edinburgh. The application was made to the court in Scotland because it sat during the summer‚Äîunlike its English counterpart‚Äîand was made in anticipation of a public u-turn on the matter from the government. The litigants sought a ruling that prorogation to avoid parliamentary scrutiny would be unconstitutional and unlawful. The government averred that the petition was \\"hypothetical and premature\\" and \\"that there was no reasonable or even hypothetical apprehension\\" that the government intended to advise that the Queen prorogue Parliament in order to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of its Brexit plans, and confirmed that averment on 23 August and 27 August. When prorogation was announced on 28 August, the Cherry hearing was expedited to the following week and the applicants made an application for an interim interdict; two days later, Lord Doherty refused the request as he was not satisfied there was a \\"cogent need\\" for one. During the Court of Session hearings on 3 September, the court heard evidence that Johnson had approved negotiations with the Palace on 15 August 2019, by way of signing a handwritten note to his special adviser Nikki da Costa and Dominic Cummings, and made comments about the short sitting of Parliament in September being a \\"rigmarole\\" to show MPs were \\"earning their crust\\". Aidan O'Neill , who represented the petitioners at the Court of Session, argued that this proved the government misled the court when they described the issue of prorogation as an academic one. On 4 September, Doherty ruled in the first instance that the matter was non-justiciable; the case was immediately appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. On 11 September, the three-judge appellate panel at the Court of Session, consisting of Lords Carloway (Lord President), Brodie, and Drummond Young, unanimously found the prorogation was unlawful. The court found Johnson was motivated by \\"improper purpose of stymieing Parliament\\" and had effectively \\"misled the Queen\\", and as a result, declared the royal proclamation as \\"null and of no effect\\", but did not offer a binding remedy to that effect. The three appeal judges of the Inner House of the Court of Session noted that O'Neill made \\"interesting and stirring\\" remarks about a Scottish tradition of holding the Crown to account; the judges stated O'Neill had \\"not actually identified any material differences between the applicable Scots law and the corresponding English law\\" and his argument was \\"pushing at an open door\\". =Hearing= Press and anti-prorogation protesters assemble outside the Supreme Court on 17 September 2019 To resolve the fundamental differences between the senior courts of England and Wales and Scotland, both the Miller and Cherry cases were appealed to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom; the former skipped the Court of Appeal as a \\"leapfrog appeal\\". The Supreme Court began a three- day emergency hearing to consider the appeals on 17 September 2019. Due to the significance of the case, the maximum eleven of the twelve Supreme Court justices sat to hear the appeal,The number of justices who sit on a Supreme Court case must be odd to prevent tied votes. with Lord Briggs not sitting to ensure an odd number of judges. The case was only the second case heard by eleven justices in the Supreme Court's history; the first was R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (2017), which delivered an 8‚Äì3 verdict that the royal prerogative could not be used to invoke Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The court allowed six interveners to make representations over the course of the hearing: Raymond McCord, whose case was not heard alongside Miller and Cherry; the Lord Advocate for Scotland, James Wolffe ; the Counsel General for Wales, Jeremy Miles ; former Prime Minister John Major; the Shadow Attorney General, Shami Chakrabarti; and The Public Law Project. The first day of the hearing heard representations from the challengers of each lower court case. The Advocate General for Scotland, Lord Keen, argued that the government was entitled to prorogue Parliament for political purposes, as Clement Attlee did in 1948 when he called a short pro forma session of Parliament to hasten the passage of the Parliament Act 1949, and that Parliament had adequate recourse to prevent prorogation if it did not wish to be prorogued. He also argued that in declaring the prorogation void, the Court of Session ruled outside its jurisdiction. When asked by the court whether Johnson would prorogue Parliament for a second time, Keen did not answer. Lord Pannick , who responded on Miller's behalf, argued that there was \\"strong evidence\\" that the purpose of prorogation was to prevent MPs from \\"frustrating\\" the government's Brexit plans, and that the court was entitled and obligated to deliver verdicts on the rule of law. The second day heard from the victors in each lower court case; the government, represented by James Eadie , argued that prorogation was \\"a well-established constitutional function exercised by the executive\\" and that decisions about prorogation were matters of \\"high policy\\". Eadie argued that in the absence of legislation that regulated the power of prorogation, it was not appropriate for the judiciary to \\"design a set of rules\\" to judge prorogation by; when asked by the justices how prorogation was compatible with parliamentary sovereignty, he answered that prorogation always had the effect of temporarily suspending parliamentary scrutiny, and parliamentarians could continue scrutinising the government once Parliament resumed. Eadie was also questioned why there was no signed witness statement that testified to the reasons for prorogation. O'Neill, who represented the Cherry litigants, argued that the decision to prorogue was \\"taken in bad faith\\" and \\"for an improper purpose\\" and that the Court of Session opinion offered an outsider perspective \\"400 miles from Westminster\\" to that effect. O'Neill agreed with Eadie that it would not be appropriate for the Court to create such rules, but argued that it was nevertheless \\"the province of the courts\\" to decide whether prorogation was constitutional. The final day of the hearing saw interventions from other interested parties: Major's former Solicitor General, Lord Garnier, argued prorogation was \\"motivated by a desire to prevent Parliament interfering with the Prime Minister's policies during that period\\"; the Scottish Government, who were represented by the Lord Advocate, argued prorogation had a \\"profoundly intrusive effect\\" on Parliament; McCord's advocate Ronan Lavery argued prorogation was designed to \\"run down the clock\\" to force a no-deal Brexit, which would in turn result in controls on the border with Ireland; and in a written submission, the Shadow Attorney General, Shami Chakrabarti, said that if the power to prorogue was unchecked, Parliament would be \\"deprived\\" of the ability to \\"perform its constitutional function\\". The hearing ended with the government and the petitioners summing up their arguments: Keen re-iterated the argument that the courts were constitutionally \\"not properly equipped\\" to decide on matters of high policy; and Pannick requested the court make a declaration that prorogation was unlawful and for Parliament to be recalled as a result. Judgment On 24 September, the eleven-justice panel of the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the prerogative power of prorogation was justiciable and the ongoing prorogation of Parliament was both unlawful and void. The court utilised a three-prong test in determining the case: * Was the matter justiciable? Relying on the High Court of Justice ruling in the 1611 Case of Proclamations that \\"the King hath no prerogative but that which the law of the land allows him\\", the court found that it was. The court also found that the use of the prerogative power of prorogation is a use of the royal prerogative that was open to judicial review, as no party in the case argued that the court did not have the jurisdiction to rule on the existence or limits of the power of prorogation. * What are the limits to the power of prorogation? In ruling on this question, the court relied on the constitutional conventions of parliamentary sovereignty and democratic accountability. If the power of prorogation was unchecked, then the executive could indefinitely prorogue Parliament, undermining its sovereignty and obligation to make and scrutinise laws. The court quoted Lord Bingham's statement that the government's conduct being accountable to Parliament \\"lies at the heart of Westminster democracy\\", and the power of prorogation was limited by that principle. Hence, the court ruled that any prorogation would be unlawful \\"if it has the effect of frustrating or preventing, without reasonable justification, the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions as a legislature and as the body responsible for the supervision of the executive\\", and if that was the case, there would be no need to rule on whether the motives of the executive were lawful. * Did prorogation frustrate the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions? The court ruled that the prorogation of Parliament did have this effect. In particular, the court found that with the backdrop of the \\"fundamental [constitutional] change\\" of Brexit, as the elected representatives of the people, the House of Commons in particular had the right to scrutinise any Brexit plans from the government. Proroguing for five out of the eight weeks leading up to 31 October prevented Parliament from exercising its constitutional functions, which had an \\"extreme\\" effect on \\"the fundamentals of democracy\\". The court found that the government had not provided a justification for such a prorogation; the government had only provided the Nikki da Costa memorandum as evidence, which only justified a State Opening on 14 October, not the date of prorogation. The court also found that the government offered no justification for a five-week prorogation when the normal period of preparation for a State Opening was four to six days, and that the da Costa memorandum did not take into account how the necessary scrutiny of any withdrawal agreement under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 could be scheduled. As a result, the court was \\"bound to conclude\\" that the advice to prorogue was unlawful because it frustrated Parliament's constitutional functions. The court disagreed with the government's assertion that prorogation could not be questioned under the Bill of Rights 1689 as a \\"proceeding of Parliament\\"; it ruled that the opposite assertion‚Äîthat prorogation is imposed upon and thus not debatable by Parliament, and brings parliamentary activity protected under the Bill of Rights to an end‚Äîwas the correct interpretation of the law. Consequently, the Court agreed with the Inner House of the Court of Session that the resulting prorogation was null and of no effect and quashed the relevant Order in Council, which meant the effect of the royal proclamation of prorogation had the legal effect of \\"a blank piece of paper\\". As a result, the court ruled that \\"Parliament has not been prorogued\\", and reverted the 2017‚Äì2019 parliament into being in session. Significance The judgment is significant for its treatment of the principle of justiciability, its interpretation of elements of the British constitution, and its potential implications for the separation of powers. In a Financial Times article published the day after the judgment, Catherine Barnard, a professor of European law at the University of Cambridge, called it \\"a judgment of huge importance with major implications for our system of government\\" in which the court set down a ruling to stop constitutional players \\"who don't play by the rules\\". Constitutional historian Vernon Bogdanor, professor at King's College, London said that the judgment reaffirmed parliamentary sovereignty. Cambridge professor Mark Elliott, former legal adviser to the House of Lords' Constitution Committee, described the judgment as both \\"an orthodox application of constitutional principle\\" and a legal landmark for transforming the principle of parliamentary sovereignty into \\"hard and novel limits on executive authority\\". By contrast, Richard Ekins, an associate professor of law at the University of Oxford, called it \\"a startling judgment\\" that was \\"badly mistaken\\" and that the court showed \\"a clear loss of faith in the political process\\" when it ruled in an area that he and many other lawyers previously thought it did not have jurisdiction to do so. In the same vein, John Finnis, professor emeritus of law and legal philosophy at the University of Oxford, considered that the Supreme Court had \\"forayed\\" into politics, calling the judgment \\"a historic mistake\\" and \\"a misuse of judicial power\\". According to Finnis, prorogation is ruled by conventions, not by justiciable law, therefore the matters of prorogation have to be dealt with by Parliament itself and the court has no say in them. Richard Ekins, the Head of Policy Exchange's Judicial Power Project and a Professor of Law in the University of Oxford, without commenting on whether the procedure of prorogation should be reformed, argued that the ruling constituted lasting constitutional damage and violated Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689: \\"The Court's intervention is likely to do lasting damage to the political constitution and was neither justified nor permitted by the law that it was the Court's duty to uphold.\\" The speakers of both the House of Lords and House of Commons stated the ruling had quashed royal assent of the Parliamentary Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act 2019‚Äîwhich had royal assent signified during the prorogation ceremony‚Äîand therefore royal assent had to be re-signified. Yuan Yi Zhu, a Stipendiary Lecturer in Politics at Pembroke College, Oxford, argued that this was a misunderstanding by parliamentary authorities due to ambiguity in the judgment, ironically implicating the sovereignty of Parliament contrary to Article IX of the Bill of Rights 1689 and the enrolled bill rule; Zhu suggested a short bill should be passed to \\"reassert Parliamentary sovereignty and minimise the risk of its erosion\\" by the judiciary. In evidence to the House of Lords Constitution Committee, Junade Ali‚Äîeditor of A Federal Constitution for a Federal Britain, in which former Labour MP Graham Allen and high-profile republican campaigner Stephen Haseler argued for codification of prerogative powers‚Äîargued that as a result of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, the executive was unable to dissolve Parliament and thus resorted to prorogation. He noted there was an apparent misconception about the composition of Parliament: \\"It is fundamental within the precepts of the principles of Parliamentary Sovereignty that a chamber of the legislature is not sovereign, it is instead the Queen-in- Parliament which is sovereign.\\" Ali reiterated an argument he made before the judgment in the Oxford University Political Blog that in lieu of dissolution and prorogation, future prime ministers may ask the sovereign to refuse royal assent to any bill until the House of Commons agreed to call an early general election, which he argued would likely cause far greater public outrage than prorogation. Ali invoked an A. V. Dicey argument that‚Äîwhere Parliament is sovereign‚Äîdissolution is necessary both for security and harmony between the government and Parliament, and concluded that: \\"Paradoxically, in its quest to control its own destiny, the House of Commons might achieve the opposite.\\" Robert Blackburn, a Professor of Constitutional Law, King‚Äôs College London, argued in a different submission to the same committee that repeal or reform of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 would potentially provide a convenient opportunity for prorogation to become subject to a vote in both Houses of Parliament on a motion moved by the government ‚Äì but did not consider the potential impact on the prerogative power of royal assent. Robert Craig of the University of Bristol also argued that powers in the British constitution are fused, and that \\"the FtPA has upset this delicate balance\\". Craig argued the Act should accordingly be repealed and replaced, and argued against legislation to make norms in the parliamentary system more rigid by comparing such attempts to \\"trying to pop a balloon half way.\\" The Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 received royal assent on 31 October 2019 in order to sidestep the need for a two-thirds majority for an early parliamentary general election. In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the Conservative party won an overall majority. The Conservative election manifesto contained a pledge to reform judicial review such that it \\"is not abused to conduct politics by another means\\". The Queen's Speech after the election also announced the government's intention to uphold their manifesto commitment to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. =Political reaction= In a statement delivered in person to journalists on College Green‚Äînear Parliament and the Supreme Court's seat in the Middlesex Guildhall‚ÄîCommons Speaker John Bercow announced that Parliament would sit on the following day from . Prime Minister's Questions was not scheduled for its regular Wednesday midday slot, but Bercow said he would allow urgent questions and applications for emergency debates to be heard. Boris Johnson, who was in New York City to give a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, brought forward his speech from the morning of 25 September to the evening of 24 September to allow him to fly back to Britain in time for the parliamentary sitting. Johnson said that he \\"strongly disagreed\\" with the ruling, but the government would \\"respect the judicial process\\" and not prevent Parliament from meeting; he also stated his preference for a new parliamentary session and Queen's Speech after a lawful prorogation. After the ruling, Johnson was criticised by opposition leaders: Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn brought forward his conference keynote speech and invited Johnson to \\"consider his position and become the shortest-serving Prime Minister there‚Äôs ever been\\"; SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon demanded Johnson's resignation and urged Parliament to table a motion of no confidence if he did not resign; Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said that Johnson was not \\"fit to be Prime Minister\\"; and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called prorogation \\"the worst political decision ever\\" and called on Johnson to fire his adviser Dominic Cummings for suggesting the plan. The first item of debate in Parliament was an urgent question by Cherry to the Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox. Cherry urged Cox to publish the legal advice he gave to Johnson on the subject of prorogation to avoid him being labelled as a scapegoat for the affair; Cox replied that he would consider whether its publication would be in the public interest. He defended the advice he gave to Johnson on the constitutionality of the prorogation as being \\"in good faith\\", and that other senior legal professionals and lower courts agreed with the government's arguments. Cox also repeated Johnson's statement from the previous day that the government accepted the ruling, and rebuked comments which attacked the independence of the judiciary; in particular, he disagreed with Jacob Rees- Mogg's description of the judgment as a \\"constitutional coup\\" and said that the motives of the judiciary were not to be questioned.

The party is led by Matteo Renzi, a former Prime Minister of Italy and former secretary of the Democratic Party (PD).  History  = Background = Matteo Renzi, a devout Catholic, a former scout leader of AGESCI and a centrist, started his political career in the Italian People's Party (PPI), a Christian-democratic outfit, and was elected president of the Province of Florence in 2004. Through Democracy is Freedom ‚Äì The Daisy party he joined the Democratic Party in 2007 and was elected Mayor of Florence in 2009. A frequent critic of his party's leadership, especially under Pier Luigi Bersani, Renzi made his name as il Rottamatore, in English the Scrapper or the Demolisher (of old leaders and ideas), for his advocacy of complete change in the party, as well as a reformer and a modernizer. His followers were known as Renziani. Speculations over a new party led by Renzi date back to 2012, when he was defeated by Bersani in the run-off of the centre-left primary election. Rumors stopped when Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in December 2013. He also became Prime Minister in February 2014. He led the party to huge electoral success in the 2014 European Parliament election (40.8%), but badly lost the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum (59.1% to 40.9%), which caused his resignation as Prime Minister. After the PD's defeat in the 2018 general election, in which the PD only gained 18.7% of vote, forcing Renzi to resign as secretary, rumours came back. In March 2019 Nicola Zingaretti, a social democrat and a prominent member of the party's left-wing, with solid roots in the Italian Communist Party, won the leadership election by a landslide, defeating Maurizio Martina (Renzi's former deputy secretary) and Roberto Giachetti (supported by most Renziani). Zingaretti focused his campaign on a clear contrast with Renzi's policies and, according to pundits, his victory opened the way for a new party. In August 2019, tensions grew within the coalition supporting the Giuseppe Conte's first government, leading to the issuing of a motion of no-confidence by the League. Despite having opposed it in the past, Renzi advocated the formation of a new government between the PD and the populist Five Star Movement (M5S). After days of tensions within the PD, on 28 August, Zingaretti announced his support for a new government with the M5S, led by Conte.Conte wins crucial support for likely new Italian coalition The Conte II Cabinet was sworn in on 5 September, and Renzi was seen by many as the real kingmaker of the new parliamentary majority. = Foundation = On 16 September, in an interview to la Repubblica, Renzi announced his intention to leave the PD, and create new parliamentary groups. On the same day, interviewed by Bruno Vespa during the late-night TV talk-show Porta a Porta, he officially launched Italia Viva. In the interview he confirmed also the support to Conte's government. Renzi was initially followed by 24 deputies and 12 senators from the PD, notably including Maria Elena Boschi, Roberto Giachetti, Teresa Bellanova (Minister of Agriculture) and Elena Bonetti (Minister of Family and Equal Opportunities). Three more senators, Donatella Conzatti, Riccardo Nencini and Gelsomina Vono, joined respectively from Forza Italia (FI), Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and M5S, while one deputy, Gabriele Toccafondi, joined from Popular Civic List (CP). The split was condemned by the PD's leadership: Zingaretti described it as a \\"mistake\\", while Dario Franceschini called it a \\"big problem\\". Beppe Grillo, founder of the M5S, described Renzi's actions as \\"an act of narcissism\\". Prime Minister Conte declared his perplexity too, saying that Renzi \\"should have informed [him] before the birth of the government\\". Additionally, Il Foglio revealed that internet domains italiaviva.eu and italiaviva.org were created on 9 August 2019, hinting that the split had been prepared in advance. The following day la Repubblica revealed that the domains were bought by Alessandro Risso, a former member of Christian Democracy and the PPI from Piedmont. However, Risso explained that his moves had nothing to do with Renzi, whom he opposed. Italia Viva's backbone was largely based on the Committees of Civil Action of Back to the Future, launched by Renzi during the 2018 Leopolda convention in Florence and seen by some people as the initial step of a new party. Ettore Rosato, the organizer of the committees, and Bellanova were appointed party's coordinators. In October, during the Leopolda annual convention, the logo of IV was unveiled. It featured a stylized seagull and was chosen by supporters in an online vote. In February, Nicola Danti, IV member and MEP, left the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats group and joined the Renew Europe group. A few days before, Sandro Gozi, a former member of the PD's national board who had later joined IV, was sworn in as member of the European Parliament for France (elected with Renaissance list, formed largely by members of La R√©publique En Marche) and became the party's second MEP.  Ideology  Italia Viva is considered a liberal and reformist party. Its \\"Charter of Values\\", presented in October 2019, referred to republican and anti-fascist values expressed in the Constitution of Italy, as well as in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The movement also emphasized the principle of gender equality, the relaunch of globalization and a strong opposition to all forms of protectionism and souverainism. It also supported a more incisive European political and economic integration, with the direct election of the President of the European Commission and the introduction of transnational lists. Renzi described his movement as a \\"young, innovative and feminist house, where new ideas for Italy and Europe are launched.\\"Una nuova casa. Innovativa, giovane e femminista. As often stressed by Renzi himself, Italia Viva has been compared to Emmanuel Macron's La R√©publique En Marche! (REM).

Three other by- elections were held on the same day, in Dublin Fingal, Dublin Mid-West, and Wexford. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 204 stipulates that a by-election in Ireland must be held within six months of a vacancy occurring. The by-election writ was moved in the D√°il on 7 November 2019. At the 2016 general election, the electorate of Cork North-Central was 81,609, and the constituency elected one Fianna F√°il TD, one AAA‚ÄìPBP TD, one Sinn F√©in TD, and one Fine Gael TD. The 2019 electorate was 85,524 (a 4.8% increase). Among the by-election candidates were Senator and former MEP Colm Burke; four Cork City Councillors (Thomas Gould, John Maher, Oliver Moran and Fiona Ryan); Cork County Councillor P√°draig O'Sullivan; and three unsuccessful candidates at the May 2019 city council election (Sin√©ad Halpin. Thomas Kiely, and Finian Toomey). This was the first occasion Aont√∫ (also contested Wexford) and the Social Democrats (also contested Dublin Fingal and Dublin Mid-West) contested by- elections. In mid-November it was reported that Fine Gael's Dara Murphy would be resigning his seat in the same constituency in December, to become deputy chef de cabinet of European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel. The Irish Times reported regret within Fine Gael that Murphy had not resigned sooner, which would have allowed one single transferable vote by-election to fill both vacancies, increasing the likelihood that Fine Gael would have retained a seat. Result The number of votes to qualify for reimbursement of election expenses was 3,179 (one-quarter of the quota), which was reached by O'Sullivan, Burke, Gould, and Maher.

Demands by workers included increased job security, gateway for temporary workers to become permanent, better pay and retaining healthcare benefits. Background This strike constituted the first major labor action in the American automotive industry in a decade. The last strike coordinated by the UAW targeting General Motors occurred in 2007. =Motivations= During the Great Recession and economic uncertainty that followed, unionized automotive workers accepted concessions to allow GM and other companies to recover. Though GM has since received large tax breaks and returned to profitability, worker compensation remained stagnant, and the UAW took umbrage with the company's decisions to shutter American facilities and move some jobs abroad. Strike The contract between the UAW and General Motors expired September 14, and the strike began at 11:59pm on Sunday, September 15, 2019. A two day difference between contract expiration and the beginning of a strike is unusually short, but likely motivated by the prolonged negotiations between management and the union. The strike involved 48,000 GM employees. On September 17, GM stopped providing health insurance to 55,000 union members, forcing the UAW to pay for COBRA. On September 26, it was announced that GM would start to pay health insurance again to people on strike.https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gm-strike-update-company-will-now-cover- health-care-for-striking-workers/ On October 16, It was announced that GM and The UAW agreed on a new labor contract that could end a month-long strike by 48,000 workers. Although the agreement between GM and UAW has not been officially approved, and workers who are still on strike said that they will wait until the deal has been approved completely before they return to their jobs.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/gm-uaw-agree-on-tentative-labor-contract- that-could-end-strike.html The new contract was ratified by UAW members on October 25, ending the strike Impact An analyst for Credit Suisse estimated GM could lose as much as $50 million each day the strike continues, while other analysts estimated daily losses could be as high as $100 million per day. GM's share of the automobile market has decreased from 30% in the late 1990s to 17% today, meaning the strike will likely have fewer implications for the economy at large when compared to labor actions in the past. The strike was also predicted to possibly lead to impacts on GM factories abroad, which rely on parts produced in American factories closed due to the strike, and on suppliers such as Canada-based Magna International. At the beginning of the strike, GM had roughly 83 days' worth of inventory available for sale, temporarily insulating its supply chain from the impact of the strike. =Reactions= Teamsters have refused to deliver GM cars during the strike, in solidarity with GM workers. Members of the Trump administration, including Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro allegedly intervened in negotiations. GM and the White House have both denied Kudlow and Navarro's involvement. On Saturday September 21, Senator Elizabeth Warren, running at the time for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, joined a UAW picket line in Detroit. Other Democratic contenders for the nomination including Senator Bernie Sanders, former vice-president Joe Biden, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Tim Ryan, also visited picket lines during the strike.

A lasting example of his work is the model cast in bronze of HMS Buffalo atop the Centenary memorial, Moseley Square, Glenelg, in South Australia. He was referred to as \\"Dalton‚ÄìHall\\" in his death notices, but rarely elsewhere; he signed his paintings \\"H. D. Hall\\". History Hall was born in Semaphore, South Australia, second surviving son of clerk Charles James Hall and his wife Susannah Maria Hall, n√©e Dalton (died 11 July 1909), who married in 1872. They had thirteen or fourteen children, but around half died young. Hall's father was proved insolvent in 1892 and died before 1909, but further details are yet to emerge. Sylvia was related to the English parliamentarian Hugh Dalton, and his father Rev. John Neale Dalton, Canon of Windsor and Domestic Chaplain to the King. Her father was Adelaide chemist Charles Dalton, for many years with F. H. Faulding. Hall grew up in Queenstown, South Australia By 1894 he was working on the South Australian Navy ship Protector as a cabin boy. He joined the Royal Navy, and did the gunnery course at HMS Excellent and was trained on torpedoes at HMS Vernon, both shore establishments. He underwent further training aboard HMS Victory, which from 1889 to 1904 served as a base for the Naval School of Telegraphy. This was prior to practical wireless telegraphy, semaphore and Morse code using signal lamps being then the principal means of ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication. He served on repairing ship HMS Assistance, where he was in charge, with two other people, of the dynamos. He was in charge of torpedoes on HMS Powerful under Capt. Dudley North, and it was from this ship that he took his discharge. He retired from the Navy around 1909 after twelve years of service, and returned to Adelaide. He took lessons in painting from James Ashton, and 1918‚Äì1920 was an active member of \\"The Art Club\\", whose members included Ierne Acraman, Olive Atkinson, Ethel Barringer, D'A. Boxall, Albert Collins, May Grigg, Ruby Henty, L. H. Howie, Marie Tuck and Maud Wynes, but was largely self-taught. He had a senior position with the GPO (predecessor of the PMG) as electrician in charge of the Glenelg telephone exchange, and painted mostly on weekends. Centenary monument, west face He painted, in oils and other media, ships from the original Australian colonies' navies to more modern vessels. Examples of his work were in the collections of the Prince of Wales, Lord Jellicoe, Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey; others were on sale to the public through an art dealer. One large oil painting, of the 1st AIF convoy 1914, hung in the RSL clubhouse, Glenelg. He constructed a large detailed model of HMS Victory which employed almost a mile of twine for the cordage, 200 blocks and 500 eye splices; it was a feature of the naval procession held in Adelaide on 25 October 1918. In 1916 he made another model of HMS Victory, which was purchased by the firm of W.D. & H.O. Wills to present to the Navy League, and was exhibited at Royal Naval House in Sydney. In 1936, as part of the Centenary of South Australia celebrations, Hall conducted a Buffalo model boat building competition open to adults and children. He gave a great deal of assistance to competitors, in an effort to secure serious effort on their part. His own contribution, floating on the sea near the Patawalonga River, is illustrated here. He had earlier built the wooden pattern from which the bronze Buffalo for the monument was cast. In 1943 Hall was transferred to the GPO telephone workshops at Sydenham, New South Wales. He died in hospital at Liverpool, New South Wales on 1 August 1946, and was buried 3 August in Rookwood Cemetery. Vernon died at Gloucester House on 31 August 1955. Sylvia was at the Rockdale address in 1951, and resided there until her death in hospital on 2 August 1968. Recognition Hall was awarded a gold medal by the Glenelg Council for his contribution to the Australia Day procession of 26 July 1918. Family Siblings who survived to adulthood were Caroline Elizabeth Hall (1873‚Äì1953) married Howsin Spafford in 1913; Gerald Percy \\"Perce\\" Hall (1878‚Äì1967), Rupert Charles Hall (1884‚Äì1938), Violet May \\"Lettie\\" (1888‚Äì1969) and Dora Gertrude Hall (1890‚Äì1950). Harold Dalton Hall married Sylvia Muriel Rubena Schrader (1891‚Äì2 August 1968) on 22 February 1914. They had one son, Vernon Dalton Hall (12 September 1916 ‚Äì 31 August 1955), and lived at Second Avenue, Helmsdale (now Glenelg East) until his transfer to Sydney, then had a house at 33 Bryant Street, Rockdale, New South Wales.

Facilities and aircraft  Morris Municipal Airport - Charlie Schmidt Field covers 163 acres encompassing two runways. Runway 14/32 serves as the main runway with an asphalt surface measuring 4,002 by 75 feet. Runway 4/22 is turf and serves as the crosswind runway measuring 2,637 by 145 feet. The turf runway at MOX is closed during the winter. The airport features an arrival and departure building built in 1990 for general aviation and several hangars. In addition to recreational use, the airport is used by corporate air taxi flights, aerial agriculture spraying planes, and daily United Parcel Service cargo feeder flights from Fargo, North Dakota. The cargo flights are operated by Bemidji Airlines. In 2017, the airport had 5,906 aircraft operations with 19 aircraft based at the field.  History  The airport was build under a Works Progress Administration grant in 1940. The airport opened in 1942 with four turf runways ranging in length from 1700 to 3400 feet long. The newly opened airport hosted a Civilian Pilot Training Program during World War II. In the early 1960s the east-west turf runway was closed, and the north-south turf runway was closed in the early 1980s. In 1961 State and Federal funding was used to grade a new Runway 14-32, and regrade the north- south runway. In 1965 State and Federal funding was used to pave runway 14-32 at 3000 feet by 75 feet and to install runway lighting. In 1984 Runway 14-32 was reconstructed and lengthened to 3400 feet.

Although the Senate approved an unamended version on March 22, 1972, attempts at ratification of the amendment in the state of Utah repeatedly failed. Organizations formed and took positions on both sides of the issue, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was one of the major opponents of the ERA. The Church organized women and other church members in opposition, while also networking with other anti-ERA organizations. The Utah Legislature officially voted down the amendment in 1975. However, Utah still houses a wide variety of organized groups and opinions for and against the Equal Rights Amendment, which remains unratified to the present.Map of ERA ratification per state up to May 2018. Red: States that ratified. Orange: States that ratified, then rescinded. Green: States that ratified in one house of legislature. Blue: Not ratified.  ERA in the United States  Originally written by Alice Paul and introduced to U.S. Congress in 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was finally passed in 1972. It was then up to thirty-eight states to ratify the amendment within the next seven years. As explained by Kimberly Voss, a Professor at the Nicholson School of Communication at the University of Central Florida, the ERA could be broken down into three parts: ‚ÄúSection 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of the article. Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.‚Äù Nationwide, there were coalitions in support of the amendment and against it. While some looked to the ERA as a means to legal equality, which would provide equal economic and academic access, more conservative groups grew wary of the amendment as it could potentially strip away protections that women had under the law. Some arguments against the ERA included the right women had to be exempt from the military draft, anti-unisex bathrooms, and opposition to homosexual marriage.  Anti-ERA Coalitions in Utah  = The Eagle Forum and Phyllis Schlafly = The nationally involved anti-ERA leader Phyllis Schlafly was also directly involved in the movement against the ERA in Utah. Schlafly organized the National Committee to Stop ERA in 1972, and in 1975 the group became the Eagle Forum. The Eagle Forum became a popular network for anti-ERA women in Utah. Phyllis Schlafly continued to exercise influence among women in Utah. One woman stated that in the International Women's Year convention in Salt Lake City that many attendees carried Phyllis Schlafly material as they voted in opposition to the ERA. Along with the Eagle Forum, other groups also organized in opposition to the ERA, including Humanitarians Opposed to Degrading Our Girls (HOTDOG).alt=Phyllis Schafly Helped in the establishment of the Eagle Forum within Utah politics. = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints = While the Equal Rights Amendment was going through construction and revision during the 1960s and early 1970s, the LDS Church made little to no response. When the House of Representatives passed the bill in 1971, LDS Congressmen responded differently from each other, generally following their party lines. However, as the ERA moved to the states for ratification, the LDS Church began making statements in opposition to the amendment. In the Ensign in 1971, the President of the Church, Joseph Fielding Smith, made a statement focused on the role of women in society and in the home. He warned that growing media sent messages aimed at tearing down the calling of mothers, which God had ordained. At the general conference of the Church in April 1971, H. Burke Peterson from the Presiding Bishopric stated that the involvement of women in employment would lead to neglect in the family and a focus on worldly gain. N. Eldon Tanner further strengthened the connection between the temptations of Satan and the liberality of women in the October 1973 general conference. LDS Salt Lake Temple. Located at Church headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Relief Society, a women's organization in the church, also continued to spread this anti-ERA message through informal lessons. However, the Relief Society played a more organized part in these politics when the Special Affairs Committee of the LDS Church enlisted Relief Society leaders to work directly in opposition to the amendment. This brought women in Utah directly into the political sphere and made them a central force in the defeat of the ERA. The Church further established their position by a series of more official statements beginning in 1975 with a Church News editorial. The editorial clarified the separate roles of men and women and claimed that the ERA was unnecessary. While support for the ERA in Utah had initially been about sixty-three percent in November 1974, the official statement from the Church in 1975 led to a drop in support to thirty-one percent in February 1975.  Organization of LDS Women  As the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints increasingly viewed the fight against the ERA as a broader fight against second-wave feminism, the International Women's Year (IWY) state conference provided the opportunity for Mormon women to mobilize against the feminist movement. Hoping to overwhelm the conference and provide the opinions of many conservative minded women, the church communicated that each ward in the state should send ten conservative women to the conference. The total population for the state conference resulted in 13,867 women. Coordinated with the help of men on walkie-talkies, these women voted down any proposal without discussion, even some proposals that their goals could have supported. This same process occurred in other states where LDS women resided. Through these efforts to overwhelm the IWY, and other pushes to fight the ratification of the ERA, the Church became a staunch opponent to the passing of the ERA in Utah, and also on a national scale.  Pro-ERA Coalitions in Utah  Following the example of the President's Commission on the Status of Women, the Governor's Commission on the Status of Women in Utah was organized by Governor Clyde in 1964. While the President's Commission on the Status of Women had initially discreetly formed against the ERA, as members worried that the legislation would threaten protections over working women, Utah's all-women committee focused on general women's issues. They also compiled and issued reports concerning discrimination against women. The committee later worked to persuade the Utah legislature to ratify the ERA, while committee members made and distributed pro-ERA pamphlets. A more conservative pro-ERA coalition was the National Organization for Women (NOW), which was organized by Betty Friedan in 1966. Members of NOW focused on public opinion as they lobbied for political reform. NOW was also one of the groups that picketed the IWY Convention in opposition to LDS church interference. Other pro-ERA organizations at the convention included the Order of Women Legislators, Women's Democratic Club, Equal Rights Coalition of Utah, League of Women Voters, Equal Rights Legal Fund, Utah Welfare Rights Organization, and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Some of Utah's universities instituted programs focused on women's studies during this period. One faculty member at Utah State University described this event, stating that despite the university's conservative background and relationship with the LDS church, by 1976‚Äì77 around 280 individuals were enrolled in women's studies courses at USU. These university courses were influential in educating on women's rights and the current ERA issues. = Pro-ERA LDS Coalitions = Another group created in favor of passing the ERA in Utah was Mormons for ERA. Founded in 1978, with Sonia Johnson as the first elected president and spokesperson, this group lobbied, created forums which hosted public debates for the ERA, and worked on public relations that gave attention to related issues. Created when just three more states were needed for the ratification of the ERA, Mormons for ERA worked hard within the state of Utah, and Sonia Johnson was even called before the Utah legislation to argue for the amendment. In 1979, when Sonia Johnson was eventually excommunicated from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Mormons for ERA received much more national attention. After the failure of the ratification of the ERA, Mormons for ERA lost followers and contributors and drastically decreased in size. However, the organization still exists today after being revived in 2015.  Modern Implications  Once the ratification deadline ended in 1982 some still remained hopeful for a future revival of the ERA. Since the 1982 deadline, Illinois and Nevada have both ratified the ERA, leaving the nation one state short from the initial ratification requirements. In the 2019 elections, Virginia elected a majority democratic state congress, and many proponents of the ERA view Virginia as possibly becoming the thirty-eighth state needed to ratify what could become the 28th Amendment to the US Constitution. While thirty-seven states have ratified the amendment, the five states of Nebraska, Tennessee, Kentucky, Idaho, and South Dakota have each since repealed their ratification. What remains in question is how the constitutional conversation around the ERA may proceed if thirty-eight states achieve ratification at some point in their history. Modern pro-ERA advocates are excited about the possibility of Utah being the last state needed to legally ratify the ERA. Women such as Kate Kelly, Sara Vranes, and Anissa Rasheta are heavily involved with the Utah Mormons for ERA movement, working on the same initiatives as the organization that was established in 1978. In the past decade, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has remained neutral about ratification of the ERA in Utah.

Pseudothielavia terricola is widely distributed, especially in the tropical region of the world - with documented appearances in Africa, Southern Europe, and Asia. The species is mainly found in soil, but can also be found on other materials such as animal dung.. The species was first assigned to the genus Coniothyrium in 1927, but was soon re- assigned to the genus Thielavia which endured for almost 90 years. Recently, through intensive phylogenetic research and reassessment, the species was designated to a brand new genus, Pseudothielavia; The etymology of Pseudothielavia means similar to the genus Thielavia - the high resemblance was what contributed to the species assignment to the genus Thielavia 9 decades ago. The fungus is mesophilic, grows abundantly in a pH level between 3.9-6, and is able to utilize multiple carbohydrates to support its growth. Mature Pseudothielavia terricola colonies in culture is dark brown in colour and spread out. Pseudothielavia terricola synthesizes a variety of compounds, two of which are Thielavin A & B. Thielavin A & B were determined to be strong inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis which subsequently boasts the species' clinical research value in prostaglandin dysregulation. History and taxonomy The present species was first isolated in culture and described by J.C.Gilman and E.V.Abbott of the Department of Dermatology of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University from soil in 192.7. The isolated culture was kept at the Dermatology department of the university under the label Coniothyrium terricola Gilman and Abbott, No. 172.2 The soil sample of which the fungi was isolated came from the American Type Culture Collection; With soil obtained from Iowa, USA. The species - first designated in the genus Coniothyrium - was soon determined to belong to the genus Thielavia by in 1930; When the crushed culture mounts of the species was shown to Dr. B.O.Dodge of the New York Botanical Garden - which recognized the fungi as a species he isolated long time ago under the label 'Thielavia n.sp.' Emmons took the culture of Dr.Dodge, germinated the ascospores in new media, and compared it to culture no.1722; The two cultures displayed identical growth and morphological features - which contributed to the species' assignment of the genus Thielavia in 1930. In 2019, a new study was published by Xincun Wang and his team at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute which phylogenetically reassesed all members of the genus Thielavia through genetic sequencing. In the newly published study, the fungus Thielavia terricola was reassigned a new genus - Pseudothielavia. Currently, the name Pseudothielavia terricola holds the binomial authority of the fungi, while Coniothyrium terricola as well as Thielavia terricola are now considered as holotypes or synonyms of the species. The genus Coniothyrium and Thielavia may have been assigned to Pseudothielavia terricola due to similar defining characteristics that highly resmbles the fungi. Coniothyrium in the broad sense. is defined to be unicellular, smooth thin cell wall, pale-brown conidium, and a pycnidia structure with globose cavity. Thielavia, on the other hand, is defined to have a non-ostiolate, glabose, setose ascomata, a brown thin cell wall, ellipsoidal to clavate asci, and unicellular, brown, single-germ pored ascospores As will be demonstrated in the subsequent Growth and morphology section, defining characteristics of Coniothyrium coincides partially with Pseudothielavia terricola while defining characteristics of Thielavia fits Pseudothielavia terricola almost perfectly. However, following the recent phylogenetic re-assessment of the genus Thielavia, Wang and his team discovered that, Pseudothielavia terricola, although morphologically similar to the genus thielavia, should not be assigned to Thielavia sensu stricto due to genetic and subtle morphological differences. Thus, Wang and his team assigned a new genus - Pseudothielavia (Mycobank: MB829872)- to species that closely resembles the genus Thielavia but is genetically and morphologically distinct from the genus, which includes Pseudothielavia terricola Growth and morphology Pseudothielavia terricola is a mesophilic fungus, with an optimal growth temperature of 37¬∞C, a minimum growing temperature of 15¬∞C and a highest of 46¬∞C. Acidity and basicity also contribute greatly to the proper growth of the species, the fungi grows most well in a pH range between 3.9 - 6, and terminates growth in environment with a pH higher than 7.9 or lower than 2.9. As for nutrition, the species is capable of breaking down various types of carbohydrates - such as chitin, cellulose, and poly-/tri-/di-/monosaccharides -, alcohol, nitrate, ammonium, and nitrogen-containing compounds to support its growth. Mophologically, colonies grown on corn meal agar, malt extract agar, and oatmeal agar at 28¬∞C display a well spread out uniform white mat in 14 days. The colour of the colonies then darkens as time goes on, changing from white to brown to black - the color of maturity. The black color is largely due to the dark-coloured spores that form as the fungi matures. Ascomata of the fungi is a submerged globose cleistothecia color dark brown and is usually 60-200 Œºm in diameter The ascomata of the fungi is encased with a brown, semi-transparent, pseudoparenchymatous, double membraned textura epidermoidea - thin and tightly packed peridium. The peridium is also smooth walled and not bristly. Inside the ascomata, the shape of the spore bearing asci of the fungi can range from pyriform to ovate to clavate to ellipsoidal The asci of the fungi are also always 8-spored, and evanescent - disintegrating varying in size from 24x14 Œºm to 40-20Œºm The Ascospores of the fungi are unicellular, brown-dark green in colour, and ellipsoidal. The ascospores of the fungi are also observed to only have germ pores at 1 end, with the other end being truncated. The dimension of the ascospores range from 9x5 - 16x9 Œºm. The species present no anamorphic or asexual form. Physiology In addition to the species' ability to metabolize various carbohydrates and other chemical compounds for its growth as previously mentioned; Pseudothielavia terricola also produce bioactive compounds that possess great clinical research value. Thielavin A (C31H34O10)and B (C29H30O10) are two compounds that was isolated from Pseudothielavia terricola culture. These two compounds were shown to be structurally similar to depsides - which consists of three hydroxybenzoic acid groups Additionally, the melting point for the two compound was determined to be 235-236¬∞C and 250¬∞C respectively; They are insoluble in water but soluble in multiple organic solvents including methanol, ethanol, acetone, chloroform, and pyridine. In a study published in 1981, Thielavin A and B were demonstrated to be novel inhibitors of Prostaglandin synthesis, targeting arachidonic acid - prostaglandin H2 conversion and prostaglandin H2-prostaglandin E2 conversion respectively. Overproduction of prostaglandin in the human body has been linked to body pain, fever, inflammation and diarrhea, painful menstruation, arthritis, even certain forms of cancer. The discovery of Thielavin A and B in pseudothielavia terricola could prove useful in the field of clinical research targeting patients with prostaglandin dysregulation. Habitat and ecology The fungi is a cosmopolitan species and is mainly found in soil, fecal matter, plant seeds, and roots of decaying plant. The distribution of the species is noted to concentrate along the tropical region, with documented appearance in multiple parts of Africa - such as Sudan, Sierra Leone,and Nigeria -, Kuwait, Pakistan, India, Nepal, New Guinea, Japan and et cetera. Distribution in regions distant from the tropics are also present, countries such as the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States also have been reported to show the presence of this species In terms of habitat, the fungi have been reported to grow on a variety of soils. To list a few, the species have been found in forest soils, grassland, grass plots with Dichanthium annulatum, rice fields, and saline soil. In addition, the species has been isolated from other miscellaneous material of plant and animal origin. The species has been found on materials such as decaying strawberry plant, decaying Cordia dichotoma fruit, rhinoplane of barley, seeds of wheat and groundnuts, cotton, kernels of Arachis hypogaea, and the dung of various animals (Monkey, sheep, cow, elephant).

The Palazzo delle Poste building in Palermo History The building was designed by the rationalist and later fascist government architect Angiolo Mazzoni in the early 1920s. Construction was begun on the structure in 1929 and the building was inaugurated in 1934 with the Italian government's communications minister Umberto Puppini in attendance. The Palermo flood occurred from February 21‚Äì23, 1931 while the building was being constructed and during that time a large crane which was being used to erect the post office collapsed onto a neighboring building. The building was damaged by fire in 1988 and then in 2017 the building was reopened for visitation. The building is featured in episode #4, \\"From Palermo to Mt. Etna\\" (which premiered on August 26. 2020), of Great Continental Railway Journeys on the BBC and presented by Michael Portillo.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_2140 Architecture =The building= The style of the building is typical of the fascist period and falls under the rubric of Italian Rationalism. It covers an area of 5100 m¬≤, which is symmetrically structured around two side courtyards. The structure is rendered in reinforced concrete and clad in gray marble from Mount Billiemi. The front colonnade is formed by 10 columns each 30 meters high. Also of note is the large elliptical staircase with a diameter greater than 9 meters. =Interiors= The interiors are done in the style of Futurism, one of the few examples an interior created as such from the time. All the details were attended to by Mazzoni such as the copper-clad doors, the specially designed window handles, the lighting and the choice of marble and stone all from Italy except the black stone of the staircase, as he desired. Most striking perhaps is the conference room, with works by the Futurist painter Benedetta Cappa, five panels on canvas depicting land, sea, air, telegraphic, radio communications. There are also two paintings by Tato and another by Piero Bevilacqua, \\"Radio and television\\". Finally there is a bronze sculpture by Corrado Vigni, \\"Diana the Huntress\\". The waiting room which precedes the conference room is impressive as well with an intense blue tiling. Originally on the right side of the building there was a large lictorian beam, as tall as the entire building and also in marble, which was removed at the fall of the fascist regime.

Hercules at the crossroads, also known as the choice of Hercules and the judgement of Hercules, is an ancient Greek parable attributed to Prodicus and known from Xenophon. It concerns the young Heracles/Hercules who is offered a choice between Vice and Virtue‚Äîa life of pleasure or one of hardship and honour. In the early modern period it became a popular motif in Western art.  History  = Classical period = The parable stems from the classical era of ancient Greece and is reported by Xenophon in Memorabilia 2.1.21‚Äì34. In Xenophon's text, Socrates tells how the young Heracles, as the hero contemplates his future, is visited by the female personifications of Vice and Virtue (Ancient Greek: ŒöŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± and ·ºàœÅŒµœÑŒÆ; Kak√≠a and Aret√©). They offer him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life, and present their respective arguments. Xenophon credits the invention of the parable to Prodicus. He cites a precursor in Hesiod's Works and Days, which also contrasts the paths of vice and virtue. The motif then appears in a number of works by ancient Greek and Roman writers. Aristophanes used it in a humourous way in the comedy The Birds, where Heracles has to choose between kingship and a tasty meal and almost chooses the meal. In book 15 of the epic poem Punica by Silius Italicus, the military commander Scipio Africanus appears in a situation modeled on the choice of Heracles. The literary device of a contest in dialogue appears within many different genres throughout the literature of ancient Greece. It is related to the controversy stories in the Gospel of Matthew. = Early modern period = In the Renaissance the story of Hercules at the crossroads became popular again, and it remained so in Baroque and Neoclassical culture. It became a part of the broader motif of psychomachia: the battle of spirits or soul war. Petrarch used it in De vita solitaria (1346) and established it in the mainstream of Renaissance humanism as a figure of the choice between a contemplative life and an active life. Petrarch had read Cicero's summary of the story in De Officiis. Like Xenophon, Cicero stresses the hero's solitude as he deliberates with himself. Four decades after Petrarch's adaptation, Coluccio Salutati reintroduced the original moral choice between Virtus and Voluptas, using Cicero's Latin words. Famous examples from the visual arts include Albrecht D√ºrer's print Hercules at the Crossroads (1498), Paolo Veronese's Allegory of Virtue and Vice (1565), Annibale Carracci's The Choice of Hercules (1596), Gerard de Lairesse's Hercules between Virtue and Vice (1685) and Mariano Salvador Maella's mural in the Royal Palace of Madrid, Hercules between Virtue and Vice (1765‚Äì66). The story appears in musical compositions such as La√üt uns sorgen, la√üt uns wachen by Johann Sebastian Bach and The Choice of Hercules by George Frideric Handel.

Early life Cornelia Martin was born in New York City on 22 September 1877. She was the only daughter of the socially ambitious Bradley Martin and Cornelia Sherman Martin. She had two brothers, Sherman Martin and Bradley Martin Jr., who became president of the Nineteenth Ward Bank. Her mother threw the infamous society costume party, the Bradley-Martin Ball, at the Waldorf Hotel in 1897. Despite her intentions of creating an economic stimulus during the recession, the event was criticised for its excessive consumption and is today best remembered as among the most extravagant of the Gilded Age excesses. Her paternal grandparents were Henry Hull Martin and Anna (n√©e Townsend) Martin. Her paternal uncle was Frederick Townsend Martin. Cornelia's mother was the only child and heir of Isaac Sherman, a retired merchant of Buffalo and New York who lived on West Twentieth Street in New York City and was close friends with Abraham Lincoln. Personal life While her family was renting Balmacaan, a Scottish highland estate, from Lady Seafield, Cornelia met William Craven, 4th Earl of Craven. Lord Craven, later a Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire, had become the Earl of Craven in 1883, at the age of fourteen. William was the eldest son of the late George Craven, 3rd Earl of Craven,G.E. Cokayne; with Vicary Gibbs, H.A. Doubleday, Geoffrey H. White, Duncan Warrand and Lord Howard de Walden, editors, The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant, new ed., 13 volumes in 14 (1910-1959; reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000), volume III, page 506. and his wife, the former Hon. Evelyn Laura Barrington (second daughter of George Barrington, 7th Viscount Barrington, who was a Member of Parliament for Eye). Cornelia, who was then only sixteen years old, and William, who was twenty-four, were married on 18 April 1893 at Grace Church, New York City. The marriage gave Cornelia a $75,000 a year allowance, and bought the Earl property in Mayfair and paid for the renovation of Coombe Abbey, his family estate in Warwickshire which got a new roof, structural repairs, and its first electric lights. Together, Cornelia and William were the parents of one child, a son and heir born in 1897: * William George Bradley Craven, 5th Earl of Craven (1897‚Äì1932), who married Mary Williamina George, daughter of William George OBE, Town Clerk of Invergordon, on 14 October 1916. On 10 July 1921, whilst racing at Cowes Week, Lord Craven fell overboard and drowned at age 52, with his body washing ashore two days later. =Later life= After his death, Cornelia sold Coombe Abbey to a builder named John Grey in 1923 and moved to another Craven estate, Hamstead Lodge in Hamstead Marshall. At Hamstead Marshall, Cornelia often hosted Princess Marie-Louise, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, who divorced her husband Prince Aribert in 1900 at age 28, and never remarried. Her only child, the 5th Earl, died on 15 September 1932 and was succeeded in the titles by Cornelia's grandson, William Craven, 6th Earl of Craven (1917‚Äì1965). In 1956, she donated Ashdown House, Oxfordshire, which had been requisitioned for use by the British Army during World War II, to the National Trust. The Dowager Countess of Craven died at her home in Newbury, Berkshire on May 24, 1961. After her death, she bequeathed Prince Charles Louis, Count Palatine, by Anthony van Dyck, , to the National Portrait Gallery. In popular culture Between 1910 and 1914, she was photographed by H. Walter Barnett, which is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London. During the 2014-2015 exhibition at London's National Portrait Gallery, Cornelia was featured among the high- profile American heiresses to marry into British aristocracy. Included in the exhibition were Jeanette ('Jennie') Churchill (n√©e Jerome), Lady Randolph Churchill, Mary Victoria (n√©e Leiter), Lady Curzon of Kedleston, Mary Carolyn Campbell ('May', n√©e Cuyler), Lady Grey-Egerton, Consuelo Montagu, Duchess of Manchester, Consuelo (n√©e Vanderbilt), Duchess of Marlborough (later Mrs. Balsan), John Spencer-Churchill, 10th Duke of Marlborough, Lord Ivor Spencer- Churchill, Marguerite Hyde ('Daisy', n√©e Leiter), Countess of Suffolk.

The genus Longipedia comprises 23 accepted species and is distributed worldwide. The Longipediidae generally are long and missile shaped, with segmented bodies covered by hard chitin. Longipedia utilize thoracopods to move, pulling themselves through the water. Distinctive features of Longipedia species are an elongated P2 endopod; and a tooth on the P2 endopod third segment. Identification and differentiation between Longipedia species can be difficult due to morphological similarities among species.  Phylogeny  Until recently the family Longipediidae was classified in the section Polyarthra of Harpacticoida. Recent genetic analysis has reclassified that section as a separate order, the Canuelloida. The morphological differences of the Polyarthra from the other Harpacticoids have also been identified as a reason for separation of Polyarthra from the other Harpacticoids. The new order, Canuelloida, includes the families of Longipediidae and Canuellidae.  Distribution  The Longipediidae are located throughout the world in brackish and marine waters. Most frequently they have been identified in shallow marine habitats with sandy or muddy sediments. They have also been identified on macroalgae, in seagrass beds and in marine plankton. Recently a new species of Longipedia has been identified in samples from a Caribbean mesophotic coral reef. This species is unusual because the depth at which it was found is not typical of other Longipedia species, suggesting that the range of habitats supporting Longipediidae may be greater than previously understood.  Growth and development  Like other copepods, Longipedia larvae have a planktonic naupliar larval stage, and through molting go through six stages to become copepodites. Once larva metamorphose to the copepodite form, they continue to molt in five stages, adding complexity and size over time. As nauplius, planktonic Longipedia have good swimming abilities. As copepodites, they remain close to a substratum.  Habitat and behavior  Longipedia species are benthic or hyperbenthic filter feeders. In the Mediterranean, various Longipedia species were identified as detrital feeders, while others were identified as phytophile. Longipedia species are preyed upon by small fish and corals. In seagrass beds they are more abundant in the intertidal zone, in the top few centimeters of substrate. In Costa Rica, Longipedia were found on the Caribbean coastline. In the mesophotic reef, the newly discovered species was collected with coral, but the sample also included substrate, so the specific habitat of the species and role in the ecosystem was not identifiable. In a study analyzing sediments and stomach contents of small fish in the North Sea, it has been noted that a species of Longipedia constituted the majority of the biomass in the sediments during the summer months. This increase was attributed to the increase in phytoplankton in sediment following the spring bloom, providing ample food to the copepods, and the copepod breeding activities.

She was a founder member of the Design Research Unit, wrote books and magazine features on architecture and design, designed products and interiors, and undertook several collaborative architectural commissions with her husband, the architect (Sir) Leslie Martin. According to her obituary, she \\"made a contribution in her own right and with her husband to the very best in design today\\".  Early life and education  Sadie Speight was born in Church Street, Standish, Lancashire, one of two daughters of Alfred Speight, a doctor, and his wife, Mary Annie Urmston. She was educated at St Mary's and St Anne's, Abbots Bromley, and Manchester University, where she graduated with first-class honours from the school of architecture in 1929. Her sister, Kathleen, also studied at Manchester. Speight was a Prix de Rome finalist and held a travelling scholarship in 1929, which enabled her to study abroad. In 1930 she received the Royal Institute of British Architects‚Äô silver medal for drawing and was elected an Associate. She held a fellowship at Manchester University in 1932 and gained her master‚Äôs degree in 1933. She worked as an architectural assistant to Halliday and Associates in Manchester (1930‚Äì34) and then undertook research in Spain as recipient of the RIBA Neale Bursary in 1934.  The Modern Movement and design journalism  Speight met her future husband, Leslie Martin, when they were students at Manchester University. He bought her an engagement ring in 1927, and they married a number of years later, on 3 January 1935. In the 1930s Speight, who continued to work under her own name, and Martin developed a productive partnership designing a number of private houses together, as well as a kindergarten in Cheshire. Perhaps the best known of the houses they jointly designed was Brackenfell, Cumbria (1938; now Grade II-listed), whose client was the textile designer and artist Alastair Morton (1910‚Äì1963); the house features a large window over the garage, providing light for his studio. Along with Martin, Speight also formed friendships with and became part of the group of leading modernist architects, sculptors and artists in Britain, including Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo. Other collaborative projects in the 1930s included the design of the Good Form range of modular furniture for W. Rowntree & Sons and the publication of The Flat Book (1939), an advice manual for modern home owners. According to design historian Jill Seddon, Speight‚Äôs ‚Äòachievements in product design and shop layout reveal a particular flair for the use of colour and the grouping of objects, which surely owed much to her early contact with the champions of abstract art in Britain‚Äô. Speight also played an important role in British design and architecture journalism in the mid-20th century. In 1943 Nikolaus Pevsner invited her to compile the new 'Design Review' feature of The Architectural Review, a section highlighting contemporary design which ran from 1944 until 1946. At the time, she was '... the only female writer to make a regular contribution during a period when the only permanent female staff working on the magazine occupied administrative or secretarial positions'.  Post-war career  Speight was a founder member of the Design Research Unit, which was set up by the Council of Industrial Design to enable designers to make their skills available to industry. With the greater emphasis on high- quality design for mass production, she designed kettles, textiles and electric irons. A collaborative project with Leonard Manasseh, for the Festival of Britain in 1951 was the design of the Rosie Lee cafeteria at the ‚ÄòLive Architecture‚Äô exhibition in Lansbury, London. Later work included interiors for Swansea University in the 1950s and Cambridge colleges in the 1960s. She was also involved in planning exhibitions and books about her husband's work. In later life Speight worked on converting an apple store and stables in Norfolk as a retreat. She died on 23 October 1992 in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire.

Design According to missile expert Fabian Hinz it could be a copy of the Iranian Soumar missile or the Russian Kh-55. However, the size of the missile is smaller than the Iranian one, and its range is much shorter due to having less room aboard for fuel, and due to being a ground- launched rather than an air-launched cruise missile. He added that there are differences between the Soumar missile and the Quds-1 missile like \\"the entire booster design, the wing position, the Quds 1's fixed wings, the shape of the nose cone, the shape of the aft fuselage, the position of the stabilizers and the shape of the engine cover and exhaust\\".

Founding The institute was established in 1912 as part of the School of Agriculture at the University of Cambridge. Rowland Biffen was the first director and was close with William Bateson who was leading studies of hereditary in Cambridge following the rediscovery the pioneering genetic research of Gregor Mendel in 1900. Biffen began studying cereal breeding in the early 1900s with the aim of producing improved varieties for farmers and millers and also to test whether Mendel's laws applied to wheat. He demonstrated that resistance to yellow rust was controlled a dominant trait and this culminated in the release of the rust-resistant variety Little Joss in 1910 which was widely grown for decades and used as a parent for many other varieties. The institute was located to the West of Cambridge and shared land with the School of Agriculture that is today the site of the North West Cambridge development. The first research students were J. W. Lesley who later made important contributions to the genetics of tomato and Frank Engledow who later became Drapers Professor of Agriculture. Engledow described the facilities as \\"two acres of land on Gravel Hill Farm, a cage, a not very large shed and a small greenhouse.\\" Work was initially mundane, consisting of recording the yields of different wheat varieties, but led to the release of Yeoman in 1916, which combined high yields with strength (the quality required for bread-making). During the first World War, research at the institute ground to a halt, but began to rapidly expand afterwards and into the 1920s when two new research stations were attached to the institute, the Horticultural Research Station in 1922 and the Potato Virus Station in 1926 of which Redcliffe N. Salaman was the director until 1939. The National Institute of Agricultural Botany was established in 1919 in order to separate the commercial aspects of varietal improvement from the more academic pursuits at the PBI. NIAB would distribute the seed of new varieties produced at the PBI, but only after testing showed them to be distinct and superior to existing varieties. This arrangement effectively discouraged workers at the PBI from developing new varieties and freed them to study plant physiology and genetics. In the 1920s, Engledow collaborated with the statistician Udny Yule to develop techniques to analyse crop yields and published a series of papers on yield formation and associated traits in cereals. Salaman developed methods to test for the presence of viruses in seed potatoes and developed techniques to build up stocks of virus-free seed potatoes, a technique adopted by many other countries. Yeoman II was released in 1925 but it was a commercial failure and marked the high point of Mendelian thinking in UK plant breeding. Biffen retired in 1936 and recommended Herbert Hunter, a barley breeder with close links to Guinness and who had worked at the PBI since 1922, become the new director. Unlike his predecessor, Hunter disputed the necessity of Mendelian thinking to varietal improvement, instead believing that success relied on finding parents with desirable traits and crossing them with existing popular varieties. The appointment was doubted by Alfred Daniel Hall, the founder of Wye College because Hunter was \\"a plant breeder and not a geneticist\\" During the 1930s the PBI released high-yielding barley varieties, but their poor malting quality meant that they were not adopted by farmers. George Douglas Hutton Bell was the director from 1940 to 1971. From the late 1940s to the 1960s, the low price of barley in comparison to meat made it an attractive animal feed creating a niche for the PBI's barley varieties that led to them dominating the UK barley market. Move to Trumpington In 1948 it was announced that the institute would move from its site on Cambridge University Farm to a new site with improved facilities and more staff. At the same time, management would be transferred away from the university to a new independent body. The new site was opened in Trumpington, 2 miles south of Cambridge, in 1955. Ralph Riley was the director from 1971-1978. Richard B. Flavell joined in 1969 and built up a large department investigating plant molecular genetics. Privatisation The institute was privatised in 1987 as part of Margaret Thatcher's government policies to divest from profitable industries and that \\"near-market\\" agricultural research should be funded by industry rather than the state. At the time the institute's wheat varieties had 90% of the UK market and 86% of the cereal acreage. The plant breeding parts of the institute were sold to Unilever for ¬£68m who then sold it only one year later to Monsanto for ¬£350m. The more research-orientated parts were moved to form 'The Cambridge Laboratory' in Norwich and this later merged with the John Innes Centre. In 2004 Monsanto sold the wheat breeding part of the business to RAGT Seeds and in 2008 the institute moved from Trumpington to a new headquarters between Sawston and Saffron Walden. The impact of the privatisation on wheat breeding has been studied by several authors.

It was released in 1980. Recording The album was recorded using analogue technology in April 1971, January and December 1977, October and December 1978 and January and February 1979 in the Salle Wagram, Paris.Debussy, Claude: M√©lodies, EMI Classics CD, CMS 7 64095-2, 1991 Cover art The covers of the LP and CD versions of the album both feature a photograph by Lauros-Giraudon of a detail of T√™te de jeune fille vue de profil by Aristide Maillol (1861-1944), a painting in the Mus√©e Rigaud, Perpignan.Debussy, Claude: M√©lodies, EMI Path√© Marconi LP, 2C 165 16371-4, 1980 Critical reception Claude Debussy portrayed by Marcel Baschet in 1884 Alan Blyth reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in December 1980. Debussy's limitations as a songwriter, he wrote, had been hinted at by Paul Dukas: \\"If he sets a given text, his efforts tend less towards training his thoughts on it than, by a sort of personal paraphrase, to note the musical impressions suggested to him on reading the poem.\\" The m√©lodies on the album's first two discs, Debussy's earliest essays in the form, were evidence that Dukas had been correct. Written in a \\"pleasing but rather anonymous style\\", they did little to magnify the emotions inherent in their verse. It did not help matters that several of them were performed disappointingly. G√©rard Souzay, recorded late in his career, was far from compelling, and Mady Mespl√©, also well past her prime, could offer only \\"a thin, squeaky tone wholly inadequate to the task in hand.\\" It was left to Mich√®le Command in the Cinq po√®mes de Baudelaire to serve both words and music satisfactorily. In the remainder of the collection, things improved markedly. Debussy grew in power and discrimination, seeing beneath the surfaces of his texts into their hearts, and the quality of the singing improved in parallel. The Dutch soprano Elly Ameling, \\"though not wholly idiomatic\\", sang \\"with all accustomed good manners and thoughtfulness\\" in the Proses lyriques and the first set of F√™tes galantes. The American Frederica von Stade was \\"suitably languorous and relaxed in Ariettes oubli√©es, with clearer words than one is accustomed to hear from her in this kind of music\\". Command was \\"appropriately seductive\\" in the Chansons de Bilitis. And Souzay, recorded much later than on Side 1 ‚Äì the album was taped at intervals over some eight years ‚Äì sang the Villon Ballades and the second set of F√™tes galantes in a way that few others could have equalled. Ameling concluded the recording with a beautiful rendition of some delicate Mallarm√© settings and Debussy's sorrowful, angry First World War Christmas carol for homeless children. Dalton Baldwin's accompaniments were technically proficient if not the last word in nuancing or fantasy, the audio balance not helping him by relegating his piano too much to the background. Even with all its faults, Blyth concluded, the album was not one that Debussy enthusiasts should pass by ‚Äì it was unlikely that another such survey of Debussy's m√©lodies would appear for some time.Gramophone, December 1980, p. 860 Charles Baudelaire photographed by √âtienne Carjat, circa 1862 Lionel Salter reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in May 1992. Like his colleague, he thought that the songs which Debussy had composed in his youth were much the album's weakest. \\"Content merely to sketch a suitably atmospheric background to the words\\", they contained little of Debussy's musical personality, and it was unfortunate that many of them had been allotted to Mady Mespl√©. With her \\"fast vibrato and bright coquettish voice\\", she was a poor choice for m√©lodies that demanded a vocal flavour more like burgundy and less like prosecco. G√©rard Souzay too, \\"tired and old\\", was a less than perfect advocate for the music of Debussy's novice years. Things went more happily when one of the other three artists sang. Elly Ameling was good in Debussy's juvenilia, better in the masterpieces of his maturity and touching in the \\"appealing innocence\\" that she brought to the wartime carol that he had composed not long before his death. Mich√®le Command conveyed all the eroticism of the Chansons de Bilitis and her Baudelaire group, the latter especially beautifully done. But even her singing could not rival the \\"languorous and ecstatic\\" Ariettes oubli√©es that were Frederica von Stade's brief contribution to the album, their sensuality variegated by a suitable merriment in the carousel-themed 'Chevaux de bois'. Souzay, finally, compensated for his unhappy efforts on the album's first disc by providing some of the choicest items on its third: his Villon group and his Promenoir des deux amants displayed \\"a style probably unmatched by any other interpreter\\". As Blyth had thought in 1981, Dalton Baldwin's accompaniment was dependable but a little stolid, and not always ideally balanced by EMI's production team. EMI's insert booklet was not one of the company's finest: it contradicted the album's claim to completeness by asserting that Debussy had composed some eighty songs rather than the anthology's sixty, and omitted the helpful translations that had been included when the album was released on vinyl.Gramophone, May 1992, p. 81 Track listing, CD1 Claude Debussy (1862-1918) Elly Ameling * 1 (3:08) Nuit d'√©toiles (Th√©odore de Banville, 1823-1891) * 2 (2:00) Fleur de bl√©s (Andr√© Girod) G√©rard Souzay * 3 (2:15) Beau soir (Paul Bourget, 1852-1935) * 4 (1:20) Mandoline (Paul Verlaine, 1844-1896} Mich√®le Command * 5 (3:46) La belle au bois dormant (Vincent Hyspa) Mady Mespl√© * 6 (2:45) Voici que le printemps (Paul Bourget) * 7 (3:40) Paysage sentimental (Paul Bourget) * 8 (1:59) Z√©phyr (Th√©odore de Banville) * 9 (2:46) Rondeau (Alfred de Musset, 1810-1857) Quatre chansons de jeunesse *10 (2:08) I Pantomime (Paul Verlaine) *11 (2:43) II Clair de lune, 1st version (Paul Verlaine) *12 (1:32) III Pierrot (Th√©odore de Banville) *13 (3:34) IV Apparition (Stephane Mallarm√©, 1842-1898) *14 (3:47) Rondel chinois (Anonymous) *15 (2:42) Aimons-nous et dormons (Th√©odore de Banville) *16 (2:50) Jane (Leconte de Lisle, 1818-1894) *17 (3:05) Calmes dans le demi-jour (Paul Verlaine) *18 (2:15) Romance (Paul Bourget) Mich√®le Command *19 (2:14) Les cloches (Paul Bourget) *20 (2:04) Les angelus (Gr√©goire Le Roy) Elly Ameling *21 (2:16) Dans le jardin (Paul Gravollet) G√©rard Souzay *22 (2:04) La mer est plus belle (Paul Verlaine) *23 (2:48) Le son du cor s'afflige (Paul Verlaine) *24 (1:17) L'√âchelonnement des haies (Paul Verlaine) Elly Ameling F√™tes galantes, Set 1 (Paul Verlaine) *25 (3:07) I En sourdine *26 (1:13) II Fantoches *27 (2:43) III Clair de lune Track listing, CD2 Mich√®le Command Cinq po√®mes de Charles Baudelaire (Charles Baudelaire, 1821-1867) * 1 (7:44) I Le balcon * 2 (4:08) II Harmonie du soir * 3 (5:46) III Le jet d'eau * 4 (4:51) IV Recueillement (M√©ditation) * 5 (2:55) V La mort des amants Elly Ameling Prose lyriques (Claude Debussy) * 6 (5:58) De r√™ve * 7 (3:17) De gr√®ve * 8 (5:32) De fleurs * 9 (3:56) De soir Frederica von Stade Ariettes oubli√©es (Paul Verlaine) *10 (3:11) I C'est l'extase *11 (2:37) II Il pleure dans mon c≈ìur *12 (2:30) III L'Ombre des arbres dans la rivi√®re *13 (3:00) IV Paysages belges ‚Äì chevaux de bois *14 (2:07) V Aquarelle No. 1: Green *15 (2:27) VI Aquarelle No. 2: Spleen Track listing, CD3 Mich√®le Command Trois chansons de Bilitis (Pierre Lou√øs, 1870-1925) * 1 (2:31) I La fl√ªte de Pan * 2 (3:16) II La chevelure * 3 (2:¬£6) III Le tombeau des Na√Øades G√©rard Souzay F√™tes galantes, Set 2 (Paul Verlaine) * 4 (2:17) I Les ing√©nus * 5 (1:56) II Le faune * 6 (3:54) III Colloque sentimental Chansons de France (Charles d'Orl√©ans) * 7 (1:04) I Rondel: \\"Le temps a laissi√© son manteau\\" * 8 (2:22) II Rondel: \\"Pour ce que plaisance est morte\\" Le promenoir des deux amants (Tristan Lhermitte) * 9 (2:52) I Aupr√®s de cette grotte sombre *10 (1:46) II Crois mon conseil, ch√®re Clim√®ne *11 (2:11) III Je tremble en voyant ton visage Trois ballades de Fran√ßois Villon (Fran√ßois Villon, circa 1431-1463) *12 (4:12) I Ballade de Villon √† s'amye *13 (4:33) II Ballade que Villon feit √† la requeste de sa m√®re pour Notre-Dame *14 (2:00) III Ballade des femmes de Paris Elly Ameling Trois po√®mes de St√©phane Mallarm√© (St√©phane Mallarm√©) *15 (2:53) I Soupir *16 (2:01) II Placet futile *17 (2:16) III √âventail *18 (2:30) No√´l des enfants qui n'ont plus de maisons (Claude Debussy) Personnel =Performers= * Elly Ameling, soprano * Mich√®le Command, soprano * Mady Mespl√©, soprano * Frederica von Stade, mezzo- soprano * G√©rard Souzay (1918-2004), baritone * Dalton Baldwin, piano =Other= * Eric Macleod, producer * Serge R√©my, balance engineer Release history In 1980, EMI Path√© Marconi released the album as a set of four LPs (catalogue number 2C 165 16371-4), accompanied by a booklet providing notes by Stefan Jarocinski and the texts of the songs in English and French.

She is a multiple Ontario University Athletics and U Sports (formerly Canadian Interuniversity Sport) track champion and has competed for the Canadian U23 National Team. A Blackfoot from Alberta's Blood Tribe (also known as the Kainai Nation), SpearChief-Morris was the (female) recipient of the 2017 Tom Longboat Awards, awarded annually by the Aboriginal Sport Circle to the most outstanding male and female indigenous athletes in Canada. Her mother is Kainai First Nation and her father is an African- American from Los Angeles. Currently, she holds the 115th position in the World Ranking of the International Association of Athletics Federations for 100-meter hurdles, scoring 1137 points. Her best position to date in such an event has been 111th. In the Women's Overall Ranking, she occupies the 1400th position. In June 2019, SpearChief-Morris was announced as part of the Canadian delegation for the 2019 FISU Summer Universiade, held in July, in Italy. In the 100-metre hurdles, she obtained the fifth place in the final (13.34 seconds). That was her first time competing in the hurdles on the international stage. She is training to win a spot on the Canadian Olympic team and compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Japan.  Personal life  SpearChief-Morris was born in Lethbridge, Alberta, in a family that loved basketball. As a child, she was influenced by her older brother Julian SpearChief-Morris to practice sports and describes herself as a \\"multi-sport athlete all through school\\". In elementary school, SpearChief-Morris's favorite events were track and field and the high jump, but she also practiced volleyball and basketball. She ultimately chose to join track and field, as she excelled in the sport above her peers. In high school, she won the 100-metre at the Alberta Provincials and eventually decided to pursue her favorite sport on a competitive level. She graduated from Lethbridge Collegiate Institute high school in 2012. Her brother, Julian SpearChief- Morris is the first indigenous student to head Harvard Law School's venerable Legal Aid Bureau.  Athletic career  As a result of her performance in high school, The University of Guelph wanted the young athlete on their team, and paid her an official visit. According to SpearChief-Morris, during her time in Guelph, she met distance runners and a jumper but, as a 100m and 200m athlete, she would have preferred to spend time with the team's sprinters. Still looking for a place to develop as an athlete and as a student, SpearChief- Morris pursued a pathway to universities in the United States, but her options did not satisfy her academic expectations. Eventually, SpearChief-Morris earned a scholarship to the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver with the assistance of her high school vice-principal. Despite that, most of her financial aid was based on academic performance and external entrance scholarships. She left her hometown and headed to Vancouver in the Fall of 2012. At UBC, she first met coach Derrick Johnston. According to him, the athlete stood out since the first training sessions and started to develop as a sprinter at the 100 metres and 200 metres. In the second year at UBC, SpearChief-Morris was not satisfied with her academic program, and changed it once to classical archaeology and once again to anthropology. All the alterations were made before the end of the year. At the same time, she did not receive a scholarship raise and the team atmosphere was not as good as before. In addition, coach Derrick Johnston accepted a job offer from the University of Western Ontario (UWO), located in London, Ontario. Coach Derrick Johnston suggested to Western's head coach, Vickie Croley, the addition of SpearChief-Morris to the track and field team. Soon after, the athlete moved to UWO and, once again, switched her academic program to history with a minor in First Nations studies. The athlete considers her \\"choice to transfer to Western one of the best decisions\\" she has ever made. SpearChief-Morris holds the UWO school records for the 60-m (7.4s) and 60-m hurdles (8.28s) events and is a four-time All-Canadian athlete. She is also the winner of seven U Sports national championship medals, including the 2016 women's 60-m sprint national title. In 2014, SpearChief-Morris' international debuted during the NACAC Under-23 Championships in Athletics in Kamloops, British Columbia. Her 100-m relay team took home the silver, behind the United States. Three years later, after graduating from UWO, SpearChief-Morris changed her training location, moving from London to Santa Barbara, California. There she joined the Santa Barbara Track Club, intending to make the Canadian Team for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Since 2012, her idol is the American Olympic and World track and field sprinter champion Allyson Felix. According to SpearChief- Morris, what she most admires in Allyson is her dominance in so many events. Initially, SpearChief-Morris thought that California would be the best training location, but she did not enjoy her experience and opted to return to Ontario.  Education  Joy SpearChief-Morris has a Bachelor of Arts in History and First Nations Studies from the University of Western Ontario (UWO). Currently, she studies a master's degree in Political Science specializing in Transitional Justice at UWO. Her research focuses on Indigenous treaties, land claims, and reconciliation in Canada. Nowadays, SpearChief-Morris also works as a program coordinator assistant at the Indigenous Student Centre at the UWO.  Volunteerism  She volunteers extensively within Canadian indigenous communities and aspires to be a role model for aboriginal youth. In 2017, she was awarded the Student Athlete Community Service Award by both the OUA and U Sports. SpearChief-Morris is both a \\"volunteer speaker and motivator for the Kainai 5 km Community Fun Run, which encourages health and fitness in the Kainai community. She was also the keynote speaker at the Kainai Truth and Reconciliation Conference's First Nations Track and Field Day, where she spoke about the power of sport.

She is the creator of the Stonewall Riots collections and founded the Lesbian Cartoonists' Network. Biography Andrea Natalie spent her childhood in Arizona and moved to New York to attend school at Cornell University. She worked in Los Angeles for several years as a waitress, cab driver, and janitor. She was 22 when she moved to New York City and came out as a lesbian. Shortly after, Natalie became involved in radical lesbian feminist politics and was the media representative for Sonia Johnson's presidential campaign. She also ran a lesbian adventure social club called Women About. Natalie wanted to become a playwright, but ultimately turned to comics in 1989.  Career  Andrea Natalie's cartoons follow a single-panel style. In addition to the three collections she published, Natalie's works have been syndicated in many gay and lesbian newspapers across the United States. Her cartoons cover a wide variety of subjects but primarily center around themes of politics, feminism, and queer culture in the late 80s and early 90s. = Works and contributions = * Natalie, Andrea.

She received several positive reviews for her collections in feminist newspapers like Sojourner: the Women's Forum. Other lesbian cartoonists also supported and commended Natalie's work such as Alison Bechdel, Roz Warren, and Kris Kovick. = Awards and recognition = * 1991 Hot Wire Reader's Choice recipient * 1991 Lambda Literary Award nomination for Stonewall Riots (1990) * 1993 Lambda Literary Award nomination for The Night Audrey's Vibrator Spoke: A Stonewall Riots Collection (1992) = Lesbian Cartoonists' Network = Natalie created the Lesbian Cartoonists' Network as a way for queer, feminist artists to connect and get support from one another. She founded the newsletter because she did not have anyone to look up to and speak with when she was starting out. The newsletter was written mostly by cartoonists and discussed how to get work published and syndicated and what art supplies are useful for beginners. The free newsletter was sent to members quarterly. Natalie recruited people to join the network by asking members for their contacts, finding cartoonists that were printed in obscure lesbian newspapers, contacting mainstream cartoonists, and putting notices about the LCN in 500 queer papers. Cartoonists who joined the network said that the LCN helped them feel more visible and informed as artists. = Artist influences = As a child, Natalie only had access to two cartoonists: Charles Addams and Edward Gorey. She inherited her feminist beliefs from her mother who guided Natalie to read Betty Friedan. Artistically, Natalie primarily drew influence from Gary Larson who also drew in a single-panel style. She also read Alison Bechdel's comics as a beginner and stated her admiration for Roz Warren. Personal life Drawing cartoons was not enough for Natalie to make a living. She earned money working as a waitress and dancer at a topless bar. Natalie found this work environment boring and not inspirational. She continued in this line of work because she could earn a large amount of money in a small amount of time, which left her more time to work on her cartoons. As of her last recorded interviews, Natalie was planning on attending nursing school as a financial alternative to the topless bar. Over the duration of her years as an active cartoonist, Natalie mentioned she was living with an unnamed partner.

It aired on November 18, 2018. Written by the show's supervising producer Bekah Brunstetter, and directed by Ken Olin, the episode focuses on three major plot points that take place during the third season. The episode also directly succeeds the events of season 3's third episode, \\"Katie Girls\\". As with most episodes of the series, this episode traverses several decades and locations. It primarily takes place in Vietnam (both present-day and the during the Vietnam War), and 1970s Los Angeles, California. \\"Sometimes\\" generally garnered praise for efficiently combining multiple elements of the season.  Plot  The beginning of the episode shows how the original necklace was created and eventually found its way to Hien. Jack and his brother Nicky Pearson are deployed in Vietnam, where Nicky's well being is deteriorating and his behavior is causing problems. Jack asks to be in the same squad as Nicky so that he could look after him, though the act of having family members in the same unit is typically prohibited. In the present, Kevin and Zoe have embarked on an excursion to Vietnam, believing they can find answers about the mysterious local woman in a photograph with Jack, and the necklace that he kept from that era. In the 70s, Rebecca and Jack decide to take a road trip from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles for Rebecca to visit a record label, hoping to acquire a contract out of it. Jack is more nebulous about his plans, simply saying he is meeting \\"some folks\\" in Reseda. Throughout their trip, staying in motels along the way, they become sexually intimate yet Jack is unwilling to talk about the nightmares he has been experiencing. It echoes what Kevin is experiencing with Zoe in Vietnam, who frequently changes the subject when asked about her background and family life. While eating lunch‚Äìa bat dish‚ÄìZoe spots a tourist whom Kevin notices has the same necklace Kevin is trying to find more information about. It turns out the necklace has become a mass produced souvenir. Later, Kevin expresses to Zoe that he is falling in love with her, and she discloses to him that the reason she has been so guarded about her life is that her father molested her as a child. In Vietnam, Jack entrusts a local man named Bao to take him back to his base, whom he surmises is member of Viet Cong who produces land mines‚ÄìBao says, \\"sometimes.\\" In California, Jack is shown to have gone to Reseda to meet the Wattersons, who are the parents of a soldier who died under his watch, having stepped unwittingly on a land mine. Rebecca's audition is ultimately unsuccessful, with the record executives describing her as only \\"Pittsburgh good.\\" When he picks her up, Jack asks \\"Bec\\" to if she can sing her song and while she's singing he weeps.  Reception  \\"Sometimes\\" received a viewership of 8.47 million, slightly higher than the season's average of 8.33 million viewers, with 2.0/8 Nielsen rating for the 18-49 demographic. Entertainment Weekly's David Canfield graded the episode an A-, saying it brought focus to the season compared to previous episodes, and that it was one of the best episodes of the season, though its focus on Kevin meant sacrificing siblings Randall's or Kate's story lines. Based on 10 reviews, the episode received a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus being, \\"'Sometimes' dives deeper into Zoe and Jack's traumatic history and yet, it manages to be an exciting, enjoyable episode.\\" Milo Ventimiglia has received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series nomination for his performance in this episode.

Her work involves the use of in situ transmission electron microscopy to study nanostructure formation. In 2018 she was awarded the International Federation of Societies for Microscopy Hatsujiro Hashimoto Medal. Ross is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society, the Microscopy Society of America and the Royal Microscopical Society,  Early life and education  Ross studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge. She moved to the Department of Materials for her doctoral studies, and completed a PhD in materials and metallurgy in 1999. Her doctoral work considered transmission electron microscopy of silicon oxides. She was appointed as a postdoctoral research associate at AT&T; Bell Laboratories in 1990. Here she began working with electron microscopy to study silicon oxidation and the dynamics of dislocation.  Research and career  In 1992 Ross started her academic career as a staff scientist inn the University of California, Berkeley National Center for Electron Microscopy. She moved to the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1997 where she worked as a research staff member. Here she developed various microscopic techniques, including in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By monitoring the growth of materials in situ it is possible to understand the nucleation and growth of materials, including observing individual nucleation events and transient intermediate states. She can change the growth conditions (for example temperature, pressure or choice of solvent) and establish how these variables impact the growth of materials. At IBM Ross monitored self-assembly mechanisms, including the processes by which nanowires form using chemical vapor deposition and the growth of quantum dots. By controlling the growth of nanowires it is possible to form complicated structures, which can be used in transistors, batteries and sensors. To grow the nanowires in an electron microscope Ross uses small catalytic particles, a flat substrate and a gas that contains silicon. She heats the substrate to 500 degrees celsius, at which temperature the gas begins to react with the metal catalysts and depositing silicon beneath the particles. She has demonstrated this nanowire growth for silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide and gallium phosphide. These nanowires can be used to bridge electrical contacts, allowing Ross to understand the relationship between physical structure and electronic performance. She joined the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018. Here she is developing a TEM for Two-dimensional materials in one of the MIT quiet rooms. These rooms minimise interference from electromagnetic fields and temperature fluctuations. Ross plans to investigate where three- dimensional nanocrystals grow on two-dimensional materials. She has previously demonstrated that it is possible to use electrochemical electron-beam lithography to write, read and erase these nanocrystals. Two-dimensional materials are difficult to study using conventional equipment because electron microscopes can damage their structures. In an effort to avoid this, Ross has proposed using lower voltage electrons as well as a high vacuum. In 2018 Ross was awarded the Hatsujiro Hashimoto Medal in recognition of her work on electron microscopy. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 1999 Institute of Physics Moseley medal * 2000 Materials Research Society Outstanding Young Investigator Award * 2003 Microscopy Society of America Burton Medal * 2011 Fellow of the American Physical Society * 2012 Fellow of the Microscopy Society of America * 2017 Honorary Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society * 2018 Hatsujiro Hashimoto Medal * 2019 Gerhard Ertl Lecture Award = Selected publications = Her publications include;   References  Category:Materials scientists and engineers Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Frances M.

He followed this up with another 30 appearances in 2013 season as Bohemians ended up in tenth. He re- signed for Bohemians for the 2014 season and made 28 league appearances, primarily at right-back. New boss Keith Long named Pender as captain for the 2015 season, a position he has held ever since. He made 13 league appearances in the first fourteen games before an injury ruled him out for the rest of the season. Bohs went on to finish fifth, just missing out on European football. Recovered from injury, Derek missed just three of Bohemians' 33 league games in 2016 season. In October 2017 Derek signed on for the 2018 season in which he played 19 times, scoring once. He would also captain Bohemians in the two matches of their 2018-19 Scottish Challenge Cup run. O 16 July 2019, Pender received a one-match ban along with UCD goalkeeper Conor Kearns after both were punished for violent conduct during a match in which the Students had beaten Bohemians 1-0.

The game is played in real-time with four player teams in battle mode, in which the team that has the most treasure at the end wins. Every battle takes place within a location from the One Piece series. Production and gameplay The mobile game is a collaboration between Bandai Namco Entertainment, One Piece author Eiichiro Oda, anime production studio Toei Animation, and the manga publisher Shueisha. It was initially released on March 29, 2018 for Android and iOS platforms and was taken offline on April 10, 2018 for long-term maintenance and was later re-released with graphics and gameplay overhaul on January 31, 2019. One Piece Bounty Rush has a team of four players competing against another team of four players in real-time, with each battlefield being based on a location within the One Piece series. The winner is whichever team has the most coins at the end of a battle. Players can enhance a character's level by collecting in-game items from either the story mode or a battlefield. Each team has to place their own flag on treasure to claim it. The four character types within a team are Runner, Attacker, or Defender. The runner grabs points, the attacker fights enemies, and the defender moves enemies out of the way. There are a variety of characters to choose from and each character has their own attacks. The attacks include a basic combo and special skills. When using a basic combo, the player has to attack whatever character is closest. Every point from claiming treasure gives the player a small bonus after the battle. When a basic combo is finished, the enemy is knocked down, but they have the ability to not be harmed while getting back up.  Reception  The game's pre-launch test had one million players. On June 1, 2020, the game's Facebook page reported 20 million downloads. Dave Aubrey, of Pocket Gamer, wrote, \\"I don't hate One Piece: Bounty Rush at all, but after getting a feel for how much effort would be required to level up characters and play with a larger variety, it's not something I want to return to.\\" Dan M. Scarborough said in a Blue Moon Game review, \\"One Piece Bounty Rush is a shift from gacha style to a real-time PvP action game, which is quite a brave move. However, mere bravado is not enough for a game to succeed, a lesson many developers learned the hard way. This game is just not worthy of the effort you need to invest in order to have some reward.\\" References External links *Official site Category:2018 video games Category:Action video games Bounty Rush Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Gacha games ","title":"One Piece Bounty Rush"},{"id":"61805048","text":"Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1797.

Biography Lallah Perry accepting the Mississippi Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts, April 2008 Lallah Miles was the oldest of four children born to Lee Ellis Miles and Rebecca Stodghill in Auburn, Alabama where her father was a plant pathologist at Alabama Polytechnic Institute (later renamed Auburn University.) She began painting at the age of thirteen. In 1928, when she was two years old, she moved with her parents to Starkville, Mississippi when her father took a position with the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Experiment Station at Mississippi State University in Starkville, Mississippi. While the family was in Starkville her first younger brother, Robert Lee Miles, died within hours of his birth in 1934. Three years later, her eight-year-old brother Charles Miles died from an allergic reaction to an insect bite. Both boys were returned to Auburn to be buried at Pine Hill Cemetery, and Charles' grave marker, a broken statue of a boy holding a tray with a lizard, is one of the more well-known markers in the cemetery.Kazek, Kelly (2011). The Hidden History of Auburn, p. 72. The History Press, Charleston, SC. . When she was fifteen years old, her father died by a heart attack and her mother moved her and her younger brother back to Auburn. Lallah had been homeschooled up to this point but enrolled in Auburn High School and graduated at the age of sixteen. She had met her future husband, James Lafayette \\"Dick\\" Perry, back in Mississippi. While he was serving in the Navy during the Second World War, she enrolled at Alabama Polytechnic Institute and graduated at the age of nineteen with a degree in commercial arts. She married Dick Perry in December 1943 and, after graduation, moved with him to his hometown of Philadelphia, Mississippi where they started a family. She continued painting and began to attend the early days of the Mississippi Art Colony at Allison's Wells. By the 1950s her works were being selected for local exhibitions and winning prizes. She and her husband would go on to have four children. In 1964 she began to teach art, at first in the Choctaw Tribal Schools and then in local public schools. In 1969 her husband died while piloting his small aircraft in a landing attempt at the local airport. Following his death she earned a master's degree in art education at Delta State University. She would continue to teach, serving for many years at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi and Meridian Community College in Meridian, Mississippi. In the 1970s, she and artist Edward Gong owned an artist supplies store in Boyle, Mississippi called Innovations. In her later years she was represented by Southern Breeze Art Gallery in Jackson, Mississippi. She died in Jackson, Mississippi in October 2008 and is buried in Cedarlawn Cemetery in Philadelphia, Mississippi.

The vehicle made its world premiere at the Tokyo Motor Show in October 2009, and had its European debut at Geneva the following March. The styling of the EV-N concept would influence the later Honda N-One (2012) and Urban EV Concept (2017). The Urban EV concept also derived its styling from the first generation Civic hatchback and later reached production as the Honda e in 2019. Design The concept was styled to deliberately evoke the N360, first sold in 1967. The EV-N project was led by Kanna Sumiyoshi, who also collaborated with Yuuki Nagasawa on the interior design, and Sayuri Hanzawa was responsible for color and trim. The exterior was designed by Naoya Ishikura. The design embodied the Honda philosophy of \\"man maximum, machine minimum\\" to emphasize operating and space efficiency; the interior is sufficiently large to accommodate four adults. In addition, the exterior and interior styling were made as simple as possible to \\"reduce superfluous flesh\\"; Honda's head of design, Nobuki Ebisawa, believed that younger drivers would \\"see [the N360-like] style ‚Äî as translated into the EV-N ‚Äî as very new\\" and would appreciate the simple styling rather than the retro elements. Rear of EV-N Solar cells embedded in the roof panel allow recharging of the vehicle while it is parked. Interior seats use a frame to support stretched fabric panels, which can be swapped. The seat structure was chosen to reduce weight and increase passenger space. The space under the bonnet is used as the car's trunk, although the rear seats can also be folded down to accommodate cargo. The car is equipped with the Honda LOOP vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. The driver may also communicate with the car via a handheld LOOP device, which includes a liquid-crystal display to provide basic information, such as how long the car has been parked and its state of charge; the front fascia of the EV-N lights up as the driver (with the LOOP) approaches or departs. One Honda U3-X personal mobility device is attached to the interior panel of the passenger-side door. The EV-N, U3-X, and other vehicles were shown at Tokyo as part of Honda's HELLO! (Honda ELectric mobility LOop) display. Although Honda had declared the EV-N was a styling exercise only, Honda CEO Takanobu Ito was surprised by the strong interest in the car from foreign press. In 2010, the EV-N concept was shortlisted for the Brit Insurance Design Awards in the Transport category. Production Honda N-One (2014) The styling of the 5-door Honda N-One kei car, as an homage to the N360, is also inspired by the EV-N concept. The N-One was launched in fall 2012 with conventional (gasoline engine) power.

Serialized in the manga magazine Comic Beam from September 2013 to February 2018, the series follows two veterans of the Imperial Japanese Army in the aftermath of World War II. Areyo Hoshikuzu received widespread critical acclaim, winning a Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and the Grand Prize at the Japan Cartoonists Association Awards. Synopsis Described by publisher Kadokawa Shoten as a \\"bromance in the ruins of Tokyo\\", Areyo Hoshikuzu is set in 1946, a year after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. Tokutar≈ç Kawashima, a demobilized Japanese sergeant and veteran of the Second Sino- Japanese War, reunites with Kadomatsu Kuroda, a private first class who served in his squad. The series follows the two men as they navigate life in occupied Tokyo, including their encounters with the black market, \\"pan pan girls\\", and the Recreation and Amusement Association. Production Series creator Sansuke Yamada has stated that as a student, he fostered an interest in the post-war period and the history of occupied Japan through the works of , Akiyuki Nosaka, and Komimasa Tanaka. He was motivated to create Areyo Hoshikuzu after noting that while there are multiple popular manga series set in the later stages of the Japanese economic miracle, such as Chibi Maruko- chan and Sunset on Third Street, comparably fewer series have been set in the immediate aftermath of the war. In developing Areyo Hoshikuzu, Yamada sought to maintain a high level of historical accuracy, and researched period- specific military uniforms and equipment, drew landscapes based on historical news photography, and interviewed officers of the Japan Self-Defense Forces to confirm troop numbers and locations during the war. Areyo Hoshikuzu is noted as Yamada's first longform manga series for general audiences, following a career in which he was best known as a creator of gay manga. While the series is not a gay or boys' love (BL) manga, Yamada has stated that audiences \\"can read it as BL\\" given its narrative focus on close bonds between men. Certain stylistic hallmarks of Yamada's gay manga artwork appear in Areyo Hoshikuzu, notably the hirsute and bear-like appearance of its lead characters. Media Areyo Hoshikuzu was serialized in the manga magazine Comic Beam from September 2013 to February 2018. The series has been collected into seven tank≈çbon (bound volumes) published by Kadokawa Shoten: Internationally, the series is published in French by Belgium-based publisher Casterman under the title Sengo. Reception Areyo Hoshikuzu has received widespread critical acclaim. The series was praised by HuffPost for its balancing of comedic and serious subject material, and commended its non-revisionist treatment of war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan. In 2015, Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! ranked the series as the fifth best manga for male readers based on its survey of manga and publishing professionals, and Freestyle's The Best Manga 2015 ranked it as the third best manga of the year. In 2019, Areyo Hoshikuzu won the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in the New Creator category, and the Grand Prize at the Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.

The settlement nearest the lake is the village of Vanush. The local name for this lake is Mamraz (meaning hornbeam in Persian), but it is better known by the names \\"Ghost Lake\\" or \\"Lake of Ghosts\\" - given it in reference to its eerie swampland landscape featuring countless half-drowned trees, often shrouded in mist, giving them the appearance of phantoms.  Natural history  'The Lake of Ghosts' or 'Hornbeam Lake' has long been regarded as a site of natural beauty by virtue not only of its geographical location, but also of a flora rich in plant species, both woody and herbaceous. This lake has been registered in the Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization of Iran by the registered number of 402 in order to preserve its animal and plant species. The formation of the lake took place over a geological timespan extending from the middle Cretaceous to the Quaternary period. The length of the lake is and its width is and in total it covers an area of with the surface and its surroundings covered with alder and hornbeam trees. The hornbeam is a tree species native to Iran which can reach heights of between , with a trunk bearing smooth, gray-green bark. The dead or moribund specimens protruding from the lake have suffered considerable decay from having been partially submerged in its waters for many years. Unlike the hornbeams, the alders are well-adapted to the wetland habitat of the lake and are thus in better health. For all its strange beauty, the Lake of Ghosts has not yet been promoted seriously as a tourist attraction and, as yet, lacks any facilities which could make it such. It can be accessed only on rough roads requiring the use of four-wheel drive vehicles - and even then only safely at certain times of year.  Media and related videos  Films and documentaries on the lake have been made or are being produced. One of these is named The Lake of Ghosts by Reza Jafari Jozani with Dr. Hesam Bani-Eghbal.Works of fiction inspired by the lake may include a novel of the same name written by Darren Shan, under the name of 'The Lake of Souls'.

It was created around 1836, as the plot formerly occupied by the convent of Capuchinos de la Paciencia was planted with elms and acacias. The square, known as the \\"plaza de Bilbao\\", was populated in the 1860s with conifers and magnolias. In 1931, in order to avoid the repetition of placenames, the square was renamed to \\"plaza de Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla\\", in honor of the noted republican politician. 2018 Madrid Pride. Following the end of the Civil War in 1939, the new Francoist administration toyed with the idea of renaming the square after On√©simo Redondo (a Fascist politician who had died in the war) or using the name of \\"Capuchinos de la Paciencia\\" (in a nod to the predecessor of the square), but in 1940 the authorities ruled the reset of the name to \\"plaza de Bilbao\\". Some years later, in 1944, the City Council decided to rename the space as \\"plaza de V√°zquez de Mella\\", after the Carlist ideologist Juan V√°zquez de Mella. In order to inaugurate the new name of the square, a fountain topped by a bust of the far right politician was unveiled on 24 July 1946. As a parking lot was built in the square in 1950, the fountain was moved first to the Paseo del Prado and then to the neighbouring Plaza de la Plater√≠a de Mart√≠nez, only to return to the plaza de V√°zquez de Mella after 1999, when the square was reformed as the surface parking lot was demolished with a new underground parking lot being built instead.

The best- known relation is the direct proportionality law holding for Classical Cepheid variables, sometimes called Leavitt's law. Discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt, the relation established Cepheids as foundational indicators of cosmic benchmarks for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances. The physical model explaining the Leavitt's law for classical cepheids is called kappa mechanism. History Plot from Leavitt's 1912 paper. The horizontal axis is the logarithm of the period of the corresponding Cepheid, and the vertical axis is its apparent magnitude. The lines drawn correspond to the stars' minimum and maximum brightness, respectively. Leavitt, a graduate of Radcliffe College, worked at the Harvard College Observatory as a \\"computer\\", tasked with examining photographic plates in order to measure and catalog the brightness of stars. Observatory Director Edward Charles Pickering assigned Leavitt to the study of variable stars of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, as recorded on photographic plates taken with the Bruce Astrograph of the Boyden Station of the Harvard Observatory in Arequipa, Peru. She identified 1777 variable stars, of which she classified 47 as Cepheids. In 1908 she published her results in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College, noting that the brighter variables had the longer period. Building on this work, Leavitt looked carefully at the relation between the periods and the brightness of a sample of 25 of the Cepheids variables in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912. This paper was communicated and signed by Edward Pickering, but the first sentence indicates that it was \\"prepared by Miss Leavitt\\". In the 1912 paper, Leavitt graphed the stellar magnitude versus the logarithm of the period and determined that, in her own words, Using the simplifying assumption that all of the Cepheids within the Small Magellanic Cloud were at approximately the same distance, the apparent magnitude of each star is equivalent to its absolute magnitude offset by a fixed quantity depending on that distance. This reasoning allowed Leavitt to establish that the logarithm of the period is linearly related to the logarithm of the star's average intrinsic optical luminosity (which is the amount of power radiated by the star in the visible spectrum). At the time, there was an unknown scale factor in this brightness since the distances to the Magellanic Clouds were unknown. Leavitt expressed the hope that parallaxes to some Cepheids would be measured; one year after she reported her results, Ejnar Hertzsprung determined the distances of several Cepheids in the Milky Way and that, with this calibration, the distance to any Cepheid could then be determined. The relation was used by Harlow Shapley in 1918 to investigate the distances of globular clusters and the absolute magnitudes of the cluster variables found in them. It was hardly noted at the time that there was a discrepancy in the relations found for several types of pulsating variable all known generally as Cepheids. This discrepancy was confirmed by Edwin Hubble's 1931 study of the globular clusters around the Andromeda Galaxy. The solution was not found until the 1950s, when it was shown that population II Cepheids were systematically fainter than population I Cepheids. The cluster variables (RR Lyrae variables) were fainter still. The relations Period-luminosity relations are known for several types of pulsating variable star: type I Cepheids; type II Cepheids; RR Lyrae variables; Mira variables; and other long-period variable stars. =Classical Cepheids= Period-Luminosity Relation for Cepheids The Classical Cepheid period-luminosity relation has been calibrated by many astronomers throughout the twentieth century, beginning with Hertzsprung. Calibrating the period-luminosity relation has been problematic; however, a firm Galactic calibration was established by Benedict et al. 2007 using precise HST parallaxes for 10 nearby classical Cepheids. Also, in 2008, ESO astronomers estimated with a precision within 1% the distance to the Cepheid RS Puppis, using light echos from a nebula in which it is embedded. However, that latter finding has been actively debated in the literature. The following relationship between a Population I Cepheid's period P and its mean absolute magnitude Mv was established from Hubble Space Telescope trigonometric parallaxes for 10 nearby Cepheids: : M_\\\\mathrm{v} = (-2.43\\\\pm0.12) \\\\left(\\\\log_{10}P - 1\\\\right) - (4.05 \\\\pm 0.02) \\\\, with P measured in days. The following relations can also be used to calculate the distance to classical Cepheids, as shown in the page classical cepheid. Impact Phase lightcurve of variable star Delta Cephei. Classical Cepheids (also known as Population I Cepheids, type I Cepheids, or Delta Cepheid variables) undergo pulsations with very regular periods on the order of days to months. Cepheid variables were discovered in 1784 by Edward Pigott, first with the variability of Eta Aquilae, and a few months later by John Goodricke with the variability of Delta Cephei, the eponymous star for classical Cepheids. Most of the Cepheids were identified by the distinctive light curve shape with a rapid increase in brightness and a sharp turnover. Classical Cepheids are 4‚Äì20 times more massive than the Sun and up to 100,000 times more luminous. These Cepheids are yellow bright giants and supergiants of spectral class F6 ‚Äì K2 and their radii change by of the order of 10% during a pulsation cycle. Leavitt's work on Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds led her to discover the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variables. Her discovery provided astronomers with the first \\"standard candle\\" with which to measure the distance to faraway galaxies. Cepheids were soon detected in other galaxies, such as Andromeda (notably by Edwin Hubble in 1923‚Äì24), and they became an important part of the evidence that \\"spiral nebulae\\" are independent galaxies located far outside of our own Milky Way. Leavitt's discovery provided the basis for a fundamental shift in cosmology, as it prompted Harlow Shapley to move our Sun from the center of the galaxy in the \\"Great Debate\\" and Hubble to move our galaxy from the center of the universe. With the period-lumnosity relation providing a way to accurately measure distances on an inter-galactic scale, a new era in modern astronomy unfolded with an understanding of the structure and scale of the universe.\\"1912: Henrietta Leavitt Discovers the Distance Key.\\" Everyday Cosmology. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2014. The discovery of the expanding universe by Georges Lemaitre and Hubble were made possible by Leavitt's groundbreaking research. Hubble often said that Leavitt deserved the Nobel Prize for her work, and indeed she was nominated by a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1924, although as she had died of cancer three years earlier she was not eligible. (The Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.)

It is impounded by the Hart-Jaune Dam at its outlet to the Hart Jaune River. Location The Petit lac Manicouagan is in the unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Mouchalagane, Caniapiscau. It is to the east of Quebec Route 389. The Cartier Railway runs along the southeast shore of the lake. The railway enters the southern tip of the lakeshore through a narrow gorge that leads to the headwaters of the Northeast Toulnustouc River. The lake is divided between the cantons of Hesry (NW), Fagundez (SW), Le Courtois (SE) and Leventoux (NE). The northern tip is in the canton of Tilly. The southern arm extends into the canton of Forgues. The Petit lac Manicouagan is in the watershed of the Beaupr√© River, a tributary of the Manicouagan Reservoir. The lake contains of water and covers . The watershed covers . Name The Innu word Manicouagan has been taken to mean \\"where bark is taken\\" or \\"drinking vessel\\". The related term Mrnikuanistuku Shipu means \\"river by the cup\\". P√®re Lemoine mentions two meanings: \\"place where we remove birch bark\\" and \\"Where we give a drink\\". Possibly the terms are connected, since birch bark was used to make a bowl to drink water. The Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec has speculated that the Petit lac Manicouagan was named because of its spoon shape. Natural resource use and conservation The Uapishka Biodiversity Reserve protects the Monts Groulx massif to the south of the lake and the Hart Jaune River. A population of Caribou has made use of the region around the lake in the past. This group was near the southern limit for caribou in 1972, although in the past caribou had ranged much further south. The Petit Lac Manicouagan population was hunted in fall in the 1970s and 1980s, and in winter in the 1990s. The fall harvest decreased during the 1970s and 1980s. The harvest was much higher in the winter. Some caribou herds have been in sharp decline, and as of 2017 it was not known whether the Petit lac Manicouagan herd still existed. Parts of the southwest shore of the lake are in the Bersimis (Pessamit) Reserve, a recognized beaver reserve. The Betsiamites (Pessamit) heritage site includes around the Hart Jaune River and the Petit lac Manicouagan. Dam The Hart-Jaune dam and power plant have their origin on 26 January 1957 when the Qu√©bec Cartier Mining Company was created by U.S. Steel to supply iron ore concentrate. On 21 February 1957 the Queen, with the advice and consent to the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, authorized leasing the water powers of the Hart-Jaune River and the Petit Lac Manicouagan, including the right to regulate the flow of the river and to store water in the lake. The dam was built in 1960. In September 1998, following an environmental impact review, Hydro Quebec was given permission to undertake a back-filling project over a distance of in Petit lac Manicouagan and the Hart Jaune river to rehabilitate the riprap protection of part of the upstream facing of the retaining structures for the Hart-Jaune complex. The dam has affected the free movement of fish. Forecasting The Petit Lac Manicouagan basin is one of five catchment basins in the Manicouagan watershed, the others being Manic-5, Toulnoustouc, Manic-3 and Manic-2. Daily meteorological forecasts for each basin are used to derive streamflow predictions. Studies of data for these watersheds has shown that accuracy can be improved significantly by combining data from several sources, followed by statistical post-processing.

She is particularly known for her longstanding work using analog modular synthesis systems. Fraser has been a prolific writer of both electronic and acoustic music for films, television and TV commercials since the 1970s. She has received Clio awards for her work with Lexus and Adidas.  Early life  Born in Cincinnati, OH, Jill started classical piano training at age 4. In 1962, the family moved to Chapel Hill, NC. While she was still in high school, composer Roger Hannay heard her compositions and allowed her to attend his classes at the University of North Carolina. Fraser went on to earn a Bachelor of Music degree from East Carolina University, where she studied with Otto Henry and composed her first electronic works using a Moog IIIp modular synthesizer system. At the urging of composer Morton Subotnick, Fraser left North Carolina to attend California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), where she was mentored by both Subotnick and Mel Powell, and attended master classes with John Cage and Lou Harrison. During this time, Fraser composed on the Buchla modular system and worked as an assistant to Morton Subotnick, helping to create voltage control tracks for the composer's original Nonesuch Records release of \\"A Sky of Cloudless Sulfur.\\" After receiving her M.F.A. from CalArts in 1978, Fraser began work at Serge Modular Music in Hollywood, where she built her first modular synthesizer system. The first Serge synthesizers had been introduced at CalArts five years earlier by composer/inventor Serge Tcherepnin. Together with Berkeley-based Don Buchla's seminal designs, these modular instruments came to define the \\"West coast synthesis\\" approach to electronic music creation, focusing on waveshaper techniques and non-traditional controllers, such as touch plates, rather than the subtractive synthesis and piano-style keyboard controllers characteristic of \\"East Coast synthesis.\\" The relatively compact and accessible Serge modular systems were designed to democratize the sonic possibilities provided by the larger, costlier modular systems produced at the time by Buchla, Moog and ARP. Today, Fraser continues to perform and record with classic original Serge modules, along with modern analog and digital electronics. In 2015, she performed with Tcherepnin and other original members of Serge at a 40-year reunion concert held in San Francisco at The Lab.  Professional career  Beginning in the 1970s, Fraser began work as a session musician and sound designer in Hollywood, bringing her modular system and other synthesizers into the studios. Her unique sonic palette and eclectic musical sensibilities quickly brought her into high demand for film and commercial scoring, where she remains active to this day. While primarily known for futuristic synthesizer scores, she also writes in many styles for acoustic instruments and has employed many well-known musicians, such as Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers, American blues legend Paul Butterfield and renowned session drummer Jim Keltner.  Commercials  Jill Fraser has written original music for hundreds of TV commercials. Her clients include Lexus, BMW, Honda, Porsche, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, NBC, Apple, Adidas, Estee Lauder, Baskin Robbins, Yamaha Motorcycles, Bose, Carl's Junior, Hardee's, Mattel, Nike, and National Geographic, among many others. Fraser has been honored with Clio awards for her work with Lexus and Adidas.  Films  Fraser created the electronic sound effects for the cult classics \\"Zardoz\\"(1974) starring Sean Connery, and \\"Empire of the Ants\\" (1977). She collaborated with Oscar-winning composer Jack Nitzsche to create electronic music for the Paul Schrader film \\"Hardcore\\" (starring George C. Scott), as well as William Friedkin's \\"Cruising\\" (starring Al Pacino) and \\"When You Comin‚Äô Back, Red Ryder?\\". In 1982, Fraser co-composed the score (with Nitzsche) for the movie \\"Personal Best,\\" the directorial debut of Oscar- winning screenwriter Robert Towne and the first starring role for Mariel Hemingway. Fraser's score utilized both analog synthesizers and the then-new Fairlight CMI, one of the world's first digital samplers and audio workstations. Controversial at the time of its release due to the film's exploration of physical attraction between same-sex athletic competitors, \\"Personal Best\\" is today considered a classic and frequently cited as one of the greatest sports movies of all time. Fraser also created synthesizer tracks with Buffy Sainte Marie on the score for the film \\"Spirit of the Wind\\" and later performed live with Sainte Marie, touring with her Serge modular synthesizer in Canada, Europe and the US. Other film scores from this period include \\"Reckless and in Love\\" (starring Meg Foster) and \\"Cutting Class\\" (starring Brad Pitt).  Solo and collaborations  In addition to her work for film and television, Fraser's music has been released on several solo and collaborative albums. Her first CD was \\"Alphabetical Disorders,\\" a collection of synthscapes set to poetry by Ivan E. Roth, released on the pioneering electronic music label Periodic Music in 1988. Fraser's performances with Roth were part of the vibrant Los Angeles punk and spoken word scene curated by Harvey Kubernik, opening for acts such as the Minutemen and Henry Rollins. A collection of Fraser's shorter pieces entitled \\"Smart Shack\\" was released in 2015, followed by electronic duets with the zZyzx Society (2018).  Current works  Since 2017, Fraser has been performing live electronic music with Peter Grenader as the zZyzx Society. They released the album, \\"the zZyx Society\\" in 2018. Fraser is featured in the book, \\"Patch & Tweak: Exploring Modular Synthesis\\" by Kim Bj√∏rn and Chis Meyer.

It was one of 12 manors established after Vordingborg Cavalry District was dissolved in 1884. The Renaissance Revival style main building and home farm were built for Defence Minister Christian Frederik Hansen in 1857 from designs by Ferdinand Meldahl. Both buildings were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1978. History =Early history= Reinhard Iselin painted by Georg Mathias Fuchs, 1766 In 1774, Vordingborg Cavalry District was divided into 12 estates and sold in public auction. Snertingeg√•rd was sold to the wealthy merchant Reinhard Iselin from Copenhagen. He was also the buyer of Vordingborg Castle (renamed rosenfeldt), Ladeg√•rd (renamed Iselingen and Avn√∏g√•rd. =1852-1905: Hansen family= Christian Frederik Hansen In 1804, Iseling's heirs sold Snertingeg√•rd, Iselingen and Marienborg to Hans Henrik Peter Reiersen (27 May 1750 - 29 July 1805). In 1810, he sold Snertingeg√•rd to S. Busk. After Busk's death in 1833, it was acquired by P. Lund. His widow, Sophie Lund, sold Snertingeg√•rd to Christian Frederik Hansen in 1852. He served as Minister of Defence in several governments. Nicoline Marie Berggren, who is believed to have been the illegitimate daughter of Bertel Thorvaldsen, grew up on the Snertingeg√•rd estate. Her mother, who had met Thorvaldsen at Nys√∏ Manor, her previous workplace, worked for Hansen. Hansen's son Christian Frederik Gustav Hansen inherited he estate after his father's death. He was in turn succeeded by his own son, Edward Joachim Hansen. Edward Joachim Hansen's daughter,Agnes Nikoline Hansen, who was born on the estate in 1893, married the zoologist and educator Holger Valdemar Br√∏ndsted. =1905-presentLater history= In 1905, Snertingeg√•rd was acquired by Ludvig Munthe Brun. His widow, Meta Brun, n√©e Nielsen, sold it to P.F. Thymann in 1930. Architecture The main building dates from 1856-1857 and was designed by Ferdinand Meldahl with inspiration from Renaissance architecture. The building is constructed in red brick and stands on a foundation of boulders. It consists of a two-storey main wing with a short side wing. Towards the courtyard is a centrally placed quadratic tower topped by a dome. Surroundings Snertingeg√•rd is surrounded by a large garden. In Snertinge Mose, a bogland, is an important settlement from the Maglemosian culture (9,000-6,4000 b.c.). A large number tools of bone and flint as well as numerous animal bones from aurochs, moose, red deer and wild boar has been retrieved from the site.  Today Snertingeg√•rd was purchased by Klaus Birger Liljegren J√∏nsson in 2004. He has previously been the owner of Fodbygaard at N√∏stved.

He reportedly had condiments thrown at him while reciting the Greek alphabet and was forced to drink alcohol if he made mistakes. Phi Delta Theta suspended the university's chapter after the incident and ten men were arrested. Four of the men were indicted on charges of negligent homicide in March 2018. Gruver was one of several pledges who died in hazing rituals nationwide in 2017, including Timothy Piazza at Penn State University, Andrew Coffey at Florida State University, and Matthew Ellis at Texas State University.  Facts  Gruver's death was said by the coroner to have been caused by \\"acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration.\\" In 2017, a warrant was issued for 10 members of the college fraternity Phi Delta Theta for the charge of hazing. On the night before his death Gruver attended what was called a \\"Bible Study\\" where pledges were asked questions about the fraternity and had to drink alcohol each time they answered incorrectly. They also had to perform some physical exercises during the \\"Bible Study\\" including wall sits while other members walked across their knees. The warrant stated that pledges were also required to lift other members while standing on a book. The pledges drank to excess and Gruver passed out on the couch and checked on him until 3AM at which time he was left alone between 3AM and 9AM. In the morning his pulse was weak and he was rushed to the hospital where he died. Grand jury The grand jury declined to bring charges in one case. and failed to reach consensus in four others. They indicted four men on charges of negligent homicide. There was no consensus whether the national fraternal organization was criminally liable for the death.  Consequences  Matthew Naquin was convicted of negligent homicide in July 2019 for his role in the hazing. Naquin had previously been asked by other fraternity members to tone down interactions with pledges that they described as \\"extreme and dangerous\\". The Louisiana State University chapter of Phi Delta Theta was suspended after the incident by the fraternity's national organization. They also terminated the memberships of the accused, issuing a statement that the termination \\"effectively severs ties with those alleged to be involved.\\" References Category:Hazing Category:2017 deaths Category:Louisiana State University people Category:Phi Delta Theta Category:Criminal homicide ","title":"Death of Maxwell Gruver"},{"id":"61806148","text":"Robert Mortimer (1927-2007) was an American molecular biologist who was a pioneer of introducing single-celled yeasts as a model organism to study the operation of genes and chromosomes.

History =WTMV= WTMV signed on at 6 p.m. on May 19, 1935. WTMV broadcast at 1500 kHz and was owned by the Mississippi Valley Broadcasting Company, with studios in the Broadview Hotel. The station relocated to 1490 kHz after NARBA. Almost immediately after the frequency change took effect on March 29, 1941, the station attempted to increase its power from 250 watts during the day to 1,000 watts day and 500 night. Griesedieck Bros. microphone; while Griesedieck sponsored Cardinal broadcasts when they were on WTMV, by 1951 they had moved to WIL In 1945, Carlin French sold WTMV to William F. Johns of Chicago and his son, Myles H. Johns of Milwaukee; both owned radio stations in Wisconsin. That same year, on April 17, 1945, a young Harry Caray called his first Major League Baseball game over WTMV, a Cardinals broadcast with Gabby Street. Additionally, Caray and Street teamed up to broadcast St. Louis Browns games that were also heard on WTMV and WEW. Beyond baseball, Caray called St. Louis Flyers hockey, basketball, and wrestling events for WTMV. At the same time, Caray hosted KXOK's \\"Sports Extra\\" talk show. The station branded itself heavily as \\"the sports end of your dial\\"; many WTMV sports broadcasts were sponsored by Griesedieck Brothers beer, which also put together the Cardinals baseball radio network beginning in 1947 with WTMV and WEW as its stations in St. Louis. (The Browns moved all of their games to WIL that same year.) Under Johns ownership, WTMV made the first of two incursions into FM broadcasting. While the station had applied for a station at 47.1 MHz in January 1945, when the FM band was still 42 to 50 MHz, WTMV-FM 102.5 did not begin operations until July 28, 1949. WTMV-FM was not a success; even though the AM-FM stations were profitable in 1949, WTMV tried, to no avail, to get the Federal Communications Commission to waive its minimum hours of operation rule for the FM side. (Note that this piece erroneously states WTMV is in Evansville, Indiana.) The WTMV-FM license was deleted at the station's request on December 31, 1952. =WAMV= In October 1957, WTMV changed its call letters to WAMV. The station also became the St. Louis ABC affiliate on January 10, 1958, after WIL relinquished the hookup. By this time, WAMV was owned by Robert W. Day and broadcast 24 hours a week of African American programs, as well as two hours a week in Polish. Radio Missouri Corp. sold WAMV in 1959 to the Hess-Hawkins Co. of East St. Louis for $265,000. May 3, 1960, saw WAMV-FM 101.1 hit the air, simulcasting WAMV's programming. =Final years, WBBR experiment and closure= WAMV's final sale came in 1961, when the Stan-Lin Corp. of Jacksonville, Florida, acquired WAMV-AM-FM from Hess-Hawkins for $350,000. Stan-Lin wasted no time making major changes to WAMV's programming. In July, WAMV-AM-FM became WBBR-AM-FM \\"Big Beat Radio\\", with a modern rock-and-roll format. However, the sale application ran into headwinds at the FCC when the commission announced it would review its June 1 approval just a month later, on July 3. While several complaints centered around the format flip planned by Stan-Lin, the sale approval took East St. Louis city officials by surprise. The mayor, Chamber of Commerce, and others protested that they were under the impression the sale had been called off when it had been approved; furthermore, an East St. Louis newspaper had reported, as had others who were advised by the station manager, that there would be no change in management or format of the stations. Stating that there were enough available stations in WAMV's former \\"good music\\" format, the FCC gave the sale final approval in October, though Pete Rahn, TV and radio editor for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, denounced the sale of WAMV to \\"a Southern syndicate that specializes in raucous rhythm-blues programming\\". The station ultimately flipped back to the WAMV call letters and ABC Radio affiliation in June 1963. However, financial troubles were brewing that would ultimately mean the end of the station. That same month, Hess-Hawkins initiated foreclosure proceedings against Stan-Lin, alleging it had never been paid; in East St. Louis city court, it received a $314,000 judgment against the current owners. The judgment, secured by a mortgage on station equipment, also named Thomas Carrillo as WAMV's custodian. After Carrillo announced that the station did not have the money to pay its employees, at midnight on April 24, 1964, WAMV permanently ceased operations. The four engineers were told by the custodian to consider themselves laid off. While Stan-Lin applied for permission to sell the station back to Hess-Hawkins so it could be conveyed to a group of East St. Louis businessmen, this never happened. The ABC affiliation for St. Louis was awarded that July to WBBY 590 in Wood River, Illinois. Comparative hearings for a successor WAMV's closure marked the beginning of years of hearings and competing applications to return the 1490 kHz frequency to use in East St. Louis. A new East St. Louis Broadcasting Company applied for the frequency in February 1965 and was joined by Metro-East Broadcasting. At the start of 1969, FCC hearing examiner Isadore A. Honig proposed the grant of the station to East St. Louis Broadcasting. In finding in favor of East St. Louis, Honig noted the \\"unusually poor\\" broadcast record of Metro-East principal Harmon I. Moseley, who had been found of \\"irresponsible conduct\\" in his time running KAAB in Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he once attacked other local stations on the air. Later in 1969, however, the FCC review board reversed the hearing examiner's ruling and granted Metro-East's application, saying that Moseley was a relatively small stockholder in the applicant. The hearing proceedings finally ended on September 29, 1971, when the FCC granted the East St. Louis application; their WESL went on the air July 10, 1972, more than eight years after WAMV ceased operations. The FM frequency took far less time to return. On May 13, 1966, the Our Lady of the Snows Shrine of Belleville, Illinois, put WMRY on the air.

Under the command of owner Harmon Jones and Captain James Kenmure, she sailed on July 6, 1849 from New Orleans for the California Gold Rush and was feared lost at sea with all hands while sailing around Cape Horn. Twenty-six years later, reports of the crew living as castaways on an uncharted island in the Straits of Magellan mysteriously surfaced. History SS Florinda was a wooden commercial schooner engaged in delivering passengers, lumber and other goods from New Orleans, Louisiana to ports throughout the Northern Gulf Coast. Frederick Arnet was the original owner and master of the schooner until he sold the vessel to Harmon Jones on July 2, 1849 for his voyage from New Orleans around Cape Horn and then to San Francisco, California. Disappearance Florinda sailed from New Orleans on July 6, 1849 with fourteen crew members to the Balize (now known as Pilottown) located at the mouth of the Mississippi River and awaited her captain, Harmon Jones. Florinda then made way first along the coastlines of the Gulf of Mexico to Cape Florida on Key Biscayne near what is today Miami, Florida. She then sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to the Cape Verde Islands. On leaving Cape Verde, she then sailed to Brazil and then onwards around Cape Horn. After a year without further communication with the vessel, Florinda and her crew were feared lost at sea. In 1875, twenty-six years after her disappearance, reports of the crew of Florinda having survived their shipwreck in a storm and who were now living on an uncharted island in the Straits of Magellan surfaced. For most of the summer of 1875, this story caught the imagination of the world until incorrect reporting from the Louisville Courier-Journal confused Florinda with another vessel and it became widely considered a hoax at the time. Interest in Florinda quickly waned and the crew's survival and existence were never further investigated.

In 2019, Richard was named one of Forbes Africa's 30 Under 30 change-makers for challenging rigid notions of masculinity, gender, and sexuality in Nigeria where homosexual acts can be punished with 14 years in prison. In 2017, he was nominated for The Future Awards Africa's New Media Innovation Award. Richard is also a two-time Abryanz Style & Fashion Award Best Fashion Writer nominee. Following the launch of A Nasty Boy magazine in 2017, Richard was named one of the 40 Most Powerful Nigerians under the age of 40 by Ynaija.  Early life and education  Richard was born in Akwanga, Nasarawa State, Nigeria. The second of three boys, he was raised in an upper- middle-class family; his father, a politician, and his mother, a college lecturer. He attended Shepherd's International College, a private, co- educational Christian boarding school, before heading to the Nasarawa State University, Keffi, for his first professional degree in law. He was called to the Nigerian Bar as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in 2017, upon his graduation from the Nigerian Law School, Lagos.  Career  Akuson started his career as a style intern at the age of 18. In 2014, he co- founded ILLUDED, an online photo-sharing platform. In 2016, he was offered a position to head BellaNaija's fashion and style sections -- a position that launched his career through the roof. His work at BellaNaija earned him an Abryanz Style & Fashion Award nomination for Fashion Writer of the Year in 2016. Later that year, Richard left BellaNaija to launch The PR Boy, a boutique PR firm that catered primarily to Nigerian startups. In 2017, while at the Nigerian Law School, he launched A Nasty Boy, the boundary-pushing LGTBQ+ publication that soon grew in stature and international acclaim.  Essays  In April 2019, Richard authored a searing, tell-all essay for CNN detailing the circumstances that led him to flee Nigeria for safety in America. In July of 2019, he wrote a heart-rending essay for The New York Times' \\"Sunday Review.\\" The essay, \\"This is Quite Gay,\\" was prominently published in the Times' web front page and appeared on a similarly prominent position in print, the next day.  Activism and asylum  Richard sought asylum in America in 2018 after fleeing Nigeria upon surviving a brutal homophobic attack. In the U.S., he continues to speak openly about the attack and the insidious culture of homophobia in Nigeria. He has granted interviews to OkayAfrica, Very Good Light, and The Black Youth Project, where he gave great detail surrounding the unfortunate event. Richard continues to be an outspoken activist for the LGBTQ+ and asylum communities in America.

Description Kyphosus hawaiiensis has an oval, deep and well compressed body with a terminal mouth which is slightly oblique ventrally with the front of the upper jaw being bluntly pointed. The body is partially clothed in small ctenoid scales. The dorsal fin is continuous with the anterior part being spinous and contains 11 spines while the posterior part contains 12 soft rays. The spinous part is longer than the soft part but the soft part is higher, especially in its anterior section. The anal fin has 3 spines and 11 soft rays. with the third spine being the longest. The caudal fin is moderately emarginate. The overall colour is bluish grey, however, seems to be able to darken the posterior half of its body to varying degrees, making a distinct bicoloured pattern, or it may be all dark with a pale central band. Often shows a white streak beneath the eye.>ref name = K&C;/> This species attans a maximum total length of . Distribution Kyphosus hawaiiensis is found throughout the Hawaiian Islands and may also occur in the Line Islands. Habitat and biology Kyphosus hawaiiensis is found in small groups in the surge zone at the tops of reefs and in reef drop offs. The fish may be reliably relocated in the same place over a number of years suggesting that this species is terrtorial. It will associate with schools of Kyphosus cinerascens. It feeds by grazing on algal turf growing on rocky substrates and between corals. Species description and taxonomy Kyphosus hawaiiensis was described by Keiichi Sakai and Tetsuji Nakabo in 2004. Previously Kyphosus bigibbus was thought to occur in Hawaii but it was shown that the species in question was different from that species elsewhere and that K. bigibbus did not occur in Hawaii and that the Hawaiian taxon was the endemic K. hawaiiensis.

Her artistic style was expressive, gestural and experimental.  Life, training and influences  Macqueen was born in Carlton, Victoria on 29 January 1912. Inspired by her grandmothers drawings, and encouraged by her parents, Macqueen developed a love for drawing from early childhood. Her primary and secondary schooling was at the Princes Hill State School, Mount Albert Central School and the Methodist Ladies College in Melbourne. She studied commercial art for one year in 1927 at the Swinburne Technical College, and then took private drawing classes with Catherine Hardess in 1928 at Hawthorn. In 1930, at the age of eighteen, she married Allan Macqueen, an older man who was a widower with two sons. Over the ensuing ten years she did very little drawing and was instead occupied with raising three children, a daughter and two sons, who were born between 1931 and 1935. In 1939 Macqueen resumed her drawing and also began to experiment with watercolour painting. In 1941 she returned to Swinburne Technical College to study with William Dargie for a term. Her subject matter during this period consisted of everyday domestic scenes at her home, and the buildings, landscapes and people of Melbourne. In March 1945 she held her first solo exhibition of watercolours at the Kozminsky Galleries in Melbourne. In 1946 she attended drawing sessions with George Bell, who spoke to her about Cubism, Georges Braque and Rauol Dufy. However, her intuitive drawing style was at odds with his highly structural approach and she ceased the lessons when her fourth child was born. Between 1956 and 1958 Mcqueen attended printmaking classes at the Royal Melbourne Technical College, now RMIT University, where she developed a fascination for lithography. To be able to print at home, she converted an old hand mangle into a press, which she continued to use throughout her artistic career. As her printmaking skills and experience increased she was asked to teach for one day a week at RMIT. This was later expanded to include instructing students in free drawing techniques. She taught at RMIT for more than a decade. In the 1960s, Macqueen began to focus on animals as the subject matter for her work. She often visited the Melbourne Zoo to draw animals from life and was particularly fond of drawing giraffes. After her husband died in September 1970 she embarked on several overseas trips, which included visits to England, Mexico, Kenya, Bangladesh, Canada and the United States. These travel experiences contributed to the 1980s being described by Macqueen as \\"the decade which was to become the most interesting and productive in my life\\". Mary Macqueen died at the age of 82 on 15 September 1994.  Style and works  Mary Macqueen's artistic style was typically spontaneous, expressive and gestural. She specialised in line drawing, lithography and mixed media works on paper. Her most successful line drawings efficiently distill the character and essential qualities of her subject matter, which included animals, landscapes and scenes of domestic life. Throughout her career she sought to draw the perfect line. Macqueen believed that \\"a good pure-line drawing takes every ounce of concentration and effort and is a rare achievement\\". In the 1970s, the discovery of handmade Nepalese paper in a Buddhist shop was a crucial moment for MacQueen, as it allowed her to explore drawing on the reverse of the paper to create soft translucent colours and delicate tonal washes. A 1988 exhibition of paper works at the Powell Street Gallery, Melbourne consisted of ink, gouache and collage works on Nepalese paper, notably omitting her line drawings. Many of the works were based on scenes from countries she had visited, and they demonstrate the breadth of her experimentation with the medium. Her work in the exhibition shows influences of Cubism and Fauvism.

Manzano Moreno, \\"The Settlement and Organisations of the Syrian Junds in al-Andalus\\", in Manuela Marin (ed.), The Formation of al-Andalus, Part 1: History and Society (Ashgate, 1998), pp. 85‚Äì114. was the  øAbbƒÅsid- appointed governor of al-Andalus (Spain) in opposition to the Umayyads in AD 763 (AH 146). The chronicles disagree about al- øAlƒÅ æ ibn Mughƒ´th's origins. The Fat·∏• al-Andalus, Ibn al-Athƒ´r, al-Nuwayrƒ´ and al-Ma·∏≥·∏≥arƒ´ claim that he was a native of Ifrƒ´·∏≥iya (Tunisia) sent to Spain by the  øAbbƒÅsid caliph al-Man·π£≈´r (). On the other hand, the AkhbƒÅr majm≈´ øa, Ibn al-·∏≤≈´·π≠iyya and Ibn  øIdhƒÅrƒ´ claim that he was from Beja in southwestern Spain, where he held the local office of riyƒÅsa (political and military headship). The historian Roger Collins inclines to the view that he was a foreigner sent by the caliph.R. Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì797 (Basil Blackwell, 1989), pp. 135‚Äì36. Maribel Fierro is of the opinion that later chronicles confused Ibn Mughƒ´th with his successor, thereby concocting an African origin for him. Al-  øAlƒÅ æ ibn Mughƒ´th set up his government in 763 in Beja, where he had the support of the local Egyptian jund (Arab army division). Although Islamic historiography and much modern historiography treats this event as an internal rebellion against the Umayyads, it is better viewed as conflict over legitimate authority between two rival caliphal lines. The temporary success of Ibn Mughƒ´th is evidence that there existed support for the  øAbbƒÅsid claim in al-Andalus. The Umayyad emir  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I () avoided a pitched battle with his rival and even abandoned his capital, C√≥rdoba, for the fortress of Carmona. Al- øAlƒÅ æ ibn Mughƒ´th besieged Carmona for two months, which suggests that the forces available to  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I were not large. Many Andalusƒ´ leaders must have been awaiting the result of the conflict before deciding which side to support. The Syrian jund of Seville, which had Ya·∏•·π£ubƒ´ members, may have gone over to Ibn Mughƒ´th. According to the AkhbƒÅr majm≈´ øa, the Palestinian jund under GhiyƒÅth ibn  øAl·∏≥ama al-Lakhmƒ´ marched from Sidonia to join the siege but was intercepted by an army under Badr, a freedman of  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn, who negotiated its withdrawal. The siege was ended when a well- timed sortie by the defenders caught the besiegers unprepared. Ibn Mughƒ´th and the other  øAbbƒÅsid leaders were killed in the fighting. His head was secretly sent to Kairouan as a warning to other would-be  øAbbƒÅsid governors. Some sources have it sent, less plausibly, to Mecca.

Description =Geology and topography= Cook Island is formed of ‚Äúrocks from the Lismore Basalt Group, formed by lava flows from the Mount Warning Shield Volcano approximately 20 million years ago.‚Äù The Island is a ‚Äúprotrusion of eroded basalt‚Äù of a maximum height of above sea level and topped with a plateau. The western side of the island has a ‚Äúgentle‚Äù slope while the remaining sides are ‚Äúsheer cliffs‚Äù dropping to ‚Äúlow-lying rock shelves‚Äù. The top of the island and its western side are overlaid by a ‚Äúshallow cover of topsoil.‚Äù A ‚Äúsemi-permanent freshwater basin‚Äù is located in the island's northern side. =Climate= In 2011, the average annual rainfall was reported as being . =Access= Access to the island is considered to be not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service because of the ‚Äúexposed rocky nature‚Äù of the island's coastline and ‚Äúfrequently rough sea conditions.‚Äù Access is not promoted to ‚Äúprotect roosting birds and the nest burrows of wedge-tailed shearwaters which are fragile and can easily collapse under foot traffic.‚Äù Flora and fauna =Flora= As of 2011, there were twenty five native plant species which occupied, in part, three distinct habitats - ‚Äúelevated locations; rocky crevices; and lower sites at the base of cliffs.‚Äù =Fauna= As of 2011, vertebrate animals were represented by 25 species of birds and two reptile species. These included 12 bird species listed as migratory species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and seven fauna species listed as threatened in New South Wales. History =Aboriginal history= Cook Island is located within the area historically occupied by the \\"Minjungbal people of the Bundjalung nation.\\" Also, the island is the subject of \\"traditional knowledge\\" held by the Githabul and Yugambeh aboriginal people. As of 2011, while the Government of New South Wales did not know of any sites on the island of significance to Aboriginal people, the Aboriginal community did know of a \\"number of Aboriginal mythological stories\\" and of \\"some sites\\" associated with the island. For example, the island is known by the \\"Coodjinburra clan of the Bungjalung people\\" as Joongurra-Narrian which translates as \\"the place of pelicans\\". =European history= Endeavour replica in Cooktown Harbour Fingal Head, circa 1934 The first recorded European sighting of Cook Island was made by the English navigator James Cook, who sighted the coast of Fingal Head in 1770. Cook charted the coastline of the island, but made no attempt at settlement. Cook then continued sailing north along the eastern coast of Australia and named two nearby landmarks, Mount Warning and Point Danger, after he was nearly shipwrecked there. In 1823, English explorer John Oxley anchored at the island to take refuge from southerly winds. Two crew members then visited the island and named it Turtle Island, after finding sea turtles and an unidentified shipwreck. Five years later, British admiral Henry John Rous surveyed the Tweed River and named the island, Cook's Isle, the name that has persisted. Australian spearfisher Ben Cropp reported the sighting of a European vessel, wrecked on the island in the 16th century. In 2008, two fishermen, Joel Coombs and Malcolm Anable, were rescued from nearby the island, and later hospitalised, after they were thrown overboard as a result of their boat overturning. In 1970, the name Cook Island was officially assigned to the island, replacing Cooks Island. Since 1998, the island has been managed by the New South Wales Department of Environment and Climate Change and since 2004, by the Department of Primary Industries, as well. It is under the jurisdiction of the Tweed Shire Council, who hold annual clean-up events. Protected areas status The entirety of Cook Island has been the subject of protected area status since 1959 and since 1967, it has been located within the Cook Island Nature Reserve. The waters adjoining the island have been located within the Cook Island Aquatic Reserve since 1998.

She is the CEO and co-founder of the Climate Council, Australia's leading climate science communications organisation. Previously, Amanda co-founded the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, and was National Director for four years. She has also served on Renewable Energy Expert Panels for the Queensland and Northern Territory governments. Amanda was the founding Chair of the Centre for Australian Progress and is a former Board Director at Plan International Australia and the Whitlam Institute. Amanda has won numerous awards including being recognised as one of Westpac‚Äôs 100 Women of Influence and a finalist in Telstra Young Business Woman of the Year Awards.  Early life and career  Amanda was raised in the suburbs of Melbourne. She earned an Arts degree at Melbourne University, followed by a Law degree (Honours) at Monash University. She initially planned to be a human rights lawyer, until she learned about climate change, which she says she realized was going to be ‚Äòa human catastrophe as much as an environmental catastrophe‚Äô. In 2006 McKenzie founded the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, which became ‚Äúone of Australia's largest climate change advocacy groups, with more than 100,000 members.‚Äù She is on the board of the Centre for Australian Progress and on the board of Plan International Australia. In 2011 McKenzie joined the Climate Commission in the position of Senior Communications Advisor. The Abbott Government dismantled the Climate Commission in 2013, and then McKenzie co-ordinated and led the largest crowd-funding campaign in Australia at the time. Upon hearing the news that the Climate Commission would be disbanded, she said to Tim Flannery, \\"How about if we made this a public institution and get it funded by the general public as a not-for-profit?\\" Tim just rubbed his hands together and said, \\"That's a really great idea.\\" This led to $1 million of funding being received in the first few days, $1.3 million in funding within 10 days from a pool of 16,000 people was received. This funding then allowed the commission to re-launch as the Climate Council, a not for profit organisation.  Climate change and renewables advocacy  Amanda McKenzie is CEO of the Climate Council, an independent Australian climate change communications organisation, made up of some of the country‚Äôs leading climate scientists, health, renewable energy and policy experts.}} Under Amanda's leadership, the Climate Council has played a significant role in reshaping the public conversation on climate change in Australia, moving public debate to a discussion of solutions, like renewable energy; shifting the public understanding of extreme weather and climate change with public polling showing that increasingly the public link the two; and elevating renewable energy to a top tier political issue. Amanda is passionate about gaining meaningful action on climate change and isn't afraid to call out our leaders when they are not doing enough to protect Australians from the dangerous impacts of climate change and embrace the clean technologies we have on hand. In 2019 she stated that Morrison's claim that \\"Australia was doing enough on climate change was colossal bulls**t.‚Äù She also reported in 2019 that Australian's would be shocked at the cover ups by the Federal Government. The Climate Council report ‚ÄúClimate Cuts, Cover Ups and Censorship‚Äù provided evidence that the federal government of Australia had reduced climate change funding, ‚Äòrejected advice from climate bodies‚Äô as well as ‚Äòweakened capabilities by cutting jobs at CSIRO‚Äô. \\"I think most Australians would be outraged if they knew the full story,\\" Ms McKenzie said. \\"The Coalition Government has slashed climate science funding, censored important information and repeatedly made false claims.\\"  Media  Amanda is a frequent media commentator on climate and energy topics. Amanda has spoken in the media on topics such as the Climate Council's Clean Job Plan , linking the Black Summer bushfires and climate change , and energy debates in Australia . For example, SBS covered the Climate Council's report in the weeks before the 2019 federal election. ‚ÄúHeatwaves have become hotter and last longer, while droughts, intense rainfall and bushfire conditions have become more severe,‚Äù Ms McKenzie said. ‚ÄúAs Australians experience escalating consequences into the future, they are likely to view this period of missed opportunities and failed leadership with deep dismay.\\" She has also written on the period when the federal government releases their carbon emissions figures, during Christmas when the public is distracted, and how Australia's carbon emissions have risen over the years 2014-2019. Her work on climate change and renewable energy, has been described by the Huffington Post, the ABC, and other media In 2019 she was a speaker for the Smart Energy and Climate Emergency webinar.

Biography He was the sixth child of First Lieutenant and manorial owner Alexander Weichberger and his wife, Amalie. In 1848, the family moved from Krauthausen to Eisenach. From 1860 to 1861, he attended the Polytechnische Schule in Dresden (now the Technical University of Dresden), where he studied architecture. This was apparently not to his liking as, after only one semester, he left to enroll at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar. Until 1862, he studied with Arnold B√∂cklin and Franz von Lenbach then, until 1868, with Alexander Michelis and, finally, with Max Schmidt. His formal studies were interspersed with study trips to Italy and the Baltic Seacoast. In 1876, he married Elise Choinanus, from a family of musicians, who was twelve years his junior. They had four children, including the writer, . From 1877 to 1906, he worked as a free-lance artist, creating paintings and folia of etchings. He also gave occasional drawing lessons. After 1899, he served as a Professor at the Art School in Weimar. He created his initial sketches with brush and paint, focusing on motifs from the Thuringian Forest, R√ºgen and the Tirol. Many of his sketchbooks and drawings are at the Klassik Stiftung Weimar. He died of a heart attack in 1913, at the age of seventy.

Background  In 1907 Muhammad Ali Sardar Afkham (fa) became the ruler of Guilan by Mohammad Ali Shah to control the peasant uprisings. Sardar Afkham had previously executed eleven constitutionalists in Tabriz, and Mohammad Ali Shah trusted him.ÿπŸÑ€å ÿ≠ŸÇ‚Äåÿ¥ŸÜÿßÿ≥ÿå ŸÖŸÇÿßŸÑŸá/ ÿ¨ŸÜÿ®ÿ¥ ÿ¨ŸÜ⁄ØŸÑÿå ÿ®ÿ±ÿ¢€åŸÜÿØ ŸÖÿ¥ÿ±Ÿàÿ∑€Ä ŸÜÿß⁄©ÿßŸÖ.ÿÆÿ®ÿ±⁄Øÿ≤ÿßÿ±€å ÿßŸàÿ¨ ŸÜ€åŸàÿ≤ÿå ÿ¢ÿ∞ÿ± €±€≥€π€∞. As soon as he arrived in Rasht, Sardar Afkham began suppressing the uprising of the peasants and executing many.  Start Constitutionalism in Gilan  The wave of awakening of the Iranian people, which had also spread to Gilan as a result of the excessive oppression of the rulers, had led to the emergence of anti- government free-thinking groups in Rasht. Among the various associations, Sattar Committee (fa) was the most important. Among the people of Rasht, there were ardent opponents of the constitutional government, such as Mullah Mohammad Khamami (fa), who believed that the constitution was one of the innovations of the European people and issued a fatwa in this regard. Khamami assisted Sardar Afkham in the fight against constitutionalism and in his view \\"constitutionalists must be executed and exiled\\". However, various militant associations were formed in the cities of Gilan and in particular Rasht in support of the constitutionalists.  Attack on Sardar Afkham Palace  The rebellion in Rasht began on 8 February. Sardar Afkham had turned the palace into a center of thugs and repressors to counter possible riots. For this reason, the Mujahideen of Gilan, including members of the Sattar Committee, decided to eliminate Sardar Afkham by any means possible. On the day that Sardar Afkham received a party in his palace, with people such as Sepahalar Moin al-Dawlah attending. The Mujahideen of Gilan moved from the three points, first to the house of Yusuf Khan (deputy of the Divan), the second to the garden of Haji Vakil and the third to the house of Mirza Karim Khan. Fifteen of them then stormed into the palace with Sardar Mohya. The rest of the mujahideen, led by Yeprem Khan, went downtown to clash with the law enforcement.  Event Reflection and Impact on the Constitutional Revolution  The battle of Rasht not only reflected the anger and discontent of the Gilani against the tyranny of the rulers, but its reflection throughout Iran gave a new spirit to the constitutionalists and freedom-seekers. The Battle of Rasht also exposed the abuse of some members of the Constitutional Revolution. Eleven men and women were executed by Yeprem Khan's forces for collaborating with the Qajar government, and civil war between the groups was thought to have led to the failure of the constitutionalists.

Biography Robertson joined the Earthworks Poster Collective alongside Mark Arbuz and Chips Mackinolty in 1974. This Collective existed from 1972 until 1979, and utilized screen printing and poster making to create political artworks and posters. These creations covered a wide array of contemporary issues, including the Australian feminist movement, Indigenous Australian and LGBT rights, environmental and unemployment issues, and anti-nuclear concerns. She became a member of the feminist activist group \\"Women Behind Bars\\", and became one of the group's artists in residence.

She was one of the first women commanders of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) against the dictatorial government of Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua from 1974 to 1979. Early years Leticia Herrera was born in Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica during the exile of her father, a Nicaraguan worker and syndicalist who was persecuted during Somoza's dictatorship. She went through a large part of her primary and secondary education in Costa Rica where, at age 14, she had already formed a socialist organization at the institute where she studied. Militancy Leticia Herrera, Dora Mar√≠a, Fanor Urroz (Mariano), and El Gato in June 1979 Thanks to a scholarship, Herrera traveled to the USSR to study at what is now the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia in Moscow, where she graduated with a degree in law. During her time at the Soviet university, she was recruited by an FSLN cell in 1968 to join the Nicaraguan guerrilla movement. Her participation required military training, for which she traveled to Lebanon to be instructed by the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1970, she began her return to Nicaragua, passing through Italy, Spain, Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, until in 1974, she joined Juan Jos√© Quezada's command. Once integrated into the unit, she was given the noms de guerre \\"Vichy\\" and \\"Miriam\\" in order to protect her identity. That same year, she was one of the leaders of Operation December Victory, an assault on President Somoza's residence in which senior government officials were taken hostage. As a result of this raid, there were negotiations between the Somoza regime and the guerrilla command that led to the exchange of the officials for FSLN political prisoners. Its success was an important political victory for the FSLN, although the Sandinista Revolution would not take place until almost five years later. Throughout her participation in the Sandinista Front, where she spent 10 years in hiding, Herrera performed multiple tasks, including being responsible for security of Daniel Ortega after his return to Managua following his release. A short time later, the politician would become the father of the second of Leticia's three children. Post-revolution With the triumph of the FSLN, Leticia Herrera was removed from military work and reassigned to carry out literacy and health campaigns of the new regime, aimed at reducing infant and maternal mortality in Nicaragua. From 1985 to 1996, she was a deputy of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, and was its vice president from 1985 to 1990. She was head of the Sandinista Defense Committee, where she worked with regions, communities, and municipalities to develop brigades for health, literacy, and revolutionary vigilance. In 2007, she was appointed by Ortega's government as consul of Nicaragua in Costa Rica, and was appointed consul in Panama in 2010. She was head of the Directorate of Alternate Conflict Resolution (DiRAC) until her dismissal in 2014.

That is, is a function on such that for every , is a subset of . :* Some authors call a function a multifunction only if it satisfies the additional requirement that is not empty for every ; this article does not require this. :Definition and notation: If is a multifunction in a set then the graph of is the set ::}. :Definition: A function can be canonically identified with the multifunction defined by } for every , where is called the canonical multifunction induced by (or associated with) . :*Note that in this case, . = Open and closed graph = We give the more general definition of when a -valued function or multifunction defined on a subset of has a closed graph since this generality is needed in the study of closed linear operators that are defined on a dense subspace of a topological vector space (and not necessarily defined on all of ). This particular case is one of the main reasons why functions with closed graphs are studied in functional analysis. :Assumptions: Throughout, and are topological spaces, , and is a -valued function or multifunction on (i.e. or ). will always be endowed with the product topology. :Definition: We say that has a closed graph (resp. open graph, sequentially closed graph, sequentially open graph) in if the graph of , , is a closed (resp. open, sequentially closed, sequentially open) subset of when is endowed with the product topology. If or if is clear from context then we may omit writing \\"in \\" :Observation: If is a function and is the canonical multifunction induced by (i.e. is defined by } for every ) then since , has a closed (resp. sequentially closed, open, sequentially open) graph in if and only if the same is true of . = Closable maps and closures = :Definition: We say that the function (resp. multifunction) is closable in if there exists a subset containing and a function (resp. multifunction) whose graph is equal to the closure of the set in . Such an is called a closure of in , is denoted by , and necessarily extends . :*Additional assumptions for linear maps: If in addition, , , and are topological vector spaces and is a linear map then to call closable we also require that the set be a vector subspace of and the closure of be a linear map. :Definition: If is closable on then a core or essential domain of is a subset such that the closure in of the graph of the restriction of to is equal to the closure of the graph of in (i.e. the closure of in is equal to the closure of in ). = Closed maps and closed linear operators = :Definition and notation: When we write then we mean that is a -valued function with domain where . If we say that is closed (resp. sequentially closed) or has a closed graph (resp. has a sequentially closed graph) then we mean that the graph of is closed (resp. sequentially closed) in (rather than in ). When reading literature in functional analysis, if is a linear map between topological vector spaces (TVSs) (e.g. Banach spaces) then \\" is closed\\" will almost always means the following: :Definition: A map is called closed if its graph is closed in . In particular, the term \\"closed linear operator\\" will almost certainly refer to a linear map whose graph is closed. Otherwise, especially in literature about point-set topology, \\" is closed\\" may instead mean the following: :Definition: A map between topological spaces is called a closed map if the image of a closed subset of is a closed subset of . These two definitions of \\"closed map\\" are not equivalent. If it is unclear, then it is recommended that a reader check how \\"closed map\\" is defined by the literature they are reading.  Characterizations  Throughout, let and be topological spaces. ;Function with a closed graph If is a function then the following are equivalent: 1. has a closed graph (in ); 2. (definition) the graph of , , is a closed subset of ; 3. for every and net in such that in , if is such that the net in then ; * Compare this to the definition of continuity in terms of nets, which recall is the following: for every and net in such that in , in . * Thus to show that the function has a closed graph we may assume that converges in to some (and then show that ) while to show that is continuous we may not assume that converges in to some and we must instead prove that this is true (and moreover, we must more specifically prove that converges to in ). and if is a Hausdorff compact space then we may add to this list: 4. is continuous; and if both and are first-countable spaces then we may add to this list: 5. has a sequentially closed graph (in ); ;Function with a sequentially closed graph If is a function then the following are equivalent: 1. has a sequentially closed graph (in ); 2. (definition) the graph of is a sequentially closed subset of ; 3. for every and sequence in such that in , if is such that the net in then ; ;Multifunction with a closed graph If is a set-valued function between topological spaces and then the following are equivalent: 1. has a closed graph (in ); 2. (definition) the graph of is a closed subset of ; and if is compact and Hausdorff then we may add to this list: 3. is upper hemicontinuous and is a closed subset of for all ; and if both and are metrizable spaces then we may add to this list: 4. for all , , and sequences in and in such that in and in , and for all , then .  Sufficient conditions for a closed graph  * If is a continuous function between topological spaces and if is Hausdorff then has a closed graph in . * Note that if is a function between Hausdorff topological spaces then it is possible for to have a closed graph in but not be continuous.  Closed graph theorems: When a closed graph implies continuity  Conditions that guarantee that a function with a closed graph is necessarily continuous are called closed graph theorems. Closed graph theorems are of particular interest in functional analysis where there are many theorems giving conditions under which a linear map with a closed graph is necessarily continuous. * If is a function between topological spaces whose graph is closed in and if is a compact space then is continuous.  Examples  = Continuous but not closed maps = * Let denote the real numbers with the usual Euclidean topology and let denote with the indiscrete topology (where note that is not Hausdorff and that every function valued in is continuous). Let be defined by and for all . Then is continuous but its graph is not closed in . * If is any space then the identity map is continuous but its graph, which is the diagonal }, is closed in if and only if is Hausdorff.Rudin p.50 In particular, if is not Hausdorff then is continuous but not closed. * If is a continuous map whose graph is not closed then is not a Hausdorff space. = Closed but not continuous maps = * Let and both denote the real numbers with the usual Euclidean topology. Let be defined by and for all . Then has a closed graph (and a sequentially closed graph) in but it is not continuous (since it has a discontinuity at ). * Let denote the real numbers with the usual Euclidean topology, let denote with the discrete topology, and let be the identity map (i.e. for every ). Then is a linear map whose graph is closed in but it is clearly not continuous (since singleton sets are open in but not in ). * Let be a Hausdorff TVS and let be a vector topology on that is strictly finer than . Then the identity map a closed discontinuous linear operator.  Closed linear operators  Every continuous linear operator valued in a Hausdorff topological vector space (TVS) has a closed graph and recall that a linear operator between two normed spaces is continuous if and only if it is bounded. :Definition: If and are topological vector spaces (TVSs) then we call a linear map a closed linear operator if its graph is closed in . = Closed graph theorem = The closed graph theorem states that any closed linear operator between two F-spaces (such as Banach spaces) is continuous, where recall that if and are Banach spaces then being continuous is equivalent to being bounded. = Basic properties = The following properties are easily checked for a linear operator between Banach spaces: * If is closed then is closed where is a scalar and is the identity function; * If is closed, then its kernel (or nullspace) is a closed vector subspace of ; * If is closed and injective then its inverse is also closed; * A linear operator admits a closure if and only if for every and every pair of sequences and in both converging to in , such that both and converge in , one has . = Example = Consider the derivative operator where is the Banach space of all continuous functions on an interval . If one takes its domain to be , then is a closed operator, which is not bounded. On the other hand if , then will no longer be closed, but it will be closable, with the closure being its extension defined on .

The group originally consisted of Rachel Kramer, Bouchra Tjon Pon Fong, Anna Speller, Sita Vermeulen, Bart Voncken, Stefan de Roon and Martijn Terporten. Vermeulen left the group at the end of 2001. In 2003 the band was dissolved due to decreasing success. The group met again at the end of 2015 to organize a one-off concert in 2016. History =2001: Formation, Bulletproof and Vermeulen's first departure= In Starmaker, an idea of John de Mol, a group of 12 youngsters with musical talent moved into the former Big Brother house in Almere with the intention of eventually forming a new six-member pop group. From the beginning of March to the end of May 2001, the participants attended many types of workshops here and were guided by professionals such as Ad Vandenberg, Florent Luyckx and Tjeerd Oosterhuis . Every week a participant was sent home by the viewers. The initial plan was to create a group consisting of six members. However, during the final Sita and Rachel gained an equal number of votes and so it was decided to form the final group with the seven remaining candidates. In addition to the occupation, the band name K-otic was also chosen by the viewers. The names Stars Inc. and Young Guns are falling off.Starmaker-groep heet K-otic, De Telegraaf (11 May 2001) The debut album Bulletproof was released immediately after the end of Starmaker and came in first place a week after the last broadcast in the Album Top 100 . It was by far the best - selling album of 2001 in the Netherlands for Alessandro Safina 's Insieme a te and Not that Kind by Anastacia.Jaaroverzichten - Album 2001, dutchcharts.nl In the 2000-2009 decade overview, the CD finished in 18th Place.Decennium Charts - Albums 2000-2009, dutchcharts.nl More than 235,000 units of Bulletproof were sold, good for twice platinum.Biografie K-otic, Jan Vis The album spawned singles I Can't Explain, I Really Don't Think So and No Perfect World all became hits in the Top 40 and the Mega Top 100. From September 2001, K-otic did an extensive Dutch tour in which venues such as Paradiso and Nighttown are visited. After U2 and Bon Jovi, K-otic was the most visited live act that year. The group also won a Top of the Pops Award in the category Top TV Music Act. Sita Vermeulen left the group at the end of 2001 to start a solo career. Already during Starmaker she was appointed by the makers to go solo. However, due to the group's success, it was decided to postpone this.K-otic, 15 jaar na Starmaker, Aflevering 3 The other band members decided to continue as sextet. =2002‚Äì2003: Indestructible and Dissolution= At the beginning of April 2002, K-otic went into the studio for the second album, Indestructible . The first single Falling was released at the end of May 2002 and again became a Top 40 hit, just like the successor I Surrender, which will be released in August. The album was sold a lot less than its predecessor, but was nevertheless awarded a gold record. The performance on September 28 in Tivoli in Utrecht was one of the few the group gave that year. The success declined further and the group decided to disband. Several group members had already indicated for a while that they were not comfortable with the music and style of the band.K-otic, 15 jaar na Starmaker, Aflevering 4 The last concert was given on January 26, 2003 in Bob's Saloon in Uitgeest. =2011‚ÄìPresent: Reunion= In 2011, the group met privately for the first time again in eight years. Then the first ideas for a real public reunion were born. It finally came in 2016, when it was fifteen years ago that the group was brought together. Through a TV performance at Carlo's TV Caf√© in March, a crowdfunding campaign quickly raised the money needed for a one-off reunion concert. A small hall was initially thought of, but the interest was so great that in December 2016 K-otic returned after 15 years in the Heineken Music Hall, where the group started in 2001.K-otic, 15 jaar na Starmaker, Aflevering 5 The reunion was also used for a six-part documentary series that appeared on YouTube at the end of 2016.

His grandfather, , was the court painter in Baden and his mother, Marie (1852-1889), was a portrait painter. His father, Viktor, was a doctor, so he initially studied medicine and philosophy in Munich, from 1902 to 1904, then spent five years in Paris, where he was a student of Lucien Simon. While there, he devoted himself primarily to landscape painting, under the influence of Paul C√©zanne. With his friend, Jules Pascin, he travelled to Belgium and Holland. Later study trips took him to Northern and Southern France, then to Vienna, Budapest and Stockholm. In 1910, he stayed briefly in Berlin, then continued his travels; this time to Engadin (near Munich), the Tegernsee and Italy, where he lived with his friend, Hans Purrmann. Upon returning to Germany, he lived in Berlin; creating book illustrations and portraits of celebrities, many of which were featured in the satirical magazine Simplicissimus.

History =Early versions (1958-1965)= The first Sunday afternoon broadcasts of its kind occurred in 1958 when, CBS added a Sunday Game of the Week. Two years later, NBC launched their own Sunday telecasts to go with their Saturday afternoon Game of the Week broadcasts. NBC's Sunday afternoon telecasts would last through the end of the 1964 season. In 1962, CBS dropped the Sunday baseball Game of the Week once the NFL season started, dropping the option clause for affiliates to carry baseball or football in place since 1957. =ABC's Sunday afternoon coverage (1977-1987)= In , the start of ABC's Monday Night Baseball coverage was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing Sunday Afternoon Baseball games in September. ABC also had a clause where they could air a game the last day of the regular season if it had playoff implications, such as in 1987 in regards to the Detroit Tigers' American League East pennant chase against the Toronto Blue Jays. However, in 1986, ABC did do a number of early season Sunday afternoon games before they went into Monday Night Baseball. ABC's contract was further modified prior to the season, with the network airing just five Monday Night Baseball telecasts in June of that year, followed by Sunday Afternoon Baseball in August and September. ABC did Sunday afternoon games late in the season in order to fulfill the number of games in the contract and to not interfere with Monday Night Football. In , ABC planned to increase coverage to 10 Monday night games and eight Sunday afternoon games, but the players' strike that year ended up reducing the network's schedule to three Monday night and seven Sunday afternoon telecasts. On April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC agreed to terms of a six-year television package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks continued to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC televised the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC televised the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return. The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. ABC was contracted to televise 20 prime time regular season games a year in addition to other games (the aforementioned Sunday afternoon games). During the 1986 season, Don Drysdale did play-by-play ABC's Sunday afternoon games, which aired until July, when Monday Night Baseball began. Al Michaels did the main Sunday game usually with Jim Palmer, while Drysdale and Johnny Bench did the backup contests. No Sunday afternoon baseball games were telecast nationally in and . =Sunday afternoon games on CBS (1990-1991)= CBS initially did not want to start their 1990 coverage until after the network had aired that year's NBA Finals (which was the last time CBS aired the Finals before the NBA's move to NBC). Therefore, only 12 regular season telecasts were scheduled The broadcasts would have been each Saturday from June 16 through August 25 and a special Sunday telecast on the weekend of August 11‚Äì12 (the New York Yankees against the Oakland Athletics in Oakland on both days). Ultimately, four more telecasts were added ‚Äì two in April and two on the last two Saturdays of the season. On Sunday, May 5, 1991, CBS broadcast games involving Cleveland at Oakland (with Jack Buck and Tim McCarver on the call) and Boston at the Chicago White Sox (with Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat on the call). And then on Sunday, July 14 of that year, Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat called a game in Anaheim between the New York Yankees and California Angels. =TBS's national package (2008‚Äìpresent)= During the regular season, TBS broadcasts a weekly game nationally on Sunday afternoons, under the title Sunday MLB on TBS. These games are not exclusive to TBS and are blacked out in local markets, to protect the stations that hold the local broadcast rights to the games. In the affected areas, simulcasts of programming from sister network HLN air in place of the games. Under the deal, TBS can show an alternate game in those markets, but the network has elected not to do so thus far. Despite initial reports that TBS would carry games on Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day, these holiday games are not part of the contract. For many years, games on these holidays were shown on ESPN, but that network has discontinued them, with the occasional exception of when they fall into the regular Sunday/Monday/Wednesday night slots. TBS released a partial schedule of its inaugural slate of Sunday games on February 27, 2008. More games would be added as the season progressed, generally two weeks before each telecast date. TBS has the second pick of game after ESPN. Consequently, due to its non-exclusivity, highlights of a scheduled game that aired on MLB on TBS are not shown on the ESPN baseball highlight show Baseball Tonight, nor are live simulcasts and highlights of the said game on the MLB.TV subscription service; instead local broadcasts of the scheduled game are shown. However, highlights of an MLB on TBS game did air on the MLB on Fox weekly program This Week in Baseball (until it was canceled in 2011), as well as MLB Tonight on the MLB Network.

The battle ended in Ottoman victory, and was most notable for the death of nine members of the ruling House of Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, including Joko Petroviƒá- Njego≈°, brother of the prince-bishop Petar II and Stevan Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, brother of Grand Duke Mirko.Milutin Tomiƒá ‚Äì Ban crnogorski Novica Ceroviƒá Background After the rise of Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° to power in the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro, members of Grahovo tribe, lead by vojvoda Jakov Dakoviƒá refused to pay hara√ß to the Ottoman authorities and joined the rest of Montenegrins in guerrila warfare in Ottoman-controlled Herzegovina, expressing the desire to unite with Montenegro.Milutin Tomiƒá ‚Äì Ban crnogorski Novica Ceroviƒá In response, Ali-pa≈°a Rizvanbegoviƒá, vizier of Herzegovina, attacked Grahovo in 1836 and occupied the town. Battle The battle that ensued took place when a band of around 300 young men led by Joko Petroviƒá- Njego≈°, arrived at Grahovo and decided to attack the Ottoman army without waiting for reinforcements. The Ottomans retreated at first, and then ambushed the Montenegrins near the ƒåelina stream (ƒåelinski potok), resulting with Ottoman victory and 70 Montenegrin casualties, including nine members of the House of Petroviƒá-Njego≈°, including the Prince-Bishop's teenage brother. Stojan Karad≈æiƒá ‚Äì Grahovska bitka, dolazak Smail-age ƒåengiƒáa u Drobnjak i njegovo ubistvo na Mljetiƒçku Aftermath Four years after the Montenegrin defeat at Grahovo, seeking revenge for the death of his brother, Njego≈° plotted the assassination of Smail-aga with the assistance of the local Christians from Herzegovina who lived on the territory under Smail-aga‚Äôs control. Njego≈° ordered a Montenegrin tribal leader, Novica Ceroviƒá, to ambush Smail-aga ƒåengiƒá, the Ottoman commander who was responsible for killing Njego≈°'s brother Joko. In late September 1840, Montenegrins attracted ƒåengiƒá and his army deep into their territory, organized an ambush and murdered them by attacking their camp during the night. The assault occurred in the village of Mljetiƒçak, north of Nik≈°iƒá. In the ensuing clash, Smail-aga was shot and killed, after which his severed head was brought to Cetinje. As a sign of his gratitude, Njego≈° made Ceroviƒá a senator.

Born and raised in North Dakota, she entered Annunciation Monastery in 1959, at age 19. She began working at the Benedictine-sponsored Mary College in 1963 and served as its president from 1978 to 2009. Under Welder, the college expanded to become the University of Mary. She received North Dakota's highest honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award, in 2004. Early life and education A young Diane Welder (later Sister Thomas Welder) pictured in her St. Mary's Central High School photo (1958).Diane Marie Welder was born on April 27, 1940, in Linton, North Dakota, to Mary Ann (n√©e Kuhn) and Sebastian Welder. Her father died of a kidney condition in 1951; her mother became a Benedictine sister in 1968, after raising Welder and her siblings. Four of Welder's maternal aunts also joined religious orders. Welder attended Cathedral Elementary School and St. Mary's Central High School, Bismarck, North Dakota, graduating in 1958. She studied at the College of St. Benedict in Minnesota, where she discerned her vocation to religious life. Welder returned to Bismarck to enter the community of Benedictine nuns at Annunciation Monastery. The Benedictines founded Mary College in 1959; Welder was a member of their first freshman class. She was given the religious name \\"Sister Thomas\\" when she entered the novitiate. She made a religious profession in 1961 and a perpetual monastic profession in 1964. She completed a bachelor's degree at the College of St. Scholastica in 1963 and received a master's degree in music from Northwestern University in 1968.

A visitation, open to the public, was held for Welder on June 28, 2020, by the University of Mary, in conjunction with the Benedictine Sisters of Annunciation Monastery, in the Our Lady of the Annunciation Chapel on the University's campus. During the seven- hour visitation period, guests were invited to pray before the body of Welder while friends and community leaders read aloud continuously from the St. John's Bible the Gospels of Luke and John. Notable readers included Senator John Hoeven and former First Lady Mikey Hoeven,, former Governor Ed Schafer and former First Lady Nancy Schafer, among many others. At the end of the visitation, the Sisters of Annunciation Monastery led a vigil with Evening Prayer (or Vespers), after which Governor Doug Burgum offered a reflection.

Born in Turnu Severin, his family was of Aromanian descent. They had settled in the town around 1830, but kept Austrian citizenship until 1906. Another account suggests the family were Serbs who had settled in the Banat.Ioan Scurtu, Istoria rom√¢nilor √Æn timpul celor patru regi (1866-1947), p. 167. Bucharest: Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, 2004 After attending primary school in his native city, Franasovici went to Saint Sava National College in Bucharest, graduating in 1900. He graduated from the Law faculty of Bucharest University in 1904. The following year, he was named judge's assistant for the Bal»ô district. In 1906, he became a lawyer at the Turnu Severin city hall, as well as state's attorney for Mehedin»õi County.Grigore and »òerbu, p. 259 Initially a member of the Conservative Party, he defected to Take Ionescu‚Äôs new Conservative-Democratic Party in 1908. He served as an officer in World War I. After the war, he entered the National Liberal Party (PNL) as part of its younger wing, opposed to the BrƒÉtianu family‚Äôs domination. Franasovici was first elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1919. In 1922, Franasovici was named general secretary in the Interior Ministry. He was undersecretary of state in 1923-1924 and 1927-1928. In the early 1930s, King Carol II exacerbated divisions within the PNL by encouraging a faction led by Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu, Ion Incule»õ and Franasovici, who saw a chance to depose VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu and achieve power. He was Minister of Public Works from November 1933 to November 1937. In January 1934, after King Carol dismissed the cabinet of Constantin Angelescu, the young Liberals proposed Franasovici as Prime Minister. The king agreed, but Franasovici declined, claiming it would be inappropriate for the head of government to have received Romanian citizenship only as an adult. Instead, he proposed TƒÉtƒÉrescu; the king accepted.Grigore and »òerbu, p. 260 By 1937, Franasovici was a prominent member of the royal camarilla. That November, although TƒÉt«érescu had other candidates in mind, he was named Interior Minister upon the insistence of Dinu BrƒÉtianu. The appointment was seconded by camarilla colleague Gabriel Marinescu. The ministry traditionally grew in importance at election time, due to its repressive capabilities. At the time, an election was approaching. Franasovici was presented to the public as a choice who would guarantee the integrity of the vote. He had a conciliatory attitude, particularly toward the Iron Guard, whose reprisals he greatly feared. During the campaign, the ministry used the police to block opposition activity, at times using teargas. TƒÉtƒÉrescu lost the election, ending Franasovici's brief stint as Interior Minister. He then served as ambassador to Poland (1938-1939) and France (1939-1940). In July 1945, he became ambassador to Switzerland. The following February, he was sent to London as ambassador. He attended the Paris peace conference.Grigore and »òerbu, p. 261 In November 1947, he resigned from the diplomatic service and went into exile. The following February, the new communist regime stripped him of his citizenship. He died in Paris. Franasovici‚Äôs wife was named Mary. Her mother‚Äôs first husband, Mary‚Äôs father, was one Filipescu; the mother later married Alexandru VƒÉitoianu, a future general. Mary and Franasovici were married after World War I. According to the memoirs of Constantin Argetoianu, the young politician was motivated by the fact that he had no property, while she owned an estate at R√¢mnicu SƒÉrat. He adds: ‚Äúeven before the marriage she was a slut, indeed a disgusting slut. She clung to Richard, creating a scene whenever he came to see her, yelled and managed to faint‚Äù. Franasovici, whom he nicknames Richard C≈ìur de Cochon (‚ÄúRichard the Pig-Heart‚Äù), would often go for advice to Alexandru Averescu. Once, Argetoianu was present when the two men were discussing Mary, who ‚Äúwas dying‚Äù. The latter, a doctor, advised Franasovici to ‚Äúgive her a sound beating, sir, it‚Äôll pass right away‚Äù. Upon hearing this advice, Mary got up and spat upon Argetoianu.Constantin Argetoianu (ed. Stelian Neagoe), Memorii pentru cei de m√¢ine, vol. V, pp. 106-07. Bucharest: Editura Humanitas, 1995.
