They are the main conduits for redistribution of approximately 48% of the Swedish GDP in the form of taxed income.  Family policy  The Swedish family policy has gone through a series of reforms. In the first place, the family policy aimed to encourage Swedish young people to marry and build their families. The whole family policy consists of three parts: parental benefits, child allowance and public daycare. = Parental benefit = Swedish families receive up to 480 days of paid parental leave (16 months), \\"f√∂r√§ldrapenning\\", with optional another three months unpaid leave. The policy regulates that each parent must take at least two months of leave, but in reality, some fathers do not take the leave at all; in this case, according to the \\"use it or lose it\\" basis, the parental leave time will drop from 16 months to 14 months. Apart from this, fathers receive additional 10 days of leave after the birth of a child. The parental leave can be used separately and partially of a day, but must be used before the child turns to eight years old. Parents are paid around 80 per cent of their pay in the first 390 days, and in the remaining 90 days, they will receive a flat rate of SEK 180 per day, which is also the rate for unemployed parents during the whole parental leave. Parents are entitled to up to 120 days to take care of their sick children every year. There is also a childcare allowance, \\"v√•rdbidrag\\", to enable parents to stay home and care for children with long-term illnesses. The parental leave in Sweden is job protected, which means parents who take the leave have the right to return to the same employer to the same or similar position. Apart from paid leave, parents also receive reimbursement (whole or partial) of hospital care, treatment and transportation related to childbirth. = Child allowance = The child allowance in Sweden started from the General Child Allowance in 1948. Parents in Sweden receive cash benefits to ease the burden of raising children who are under 16 years old, \\"barnbidrag\\". Generally, Swedish parents receive a flat rate child allowance of SEK 1050 per month for one child, which is tax-exempt. If the family have more than one child qualified to the child allowance, the family receive SEK 1050 more per child with additional \\"large family supplement\\", \\"flerbarnstill√§gg\\". For example, a family with 4 children under 16 will receive SEK 4200 child allowance and SEK 1614 large family supplement per month, totaling SEK 5814 per month. This child allowance is financed by the central government's budget and parents do not need to apply for the allowance, it is paid automatically. Apart from the child allowance, there are other allowances available for families with children. Families with children that pay over SEK 1400 for housing per month will receive a state-rent housing allowance, the level of which is determined by the number of children, the income of the family and the size and rent of the housing. But the income ceiling is set rather high, so that even a family with income well above average is entitled to receive house allowance. For families with disabled children, they will also receive allowance for car, care and hiring personal assistants. = Public day care = Public day care in Sweden are for children under 7 years old. The daycare centers are run by local municipalities under the guidance of central government. Most municipal preschools are open 10~12 hours a day to take care of children whose parents work full-time; there are also nighttime daycare centers for parents who work at night. \\"After the parents apply for placement at a preschool in the municipality where they live, the child is offered a vacancy based on that municipality's queue and admission rules.\\" The reform in 2007 made the daycare more affordable, EU/EEA citizens only need to pay a reduced fee for a full-time preschool. Apart from public daycare, there are also cooperatives run by parents, private child care facilities and family daycare; minders are hired by local municipalities to take care of children in their house.Ferrarini, Tommy & Duvander, Ann-Zofie & Countries, Nordic. (2009). Swedish Family Policy controversial reform of a success story. However, the public daycare is absolutely the majority. During 1965-1980, the number of child care facilities increased tenfold. Today, over 3/4 of children aged 1~5 go to public supported daycare centers.  Housing allowance  Families with children, and people below 29 years of age may be eligible to receive a housing allowance, \\"bostadsbidrag\\". The amount depends on income, the size of the family, housing costs and house size. At most it is 1,300 SEK.  Benefits for ill and disabled  Working people are entitled to sick pay when ill. The first 14 days (except the first day off) are paid by the employer, the rest by F√∂rs√§kringskassan. If an employee's ability to work is permanently reduced, disability payments may be made. If you need time- consuming assistance in your everyday life to be able to work or study due to illness or disability you can obtain disability allowance, \\"handikappers√§ttning\\". If you have a substantial and permanent disability where you need assistance with mealtimes, washing, clothing and communicating with others, you can receive an attendance allowance, \\"assistansers√§ttning\\", to pay for an assistant. If you have great difficulties in getting about on your own, or in using public transport due to a permanent disability you can obtain an allowance to purchase a car, make alterations to a car, and to take a driving licence.  Support for the elderly  If you have worked in Sweden and earned a taxable work income, you will be entitled to Swedish old age pension, at the earliest from the age of 61 years. The levels depend on your income and how long you have worked. There is also a guarantee pension which you are entitled to if you have lived for at least three years in Sweden if you have had no or low income. Elderly can also receive housing supplements or maintenance support. The levels of these depend on your needs.  Welfare  If you have no or low income you can apply for welfare from your local municipality. The municipality will look at your economic situation to determine if you should receive welfare or not. The welfare should be enough to cover things like housing, food, clothing and telephone.

Early life and influences Originally from Chelmsford, Essex, England, Daniel de Bourg was influenced by the videos of Michael Jackson to pursue dance at the age of four. By the time that de Bourg was eleven, he had been admitted to study at the exclusive Royal Ballet School, graduating top of his class with his final solo performance. Although dance was his primary interest, as a teen he was also fronting bands. He left school when given the opportunity to dance for the Rambert Dance Company, performing as a featured dancer all over the world. It was at the suggestion of a friend that heard him singing that de Bourg found himself in the position for a career in music.Demalon, Tom. Biography: Daniel Debourg \\"AllMusic.com\\". Accessed 16 September 2013. Music career Influenced by artists such as Prince and Stevie Wonder, de Bourg did not take to a singing career straight away. Dedicated to dance, de Bourg's early interest in singing was rediscovered after a knee injury caused some time out from his dance career.Ray, Ian.

Accessed 4 January 2012. de Bourg turned his hand to songwriting; recorded by songstress Jamelia in 2000, his song \\"Money\\" reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart., p.265 Remembering de Bourg's musical talents, he was encouraged by a friend to create several demos of his own singing. These attracted the interest of DreamWorks scout Robbie Robertson. de Bourg was introduced to then in house producers Tim & Bob and subsequently signed to the label and the duo produced his debut album, Tell the World. The high- production album, released in 2002, launched the single \\"I Need an Angel\\", which hit number 30 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In 2007, de Bourg auditioned for the fourth series of The X Factor and reached the final twelve acts to sing in the live rounds of the competition. He was mentored by Louis Walsh, but was eliminated by the judges on 27 October 2007 after Simon Cowell prevented a 'deadlock' and cast the deciding vote. The official count of votes, published some time after the show had finished, revealed de Bourg received the most votes on week 1 and was 100,000 votes ahead of the contestant that he faced in the sing-off before he left the show. In 2008, UK artist DJ Ironik presented de Bourg on his album, No Point In Wasting Tears. In 2010, The DDB Mixtape Vol. 1: The Prelude, a mixture of de Bourg's most popular covers and original material, received a nomination for 'Best R&B; Mixtape 2010' and went on to win the award at The Official Mixtape Awards in early 2011. He went on to win the same accolade another two years in a row with 'The DDB Mixtape Vol. 2 : The Bridge' in 2011 and 'Outro' in 2012. In 2013, Daniel released his album, London Bread. featuring production from Drake and Lil Wayne hit maker, Boi-1da. The album hit the top 20 on iTunes in 21 countries in its first week of release.

Morawetz's research was mainly in the study of the partial differential equations governing fluid flow, particularly those of mixed type occurring in transonic flow.Science Lives: Cathleen Morawetz Simons Foundation She was professor emerita at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the New York University, where she had also served as director from 1984 to 1988. She was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1998. Childhood Morawetz's father, John Lighton Synge, nephew of John Millington Synge, was an Irish mathematician, specializing in the geometry of general relativity. Her mother also studied mathematics for a time. Her uncle was Edward Hutchinson Synge who is credited as the inventor of the Near-field scanning optical microscope. Her childhood was split between Ireland and Canada. Both her parents were supportive of her interest in mathematics and science, and it was a woman mathematician, Cecilia Krieger, who had been a family friend for many years who later encouraged Morawetz to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Morawetz said her father was influential in stimulating her interest in mathematics, but he wondered whether her studying mathematics would be wise (suggesting they might fight like the Bernoulli brothers). Education A graduate of the University of Toronto in 1945, Morawetz received her master's degree in 1946 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Morawetz got a job at New York University where she edited Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves by Richard Courant and Kurt Otto Friedrichs. She earned her Ph.D. in 1951 at New York University, with a thesis on the stability of a spherical implosion, under the supervision of Kurt Otto Friedrichs. Her thesis was entitled Contracting Spherical Shocks Treated by a Perturbation Method Career After earning her doctorate, Morawetz spent a year as a research associate at MIT before returning to work as a research associate at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, for five more years. During this time she had no teaching requirements and could focus purely on research. She published work on a variety of topics in applied mathematics including viscosity, compressible fluids and transonic flows. Even if an aircraft remains subsonic, the air flowing around the wing can reach supersonic velocity. The mix of air at supersonic and subsonic velocity creates shock waves that can slow the airplane. Turning to the mathematics of transonic flow, she showed that specially designed shockless airfoils could not, in fact, prevent shocks. Shocks developed in response to even small perturbations, such as a gust of wind or an imperfection in a wing.Chang, Kenneth, Cathleen Morawetz, 94; used math in study of motion, New York Times, August 13, 2017, p. 18 This discovery opened up the problem of developing a theory for a flow with shocks. Subsequently, the shocks she predicted mathematically now have been observed in experiments as air flows around the wing of a plane. In 1957 she became an assistant professor at Courant. At this point she began to work more closely with her colleagues publishing important joint papers with Peter Lax and Ralph Phillips on the decay of solutions to the wave equation around a star shaped obstacle. She continued with important solo work on the wave equation and transonic flow around a profile until she was promoted to full professor by 1965. At this point her research expanded to a variety of problems including papers on the Tricomi equation the nonrelativistic wave equation including questions of decay and scattering. Her first doctoral student, Lesley Sibner, was graduated in 1964. In the 1970s she worked on questions of scattering theory and the nonlinear wave equation. She proved what is now known as the Morawetz Inequality. She died on August 8, 2017 in New York City.Paid death notice The New York Times, Aug 10, 2017 Honors In 1980 Morawetz won a Lester R. Ford Award. In 1981, she became the first woman to deliver the Gibbs Lecture of The American Mathematical Society, and in 1982 presented an Invited Address at a meeting of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. She received honorary degrees from Eastern Michigan University in 1980, Brown University, and Smith College in 1982, and Princeton in 1990. In 1983 and in 1988, she was selected as a Noether Lecturer. She was named Outstanding Woman Scientist for 1993 by the Association for Women in Science. In 1995, she became the second woman elected to the office of president of the American Mathematical Society. In 1996, she was awarded an honorary ScD degree by Trinity College Dublin, where her father JL Synge had been a student and later a faculty member.Honorary Degree Recipients 1972‚Äì2018 Trinity College Dublin In 1998 she was awarded the National Medal of Science; she was the first woman to receive the medal for work in mathematics.

He was known for his interpretations of Mozart operas and for his support of contemporary music. Life and career Pritchard was born in Walthamstow, Essex, to a musical family. His father, Albert Edward Pritchard, was a violinist with the London Symphony Orchestra. The young Pritchard was educated at the Monoux School and studied violin, piano, and conducting in Italy.Ponsonby, Robert, \\"Pritchard, Sir John Michael (1918‚Äì1989)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 November 2007 Pritchard, as a conscientious objector, refused to serve in the Second World War, but was in any case unfit on medical grounds. In 1943 he took over the semi-professional Derby String Orchestra and was its principal conductor until 1951. He joined the music staff of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1947 and was appointed chorus master in 1949. He remained associated with Glyndebourne for most of his career, as conductor, music counsellor (from 1963), principal conductor (1968) and musical director (1969‚Äì78). Beyond Glyndebourne, Pritchard appeared with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, at Edinburgh in 1952 (deputising for Ernest Ansermet, who was ill). He made his d√©but at the Royal Opera House in 1951 and at the Vienna State Opera in 1952. He appeared regularly with the Vienna Symphony (1953‚Äì55).Goodwin, Noel. \\"John Pritchard\\", Grove Music Online, accessed 4 November 2007 For Glyndebourne in this period he conducted Mozart's Idomeneo and Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos at the Edinburgh festivals of 1953 and 1954 and Rossini's La Cenerentola at the Berlin Festival, a performance described by the Dictionary of National Biography as 'a triumph'. In 1957, Pritchard was appointed principal conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic where he launched the Musica Viva series showcasing contemporary music. His success in Liverpool led to his appointment as musical director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1962‚Äì66). Freelancing after leaving the LPO, he conducted concerts in Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Philadelphia and the Far East, and opera in Buenos Aires, Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Salzburg, Florence, and Munich.

Vasastaden, or colloquially Vasastan, (Swedish for \\"Vasa town\\") is a 3.00 km¬≤ large city district in central Stockholm, Sweden, being a part of Norrmalm borough. With 58,458 (2006) inhabitants it is the third most populous, and the second most densely populated (17,220/km¬≤) district in Stockholm. The major parks in Vasastaden are Vasaparken and Observatorielunden near the centre and Vanadislunden and Bellevueparken in the north.  History  = Vasastaden proper = Surbrunnsgatan to the east. The city district, most likely named after the street Vasagatan, in its turn named after King Gustav Vasa in 1885, was still a peripheral part of the city in the early 1880s. Before the end of that decade, however, some 150 buildings had been built and only the properties along Odengatan remained vacant. The expansion was preceded by a city plan established in 1879, a slightly more modest edition of the 1866 intentions of city planner Albert Lindhagen, in its turn largely a continuation north of an original 17th-century plan. Like the Baroque plan, the new plan took little or no account of local topographic variations, and where the two failed to reconcile, sites were simply set aside as parks or for major structures such as the Sabbatsberg Hospital.Andersson, Stockholms √•rsringar, pp 65-67 Compared to central Stockholm, streets were widened to 18 metres, except for the main east-west-bound street Odengatan which was made 30 metres wide and adorned with plantings after continental prototypes. In accordance with construction charters from the 1870s, building corners where filleted and building heights adopted to street width and limited to five floors -- embellishing proportions intended to bring light and air into the urban space. The Neo-Renaissance plaster architecture of the middle class residential buildings in southern Vasastaden is highly reminiscent of the Ringstra√üe in Vienna; the ground floors are dominated by horizontal elements with columns and pilasters above, while accentuated cornices closes the vertical compositions. Later architects failed to appreciate these Neo-Renaissance buildings and freed many of them of most of their decorations. = Sibirien = The north-eastern part of the district is called Sibirien (Siberia in English). The area borders √ñstermalm but has historically been a stronghold for the working class. The origin of the name Sibirien (Eng. Siberia) originates from a time when the area was inhabited by the poor, who could not afford heating. People started to say that the area was \\"as cold and as far away as Siberia\\", hence the nickname. = Birkastaden = Birkastaden rising tall above Karlberg Palace. In the north-western corner of the district are eight blocks forming Birkastaden, named after the 9th century settlement Birka, sometimes called R√∂rstrandsomr√•det (the \\"R√∂rstrand Area\\") which forms the compact northern frontier of Stockholm's historical city centre. As described above, Lindhagen's original intentions for the elevated area was to keep it as a park featuring the 17th century avenue of Karlberg Palace. In the city plan of 1879, however, the area was divided into two large blocks, which on a request from the local landowner, porcelain factory R√∂rstrand, in 1886 were split up into smaller properties. This resulted in a new city plan which was adopted to local topographic variations and therefore features non-perpendicular street crossings.Andersson, pp 73-75 Few buildings were constructed before the start of the 20th century, but construction work soon boomed to culminate in 1905-06, speculation causing many buildings to change owners several times before their completion. Virtually all the buildings in Birkastaden are Art Nouveau, a result of both the brief construction period and the fact that some 50 buildings were designed by architects Dorph & H√∂√∂g, at the time the largest architectural practice in Northern Europe. The buildings of Birkastan features oriel windows, towers on the corners, rounded pediments and bright, plain plaster fa√ßades with thrifty decorations. As a result of speculation, the backyards are narrow, and many flats shadowy. From the start, however, Birkastan was a mixed area shared by both low and high income earners. = R√∂da bergen = Falugatan street in R√∂da Bergen. A doorway in R√∂da Bergen. R√∂da bergen (\\"Red Mountains\\"), the hilly area just north of Birkastan, was unsuitable for the regular and perpendicular street pattern envisaged for Vasastaden, but proved excellent for the new city planning ideals where the terrain was allowed to govern city plans. The plan for R√∂da Bergen was designed by P O Hallman, who during the 1910s also produced similar plans for L√§rkstaden inspired by the ideas of Austrian architect Camillo Sitte. His plan for R√∂da Bergen was adopted in 1909, but because of World War I most of these plans remained unrealised until the 1920s. In 1923 the plan, slightly modified by Sigurd Lewerentz, was finally established.Andersson, pp 109-111 The buildings facing the surrounding blocks are traditional 5-6 floors residential buildings forming a wall around R√∂da Bergen. From the monumental eastern entrance, an avenue (R√∂dabergsgatan) leads west to a round elevated space where a church was originally planned. Perpendicular to this avenue, the heavily trafficked Torsgatan cuts through the area. The blocks within R√∂da Bergen are limited to 2-3 floors and most of the backyards are open in one end, which allows for plenty of sun light and series of spaces appealing to the eye. Hallman's design was a sharp break with the contemporary narrow, dark, and often filthy backyards. In contrast to them, the involved architects -- including Bj√∂rn Hedwall, Paul Hedqvist, and Sven Wallander -- carefully detailed the fa√ßades and gables facing the interior with simple classical ornaments and warm red and yellow colours. Of the 2.500 flats in the area, many included novelties such as warm and cold water, WC, and even bath tubes, but most of them were small -- half of them was a single room with a kitchen or even less. = Atlas = One of the monumental stairways leading down to the Atlas Area. A door in Atlas. The area next to the Sankt Eriksbron bridge was until the turn of century 1900 a heavily industrial district. The Atlas Area, east of the bridge and named after industrial company Atlas AB whose workshops used to occupy the area, presents features unique to Stockholm. The plan for the area was passed in 1926 and construction works immediately followed. In contrast to the newly built R√∂da Bergen, much of which was built by HSB, the builders at Atlas were private entrepreneurs. While this resulted in a much criticized high exploitation, the city building committee in 1926 concluded the area could boast an intelligible order and a regularity the neighbouring R√∂rstrand Area still couldn't present notwithstanding recent redesign attempts.Andersson, pp 117-119 The most striking feature of Atlas is the level difference between the surrounding streets and the area itself. Like at R√∂da Bergen, the buildings delimiting Atlas form a coherent wall where the exterior fa√ßades are six floors tall while the interior fa√ßades are nine floors tall. The buildings inside the area are 5-6 floors, concealing the dark narrow backyards while separated by widened streets with plantations. The difference in level was solved by mean of monumental flights of stairs resulting in the tall porticoes leading into the area. The flats in Atlas were small -- 1-2 rooms and a kitchen -- and dark -- a result of exploitation and the wide building volumes -- but featured modernities such as central heating and bathrooms. The reduced classical ornamentation and the perpendicular plan has, however, given the area a monumentality which is characteristic for the National Romantic Swedish architecture of the 1920s. The contrast between the heavily trafficked surroundings streets and the calm interior of Atlas, brilliantly exposed through the large porticoes, still makes Atlas a popular area.

The town of Laverton is located at the western edge of the Great Victoria Desert, north-northeast of the state capital, Perth, and east-northeast of the town of Leonora, with an elevation of 461 m. About 20% of the population is of Aboriginal descent. The area is semi-arid, with a mean annual rainfall of . It is also quite warm, with mean daily maximum temperatures ranging from 17 ¬∞C (62 ¬∞F) in July to 36 ¬∞C (97 ¬∞F) in January. Laverton is the westernmost town on the Outback Way - a proposed highway which goes through the Northern Territory to Winton in outback Queensland. History A number of early explorers travelled over the Laverton area, including John Forrest, David Carnegie and Frank Hann. Gold was discovered in the British Flag area in 1896 and many prospectors and miners moved into the area. Among them was Dr Charles W. Laver, who became an enthusiastic supporter and promoter of the region. One of the most successful mines was Craiggiemore, and by 1897 a residential and business area known as British Flag had sprung up on the west side of the mine. In March 1898 a townsite was approved as Laverton, in honour of Laver. In 1899, the residents sought to have a townsite surveyed, but by then the original Craiggiemore location had become unsuitable, so a new site was chosen about three kilometres north of the original lots. The new site was surveyed in July 1899 and the town of Laverton gazetted in July 1900. By the late 1960s, Laverton was in decline, mainly because of the very low price of gold. In 1968 a Poseidon prospector Ken Shirley discovered nickel-bearing rocks at Windarra, 24 km northwest of Laverton. In 1969 Poseidon began drilling Windarra. In September rumours of a nickel strike prompted the Poseidon bubble. The deposit was developed by Western Mining and its partners into the Windarra Nickel Project, which mined and processed nickel ore from 1974 to 1991. Modern industry Gold mines in the Leonora - Laverton region Laverton is primarily a mining area. There are two major operating gold mines in the district: the Wallaby Mine near Granny Smith, owned and operated by Gold Fields, and the Sunrise Dam Gold Mine, owned and operated by AngloGold Ashanti. Both open pit and underground mining is conducted at these mines. The Murrin Murrin laterite nickel project is located 55 km to the west, midway between Laverton and Leonora. The area has a long history of pastoralism with sheep, cattle and goats, and a substantial area of land is used in this way. Demographics According to census results from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the population of the Laverton urban centre fell 23%, from 439 to 340 in the 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Over this same period, the population of Indigenous Australians decreased from 37.6% (165 people) to 20.8% (71 people) of the town. Climate Laverton has a semi-arid climate with hot summers and mild to cool winters.

This breed of terrier is also called the German Hunt Terrier. Description =Appearance= A typical appearance of a Jagdterrier is black and tan, with the tan being more of a rust colour on the muzzle and undercarriage. It can also be chocolate or liver brown with white markings although the white markings and the chocolate colouring should be avoided in breeding programs along with a brown nose. Black and tan/rust markings should be the goal. The breed standard calls for an animal that stands at the shoulders, with females weighing from , and males weighing from . The coat of a Jagdterrier can be either hairy, smooth or broken. All varieties do shed. The tail is normally (but not always) docked at 2/3 the natural length. =Temperament= Jagdterriers were developed to be all-round hunting dogs. Though often used for quarry that dens underground, especially badger, fox, and raccoon, Jagdterriers are also used to drive wild boar and rabbits out of thickets, and to blood track wounded animals, such as deer. Due to their intelligence and adaptability, Jagdterriers can make good pets, but it should be remembered that they are primarily a hunting dog with a strong prey drive. History Between the two World Wars, game managers in Germany were focused on getting rid of foreign or introduced species, and bringing back now-extinct species that figured prominently in the mythology of the nation. One of the pioneers of this peculiar quest was Lutz Heck, the curator of the Berlin Zoo, who went on to \\"back breed\\" primitive cattle and horses to \\"recreate\\" the extinct aurochs (the kind of wild cattle seen in the cave paintings at Lascaux, France) and the tarpan (a kind of primitive forest pony). Heck's interest in dogs was driven in part by his passion for hunting, and in part by nationalism that was mixed with a desire to see what could be done with selective breeding. Even as nationalism and an interest in genetic engineering were rising in Germany, terriers were also rising to the height of fashion in much of Europe and the United States. The Allied Terrier Show was taken over by Charles Crufts in 1886, and was the largest dog show in the world before World War I, while the first breed-specific dog publication anywhere was a magazine devoted to fox terriers. The Westminster Dog Show was begun in 1907, and the first winner was a fox terrier. A fox terrier won again in 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1915, 1916, and 1917. A fascination with terriers, fervent nationalism, and a propensity towards genetic engineering were braided together when Lutz Heck presented four black-and-tan Fell terriers‚Äîsimilar to what we now would call a Patterdale Terrier‚Äîto Carl Eric Gruenewald and Walter Zangenbert. Gruenewald was a \\"cynologist\\" (a self-styled dog man with an interest in genetics) and Zangenbert was a dedicated hunter with an interest in fox terriers. Gruenewald and Zangenbert added to their team Chief Forester R. Fiess and Dr. Herbert Lackner, men with land for a kennel, and the financial means to support it over a decade-long quest. An early problem was that the Black and Tan Terriers selected as the core breeding stock and deemed \\"ideal hunters\\" based on colour alone were, in fact, not all that great at hunting. As Gruenewald later wrote: :\\"We were glad to own fox terriers with the hunting color, and we hoped to use these four puppies successfully in breeding to establish a hunting fox terrier breed (jagdfoxterrier-stamm). From the viewpoint of hunting these four dogs were not bad, although they left much to desire. First we tried inbreeding, pairing brothers with sisters. But the results were not good. No wonder -- after all, the parents weren't real hunting dogs. The picture changed, though, when we bred our four 'originals' with our well-trained old hunting fox terriers. The beautiful dark color continued to be dominate. Dogs with a lot of the white color and spotted dogs were selected and eliminated from further breeding.\\" The breeding program for the Jagdterrier was massive in scale and unwavering in its selection criteria. At one point the men had 700 dogs in their kennels, and not a single dog was allowed to be placed outside of the kennel. Dogs that did not look the part, or which were deemed to be not of the quality desired, were culled (standard practice the world over until the 1960s). Early dogs were both smooth and rough coat, but the breeding program moved to get rid of smooth coats, and the coat of the final product can best be described as \\"slape coated\\"‚Äîa short, hard and wiry coat that sheds water and dirt while providing warmth in winter. After only 10 years time the dogs were breeding more-or-less true, with a Patterdale-like appearance, albeit with more red on the undercarriage. The German Hunting Terrier Club (Deutscher Jagdterrier-Club) was founded in 1926, and the dog was warmly embraced in part because it fit well with the rising nationalistic sentiment within Germany at the time. In 1938, a German by the name of Max Thiel, Sr. bought his first Jagdterrier. Thiel hunted with this dog for only a few years before the start of World War II. During the war Thiel lost his dogs, but after the war he settled in Bavaria and purchased two female dogs, Asta and Naja. In 1951 Thiel moved to the US, bringing with him Naja. He soon sent for Asta, who was bred and shipped pregnant. In 1954, Armin Schwarz Sr., imported a \\"champion\\" sire named Axel, and a few more litters were promulgated. In March 1956, nine Jadgterrier owners met in St. Louis, Missouri, and formed the Jagdterrier Club of America, with the expressed goal of getting the dog recognized by the American Kennel Club. In fact, the club did not prosper and eventually died out. The Jadgterrier did not become popular in the US for several reasons, not the least of which was that in the US very few people hunt fox to ground. In recent years, with the rise of interest in terrier work in the US, new lines of Jagdterriers have been imported to the US, but most are used for above-ground or barn work due to their size. For a Jadgterrier to do well working underground in the US, it has to be at the absolutely smallest end of the breed standard or even undersized. Many of the newer/later imports to the US are within the true FCI breed standard (correct size) and are being used successfully both above and below ground, with many reports of their offspring making exceptional hunting, flush and retrieval dogs both on land and in water. Today there are many hunters across the US adopting this courageous, intelligent breed as a hunt companion because of its versatility in various hunt disciplines and aim-to-please attitude.

With 71,802 inhabitants, it is one of the most populous districts in Stockholm. It is an extremely expensive area, having the highest housing prices in Sweden.  History  During the reign of the ruler of all of Scandinavia, king Eric of Pomerania in the early 15th century, a royal cowshed/barn was erected on the lands of the village V√§dla. Since the town of Stockholm had grown and started to encroach on the borders of that village, there were many complaints about animals causing damage in the town. In the 17th century, the inhabitants of Stockholm were allowed to keep their cattle there. In 1639, parts of the allocated land for the cowshed/barn were put up for development. In 1672 the eastern part became a military exercise field. For the following 200 years, it was the home of some higher officers, but most inhabitants were poor. A new town plan presented around 1880 implied a grid of streets and avenues that was to become lined with elegant houses, with 4‚Äì6 floors. When the plan was implemented, it ended the rustic appearance of the district. The old official name \\"Ladug√•rdslandet\\" (literal meaning \\"The Barn Land\\") was replaced with \\"√ñstermalm\\" (literal meaning Eastern Outer City). Since the Crown had been the owner of parts of the district for centuries, a number of official buildings, museums and higher public educational institutions were located in the area.

Parallel coordinates are a common way of visualizing and analyzing high- dimensional datasets. To show a set of points in an n-dimensional space, a backdrop is drawn consisting of n parallel lines, typically vertical and equally spaced. A point in n-dimensional space is represented as a polyline with vertices on the parallel axes; the position of the vertex on the i-th axis corresponds to the i-th coordinate of the point. This visualization is closely related to time series visualization, except that it is applied to data where the axes do not correspond to points in time, and therefore do not have a natural order. Therefore, different axis arrangements may be of interest.  History  Parallel coordinates were often said to be invented by Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne (fr) in 1885, but even though the words \\"Coordonn√©es parall√®les\\" appear in the book title this work has nothing to do with the visualization techniques of the same name; the book only describes a method of coordinate transformation. But even before 1885, parallel coordinates were used, for example in Henry Gannetts \\"General Summary, Showing the Rank of States, by Ratios, 1880\\", or afterwards in Henry Gannetts \\"Rank of States and Territories in Population at Each Census, 1790-1890\\" in 1898. They were popularised again 79 years later by Alfred Inselberg in 1959 and systematically developed as a coordinate system starting from 1977. Some important applications are in collision avoidance algorithms for air traffic control (1987‚Äî3 USA patents), data mining (USA patent), computer vision (USA patent), Optimization, process control, more recently in intrusion detection and elsewhere. Higher dimensions On the plane with an xy cartesian coordinate system, adding more dimensions in parallel coordinates (often abbreviated -coords or PCP) involves adding more axes. The value of parallel coordinates is that certain geometrical properties in high dimensions transform into easily seen 2D patterns. For example, a set of points on a line in n-space transforms to a set of polylines in parallel coordinates all intersecting at n ‚àí 1 points. For n = 2 this yields a point-line duality pointing out why the mathematical foundations of parallel coordinates are developed in the projective rather than euclidean space. A pair of lines intersects at a unique point which has two coordinates and, therefore, can correspond to a unique line which is also specified by two parameters (or two points). By contrast, more than two points are required to specify a curve and also a pair of curves may not have a unique intersection. Hence by using curves in parallel coordinates instead of lines, the point line duality is lost together with all the other properties of projective geometry, and the known nice higher-dimensional patterns corresponding to (hyper)planes, curves, several smooth (hyper)surfaces, proximities, convexity and recently non- orientability. The goal is to map n-dimensional relations into 2D patterns. Hence, parallel coordinates is not a point-to-point mapping but rather a nD subset to 2D subset mapping, there is no loss of information. Note: even a point in nD is not mapped into a point in 2D, but to a polygonal line‚Äîa subset of 2D. Statistical considerations Representative sample for parallel coordinates. When used for statistical data visualisation there are three important considerations: the order, the rotation, and the scaling of the axes. The order of the axes is critical for finding features, and in typical data analysis many reorderings will need to be tried. Some authors have come up with ordering heuristics which may create illuminating orderings. The rotation of the axes is a translation in the parallel coordinates and if the lines intersected outside the parallel axes it can be translated between them by rotations. The simplest example of this is rotating the axis by 180 degrees. Scaling is necessary because the plot is based on interpolation (linear combination) of consecutive pairs of variables. Therefore, the variables must be in common scale, and there are many scaling methods to be considered as part of data preparation process that can reveal more informative views. A smooth parallel coordinate plot is achieved with splines. In the smooth plot, every observation is mapped into a parametric line (or curve), which is smooth, continuous on the axes, and orthogonal to each parallel axis. This design emphasizes the quantization level for each data attribute.  Reading  Inselberg () made a full review of how to visually read out parallel coords' relational patterns. When most lines between two parallel axis are somewhat parallel to each other, it suggests a positive relationship between these two dimensions. When lines cross in a kind of superposition of X-shapes, it's a negative relationship. When lines cross randomly or are parallel, it shows there is no particular relationship.  Limitations  In parallel coordinates, each axis can have at most two neighboring axes (one on the left, and one on the right). For a d-dimensional data set, at most d-1 relationships can be shown at a time. In time series visualization, there exists a natural predecessor and successor; therefore in this special case, there exists a preferred arrangement. However, when the axes do not have a unique order, finding a good axis arrangement requires the use of heuristics and experimentation. In order to explore more complex relationships, axes must be reordered. By arranging the axes in 3-dimensional space (however, still in parallel, like nails in a nail bed), an axis can have more than two neighbors in a circle around the central attribute, and the arrangement problem gets easier (for example by using a minimum spanning tree). A prototype of this visualization is available as extension to the data mining software ELKI. However, the visualization is harder to interpret and interact with than a linear order.  Software  While there are a large number of papers about parallel coordinates, there are only few notable software publicly available to convert databases into parallel coordinates graphics. Notable software are ELKI, GGobi, Mondrian, Orange and ROOT. Libraries include Protovis.js, D3.js provides basic examples. D3.Parcoords.js (a D3-based library) specifically dedicated to parallel coordinates graphic creation has also been published.

Technical Pan is an almost panchromatic black-and- white film that was produced by Kodak. While it can reproduce the visible light spectrum, it leans to the red, and so unfiltered outdoor shots render blues, most notably the sky, with additional darkening and reds with some lightening. It was generally used as a very slow film, rated at EI 25 or even 16, although it could be rated at up to EI 320 with a distinct loss of tonal range and a bunching of shadow and highlight detail. This film has unmatched fine grain, especially when rated at a low speed, and makes excellent enlargements while preserving fine details. Kodak stopped selling it in 2004. It has not been replaced by a film (from any manufacturer) with its characteristics. Technical Pan is a microfilm emulsion that was made panchromatic through the addition of sensitizing dyes, as is the case with all panchromatic films. If developed in a general-purpose developer such as D-76, Tech Pan displays extreme contrast. It becomes a pictorial film when developed in a very low-contrast developer. The film can be developed at home, mainly by using the chemical mixture Technidol, which Kodak sold for that purpose alone. Other two-bath \\"split\\" developers have been used on Tech Pan as well as highly dilute developers such as Agfa's Rodinal. To achieve exact results, small-tank development was often the preferred process and \\"clip testing\\" (developing a small piece cut from a roll to test developing times and dilutions) was usually done. Like other panchromatic films, it must be developed in darkness. When the film was discontinued, Kodak revealed that none had been made for many years nor could any more be made because the coating line had been shut down and many of the materials used to make it had been discontinued,KODAK PROFESSIONAL Technical Pan Film and that it was still on the market only due to a large roll being found in frozen storage. The film was created for the military and was no longer required for that purpose. Consequently, Kodak cut the roll into commercially viable formats and continued to sell it. Unexposed Technical Pan is now quite valuable. Tech Pan or Technipan, as it is often known, was very popular among some professional photographers and astronomers, as it is capable of recording extremely fine detail, and its sensitivity curve extended much further into the red than most films. In particular, it was very sensitive to light emitted by hydrogen at 656.28 nm (H-alpha), which made it very useful for a wide range of astronomical imaging.

Clive Standen plays Viesturs in the 2015 remake of Everest telling of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster. Early life Viesturs was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, of Latvian and German descent. He was raised in Rockford, Illinois, Viesturs moved to Seattle, Washington in 1977 to attend the University of Washington. It was here that he began his mountaineering career on the slopes of Mount Rainier. Viesturs graduated from the University of Washington in 1981 with a BS in zoology and worked as a guide for Rainier Mountaineering. He later obtained a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Washington State University. Mountain climbing career His interest in the Himalayas was sparked in high school by reading Maurice Herzog's account of the first climb of Annapurna, titled Annapurna. After climbing Kangchenjunga in 1989, Mount Everest in 1990 and K2 in 1992, Viesturs became an international mountain guide and was sponsored for full-time mountaineering. He served as a guide for Rob Hall's Adventure Consultants company during their 1995 Everest expedition. Viesturs climbs with Finnish partner Veikka Gustafsson. Viesturs has assisted other mountaineers several times. In 1992, he and fellow American Scott Fischer brought down French climber Chantal Mauduit, suffering from exhaustion, after her summit of K2. Viesturs was in the IMAX climbing team during the 1996 Everest Disaster. He was featured in David Breashears' documentary film Everest (1998), and filming was delayed as a blizzard struck. The IMAX team postponed shooting and followed Viesturs up the mountain to aid the stranded climbers. The team ultimately decided to keep going, and summitted Everest on May 23, 1996. Viesturs was also featured in the Nova television documentary, Everest: The Death Zone (1998), in which he and Breashears climbed Everest to the summit, while undergoing physical and mental tests to record the effects of altitude on humans. In July 2003, Viesturs and a Kazakh team, headed by Denis Urubko, were instrumental in the rescue of French climber Jean-Christophe Lafaille from Broad Peak. Lafaille had developed high-altitude pulmonary edema and was unable to complete his descent. They coordinated a rescue attempt in the dark, and were able to get Lafaille safely off the mountain and helicoptered out for medical help. In 2005, Viesturs became the first American, and 12th person overall, to summit all 14 mountains over 8,000 meters (collectively known as the eight-thousanders). He is the fifth climber to do it without supplemental oxygen.

This included an initial order for three aircraft valued at ¬£4 million. Laker had placed this order directly with the manufacturer in 1966. He provided more than ¬£200,000 of his own money for the newly ordered aircraft's deposits and arranged for the remainder to be borrowed from a consortium of City banks led by Clydesdale Bank.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 106 He placed a follow-on order for a fourth aircraft to be delivered in 1968 and acquired another relatively new aircraft that was originally delivered to the failed British Eagle airline from Bahamas Airways in 1971.Laker: Another One-Eleven, Flight International, 20 July 1967, p. 91Fifth Laker One-Eleven, Flight International, 25 March 1971, p. 406\\"The Home Of Eagle\\" ... ‚Äî G-ATPK BAC1-11 Type 301AG c/n 034 These were the mainstay of the fleet for its short- and medium-haul charter operations to holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands for many years. New commercial developments The introduction of several new, short-haul jetliners into a small airline's fleet over a short time necessitated more efficient marketing. Laker Airways came up with a 30% discount offer to encourage tour operators to charter the airline's aircraft during the winter trough and a \\"time charter\\". The former helped create winter traffic to popular Mediterranean resorts while the latter gave tour operators financial incentives to charter an aircraft's capacity for an entire season.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 107Airline Profile: Number Thirty-Nine in the Series ‚Äì Court Line, Flight International, 19 March 1970, p. 439Airline Profile: Number Thirty-Nine in the Series ‚Äì Court Line, Flight International, 19 March 1970, p. 440 This ensured the fleet was fully used throughout the year, smoothing out the peaks and troughs that characterise charter airlines.

Each airline owned 50% of Gatwick Handling at its inception.Delta takes Gatwick Handling share, Flight International, 4 February 1984, p. 314 =Cost saving= Laker Airways pioneered cost-saving to reduce its engines' wear and tear, reduce fuel consumption, and achieve greater range than indicated by the manufacturers' range specifications.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 118 Reduced thrust take-off technique Laker Airways was first to use the reduced thrust take-off technique it had developed for the BAC One-Eleven. Reducing the BAC One- Eleven's take-off thrust reduced wear and tear of the Rolls-Royce Spey engines. This increased the time before overhaul, reducing costs and prolonging the engines' life. Rolls-Royce remarked that the Spey engines Laker Airways sent for overhaul were the best-maintained of any BAC One-Eleven operator. Faster climbs In the days when airports and air space were relatively uncongested, Laker Airways instructed departing One-Eleven crews to tune into other jet aircraft taking off ahead of them, and to begin a conversation with the other aircraft's crew while continuing their climb. The aim was to obtain information about the other aircraft's altitude to encourage that aircraft's crew to climb to their upper cruising altitude as quickly as possible so that Laker's One-Elevens could attain their optimum height in the shortest possible time. This helped Laker's One-Elevens climb faster without using too much power, thereby helping the company to reduce fuel consumption during one of the most fuel-intensive flight phases as well as reduce the engines' wear and tear. Increasing range by introducing weight-saving measures Among the weight-saving measures Laker Airways used to make its aircraft fly longer without refuelling was a baggage allowance limit of rather than the more usual as well as carrying fewer passengers than the aircraft could hold. This policy was first employed when the airline began operating its BAC One-Elevens. By limiting the free baggage allowance and restricting passengers, the company used the weight saved to carry additional fuel, increasing range. This was sufficient to permit non-stop flights from London Gatwick or Berlin Tegel to Tenerifeat the time the most popular resort in the Canary Islands for British and German tourists at least in one direction, depending on the direction and strength of the winds. This helped make Laker's One-Elevens more competitive with larger, longer-range aircraft operated by rivals, especially for tour operators struggling to fill a bigger aircraft profitably. If the passenger load was greater than 70, the charterer paid for any stops, encouraging operators to keep to 70 passengers.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 117/8Flying to the sun ‚Äì A history of Britain's holiday airlines: 6. Into the jet age ‚Äì Laker Airways, Woodley, C., The History Press, Stroud, 2016, p. 102 Alternatively, weight saved as a result of limiting free baggage could be traded for reduced fuel consumption on shorter routes well within the BAC One- Eleven's range by making the aircraft lighter, even with a full load of passengers.accommodating up to 89 at a seat pitch of Introduction of DC-10 aircraft McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 in 1976 Weight-saving measures adopted to boost the BAC One-Eleven's range stood Laker Airways in good stead when the airline introduced the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10. This model lacked the range of the DC-10-30. The DC-10-10 was optimised for medium-haul routes. The aircraft McDonnell Douglas was offering had been built against an order placed by Mitsui Group, for five aircraft, who intended to lease them to All Nippon Airways (ANA). But, instead, ANA decided to order the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar.Finance for British Trijets, Flight International, 10 August 1972, p. 179Armstrong, P., The Flight of the Accountant: a Romance of Air and Credit, Flight to insolvency, 2005, p. 14 Before offering, on behalf ot Mitsui, the aircraft to Laker, McDonnell Douglas had asked British Caledonian (BCal) whether it was interested. BCal was looking for a widebody replacement for its ageing Boeing 707s and Vickers VC10s. BCal rejected this offer because the aircraft had insufficient range to fly non-stop from Gatwick to the distant points on its network. Despite these drawbacks, Laker Airways took two of those five Mitsui (originally intended for ANA) ordered aircraft. The three remaining Mitsui aircraft went to Turkish Airlines (THY). The airline concluded it could fly non-stop from the UK to any point east of the Rockies by keeping the baggage limit at and reducing single-class seating from 380ten abreast to 345.nine abreast The saving could be used to carry more fuel. The calculations had shown that even with reduced seating, it had to fill only 52% of the seats to break even. Moreover, Laker Airways had figured that the aircraft's low break-even seat factor would enable it to operate its proposed London ‚Äì New York Skytrain with a lower break-even factor compared to the Boeing 707, an ageing narrow-bodied aircraft whose costs were higher per passenger. The DC-10s also had huge potential to boost the projected profitability of Skytrain. Revised estimates anticipated an average load factor of 70‚Äì75% and raised the traffic forecast for the first year of operation to 250,000 passengers each way. This was almost three times the original 707-based forecast.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 149, 158, 165 These factors swung the firm in favour of McDonnell-Douglas's offer. In addition, Laker Airways agreed with Japanese lessor Mitsui that was going to buy the aircraft from McDonnell-Douglas before leasing them to Laker to pay for the leases out of flying revenues only. This meant the airline was not going to pay for the aircraft if they were not revenue-earning. It proved to be effective to minimise the financial risk an investment on this scale posed.

Transatlantic Services ‚Äì Laker Airways, Woodley, C., The History Press, Stroud, 2016, p. 150 Since approval for Skytrain was not forthcoming for several years, Laker Airways needed alternative work to keep its long-haul planes busy. Initially, both Boeing 707s supplemented the BAC One-Elevens on Mediterranean and Canary Islands routes, such as Gatwick ‚Äì Palma de Mallorca and Gatwick‚ÄìTenerife. Both aircraft replaced Bristol Britanniasthe withdrawal of the Britannias made Laker Airways the first all-jet operator in Britain and Europe on the airline's long-haul flights, an increasing number of which were affinity group charters to North America, primarily the US.The Laker leader condemned, Letters, Flight International, Flight International, 6 March 1982, p. 571 During summer 1970, Laker sought the UK and Australian authorities' permission to operate a series of affinity group charter flights to Australia. Following his request's refusal, he flew to Australia in early 1971 to discuss his proposal for 15-day inclusive tours from Australia to the UK, including full board at first class hotels for A$935, with the director-general of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation who doubled as Qantas's chairman. Sir Freddie's visit did not succeed in convincing the Australian authorities of his proposal's merits as a result of lobbying from BOAC and Qantas, both of which were estimated to have lost ¬£11 million in revenue due to competition from charter airlines on the Kangaroo route.Charter manoeuvres in Australia, Flight International, 13 April 1972, p. 482Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 143/4 From December 1970, one of Laker's two 707s was used for a once-a-week low-fare service linking Luxembourg with Barbados on behalf of International Caribbean Airways, a joint venture between Barbados businessmen Norman Ricketts and Geoffrey Edwards, who enjoyed the support of the Barbados government, and Laker Airways. Laker Airways initially held a 33% stake in International Caribbean.in 1973, Sir Freddie bought out both of his Barbadian joint venture partners, while the Barbados Government took up an option to acquire a 51% stake in the airline; this increased Laker Airways's stake to 49% The aircraft Laker Airways allocated to International Caribbean Airways sported International Caribbean as well as the Barbadian flag on both sides of the forward fuselage in place of Laker and the Union Flag featured by the company's other aircraft.Laker Airways, Flight International, 10 February 1966, p. 208Contract Flag Carriers, Flight International, 28 February 1976, p. 474 In addition to the weekly Luxembourg‚ÄìBarbados schedule, which subsequently became twice weekly and was extended to London Gatwick, this aircraft operated regular charters from Canada and West Germany to Barbados. In January 1975, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) designated International Caribbean Airways the flag carrier for Barbados.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 144 =Widebody era= In November 1972, Laker became the first airline outside North America to operate the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebody when it took delivery of a pair of new series 10 aircraftthese aircraft incorporated Skytrain titles in a hybrid \\"Union Jack / Stars and Stripes\\" scheme on the starboard side of the white upper forward part of the fuselage, in anticipation of approval to commence Skytrain from MDC's factory in Long Beach, California, via Japanese lessor Mitsui.Europe's first wide-body trijet service, Flight International, 30 November 1972, p. 773 =Simplified charter rules across the Atlantic= On 1 April 1973, new charter regulations in the UK, the US and Canada replaced the complicated \\"affinity group\\" rules with simplified rules termed \\"Advance Booking Charters\\", popularly known as ABC. The following day, a Laker Airways McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 flew the world's inaugural ABC flight from Manchester to Toronto. Laker's first ABC passengers had paid ¬£45 return. The inaugural flight was operated under contract to Laker's Liverpool-based in-house package tour operator Arrowsmith Holidays, a group company since 1967. It was followed by similar ABC services from Prestwick and a three-times-a-week Gatwick‚ÄìToronto ABC operation. The latter was operated under contract to Lord Brothers, the airline's London-based in-house tour operator that had been part of the group since 1968 and changed its name to Laker Air Travel in 1974.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 184, 186/7 A third DC-10 series 10 widebody joined the fleet in April 1974 to maintain the airline's commitments in the ABC flights market. (Laker intended to allocate two DC-10s exclusively to Skytrain in anticipation of the start of daily services between Stansted and Newark later that year.Laker's 1,000 days, Flight International, 31 January 1974, p. 131 This aircraft was eventually used to meet growing ABC commitments.) The new ABC rules enabled Sir Freddie to build a successful ABC flights business across the North Atlantic over the next couple of years, making Laker Airways the market leader in transatlantic ABC flights. During the early to mid-1970s, the airline ran low-key advertising on hoardings and public transport in London, Manchester and other large British cities under the motto \\"Take a Laker\\". Laker's transatlantic charters provided meals, movies ‚Äì new in those days that helped distinguish it from the competition ‚Äì and a free bar. The success of Laker Airways's transatlantic ABC flights resulted in an application to launch an Australian low-fare operation from Gatwick and/or Luxembourg to Sydney and Melbourne.Laker asks for Australian charters, Flight International, 4 June 1977, p. 1632Skytrain to Australia?, Flight International, 30 July 1977, p. 309Flight International, 5 July 1980, p. 6 Laker's application was dismissed by Peter Nixon, the Australian Transport Minister. Nixon stated that the UK‚ÄìAustralia scheduled air services market was to remain the preserve of British Airways and Qantas. This decision was the result of successful lobbying by Qantas, which had exerted pressure on its government to protect the long-established duopoly it shared with British Airways on the Kangaroo route under a joint revenue-sharing agreement. Nixon also maintained that the proposed service to only two Australian points would be discriminatory on people living in other parts of the country by denying them the benefits of low fares. These comments prompted Sir Freddie to retort that the Australian transport minister still thought the earth was flat, and that it had not come to his attention that Australia already had a number of regional airlines covering the whole of the country.Qantas at the barricades, Flight International, 1 July 1978, p. 6Australia blocks Laker Airways charter plan, Flight International, 21 October 1978, p. 1457 An advertising campaign featuring the slogan \\"I've got my name on every plane!\\" was developed in conjunction with a New York-based company. It was successfully launched during the Super Bowl VIII interval in January 1974. \\"Laker to London ‚Äì the end of Skyway robbery\\" was the follow-on campaign. The success of these campaigns resulted in Laker carrying more non-scheduled UK‚ÄìUS passengers than all US carriers combined. Despite attaining market leadership in the transatlantic ABC market, Sir Freddie considered this second best in the absence of his Skytrain service. =Redrawing traditional battle lines= A feature characterising the long battle over Skytrain was that the main protagonists were two private airlines, rather than the private ones on one side and state owned carriers such as BEA and BOAC on the other. British Caledonian (BCal), Britain's foremost private airline and the country's \\"second force\\" carrier as well as Laker Airways's neighbour at Gatwick, became the fiercest opponent.Skytrain \\"no industry solution\\", Flight International, 10 August 1972, p. 174Laker's Skytrain approved by Britain, Flight International, 5 October 1972, p. 447Skytrain nearer, Flight International, 11 January 1973, p. 47 The fact that scheduled operations were regulated and limited opportunities existed for independent airlines on major domestic and international routes explained BCal's opposition. This also meant that most bilateral agreements the UK government had negotiated with overseas counterparts contained no provisions for a second British scheduled airline in addition to the incumbent UK flag carrier. The few bilateral agreements that did contain such a provision ‚Äì for instance, the Bermuda II accord governing commercial air services between Britain and the US ‚Äì contained no provision for UK authorities to designate a third carrier.Bermuda 2 initialled, Flight International, 2 July 1977, p. 5Bermuda 2: signed and sealed ..., Flight International, 23 July 1977, p. 254 For this reason any licence to Laker to operate a scheduled service on a route of its choosing and nominating it as the UK's second designated flag carrier on that route prevented BCal from operating a competing service. Another reason BCal opposed Laker's plans was that under the \\"second force\\" concept, the cornerstone of British aviation policy throughout the 1970s and first half of the 1980s, BCal was the Government's \\"chosen instrument of the private sector\\". This meant the Government supported BCal's worldwide ambitions before considering rival independent airlines. In addition, BCal, Laker and most other independents in the UK were denied access to Heathrow, the main market for scheduled airlines in the UK, particularly business class passengers from and to London and accessible to more of the population in Southeast England. Confining these airlines to Gatwick forced them to compete for fewer business class passengers and with a smaller catchment area of population. BCal felt Laker would undermine its status as the official \\"Second Force\\" and weaken it by making it difficult to become a serious competitor to the established airlines. =Skytrain takes to the air= Laker Airways had taken delivery of a fourth McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 series 10 widebodied jet in 1976 in preparation for the launch of its daily London ‚Äì New York Skytrain. This aircraft was the DC-10's second prototype, which the airline had acquired direct from MDC at a knock-down price. By that time, the work force had expanded to 1,000.up from only 500 the year before Skytrain was inaugurated between London Gatwick and New York JFK on 26 September 1977.Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 225First Skytrain leaves on Monday, Flight International, 24 September 1977, p. 875 It recorded a profit in excess of ¬£2 million in its first year of operation.Flying to the sun ‚Äì A history of Britain's holiday airlines: 10.

This enabled the airline to offer bookable seats, excursion fares and the carriage of cargo in addition to the original, non-bookable Skytrain fare from Gatwick to New York JFK and Los Angeles.Laker wins unrestricted Skytrain, Flight International, 14 July 1979, p. 73 With the arrival of the series 30 DC-10s, Intasun owner Harry Goodman recognised that long-haul charters to new destinations were now available and approached Laker with a number of possibilities from the Caribbean to Florida. Eventually, Goodman chose Florida and Disney World charters were introduced to the UK market. The programme rapidly expanded to seven times weekly and was eventually converted into a Skytrain operation to Miami.Short hauls ..., Flight International, 6 October 1979, p. 1098 By October 1980, Laker introduced fully bookable Super Economy fares on all Skytrain services. These were approximately half its competitors' standard economy fares and significantly lower than those airlines' Super APEXAdvanced Purchase Excursion fares. The airline reserved about 60% of its scheduled seats for the new bookable fares. This move marked a major strategic shift in the company's fare structure.Laker bares North Atlantic teeth, Flight International, 23 August 1980, p. 652 Tampa, Florida, was added in 1981 from Gatwick, Manchester and Prestwick, following lobbying from Bob Beckman's client.Bob Beckman was Laker's American lawyer By that time, the firm had sold both the older, shorter fuselage Boeing 707-138Bsone to Indonesia and one to Africa and disposed of one BAC One-Eleven.acquired by Dan-Air This left it with 20 aircraft comprising 14 widebodiesArmstrong, P., The Flight of the Accountant: a Romance of Air and Credit, Flight to insolvency, 2005, p. 15 and six narrowbodies ‚Äì 11 DC-10s,five series 30 and six series 10 aircraft three A300s, two 707s and four One-Elevens, doubling the size within only five years.

During the 1981 summer period, Laker operated up to three daily frequencies each way between Gatwick and JFK and Gatwick and Miami as well as twice daily round-trips between Gatwick and Los Angeles. This made Laker the fourth biggest transatlantic scheduled airline between the UK and USbehind British Airways, Pan Am and Trans World Airlines (TWA) as well as fifth biggest overall.Annoh, L., My Tribute to Sir Freddie Laker, Executive Traveller, International Edition ‚Äì Vol. 13/Spring 2006, p. 8 By that time, the airline had carried over two million Skytrain passengers.Annoh, L., My Tribute to Sir Freddie Laker, Executive Traveller, International Edition ‚Äì Vol. 13/Spring 2006, p. 7 =Abortive attempts to expand Skytrain= Plans for a new low-fare Australian service In 1980, Laker Airways withdrew its application to run ABC flights to Australia. Instead, the airline proposed a scheduled low-fare service from London Gatwick with one stop. It was to be one flight a day in each direction using the airline's five McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30 widebodies. In contrast to Skytrain, this was to feature a first class section called Pullman. It was to operate three flights per week each to Sydney and Melbourne respectively, and one to Perth.Laker applies for round-the-world and European Skytrain, 30 June 1979, p. 2330British Caledonian seeks Australian rights, Flight International, 18 October 1980, p. 1490Laker and BCal bid for kangaroo route, Flight International, 7 February 1981, p. 330 The CAA took a negative view of Laker's application for a UK‚ÄìAustralia scheduled low-fare service and a rival application by BCal to launch a conventional, scheduled service between Gatwick and four Australian destinations via Colombo at four flights a week each way. It considered Laker's market growth forecast overoptimistic, its stimulation factors unreal, and its fares intentions vague. In the CAA's opinion, the Australians were unlikely to accept another UK airline without a reciprocal service from a second Australian carrier, and the traffic on the UK‚ÄìAustralia route would not support two additional carriers without a substantial reduction in service frequencies of the incumbent operators. (The CAA told BCal that it considered its proposal for a new, faster service to Australia superior to Laker's, and that it would therefore look favourably on its application if it wished to re-apply with specific proposals for a joint Anglo-Australian operation.)CAA refuses to license new UK‚ÄìAustralia operators, Flight International, 16 May 1981, p. 1366 Second designated UK carrier to Hong Kong The UK government decided in 1979 to open the route between London and Hong Kong to competition. This was to be by a second British scheduled carrier to ease the shortage of seats passengers were experiencing at peak times on the ten-times-a-week monopoly service by British Airways from Heathrow. A race ensued when BCal, Laker and Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's de facto \\"flag carrier\\", filed their applications with the CAA in London.Three carriers seek licences for Hong Kong route, Flight International, 4 August 1979, p. 311Short hauls ..., Flight International, 8 December 1979, p. 1895 Laker proposed a daily Skytrain linking Gatwick and Hong Kong via SharjahGulf rights for Hong Kong, Flight International, 25 October 1980, p. 1551 to be operated with single-class, 380-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s. At the CAA hearing the airline proposed larger, higher capacity Boeing 747s as soon as this was justified by increased demand. The company tried to convince the CAA that its additional all-economy class discount service was the best option to alleviate the shortage of seats on this route. Its analysis showed the bottom end of the economy market was the most under-served segment because of the scarcity of low fares. The other airlines used Laker's analysis in support of their claims that Skytrain would flood the market with cheap seats that risked undermining profitability without doing anything to alleviate the shortage of premium seats. Laker retorted that low fares would stimulate the market by meeting untapped demand from people who could not afford to fly this route because of British Airways's high fares, rather than taking market share from competitors. It pointed to the success of its transatlantic Skytrain in helping create demand while maintaining that its rivals' proposals would do little to meet the unsatisfied demand for low-fare seats. The CAA awarded a licence to operate unlimited scheduled services between London and Hong Kong to BCal, which had proposed running a conventional service from Gatwick via Dubai, using its growing fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodies in a three-class configuration featuring a first and an executive class in addition to economy. BCal had also agreed to offer a number of low fares that would match the lowest fares Laker had proposed. The CAA rejected Cathay Pacific's and Laker's applications, clearing the way for BCal to become the second British scheduled carrier on that route.B.CAL receives London-Hong Kong licence, Flight International, 22 March 1980, p. 886 However, Hong Kong's Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) refused to endorse BCal because many felt upset that Cathay Pacific was excluded from one of the world's most lucrative routes. This caused a row between the UK and Hong Kong governments. Cathay Pacific began lobbying in the Crown colony as well as in the UK, stressing it had invested millions in the British economy at a time of high unemployment in the UK by placing large orders for Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747s. The UK government allowed Cathay Pacific to join Laker in appealing to John Nott, the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, against the CAA's award of a licence exclusively to BCal. The Secretary of State overturned the CAA's decision and opened the route to all three airlines without placing restrictions on frequencies of service. For Laker Airways this turned out to be a partial victory because the ATLA continued to refuse a reciprocal permit, without which Laker's service remained grounded.Nott overturns CAA ruling and sanctions Hong Kong free-for-all, Flight International, 28 June 1980, p. 1441Hong Kong ATLA rejects Laker, Flight International, 15 November 1980, p. 1845 Cathay Pacific commenced a thrice-weekly service between Hong Kong and London Gatwick via Bahrain on 17 July 1980 using a Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747-200B ahead of BCal, which began a four-times-a-week London Gatwick ‚Äì Hong Kong service via Dubai on 1 August 1980 using a McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30. Globetrain Laker Airways planned to link its Gatwick ‚Äì Los Angeles Skytrain with the proposed Gatwick ‚Äì Hong Kong Skytrain across the Pacific via Honolulu and Tokyo to create the first daily round-the-world through service by a British airline in both directions.at the time Pan Am was the only airline to operate such a serviceCAA boosts Laker global Skytrain plan, Flight International, 13 June 1981, p. 1837Pan Am global 747, Flight International, 28 October 1971, p. 677More cutbacks at Pan Am, Flight International, 2 October 1982, p. 970 This was to be marketed under the trademark Globetrain. Cathay Pacific was among airlines attacking Laker's plans. The established transpacific airlines were concerned that Laker was likely to create excess capacity, threatening the profitability as well as long-term viability of these routes. Sir Freddie said Cathay seemed concerned about sharing the Hong Kong ‚Äì Tokyo route with a competitor because this route was the main source of profits for Cathay Pacific's Asian and transpacific operation. Laker abandoned Globetrain due to its inability to obtain regulatory approvals. 666 new Skytrain routes to Europe proposed Laker Skytrain Airbus A300 in 1982 In September 1978, Laker Airways became the UK launch customer for the twin-engined Airbus A300, short and medium-haul widebodied jet. The airline ordered 10 series B4 aircraft in a 314-seat single-class configuration to serve a network of up to 666 European Skytrain routes.Laker proposes 666 European routes, Flight International, 27 October 1979, p. 1341CAA hearings: set for a long fight, Flight International, 3 November 1979, p. 1465 The majority of the low-fare network was not going to touch the UK, making it the first pan-European commercial airline. Laker's European Skytrain plans were opposed by BCal, which was keen to expand its European network beyond routes linking Gatwick with Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam, Brussels and Genoa. BCal needed to develop its connecting traffic at Gatwick by growing the European network to include Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Southern Europe to help it increase loads on flights to Africa, South America and the US as well as improve profitability. BCal came up with its own proposal, Miniprix, to counter Laker. This alternative was less ambitious than Laker's. Excluding BCal's existing four European routes, it envisaged linking Gatwick with 20 additional points on the Continent. Services were to be operated during off-peak times with BAC One-Eleven 500s and Boeing 707-320Cs.Trade Secretary rejects UK-European low-fare routes appeal ..., Flight International, 1 November 1980, p. 1673 BCal was considering both the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 narrowbody as well as the Airbus A310 widebody as long-term replacements for its existing narrow-bodied aircraft on these proposed routes.Two Concordes, A310s and 20 new routes in B.CAL package, Flight International, 19 May 1979, p. 1637 Dan-Air and Britannia Airways, the UK's leading charter airlines, feared that without reciprocal foreign regulatory approvals Laker would be forced to dump this additional widebody capacity on the European charter market, creating excess capacity that would collapse charter rates. The CAA heard Laker's as well as BCal's and other UK independent airlines' proposals. It rejected Laker.CAA applies brake to UK airlines' European low-fare plans, Flight International, 22 March 1980, p. 888 It subsequently awarded two scheduled licences to Laker Airways, one for Gatwick ‚Äì Berlin Tegel and the other for Gatwick‚ÄìZ√ºrich, following British Airways's decision to abandon short-haul routes it had been operating from Gatwick at low frequencies since the late 1970s and to surrender unused licences to the CAA.BA loses Gatwick‚ÄìZurich to Laker, Flight International, 21 March 1981, p. 796Laker breaks cloud and flies into Zurich, Flight International, 9 January 1982, p. 47 By the time the CAA awarded Laker these licences, the airline was experiencing financial difficulties and had to dispose of three A300 widebodies to cut costs by reducing the number of aircraft types as well as its overall size.Banks press Laker to sell Airbus A300s, Flight International, 7 November 1981, p. 1356US money for Laker as he sells A300s, Flight International, 30 January 1982, p. 209 Laker Airways intended to commence operations on both routes during the spring of 1982, operating two flights a day each way using spare capacity on its remaining BAC One-Elevens.

This route, the airline's only short-haul scheduled operation, had come about after British Airways's decision to abandon its loss-making Manchester‚ÄìZ√ºrich services. Laker's application to have BA's licence transferred to itself resulted in its becoming the UK flag carrier between Manchester and Z√ºrich. The airline's subsequent withdrawal and its demise in turn resulted in Dan-Air becoming the UK flag carrier between Manchester and Z√ºrich.

The company did not have aircraft to use these licences immediately. Its deteriorating financial position did not let it add more aircraft. By the time Laker Airways went out of business, those licences remained unused. They were eventually allocated to other airlines. Bankruptcy Laker Airways aircraft stored the day after bankruptcy Laker Airways did not have the financial strength to survive the early 1980s recession and competition by the established scheduled airlines.Laker cash flow fails to impress creditors, Flight International, 13 February 1982, p. 330 Swiss aviation enthusiasts' magazine Interavia had reported in a 1978 issue that Laker's issued share capital was ¬£10,000. As per the airline's 1980 balance sheet, the paid-up share capital was ¬£504,000. These figures compared unfavourably with BCal and British Airways, whose issued share capital stood at ¬£12 million and ¬£100 million respectively.as per the relevant 1978 Interavia edition As long ago as June 1971, when Skytrain was first announced, it was revealed that Laker Airways had net assets of ¬£1.68 million and tax equalisation reserves of ¬£450,000. Although this amounted to over ¬£2 million, it could not disguise the fact that Laker Airways was a financial minnow compared with most of the established flag carriers and BCal. The weak financial position was underlined by the fact that 90 percent of the share capital was held by Sir Freddie and the remainder by Joan Laker, a former spouse, while Laker Airways was a subsidiary of Laker Airways (Leasing), which in turn was a subsidiary of Jersey-incorporated Laker Airways (International). This had served the firm well since it allowed it to take advantage of lower taxes and more employer-friendly labour legislation in the Channel Islands.compared with the UKArmstrong, P., The Flight of the Accountant: a Romance of Air and Credit, Flight to insolvency, 2005, p. 12 However, the fact that the airline's ultimate holding company was in an off-shore tax haven outside the jurisdiction of UK law increased lenders' risk to get their money back. In addition to undercapitalisation, unsustainably high debts and weak finances, Laker Airways was not backed by any significant assets. The bulk of its fleetincluding all widebodies was leased, as was the maintenance hangar at Gatwick that also housed the airline's offices. The only financial backup that Laker Airways had was Sir Freddie's stud farm and his personal wealth.Cosmopolitan ‚Äì I'm Freddie. Fly me!, pp. 94 ..., Hearst Publishing UK, London, August 1978 =Economic climate= Both the UK and US were in recession in the early 1980s, characterised by negative/low growth, high unemployment, high inflation and high interest rates. During that period the company was expanding to sustain commercial success generally and that of Skytrain in particular. Laker Airways needed to position itself to take advantage of additional opportunities to expand its business to maintain its status as Britain's second largest independent airline and third principal long-haul operator.behind British Airways and BCal Eventually, the company borrowed at high interest rates. The high interest rates were a major cause for the increase in the firm's borrowing costs as well as its debts.Laker's Mayday Time, 15 February 1982Armstrong, P., The Flight of the Accountant: a Romance of Air and Credit, Flight to insolvency, 2005, pp. 17/8 Although the Laker Airways fleet contained a greater proportion of modern widebodied aircraft than most of its competitors, which made it cheaper to operate and maintain, the airline felt the sudden tripling of the price of crude oil in the aftermath of the Shah of Iran's fall from power. Laker Airways needed to pay the high spot market oil prices because it could not hedge its future supplies by negotiating fixed-rate, forward purchases. Such financial derivatives were non-existent. The airline attempted to protect itself against sterling-dollar exchange rate fluctuations by buying US dollars at a fixed rate. This was a necessity as most of its costs were in dollars whereas most of its income was in pounds sterling. The company's growing problems were exacerbated by wrongly anticipating the sterling-dollar exchange rate for the 1981/2 winter season.Laker Airways (Hansard, 5 February 1982) During all 1980 and the better part of 1981 the rate was 1:2. The pound could buy two dollars because sterling was kept high by Britain's North Sea oil exports and the importance these exports assumed against high crude oil prices. Laker Airways did not anticipate the speed of sterling's subsequent decline. This meant that it needed to pay more for dollars than it had originally budgeted, leading to an outflow of funds at a time of financial crisis.Laker's Lament Time, 2 November 1981Laker liquidator's anti-trust charges revealed, Flight International, 11 December 1982, p. 1660 =Mistakes= The Skytrain concept was targeting people clamouring for discounted air fares across the Atlantic. This was a market the established transatlantic scheduled carriers had ignored, mainly because it was not profitable given their high cost structures and complex organisations.Armstrong, P., The Flight of the Accountant: a Romance of Air and Credit, Flight to insolvency, 2005, p. 16 Although Laker Airways had lower costs and a simpler organisation,Fly me, I'm Freddie!, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 149 it needed high year-round loads to make money at discount prices. Most of the passengers were likely to travel during the summer peak period. This made it challenging to achieve high loads during the winter. =Beginning of the end= The beginning of the end came when Pan Am, a transatlantic competitor, decided in October 1981 to drop its lowest economy fares where it was in competition with Skytrain by up to 66%.Pan Am declares North Atlantic fares war ..., Flight International, 17 October 1981, p. 1126 Laker retaliated by introducing a cut-price premium cabin branded Regency Class.... as Laker aims low fares at the high-yield market ..., Flight International, 17 October 1981, p. 1126Laker has no loan-repayment problem, Flight International, 24 October 1981, p. 1232 Following the end of the 1981/2 winter peak, there was insufficient traffic to support four airlines competing across the North Atlantic between January and March. At this point, state-owned British Airways and TWA, Laker's other transatlantic competitors, dropped their fares by a similar amount. As a result, Laker's loads and cash inflow halved between October 1981 and February 1982.Laker ‚Äì a victim of predatory pricing?, Letters, Flight International, 27 February 1982, p. 500The rape of Laker, Letters, Flight International, 9 March 1985, p. 36 It has also been suggested that Laker experienced a downturn after passengers began avoiding the Douglas DC-10 due to the series of high-profile fatal accidents that befell the type at the end of the 1970s. =Final blow= The final blow came when British Caledonian (BCal) found out about a ¬£5 million rescue package that McDonnell DouglasLaker's stake in Laker will reduce, Flight International, 2 January 1982, p. 3 and General Electric (GE), the suppliers of DC-10 widebodied aircraft and its CF6 engines to Laker as well as BCal, had put together.GECAS, a unit of GE, were lessors of some of the widebodied aircraft in Laker's fleet BCal wrote to other operators of the DC-10/CF6 in Europe saying that BCal on behalf of all European operators warned McDonnell Douglas and GE that in the event of the rescue for Laker being approved, none of these airlines would do business with those companies. McDonnell Douglas and GE did not go ahead.

Similarly, buying tickets on the day of travel has been adopted by airline shuttles plying the United States' Northeast corridor (where competition with the Acela is fierce) and on the Eastern shores of Australia. Laker's most important legacy was that pioneering low-fare services across the Atlantic helped pave the way for low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair, liberating the industry from the regulatory straitjacket IATA had imposed for decades in collusion with governments. These governments invariably were sole or majority owners of most IATA airlines. This was Laker's greatest contribution to its industry's future development. However, unlike Laker, the vast majority of low-cost airlines have limited themselves to short and midrange flights and shunned the long range market. Almost all attempts to enter the long range market with a low cost model have ended within a couple of years in either withdrawal or bankruptcy.

The aircraft made an emergency landing at Hanover Airport because of an electrical fire in an aerial tuning unit in the forward cabin area behind the flight deck. The fire started when the aircraft was from Hanover, filling the cabin with fumes. This reduced visibility on the flight deck to . Forward vision was nil. Using the emergency oxygen system, the captain began his emergency descent from FL250 under radar guidance from Hanover air traffic control (ATC), while the co-pilot depressurised the aircraft and attempted to open a side window to clear the smoke. The cabin crew were deprived of both their public address system and intercom with the flight deck during the descent. Due to lack of time before landing, emergency procedures were abandoned. Following the successful emergency landing, the aircraft came to a rapid halt clear of the runway. By the time the last of the 89 occupants (five crew and 84 passengers) had evacuated the aircraft, the fire had burned through the pressure hull and was being fed by oxygen. There were no injuries. The fire was extinguished on the ground. Following the incident, the aircraft manufacturer issued several service bulletins (SBs) listing action to be taken as mandated by the UK's Airworthiness Requirements Board (ARB). These SBs were circulated to all One-Eleven operators. The ARB also issued a more general warning to all One-Eleven operators regarding the need to ensure that oxygen leaks do not create fire hazards, and that oxygen lines are routed away from potential fire sources. As a result of this incident, the ARB also began to pay close attention to the fire resistance of aircraft fittings and furnishings due to their potential to form major hazards in oxygen-fed inflight fires. The flight deck crew, Captain Basil Bradshaw and First Officer Bernard Sedgwick, subsequently received the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air,. while the cabin crew were commended for their action during the emergency.

Officially it constituted the Extraordinary Meeting of the Andean Presidential Council (Reuni√≥n Extraordinaria del Consejo Presidencial Andino ) and was also billed as the Third Meeting of Presidents of South America (III Reuni√≥n de Presidentes de Am√©rica del Sur). The main item on the agenda was the signature, by heads of state and plenipotentiary representatives of 12 South American nations, of the Cuzco Declaration, a two-page document containing a preamble to the deed of foundation of the South American Community of Nations (or \\"South American Union\\"), uniting the region's two existing free-trade organisations - Mercosur and the Andean Community. Ayacucho was chosen for symbolic reasons: it was there that Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, fighting under the banner of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var \\"the Liberator\\", defeated the last Imperial Spanish troops in South America on 9 December 1824. While the organisation's exact nature and functions - and even its name - remain unclear, it aspires to evolve along the lines followed by the continental integration efforts of the European Union, rather than becoming a mere free-trade area. The initiative emerged - largely at the instigation of Brazil - in response to the failed negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas.

He served as the governor of Western Region, Nigeria between 1960 and 1962. Adesoji Aderemi was known as a wealthy man and had a large family of many wives and children. One of his children was the civil servant Tejumade Alakija. During the colonial era, the Oba Ooni gained a considerable amount of power due to the colonial policy of indirect rule and being labelled a first class Oba among traditional rulers in Yorubaland. The policy of indirect rule was used to ensure native awareness and consultations about colonial policies affecting the regions. The British leaned on existing native political structures and hierarchy, particularly the Nigerian traditional rulers, for political consultation and tax collection. Later on, the Ooni with the consent of the leading Yoruba political leaders used his position to close the gaps of exploitation of divisional differences among Yorubas and tried fervently to rally the Yoruba towards a common goal. In 1962, the king acting as governor, used his power to remove the premier of the region, sensing the premier did not have the support of the majority members of the House of Assembly. The event escalated the political rivalries in the region.*Onigegewura Early life He was born on the 15th of November 1889, during the turbulence of the Yoruba civil war to Prince Gbadebo of the Osinkola ruling house of Ile Ife and madam Adekunbi of Ipetumodu, Ife north local govt, in the absence of his warrior father, who was on a war expedition; he was named Adesoji Aderemi. Oba Aderemi as a young King, 1930 On Prince Gbadebo's return, Adesoji's older sister Ibiyemi, unable to contain her excitement of the news had to be held back from initial physical contact with her war-weary and juju laden father. Until he had rid himself of his protective war attire by appeasing his gods, then was it safe to embrace his family. Prince Gbadebo being an Ifa priest, presented his newborn to his Ifa Oracle demanding to know what the future holds for the new baby Aderemi. The father was told to bow to his son. The Ifa predicted that baby Aderemi, was going to wear the crown of his ancestors, that his reign will be known far and wide, and he will come in contact with strangers in far away places. Prince Gbadebo told his wife to get coral beads to dress his son as was customary for royalty. In the belief of the oracle, mother-Adekunbi went into protective mode, always washing Aderemi in herbs, until he outgrew her methods. Having lost his father at eight years of age, he was subsequently raised by his mother. The emergence of Christianity dissuaded his mother from the traditional family worship of Ifa, hence his enrollment at the new local Christian primary school of St Phillips, Ife, as one of the first students in Ife to attend a local school in 1901. The young Prince Aderemi had a vision. His objection to farming with his much older and beloved brother, Papa Prince Adeyemo, led to his enrollment at the Anglican primary school at Aiyetoro, Ile-Ife. Under the tutelage and mentorship of Revd Canon J Adejumo, a.k.a. Baba Aiyetoro, who later became his father in law. He had an affinity for the law profession and could have travelled to the United Kingdom for the law programme, with his contemporaries of the day - Bashiru August. Not Aderemi, he had a date with destiny - the Ife Crown. Despite losing his father Prince Gbadebo so early, he kept his ambition on track, thanks to the beady eye of his mother. Ooni of Ife: 1930-1980  Prince Aderemi‚Äôs wealth and exposure made him the clear candidate to rise to the throne of Ile-Ife. Upon the death of Oba Ademiluyi, his predecessor, he became the outstanding contestant for the throne. Oba Aderemi at an Olojo festival outing On the 2nd of September, he became the 49th Ooni of Ife. He was widely dubbed the first literate Ooni. Oba Aderemi quickly acclimatised himself to his new environment, at 40, he was the youngest of the Yoruba Obas at the time. Oba Aderemi with the aid of the traditional Ife elders, (Obalufe, Obajio, Obaloran, Wasin, Obalaye, Akogun, Jagunosin, Ejesi), formed the administrative set up that transformed the ancient town in the next decade. Oba Aderemi championed Education during his reign as Ooni, which was the sentiment behind the foundation of Oduduwa College in January 1932. Oba Aderemi personally funded the construction of the Secondary School, a model institution at the time; Oba Aderemi believed that the surest way to facilitate and sustain modernisation is through education. A great landmark of his reign pertaining education was the foundation of the University of Ife, which many attributed to Oba Aderemi‚Äôs influence in the ruling Government, with the Ooni tenaciously proposing Ife as the ideal location for the foremost institution to be situated. Oba Aderemi constructed the main building of his palace, which remains a mainstay of the Ife palace to date - with its unique colonial-style. Ooni Aderemi served as the permanent chairman of the council of Obas from 1966-1980. His reign as Ooni was remarkably peaceful, with his innovative ideas in business creating a pathway to wealth for a lot of indigenes, especially in the agriculture industry, where he was a business leader himself.

It is named after the prehistoric bas-relief (stone carving) of La vache qui pleure near Djanet in the south of Algeria which is pictured on the album cover. Its title La vache qui pleure (French for The crying cow) may also be a joke with the famous French cheese label La vache qui rit (The laughing cow). It is the sisters' second full album of French songs, following on from their 1980 album Entre Lajeunesse et la sagesse, while several of their other albums also included a few French songs.Kate & Anna McGarrigle, La Vache Qui Pleure The album does include one English song, \\"Sunflower\\", which is a setting of William Blake's poem \\"Ah! Sunflower\\". The same song is performed in French (\\"Ah tournesol\\"), as a straight translation of the original. Blake's poem is not acknowledged in the credits for either song. Guest musicians on the album include Joel Zifkin, Lily Lanken (Anna's daughter), and Martha Wainwright (Kate's daughter). In 2005, the album was given a European release on the Munich label, and a twelfth track, \\"La complainte du phoque en Alaska\\" which was written originally by Michel Rivard for Beau Dommage a Montreal based band, was added. That version is currently out of print. Critical reception Brendan Kelly, reviewer for Montreal Gazette, wrote on November 22, 2003: \\"La Vache qui pleure, like most McGarrigles albums, feels like it exists out of time. Some songs sound like they could have been recorded in the 1940s or yesterday.\\" In his review in The Guardian on April 15, 2005, Robin Denselow wrote: \\"This new set, with all but one song in French, is a nod to their French-Canadian roots. Kate plays guitars, banjo, piano and violin, Anna adds accordion and the occasional dash of synthesizer, and Martha helps out on harmonies. The production is more gutsy than in the past, the singing and playing are fine as ever, and the songs range from the thoughtful Ce Matin to Petites Bo√Ætes, an unexpectedly refreshing reworking of the well-worn Little Boxes, the Malvina Reynolds song made famous by Pete Seeger.\\" Also on April 15, 2005, Andy Gill of The Independent wrote: \\"Presumably named in opposition to the synthetic connotations of the French processed cheese, La Vache Qui Pleure (Crying Cow) features folksy arrangements of Acadian fiddles, accordions and banjos, with the sisters' harmonies adding an Enya-esque gossamer quality to tracks such as \\"Petite Annonce Amoureuse\\" and \\"Sunflower (Ah Tournesol)\\", where the swelling and subsiding of the backing instruments is like the lapping of an ocean on a distant beach. There's a keen awareness of the plight of powerless outsiders, be they the homesick refugee of \\"Ce Matin\\", the natives of Michel Rivard's \\"La Complainte du Phoque en Alaska\\", lamenting the way their youngsters leave for the US, or the cow of the title- track, weeping for her lost calf. Most quirkily enjoyable is the reading of Malvina Reynolds' folk standard \\"Little Boxes (Petites Boites)\\", rendered as a lolloping cajun waltz of fiddle, accordion and guitars.\\" Track listing All songs by Kate & Anna McGarrigle and Philippe Tatartcheff, except where noted. #\\"Petite annonce amoureuse\\" ‚Äì 3:58 #\\"Ah tournesol\\" ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"Le bambocheur\\" (Kate McGarrigle) ‚Äì 2:22 #\\"Hurle le vent\\" ‚Äì 3:22 #\\"La Vache qui pleure\\" ‚Äì 4:08 #\\"Rose blanche\\" (Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Ph.

Adler, Zigmund Feinman, Zigmund Mogulesko, Rudolf Marx, Mr. Krastoshinsky and David Kessler, 1888 Jacob Pavlovich Adler (born Yankev P. Adler;[Adler 1999] p.xxiii, [Prager 1997] February 12, 1855 ‚Äì April 1, 1926)IMDB biography was a Jewish actor and star of Yiddish theater, first in Odessa, and later in London and in New York City's Yiddish Theater District. Nicknamed \\"nesher hagodol\\",Nahshon 2001[Rosenfeld 1977] (\\"the Great Eagle\\", Adler being the German for \\"eagle\\"), he achieved his first theatrical success in Odessa, but his career there was rapidly cut short when Yiddish theater was banned in Russia in 1883.[Adler 1999] pp.98‚Äì102, 108, 114 et. seq. 222‚Äì225. He became a star in Yiddish theater in London, and in 1889, on his second voyage to the United States, he settled in New York City.[Adler 1999] pp.232‚Äì321. Adler soon started a company of his own, ushering in a new, more serious Yiddish theater, most notably by recruiting the Yiddish theater's first realistic playwright, Jacob Gordin. Adler scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin's Der Yiddisher King Lear (The Jewish King Lear), set in 19th- century Russia, which along with his portrayal of Shakespeare's Shylock would form the core of the persona he defined as the \\"Grand Jew\\".[Adler 1999] pp. 200‚Äì209, 321‚Äì325 Nearly all his family went into theater; probably the most famous was his daughter Stella, who taught method acting to, among others, Marlon Brando. Childhood and youth Adler was born in Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Adler's father Feivel (Pavel) Abramovitch Adler was a (rather unsuccessful) grain merchant. His mother, n√©e Hessye Halperin, was a tall, beautiful woman, originally from a wealthy family in Berdichev. She became estranged from her family after divorcing her first husband (and leaving behind a son) to marry Adler's father. The marriage to a divorc√©e cost Feivel Adler (and therefore Jacob Adler) his status as a Kohen (priest). His paternal grandfather lived with them for some eight years; he was a pious man, and the family was much more observant of Jewish religious practices during the time he lived with them. However, according to Adler, the real patriarch of the family was his wealthy uncle Aaron \\"Arke\\" Trachtenberg, who would later be the model for his portrayal of roles such as Gordin's Jewish King Lear.[Adler 1999] pp.5, 7, 9‚Äì10; ibid. p. 33 for status as Kohen. Adler grew up with one foot in a traditional Jewish world and one in a more modern, European one. His granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld writes, \\"Of the haskala [Jewish Enlightenment] as an organized system of ideas, he probably knew little or nothing.\\"[Adler 1999] p.xxiv His education was irregular: as the family fortunes rose and fell, he would be sent to cheder (Jewish religious school) or to a Russian language county school, pulled out of school entirely, or have a private tutor for a few months. He wrote that \\"the sum of my learning was a little arithmetic, some Russian grammar, and a few French phrases.\\"[Adler 1999] pp.11‚Äì13, 18 He grew up with both Jewish and Christian playmates, but also survived one of the Odessa pogroms around 1862.[Adler 1999] pp.6‚Äì7 He played hooky; as a 12-year-old he started going to witness public floggings, brandings, and executions of criminals; later he would develop more of an interest in attending courtroom trials.[Adler 1999] pp.13‚Äì14, 30 At 14 he began working in a textile factory, and soon rose to a white collar job there at a salary of 10 rubles a month, which would have been decent even for an adult.[Adler 1999] p.19 Still living at home, he began to frequent the disreputable district of Moldovanka. His first brush with stardom was that he briefly became a boxer, known as Yankele Kulachnik, \\"Jake the Fist\\". He soon got bored with boxing, but not with his new connections to the \\"sons of rich fathers, attorneys without diplomas\\", etc. A good dancer, he became part of a crowd of young toughs who regularly crashed wedding parties. His local celebrity continued, with a reputation as Odessa's best can-can dancer.[Adler 1999] pp.19‚Äì22; ibid., p.29 for Yankele Kulachnik. He left the factory, becoming a raznoschik, a peddler; his memoir hints at back-door assignations with \\"servant girls and chambermaids\\"; by his own description, his life at this point was just a step from a life of crime. Through his uncle Arke, \\"a hot theater lover\\", he became interested in the theater, at first in the beauty of Olga Glebova and the cut of Ivan Kozelsky's clothes, but he had the good fortune to be in one of the great theater cities of his time.[Adler 1999] pp.22‚Äì24 At 17 he became the leader of Glebova's claque, was working as a copyist for lawyers, and going out to a theater, a tavern, or a party every night.[Adler 1999] pp.25, 29, 31 He would later draw on his own life at this time for his portrayal of Protosov in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse.[Adler 1999] p.32 Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother's divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of their possessions and the theft of their money.[Adler 1999] pp.32‚Äì35 In writing about this period in his memoir, Adler mentions attending and admiring performances by Israel Grodner, a Brody singer and improvisational actor who would soon become one of the founders of professional Yiddish theater. A song of Grodner's about an old father turned away by his children would later be the germ of the idea for The Yiddish King Lear. He writes that he would have become a Brody singer, like Grodner, except \\"I had no voice\\".[Adler 1999] p.36 This lack of a singing voice would be a major factor in the direction of his acting career: according to Rosenfeld, although Yiddish theater was long dominated by vaudevilles and operettas, \\"He was the only Yiddish actor to rely entirely on classics and translations of modern European plays.\\"Lulla Rosenfeld, \\"The Yiddish\\", New York Times, June 12, 1977. p. 205. (The quotation is in a continuation on p. 36.) Sanitar and Inspector The outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War brought on universal conscription of young men. At his family's urging, Adler bribed his way into becoming a sanitar, an assistant in the Red Cross Medical Corps. He was selected (apparently on little more than his appearance) by Prince Vladimir Petrovich Meshersky to work at a German hospital in Bender, Moldova, dealing mainly with typhus patients. In his four months there, he became a favorite with the established Jewish families there, and earned a Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement for his brief service to the Tsar.[Adler 1999] pp.43‚Äì53 Returning to Odessa, he got a job distributing newspapers. This respectable work required getting up at 6 a.m., not good for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances‚ÄîIsrael Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family‚Äîhad become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge them to bring their troupe to Odessa.[Adler 1999] pp.54‚Äì55, 59‚Äì61 Adler managed to leverage a recommendation from Prince Meshersky and another from Avrom Markovich Brodsky‚Äîa businessman so successful as to have earned the nickname \\"the Jewish Tsar\\"‚Äîto get a job as a marketplace inspector for the Department of Weights and Measures, rather unusual for a Jew at that time. His mildly corrupt tenure there gave him good contacts with the police. These would soon come in handy for smoothing over certain problems of a young and unlicensed theater troupe when Rosenberg and Spivakofsky returned from Romania, penniless because the end of the war had meant the collapse of Yiddish theater in the provinces, and ready to start a troupe in Odessa.[Adler 1999] pp.71‚Äì73 et.seq., 84‚Äì85 Adler aspired to be an actor, but found himself at first serving the troupe more as critic and theoretician, making use of his now-vast knowledge of Russian theater. The first productions (Goldfaden's Grandmother and Granddaughter and Shmendrick) were popular successes, but Adler's own account suggests that they were basically mediocre, and his Uncle Arke was appalled: \\"Is this theater? No my child, this is a circus.\\"[Adler 1999] pp.76‚Äì97, esp. 82, 96 Acting career Lulla Rosenfeld's remark that Adler \\"...rel[ied] entirely on classics and translations of modern European plays\\" does not quite tell the whole story. On one hand, he was also responsible for recruiting the Yiddish theater's first naturalistic playwright, Jacob Gordin, and he scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin's Der Yiddisher King Lear (The Jewish King Lear), set in 19th-century Russia.[Adler 1999] pp.321‚Äì325 On the other, until his 50s, he was not hesitant to take advantage of his prowess as a dancer, and even occasionally took on roles that called for some singing, although by all accounts (including his own) this was not his forte.Besides the abovementioned \\"I had no voice\\" remark, see Stefan Kanfer, The Yiddish Theater‚Äôs Triumph, City Journal, Spring 2004, which quotes Adler, \\"I was weak as a singer. I had not a good voice nor, I confess it, a very good ear. But is this why I turned from the operetta to purely dramatic plays? I think not. From my earliest years I leaned toward those plays where the actor works not with jests and comic antics, but with the principles of art; not to amuse the public with tumbling, but to awaken in them and in himself the deepest and most powerful emotions.\\" Accessed online February 21, 2007. =Russia= Adler wrote in his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the profession despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky in the title role of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.[Adler 1999] pp.98‚Äì102 His success in the role was cut short by the news that Goldfaden, whose plays they were using without permission, was coming with his troupe to Odessa. Goldfaden's own account says he came there at the urging of his father; Adler attributes it to Rosenberg and Spivakovsky's \\"enemies\\". Rosenberg, never the most ethical of men, withdrew his troupe from Odessa to tour the hinterland. (Soon, though, he would come to an accommodation by which his troupe would be an officially recognized touring company attached to Goldfaden's own troupe.)[Adler 1999] pp. 104, 118] (For greater detail on Adler's time with Rosenberg's company, see Israel Rosenberg.) By his own account, Adler took a leave of absence from his job to travel with Rosenberg's troupe to Kherson, where he made a successful acting debut as the lover Marcus in The Witch of Boto≈üani. He overstayed his leave, lost his government post, and the decision to become a full-time actor was effectively made for him.[Adler 1999] pp.107, 111 Adler was unhappy that under Tulya Goldfaden there were \\"No more communistic shares, no more idealistic comradeship\\". Still, under this same Goldfaden regime he had his first taste of real stardom when people in Chi≈üinƒÉu camped in the courtyards awaiting performances. Even the police seemed to have \\"fallen in love\\" with the troupe, dressing up the actors in their uniforms at riotous parties after shows, while trying on the troupe's costumes themselves.[Adler 1999] p.124 Unsatisfied with the low pay, in Kremenchuk Adler led an unsuccessful actors' strike. A series of intrigues almost led to a breakup with Sonya, but ultimately led both back into Rosenberg's troupe and led to their marriage in Poltava. When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg to form a new one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin.[Adler 1999] pp.138‚Äì157 In Chernigov, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of Boris Gudonov. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to be headed for a triumphant entry into Saint Petersburg.[Adler 1999] pp.168‚Äì170 All that changed with the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant there would be no performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time‚Äîto Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.[Adler 1999] pp. 172‚àí179, 189, 192‚Äì197 In ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Adler triumphantly played the title role in Karl Gutzkow's Uriel Acosta, the first of a series of roles through which he developed a persona he would later call \\"the Grand Jew\\".[Adler 1999] pp.200‚Äì209 After ≈Å√≥d≈∫, they landed in Zhytomyr, under an incompetent investor/director named Hartenstein. They thought they had found \\"a quiet corner\\" of the Russian Empire in which \\"to make a bit of a livelihood\\", but in fact Hartenstein was simply running through his money.[Adler 1999] pp.215‚Äì216 The financial consequences of the collapse of their company were mitigated by a series of three benefit performances, in coordination with the local Russian-language theater company. Sonya returned to Odessa to give birth to their daughter Rivka; Adler stayed on six weeks in Zhytomyr and had sort of a belated apprenticeship with two Russian character actors of national fame, Borisov and Philipovsky. However, he returned to Odessa thinking that he would most likely leave theater behind.[Adler 1999] pp.218‚Äì220 Late in life, when he looked back at his years acting in Adler and Goldfaden's companies, Adler saw it as merely the \\"childhood\\" of his career. He describes his thoughts toward the end of this period, \\"For three years I had wandered in the cave of the Witch in the clown's rags of Shmendrick and what did I really know of my trade?... If someday I return to the Yiddish theater, let me at least not be so ignorant.\\"[Adler 1999] p.218 Returning to Odessa, he discovered that no one would employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to D√ºnaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.[Adler 1999] pp.222‚Äì225 The troupe were left stranded in Riga. Chaikel Bain took ill and died. With some difficulty, passage to London for the troupe was arranged on a cattle ship, in exchange for entertaining the crew. However, about this time Israel Grodner and his wife Annetta reappeared. Adler wanted to include them in the group headed for London. According to Adler, Rosenberg, who played many of the same roles as Israel Grodner, essentially told Adler \\"it's him or me\\". Adler attempted to convince him to change his mind, but insisted on including Grodner in the travel party: Adler considered him one of the best actors in Yiddish theater, a great asset to any performances they would give in London, while he felt Rosenberg lacked depth as an actor. He tried to get Rosenberg to come with them to London, but Rosenberg would not budge.[Adler 1999] pp.93, 225‚Äì229 =London= Jacob Adler Of his time in London, Adler wrote, \\" if Yiddish theater was destined to go through its infancy in Russia, and in America grew to manhood and success, then London was its school.\\"[Adler 1999] p.256 Adler arrived in London with few contacts. In Whitechapel, the center of Jewish London at that time, he encountered extremes of poverty that he describes as exceeding any he had ever seen in Russia or would ever see in New York. The Chief Rabbi of the British Empire at that time, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, was a relative. Adler's father had written him a letter of introduction in Hebrew, but nothing could have been farther from the rabbi's desires than to assist Yiddish-language theater. Nathan Marcus Adler viewed Yiddish as a \\"jargon\\" that existed at the expense of both liturgical Hebrew and the English necessary for upward mobility, and his Orthodox Judaism \\"could not endure so much as a blessing given on stage, for such a blessing would be given in vain\\"; further, he was afraid that the portrayals of Jews on stage would give aid and comfort to their enemies.[Adler 1999] pp.232‚Äì236 At this time, Yiddish theater in London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of professional Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish theater in London to a new level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage. Adler's memoir acknowledges many people who helped him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedler‚Äîa playwright, orchestra leader, and stage manager‚Äîthe Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written on the eve of the Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would continue to play throughout his career.[Adler 1999] pp.239‚Äì246 Two months later, he played Uriel Acosta at the Holborn Theatre to an audience of 500, including the \\"Jewish aristocrats of the West End\\". The piety of the London Jews was such that they had to use an (unplayable) cardboard ram's horn so as to avoid blasphemy. Chief Rabbi Adler and his son and eventual successor Hermann Adler were present, and both, especially the younger rabbi, were favorably impressed. There were even mentions in the English-language press.[Adler 1999] pp.246‚Äì247, 257 Playing to small audiences, on tiny stages, in communal troupes where all but the stars had day jobs, and playing only Saturday and Sunday (the pious London Jews would never have tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater like never before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater in a series of other locations, notably Paris, but eventually came back to London, where Israel Grodner died in 1887.[Adler 1999] pp.248‚Äì251 By November 1885, Adler had a theatrical club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about ¬£3 s.10 a week, but with a fame well out of proportion to the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.[Adler 1999] pp.265‚Äì266, 268 One of Adler's roles from this period was as the villain Franz Moore in Herman Fiedler's adaptation of Schiller's The Robbers, which introduced Schiller into Yiddish theater. On at least one occasion in 1886, he played both Franz Moore and the play's hero, Franz's brother Karl Moore: in the play they never meet.[Adler 1999] pp.282‚Äì283 In 1886, Adler's daughter Rivka died of croup; Sonya died of an infection contracted while giving birth to their son Abram; meanwhile, he had been carrying on an affair with a young woman, Jenny (\\"Jennya\\") Kaiser, who was also pregnant, with his son Charles. Depressed after Sonya's death, he passed up an offer to relocate to the United States, which was taken up instead by Mogulesko and Finkel. In winter 1887, an audience at the Princes Street Club panicked when they thought a simulated stage fire was real; 17 people died in the stampede. While the authorities determined that this was not Adler's fault, and the club was allowed to reopen, the crowds did not return; \\"the theater,\\" he writes, \\"was so cold, dark, and empty you could hunt wolves in the gallery.\\"[Adler 1999] pp.284‚Äì299. Adler does not refer to \\"Jennya\\" by name, but translator/commentator Rosenfeld does. Adler's affair with Jennya continued; he also took up with a young chorus girl from an Orthodox Jewish family, Dinah Shtettin. His memoir is extremely unclear on the sequence of events, and hints at other affairs at this time. The memoir does make clear that the \\"hot-blooded\\" Jennya had little interest in a marriage, while Dinah's father insisted on a marriage, even though he despised Alder and made it clear that he doubted the marriage would last.[Adler 1999] pp.292‚Äì293, 300‚Äì304 =Coming to America= With the aid of a small sum of money from his distant relative the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was glad to see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.[Adler 1999] pp.299‚Äì301, 305‚Äì309 He did not remain long in London. After some major successes in Warsaw, which was under Austrian rule, he returned to London in the spring of 1889, and then again to New York, this time to play for Heine at Poole's Theater. After an initial failure in The Odessa Beggar (he writes that the New York audience of the time was not ready for \\"tragicomedy\\"), he was a success in the melodrama Moishele Soldat, and \\"a more worthy success\\" in Uriel Acosta. This gave him the basis to bring Dinah to America. Their marriage didn't last, though the divorce was amicable: she remarried, to Siegmund Feinman. Adler fell out with Heine, initially over business; at this time Heine's marriage was also falling apart, and Sara Heine would eventually become Sara Adler.[Adler 1999] pp.309‚Äì313 Adler went on the road with Boris Thomashefsky, who at the time was pioneering the touring circuit for Yiddish theater in America. They played in Philadelphia and Chicago, where word arrived of an opportunity to take over Poole's, Heine having moved on to the Thalia. Adler returned to New York, where he managed also to win Mogulesko and Kessler away from Heine.[Adler 1999] pp.313‚Äì315 =New York= Jacob Adler in 1902 Renaming Poole's as the Union Theater, Adler attempted to produce the most serious Yiddish-language theater New York had yet seen in the Yiddish Theater District, with plays such as Scribe's La Juive, Zolotkev's Samson the Great, and Sinckievich's Quo Vadis. However, after Thomashefsky became an enormous popular success in Moses Halevy Horowitz's operetta David ben Jesse at Moishe Finkel's National Theater, the Union Theater temporarily to abandon its highbrow programming and competed head on, with operettas Judith and Holofernes, Titus Andronicus, or the Second Destruction of the Temple, and Hymie in America.[Adler 1999] pp.316‚Äì321 Adler was not content to continue long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out a living as a journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures‚Äîso much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company‚Äîbut The Yiddish King Lear, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness. A photograph of Adler as Shylock in a late 19th century performance of Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. Over the next decades, Adler would play in (or, in some cases, merely produce) numerous plays by Gordin, but also classics by Shakespeare, Schiller, Lessing; Eug√®ne Scribe's La Juive; dramatizations of George du Maurier's Trilby and Alexandre Dumas, fils' Camille; and the works of modern playwrights such as Gorky, Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and Leonid Andreyev. Frequently the works of the great contemporary playwrights‚Äîeven Shaw, who was writing in English‚Äîwould be staged in New York in Yiddish years, even decades, before they were ever staged there in English.[Adler 1999] pp.329‚Äì331 Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the Yiddish stage at the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, directed by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in Yiddish while the rest of the cast spoke in English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare.\\"Yiddish Shylock Viewed...\\" 1903 Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier;[Adler 1999] p.349 quotes this review: \\"A striking and original conception, wrought out not only of careful study, but above all from a racial sympathy, an instinctive appreciation of the deeper motives of this profound and complex character.\\" Several other reviews, favorable and unfavorable, are quoted. in any event the same production was revived two years later.[Adler 1999] p.350 Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as \\"morally superior to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions.\\" In contrast, \\"Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim.\\" In Adler's own words, \\"Shylock from the first was governed by pride rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered at his hands. This is why he goes so far as to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh with a gesture of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed because he has been robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio's death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock I have tried to show.\\" The road from this to method acting is clear. After his two Broadway triumphs, Adler returned to Yiddish theater. In the wake of the Kishinev pogrom, Adler went back briefly to Eastern Europe in summer 1903, where he tried to convince various family members to come to America. Although he was greeted as a hero, he was only partially successful in convincing people to leave; his mother, in particular, was determined to finish out her life where she was. (His father had died some years earlier.) He persuaded his sister Sarah Adler to follow him to America as her husband had died of heart disease in Verdun in 1897 and she was raising seven children on her own. She emigrated in 1905. Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, intending to use it on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 on the condition that he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.[Adler 1999] pp.353‚Äì355, 359 Grand Theatre, some time before 1906. In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater built in what was to be the Yiddish Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first purpose-built Yiddish theater in New York. His wife Sara had branched out to do her own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with an elevator, in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside Drive.) Around this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that Yiddish theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.[Adler 1999] pp.359, 361 This golden age was not to last. The years 1905‚Äì1908 saw half a million new Jewish immigrants to New York, and once again the largest audience for Yiddish theater was for lighter fare. Adler hung on, but the Thomashefskys were making a fortune at the Thalia; plays with titles like Minke the Servant Girl were far outdrawing fare like Gordin's Dementia Americana (1909). It would be 1911 before Adler scored another major success, this time with Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (also known as Redemption), translated into Yiddish by Leon Kobrin.[Adler 1999] pp.361‚Äì364, 367 In 1919‚Äì1920, Adler, despite his own socialist politics, found himself in a labor dispute with the Hebrew Actors' Union; he played that season in London rather than New York. A stroke in 1920 while vacationing in upstate New York nearly ended his acting career, although he continued to appear occasionally, usually as part of a benefit performance for himself, often playing Act I of The Yiddish King Lear: the title character remains seated throughout the entire act. In 1924, he was well enough to perform in the title role of a revival of Gordin's The Stranger, inspired by Tennyson's \\"Enoch Arden\\": the character is \\"a sick and broken man\\", so the Adler was able to integrate his own physical weakness into the portrayal. However, March 31, 1926, he collapsed suddenly, dying almost instantly.[Adler 1999] pp.230 (commentary), 372‚Äì378 (commentary) Family Adler was married three times, first to Sophia (Sonya) Oberlander (died 1886), then to Dinah Shtettin (m. 1887- divorced. 1891) and finally to actress Sara Adler (previously Sara Heine) (m. 1891), who survived him by over 25 years.[Adler 1999], passim., but esp. pp.152‚Äì154, 261, 294‚Äì295, 314, 323 His and Sonya's daughter Rivkah (Rebecca) died at the age of 3. Sonya died from an infection contracted while giving birth to their son Abram in 1886.[Adler 1999] pp.284‚Äì286 Abram's son Allen Adler (1916‚Äì1964) was, among other things, the screenwriter of Forbidden Planet.[Adler 1999] p.386 While still married to Sonya, Adler had an affair with Jenny \\"Jennya\\" Kaiser, with whom he had a son, stage actor Charles Adler (1886‚Äì1966).[Adler 1999] p. 291 et. seq.. Adler does not refer to \\"Jennya\\" by name, but translator/commentator Rosenfeld does. He and Dinah had a daughter, Celia Adler (1889‚Äì1979).[Adler 1999] p.312 He and Sara had six children: the well-known actors Luther (1903‚Äì1984) and Stella Adler (1901‚Äì1992) and the lesser-known actors Jay (1896‚Äì1978), Frances, Julia, and Florence.[Adler 1999] mentions all these children except Florence at least in passing (they are listed in the index, and their relation to him is identified there), but except for Frances and Stella, mentioned in a note on p.230, the book is not explicit that they are Sara's children. The entries for Sara Adler ( at IBDb and on Find-a-grave) list her as the mother of these six, but also incorrectly list her as Charles Adler's mother. Her New York Times obituary (\\"Sarah Adler Dies; Yiddish Stage Star\\", NYT, April 29, 1953, p.29), mentions Luther, Stella, Frances, Julia, and \\"Jack\\" (presumably Jay) as surviving children by Adler; plus stepsons \\"Adolph\\" (presumably Abe) and Charles and stepdaughter Celia; plus her sons Joseph and Max Heine by a former marriage. Jacob and Stella Adler are both members of the American Theater Hall of Fame. His sister Sarah/Soore Adler and her seven children emigrated to New York in 1905. His niece, Francine Larrimore, Sarah's daughter, became a Broadway actress, who also appeared in films.(1) Francine Larrimore, Internet Broadway Data Base, accessed February 21, 2007. (2) Francine Larrimore, Internet Movie Data Base, accessed February 21, 2007. He was also the great-uncle of actor Jerry Adler. Memoir Adler's memoirs were published in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916‚Äì1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916‚Äì1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London,[Adler 1999] passim. although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin.[Adler 1999] p.309 (commentary) It contains only a relatively fragmentary description of his New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary. Adler writes vividly and with humor. He describes the director Hartenstein as \\"a young man from Galicia with long hair and short brains, half educated in Vienna, and half an actor\\", and refers to the poor of Whitechapel as looking as if they \\"had come out of their mothers already gray and old.\\" Of his early London years, he writes, \\"We played for a tiny audience, on a stage the size of a cadaver, but we played well, with a drunkenness of happiness.\\"[Adler 1999] pp.214, 233, 248 In a small essay, \\"Shmendrick, My Mephistopheles\\", one of the last passages he wrote, Adler describes the last time he saw Shmendrick played, at a memorial for Goldfaden in 1912. Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial‚Äî\\"Goldfaden has written better things\\"‚Äîhe nonetheless acknowledges, \\"that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted my teeth. I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... I thank you for the happiness you gave us... I thank you Shmendrick‚Äîmy beloved‚Äîmy own.\\"[Adler 1999] pp.365‚Äì367 See also *Solomon the Wise, 1906 play starring Adler Notes References Oxford Dictionary of National Biography External links Accessed September 29, 2006.

History  = 1950s = VF-41 was established on 1 September 1950 at NAS Oceana, it is the fourth US Navy squadron to be designated VF-41. The Black Aces began flying the F2H-3 Banshee in 1953, deploying to the Mediterranean and Far East aboard .

In May 1965, the squadron deployed to the western Pacific for seven months of combat operations during the Vietnam War. They flew a wide range of missions: fighter cover, reconnaissance escort, flak suppression and day/night interdiction. = 1970s = F-4J on The next five deployments (flying the F-4J,B,N) were on with CVW-6 tail code AE (awarded the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation for period March 9, 1972 through December 1, 1972). VF-41 transitioned from the F-4B to the F-4J in 1973 and (as an 18 aircraft squadron) was on USS Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Yom Kippur War providing escorts for Operation Nickel Grass and were part of the peacekeeping force that helped keep the truce after the war. In 1974, VF-41 transitioned from the F-4J to the F-4N and conducted their last cruise with the Phantom aboard Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1975. During that year VF-41 was awarded the COMNAVAIRLANT Safety \\"S\\", which they also would receive in 1981, 1989 and 1992. In April 1976 VF-41 transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat and their first cruise began in September 1977 as part of CVW-8 on . Another cruise followed in 1980 to the Mediterranean. = 1980s = F-14 Tomcats involved in the Gulf of Sidra incident, on the deck of In 1980, Nimitz and VF-41 took part in a round-the-Horn cruise. While on this cruise, the carrier served as the seaborne base in response to the Iran hostage crisis and the subsequent attempted rescue of the U.S. Embassy hostages from Iran. VF-41 (and the rest of the battle group) spent 144 continuous days at sea, the longest period the squadron had spent at sea without break since World War II. During workups for the 1981‚Äì1982 Mediterranean cruise, an EA-6B Prowler piloted by Marine Lieut. Steven E. White, crashed on the deck of Nimitz. Upon crashing onto the deck, the Prowler rammed broadside into six fueled F-14 Tomcats causing a fuel fire and ordnance to explode, including an AIM-7 Sparrow missile. The incident, which caused only superficial damage to Nimitz, resulted in three F-14s destroyed, 45 injured sailors and fourteen casualties with VF-41 losing three shipmates. While on deployment in the Mediterranean on August 19, 1981, during a routine combat air patrol mission over the Gulf of Sidra, two Libyan Su-22 \\"Fitter\\" aircraft were shot down by squadron aircraft. The incident marked the first Navy air combat confrontation since the Vietnam War and the first ever for the F-14A Tomcat. It was the first time a variable wing geometry aircraft shot down another variable wing geometry aircraft. 1981 was also the first year in which the squadron won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency \\"E\\", signifying them as the most efficient squadron in the Atlantic Fleet. VF-41 was also awarded the Battle \\"E\\" in 1985 and 1989. In November 1982, the squadron embarked on an extended deployment off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, in support of the Multinational Force in Lebanon. During 1985, VF-41 spent 68 days off the coast of Lebanon in response to the hijacking of TWA Flight 847. The 1986 cruise was the last with Nimitz; it began in December and ended in June 1987 when Nimitz got to her new home in San Diego. In October that year, CVW-8 was deployed with and the first cruise was in the North Atlantic for Exercise Teamwork ‚Äô88 which involved operations with the Royal Norwegian Air Force and the first Mediterranean deployment was in December. = 1990s = On December 28, 1990, VF-41 embarked on to support Operation Desert Shield, arriving in the Persian Gulf shortly after hostilities with Iraq began. By the end of the war, the squadron had amassed over 1,500 combat flight hours. After the war, the squadron remained in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea as part of a military presence enforcing the ceasefire until late April 1991, when the squadron was tasked with providing air support for ground forces assisting Kurdish refugees in Northern Iraq during Operation Provide Comfort. VF-41 was soon training for the F-14's new role: air-to-ground bombing. In late 1991, VF-41 had flown over 46,500 hours without an accident over a period of 11 years. In 1995 VF-84 was disestablished and VF-41 picked up the TARPS mission. The disestablishment of VF-84 was the only occasion in which a TARPS capable unit was disestablished instead of a non-TARPS capable unit. In early 1995 VF-41 deployed on a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf and the Adriatic Sea. During this cruise VF-41 conducted combat operations in support of Operation Deliberate Force and Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia and Herzegovina and Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. On September 5, 1995, two VF-41 F-14As dropped laser-guided bombs for the first time in combat during Operation Deliberate Force. The target was an ammunition dump in eastern Bosnia. The bombs were guided by F/A-18s. VF-41 adopted the slogan \\"First To Fight, First To Strike\\" in recognition of being the first F-14 squadron to score air-to-air kills and drop bombs in combat. During this deployment VF-41 logged over 600 combat hours and 530 sorties, and during a week of combat in the Balkans (September 5-12 1995), VF-41 dropped 24,000 pounds of ordnance on Bosnian-Serb targets, the bulk of it precision guided bombs laser designated by F/A-18 Hornets.Tony Holmes (2015), p. 17 In 1996, VF-14 joined VF-41 in CVW-8 and thus CVW-8 was one of few air wings in the US Navy with two F-14 squadrons, rather than one. CVW-8 deployed on board in February 1996, for a Joint Fleet Exercise. This was followed by deployed operations to the North Atlantic while embarked on with port calls to Dublin, Ireland and Portsmouth, England. In April 1997, CVW-8 embarked on USS John F. Kennedy for a Mediterranean/Persian Gulf deployment. During this deployment, CVW-8 participated in numerous exercises and detachments including Infinite Acclaim, Beacon Flash and Invitex. During Invitex the Air Wing completed over 350 sorties including 203 sorties in a single day of surge operations. This deployment also included operations over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Deliberate Guard and over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch. In 1999, USS Theodore Roosevelt departed for the Mediterranean and joined NATO forces for Operation Allied Force. VF-41's first strike was against an ammunition storage facility in Pristina, Kosovo on April 6. In July, Theodore Roosevelt was ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, where VF-41 became the first squadron to expend ordnance in two theatres on a single deployment. VF-41 logged over 1,100 combat hours during 384 sorties and dropped over 160 tons of laser-guided munitions with an unprecedented 85% success rate in support of Operation Allied Force and Operation Southern Watch.Grumman F-14 Tomcat 1976‚Äì2001 The squadron won the Wade McClusky Award in 1999, as most outstanding attack squadron in the US Navy. This marked the first time an F-14 squadron won the award, which previously been given only to A-6 and F/A-18 units. = 2000s = In April 2001, VF-41 embarked on their final F-14 cruise aboard , supporting Operation Southern Watch and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). As the carrier headed for home, they were given order to head to the Gulf of Oman after the September 11 attacks. During the build-up to war, VF-41 conducted several TARPS missions near the Pakistani/Afghani-border. USS Enterprise and its air group was the night carrier during OEF and thus did not see action until October 8, when VF-41 attacked several cave complexes. One of the first target hit was the Shindand airbase, in western Afghanistan, where the Taliban were storing aircraft, radar and vehicles. By the end of the deployment in November, VF-41 had dropped over 200,000 lbs of ordnance (202 laser-guided bombs). Shortly after their return in late 2001, VF-41 transitioned to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and was redesignated VFA-41. F/A-18F over Afghanistan On October 18, 2002 four VFA-41 aviators were killed when two F/A-18Fs collided in mid-air off the coast of California. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, two F/A-18Fs were forward deployed to in late March 2003. These F/A-18s were requested to boost the aerial refueling capabilities of CVW-14, as well as to provide additional qualified Forward Air Controllers. The F/A-18s flew from Nimitz to Abraham Lincoln, a 2700-mile trip. On April 6, the Hornets returned to Nimitz. During the war VFA-41 expended laser-guided bombs, as well as JDAM and AGM-65 Maverick missiles. In May 2005 VFA-41 again deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this deployment the squadron was featured in the PBS documentary \\"Carrier\\" with a heavy focus on Commander David Fravor. In 2007 VFA-41 deployed aboard Nimitz for a WESTPAC cruise and participated in Operation Valiant Shield, a joint-force exercise in the vicinity of Guam. In January 2008 the squadron surge-deployed to Nimitz in the Pacific. On February 13, 2008, it was reported that several Russian Tu-95 bombers were intercepted over the Pacific by F/A-18s from Nimitz while on a surge deployment in the region. One Tu-95 was escorted and flew directly over the carrier at , escorted by VFA-41 Hornets. The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm.

The original shooting title was Orgy of the Blood Parasites.  Plot  At Starliner Towers, a luxury apartment complex outside of Montreal, Dr. Emil Hobbes murders a young woman named Annabelle. He slices open her stomach, pours acid into the wound and then commits suicide. Nick Tudor, who has been suffering from stomach convulsions, finds their bodies but leaves without calling the police. The two bodies are found by resident doctor Roger St. Luc, who calls the police. Hobbes' medical partner, Rollo Linsky, tells St. Luc that he and Hobbes had been working on a project to create: \\"a parasite that can take over the function of a human organ\\". After suffering more convulsions, Nick leaves work early. He vomits a parasite over the railing of his balcony. The parasite slithers back into the apartment, where it attacks a cleaning woman in the basement, attaching itself to her face. His wife Janine tries to care for him, but he ignores her and prefers to talk to the parasites undulating in his abdomen. At the clinic, Roger sees a sexually active middle-aged resident who has been suffering from stomach convulsions. Roger postulates that his condition might be an STD that he caught from Annabelle. Linsky calls Roger from Hobbes' office downtown to tell him that Hobbes had developed a parasite that was \\"a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will, hopefully, turn the world into one mindless orgy\\". Hobbes believed modern humans had become over-intellectual and estranged from their primal impulses. Hobbes' ambition with his parasitic invention was to reassert humanity's unbridled, sexually aggressive instincts, and he used Annabelle as his guinea pig. Linsky warns Roger not to approach anyone who is behaving in a strange manner. Nick tries to force Janine to have sex with him, but she recoils in horror when one of the parasites crawls from his mouth. She rushes to the apartment of her lesbian friend Betts, who was infected by one of the parasites while taking a bath. Betts seduces Janine and passes a parasite to her. Meanwhile, other residents become infected with the parasite, attack other residents and continue to spread the infection. Soon the hallways are full of people sexually assaulting or fighting one another. Roger combs the complex looking for the parasites while Forsythe, his nurse and lover, tends to an elderly couple who were attacked by one of the parasites. Linsky arrives at Starliner Towers and goes to the Tudor apartment, as Roger had identified Nick as someone Annabelle might have infected. He finds Nick lying in bed, parasites crawling on his abdomen. When Linksy examines more closely, one of the parasites latches onto his cheek. Linsky tries to pull it off with pliers, but Nick kills him and swallows the parasite. Forsythe tries to flee the complex in her car but is attacked by the infected security guard. Before he can rape her, Roger arrives and kills him, and the two hide in the basement. Forsythe tells Roger of a dream that mixed eroticism and death, then vomits up a parasite. Roger knocks her out and tries to carry her to safety, but they are attacked by a horde of infected sex maniacs. Roger drops Forsythe to flee for his own safety, and she is overwhelmed by the infected. Roger kills Nick in his apartment, then tries to escape the complex via the swimming pool area. The infected block his path, and he is pulled into the pool by Janine and Betts. The rest of the infected hold Roger down while Forsythe infects him too. Roger, Forsythe and the other Starlight residents drive out of the building's garage. Early the next morning, news reports encourage listeners not to panic as police investigate an epidemic of sexual assaults in Montreal.  Cast   Production  Shivers was Cronenberg's first feature film, and was the most profitable Canadian film made to date in 1975, but was so controversial that the Parliament of Canada debated its social and artistic value and effect upon society, because of objections to its sexual and violent content. The film was shot on Nuns' Island in Montreal, with a shooting schedule of fifteen days.  Release  Shivers opened theatrically in the United States under the alternate title They Came From Within, with regional showings beginning in San Antonio, Texas on September 26, 1975. The film was released in Montr√©al on October 10, 1975 where it was distributed by Cin√©pix. The film was released in Canada as The Parasite Murders and in both Canada and the United Kingdom as Shivers. The film was released in the United States as They Came From Within. The film was released on DVD by Image Entertainment on September 16, 1998 and is currently out of print.  Reception  On its initial release, Shivers was not a positively received film. Of a selection of 28 reviews from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium and France, 16 reviews are negative, six were positive and the rest could be classified as neutral. From the negative reviews, 12 of the 16 negative reviews are very negative while three of the six positive reviews were very positive. Canadian journalist Robert Fulford, writing as \\"Marshall Delaney\\", decried the content of Shivers in the pages of the national magazine Saturday Night. Since Cronenberg's film was partially financed by the taxpayer-funded Canadian Film Development Corporation (later known as Telefilm Canada), Fulford headlined the article \\"You should know how bad this film is. After all, you paid for it.\\" He called it \\"crammed with blood, violence and depraved sex\\" and \\"the most repulsive movie I've ever seen.\\" Not only did this high- profile attack make it more difficult for Cronenberg to obtain funding for his subsequent movies, but Cronenberg later said Fulford's article also resulted in him being kicked out of his apartment in Toronto, owing to his landlord's inclusion of a \\"morality clause\\" in the lease.Le cin√©ma de David Cronenberg et la peinture de Francis Bacon ‚Äì Regards crois√©s Other Canadian critics gave the film negative reviews, such as Martin Knelman in The Globe and Mail and Dane Larnken in Montreal Gazette. American critic Roger Ebert, who noted that he expected a dismal exploitation film since Shivers was part of a double-bill with the faux-snuff film Snuff, but instead was impressed by a lot of the film and ended up giving it a two-and-a-half-star rating. The film was one of the highest-grossing English-language Canadian films of all-time with a gross of $1 million in Canada.

Situated in the Las Khorey District, it is notable as the historic capital of the Warsangali Sultanate. History Ruins of the Warsangali Sultanate in Las Khorey. The Las Khorey settlement is several centuries old. Between the town and El Ayo lies Karinhegane, the site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each painting has an inscription below it, which collectively have been estimated to be around 2,500 years old. Around 25 miles from Las Khorey is found Gelweita, another key rock art site. Karinhegane's rock art is in the same distinctive Ethiopian-Arabian style as the Laas Gaal cave paintings. Beginning in the early Middle Ages, Las Khorey served as the capital of the Warsangali Sultanate (Maakhir Coast Sultanate)'s ruling dynasty, including the influential Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire. Sultan Shire administered his Sultanate from a large two-storey palace (Sha‚Äôa) in the city. He also maintained a fortress, which, though now mostly in ruins, still remains an important historical structure.Mohamoud Ali Shire.htm A Touching Glimpse of History and the Reunion of a Somali Royalty Northern Somalia in general is home to numerous such archaeological sites, with similar edifices found at Haylan, Qa‚Äôableh, Qombo'ul and El Ayo.

The polity was later officially incorporated into Puntland state in January 2009.Worldstatesmen - Maakhir Economy Cans of Las Qoray brand tuna made in Las Khorey. Las Khorey is a city that is booming and experiencing a period of rapid growth as new small factories are being created and opened, including a fish factory. As with other cities and districts in the Sanaag region, Las Khorey's commercial and labor sectors were historically neglected by several of Somalia's various federal administrations, with the town's population count consequently plummeting. However, this trend appears to be reversing, as many people have begun working in the city's new factories. Another reason for the growth in population is that after the civil war broke out, Somalis from the Warsangali sub-clan of the Darod began migrating back to their traditional strongholds in northern Somalia, including Las Khorey. The city is also surrounded by a mountain range referred to locally as Cal Madow, which reportedly has valuable but as yet unexploited mineral deposits. This is in addition to the area's overall unique natural habitat. Transportation The old port in Las Khorey is undergoing extensive renovations. Las Khorey has a jetty-class seaport, the Port of Las Khorey. Horn Relief (now Adeso), an organization founded by Somali environmentalist Fatima Jibrell, began a project for the redevelopment of the 400-year-old seaport. The initiative was later taken up by Faisal Hawar, CEO of the Maakhir Resource Company. In 2012, he brokered an agreement with a Greek investment firm for the development of the commercial Las Khorey Port. A team of engineers was subsequently enlisted by the Puntland authorities to assess the ongoing renovations taking place at the seaport.Somalia: Somaliland naval forces attack crew in Sanaag region According to the Minister of Ports, Saeed Mohamed Ragge, the Puntland government intends to launch more such development projects in Las Khorey.

It is a subsidiary of Trilogy, Inc. History Versata started in the early 1990s as a software consulting company called Vision Software. Over time it developed and sold software for Microsoft Visual Basic development market. Around 1994, it began development of an integrated development environment for applications. It included a GUI builder and a business rules engine that enabled developers to create a Web application rapidly using MS SQL Server or Oracle in the backend. The product, called Vision Jade, was released around 1997. It was enhanced to support three tier applications and Java thin clients. Vision Software changed its key product and company name to Versata, went public in March 2000 and, on that day, was worth an astonishing $4 billion‚Äîastonishing considering that the company had revenues of about $60 million and was losing a lot of money; but this was during the Dot-com bubble. Despite hard times, Versata has managed to stay alive and maintain its customer base. In November 2000, Versata expanded into the business workflow area with the acquisition of Verve, Inc.. From early 2001 through mid-2003 Versata's revenues were in quarter over quarter decline until Alan Baratz took over as CEO. Five consecutive quarters of growth followed until early 2005 when revenues once again took a downward plunge. Mid-2005 the company was notified by NASDAQ that it no longer met NASDAQ's requirements for continued listing, related to maintenance of a minimum amount of shareholder's equity, market value, or net income. Rather than continue to focus on these requirements, the company decided to move to the OTC (also known as the Pink Sheets) in order to remain publicly traded. On 7 December 2005, Versata announced that Austin based Trilogy, Inc. had made an offer to acquire the company by tender. That deal was consummated in February 2006, taking the company private. Trilogy then proceeded to merge portions of Trilogy, specifically, Trilogy Technology Group, into Versata and began acquiring further companies, reorganizing dramatically and offshoring most technical positions to its office in Bangalore, India. From 2006 to 2008, Versata continued to make acquisitions mostly in US. Most of the employees in the acquired companies were laid -off with the majority work being offshored to its India office in Bangalore. In early 2009, Versata made another major overhaul of its business model when it asked all its employees in India to work as contractors through oDesk for a gDev which is an entity incorporated by Trilogy to manage its outsourcing activities. The only employees left in Versata were the ones in US. A jury in the Eastern District of Texas awarded Versata Software $139m following its decision that SAP infringed two of Versata's patents - U.S. Patent No. 6,553,350 and U.S. Patent No. 5,878,400.

The Gemonian Stairs (, ) were a flight of steps located in the ancient city of Rome. Nicknamed the Stairs of Mourning, the stairs are infamous in Roman history as a place of execution.  Location  Via S. Pietro in Carcere close to the Campidoglio The steps were situated in the central part of Rome, leading from the Arx of the Capitoline Hill down to the Roman Forum. As viewed from the Forum, they passed down the Tabularium and the Temple of Concord on the left side, and past the Mamertine Prison on the right side.Platner (1929). A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, Scalae Gemoniae, p466. London. Oxford University Press. It is believed that the location of the steps roughly coincides with the current Via di San Pietro in Carcere, past the ruins of the Mamertine prison. It is believed the stairs were built some time before the rule of Tiberius (14‚Äì37), as they were not mentioned by name in any ancient texts that predate this period.One of the earliest references comes from Tacitus, Annals Book 3, 14 Their first use as a place of execution is primarily associated with the rumoured paranoid excesses of Tiberius' later reign.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 61  Executions  The condemned were usually strangled before their bodies were bound and thrown down the stairs. Occasionally the corpses of the executed were transferred here for display from other places of execution in Rome. Corpses were usually left to rot on the staircase for extended periods of time in full view of the Forum, scavenged by dogs or other carrion animals, until eventually being thrown into the Tiber. Death on the stairs was considered extremely dishonourable and dreadful, yet several senators and even an emperor met their demise here. Among the most famous who were executed on this spot were the prefect of the Praetorian Guard Lucius Aelius Sejanus and the emperor Vitellius. Sejanus was a former confidant of emperor Tiberius who was implicated in a conspiracy in AD 31. According to Cassius Dio, Sejanus was strangled and cast down the Gemonian stairs, where the mob abused his corpse for three days.Cassius Dio, Roman History LVIII.11 Soon after, his three children were similarly executed in this place. Vitellius was a Roman general who became the third emperor in the so-called Year of the Four Emperors in AD 69. He succeeded Otho upon his suicide on April 16, but lived to be emperor for only eight months. When his armies were defeated by those of Vespasian he agreed to surrender, but the Praetorian Guard refused to let him leave the city. On the entrance of Vespasian's troops into Rome he was dragged out of his hiding place, driven to the Gemonian stairs and struck down. His last words were \\"Yet I was once your Emperor\\".Tacitus, Histories III.84, III.85 On those same stairs, Decebalus's head was thrown along with his right hand in 106 AD.  Similar places  During Republican times, the Tarpeian Rock, a steep cliff at the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill, was used for similar purposes. Murderers and traitors, if convicted by the quaestores parricidii, were flung from the cliff to their deaths. Infants who suffered from significant mental or physical disabilities sometimes suffered the same fate, as they were thought to have been cursed by the gods.

She is best known for her work of the Weimar period, when she was one of the originators of photomontage. Photomontage, or fotomontage, is a type of collage in which the pasted items are actual photographs, or photographic reproductions pulled from the press and other widely produced media. H√∂ch's work was intended to dismantle the fable and dichotomy that existed in the concept of the \\"New Woman\\": an energetic, professional, and androgynous woman, who is ready to take her place as man's equal. Her interest in the topic was in how the dichotomy was structured, as well as in who structures social roles. Other key themes in H√∂ch's works were androgyny, political discourse, and shifting gender roles. These themes all interacted to create a feminist discourse surrounding H√∂ch's works, which encouraged the liberation and agency of women during the Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì1933) and continuing through to today. Biography Hannah H√∂ch was born Anna Therese Johanne H√∂chBiro 2009, p. 199. in Gotha, Germany. Although she attended school, domesticity took precedence in the H√∂ch household. In 1904, H√∂ch was taken out of the H√∂here T√∂chterschule in Gotha to care for her youngest sibling, Marianne. In 1912 she began classes at the colledge of Applied Arts in Berlin under the guidance of glass designer Harold Bergen.Makela 1994, p. 13 She chose the curriculum in glass design and graphic arts, rather than fine arts, to please her father. In 1914, at the start of World War I, she left the school and returned home to Gotha to work with the Red Cross.Makela 1994, p. 49 In 1915 she returned to Berlin, where she entered the graphics class of Emil Orlik at the National Institute of the Museum of Arts and Crafts.Gaze 1997, p. 699 Also in 1915, H√∂ch began an intimate relationship with Raoul Hausmann, a member of the Berlin Dada movement. H√∂ch's involvement with the Berlin Dadaists began in earnest in 1917. H√∂ch, as the only woman among the Berlin group, was singled out for her self-sufficiency, masculine presentation, and bisexuality, as she consistently addressed themes of the \\"New Woman\\" free to vote, free to enjoy sexual encounters and begin them, and free financially. From 1916 to 1926, she worked in the handicrafts department for the publisher Ullstein Verlag, designing dress, embroidery, lace, and handiwork designs for Die Dame (The Lady) and Die Praktische Berlinerin (The Practical Berlin Woman). The influence of this early work and training can be seen in a number of her collages made in the late 1910s and early- to mid-1920s in which she incorporated sewing patterns and needlework designs. From 1926 to 1929 she lived and worked in the Netherlands. H√∂ch formed many influential friendships and professional relationships over the years with individuals such as Kurt Schwitters, Nelly van Doesburg, Theo van Doesburg, Sonia Delaunay, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, and Piet Mondrian, among others. H√∂ch, along with Hausmann, was one of the first pioneers of the art form that would come to be known as photomontage. Hannah H√∂ch, Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Beer- Belly of the Weimar Republic, 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90 x 144 cm, Staatliche Museen, Berlin =Personal life and relationships= Art historian Maria Makela has characterized H√∂ch's affair with Raoul Hausmann as \\"stormy\\", and identifies the central cause of their altercations‚Äîsome of which ended in violence‚Äîin Hausmann's refusal to leave his wife. He reached the point of fantasizing about killing H√∂ch.Maria Makela (1996). \\"By Design: The Early Work of Hannah H√∂ch in Context\\". In Boswell, Peter; Makela, Maria; Lanchner, Carolyn (eds.). The photomontages of Hannah H√∂ch (1. ed.). Minneapolis: Walker Art Center. p. 64. . Hausmann continually disparaged H√∂ch not only for her desire to marry him, which he described as a \\"bourgeois\\" inclination, but also for her opinions on art. Hausmann's hypocritical stance on women's emancipation spurred H√∂ch to write \\"a caustic short story\\" entitled \\"The Painter\\" in 1920, the subject of which is \\"an artist who is thrown into an intense spiritual crisis when his wife asks him to do the dishes.\\" Hausmann repeatedly implied that the only way H√∂ch could reach full potential, as a woman and in their relationship, was to have a child with him. H√∂ch herself wanted children, but both times she found she was pregnant with Hausmann's child, in May 1916 and January 1918, she had an abortion. H√∂ch ended her seven-year relationship with Raoul Hausmann in 1922. In 1926, she began a relationship with the Dutch writer and linguist Mathilda ('Til') Brugman, who H√∂ch met through mutual friends Kurt and Helma Schwitters. By autumn of 1926, H√∂ch moved to The Hague to live with Brugman, where they lived until 1929, at which time they moved to Berlin. H√∂ch and Brugman's relationship lasted nine years, until 1935. They did not explicitly define their relationship as lesbian (likely because they did not feel it necessary or desirable), instead choosing to refer to it as a private love relationship.Lavin, Maud. \\"The New Woman in Hannah H√∂ch's Photomontages: Issues of Androgyny, Bisexuality, and Oscillation.\\" in Reclaiming Female Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism, edited by Norma Broude and Mary D. Garrard (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 2005), 324‚Äì41. In 1935, H√∂ch began a relationship with Kurt Matthies, to whom she was married from 1938 to 1944. =Later years= H√∂ch in 1974 Hannah H√∂ch's Gardenhouse, Berlin, Germany H√∂ch spent the years of the Third Reich in Berlin, Germany, keeping a low profile. She was the last member of the Berlin Dada group to remain in Germany during this period. She bought and lived in a small garden house in Berlin- Heiligensee, a remote area on the outskirts of Berlin. She married businessman and pianist Kurt Matthies in 1938 and divorced him in 1944. She suffered from the Nazi censorship of art, and her work was deemed \\"degenerate art\\", which made it even more difficult for her to show her works. Though her work was not acclaimed after the war as it had been before the rise of the Third Reich, she continued to produce her photomontages and exhibit them internationally until her death in 1978, in Berlin. Her house and garden can be visited at the annual Day of the Memorials (Tag des offenen Denkmals). The 128th anniversary of her birthday was commemorated on 1 November 2017 by a Google Doodle.\\"Hannah H√∂ch's 128th Birthday\\", Google Doodles Archive  Dada  Dada was an artistic movement formed in 1915 in Zurich, Switzerland. The movement rejected monarchy, militarism, and conservatism and was enmeshed in an \\"anti-art\\" sentiment. Dadaists felt that art should have no boundaries or restrictions and that it can be whimsical and playful. These sentiments arose after the Great War, which caused society to question the role of government, and to reject militarism after seeing the atrocities of war. Many Dada pieces were critical of the Weimar Republic and its failed attempt at creating a democracy in post-war (WWI) Germany. The Dada movement had a tone of fundamental negativity in regards to bourgeois society. The term \\"dada\\" has no actual meaning ‚Äì it is a childlike word used to describe the lack of reason or logic in much of the artwork. The main artists involved in the movement include George Grosz, John Heartfield and Raoul Hausmann. Some claim that it was H√∂ch's relationship with Hausmann that allowed her into the sphere of Dada artists. George Grosz and John Heartfield were against H√∂ch exhibiting with them in the 1920 First International Dada Fair, and only allowed her participation after Raoul Hausmann argued for her inclusion. Hausmann, however, still attempted to deny H√∂ch a place in the movement, by writing in his memoirs that \\"she was never a member of the club.\\" She nonetheless held the title of ‚ÄúDadasophin‚Äú within the movement.Gaby Pailer, Andreas B√∂hn, Ulrich Scheck, Stefan Horlacher (editors); Gender and Laughter: Comic Affirmation and Subversion in Traditional and Modern Media; Amsterdamer Beitrage Zur Neueren Germanistik (Book 70); Rodopi (October 16, 2009); p. 125 H√∂ch is best known for her photomontages. These collages, which borrowed images from popular culture and utilized the dismemberment and reassembly of images, fit well with the Dada aesthetic, though other Dadaists were hesitant to accept her work due to inherent sexism in the movement. Her work added \\"a wryly feminist note\\" to the Dadaist philosophy of disdain towards bourgeois society, but both her identity as a woman and her feminist subject matter contributed to her never being fully accepted by the male Dadaists. Like other Dada artists, H√∂ch's work also came under close scrutiny by the Nazis as it was considered degenerate. The Nazis put her 1932 intended exhibition at the Bauhaus (a German art school) to a stop. They were not only offended by her aesthetic, but also by her political messages and by the mere fact that she was a woman. Her images portrayed androgynous individuals, which the Nazis despised. Nazi ideology appreciated artwork that portrayed the ideal Aryan German man and woman. The images H√∂ch used often contrasted this look, or used it to make a point about society (such as in the piece \\"the Beautiful Girl\\"). The Nazis preferred a traditional clear rational style of artwork that did not require deep thought or analysis. They felt that the chaos of the Dada style bordered on pathological. H√∂ch went into seclusion during this dark period in human history and was later able to return to the art world after the fall of the Third Reich. = Photomontage = \\"H√∂ch's photomontages display the chaos and combustion of Berlin's visual culture from a particularly female perspective\\" (Makholm). \\"H√∂ch was not only a rare female practicing prominently in the arts in the early part of the twentieth century‚Äînear unique as a female active in the Dada movement that coalesced in her time‚Äîshe also consciously promoted the idea of women working creatively more generally in society. She explicitly addressed in her pioneering artwork in the form of photomontage the issue of gender and the figure of woman in modern society\\" (The Art Story). In these montages, H√∂ch gathered images and text from popular forms of media, such as newspapers and magazines, and combined them in often uncanny ways, which were able to express her stances on the important social issues of her time. The fact that images she included in her pieces were pulled from current newspapers and magazines gave her messages validity. The power of the works came from the intentional dismemberment and reconstruction of the images. This alludes to the notion that current issues can be viewed through different lenses. This technique was originally thought of as extremely leftist and revolutionary, but by the 1930s, it had become an accepted mode of design linked with modernity and consumerism. Thus began the notion that mass culture and fine arts could be combined in a meaningful way. The ambiguity in her work was integral to the way which she addressed issues of sexuality and gender. These complex constructions of genders allow women to embrace both their masculine and feminine attributes. This leads to an intensified sense of individualism. Photomontage is a large part of H√∂ch's legacy as an artist. = Women In Dada = While the Dadaists, including Georg Schrimpf, Franz Jung, and Johannes Baader, \\"paid lip service to women's emancipation,\\" they were clearly reluctant to include a woman among their ranks. Hans Richter described H√∂ch's contribution to the Dada movement as the \\"sandwiches, beer and coffee she managed somehow to conjure up despite the shortage of money.\\" Raoul Hausmann even suggested that H√∂ch get a job to support him financially, despite her being the only one from her close circle to have a stable income. On her exclusion and the sexism of the Dadaists, H√∂ch responded, \\"None of these men were satisfied with just an ordinary woman. But neither were they included to abandon the (conventional) male/masculine morality toward the woman. Enlightened by Freud, in protest against the older generation. . . they all desired this ‚ÄòNew Woman‚Äô and her groundbreaking will to freedom. But‚Äîthey more or less brutally rejected the notion that they, too, had to adopt new attitudes. . . This led to these truly Strinbergian dramas that typified the private lives of these men.‚Äù H√∂ch was the lone woman among the Berlin Dada group, although Sophie Taeuber, Beatrice Wood, and Baroness Else von Freytag-Loringhoven were also important, if overlooked, Dada figures. H√∂ch references the hypocrisy of the Berlin Dada group and German society as a whole in her photomontage, Da-Dandy. H√∂ch also wrote about the hypocrisy of men in the Dada movement in her short essay \\"The Painter\\", published in 1920, in which she portrays a modern couple that embraces gender equality in their relationship, a novel and shocking concept for the time. This is an example of how H√∂ch was able to transcend one particular medium and convey her social ideals in many forms. H√∂ch's time at Ullstein Verlag working with magazines targeted at women made her acutely aware of the difference between women as portrayed in media and their reality, and her workplace provided her with many of the images that served as raw material for her own work. She was also critical of the institution of marriage, often depicting brides as mannequins and children, reflecting the socially pervasive idea of women as incomplete people with little control over their lives. H√∂ch worked for the magazine Ullstein Verlag between 1916 and 1926 in the department which focused on design patterns, handicrafts, knitting and embroidery, artistic forms within the domestic sphere which were considered appropriate for women. \\"The pattern designs H√∂ch created for Ullstein's women's magazines and her early experiments with modernist abstraction were integrally related, blurring the boundaries between traditionally masculine and feminine modes of form and expression\\" (Makholm). She wrote a Manifesto of Modern Embroidery in 1918, which spoke to the modern woman, empowering her to take pride in her work. \\"She now drew on this experience and on a large body of advertising material she had collected, in images that were unprecedented in their insights into the way society 'constructs' women\\" (Hudson). H√∂ch considered herself a part of the women's movement in the 1920s, as shown in her depiction of herself in Schnitt mit dem K√ºchenmesser DADA durch die letzte Weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands (1919‚Äì20). Her pieces also commonly combine male and female traits into one unified being. During the era of the Weimar Republic, \\"mannish women were both celebrated and castigated for breaking down traditional gender roles.\\"Makela 1994, p. 20. In this artwork Hoch metaphorically equates her scissors, used to cut images or her collages, to the kitchen knife. This is used to symbolize cutting through the dominant domains of politics and public life in Weimer culture. Her androgynous characters may also have been related to her bisexuality and attraction to masculinity in women (that is, attraction to the female form paired with stereotypically masculine characteristics). Works Siegfried K√ºhl, Der archaische Erz-Engel vom Heiligense, 1989, sculpture in homage to Hannah H√∂ch in Berlin-Reinickendorf H√∂ch was a pioneer of the art form that became known as photomontage and of the Dada movement. Many of her pieces sardonically critiqued the mass culture beauty industry of the time, then gaining significant momentum in mass media through the rise of fashion and advertising photography. Many of her political works from the Dada period equated women's liberation with social and political revolution.Maud Lavin, \\"Androgyny, Spectatorship, and the Weimar Photomontages of Hannah H√∂ch\\", New German Critique, No. 51, Special Issue on Weimar Mass Culture (Autumn, 1990), pp. 62‚Äì86: Duke University Press: Her work displays the chaos and combustion of Berlin's visual culture from the female perspective. In particular, her photomontages often critically addressed the Weimar New Woman, collating images from contemporary magazines.Juliet Koss,\\"Bauhaus Theater of Human Dolls\\", The Art Bulletin, December 2003; 85, 4 Her works from 1926 to 1935 often depicted same-sex couples, and women were once again a central theme in her work from 1963 to 1973. Her most often used technique was to fuse together male and female bodies. This fusion existed in order to give the attributed power of a man to a woman, as well as blur the lines of gender attributed actions. She also used historically feminine mediums such as embroidery and lace in her collages to highlight gendered associations. H√∂ch also made strong statements on racial discrimination. Her most famous piece is Schnitt mit dem K√ºchenmesser DADA durch die letzte Weimarer Bierbauchkulturepoche Deutschlands (\\"Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany\\"), a critique of Weimar Germany in 1919. This piece combines images from newspapers of the time mixed and re-created to make a new statement about life and art in the Dada movement. From an Ethnographic Museum (1929), one of H√∂ch's most ambitious and highly political projects, is composed of twenty photomontages that depict images of European female bodies with images of African male bodies and masks from museum catalogues, creating collages that offer \\"the visual culture of two vastly separate civilizations as interchangeable‚Äîthe modish European flapper loses none of her stylishness in immediate proximity to African tribal objects; likewise, the non-Western artifact is able to signify in some fundamental sense as ritual object despite its conflation with patently European features.\\" Hoch created Dada Puppens (Dada Dolls) 1916. These dolls were influenced by Hugo Ball, the Zurich-based founder of Dada. The doll's costumes resembled the geometric forms of Ball's own costumes worn in seminal Dada performances.  Important pieces  = Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany (1919) = Dada as a movement was inherently political in nature. Dada artists often used political satires to address the issues of the time. They attempted to push art to the limits of humanity and to convey the chaos in post-war (World War I, which did not yet have this title) Germany. \\"Many of H√∂ch's overtly political photomontages caricatured the pretended socialism of the new republic and linked female liberation with leftist political revolution\\" (Lavin). Perhaps H√∂ch's most well known piece Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Beer-Belly of the Weimar Republic symbolizes her cutting through the patriarchal society. The piece is a direct criticism of the failed attempt at democracy imposed by the Weimar Republic. Cut with the Kitchen Knife is \\"an explosive agglomeration of cut-up images, bang in the middle of the most well-known photograph of the seminal First International Dada Fair in 1920\\" (Hudson). This photomontage is an excellent example of a piece that combines these three central themes in H√∂ch's works: androgyny, the \\"New Woman\\" and political discourse. It combines images of political leaders with sports stars, mechanized images of the city, and Dada artists. = The Beautiful Girl (1920) = \\"The New Woman of Weimar Germany was a sign of modernity and liberation\\" (Lavin). Women in Weimar Germany in theory had a new freedom to discover social, political, and self-definition‚Äîall areas heavily addressed by H√∂ch. Despite this, there were still many issues with the socioeconomic status of women. Women were given more freedom, yet in a way that seemed to be predetermined for them. They were still restricted to certain jobs and had the less employment benefits than their male counterparts. Analysis of H√∂ch's piece Beautiful Woman shows the construction of the archetype of the \\"New Woman\\". The piece combines motifs of the ideal feminine woman with car parts. In the upper right corner there is a woman's face with the eyes of a cat. Along with industrialization comes the opportunity for women to be more involved in the workforce. While this opportunity was exciting for women, it was also frightening‚Äîsymbolized by the cat eyes staring down at the image. This image shows that although women were excited about the idea of the \\"New Woman\\" and the freedom this lifestyle might bring, it was a freedom that was still constructed by men, who still had most of the power in society. = Marlene (1930) = This piece alludes to an ambiguous sexual identity of the subject. The image depicts two men looking upward at a pair of legs clad in stockings with high heels atop a pedestal. This pedestal symbolizes traditionalism, while the legs show sexuality triumphing over classical architecture (which would have been revered by the Nazis). The lips in the upper right corner show a feminine sexuality that is kept from the male gaze. (Lavin). For the viewer, the piece can provide the concept of a utopian moment that opposes gender-hierarchies. \\"Her androgynous images depict a pleasure in the movement between gender positions and a deliberate deconstruction of rigid masculine and feminine identities\\" (Lavin). These ideas were radical at the time when H√∂ch raised them, but are still in the process of being addressed today. Androgyny can be viewed as a utopian ideal in H√∂ch's works; in addition it relates to some of the radical leftist ideas in her works and the political discourse surrounding them. = Ethnographic Museum Series (1924‚Äì1930) = H√∂ch created an expansive series of works titled the Ethnographic Museum Series after a visit to an ethnographic museum. Germany had begun colonial expansion into African and Oceanic territories by the 1880s, which lead to an influx of cultural artifacts into Germany. H√∂ch was inspired by the pedestals and masks present in the museums, and began incorporating them into her art. = Mother (1930) Ethnographic Museum Series (1924‚Äì1930) = This piece is a photomontage, part of H√∂ch's Ethnographic Museum Series, that mainly utilizes the photo of a pregnant, working class mother. H√∂ch effaces the woman with a mask from the Kwakwaka ºwakw, or the Kwakuti Indian tribe, on the Northwest Coast. She pastes a woman's mouth over the bottom of the mask, and a single eye over one of the eye holes. The image is part of an ongoing critique by H√∂ch of Paragraph 218, a law outlawing abortion in Germany at the time. = Death Dance and Time of Suffering Series = H√∂ch also executed two series around 1943, Death Dance and Time of Suffering.Monica Wenke, Aspects of Innere Emigration in Hannah H√∂ch 1933‚Äì1945 (Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 2010), 80‚Äì81. Death Dance consists of three works, titled Death Dance I, Death Dance II, and Death Dance III. This series is primarily watercolor and pencil. The images show individual figures without hair or defining features, in long gray shifts, filing across barren pastel landscapes. The Time of Suffering series is black and white but contains similar figures to the Death Dance series. The series, comprising two works titled Time of Suffering I and Time of Suffering II, shows the figures walking through a cemetery towards a grim reaper, and a line of people leading up into the sky. = Strange Beauty II (1966) = H√∂ch returned to the female figure in the 1960s after a long period where she favored surrealism and abstraction.

It has the reliability of bisection but it can be as quick as some of the less-reliable methods. The algorithm tries to use the potentially fast- converging secant method or inverse quadratic interpolation if possible, but it falls back to the more robust bisection method if necessary. Brent's method is due to Richard Brent and builds on an earlier algorithm by Theodorus Dekker. Consequently, the method is also known as the Brent‚ÄìDekker method. Chandrupatla's method is a variant which is simpler and converges faster for functions that are flat around their roots (which means they have multiple roots or closely located roots).  Dekker's method  The idea to combine the bisection method with the secant method goes back to . Suppose that we want to solve the equation f(x) = 0. As with the bisection method, we need to initialize Dekker's method with two points, say a0 and b0, such that f(a0) and f(b0) have opposite signs. If f is continuous on [a0, b0], the intermediate value theorem guarantees the existence of a solution between a0 and b0. Three points are involved in every iteration: * bk is the current iterate, i.e., the current guess for the root of f. * ak is the \\"contrapoint,\\" i.e., a point such that f(ak) and f(bk) have opposite signs, so the interval [ak, bk] contains the solution. Furthermore, f(bk) should be less than or equal to f(ak), so that bk is a better guess for the unknown solution than ak. * bk‚àí1 is the previous iterate (for the first iteration, we set bk‚àí1 = a0). Two provisional values for the next iterate are computed. The first one is given by linear interpolation, also known as the secant method: :: s = \\\\begin{cases} b_k - \\\\frac{b_k-b_{k-1}}{f(b_k)-f(b_{k-1})} f(b_k), & \\\\mbox{if } f(b_k) eq f(b_{k-1}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ m & \\\\mbox{otherwise } \\\\end{cases} and the second one is given by the bisection method :: m = \\\\frac{a_k+b_k}{2}. If the result of the secant method, s, lies strictly between bk and m, then it becomes the next iterate (bk+1 = s), otherwise the midpoint is used (bk+1 = m). Then, the value of the new contrapoint is chosen such that f(ak+1) and f(bk+1) have opposite signs. If f(ak) and f(bk+1) have opposite signs, then the contrapoint remains the same: ak+1 = ak. Otherwise, f(bk+1) and f(bk) have opposite signs, so the new contrapoint becomes ak+1 = bk. Finally, if f(ak+1) < f(bk+1), then ak+1 is probably a better guess for the solution than bk+1, and hence the values of ak+1 and bk+1 are exchanged. This ends the description of a single iteration of Dekker's method. Dekker's method performs well if the function f is reasonably well-behaved. However, there are circumstances in which every iteration employs the secant method, but the iterates bk converge very slowly (in particular, bk ‚àí bk‚àí1 may be arbitrarily small). Dekker's method requires far more iterations than the bisection method in this case.  Brent's method  proposed a small modification to avoid this problem. He inserted an additional test which must be satisfied before the result of the secant method is accepted as the next iterate. Two inequalities must be simultaneously satisfied: Given a specific numerical tolerance \\\\delta, if the previous step used the bisection method, the inequality :: \\\\delta < b_k - b_{k-1} must hold to perform interpolation, otherwise the bisection method is performed and its result used for the next iteration. If the previous step performed interpolation, then the inequality :: \\\\delta < b_{k-1} - b_{k-2} is used instead to perform the next action (to choose) interpolation (when inequality is true) or bisection method (when inequality is not true). Also, if the previous step used the bisection method, the inequality ::s-b_k < \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac12 \\\\end{matrix} b_k - b_{k-1} must hold, otherwise the bisection method is performed and its result used for the next iteration. If the previous step performed interpolation, then the inequality :: s-b_k < \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac12 \\\\end{matrix} b_{k-1} - b_{k-2} is used instead. This modification ensures that at the kth iteration, a bisection step will be performed in at most 2\\\\log_2(b_{k-1}-b_{k-2}/\\\\delta) additional iterations, because the above conditions force consecutive interpolation step sizes to halve every two iterations, and after at most 2\\\\log_2(b_{k-1}-b_{k-2}/\\\\delta) iterations, the step size will be smaller than \\\\delta, which invokes a bisection step. Brent proved that his method requires at most N2 iterations, where N denotes the number of iterations for the bisection method. If the function f is well-behaved, then Brent's method will usually proceed by either inverse quadratic or linear interpolation, in which case it will converge superlinearly. Furthermore, Brent's method uses inverse quadratic interpolation instead of linear interpolation (as used by the secant method). If f(bk), f(ak) and f(bk‚àí1) are distinct, it slightly increases the efficiency. As a consequence, the condition for accepting s (the value proposed by either linear interpolation or inverse quadratic interpolation) has to be changed: s has to lie between (3ak \\\\+ bk) / 4 and bk. Algorithm input a, b, and (a pointer to) a function for f calculate f(a) calculate f(b) if f(a)f(b) ‚â• 0 then exit function because the root is not bracketed. end if if f(a) < f(b) then swap (a,b) end if c := a set mflag repeat until f(b or s) = 0 or b ‚àí a is small enough (convergence) if f(a) ‚â† f(c) and f(b) ‚â† f(c) then (inverse quadratic interpolation) else (secant method) end if if (condition 1) s is not or (condition 2) (mflag is set and s‚àíb ‚â• b‚àíc/2) or (condition 3) (mflag is cleared and s‚àíb ‚â• c‚àíd/2) or (condition 4) (mflag is set and b‚àíc < ) or (condition 5) (mflag is cleared and c‚àíd < ) then s := \\\\frac{a+b}{2} (bisection method) set mflag else clear mflag end if calculate f(s) d := c (d is assigned for the first time here; it won't be used above on the first iteration because mflag is set) c := b if f(a)f(s) < 0 then b := s else a := s end if if f(a) < f(b) then swap (a,b) end if end repeat output b or s (return the root) Example Suppose that we are seeking a zero of the function defined by f(x) = (x + 3)(x ‚àí 1)2. We take [a0, b0] = [‚àí4, 4/3] as our initial interval. We have f(a0) = ‚àí25 and f(b0) = 0.48148 (all numbers in this section are rounded), so the conditions f(a0) f(b0) < 0 and f(b0) ‚â§ f(a0) are satisfied. Graph of f(x) = (x + 3)(x ‚àí 1)2 # In the first iteration, we use linear interpolation between (b‚àí1, f(b‚àí1)) = (a0, f(a0)) = (‚àí4, ‚àí25) and (b0, f(b0)) = (1.33333, 0.48148), which yields s = 1.23256. This lies between (3a0 \\\\+ b0) / 4 and b0, so this value is accepted. Furthermore, f(1.23256) = 0.22891, so we set a1 = a0 and b1 = s = 1.23256. # In the second iteration, we use inverse quadratic interpolation between (a1, f(a1)) = (‚àí4, ‚àí25) and (b0, f(b0)) = (1.33333, 0.48148) and (b1, f(b1)) = (1.23256, 0.22891). This yields 1.14205, which lies between (3a1 \\\\+ b1) / 4 and b1. Furthermore, the inequality 1.14205 ‚àí b1 ‚â§ b0 ‚àí b‚àí1 / 2 is satisfied, so this value is accepted. Furthermore, f(1.14205) = 0.083582, so we set a2 = a1 and b2 = 1.14205. # In the third iteration, we use inverse quadratic interpolation between (a2, f(a2)) = (‚àí4, ‚àí25) and (b1, f(b1)) = (1.23256, 0.22891) and (b2, f(b2)) = (1.14205, 0.083582). This yields 1.09032, which lies between (3a2 \\\\+ b2) / 4 and b2. But here Brent's additional condition kicks in: the inequality 1.09032 ‚àí b2 ‚â§ b1 ‚àí b0 / 2 is not satisfied, so this value is rejected. Instead, the midpoint m = ‚àí1.42897 of the interval [a2, b2] is computed. We have f(m) = 9.26891, so we set a3 = a2 and b3 = ‚àí1.42897. # In the fourth iteration, we use inverse quadratic interpolation between (a3, f(a3)) = (‚àí4, ‚àí25) and (b2, f(b2)) = (1.14205, 0.083582) and (b3, f(b3)) = (‚àí1.42897, 9.26891). This yields 1.15448, which is not in the interval between (3a3 \\\\+ b3) / 4 and b3). Hence, it is replaced by the midpoint m = ‚àí2.71449. We have f(m) = 3.93934, so we set a4 = a3 and b4 = ‚àí2.71449. # In the fifth iteration, inverse quadratic interpolation yields ‚àí3.45500, which lies in the required interval. However, the previous iteration was a bisection step, so the inequality ‚àí3.45500 ‚àí b4 ‚â§ b4 ‚àí b3 / 2 need to be satisfied. This inequality is false, so we use the midpoint m = ‚àí3.35724. We have f(m) = ‚àí6.78239, so m becomes the new contrapoint (a5 = ‚àí3.35724) and the iterate remains the same (b5 = b4). # In the sixth iteration, we cannot use inverse quadratic interpolation because b5 = b4. Hence, we use linear interpolation between (a5, f(a5)) = (‚àí3.35724, ‚àí6.78239) and (b5, f(b5)) = (‚àí2.71449, 3.93934). The result is s = ‚àí2.95064, which satisfies all the conditions. But since the iterate did not change in the previous step, we reject this result and fall back to bisection. We update s = -3.03587, and f(s) = -0.58418. # In the seventh iteration, we can again use inverse quadratic interpolation. The result is s = ‚àí3.00219, which satisfies all the conditions. Now, f(s) = ‚àí0.03515, so we set a7 = b6 and b7 = ‚àí3.00219 (a7 and b7 are exchanged so that the condition f(b7) ‚â§ f(a7) is satisfied). (Correct : linear interpolation ) # In the eighth iteration, we cannot use inverse quadratic interpolation because a7 = b6. Linear interpolation yields s = ‚àí2.99994, which is accepted. (Correct : ) # In the following iterations, the root x = ‚àí3 is approached rapidly: b9 = ‚àí3 + 6¬∑10‚àí8 and b10 = ‚àí3 ‚àí 3¬∑10‚àí15.

Selected by NASA in 1966 as a member of the fifth astronaut group, he died in an automobile accident before being assigned to a prime or backup spaceflight crew. Early life and education Givens was born on January 5, 1930, in Quanah, Texas. As a child, his family called him Young Galen Givens. He took on extra courses when he was in high school, which allowed him to finish a year early. He worked in a grocery store and spent time cleaning cars to earn money for flying lessons and would hitchhike to Childress Municipal Airport to take them. His parents said he \\"never had an interest in anything but aviation\\". Givens earned his pilot's license in early 1946, and then performed a solo flight the day after he turned 16 in a Piper Cub. He graduated from Quanah High School in 1946. Givens was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He attended Texas A&M; University for a semester and the University of Oklahoma for three semesters. He graduated in 1952, as an outstanding student, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Naval Sciences from the United States Naval Academy. During his time at the academy, Givens (or \\"Give\\", as he was known there), studied academics, undertook flight training, and played varsity lacrosse. Givens and his wife Ada had three children: Catherine H. (born in 1963), Edward G. (born in 1964), and Diane (born in 1967). Military career Charlie Bassett, Greg Neubeck and Mike Collins. Back row: Al Atwell, Neil Garland, Jim Roman, Al Uhalt and Joe Engle. Givens was commissioned in the Air Force as a second lieutenant upon graduating from Annapolis in 1952, and received his flight training as a student pilot at the United States Air Force Air Training Command. On August 18, he flew the T-6 Texan‚Äîthe first advanced trainer he flew with the air force‚Äîand continued to fly the plane almost every day. Givens was awarded his wings on February 4, 1953, as one of the top students. As such, he could choose the branch of the air force where he wanted to serve and chose fighter training at Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, Arizona. The group commander was known to be tough on his students, and Givens chose this location so he could be formed into a great fighter pilot. He started flying the T-28 Trojan at his new assignment, and learned fighter tactics, formation flying, and some aerobatics. Starting on June 3, he flew the two-seater T-33. On October 2, he moved from Chandler to Perrin Air Force Base, in Sherman, Texas, where he continued flying the T-33. In addition to training with the T-33, he began flying the F-86D, an all-weather, single-seat fighter jet with an all-rocket armament, and achieved supersonic speed for the first time while flying it. In 1954, he was promoted to first lieutenant, and was assigned duty in Japan as a flight commander and fighter pilot with the 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group until 1956. He served as an instructor at the Air Force Interceptor Weapons School from January 1956 to March 1958 and then attended the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California as a captain. Graduating as an outstanding graduate (Class 58B), he became an instructor in the Stability and Control Section. His next assignment took him to the Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California, where he was a project pilot with Air Development Squadron 4. While there, he not only conducted operational evaluations, but was responsible for compiling and developing the operation procedures and tactics for fleet operation of the F8U-2N ‚Äì a single-engine, supersonic, carrier-based jet aircraft. He served as Assistant to the Commandant at the USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School from November 1961 to September 1962 and then attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School, from which he graduated in 1963. When informed of his selection for astronaut training in 1966, he was assigned as Project Officer with USAF SSD Detachment 2 at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas. He logged more than 3,500 hours flight time; 2,800 hours in jet aircraft. NASA career Givens (sitting row, 1st from left), with fellow Original 19 astronauts Givens was a Project Mercury finalist in 1959, and was one of nineteen astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966 for its fifth astronaut group. After completing basic astronaut training, he was assigned to the Apollo program, and briefly served on the support crew for the first crewed mission, Apollo 1, and then, after the fire, of Apollo 7. Death On June 6, 1967, Givens was driving his Volkswagen home from a meeting of the Quiet Birdmen fraternal organization, with two other officers, when he missed a sharp, unmarked turn and crashed into a ditch in Pearland, Texas, near the Manned Spacecraft Center. Givens died on the way to the hospital and was survived by his wife Ada and their three children.

The Cathedral, situated on Clayton Street, was designed by Augustus Welby Pugin and built between 1842 and 1844. The cathedral is a grade I listed building and a fine example of the Gothic Revival style of architecture championed by Pugin. There is a monument dedicated to Cardinal Basil Hume in the Monument Garden outside of the cathedral, which was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2002.

By decree of Pope Pius IX on 29 September 1850, the Catholic hierarchy was restored on a regular pattern to England and Wales. Much of what had been known as the Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern District became the new See of Hexham. Bishop William Hogarth was appointed to be the first bishop of the new diocese, and as such, required a church in which to place his seat or cathedra. St Mary's was chosen for this purpose and thus it gained the status of a cathedral church in 1850,\\"175th Anniversary of St Mary's\\", Cathedral Church of St Mary becoming the first cathedral in Newcastle, as the Anglican St. Nicholas' Cathedral didn't become a cathedral until 1882. On 21st August 1860, the Cathedral was dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. The name of the see was changed in 1861 to Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle. Since then, eleven further bishops have been installed in St Mary's as Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle. With a bequest from the estate of Elizabeth Dunn, in 1872 a tower and steeple designed by Dunn & Hansom were added.\\"St Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle\\", Co- Curate Present The seat of the Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle was vacant after the death of the Right Reverend Kevin John Dunn in March 2008. He served in the post for almost four years, having been consecrated a Bishop and installed on the feast of St Bede the Venerable, 25 May 2004. Seamus Cunningham received his episcopal consecration on 20 March 2009 (feast of St. Cuthbert, the diocese's patron), at St. Mary's Cathedral. He is the thirteenth bishop of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle. On 21 April 2006 the incumbent Dean, the Reverend Michael Campion, officially left his appointment at the cathedral. He is succeeded by the Reverend Peter Leighton, formerly the Catholic Chaplain to the University of Durham. Under the careful guidance of the Reverend Peter Leighton, the Cathedral has undergone a thorough period of renovation restoring much of the beauty of the original design. Phase one of the work was completed in September 2010 and phase two of the work, which included the installation of a new three-manual Kenneth Tickell organ of 46 stops, was completed in February 2013.\\"St Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne\\", Kenneth Tickell & Company, Ltd.

It is also described as a scientific field that focuses on the application of concepts, theories, models, or methods of fundamental ecology to environmental problems. Applied ecology is also known as ecological or environmental technology.  Concept  Applied ecology is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management. Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management. Applied ecology includes all disciplines that are related to human activities so that it does not only cover agriculture and forestry but also global change. It has two study categories. The first involves the outputs or those fields that address the use and management of the environment, particularly for its ecosystem services and exploitable resources. The second are the inputs or those that are concerned with the management strategies or human influences on the ecosystem or biodiversity. The discipline is often linked to ecological management on the grounds that the effective management of natural ecosystems depends on ecological knowledge. It often uses an ecological approach to solve problems of specific parts of the environment, which can involve the comparison of plausible options (e.g. best management options). The role of applied science in agricultural production has been brought into greater focus as fluctuations in global food production feed through into prices and availability to consumers  Approaches  Applied ecologists often use one or more of the following approaches, namely, observation, experimentation, and modeling. For example, a wildlife preservation project could involve: observational studies of the wildlife ecology; experiments to understand causal relationships; and the application of modeling to determine the information beyond the scope of experimentation. The ecological approach used in applied ecology could include inputs from management strategies such as conservation biology, restoration ecology, global change, ecotoxicology, biomonitoring, biodiversity, environmental policies, and economics, among others. Restoration ecology is a particularly prominent strategy in the discipline since it applies the principles of restoring and repairing damaged ecological systems to their original state. Like those used in ecological theory, many areas of the discipline employ approaches that are based on simple statistical and analytic models (e.g. spatial models) as well as those with mathematical properties (e.g. matrix models). There is also the digital computer simulation modeling, which is designed to solve statistical ecology problems and to achieve bioeconomic goals such as the forecasting and the evaluation of consequences for specific activities. Applied ecology also requires human interest, particularly the exercise of judgments of relative values and goals.  Applications  Applied ecology can be applied to the economic development process. The discipline, for example, can be integrated into the national economic planning to comprehensively address environmental concerns since these problems are intersectoral and interdisciplinary in nature. Aspects of applied ecology include: Yosemite National Park in the United States. * Agro-ecosystem management * Biodiversity conservation * Biotechnology * Conservation biology *Disturbance management * Ecosystem restoration *Environmental engineering * Habitat management * Invasive species management *Landscape use (including development planning) * Protected areas management * Rangeland management * Restoration ecology *Wildlife management (including game) Major journals in the field include: * Journal of Applied Ecology * Ecological Applications * Applied Ecology and Environmental Research Related organizations include: * Ecological Society of America (The Americas) * Society for Ecological Restoration (Global) * Institute for Applied Ecology (USA) * Kazakh Agency of Applied Ecology * √ñko-Institut (Institute for Applied Ecology) (in Germany) See also *Holistic management *Natural environment *Natural resource *Nature *Environmental impact design *Landscape planning References Skelly, David K, Friedenburg,L.Kealoha, Applied Ecology,DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780199830060-0039 Lubchenco,Jane,Entering the Century of the Environment: A New Social Contract for Science,Science 23 Jan 1998: Vol. 279, Issue 5350, pp. 491‚Äì497 DOI: 10.1126/science.279.5350.491 Caldwell,Lynton K,Problems of Applied Ecology: Perceptions, Institutions, Methods, and Operational Tools BioScience Vol. 16, No. 8 (Aug., 1966), pp. 524‚Äì527 Hobbs,Richard J, Hallett,Lauren M, Ehrlich, Paul R, and Mooney,Harold A,Intervention Ecology: Applying Ecological Science in the Twenty-first Century,BioScience (2011) 61 (6): 442‚Äì450. doi: 10.1525/bio.2011.61.6.6 https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780123948083/encyclopedia-of- applied-plant-sciences Category:Applied sciences Category:Bioremediation Category:Ecology Category:Ecological restoration Category:Environmental design Category:Sustainable urban planning Category:Environmental planning Category:Environmental technology Category:Horticulture and gardening Category:Landscape architecture ","title":"Applied ecology"},{"id":"1254337","text":"Finnish poetry is the poetry from Finland.

Spring of Trivia is the name given by Spike TV to the show , a Japanese comedy game show on Fuji TV. Concept Trivia consists of a series of video segments that introduce and confirm the validity of unusual trivia. Past trivia has included exploding erasers, spiders affected by caffeine, and insects that cannot be killed. Most of the trivia on the show is sent in by viewers. A celebrity panel of five judges (ten in special episodes) evaluate each video segment and votes on how interesting it is by pushing a every time they are astonished. ( is the Japanese interjection for expressing genuine surprise, equivalent to a mix of the English interjections \\"Really?\\" and \\"Wow!\\".) The total of all \\"Hey\\"s collected during the presentation of the trivia (maximum of 20 per judge) is then used as the indicator for the degree of surprise of this trivia. For every \\"Hey\\" a piece of trivia gets, the trivia submitter receives 100 yen. Should it receive a perfect score of 100 Heys (200 in special episodes), the trivia submitter receives 100,000 yen (200,000 in special episodes). To date no piece of trivia has received 100 Heys. At some point in the show, there is a segment called . Viewers submit hypothetical questions intended to produce answers in the form of new trivia; \\"Trivia\\" then \\"go[es] to great lengths to answer them.\\" Tamori (referred to as \\"Chairman Tamori\\" in the English dubbed version) evaluates the Seed of Trivia by pulling a lever. The Seed of Trivia's grade is shown as a flower. is the highest of grades. Past examples of \\"Seed of Trivia\\" segments have included the fastest Japanese baseball mascots, the brand of ramen containing the greatest net noodle length per package, and which form of barbecue lions prefer most. As of 2005, there is a new segment called . This is where they take a trivia sent in by a viewer that turned out to be false and sink it in a sort of bog. Additionally, they say, \\"If you use this trivia, you might be called,\\" and then they always show a cute girl (Tamaki Ogawa) doing some date-like activity and saying, at the end of the segment. At the end of the show, host Norito Yashima gives out , a brain shaped trophy that has a melon bread inside that is in the shape of a brain, to the sender of the highest rated trivia. Co-host Katsumi Takahashi gives out ‚Äì a smaller version of The Golden Brain with the same shape but with no melon bread inside ‚Äì to the sender of his favorite trivia (announced as \\"MFT - My Favorite Trivia\\"). In 2005, small color- appropriate banners were added to the awards, and in 2006, the awards began featuring a small analog clock. History Trivia has been running in Japan since October 7, 2002, first as a low-budget program after midnight (with initially much more obscene and sexual trivia than afterwards). Its increasing cult status (the show obtained viewership ratings just above 5%) made Fuji TV shift the broadcast time to prime time July 2, 2003. On November 4, 2004 Fuji TV announced that twenty six episodes of Trivia would be adapted for broadcast in the United States on the cable network Spike TV (now Paramount Network). The network began airing the slightly edited English dubbed version of the show on November 11, with the broadcast ending in May 2005. The editing included the removal of certain culturally specific trivia pieces such as those referring to Japanese history and actors. The shorter run time was made up for by adding trivia pieces from other episodes. Unlike Spike TV's other Japanese show MXC, the English dialogue was mostly based on the original Japanese utterances and texts, although it was often exaggerated in a comical manner. Spike had planned to produce an American version of the show premiering in Spring 2005, but that version never materialized and the network decided against ordering more episodes of the English dub.

This put an end to the Chilean Patria Vieja and it was the decisive step of the Spanish military Reconquest of Chile. Background When Spain heard about the Patriot revolt in Chile, they sent an army of Spanish soldiers and royalists to defeat the rebellion. When O'Higgins heard about the besieged army in Rancagua, he went with his army of 1,000 patriots, to reinforce Juan Carrera's army in Rancagua. Outnumbered and with barely enough supplies, O'Higgins did not retreat and sealed the fate of his army. The Battle The battle occurred on the morning of October 1, 1814, outside the town of Rancagua. The Chilean forces had occupied the town prior to this confrontation and ultimately were surrounded by Osorio‚Äôs forces who advanced towards the town. The reason for occupying the town was its strategic importance in the defense of the Chilean capital, Santiago. The battle was fierce and the Spanish had an elite force of soldiers known as ‚ÄúTalaveras‚Äù who were veterans from the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. As the fighting continued onward to the evening, the Spanish forces decided to set fire to the town. With casualties growing, the Chilean forces requested reinforcements from the capital city of Santiago, which was 87 Kilometers north of Rancagua. Ultimately the request failed, which forced the Chilean army to disperse and flee to the countryside and wilderness. After this victory, the Spanish army continued on to Santiago, crushed the Chilean Government and instituted their brutal Reconquista of Chile. Aftermath After the Battle of Rancagua, the Spanish captured Santiago within a few days, which marked the beginning of the Reconquista of South America. This battle became a stain on Chile's national memory as it was a time when the nation was lost and the people feared that their struggle for independence was in vain. The people fled elsewhere in South America as refugees to escape the violence the Spanish would have meted out to the rebels.

H. Breen, American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People (Macmillan, 2010), pp. 162, 186‚Äì89. In Massachusetts, as affairs drew toward a crisis, it became usual for towns to appoint three committees: of correspondence, of inspection, and of safety. The first was to keep the community informed of dangers either legislative or executive, and concert measures of public good; the second to watch for violations of non-importation agreements, or attempts of loyalists to evade them; the third to act as general executive while the legal authority was in abeyance. In February 1776 these were regularly legalized by the Massachusetts General Court but consolidated into one called the \\"Committee of Correspondence, Inspection, and Safety\\" to be elected annually by the towns. Committees of correspondence Committees of correspondence were public functionaries of a type first appearing in England, created by the parliamentary party of the 17th century in their struggles with the Stuarts. In 1763, when the English government attempted to enforce the trade and navigation acts on the American colonies after the Peace of Paris, the colonial leaders advised the merchants to hold meetings and appoint committees to memorialize the legislature and correspond with each other to forward a union of interests. This was done in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York 1763‚Äì4. On 21 November 1772 a town meeting at Faneuil Hall, Boston, appointed a correspondence committee of 21 to communicate with other Massachusetts towns concerning infringements of popular rights. Until late in 1774 (see Committees of Safety) it remained the real executive of the town and largely of the province. The Boston committee, by legal town-meeting, was made the executive of Boston. Under its direction the tea was thrown into the harbor, and the Tea Act of 1773 roused the remaining colonies: Georgia in September, Maryland and Delaware in October, North Carolina in December, New York and New Jersey in February, chose legislative committees of correspondence; and new municipalities joined the movement ‚Äî several in New Hampshire and Rhode Island and the city of New York. After the Boston Port Bill came into effect the Boston committee invited those of eight other towns to meet in Faneuil Hall, and the meeting sent circulars to the other colonies recommending suspension of trade with Great Britain, while the legislative committee was directed by the House to send copies of the Port Bill to other colonies, and call attention to it as an attempt to suppress American liberty. The organization of the committees was at once enormously extended; almost every town, city, or county had one. In the middle and southern colonies the committees were empowered, by the terms of their appointment, to elect deputies to meet with those of other committees, to consult on measures for the public good. Committees of inspection (committees of observation) Pursuant to First Continental Congress resolution 11, committees of inspection were to be formed in every county, city and town to enforce the Continental Association. Hundreds of committees of inspection were formed following the First Continental Congress's declaration of the Continental Association, a boycott of British goods, in October 1774.Kathleen Burk, Old World, New World: Great Britain and America from the Beginning (Grove, 2007), pp. 144‚Äì45. In New York City, it was called the Committee of Observation or Committee of Sixty. Initially, the focus of the committees was on enforcing the Non-importation Agreements, which aimed to hinder the import of British manufactured goods. However, as the revolutionary crisis continued, the committees rapidly took on greater powers, filling the vacuum left by the colonial governments; the committees began to collect taxes and recruit soldiers. Kathleen Burk writes: \\"It is significant that the Committees believed that they derived their authority from the Continental Congress, not from the provincial assemblies or congresses.\\" Committees of safety Committees of Safety were a later outcome of the committees of correspondence. Committees of safety were executive bodies that governed during adjournments of, were created by, and derived their authority from, provincial assemblies or congresses, like those of the New York Provincial Congress.The Committees of safety were an emergency \\"panel\\" of leading citizens, who pass laws, hand down regulations, enact statutes, and did other fundamental business prior to the declaration of independence in July 1776 and the passage of individual state constitutions. As they assumed power to govern, however, they generally chose to observe rough legal procedures, warning and shaming enemies rather than killing them. Two examples of the rough legal proceedings were forced public confessions and apologies for slander or more violently, roughing up an individual for voting against giving the poor Bostonian's supplies. Many of the men that served on their individual states Committees of safety were later delegates for the continental congress. Importance T. H. Breen writes that \\"proliferation of local committees represented a development of paramount importance in the achievement of independence,\\" because the committees were the first step in the creation of \\"a formal structure capable not only of policing the revolution on the ground but also of solidifying ties with other communities.\\" The network of committees were also vital for reinforcing \\"a shared sense of purpose,\\" speaking to \\"an imagined collectivity‚Äîa country of the mind\\" of Americans. The strengthening of the committees of correspondence in the 1770s also marked the creation of what Gordon S. Wood terms \\"a new kind of popular politics in America.\\"Gordon S. Wood, The American Revolution: A History (Random House, 2002). Wood writes that \\"the rhetoric of liberty now brought to the surface long-latent political tendencies. Ordinary people were no longer willing to trust only wealthy and learned gentlemen to represent them ... various artisan, religious, and ethnic groups now felt that their particular interests were so distinct that only people of their kind could speak for them. In 1774 radicals in Philadelphia demanded that seven artisans and six Germans be added to the revolutionary committee of the city.\\" The development of coalition and interest-group politics greatly alarmed both royal officials and more conservative Patriots. For example, William Henry Drayton, the prominent South Carolina planter who had studied at Oxford University, complained about the participation of cobblers and butchers, stating that \\"Nature never intended that such men should be profound politicians, or able statesmen. In 1775, the royal governor of Georgia \\"noted in astonishment that the committee in control of Savannah consisted of 'a Parcel of the Lowest People, chiefly carpenters, shoemakers, Blacksmiths etc with a Jew at their head.\\"The reference to \\"a Jew at their head\\" is to Mordecai Sheftall. Very few records of committees of safety survive. Committee activities are attested primarily through newspapers and published material. By 1775, the committees had become counter-governments that gradually replaced royal authority and took control of local governments. They regulated the economy, politics, morality, and militia of their individual communities. In North Carolina in December 1776, they came under the control of a more powerful central authority, the Council of Safety.Alan D.

It is located in the county of Middlesex, and is one of the island's largest and most economically valued parishes because of its many resources. It includes the first capital of Jamaica, Spanish Town, originally known as San Jago de la Vega or Santiago de la Vega (St. James of the Plain). History St. Catherine was formed in 1867 Geography and People St Catherine Parish Council offices St Catherine is located at . It is bordered by St Andrew in the east, Clarendon in the west, and by St Mary and St Ann in the north. It has an area of 1,192 km¬≤, making it one of Jamaica's largest parishes and it is one of the fastest growing parishes in the nation and has the largest economy out of all fourteen parishes. Except for the Hellshire Hills near the coast, the south of the parish is virtually flat. The central and northern sections are very mountainous, however; the northern border is on Mount Rosser, which crosses over into St Ann, the highest point being . A plain of approximately occupies the southern part of the Rio Cobre basin. The Rio Cobre is the only river that runs along the southern plain. It provides water to irrigate over on the plain. Commerce =Development= Out of all the parishes (with the exception of Kingston Parish and Saint Andrew Parish) Saint Catherine shows the most potential for urban development. With its good water resources, virtually flat landscape, and nearness to the capital, it could possibly be one of the Caribbean's major urban areas in the next few years. =Agriculture= Agriculture remains the main source of employment in the parish. There are many small farmers who practice mixed farming; crops such as bananas, coconuts, pineapple, citrus, pumpkins, peppers, coffee and callaloo are planted for both domestic and commercial purposes. The larger properties produce sugar cane, bananas and citrus mainly for export. Dairy farms are also found in the parish. One of these is a farm in Old Harbour. The Salt Ponds District between Spanish Town, Port Henderson and Passage Fort is noted for the fine fish especially calipera. =Manufacturing= St Catherine is second only to Kingston as an industrial center. Industrial plants are some of the biggest employers in the parish. Spanish Town has the largest salt producing plant in the Caribbean, while Jamaica Milk Products, an affiliate of the Nestl√© organization, has a factory in Bog Walk, another major town in the parish. The largest power plant in the island and several factories are located in Old Harbour. Twickenham Park, near Spanish Town, is another industrial estate with mainly light industries including cigarettes, carpets, batteries, plastic items, medical and pharmaceutical products. =Tourist sites= *Jamaica's emancipation Square can be found in Spanish Town. This is the only Georgian square in Jamaica. Kings House and the House of Assembly on the west and east sides, respectively, were erected in 1762. The Courthouse was built in 1819 and used as a chapel and armory with the Town Hall upstairs. *The Rio Cobre River and Gorge is one of the largest in the island. Sinking at a place called River Sink at Worthy Park, it runs underground for nearly six kilometres, then surfaces at River Head Grand Cave in St Thomas-in-the-Vale. Before entering the gorge it is joined by a number of tributaries, such as the Thomas River, the Rio D'Oro and the Rio Pedro. In the early 1770s, a road was opened through the gorge. The Flat Bridge was originally constructed of logs, which were washed away in a flood. The present bridge was built and it has withstood countless floods. A marker can be found, which shows where the water rose to over above the bridge in 1933. An apocryphal story is that at noon, on every Good Friday, for a short period of time the ghosts of all the slaves who drowned in the river can be seen. *Caymanas Race Track, Jamaica's most famous race track, is in St Catherine. *St Clair Cave, one of Jamaica's more famous caves, is found in the parish. This large, complex cave contains one of the most notable bat roosts on the island, and is one of the few known historical sites for the possibly extinct bat, Phyllonycteris aphylla. Because of the biological importance of the system, and the inherent dangers involved in exploring it (i.e. noxious gases, histoplasmosis, Cutaneous larva migrans, difficult footing), casual visitation is discouraged.

The location of the freeport was the old buccaneer stronghold of Tortuga island located some 10 miles off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola, which is also shared by the Dominican Republic. Freeport Tortuga ended with its expropriation by the Haitian government in 1974. Origin of the freeport In 1967, during the time that Don Pierson of Eastland, Texas was attempting to lease a radio broadcasting ship that had been the former homes of Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio off the coast of England, he received a response from the Ambassador for Haiti in Washington, DC. Don Pierson's original plan was to lease or sell the ship to the government of Haiti for it to establish two powerful 50 kW commercial radio stations. Dupont Caribbean Inc. This offer emerged into a plan to develop the island of Tortuga as a freeport and he was asked to assist the government of Haiti to encourage business investment in that poverty- stricken land. This privately financed, privately managed free enterprise zone became a reality in 1971 when Haitian dictator Fran√ßois Duvalier (known as \\"Papa Doc\\") and the Haitian government entered into a 99-year contract with Don Pierson's company called Dupont Caribbean Inc. This contract provided for the establishment of Freeport Tortuga. Construction Within 18 months Don Pierson succeeded in building the island's first airport, a loading dock for seagoing vessels, a rudimentary water and sewer system, an electricity generating facility, and six miles of paved road. Of equal importance, the project created jobs for some 400 previously unemployed Haitians and resulted in the establishment of a small school to teach various job skills. During this period he also became Honorary Consul of the Republic of Haiti to Texas from 1969 through 1974. Expropriation The project came to abrupt end in 1974 when, after it was announced that Gulf Oil Corporation was contemplating investing more than $300 million to build a resort on the island, the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as \\"Baby Doc\\"), summarily expropriated the project, resulting in its collapse.

History The building was designed in 1862 by the Edinburgh architects John Dick Peddie and Charles Kinnear, opening in 1866 as the Morgan Hospital, a charitable institution providing accommodation and education for \\"sons of tradesmen and persons of the working class generally whose parents stand in the need of assistance\\". In 1888, Morgan Hospital closed and a year later in 1889, the school opened as Morgan Academy, often referred to by alumni as simply \\"The Morgan\\". The building is similar in design to Fettes College in Edinburgh. The architecture is designated as a Category 'A' listing by Historic Scotland. Morgan Academy Dundee Central Tower Detail Its benefactor was John Morgan, the son of a Dundee maltman, who emigrated to India at the age of 20 where, with his brother, he became a wealthy indigo farmer. Upon his death in 1850 he bequeathed much of his fortune to establish a residential institution. The hospital closed in 1888 and was bought by the members of the Dundee Burgh School Board, who re-opened it as a school. =Grammar school= Until the advent of comprehensive education in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were mainly two types of high school in Scotland: junior secondaries where students left school at 16 and began preparation for one of the trades or entered the workforce, and academies where students remained until the end of fifth or sixth year and took highers before normally going to college or university. Morgan functioned in the latter category. Morgan Academy Dundee Wall Detail =Comprehensive= Morgan Academy became a comprehensive school in 1972, although the school was still called an academy rather than a high school. =Fire= The school suffered a fire on 21 March 2001 which destroyed much of the building. It was rebuilt using the original facade and much of the internal appearance and re-opened in August 2004. Morgan Academy In Dundee  Present day  A portrait of John Morgan, found in the basement of the McManus Galleries, was unveiled at newly rebuilt school and placed on show in the Great Hall of the school.

Background Hastings has degrees from the University of Western Ontario (1963) and the University of Toronto (1967). He worked as a political researcher, and as a teacher in Ontario's Secondary School system. In 1975, he worked as executive assistant to provincial cabinet minister Lorne Henderson. Hastings was a member of the Worker's Compensation Board from 1977 to 1994, and also served on the Advisory Board of the Institute of Study of Antisocial behaviour in Youth before entering public life. Politics Hastings ran for the City of Toronto's Hydro Commission in 1985, and was elected on the second position. He was elected to the Etobicoke City Council in 1988, and held this position until 1995. Hastings was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating long-serving New Democrat Ed Philip by fewer than 1,000 votes in Etobicoke‚ÄîRexdale. IN April 1997 he was appointed as a Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Transportation. In the 1999 provincial election, Hastings ran for re-election in the redistributed riding of Etobicoke North, and retained his seat with less than 40% of the popular vote. Hastings's riding was targeted by both the Liberals and NDP, and many believe that \\"vote-splitting\\" among the opposition parties caused his re-election. In 2000, Hastings supported Stockwell Day for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance on the second ballot of the newly formed party's leadership contest (Regina Leader Post, 28 June 2000). He supported Ernie Eves to replace Harris as party leader in 2002, even though his riding executive endorsed rival candidate Jim Flaherty. Hastings rarely spoke in the legislature after Harris's retirement as premier, and did not seek re-election in 2003. On November 13, 2006, Hastings was elected to the Toronto District School Board as Trustee for Ward 1 (Etobicoke North), defeating incumbent Stan Nemiroff. Hastings took office in December 2006. He was re-elected in 2010 but was defeated in 2014 by Michael Ford who was fifty- two years his junior, the nephew of then-Mayor Rob Ford and then-councillor Doug Ford. After 17 months, Michael Ford vacated his school board seat to run for the municipal council seat held by Rob Ford at his death.

It is located at an altitude of above sea level in the district of Ollantaytambo, province of Urubamba, Cusco region. During the Inca Empire, Ollantaytambo was the royal estate of Emperor Pachacuti, who conquered the region,de Gamboa, P.S., 2015, History of the Incas, Lexington, and built the town and a ceremonial center. At the time of the Spanish conquest of Peru, it served as a stronghold for Manco Inca Yupanqui, leader of the Inca resistance. Nowadays, located in what is called the Sacred Valley of the Incas, it is an important tourist attraction on account of its Inca ruins and its location en route to one of the most common starting points for the four-day, three-night hike known as the Inca Trail.  History  Viracocha's or Tunupa's image in stone on the mountain Pinkuylluna overlooks Ollantaytambo: Viracocha was the creator god of pre-Incan and Incan mythology.Fernando E. Elorrieta Salazar & Edgar Elorrieta Salazar ‚Äì Cusco and the Sacred Valley of the Incas (2005), pages 83‚Äì91 Around the mid-15th century, the Inca emperor Pachacuti conquered and razed Ollantaytambo; the town and the nearby region were incorporated into his personal estate.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 19. The emperor rebuilt the town with sumptuous constructions and undertook extensive works of terracing and irrigation in the Urubamba Valley; the town provided lodging for the Inca nobility, while the terraces were farmed by yanakuna, retainers of the emperor.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 64. After Pachacuti's death, the estate came under the administration of his panaqa, his family clan.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 27. During the Spanish conquest of Peru, Ollantaytambo served as a temporary capital for Manco Inca, leader of the native resistance against the conquistadors. He fortified the town and its approaches in the direction of the former Inca capital of Cusco, which had fallen under Spanish domination.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 26. In 1536, on the plain of Mascabamba, near Ollantaytambo, Manco Inca defeated a Spanish expedition, blocking their advance from a set of high terraces and flooding the plain.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 23.Leon, P., 1998, The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter, edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, Despite his victory, however, Manco Inca did not consider his position tenable, so the following year, he withdrew to the heavily forested site of Vilcabamba,Hemming, The conquest, pp. 222‚Äì223. where he established the Neo-Inca State. In 1540, the native population of Ollantaytambo was assigned in encomienda to Hernando Pizarro.Glave and Remy, Estructura agraria, p. 6. In the 19th century, the Inca ruins at Ollantaytambo attracted the attention of several foreign explorers; among them, Clements Markham, Ephraim Squier, Charles Wiener, and Ernst Middendorf published accounts of their findings.Hemming, The conquest, pp. 559. Hiram Bingham III stopped here in 1911 on his journey up the Urubamba River in search of Machu Picchu.  Description  The town of Ollantaytambo is located along the Patakancha River, close to the point where it joins the Willkanuta River. The main settlement is located on the left margin of the Patakancha with a smaller compound called 'Araqhama on the right margin. The main Inca ceremonial center is located beyond 'Araqhama on a hill called Cerro Bandolista. Several Inca structures are in the surrounding areas, and what follows is a brief description of the main sites. = Town = 'Araqhama and the plaza of Manyaraki The main settlement at Ollantaytambo has an orthogonal layout with four longitudinal streets crossed by seven parallel streets.Protzen, Inca Architecture, p. 50. At the center of this grid, the Incas built a large plaza that may have been up to four blocks large; it was open to the east and surrounded by halls and other town blocks on its other three sides.Protzen, Inca Architecture, stones.Protzen, Inca Architecture, p. 52. All blocks on the southern half of the town were built to the same design; each comprised two kancha, walled compounds with four one-room buildings around a central courtyard.Protzen, Inca Architecture, p. 53. Buildings in the northern half are more varied in design; however, most are in such a bad condition that their original plan is hard to establish.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 65. A typical Inca doorway still used in the town: The single stone lintel is a sign of importance. Ollantaytambo dates from the late 15th century and has some of the oldest continuously occupied dwellings in South America.Kubler, The Art and Architecture, pp. 462‚Äì463. Its layout and buildings have been altered to different degrees by later constructions; for instance, on the southern edge of the town, an Inca esplanade with the original entrance to the town was rebuilt as a Plaza de Armas surrounded by colonial and republican buildings.Protzen, Inca Architecture, pp. 48‚Äì49. The plaza at the center of the town also disappeared, as several buildings were built over it in colonial times.Gasparini and Margolies, Inca Architecture, p. 71. 'Araqhama is a western prolongation of the main settlement, across the Patakancha River; it features a large plaza, called Manyaraki, surrounded by constructions made out of adobe and semicut stones. These buildings have a much larger area than their counterparts in the main settlement; they also have very tall walls and oversized doors. To the south are other structures, but smaller and built out of fieldstones. Araqhama has been continuously occupied since Inca times, as evidenced by the Roman Catholic church on the eastern side of the plaza.Protzen, Inca Architecture, pp. 66‚Äì70. To the north of Manyaraki are several sanctuaries with carved stones, sculpted rock faces, and elaborate waterworks; they include the Templo de Agua and the Ba√±o de la √ëusta.Protzen, Inca Architecture, p. 28. = Temple Hill = Wall of the Six Monoliths 'Araqhama is bordered to the west by Cerro Bandolista, a steep hill on which the Incas built a ceremonial center. The part of the hill facing the town is occupied by the terraces of Pumatallis, framed on both flanks by rock outcrops. Due to impressive character of these terraces, the Temple Hill is commonly known as the Fortress, but this is a misnomer, as the main functions of this site were religious. The main access to the ceremonial center is a series of stairways that climb to the top of the terrace complex. At this point, the site is divided into three main areas: the Middle sector, directly in front of the terraces; the Temple sector, to the south; and the Funerary sector, to the north.Protzen, Inca Architecture, pp. 73‚Äì74. The Temple sector is built out of cut and fitted stones in contrast to the other two sectors of the Temple Hill, which are made out of fieldstones. It is accessed by a stairway that ends on a terrace with a half-finished gate and the Enclosure of the Ten Niches, a one-room building. Behind them is an open space which hosts the Platform of the Carved Seat and two unfinished monumental walls. The main structure of the whole sector is the Sun Temple, an uncompleted building which features the Wall of the Six Monoliths.Protzen, Inca Architecture, pp. 81‚Äì87. The Middle and Funerary sectors have several rectangular buildings, some of them with two floors; also, several fountains are in the Middle sector.Protzen, Inca Architecture, pp. 87‚Äì91. \\"The bath of the princess\\", a fountain at the base of the ruins The unfinished structures at the Temple Hill and the numerous stone blocks that litter the site indicate that it was still undergoing construction at the time of its abandonment. Some of the blocks show evidence of having been removed from finished walls, which provides evidence that a major remodeling effort was also underway.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 92‚Äì94. Which event halted construction at the Temple Hill is unknown; likely candidates include the war of succession between Hu√°scar and Atahualpa, the Spanish Conquest of Peru, and the retreat of Manco Inca from Ollantaytambo to Vilcabamba,Protzen, Inca Architecture, p. 269.. However it is also theorised that they are the work of a much older pre-incan culture Hatcher-Childress, Ancient Technology in Peru & Bolivia, = Terraces = Terraces of Pumatallis The valleys of the Urubamba and Patakancha Rivers along Ollantaytambo are covered by an extensive set of agricultural terraces or andenes which start at the bottom of the valleys and climb up the surrounding hills. The andenes permitted farming on otherwise unusable terrain; they also allowed the Incas to take advantage of the different ecological zones created by variations in altitude.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 30‚Äì34. Terraces at Ollantaytambo were built to a higher standard than common Inca agricultural terraces; for instance, they have higher walls made of cut stones instead of rough fieldstones. This type of high-prestige terracing is also found in other Inca royal estates such as Chinchero, Pisaq, and Yucay.Hyslop, Inka settlement, pp. 282‚Äì284. A set of sunken terraces starts south of Ollantaytambo's Plaza de Armas, stretching all the way to the Urubamba River. They are about 700 m long, 60 m wide, and up to 15 m below the level of surrounding terraces; due to their shape, they are called Callej√≥n, the Spanish word for alley. Land inside Callej√≥n is protected from the wind by lateral walls which also absorb solar radiation during the day and release it during the night; this creates a microclimate zone 2 to 3 ¬∞C warmer than the ground above it. These conditions allowed the Incas to grow species of plants native to lower altitudes that otherwise could not have flourished at this site.Protzen, Inca architecture, p. 97. At the southern end of Callej√≥n, overlooking the Urubamba River, is an Inca site called Q'ellu Raqay. Its interconnected buildings and plazas form an unusual design quite unlike the single-room structures common in Inca architecture. As the site is isolated from the rest of Ollantaytambo and surrounded by an elaborate terraces, it was postulated to be a palace built for emperor Pachacuti.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 102‚Äì110. = Storehouses = Pinkuylluna, Inca storehouses near Ollantaytambo The Incas built several storehouses or qullqas () out of fieldstones on the hills surrounding Ollantaytambo. Their location at high altitudes, where more wind and lower temperatures occur, defended their contents against decay. To enhance this effect, the Ollantaytambo qullqas feature ventilation systems. They are thought to have been used to store the production of the agricultural terraces built around the site.Protzen, Inca Architecture, pp. 111‚Äì135. Grain would be poured in the windows on the uphill side of each building, then emptied out through the downhill side window.Robert Randall, referenced by Peter Frost, p148 \\"Exploring Cusco\\", 1999. = Quarries = The main quarries of Ollantaytambo were located at Kachiqhata, in a ravine across the Urubamba River some 5 km from the town. The site features three main quarrying areas: Mullup'urku, Kantirayoq, and Sirkusirkuyoq; all of them provided blocks of rose rhyolite for the elaborate buildings of the Temple Hill. An elaborate network of roads, ramps, and slides connected them with the main building areas. In the quarries are several chullpas, small stone towers used as burial sites in pre-Hispanic times.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 137‚Äì153. = Defenses = As Ollantaytambo is surrounded by mountains, and the main access routes run along the Urubamba Valley; there, the Incas built roads connecting the site with Machu Picchu to the west and Pisaq to the east. During the Spanish conquest of Peru, emperor Manco Inca fortified the eastern approaches to fend off Spanish attacks from Cusco during the Battle of Ollantaytambo. The first line of defense was a steep bank of terraces at Pachar, near the confluence of the Anta and Urubamba Rivers. Behind it, the Incas channeled the Urubamba to make it cross the valley from right to left and back, thus forming two more lines, which were backed by the fortifications of Choqana on the left bank and 'Inkapintay on the right bank. Past them, at the plain of Mascabamba, 11 high terraces closed the valley between the mountains and a deep canyon formed by the Urubamba. The only way to continue was through the gate of T'iyupunku, a thick defensive wall with two narrow doorways. To the west of Ollantaytambo, the small fort of Choquequillca defended the road to Machu Picchu. In the event of these fortifications being overrun, the Temple Hill itself with its high terraces provided a last line of defense against invaders.Protzen, Inca architecture, pp. 22‚Äì26.

The battle was fought on September 14, 1180, in the southwest of present-day Odawara, Kanagawa Prefecture, near Yoritomo's headquarters at Kamakura. Background Yoritomo was exiled by Taira no Kiyomori following the Heiji Rebellion of 1160. In the following years, the Taira clan attempted to consolidate their position, eventually forcing the Emperor Takakura to abdicate in favour of his infant son, Antoku, whose mother was a Taira. Prince Mochihito felt that the throne should have been his, and in May 1180, issued an appeal to the Minamoto clan to rise against the Taira. When Kiyomori heard that Yoritomo had left Izu Province for the Hakone Pass, he appointed ≈åba Kagechika to stop him. Although there was much sympathy for Yoritomo's call to arms, the clans were wary of openly supporting him and an army of only 300 gathered at Ishibashiyama where he had raised his standard. A force from the Miura clan was prevented from reaching Yoritomo by the Sakawa River which was in flood. The battle Kiyomori launched a night attack on the Minamato camp with 3,000 men. A further 300 under It≈ç Sukechika skirted around the camp and attacked from the rear. The defenders were aided by elements of Kiyomori's force who were secretly loyal to the Minamato and who could disrupt the battle without detection in the dark and stormy conditions. However, sheer weight of numbers soon told and the Minamato made a fighting retreat, culminating in a final stand by a hollow tree. When all was lost, Yoritomo is said to have hidden inside the tree trunk with a single companion. Here he was found by one of his secret allies and smuggled from the battlefield.De Benneville, pp. 29-30 Yoritomo fled by sea from Cape Manazuru to Awa Province in the south of present-day Chiba Prefecture on September 28, 1180.

History =3C= It was published in 1959 by members of the Radio Astronomy Group of the University of Cambridge. References to entries in this catalogue in the scientific literature use the prefix 3C followed by the entry number, with a space, e.g. 3C 273. The catalogue was produced using the Cambridge Interferometer on the west side of Cambridge. (The interferometer had previously been used for the 2C survey, published in 1955.) =3CR= The catalogue was subsequently revised by Bennett in 1962 using observations at 178 MHz, and for many years '3CR' was considered as the definitive listing of the brighter radio sources in the Northern Hemisphere. The revision resulted in a number of sources being deleted from the catalogue (as being below the flux limit of 9 Jy or as now- resolved blends of adjacent sources) and others being added. To avoid renumbering the existing sources (which were listed in RA order) these new sources were added using a decimal extension. E.g. 3C 323.1 follows 3C 323 in Right Ascension and precedes 3C 324. =3CRR= A further revision by Laing, Riley and Longair in 1983, called 3CRR or 3CR¬≤, included galaxies which were not detected in the original catalogue due to shortcomings of the original observations, but which otherwise meet the flux and declination limits. This new catalogue, which includes all extragalactic radio sources on the Northern Hemisphere with 178-MHz flux density > 10.9 Jy (on the scale of Baars et al.), declination greater than 10 degrees, and Galactic latitude greater than 10 degrees or less than -10 degrees, is formally a complete sample of radio galaxies and radio loud quasars. It excludes a number of well-known 3C/3CR objects, including, of course, all the supernova remnants from 3C, but also some well-known radio galaxies that fall foul of the declination, flux density or galactic latitude constraints. Objects that had been discovered to consist of multiple components associated with different objects were given an alphabetical suffix (A, B...) to make it clear which component was part of the sample: e.g. the radio galaxy 3C 66B is part of the sample, but the BL Lac object 3C 66A is not.

The group formed in 1992, following a series of live \\"jams\\" instigated by DJ Dave Carnovale (Crucial D) in collaboration with Damian Robinson and other DJs Scott Pullen and Mark Walton which took place at the Bentley Bar c. 1991 in Sydney's Darlinghurst area. They have released five albums to date. Originally featuring reggae and hip hop, the group expanded their sound to incorporate elements of soul, jazz, Latin, funk and breaks. They have been nominated for three ARIA Music Awards and an Australian Dance Music Award as well as creating dozens of remixes for others. The lineup of the group was originally Linda Janssen and MC KYE on vocals, alongside producers Damian Robinson and DJ Dave Carnovale. Over the years many other artists have been included in the lineup of the 'Live' band including Marko Simec (Waiting For Guinness), the late Bruce (Babs) Clarke, well known breaks producer Andy Page, Dave Norris (Nubreed) as well as current performers Gerard Masters, Ian Mussington and Cameron Undy. Dave Carnovale departed the band in 2003 to concentrate on his 'Dubnosis' project and MC Kye departed the band shortly after the release of their fourth album 4ormation in 2005 to work on his Budspells Album. They have headlined their own tours and have supported Ben Harper and The Fugees Releases The first single releases, Stand Up, Inside and Summer Sun were produced by John Prior at Unity Gain Studios. Stand Up was the group's first video, Inside and Summer Sun were originally released on Matt Hayward's independent label One Movement, while Summer Sun was picked up by DJ Andy Glitre and continued to receive high rotation on national radio network Triple J for several years. The first album release, Music From The Core was also originally released on One Movement in 1996 and the single \\"Local MP\\" also achieved high radio rotation. These tracks were featured on the soundtrack to the French film Clubbed to Death (Lola). They collaborated with other local artists such as Yothu Yindi, Directions in Groove, Deborah Conway, Iva Davies, Christine Anu and Renee Geyer. The second album, Inna Styles was released through Mushroom in 2000, followed by an extensive touring schedule. Three singles from the album I Don‚Äôt Wanna know, Church of Al Green, and Stay With Me Til Dawn were again featured on Triple J. The album also featured dancefloor tracks Cookin‚Äô with Kazz and Genie of the Lab. In 2000 Wicked Beat Sound System received an ARIA nomination for Inna Styles and a Dance Music Award nomination (DMA) for Best Band. They also played festivals across Australia including the Perth International Arts Festival, Vibes On A Summer's Day and the closing of the Sydney Paralympics. In 2002 the third album, New Soul Breaks was released and featured vocal tracks by Janssen including I Want To and Brand New Day, as well as instrumental tracks Do The Tings and Ounce Of Swing. In the same year they received another ARIA nomination for Best Dance Release. In 2005 Wicked Beat Sound System released 4ormation featuring the track Nightmare. Shortly after the release of 4ormation MC Kye departed the group to concentrate on his solo project and the group ceased touring for a period of time. In 2006, Wicked Beat Sound System, now largely Robinson and Janssen, recorded Hydromajestik which was released on 24 March 2007. More in the vein of their previous Inna Styles album this album featured vocal tracks in addition to dub-influenced instrumentals, the first single was Won‚Äôt Let Go. In 2008 WBSS released Dreaming album . The Dreaming album was originally a commissioned piece of work written by Damian Robinson. He was approached by Indigenous Artistic director Rhoda Roberts to compose the music for a Cleansing Ceremony she was directing called Sydney Dreaming which was to be a theatrical adaptation of the rainmaker creation story. Since that performance, variations of this music have been performed at several Festivals and Ceremonies including Woodford Festival and Perths International Arts festival. The Dreaming album is the culmination of several years work. The original concept was penned in the heat of a Byron Bay summer and completed in WBs studio in Sydney and then Bungendore. The themes revolve around Salt Water, Fresh Water and Desert, three dividing realities for aboriginal connection to country. The Dreaming Cd was nominated for Aria award in 2009 in the category of \\"Best World Music Release\\". Reworked variations from this Album were used to make the soundtrack for the Lighting Of The Sydney Opera House Sails for Vivid Festival 2016 along with Badu Gili (meaning ‚Äòwater light‚Äô in the language of the traditional owners of Bennelong Point), which accompanies a contemporary aboriginal art projection performed each evening year-round on the western sails of the Sydney opera house. In 2017 Robinson was also commissioned to compose the soundtrack for The Parrtjima Festival at Alice Springs. The festival involved five Aboriginal art centres and showcased the work of 20 Aboriginal artists. Parrtjima (pronounced Par-CHee-ma) means ‚Äòlighting up‚Äô and conveys two meanings: physically illuminating an object with light and ‚Äòlighting up‚Äô as in to shed light and understanding on a subject. This public event transformed Alice Springs Desert Park into a mesmerising outdoor gallery of light and sound including a breathtaking illumination of a 300-million-year-old natural canvas, 2 km of the majestic MacDonnell Ranges, a series of new installations involving Aboriginal artists from the Central Desert region.

In 2008 he was celebrated for summiting Mount Everest seven times, and was given the moniker \\"Mr. Everest\\". His first attempt to climb Everest in 1985 via the West Ridge, and further attempts in 1986, 1987, and 1989 were unsuccessful, but he succeeded in summitting in 1990 as part of an expedition that included Scott Fischer and Wally Berg. Athans is one of several western Himalayan guides who have adopted Nepal as a second home, and who have taken up the cause of the Sherpa people and their culture.  Rescues  In 1996 he was a key participant in the rescue of several climbers during the May 1996 Everest Disaster. For his efforts the American Alpine Club awarded him and his partner Todd Burleson and Anatoli Boukreev the David A. Sowles Memorial Award. The next year, Athans removed the body of a friend - Bruce Herrod, a South African climber who had perished just weeks after the 1996 disaster, from the climbing route high up on the mountain. He found Herrod hanging upside down by the climbing ropes that the photographer had been using to make his way down the dangerous Hillary Step section of the mountain, just below the summit. Four expeditions had climbed past his body before the removal of Herrod's body, which was cut loose and pushed over the edge. Athans returned the camera and ice axe of the dead climber to his family. The last pictures Herrod took, shortly after 5PM the night he summitted, were of himself, on the summit, smiling that he had at last reached this goal.

A multi- instrumentalist, he was known primarily for playing the electric violin and mandolin, as well as the harmonica, keyboards, glockenspiel, and other instruments (sometimes described as \\"devices\\" on album notes). Nash worked as a solo artist beginning in 1975; founding the progressive rock band FM in 1976. Soon after releasing the band's first album, Black Noise, in 1977, he left the band; he resumed his solo career in 1978 (it was not until after Nash's departure that the album was widely promoted, eventually charting and receiving a gold record award). He rejoined FM from 1983 to 1996, concurrent with his solo work. Nash's music covers an eclectic range, varying from instrumental‚Äîmood-setting music, to rock and pop music with vocals. In addition to giving concert performances, he has composed and performed soundtrack music for silent films, presenting these works live in movie theatres to accompany screenings of the films. Another venue for his music is in performances to accompany the viewing of paintings by surrealist painter Robert Vanderhorst, an audiovisual collaboration,\\"Two Artists\\". twoartists.ca. Retrieved May 12, 2014. which took place in 1978 and again in 2004. Identity Nash was born in Toronto, Ontario. He performed with surgical bandages covering his face starting in 1979. \\"During a gig at The Edge in the late 1970s to raise awareness of the threat from the Three Mile Island disaster, he walked on stage wearing bandages dipped in phosphorus paint and exclaimed: 'Look, this is what happens to you.' The bandages became his trademark.\\" Prior to 1979, Nash performed three times on TV Ontario's Nightmusic Concert, first as a solo artist (a live broadcast which was never re-aired), then with FM (Nash and Cameron Hawkins), and again as a solo artist. In all of these appearances Nash wore his typical black tuxedo, top hat, and dark sunglasses, but not his signature bandages. He was also photographed in this attire for a profile in the Toronto Star, published April 28, 1978. In later years, he attempted to keep his true identity the subject of some speculation, although the Star profile of 1978 had already matter-of- factly revealed his real name.Goddard, Peter, \\"Shadowy showman cuts an eerie album\\", The Toronto Star, April 28, 1978, page D3. Nevertheless, in a 1981 interview with the UK magazine Smash Hits, Nash was questioned about his real name, and replied with \\"Nashville Thebodiah Slasher\\". As a result of his coyness about his name, some fans came to believe that the Nash persona was an alter-ego of Ben Mink, who replaced him as FM's violinist in 1978. This is a common misconception, but he has been photographed onstage with Mink. The \\"Nash the Slash\\" persona came from silent film, and Nash said he took his stage name from that of a killer butler encountered by Laurel and Hardy in one of their first films, Do Detectives Think? (1927), for which he composed a soundtrack score. (The film character's name is actually \\"The Tipton Slasher\\"; nowhere on screen does \\"Nash the Slash\\" appear.) Images of Nash the Slash are featured in a variety of murals painted by artist Jungle Ling in Toronto. These images are located in the Leslieville district, next to a TD Bank at Queen St. East and Logan Avenue and below Queen St. East on Connaught Avenue, as part of a neighborhood beautification project conducted by the Toronto Transit Commission. Career Nash's music is a complex blend of progressive rock, New Wave, new age, and punk rock, using electric mandolins, violins, drums machines, and a variety of effects and sonic devices. He wrote, played, and produced most of the material on his solo albums by himself, though he also worked with producers Daniel Lanois and Bill Nelson. =First group= Before working as a solo artist, Nash recorded an unreleased song called \\"Slasher\\" with a group called Breathless, which also included his (and FM's) future producer, Michael Waite on bass guitar. The song appeared on a \\"various artists\\" promotional album titled Concept (after the Toronto-based management company, Concept 376; this was one of a series of such albums), but was not issued to the public in any form. The promo album does not list the group's personnel, or even a songwriting credit, but Nash is clearly heard singing a song, beginning with the lyrics \\"Hear the children of the night\\" (though this was a completely different song from his later work, \\"Children of the Night\\"), and playing electric violin. The song also featured a complex organ solo not in Nash's usual style (nor that of Cameron Hawkins, his bandmate in FM). =First solo career and film work= Nash's first solo performance and live presentation of music to film occurred when he played his soundtrack to Luis Bu√±uel's silent film Un chien andalou (1929) at the Roxy Theatre in Toronto on March 17, 1975.Dates from Dreams and Nightmares innersleeve notes. =Silent film composition= He also composed music for other classic silent films including Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). When performing soundtracks, Nash would appear on stage beside the screen (using his own projection screen when a full theatre screen is not available), the same format he uses when performing concerts. He has also composed scores for modern Canadian films Roadkill (1990) and Highway 61 (1991), both directed by Bruce McDonald. His other movie score and soundtrack work included The Kidnapping of the President (1980), Black Pearls (1989), and Blood and Donuts (1995). During this time, Nash made his first appearance on record, on David Pritchard's solo album Nocturnal Earthworm Stew (1976), with a short solo track titled \\"Nash Metropolitan\\" (named after Nash Metropolitan), and on an improvised piece with Pritchard and drummer Martin Deller (with whom he would later work in FM). He also appeared on the live TV-Ontario program Nightmusic (before its change in format, where it became Nightmusic Concert); in this incarnation, the show was a televised version of an FM radio show hosted by disc jockey Reiner Schwarz, and had not previously featured a live performer. Nash claimed he was both the first and last musical artist to appear on the show. =Work with FM= After working as a solo artist for a year, Nash formed the group FM in 1976, initially as a duo with Cameron Hawkins; drummer Martin Deller was added later. The group began recording in July 1976, though no performances in its duo format were issued at the time. However, they did appear on television and in live concerts, beginning in November 1976. In 1977, with Deller added to the group, they recorded the album Black Noise, which received a gold record award. By the end of 1977, Nash had left FM, and resumed his solo career starting with another television appearance on Nightmusic Concert on February 28, 1978. Nash rejoined FM from 1983 to 1989, and again from 1994 to 1996. During these years, he recorded a further three albums with the group. FM also recorded three albums during Nash's absence (1977 to 1980), with Ben Mink as his replacement. =Late 1970s and 1980= Nash had intended to restart his solo career in 1978 with a new album featuring all the music from his Nightmusic Concert TV special, plus his soundtrack for Un chien andalou, but found the sound quality of a test pressing to be unsatisfactory, so he issued a four-song 12-inch EP titled Bedside Companion instead, on his own label, Cut-throat Records, which he continued to operate for the rest of his life. A full album, Dreams and Nightmares with the rest of the Nightmusic material, the soundtrack, and a few new songs, appeared the following year. All music from these records was instrumental, and both are now available on one CD titled Blind Windows which also includes the 45 rpm EP playing at 33 rpm as the \\"Marsden versions\\", a joking reference to disc jockey David Marsden who mistakenly played the entire record at the wrong speed on radio when it was released. Also in 1979, Nash thanked Toronto radio station CFNY-FM for their support of his music, by playing electric violin on the station's theme song, which was recorded by various disc jockeys of the station in a strange blend of new wave and country music. It was released as \\"Working on the Radio\\" by the 102.1 Band, as a single on Ready Records. The B-side has an extended version with a longer solo by Nash, who is not credited on the cover. Nash's solo career up to this point had only a small cult following, due to his working exclusively as an instrumentalist. His next record, a 1980 single featuring a cover version of Jan and Dean's \\"Dead Man's Curve\\" with vocals, propelled him to greater public recognition. The B-side, \\"Swing Shift (Souixante-Neuf)\\" also featured vocals, and was co-composed with lyricist Toby Dammit, with whom Nash further collaborated over the next few years. Music videos were made for both songs. Nash the Slash performing at The Venue in London in 1981 Nash also played on three songs by Toronto group Drastic Measures for their self-titled album, including violins on their signature tune, a cover version of the children's song, \\"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\\". Nash's label, Cut-throat Records, later issued a single by the group, the only other artist to appear on his label, although Nash was not involved in its recording. Nash's later soundtrack album for Highway 61 includes tracks by Tony Malone, the lead singer for Drastic Measures. Nash was invited by Gary Numan to tour the UK as his support act in 1980 and 1981, and subsequently played on Numan's 1981 LP Dance. He also toured Europe with The Tubes. He was signed to the Dindisc label and in 1981, he released the album Children of the Night in Europe, also released in Canada shortly after. Several British singles were also issued. These records appeared on the Dindisc / Cut-throat label in Europe and on Virgin / Dindisc / Cut-throat in Canada. =Mid 1980s= Returning to Toronto in spring 1981, Nash released an instrumental \\"mini-album\\" Decomposing (1981), which purported to be playable at any speed, with song timings on the label quoting three lengths, depending on whether the record is played at 33, 45, or 78 rpm. However, songs from this record also appeared on compilation albums and singles, where they always play as heard when Decomposing is played at 45 rpm. This remains Nash's only significant release that has yet to be reissued on CD. Nash's next album was And You Thought You Were Normal (1982). This included the track \\"Dance After Curfew\\" produced by Daniel Lanois prior to his association with Brian Eno. The single became a surprise club and radio hit in Poland, which was then still behind the iron curtain, where curfews and restrictions on western culture were imposed by the government of the time. A 12-inch single featuring a remixed and extended version of the song was issued in the USA on PVC Records. Nash's next project was an album of American rock classics titled American Band-ages. Nash enlisted the help of his former FM collaborators Cameron Hawkins (keyboards) and Martin Deller (drums), and the album was released in 1984. The album was aimed at the US market, but due to distribution and management problems, including a change in record labels (to MCA, after Quality Records folded in 1985), it never got the exposure Nash thought it deserved. In the same year, Nash released a compilation album (with most tracks remixed) titled The Million Year Picnic on Ralph Records in the United States, the label which was home to The Residents. While working on American Band-ages in 1983, he proposed to promote it with a double bill tour with his former band FM. But Ben Mink, Nash's replacement, had left the band that year; therefore, Nash rejoined the group, staying with them from 1983 to 1989 (followed by a reunion tour from 1994 to 1996), and retaining the idea of a double bill by performing solo as the opening act. With Nash, FM released further albums: Con-Test (1985), Tonight (1987), and RetroActive (1995). In 1985, Nash sued PepsiCo for using his likeness in commercials without permission;Maple Briefs, in Billboard, page 65 (via Google Books); published 13 July 1985; retrieved May 13, 2014 PepsiCo subsequently settled out of court, pulling the commercial from broadcast and paying Nash's legal fees.2002 Interview with Nash The Slash, conducted by Dean Mason, at GaryNuman.info; published August 2002; retrieved May 13, 2014 =1990‚Äì2011= Nash the Slash in 2010 After the break-up of FM in 1989, Nash embarked on a series of film soundtrack projects, and revived his Cut-throat label in 1991 to issue these on CD, and has also used it to re-issue his earlier records. New albums of songs with vocals have also been released on the label: Thrash (1999) and In- A-Gadda-Da-Nash (2008), the latter consisting entirely of cover versions. During 1992-3 Nash the Slash collaborated with the electronic music artist Plexus to create a series of visually intense live shows called Psychedelitron. They performed Psychedelitron live between 1993‚Äì1995. In 1993, the show was performed only at Stratenger's in Toronto, Canada, every third Saturday of the month from March to October. The performed two sets, each a mix of Nash the Slash and Plexus songs. Later, in 1994 and 1995, they took the show to other venues, including the grand opening of the Toronto Public Library at 239 College Street to commemorate the inclusion of the Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation & Fantasy in this library location. Psychedelitron utilized intense visuals, including a refinement of Nash's psychedelic projector lighting, strategically placed pin lights to increase the perception of the stage size, strobe lights, fog and indirect and silhouette lighting. The techniques used during Psychedelitron, and their subsequent refinement during the reign of the shows became an important visual aspect to Nash's later shows. Psychedelitron was also used as way to re-define Nash's shows both visually and musically. In 1998, Nash performed as part of Toronto's Pride Week, publicly acknowledging that he was gay. During 2004 and 2005, he was again working with Robert Vanderhorst, under the name Two Artists, on the project View From the Gallery, a live multimedia event presenting a fusion of surrealistic visuals with classic stylings in music. Nash appeared as a character in several comic books by Matt Howarth,About, at Sonic Curiosity, by Matt Howarth; published 2002; retrieved May 13, 2014 including issues #2‚Äì7 of Savage Henry. Nash also provided original music on a CD for Howarth's graphic novel The Simultaneous Man. Nash continued to tour, mostly in his native Ontario, but occasionally elsewhere, including a 2008 tour of the UK, which resulted in a live CD/DVD. 2011 saw Nash release his first ever compilation album, The Reckless Use of Electricity. =2012= Nash announced his retirement via his website on November 6, 2012, stating he was \\"rolling up the bandages\\" and shutting down his official website on December 31. He thanked his loyal fans for their support during his 40 years as an independent artist, but stated that live gigs no longer excited him and that his \\"eccentric style/genre finds no place into today's scene.\\" He also mentioned the \\"theft of music on the internet devastated a very important source of [his] income.\\" = 2014 to present = Nash the Slash's career and recordings are being preserved by The Nash the Slash Legacy. His website was relaunched late in 2014, and costumes and instruments were donated to the National Music Centre in Calgary, AB. He was declared a Canadian Innovator by NMC and his Stephen Pollard custom skull mandolin is on display in the Canadian Music Hall of Fame wing. A distribution deal was signed with Artoffact Records in Toronto in early 2015 to release all six of his albums from the 1980s - Bedside Companion, Dreams and Nightmares, Children of the Night, the rare and previously commercially unreleased live album Hammersmith Holocaust, Decomposing as well as And You Thought You Were Normal?. Work is underway to have all his albums available again by late 2018. Filming began on a Nash the Slash documentary in early 2017. The film is being produced by Side Three Media in collaboration with The Nash the Slash Legacy and is tentatively called And You Thought You Were Normal?, with release slated for late 2018. His white tuxedo and top hat will be on display to the public and are being loaned to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, QC for a 2018 exhibit about popular music in Canada from the 1960s to 1980s.

Promoted to brigadier on the battlefield at Seven Pines by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in person, he fought in the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, being wounded in each of these engagements. Lee rated him as one of the most promising of his commanders,Tagg, p. 326, quoting Robert E. Lee. promoting him to major general at twenty-nine. Pender was mortally wounded on the second day of Gettysburg. Early life Dorsey Pender, as he was known to his friends, was born on February 6, 1834, at Pender's Crossroads, Edgecombe County, North Carolina to James and Sally Routh Pender, the youngest of four children, with two brothers and a sister. His father was a planter who owned more than 500 acres and twenty-one slaves in the vicinity of Tarboro, making the family a member of the local elite. Though descended from Virginians, Pender's parents were longtime residents of Edgecombe County. He spent his youth on the farm, hunting, fishing, and riding, before becoming a teenaged clerk in the Tarboro store owned by his older brother Robert.Wills, pp. 7‚Äì10. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1854, nineteenth out of 46 in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Artillery.Wills, pp. 19, 20. He served later in the 1st Dragoons (heavy cavalry), where he demonstrated personal bravery in Washington Territory, fighting in the Indian Wars. Civil War On March 21, 1861, Pender resigned from the U.S. Army and was appointed a captain of artillery in the Confederate States Army. By May he was a colonel in command of the 3rd North Carolina Infantry (also designated the 13th North Carolina) and then the 6th North Carolina. Tried in combat successfully in the Battle of Seven Pines in June 1862, he was promoted to brigadier general and command of a brigade of North Carolinians in Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's Light Division. Confederate President Jefferson Davis personally promoted Pender on the Seven Pines battlefield. During the Seven Days Battles, Pender was an aggressive brigade commander. He was wounded in the arm at the Battle of Glendale, but recovered quickly enough to rejoin his brigade and fight at Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas (where he received a minor head wound from an exploding shell), Harpers Ferry, and Battle of Sharpsburg. At Sharpsburg, Pender arrived in the nick of time with A.P. Hill after a 17-mile march to save the Army of Northern Virginia from serious defeat on its right flank. At Fredericksburg, he was wounded again, in his left arm, but the bone was unbroken, so he continued in command, despite the spectacle of him riding around bleeding. At Chancellorsville, on May 2, 1863, A.P. Hill was wounded in Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's famous march and attack on the flank of the Union XI Corps; Pender assumed command of the division. On the following day, Pender was wounded in the arm yet again, this time a minor injury from a spent bullet that had killed an officer who stood in front of him. Following the death of Jackson, Gen. Robert E. Lee reorganized his army and promoted A.P. Hill to command the newly formed Third Corps. Pender, at the young age of 29, was promoted to major general and division command. He was well regarded by his superiors. Lee wrote to Jefferson Davis, \\"Pender is an excellent officer, attentive, industrious and brave; has been conspicuous in every battle, and, I believe, wounded in almost all of them.\\"Official Records, Series I, Vol. XXV, Part II, Chap. XXXVII, p. 811 Death Dorsey Pender's promising career ended at the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, his division moved in support of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division down the Chambersburg Pike towards Gettysburg. Heth encountered stronger resistance from the Union I Corps than he expected and was repulsed in his first assault. Uncharacteristically for the normally aggressive Pender, he did not immediately charge in to assist Heth, but took up positions on Herr Ridge and awaited developments. In Heth's second assault of the day, Hill ordered Pender to support Heth, but Heth declined the assistance and Pender once again kept his division in the rear. For the second time in the day, Heth got more than he bargained for in his assault on McPherson's Ridge. He was wounded in action and could not request the assistance from Pender he had earlier refused. Hill ordered Pender to attack the new Union position on Seminary Ridge at about 4 p.m. The 30-minute assault by three of his brigades was very bloody and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales was almost completely destroyed by Union artillery canister fire. In the end, Pender's men forced the Union troops back in and through Gettysburg. On July 2, Pender was posted near the Lutheran Seminary. During the en echelon attack that started with James Longstreet's assault on the right, from the Round Tops through the Peach Orchard, Pender's division was to continue in the attack sequence near Cemetery Hill, to the left of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's attack on Cemetery Ridge. Pender was wounded in the thigh by a shell fragment fired from Cemetery Hill, and turned command over to Brig. Gen. James H. Lane. His division's momentum was broken by the change in command and no effective assault was completed. Pender was evacuated to Staunton, Virginia, where an artery in his leg ruptured on July 18. Surgeons amputated his leg in an attempt to save him, but he died a few hours later.Tagg, p. 327; Eicher, p. 424. His superiors wrote in their official reports of the Gettysburg Campaign about Pender's death: Legacy He is buried in the graveyard at Calvary Episcopal Church, Tarboro, North Carolina. He is memorialized in the name of Pender County, North Carolina, founded in 1875. He is the posthumous author of The General to his Lady: The Civil War letters of William Dorsey Pender to Fanny Pender, published in 1965. During World War II, the United States Navy commissioned a Liberty Ship, the SS William D. Pender, in honor of the fallen general.

It is located on the Wel river and Lake Lidzbark. The postal code for the entire area is 13-230. The town is popularly referred to as Lidzbark Welski, to distinguish it from Lidzbark Warmi≈Ñski. History Saint Adalbert church from the 18th century Lidzbark was founded in 1301. The town's Roman Catholic parish church was constructed in 1350. W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço led his army through Lidzbark on July 9, 1410 before the Battle of Grunwald. On September 29, 1413, some of the Teutonic Knights in the town revolted against Heinrich von Plauen the Elder; they were only appeased with Plauen's replacement with Michael K√ºchmeister von Sternberg. The town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In May 1454 Lidzbark pledged allegiance to the Polish King in Toru≈Ñ.Karol G√≥rski, ZwiƒÖzek Pruski i poddanie siƒô Prus Polsce: zbi√≥r tekst√≥w ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna≈Ñ, 1949, p. 76 (in Polish) At the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) the Teutonic Knights renounced claims to the town and recognized it as part of Poland. Administratively it was located in the Che≈Çmno Voivodeship in the province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. A large portion of the city was destroyed by fire in 1764. During the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772. During the Napoleonic Wars it was part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw from 1807 to 1815, but was reannexed by Prussia afterwards. In 1772, the town had 510 inhabitants and 83 timbered buildings. Agriculture was common in the area along with crafting. In 1789, the population reached 802 of which 41 families were craftsmen. In the beginning of the 20th century, the city had breweries, sawmills, iron mill, engine works and dairy products. In 1920, the area was reintegrated with Poland after it regained independence. During World War II, it was under German occupation. The population in 1943 was 4,329. 70% of the city was destroyed during the war.

The band existed from 1976 to 1989, 1994-1996, 2006, and 2011-present. They have had periods of inactivity during their existence. Their music has been categorized as space rock, and lyrics are dominated by science fiction themes. In November 2011, Cameron Hawkins reformed the band with two new players.  History  =Hawkins / Plewman \\"Nash the Slash\\" lineup= The band's original 1976 lineup consisted of two people: Cameron Hawkins on synthesizer, occasional bass guitar, and lead vocals, and Jeff Plewman (later known as Nash The Slash) on electric violin, electric mandolin, and backing vocals. The group did not use guitars. The duo first met each other while jamming with a band called Clear. The group first recorded in July 1976.Recording dates from Lost in Space liner notes A few months later, TVOntario recorded an in-studio performance for the Night Music Concert TV show, first broadcast on November 3. It is very likely this was also the date of recording. The half-hour show, shown with no commercial breaks, presented the band playing three long pieces: \\"Phasors on Stun\\", \\"One O'Clock Tomorrow\\", and \\"Black Noise\\". It also included a nonsensical biography of the group resembling free-association poetry, recited by David Pritchard (electronic musician, record producer, and CHUM-FM DJ, 1960s-1970s), accompanied by electronic background music and a collage of photos and artwork by Paul Till, appearing between the first and second songs. Neither this music, nor any performances by the original two-person lineup, were released on an album until 2001. FM's first public performance took place in November 1976 at the A Space art gallery in Toronto shortly after the TV show first aired. =Hawkins / Plewman \\"Nash the Slash\\" / Deller lineup No. 1= Some time after February 1977 the group became a trio when they added Martin Deller on drums. Deller had worked with Nash earlier in 1976 when they and David Pritchard played a 13-minute improvised piece titled \\"An Admission of Guilt\\" for Pritchard's album, Nocturnal Earthworm Stew. After appearing on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV variety show Who's New, FM was approached by the CBC to make an album, ultimately titled Black Noise, which the group presumed would be distributed in stores like a normal release. But the CBC chose to sell it by mail order and only announced its availability during several radio shows. Only 500 copies were pressed, which was sufficient to meet the demands of this limited promotion. The CBC edition's black and white cover shows a picture of a manhole cover; a different cover by Paul Till was used for later reissues on other labels. Sometime in 1977, Plewman, after recovering from a severe car/bike accident, decided to leave the band and resumed his solo career as Nash the Slash stating that the addition of a drummer gave the band a sound which was too commercial for his liking. =Hawkins / Mink / Deller lineup= Before the end of 1977, Plewman [now 'Nash The Slash' solo artist] was replaced by Ben Mink, who also played electric violin and electric mandolin. Their first record was Direct to Disc (also released as Head Room, or Headroom), and was made using the direct to disc recording method, in which recording tape is not used. Several editions of the album exist. Later in 1978, the group got its first proper record contract with Visa Records in the USA, and Passport Records in Canada, the latter distributed by GRT Records. (Passport was a sub-label of Visa, although Passport was the more prolific of the two labels.) Their first release for these labels was a reissue of the CBC album, Black Noise, now made available in stores for the first time. The USA edition was released in the summer of 1978, while the Canadian edition came out near the end of the year. A single from the album, \\"Phasors on Stun\\" helped to promote the album, for which the group were presented a gold record award. However, Cameron Hawkins claims they never received royalty payments from any of the Canadian LP editions, as their contract specified all payments were to come through Visa Records in the USA, and none of the three Canadian distributors passed royalties on to Visa. Black Noise was followed by Surveillance in the summer of 1979, the first widely released album with the group's then-current lineup, although it was delayed because GRT Records went out of business one week before the intended release date. Canadian distribution of the Passport label was bought out by Capitol Records who subsequently released both albums. In 1981 the Passport label declared bankruptcy, but was rescued again the following year by new Canadian distributor A&M; Records, who reissued Black Noise again. In 1980, FM released another album, City of Fear, produced by Larry Fast who under the name \\"Synergy\\" released a series of electronic music albums as well as playing keyboards on Peter Gabriel's early albums. Ben Mink also recorded an instrumental solo album, Foreign Exchange with the other members of FM as his backing band. Ben Mink left FM in 1983. =Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Deller lineup No. 2= In 1983, Nash the Slash proposed a future double bill tour with FM, as the two artists seemed to share a common audience, since FM's best known previous album was the one he made with them in 1977. But they had still not found a replacement for Ben Mink. Nash resolved the problem by rejoining the band. Just as work was beginning on a new album in 1984, Passport Records folded for the third and final time. Nash had been signed to Quality Records as a solo artist in 1983, and was about to release his solo album American Band-ages, which the originally proposed tour had been intended to promote, and was able to get FM signed to the label as well. The other two members of FM also play on Nash's album. The double bill concept was retained, with Nash playing a solo set as the opening act for FM concerts. The FM album, released in 1985, was titled Con-Test. Ben Mink also appears on the album. A live show at the Masonic Temple in Toronto was videotaped and aired by the CBC as one of its Rock Deluxe TV specials in 1985. FM seemed to be cursed by record labels going out of business. The Quality Records company had existed since the early 1950s, and by the 1960s was Canada's biggest domestic label; but they ceased operations shortly after the album was released. MCA Records picked up the reissue rights for Con-Test, as well as Nash's American Band-ages, but the abrupt change in record labels led to a near-absence of promotion for both records. Martin Deller left the band at the conclusion of its 1986 tour. =Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Brierly / Critchley lineup= In 1986, FM replaced Deller with Greg Critchley (ex The Partland Brothers and The Spoons) on drums, and added Simon Brierley (ex Lee Aaron's band and Strange Advance) on guitars. Before this time, FM (and Nash as a solo artist) were notable for not using electric guitars, therefore this change made a significant alteration to their sound. They recorded Tonight for Duke Street Records, with the first pressing issued on green vinyl. Duke Street also issued the album on CD, with five bonus tracks from Con-Test, followed by a CD edition of the earlier album. Five songs were also used in the horror film Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988). =Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Brierly / Cooke lineup= In 1988, Randy Cooke replaced Greg Critchley on drums. This lineup disbanded after touring the Tonight album. =Hawkins / Shaw / Brierly / Marangoni lineup= In 1989, FM consisted of Hawkins and Brierly, augmented by the new members Martin Shaw (also known as Marty Warsh) on mandolin and violin and drummer Paul Marangoni. Information on this lineup is scarce, and though Marangoni has stated that this line-up planned to record, they disbanded in the early 1990s. Marangoni has since shared footage of this lineup on YouTube. =Hawkins / Nash the Slash / Deller lineup No. 3= In 1994, Cameron Hawkins created a new record company called Now See Hear Records (initially self- distributed, but later distributed by MCA Records as of 1996), and purchased the rights to Black Noise which was still owned by the CBC, but ownership was set to expire that year. Hawkins was surprised to find a competitor bidding for the rights, but his label emerged as the winning bidder. By this time, the CBC no longer possessed a master tape of the album. A search for the tape at the CBC turned up a reel tape box with an inferior cassette copy inside. Hawkins then travelled to the USA to search the former Passport Records vaults for the tapes of this, and the other Passport albums, without success. Ultimately, the Now See Hear reissue of Black Noise was made from a transfer from vinyl. Now See Hear also licensed the recording to One Way Records, a company specializing in reissues, who released an American edition. The reissue was followed by a reformation of the group's classic lineup for a series of concerts from 1994 to 1996, resulting in a new live CD titled RetroActive recorded November 1994 in Toronto, and issued on Now See Hear in 1995. The album included some previously unrecorded songs. In 2001, Nash the Slash compiled unreleased and live FM recordings from the 1970s and 1980s on a CD titled Lost in Space on his own Cut-throat Records label. This release was not approved by the other members, and did not mention the name FM; the artist was listed as \\"Nash the Slash, Cameron Hawkins & Martin Deller\\". It includes recordings made by the original Hawkins / Nash the Slash lineup in 1976 and 1977, and demo versions of songs for Con-Test recorded in 1984. =Hawkins / Vena / Deller lineup= In 2006, FM reformed again for a live performance at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA on June 24, and also gave a concert prior to this in Toronto on June 16. The new lineup included Italian musician Claudio Vena on electric violin and electric mandolin. New CD and DVD recordings by this lineup have been issued, and the band's website has not been updated since 2006. In 2010, Martin Deller uploaded a video on YouTube, advertising for drumming and recording lessons. The video consists of clips from the NEARfest 2006 performance which is also mentioned as being an upcoming release. =2011 to 2014= Since 2011, Cameron Hawkins has worked on material with a new incarnation of FM. Joining Hawkins are Paul DeLong on drums, Aaron Solomon on violin, and Ed Bernard of Druckfarben on viola and mandolin. The band is putting the finishing touches on songs for a new album that is to be released by Esoteric Recordings. On May 12, 2014, Nash the Slash died at age 66. =2015= FM's first studio album in 28 years, Transformation, was released in April, 2015 via Esoteric/Cherry Red Recordings. The lineup was Hawkins (bass, keyboards), Paul DeLong (drums), Edward Bernard (viola, mandolin), and Aaron Solomon (violin).

It is closely related to the sooty grouse (Dendragapus fuliginosus), and the two were previously considered a single species, the blue grouse. Description Adults have a long square tail, gray at the end. Adult males are mainly dark with a purplish throat air sac surrounded by white, and a yellow to red wattle over the eye during display. Adult females are mottled brown with dark brown and white marks on the underparts. Their breeding habitat is the edges of conifer and mixed forests in mountainous regions of western North America, from southeastern Alaska and Yukon south to New Mexico. Their range is closely associated with that of various conifers. Their nest is a scrape on the ground concealed under a shrub or log. They are permanent residents but move short distances by foot and short flights to denser forest areas in winter, with the odd habit of moving to higher altitudes in winter. These birds forage on the ground, or in trees in winter. In winter, they mainly eat fir and douglas-fir needles, occasionally also hemlock and pine needles; in summer, other green plants (Pteridium, Salix), berries (Gaultheria, Mahonia, Rubus, Vaccinium), and insects (particularly ants, beetles, grasshoppers) are more important. Chicks are almost entirely dependent on insect food for their first ten days. Males sing with deep hoots on their territory and make short flapping flights to attract females. Females leave the male's territory after mating.

He was a missionary from the Church of the East (also known as the \\"Nestorian Church\\"), and probably a Syriac speaker from the Sasanian Empire or from Byzantine Syria. He is known exclusively from the Nestorian Stele, which describes his arrival in the Tang capital of Chang'an in 635 and his acceptance by Emperor Taizong of Tang. His is the earliest known name that can be attached to the history of the Church of the East in China. History Alopen's name is known only from the Chinese of the Nestorian Stele. This may be a transliteration of the Semitic \\"Abraham\\". or aloho punoya, \\"the conversion of God.\\". According to the Stele, Alopen and his fellow missionaries came to China from Daqin (or Ta Tsin ‚Äì the Byzantine Empire) in the ninth year of Emperor Taizong (Tai Tsung; 635), bringing sacred books and images. He would have come to China via the Silk Road. The Nestorian mission benefited from Taizong's policy of religious tolerance, which reversed measures his father Gaozu had taken against Buddhism and other foreign religions and influences. According to the Stele, Taizong welcomed Alopen and arranged for the translation of the holy writings he had brought with him at the Imperial Library. Upon studying them, Taizong, a great scholar and patron, found them most acceptable and arranged for their dissemination. Indeed, four documents from the early period of Christianity in China date to around Alopen's time. Three years later, in 638, Taizong issued an official declaration protecting the Nestorian church. He erected China's first Christian church and recognized twenty-one priests, likely all Persians, to administer it. Under Taizong's son and successor Gaozong, who continued this policy of toleration, Alopen's status expanded even further, and he was appointed bishop over the many churches built by the emperor. After Alopen's time, the Church of the East was prominent in China for the remainder of the Tang Dynasty's power. Different emperors treated it differently, with some showing it the tolerance it received in the early decades, and some openly persecuting it. Nestorianism disappeared with the fall of the Tang Dynasty in the early 10th century. It did not return for three centuries, when it was reintroduced by the Mongols. The story of Alopen became prominent again in the 17th century, when the Nestorian Stele was rediscovered and the Chinese were surprised to find that the \\"new\\" religion being preached by the missionaries, had actually been in existence in China more than 10 centuries earlier.

It was invented by Liu Chung-tz'u (ÂäâÈáçÊ¨°). Boshiamy uses about 300 radicals represented by 26 letters to build characters. Radicals are mapped to letters by their shapes, sounds or meanings. Boshiamy has become one of the fastest input methods by shortening codes of many characters. Speeds exceeding 200 characters per minute have been achieved in typing contests. Boshiamy was originally designed to input traditional Chinese characters, but now it also supports simplified Chinese character input. However, it is commercial software, and users may not be able to use it on some computers. A trial version with fewer characters is available on the official site. Categories of radicals The inventor of Boshiamy divided radicals into several categories as a mnemonic for learners to master radicals. All categories of radicals are treated equally in practice. =Shapes= Some radicals are mapped to letters with similar shapes. For example, some characters which entirely consists of these radicals are Âìà (O, A, O), ÂëΩ (A, O, P), and Â∑û (Y, Y, Y). =Sounds= Some radicals are mapped to letters by their sounds. For example, the character Á≤â is represented as MBD, which respectively correspond to the radicals Á±≥ (m«ê), ÂÖ´ (bƒÅ), and ÂàÄ (dƒÅo). Also, some radicals are mapped to letters with English names similar to their pronunciations: ‰∏Ä (yƒ´) is E, ‰∫å (√®r) is R, Ë•ø (xƒ´) is C. =Meanings= Some radicals are mapped to the first letters of their English meanings. For example, Êú® (tree) is T, Ëªä (car) is C, ‰∏≠ (center) is C. = Variants = Some radicals look similar to other radicals, and are mapped to the same letter. For example, Âè≤ is similar to ‰∏≠, and is represented by C. =Others= A few radicals are mapped to letters arbitrarily. For example, Êâç is U, Ëàá is E, Âúü is Y.  Rules of character input  = Order = Characters are decomposed into what users call \\"eye order\\" (ÁúºÈ†Ü), that is essentially from left to right, from top to bottom. Because of the numerous radicals available, decomposition is not difficult. For some characters the order differs from stroke order; for example the dot of Êàà is written last, but is taken first in the code because it is at the top. = Supplementary letter = The first three and the last radical of a character are taken as its code. If there are less than three letters, a supplementary letter (Ë£úÁ¢º) is added according to the shape of the last stroke of character. For example, the codes of ‰∏≠ and Âè≤ are both C, which have one letter only, so supplementary letter I and X are added respectively, making their codes CI and CX. = Selection = In case more than one character correspond to the same code, an extra letter can be added for selection. For example, there are three characters (Áéª, Áé´ and Êî∑) for the code KPX. Áéª can be input directly with this code, Áé´ can be input by appending V to the code, and Êî∑ by appending R. Boshiamy allows a maximum of five letters to be inputted at a time, so even for four-letter code an extra letter can still be added. Characters can also be selected by number keys.  Shortening of code  To increase input speed, a number of most common characters are given shorter codes of one or two letters. For example, ÁöÑ (originally PDNA) is D, Â∞ç (FEBA) is A, ÊúÉ (AQD) is AD. Additional \\"brevity radicals\\" (Á∞°ÈÄüÂ≠óÊ†π) are made available for shortening the codes of more characters. For example, the original code of Êèê is JDEZ with the usual radicals, but using a brevity radical ÊòØ (J), it is shortened to JJN (with supplementary letter N for the last stroke). Boshiamy provides a special input mode for users to master these short codes. In this mode, users can only input a character by its shortest code, otherwise it does not output the character, but instead shows users the character alongside its shortest code.  Other features  Boshiamy supports Unicode. Zhuyin, Japanese kanji and kana, and other special symbols can be input directly with Boshiamy. Users can add new codes for characters or phrases.

A simple two-point estimation is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points (x, f(x)) and (x + h, f(x + h)).Richard L. Burden, J. Douglas Faires (2000), Numerical Analysis, (7th Ed), Brooks/Cole. . Choosing a small number h, h represents a small change in x, and it can be either positive or negative. The slope of this line is : \\\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}. This expression is Newton's difference quotient (also known as a first-order divided difference). The slope of this secant line differs from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to h. As h approaches zero, the slope of the secant line approaches the slope of the tangent line. Therefore, the true derivative of f at x is the limit of the value of the difference quotient as the secant lines get closer and closer to being a tangent line: : f'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}. Since immediately substituting 0 for h results in \\\\frac{0}{0} indeterminate form , calculating the derivative directly can be unintuitive. Equivalently, the slope could be estimated by employing positions (x ‚àí h) and x. Another two-point formula is to compute the slope of a nearby secant line through the points (x - h, f(x ‚àí h)) and (x + h, f(x + h)). The slope of this line is : \\\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}. This formula is known as the symmetric difference quotient. In this case the first-order errors cancel, so the slope of these secant lines differ from the slope of the tangent line by an amount that is approximately proportional to h^2. Hence for small values of h this is a more accurate approximation to the tangent line than the one-sided estimation. However, although the slope is being computed at x, the value of the function at x is not involved. The estimation error is given by : R = \\\\frac{-f^{(3)}(c)}{6} h^2, where c is some point between x - h and x + h. This error does not include the rounding error due to numbers being represented and calculations being performed in limited precision. The symmetric difference quotient is employed as the method of approximating the derivative in a number of calculators, including TI-82, TI-83, TI-84, TI-85, all of which use this method with h = 0.001. Step size Example showing the difficulty of choosing h due to both rounding error and formula error An important consideration in practice when the function is calculated using floating-point arithmetic is the choice of step size, h. If chosen too small, the subtraction will yield a large rounding error. In fact, all the finite- difference formulae are ill-conditionedNumerical Differentiation of Analytic Functions, B Fornberg ‚Äì ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), 1981. and due to cancellation will produce a value of zero if h is small enough.Using Complex Variables to Estimate Derivatives of Real Functions, W. Squire, G. Trapp ‚Äì SIAM REVIEW, 1998. If too large, the calculation of the slope of the secant line will be more accurately calculated, but the estimate of the slope of the tangent by using the secant could be worse. For basic central differences, the optimal step is the cube-root of machine epsilon.Sauer, Timothy (2012). Numerical Analysis. Pearson. p.248. For the numerical derivative formula evaluated at x and x + h, a choice for h that is small without producing a large rounding error is \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} x (though not when x = 0), where the machine epsilon Œµ is typically of the order of 2.2 for double precision.Following Numerical Recipes in C, Chapter 5.7. A formula for h that balances the rounding error against the secant error for optimum accuracy isp. 263. : h = 2\\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon\\\\left\\\\frac{f(x)}{f(x)}\\\\right} (though not when f(x) = 0), and to employ it will require knowledge of the function. For single precision the problems are exacerbated because, although x may be a representable floating-point number, x + h almost certainly will not be. This means that x + h will be changed (by rounding or truncation) to a nearby machine-representable number, with the consequence that (x + h) ‚àí x will not equal h; the two function evaluations will not be exactly h apart. In this regard, since most decimal fractions are recurring sequences in binary (just as 1/3 is in decimal) a seemingly round step such as h = 0.1 will not be a round number in binary; it is 0.000110011001100...2 A possible approach is as follows: h := sqrt(eps) * x; xph := x + h; dx := xph - x; slope := (F(xph) - F(x)) / dx; However, with computers, compiler optimization facilities may fail to attend to the details of actual computer arithmetic and instead apply the axioms of mathematics to deduce that dx and h are the same. With C and similar languages, a directive that xph is a volatile variable will prevent this. Other methods =Higher-order methods= Higher-order methods for approximating the derivative, as well as methods for higher derivatives, exist. Given below is the five-point method for the first derivative (five- point stencil in one dimension):Abramowitz & Stegun, Table 25.2. : f'(x) = \\\\frac{-f(x + 2h) + 8 f(x + h) - 8 f(x - h) + f(x - 2h)}{12h} + \\\\frac{h^4}{30} f^{(5)}(c), where c \\\\in [x - 2h, x + 2h]. For other stencil configurations and derivative orders, the Finite Difference Coefficients Calculator is a tool that can be used to generate derivative approximation methods for any stencil with any derivative order (provided a solution exists). = Higher derivatives = Using Newton's difference quotient, : f'(x) = \\\\lim_{h \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} the following can be shown (for n>0): :f^{(n)}(x) = \\\\lim_{h\\\\to 0} \\\\frac{1}{h^n} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{k+n} \\\\binom{n}{k} f(x + kh). Complex- variable methods The classical finite-difference approximations for numerical differentiation are ill-conditioned. However, if f is a holomorphic function, real-valued on the real line, which can be evaluated at points in the complex plane near x, then there are stable methods. For example, the first derivative can be calculated by the complex-step derivative formula:Differentiation With(out) a Difference by Nicholas Higham article from MathWorks blog, posted by Cleve Moler :f^\\\\prime(x) = \\\\Im(f(x + \\\\mathrm{i}h))/h+O(h^2), \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{i}:=\\\\sqrt{-1}. This formula can be obtained by Taylor series expansion: :f(x+\\\\mathrm{i}h) = f(x)+\\\\mathrm{i}hf^\\\\prime(x)-h^2f(x)/2!-\\\\mathrm{i}h^3f^{(3)}(x)/3!+\\\\cdots. The complex-step derivative formula is only valid for calculating first-order derivatives. A generalization of the above for calculating derivatives of any order employ multicomplex numbers, resulting in multicomplex derivatives. In general, derivatives of any order can be calculated using Cauchy's integral formulaAblowitz, M. J., Fokas, A. S.,(2003). Complex variables: introduction and applications. Cambridge University Press. Check theorem 2.6.2: : f^{(n)}(a) = \\\\frac{n!}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(z)}{(z - a)^{n+1}} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}z, where the integration is done numerically. Using complex variables for numerical differentiation was started by Lyness and Moler in 1967. A method based on numerical inversion of a complex Laplace transform was developed by Abate and Dubner. An algorithm that can be used without requiring knowledge about the method or the character of the function was developed by Fornberg. Differential quadrature Differential quadrature is the approximation of derivatives by using weighted sums of function values.Differential Quadrature and Its Application in Engineering: Engineering Applications, Chang Shu, Springer, 2000, .Advanced Differential Quadrature Methods, Yingyan Zhang, CRC Press, 2009, . The name is in analogy with quadrature, meaning numerical integration, where weighted sums are used in methods such as Simpson's method or the Trapezoidal rule. There are various methods for determining the weight coefficients. Differential quadrature is used to solve partial differential equations.

It was formerly broadcast from KFGO in Fargo, North Dakota. It was heard on a network of over 100 stations, including seven of the ten largest radio markets. It was also on XM and Sirius satellite radio. Schultz's radio show moved to New York City in May 2009, a relocation brought on by the launch of his new television show, The Ed Show, on MSNBC.  History  Schultz launched The Ed Schultz Show on January 5, 2004. Created and financed by Democracy Radio and distributed by Jones Radio Networks, the show started in two markets (Needles, California and Langdon, North Dakota) and quickly grew, signing another dozen stations in smaller, mostly upper Midwest markets. For a while, Schultz continued his News and Views broadcasts, though by February 2005 it was announced that Joel Heitkamp, a North Dakota state senator, was taking over that show. On February 1, 2007, Ed Schultz returned to hosting the News and Views show. After growing to approximately 95 affiliates, Democracy Radio sold its majority stake in The Ed Schultz Show to Product First in June 2005, a company started by Randy Michaels and Stu Krane, who had previously been involved with launching Rush Limbaugh's radio show. Distribution continued with Jones Radio Networks and subsequently by its successor, Dial Global. Schultz's flagship KFGO dropped The Ed Schultz Show between January 2006 and February 2007 due to an apparent conflict with the station's management which new ownership cleared up. Fargo's KQWB aired the program in the interim. In 2009, Talkers magazine rated Ed Schultz as the 18th most important talk show host in the United States.Talkers Magazine - List of radio hosts During his show on May 24, 2011, Schultz called Laura Ingraham both a \\"right-wing slut\\" and a \\"talk slut\\". Feminist organizations, including the Women's Media Center, called for his suspension. The following day he issued an apology, saying he \\"used vile and inappropriate language when talking about talk show host Laura Ingraham. I am deeply sorry, and I apologize. It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness,\\" and offering an indefinite self-suspension without pay.Huffington Post: Ed Schultz Apologizes: Laura Ingraham Comments 'Vile And Inappropriate'. May 26, 2011. MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave. In May 2014, Schultz announced he was replacing his three-hour weekday radio program with a one-hour program, and shifting to a Web format. Schultz continued to host his Ed Show television program, which was then aired on weekdays at 5 p.m. ET.Ed Schultz' radio show to change format, platform, MSNBC (May 21, 2014).

He told the Teamsters Unity Conference in 2012: \\"The same way this country was built by labor, it can be rebuilt by labor.\\" It was common for Schultz to interview union and other labor leaders. Ed Schultz often brought Los Angeles lawyer Norman Goldman to his show for legal analysis, thus given the title of \\"Senior Legal Analyst\\" by Schultz. Goldman filled in on the radio show when Schultz was traveling or on vacation. Reliably holding Schultz's high ratings, Goldman now produces his own nationally heard talk showThe Norman Goldman Show, http://normangoldman.com during the 3-6 PM West Coast time slot. Tony Trupiano also filled in on Schultz's show when Schultz was absent. The third hour of every Friday show was dedicated to \\"recession busting\\" where small business owners called in to promote their business for the hour. Like other popular polemic, political radio shows, Schultz used humorous, often somewhat derogatory nicknames for a number of public figures. These included \\"Slant Head\\" for conservative commentator Sean Hannity, \\"the Druggie\\" or \\"the Drugster\\" for Rush Limbaugh, \\"Shooter\\" for Vice President Dick Cheney, \\"Rotten Rudy\\" for former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani, \\"The Mittster\\" for Mitt Romney, and \\"the pizza man\\" for Herman Cain.

Nearly a century after its inception, tubular steel remains the prime choice for the cantilever chair with Marcel Breuer being perhaps the greatest champion of this design technique; using the overhanging cantilever styling in both his furniture and architecture. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto are other historical figures who contributed to the popularity of the cantilever chair. With the creation of his Wassily Chair in 1925, Marcel Breuer holds the distinction of first using bent and polished tubular steel as both a supporting framework and a decorative element for furniture.

Awareness ribbons are symbols meant to show support or raise consciousness for a cause. Different colours and patterns are associated with different issues. Yellow ribbons, in the United States, are used to show that a close family member is abroad in military service. In Russia, Belarus and other countries of the former Soviet Union, gold and black striped ribbons are used to celebrate the Allies' victory in World War II (9 May). In Spain since 2017 a yellow ribbon is a symbol of solidarity with the 2017‚Äì18 Spanish constitutional crisis in provisional detention. Of the uses of ribbons to draw awareness to health issues, perhaps the best-known is the pink ribbon for support of those with breast cancer. Other health and social concerns which have adopted coloured ribbons include Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer (purple), HIV/AIDS (red), bipolar disorder (green), and brain disorder or disability (silver). Political use of ribbons include red ribbons worn to commemorate the October Revolution (7 November) in the former Soviet Union, and orange ribbons in the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Other ornaments, including flowers (of specific kinds), bracelets and badges may serve essentially the same purpose of drawing attention to a cause. These include poppies, rosettes and wristbands.  History  The first ribbons that were represented as meaningful objects in history were the tokens given to knights during the Middle Ages in Europe. The yellow ribbon came from the Puritan Army during the English Civil War. From there, it spread to the Americas, where the Army of the United States became associated with it. A yellow ribbon was mentioned in a marching song, sung by the military in the United States. In the year 1917 George A. Norton copyrighted the song for the first time. The title of the song was \\"Round Her Neck She Wears a Yeller Ribbon\\". In the 1940s the song was rewritten by several musicians. Yellow ribbon marking a tree In the early 1970s, the song \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\" was released, and based on this song, a wife of a hostage in Iran, Penney Laingen, was the first who used the ribbon as an awareness symbol. She tied yellow ribbons around trees, to illustrate desire for her husband coming home. Her friends and family members followed the trend. As many individuals were able to see this message, the \\"ribbon became a medium\\". During the 1979‚Äì1981 spate of child murders in Atlanta, green lapel ribbons began to be worn to show solidarity. They were of a different form than later awareness ribbons, being typically bow-shaped. In May 1986, the AIDS Faith Alliance, later to be known as Christian Action on AIDS,The Times, London, Saturday September 20, 1986, Court and Social held an open conference on AIDS at Notting Hill Gate in London, supported by the Archbishop of Canterbury and other United Kingdom Christian church leaders. Rainbow Ribbons were given to everybody attending. The purpose of Christian Action on AIDS, an official Church of England charity whose founder/chairman was Barnaby Miln, was to get the worldwide Christian churches involved in the crisis that was AIDS. The Christian Action on AIDS to fold in 1991. In 1991, the red ribbon was created by the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus,CNN, \\"Red ribbon: Celebrating 20 years of the iconic AIDS symbol\\" a New York-based group of artists and AIDS activist. They wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers. The color red was chosen for its \\"connection to blood and the idea of passion\\"‚Äîboth anger and love. During the 1991 Tony Awards, actor Jeremy Irons wore the bright red ribbon pinned on his chest. Though the symbolism of the ribbon was not allowed to be discussed on air, the media and public noticed the eye catching ribbon, and its popularity grew overnight. The red ribbon was purposefully not copyrighted in the United States, to allow it to be worn and used widely as a symbol in the fight against AIDS. The year 1992 was declared by The New York Times as \\"The year of the Ribbon\\". Today the red ribbon is an internationally recognized symbol of AIDS awareness and a design icon. It has led the way for many other color ribbons and awareness projects. The Unicode character standard has a \\"reminder ribbon\\" character (üéóÔ∏è) at code point U+1F397. No color is specified for it, and platforms vary in its presentation; it can appear yellow, blue, or red depending on the device or software in which it is viewed.  Purpose and usage  Ribbons can be used simply to raise awareness of a disease or signify that an individual has been personally affected by that disease or condition. People often place ribbons around college campuses, throughout neighborhoods, and in public business places so that others can see them and realize they are not alone in their battle. Ribbon colors are often associated with one or more conditions but there are several sources that define what color relates to which condition. They also provide an outline of the dates in which that ribbon is significant. Ribbons are often promoted to signify the prevalence of a specific disease or condition. There are ribbon colors that also associate with animals and organization that work with animals. The Animal Legal Defense Fund fights for the rights of all animals alike while displaying and orange ribbon. Animal abuse awareness is also well known for its use of the purple ribbon.  Significance  Awareness ribbons have the potential to bring a community of people together. October is breast cancer awareness month and is symbolized by the pink ribbon. Sports teams, business places, and even schools take advantage of the well known pink ribbon and use this month as a time for raising funds to go towards research in the area of the disease. This is also common for AIDS awareness, symbolized by a red ribbon. Apple produced an iPhone in March 2017 that was red to promote awareness for AIDS. Portions of the proceeds from this iPhone went towards research for AIDS.

They gained notoriety in 1993 by switching the voice boxes on talking G.I. Joes and Barbie dolls. The BLO performed \\"surgery\\" on a reported 300‚Äì500 dolls and then returned them to the shelves of stores, an action they refer to as shopgiving. This action resulted in girls opening their new Teen Talk Barbie to hear it say phrases such as \\"vengeance is mine\\" and boys hearing their G.I. Joe say \\"The beach is the place for summer.\\"  Motivation and context  The BLO was originally conceived in an effort to question and ultimately change the gender stereotypes American culture is known for after Mattel released a speaking Barbie that said \\"Math class is tough.\\" It took place in the middle of the culture wars of the 1990s when creative dissent was once again gaining popularity and artists and activists were often trying to conceive of new ways to rebel against cultural stereotypes and powerful forms like network TV. By 1993, criticism of Barbie as a negative gender stereotype for women was commonplace both in academia and popular culture. This may have been partially responsible for the generally positive response of the public to the project‚Äîthe criticism they were making was familiar and not a controversial point to make during the 1990s. Although their criticism was not new, the creative form of hacking used by the BLO was noteworthy.  Methods  There is a detailed description of the complex \\"surgery\\" they performed originally available on their website, now archived elsewhere, encouraging others to take part in the surgeries themselves. The surgery required some technical skills, tools and precision, but the voice boxes in the dolls were similar enough that the surgery could be reproduced fairly easily in other parts of the country. They outlined the surgery in easy to understand images. After the surgery they would secretly return the toys to shelves, what they call reverse shoplifting. Therefore, everything they did was perfectly legal. They also produced a video to explain their point.http://www.vdb.org/smackn.acgi$tapedetail?BLONIGHTLY video They used the familiar form of the nightly news message, collaged with cutting edge video art techniques to get their point across. Viewers would be unable to tell exactly what was news and what was made up, they made some points through exaggerations and some through the use of actual news footage. They recruited two children, one from San Diego, California, and one from Albany, New York, to showcase the modified toys to the news. Additionally, the BLO used their extra stock of modified dolls to go to stores that were near news stations that were covering the story, planted a modified doll on the shelf, and waited for the journalists to purchase the BLO's toy; this would show the reach and a seemingly large scale operation. Having children already prepped to be interviewed and planning ahead to gain media coverage helped the BLO's image and reach. The media responded with coverage, but no legal issues were ever seriously raised. Hasbro and Mattel, the makers of the dolls brushed off the action with little fuss, although one person was outraged with the \\"terrorist attacks\\" directed at children.  Controversy  Because of the nature of culture jamming, it is hard to tell how many Barbies and G.I. Joes were actually switched, and how much of the media attention was orchestrated by the group. The artist Igor Vamos, known for acts of media intervention, intentionally fed information to the media to report more cases of the switched identity surgeries. Although most sources suggest from 300‚Äì500 toys were hacked, other reports up to 3,000 across the country and in other countries like Canada, France and England. Others assert that only 12 toys were actually switched and the rest was cleverly arranged media hype by Vamos and his associates. This perspective indicates that the project was also a critique of the nature of the television and media culture of the 1990s, which led to other media interventions by Vamos, collaborators, and other groups in the coming years.

Arithmetic underflow can occur when the true result of a floating point operation is smaller in magnitude (that is, closer to zero) than the smallest value representable as a normal floating point number in the target datatype. Underflow can in part be regarded as negative overflow of the exponent of the floating point value. For example, if the exponent part can represent values from ‚àí128 to 127, then a result with a value less than ‚àí128 may cause underflow. Storing values that are too low in an integer variable (e.g., attempting to store ‚àí1 in an unsigned integer) is properly referred to as integer , or more broadly, integer wraparound. The term underflow normally refers to floating point numbers only, which is a separate issue. It is not possible in most floating-point designs to store a too-low value, as usually they are signed and have a negative infinity value. Underflow gap The interval between ‚àífminN and fminN, where fminN is the smallest positive normal floating point value, is called the underflow gap. This is because the size of this interval is many orders of magnitude larger than the distance between adjacent normal floating point values just outside the gap. For instance, if the floating point datatype can represent 20 bits, the underflow gap is 221 times larger than the absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap. In older designs, the underflow gap had just one usable value, zero. When an underflow occurred, the true result was replaced by zero (either directly by the hardware, or by system software handling the primary underflow condition). This replacement is called \\"flush to zero\\". The 1984 edition of IEEE 754 introduced subnormal numbers. The subnormal numbers (including zero) fill the underflow gap with values where the absolute distance between adjacent values is the same as for adjacent values just outside the underflow gap. This enables \\"gradual underflow\\", where a nearest subnormal value is used, just as a nearest normal value is used when possible. Even when using gradual underflow, the nearest value may be zero. The absolute distance between adjacent floating point values just outside the gap is called the machine epsilon, typically characterized by the largest value whose sum with the value 1 will result in the answer with value 1 in that floating point scheme. This can be written as fl(1+\\\\epsilon) = 1, where fl() is a function which converts the real value into the floating point representation. While the machine epsilon is not to be confused with the underflow level (assuming subnormal numbers), it is closely related. The machine epsilon is dependent on the number of bits which make up the significand, whereas the underflow level depends on the number of digits which make up the exponent field. In most floating point systems, the underflow level is smaller than the machine epsilon. Handling of underflow The occurrence of an underflow may set a (\\"sticky\\") status bit, raise an exception, at the hardware level generate an interrupt, or may cause some combination of these effects. As specified in IEEE 754, the underflow condition is only signaled if there is also a loss of precision. Typically this is determined as the final result being inexact. However, if the user is trapping on underflow, this may happen regardless of consideration for loss of precision. The default handling in IEEE 754 for underflow (as well as other exceptions) is to record as a floating point status that underflow has occurred. This is specified for the application- programming level, but often also interpreted as how to handle it at the hardware level.

NeuNAc, an acetylated derivative of the carbohydrate sialic acid, makes the head groups of gangliosides anionic at pH 7, which distinguishes them from globosides. The name ganglioside was first applied by the German scientist Ernst Klenk in 1942 to lipids newly isolated from ganglion cells of the brain. More than 60 gangliosides are known, which differ from each other mainly in the position and number of NANA residues. It is a component of the cell plasma membrane that modulates cell signal transduction events, and appears to concentrate in lipid rafts. Recently, gangliosides have been found to be highly important molecules in immunology. Natural and semisynthetic gangliosides are considered possible therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders. Location Gangliosides are present and concentrated on cell surfaces, with the two hydrocarbon chains of the ceramide moiety embedded in the plasma membrane and the oligosaccharides located on the extracellular surface, where they present points of recognition for extracellular molecules or surfaces of neighboring cells. They are found predominantly in the nervous system where they constitute 6% of all phospholipids. Function The oligosaccharide groups on gangliosides extend well beyond the surfaces of the cell membranes, and act as distinguishing surface markers that can serve as specific determinants in cellular recognition and cell-to-cell communication. These carbohydrate head groups also act as specific receptors for certain pituitary glycoprotein hormones and certain bacterial protein toxins such as cholera toxin. The functions of gangliosides as specific determinants suggest its important role in the growth and differentiation of tissues as well as in carcinogenesis. It has been found that tumor formation can induce the synthesis of a new complement of ganglioside, and very low concentrations of a specific ganglioside can induce differentiation of cultured neuronal tumor cells.

They are degraded to ceramides by sequential removal of sugar units in the oligosaccharide group, catalyzed by a set of highly specific lysosomal enzymes. Mutations in genes coding for these enzymes leads to the accumulation of partially broken down gangliosides in lysosomes, which results in a group of diseases called gangliosidosis. For example, the fatal Tay‚ÄìSachs disease arises as a genetic defect which leads to no functional hexosaminidase A produced, causing GM2 to accumulate in lysosomes. Ultimately the ganglion cells in the nervous system swell enormously, disturbing the normal functions of neurons. A summary showing the causes of sphingolipidosis, including gangliosidosis. Gangliosides are also involved in several diseases: *Influenza, in which haemagglutinin of influenza virus exploits certain gangliosides to enter and infect the cells expressing them. *Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, which has been linked to the production of anti-ganglioside antibodies. *Cholera *Tetanus *Botulism *Leprosy *Obesity, where inadequate ganglioside expression in mediobasal hypothalamic neurons deregulates neuronal leptin and insulin signaling.

In 1542, he would personally finish off Takato Yoritsugu at Ankokuji, shortly after the Siege of Fukuyo. In 1545, he successfully captured Takato castle. In 1546, he defeated Uesugi Norimasa at Usui Toge. With these victories, he was instrumental in gaining the control of Shinano Province and proved himself a skilled tactician. He was known as one of the \\"Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen\\".Inoue, Yasushi. (2006). The Samurai banner of Furin Kazan, p. 7. After these victories, Nobukata increasingly became selfish and started to hold victory ceremonies without firmly winning a battle. These victories rapidly became fewer. As Nobukata was the eldest of the Takeda retainers and having educated Shingen, few could criticize his actions. In 1547, Nobukata and his troops were almost completely wiped out in a battle against the Murakami clan and without a timely rescue by Hara Toratane, Nobukata himself would have been in danger as well. Shingen offered the following waka to Nobukata to encourage him to correct his act. :Dare mo Miyo Mitsureba Yagate Kaku Tsuki no Izayofu Ana ya Hito no Yo no Naka :Ë™∞„ÇÇ„Åø„Çà Ê∫Ä„Å§„Çå„Å∞„ÇÑ„Åå„Å¶ Ê¨†„ÅèÊúà„ÅÆ ÂçÅÂÖ≠Â§ú„ÅµÁ©¥„ÇÑ ‰∫∫„ÅÆ‰∏ñ„ÅÆ‰∏≠ :(Translation) \\"Everyone sees that even a beautiful full moon starts to change its shape, becoming smaller as the time passes.

Murakami's troop regrouped and counterattacked, killing Nobutaka and Amari Torayasu. The Meiji era politician Itagaki Taisuke was Nobukata's direct descendant, 12 generations removed. In fiction In NHK's 2007 Taiga drama F≈´rinkazan, Itagaki is played by Sonny Chiba.

Unlike full Cangjie, the user enters only the first and last keystrokes used in the Cangjie system, and then chooses the desired character from a list of candidate Chinese characters that pops up. This method is popular in Taiwan and Hong Kong, the latter in particular. Simplified Cangjie is one of the few input methods which has an IME pre- installed on Chinese-capable personal computers. Performance and learning Although described as having an easier learning curve with less errors, Simplified Cangjie users have slower typing speed compared to full Cangjie. The user must choose from a list of candidate characters, which can be compared to \\"hunt and peck\\" vs. ordinary touch typing. Because Simplified Cangjie does not promote the full sequence of keystrokes of standard Cangjie, it could leave simplified Cangjie users without knowledge of how to code a character without the disambiguation lists. Implementations =MS Windows= In Windows, Simplified Cangjie is called 'Quick'. Since Office 2007 and Windows 7, Microsoft offers two types of Quick: 'Quick' and 'New Quick'. Both are found under the section for Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan). The main difference between the two is that after the second keystroke, traditional Quick shows its drop down list while 'New Quick' will guess and output a character depending on the context (the New-Quick list needs to be manually invoked with an arrow key). 'New Quick' may also change previous characters of the sentence depending on whether the context changes. Microsoft also claims New-Quick to have an improved learning algorithm. Adoption =Hong Kong= In Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong, average computer users tend to prefer Simplified Cangjie over the full Cangjie largely due to its ease of use, and also the lack of other input methods available. The Cangjie IME itself has evidence of a strong presence in Hong Kong with it being available on most operating systems and keyboard layouts. As Hong Kong people are generally unfamiliar with phonetic-based input methods designed for Mandarin speakers such as pinyin and zhuyin, these methods are not widely used. Children in Hong Kong learn Chinese in a very different way from their peers in Mainland China and Taiwan, not only that they generally learn Chinese in Cantonese instead of Mandarin, but they do not learn any transliteration system until perhaps much later in their lives when they start learning Mandarin. Indeed, children in Hong Kong learn Chinese characters from the very beginning in kindergartens; in contrast, in mainland China and Taiwan, transliteration systems like pinyin or zhuyin are taught first before introducing any Chinese characters to children.

The show featured guests who played significant roles in world history. Guests would interact with each other and host Steve Allen, discussing philosophy, religion, history, science, and many other topics. Origin Steve Allen originally created the concept for Meeting of Minds in the late 1950s. He intended to broadcast it as a segment of his weekly The Steve Allen Show television program but the show's sponsor, The Chrysler Corporation, raised objections and the segment plans were cancelled. Five years later, however, Allen and an acting troupe finally performed the segment on Allen's nightly Westinghouse show. Then, in 1971, Allen attempted to revive the concept as part of a syndicated talk series. The first episode was a critical success, and the program won three local Emmy awards. Allen then personally financed the development of six additional one-hour programs, which were ultimately produced by PBS beginning in 1977. PBS series 1977‚Äì1981 The series was filmed at television station KCET in Hollywood, California. As nearly as was possible, the actual words of the historical figures were used. The show was fully scripted, yet the scripts were carefully crafted to give the appearance of spontaneous discussion among historic figures. Guests included: Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, Cleopatra, Marie Antoinette, Florence Nightingale, Thomas Paine, Francis Bacon, Thomas Jefferson, Voltaire, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Daniel O'Connell, Catherine II, and Oliver Cromwell.\\"Meeting of Minds,\\" full series Typically, each episode would be split into two parts, broadcast separately, with most or all of the guests introduced over the course of the first part, and the discussions continuing into the second part. A total of 24 episodes (or 12 two-part episodes) were produced. Actors made multiple appearances as different guests over the course of the series; this was particularly true of Allen's wife, Jayne Meadows, who appeared in 18 of the 24 episodes (playing nine distinct characters). There was also one major departure from the usual format, in which William Shakespeare was joined by several characters from his plays, with Meadows playing the role of the \\"dark lady\\" of his sonnets.

Because of their educational nature, Allen did not attach a royalty to such performances. Similar series The Canadian television series Witness to Yesterday, created by Arthur Voronka, aired three years after Allen's Emmy-award-winning local program. Unlike the Meeting of Minds round-table format, Witness to Yesterday employed a one-on-one interview format that focused on a single historical figure each episode. Steve Allen appeared on a 1976 episode of Witness to Yesterday as George Gershwin. Another Canadian TV series, Titans, followed a similar format. It was originally broadcast in 1981‚Äì82.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1994 to 2003 representing the ridings of Victoria‚ÄîHaliburton and Haliburton‚ÄîVictoria‚ÄîBrock. He was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. Background Hodgson was born in Haliburton, Ontario and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Trent University. He worked as a real-estate agent for RE/MAX and worked in health care planning for Haliburton County. Hodgson's son, Cody, is an ice hockey player picked 10th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft who currently plays for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League. His uncle, Ronald Glen Hodgson, was a Tory MPP for many years, in the same riding later held by Chris Hodgson. Another uncle, Louis Hodgson, was also a PC MPP, representing the Toronto riding of Scarborough East for one term from 1963 to 1967. Political career Hodgson was the warden of Haliburton County prior to entering provincial politics. Hodgson was elected to the Ontario legislature in a 1994 by-election, defeating Liberal candidate Sharon McCrae by fewer than 2,000 votes in the rural riding of Victoria‚ÄîHaliburton. The by-election was extremely bitter, and there were many accusations that Hodgson's team appealed to homophobic prejudice in the region to put their candidate over the top. At the time of the by-election, the Liberal Party supported the NDP government's plans to provide increased social benefits for same-sex couples in Bill 167. They reversed their position after Hodgson's victory, amid fears that the issue had cost them rural support. This reversal in policy would later cost the party, however: after targeting the Liberal Party's purported lack of credibility, the Tories won a majority government in the provincial election of 1995, and Hodgson was re-elected over McCrae by almost 20,000 votes. On June 26, 1995, he was named Minister of Natural Resources, Development and Mines in Mike Harris's government. On October 10, 1997, Hodgson was named Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet and Deputy Government House Leader. He also served as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. Hodgson defeated McCrae for a third time in the 1999 provincial election, this time in the redistributed riding of Haliburton‚ÄîVictoria‚ÄîBrock. He retained his position as Chair of the Management Board in the new parliament, and was also named Commissioner of the Board of Internal Economy on July 27, 1999. After a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, he was named Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. As Minister of Natural Resources Hodgson launched the Lands for Life initiative, which saw the largest increase in parks and protected space in the history of the province. As Municipal Affairs Minister he rewrote the Municipal Act for the first time since the passage of the Baldwin Act in the late 19th century, placed protective status on the Oak Ridges Moraine and began a smart growth program for the entire province, an initiative that was downsized to include only the GTA in the successive Liberal government and renamed Places to Grow. When Harris resigned as Premier in 2002, many expected Hodgson to enter the race to replace him. Instead, he endorsed Ernie Eves, the victorious candidate. He retained the Municipal Affairs and Housing portfolio in the Eves cabinet, but unexpectedly stepped down on January 13, 2003, announcing his decision to retire from politics. He did not run in the 2003 election. In 2004, he supported John Tory's successful bid to replace Eves as party leader. =Ipperwash Inquiry= Shortly after assuming office, Hodgson was involved in a cabinet discussion with Harris and members of the Ontario Provincial Police concerning a standoff with native protesters at Ipperwash Provincial Park. The police cleared the park by force on September 6, 1995, and in the process killed an unarmed protester named Dudley George. The Ipperwash Inquiry into the Ipperwash shooting was established by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty in 2004. In late 2005, former deputy Solicitor-General Elaine Todres testified that she heard Hodgson say, \\"Get the fucking Indians out of my park\\" at a lunch-hour meeting on the day of Dudley George's shooting. Former Attorney General Charles Harnick had previously testified that he heard Premier Harris say \\"I want the fucking Indians out of the park\\" at the same meeting. Harris and Hodgson both denied the allegations when they took the stand. =Cabinet positions= After politics He is currently president of the Ontario Mining Association.

Iran Newspaper He is arguably the most influential figure in the religious intellectual movement of Iran. Soroush is currently a visiting scholar at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD. He was also affiliated with other prestigious institutions, including Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, the Leiden-based International Institute as a visiting professorhttps://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-184.html for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin. He was named by TIME as one of the world‚Äôs 100 most influential people in 2005, and by Prospect magazine as one of the most influential intellectuals in the world in 2008.Library of Congress Soroush's ideas, founded on Relativism, prompted both supporters and critics to compare his role in reforming Islam to that of Martin Luther in reforming Christianity.Middle East Contemporary Survey ... - Google BooksAn introduction to Islam - Google Books Biography Abdolkarim Soroush was born in Tehran in 1945. Upon finishing high school, Soroush began studying pharmacy after passing the national entrance exams of Iran. After completing his degree, he soon left Iran for London in order to continue his studies and to become familiar with the Western world. It was after receiving a master's degree in analytical chemistry from University of London that he went to Chelsea College, (a constituent college of the University of London which was merged with two other constituent colleges: Queen Elizabeth College and Kings College in 1985) for studying history and philosophy of science. After the revolution, Soroush returned to Iran and there he published his book Knowledge and Value (Danesh va Arzesh), the writing of which he had completed in England. He then went to Tehran's Teacher Training College where he was appointed the director of the newly established Islamic Culture Group. While in Tehran, Soroush established studies in both history and the philosophy of science. A year later, all universities were shut down, and a new body was formed by the name of the Cultural Revolution Committee comprising seven members, including Abdulkarim Soroush, all of whom were appointed directly by Ayatollah Khomeini. Soroush's joining of the Cultural Revolution committee has been criticized on two sides. He has been accused by orthodox critics of preventing the Islamization of human sciences and by the opposition of the Islamic Republic regime of Iran to involvement in the dismissal of teachers. Soroush rejected the opposition accusation. There is not an independent historical research on Soroush's role in events which led to the Cultural Revolution and also his membership and his role in the Cultural Revolution committee. He has welcomed of such study in his interview with Professor Forough Jahanbakhsh - inquiring into modern Iranian intellectual history.Jahanbakhsh, Forough, Islam, Democracy and Religious Modernism in Iran, 1953-2000: From Bazargan to Soroush, Brill, 2001, p.145 In 1983, owing to certain differences which emerged between him and the management of the Teacher Training College, he secured a transfer to the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies where he has been serving as a research member of staff until today. He submitted his resignation from membership in the Cultural Revolution Council to Imam Khomeini and has since held no official position within the ruling system of Iran, except occasionally as an advisor to certain government bodies. His principal position has been that of a researcher in the Institute for Cultural Research and Studies. During the 90s, Soroush gradually became more critical of the political role played by the Iranian clergy. The monthly magazine that he cofounded, Kiyan, soon became the most visible forum in post-revolution Iran for religious intellectualism. In this magazine he published his most controversial articles on religious pluralism, hermeneutics, tolerance, clericalism, etc. The magazine was clamped down in 1998 among with many other magazines and newspapers by the direct order of the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic. About a thousand audio tapes of speeches by Soroush on various social, political, religious and literary subjects delivered all over the world are widely in circulation in Iran and elsewhere. Soon, he not only became subject to harassment and state censorship, but also lost his job and security. His public lectures at universities in Iran are often disrupted by hardline Ansar-e-Hizbullah vigilante groups who see his intellectual endeavours as being mainly motivated by anti-regime politics rather than theology per se. From the year 2000 Abdulkarim Soroush has been a visiting scholar at Harvard University teaching Rumi poetry and philosophy, Islam and Democracy, Quranic Studies and Philosophy of Islamic Law. Also a scholar in residence in Yale University, he taught Islamic Political Philosophy at Princeton University in the 2002-3 academic year. From 2003-4 he served as a visiting scholar at the Wissenschaftkolleg in Berlin. He spent the fall semester of 2007 at Columbia University and the spring semester of 2008 at Georgetown University's Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs as a visiting scholar. In the winter of 2012, he was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago teaching Intellectual and Religious History of Modern Iran.  Philosophy Soroush is primarily interested in the philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, the philosophical system of Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi (Rumi) and comparative philosophy. He is a world expert on Rumi and Persian Sufi poetry. The philosophy of Abdolkarim Soroush can be summarized as follows:Dr. Soroush *Distinction between \\"religion\\" and our \\"understanding of religion\\". *Distinction between \\"essential\\" and \\"accidental\\" aspects of religion. *Distinction between \\"minimalist\\" and \\"maximalist\\" interpretation of Islam. *Distinction between values and morals that are considered internal in respect to Islam and those that are external. *Distinction between Religious \\"belief\\" and Religious \\"faith\\". *Distinction between religion as an ideology/identity and religion of truth. =Distinction between \\"religion\\" and our \\"understanding of religion\\"= Soroush's main contribution to Islamic philosophy is that he maintains that one should distinguish between religious as divinely revealed and the interpretation of religion or religious knowledge which is based on socio-historical factors. At Oxford, Soroush was heavily influenced by Iranian philosopher Komeil Sadeghi, to whom he has dedicated one of his books Expansion of Prophetic Experience. Soroush's main thesis, entitled The Theoretical Contraction and Expansion of Shari'a separates religion per se from religious knowledge. The former, the essence of religion, is perceived as beyond human reach, eternal and divine. The latter, religious knowledge, is a sincere and authentic but finite, limited, and fallible form of human knowledge. =Religious \\"belief\\" and religious \\"faith\\"= Faith cannot be compulsory. As he told one interviewer, \\"True believers must embrace their faith of their own free will - not because it was imposed, or inherited, or part of the dominant local culture. To become a believer under pressure or coercion isn't true belief.\`\\"Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008, p.268 This also means that the believer \\"must ... remain free to leave his faith.\\"Islam and Liberal Democracy. Two Visions of Reformation, by Robin Wright, Journal of Democracy, 7.2 (1996) 64-75 = Soroush's political theory = Soroush's political theory is in line with the modern tradition from Locke to the framers of the American constitution. It portrays human beings as weak and susceptible to temptation, even predation. As such, they need a vigilant and transparent form of government. He believes that the assumption of innate goodness of mankind, shared by radical Utopians from anarchists to Islamic fundamentalists underestimates the staying power of social evil and discounts the necessity of a government of checks and balances to compensate for the weaknesses of human nature. Soroush's political philosophy, as well, remains close to the heart of the liberal tradition, ever championing the basic values of reason, liberty, freedom, and democracy. They are perceived as \\"primary values,\\" as independent virtues, not handmaidens of political maxims and religious dogma. Soroush entwines these basic values and beliefs in a rich tapestry of Islamic primary sources, literature, and poetry. = Religious democracy = Soroush introduced his own definition of the term Religious democracy which is now a topic in contemporary Iranian philosophy and means that the values of religion play a role in the public arena in a society populated by religious people. Religious democracy falls within the framework of modern rationality and has identifiable elements. It is in this way that we have a plurality of democracies in the international community. \\"Religious democracy\\" is a subject of intense research in Iranian intellectual circles. Democracy where coincides with certain things, it can be secular or religious. Hence, what alters the hue and color of democracy is a society‚Äôs specific characteristics and elements. Religious democracy is an example of how democratic values can exist in a different cultural elaboration than what is usually known before. But, in a secular society, some other characteristic is deemed important and focused on, and that becomes the basis for democracy. In fact relativistic liberalism and democracy are not identical since democracy is not violated when a faith is embraced, it is violated when a particular belief is imposed or disbelief is punished. We do not have one democracy but many democracies in history. We have a plurality of democracies in the international community. What emerged was that a democracy prevailed in different eras depending on the conditions of the time.  Holocaust denial  During a lecture at Stanford university he is quoted denying holocaust > ‚ÄúThink of the Holocaust; (pause) Supposedly, millions of Jews died; people > say, ‚Äòwhere was God?‚Äô‚Äù when asked what he meant by the word ‚Äúsupposedly.‚Äù His response was: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say 100,000, maybe one million.\\"https://www.maccabeetaskforce.org/in-denial- of-truth-stanford-guest-lecturer-abdolkarim-soroush-denies-millions-of-jewish- people-died-in-holocaust/https://stanfordreview.org/in-denial-of- truth/https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/02/08/sle-guest-lecturers-remarks- about-holocaust-spark-controversy/  Reception  In 2008, in an online open poll, Soroush was voted the 7th topmost intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by Prospect Magazine (UK) and Foreign Policy (United States). =Attacks= Soroush's ideas have met with strong opposition from conservative elements in the Islamic Republic. Both he and his audiences were assaulted by Ansar-e Hezbollah vigilantes in the mid-1990s. A law imposing penalties on anyone associating with enemies of the Islamic republic is thought by his allies to have been at least in part provoked by some of Soroush's lectures and foreign affiliations.The Last Great Revolution by Robin Wright c2000, p.57 According to the journalist Robin Wright: > Over the next year, he lost his three senior academic appointments, > including a deanship. Other public appearances, including his Thursday > lectures, were banned. He was forbidden to publish new articles. He was > summoned for several long \`interviews\` by Iranian intelligence officials. > His travel was restricted, then his passport confiscated. At the celebration of the sixteenth anniversary of the American embassy seizure in 1995, Wright found that Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \\"devoted more time berating Soroush...than condemning the United States or Israel.\\" Wright, Robin, Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East, Penguin Press, 2008, p.291-2  Research interests  *Persian literature *Philosophy of science *Iranian philosophy *Eastern philosophy *Theology *Islamic philosophy  Awards and honors  * 2004 Erasmus Prize * 2005 Time 100 most influential peopleThe 2005 TIME 100: Abdolkarim Soroush * 2008 Prospect magazine's 7 of 100 most influential intellectuals in the world.Intellectuals‚Äîthe results ¬´ Prospect Magazine * 2009 Foreign Policy magazine's 45 of 100 world's elite intellectuals * 2010 Foreign Policy magazine's 40 of 100 top global thinkersForeign Policy's Second Annual List of the 100 Top Global Thinkers  Foreign Policy Selected works * Dialectical Antagonism (in Persian), Tehran 1978 * Philosophy of History (in Persian), Tehran 1978 * What is Science, what is Philosophy (in Persian), 11th ed.

Biography Zhang joined the Communist Party of China in 1928 after taking part in a communist-led rural uprising. He participated in the Long March and served as a field commander in the Chinese Red Army, first fighting against Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang forces, and later the Imperial Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II Zhang commanded a guerrilla band sent to rescue U.S. flight crews who crash landed in China following the April 1942 Tokyo bombing raid led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle. After 1949, Zhang was an important builder of the Chinese military forces. He commanded the first People's Liberation Army naval force and served as an army corps commander in the Korean War. Upon his return home he served in a series of significant military and political posts. He was made a General in 1955. Zhang was accused of counterrevolutionary crimes and dismissed from all positions during the Cultural Revolution, when many veteran communists were attacked by Red Guards inspired by Mao Zedong's vision of continuous revolution, and one of his legs was broken as a result. Later, Zhang would comment: \\"The only thing the Cultural Revolution succeeded in was giving me a cane.\\" He reappeared in 1973 and served as defense minister from 1982 until 1988. He served as deputy chief of the PLA general staff, vice premier, and chaired a key commission that sought to modernize the PLA.

The AT-9 had a low-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, retractable landing gear and was powered by two Lycoming R-680-9 radial engines. Development Curtiss- Wright anticipated the requirement for this type of \\"high-performance\\" aircraft and designed the Curtiss-Wright CW-25, a twin-engined trainer, which possessed the takeoff and landing characteristics of a light bomber. Using the same basic design as the larger Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, the new CW-25 was designed to simulate the demands of multi-engined operations. The design featured a small layout, grouping two Lycoming R-680-9 radial engines forward and using a retractable tailwheel landing gear to achieve the performance necessary to meet the requirements of an advanced trainer. The single CW-25 prototype acquired for evaluation had a welded steel-tube fuselage structure with the wings, fuselage and tail unit fabric-covered.Mondey 2006, p.70.

The prototype CW-25 had a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage and fabric-covered wings and tail units, but production AT-9s were of stressed metal skin construction. The AT-9 was purposely designed to be less stable and proved to be difficult to fly or land, which made it particularly suitable for teaching new pilots to cope with the demanding flight characteristics of a new generation of high-performance, multi-engined aircraft such as the Martin B-26 Marauder and Lockheed P-38 Lightning. Comedian George Gobel was a trainer at Army air bases in Oklahoma for both the AT-9 and B-26. A total of 491 AT-9s were built before production ended and a new production run of 300 of the generally similar AT-9A commenced. Because of its difficult flying characteristics the AT-9 was not offered for sale to civilians after the war, although many non-flying examples were given to ground schools for training purposes.

It has one seat in the National Council, following the 2016 election. It has also representation at regional and local level. The OKS was founded in November 2001 as a parliamentary schism from the Democratic Party. The party has relied on electoral alliances with other centre-right parties, including the Sloboda a Solidarita (SaS), Most‚ÄìH√≠d and Conservative Democrats of Slovakia (KDS). The party won its best result, of 2.1%, in alliance with the KDS at the 2009 European election. The party won seats in the National Council for the first time in 2010 election, on the Most‚ÄìH√≠d list. In 2016 election the party won 1 seat in the National Council on the Sloboda a Solidarita list as well as in 2020 election when the party also won 1 seat on the Sloboda a Solidarita list. The OKS is a member of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe. History The Civic Conservative Party was formed by Democratic Party (DS) members of the National Council on 10 November 2001. The DS initially offered the OKS and the Liberal- Democratic Union to run in the 2002 election, on a united list, but then withdrew and endorsed the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union. The OKS attempted to negotiate a joint list with the Christian Democratic Movement and Party of the Hungarian Coalition, but this failed to materialise. Undeterred, the OKS ran alone under the banner 'Call for Slovakia' (V√Ωzva pre Slovensko) and gained 9,422 votes, or 0.32% of the national total. In the December 2002 local elections, two mayors were elected for OKS. In addition, OKS took 20 deputy seats, or 0.1% of the seats nationwide. In July 2003, it was one of four parties across Europe endorsing the soft eurosceptic Prague Appeal, along with the British Conservative Party, Law and Justice of Poland, and the Czech Civic Democrats. The OKS supported Franti≈°ek Miklo≈°ko of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) in the 2004 presidential election. Miklo≈°ko was one of the few candidates not being former members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and ended up fifth with 6.51% share of the total vote. In the European election two months later, the party fielded Peter Osusk√Ω as its sole candidate. He received 7,016 votes: 1% share of the vote. In the 2005 regional elections, the party gained three seats: Franti≈°ek ≈†ebej and Peter Tat√°r in Bratislava Region and Katar√≠na Adamicov√° in ≈Ωilina Region. This represented 0.72% share nationwide. OKS offered to run on the common candidate list with the Christian Democratic Movement in the 2006 parliamentary election. This offer was turned down by the KDH, the Civic Conservatives had to raise 500,000 kor√∫n as a fee for the party to participate. In March 2006, OKS member Ondrej Dost√°l applied to the Constitutional Court, considering the possible unconstitutionality of the election participation fee, saying the fee affects his right to run for office. In the election, former Chairman of the Czechoslovak Constitutional Court Ernest Valko and former Minister of Health Rudolf Zajac appeared on the OKS list. The party obtained 6,262 votes which represented 0.27% share of the total vote. In the 2009 regional elections, the OKS won four seats, up one from 2005: 3 in Bratislava Region and one in ≈Ωilina Region. =Parliamentary party= In the 2010 election, fourteen OKS members stood on the Most‚ÄìH√≠d party list. Strongly defining themselves as against the left-wing nationalist coalition, four MPs were elected from the list, along with ten Most‚ÄìH√≠d members. This gave the OKS its first parliamentary representation since 2002. Most‚ÄìH√≠d entered a centre-right coalition government, which the Civic Conservatives supported, but the OKS did not join the government themselves, and remained separate from Most‚ÄìH√≠d. In August, the party objected to coalition plans for tax reform, calling instead for closing tax loopholes and funding lower taxes by cutting government spending. In October 2010, Peter Zajac called for Dobroslav Trnka to step down as General Prosecutor, after Trnka criticised Interior Minister Daniel Lip≈°ic and other officials, saying that Trnka didn't respect the law or the human rights of ethnic Hungarians. The party supported changes to the controversial State Language Act, but the OKS's Ondrej Dost√°l said the changes didn't go far enough in allowing use of minority languages. In March 2011, the party opposed the government's plans to increase taxes on the self-employed, and instead proposed funding cuts in payroll tax by cutting government spending. The four OKS MPs have proposed a law restricting the government's power to build highways on privately owned land, which had earlier been ruled unconstitutional. In October 2011, the party opposed the government's commitment to the European Financial Stability Facility. In response, Franti≈°ek ≈†ebej left the OKS on 11 October and joined Most‚ÄìH√≠d. After the subsequent fall of the government, the OKS attempted to renew their alliance with Most‚ÄìH√≠d at the 2012 election, but were rejected. Instead, several OKS candidates were running on the Ordinary People list. However, they had left the list before the elections, in protest to the request of the leader of Ordinary People Igor Matoviƒç, that all candidates from the list undertake polygraph test. Ideology The party advocates respect for people regardless of their religion, race and nationality. Their aim is to pursue conservative values stemming from the inner need of individuals to live in a world whose highest value is personal freedom tempered by personal responsibility and an awareness of personal obligations towards society. The OKS characterizes itself as a party of reforms. According to its platform, it rejects: * all kinds of social engineering * totalitarianism and autocracy * historical, as well as current value relativism. It respects the historical memory as a part of the national cultural identity and thus rejects lining up behind autocracy, communism and fascism. The stated aim of the OKS is to pursue the system of European conservative values such as consistency, veracity, fairness, honesty, respectability, solidarity, and observance of written and non-written treaties and agreements. Elected representatives The OKS had three members of regional parliaments in 2009‚Äì2013: * Katar√≠na Adamicov√° (≈Ωilina) * Ren√© B√≠lik (Bratislava) * Ondrej Dost√°l (Bratislava) A fourth member of a regional parliament, Franti≈°ek ≈†ebej (Bratislava), left the party in 2011. In 2010‚Äì2012 OKS had four members of the National Council, embedded within the Most‚ÄìH√≠d party list of candidates: * Ondrej Dost√°l * Peter Osusk√Ω * Franti≈°ek ≈†ebej * Peter Zajac In 2012‚Äì2016 OKS did not have any Member of Parliament. Since the 2016 parliamentary elections OKS has one Member of the National Council. Ondrej Dost√°l, party leader, was elected on the party list of Sloboda a Solidarita (SaS).

In January 2018 Gr√≠msey had 61 inhabitants.STATISTICS ICELAND: Population by locality, age and sex 1 January 2011‚Äì2018, accessed 18 January 2019. Before 2009, Grimsey constituted the hreppur (municipality) of Gr√≠mseyjarhreppur. In that year, island residents voted to join the municipality with Akureyri.\\"Gr√≠msey og Akureyri sameinast\\"., Morgunbla√∞i√∞ 26 April 2009 The island's only settlement is Sandv√≠k. Geography Gr√≠msey is the northernmost inhabited Icelandic territory; the rapidly disappearing islet of Kolbeinsey lies some farther north, but is uninhabitable. The closest land is the island of Flatey, Skj√°lfandi, to the south. The Arctic Circle currently runs through the island, a feature of interest to many visitors, while the entirety of mainland Iceland lies south of the Arctic Circle. Due to long-term oscillations in the Earth's axis, the Arctic Circle currently shifts northward by about per year, though varying substantially from year to year due to the complexity of the movement. The true position of the Arctic Circle in the early 21st century is already close to the northern tip of the island, and by about the middle of the 21st century, it will no longer cross Grimsey at all. Originally a fixed monument to the Arctic Circle was placed at a conventional location. In 2017 a new monument, comprising an eight-tonne stone sphere, was placed close to the true current location of the circle, in response to its continual movement. Also, through the centuries three markers have been placed and marked with the calculated location: 1717, 1817, and 1917. There are steep cliffs everywhere except on the southern shoreline. Gr√≠msey has an area of , and a maximum elevation of . Climate Despite the northerly latitude, the climate is generally mild because of the North Atlantic Current, which brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico. The maximum daily mean temperature in any month falls short of 10¬∞C, so it is within a tundra (ET) climate. Biodiversity Though treeless, the island's vegetation cover is rich, consisting of marshland, grass, and moss, and the island is home to many birds, especially auks. accessed 1 Marcy 2015. Gulls and arctic terns also inhabit the island.John Schwartz, Why Are Puffins Vanishing? The Hunt for Clues Goes Deep (Into Their Burrows), New York Times (29 August 2018). Economy and society The principal industrial activity is commercial fishing. Agriculture and collecting seabird eggs are also common. Gr√≠msey is a popular tourist destination for visitors seeking an Arctic Circle experience. The island is served by regular ferry and aircraft passenger services from the mainland; there is a 3,400' north‚Äìsouth runway on the west side of the island.Grimsey - Google Maps (accessed 16 June 2019) The church on Gr√≠msey was built from driftwood in 1867 and renovated in 1956. It is part of the Akureyri parish. The island has a community center, and a school from kindergarten to Grade 8. Beyond this age, students travel to Akureyri for further education. The church was formerly a parsonage, and is situated at a place marked as Mi√∞gar√∞ur on most maps of the island; however, the single settlement is officially known as Sandv√≠k. The island has acquired a reputation for being a bastion of chess- playing. On learning this, the American scholar and keen chess player Willard Fiske took an interest in Gr√≠msey in the 1870s, sending supplies, supporting the economy and leaving money in his will, though he never visited the island. Transport The island is served by Gr√≠msey Airport. A ferry connects the island three days a week with the mainland.

The most famous of these effects is the application of a perspective effect on a background layer by scaling and rotating the background layer in this manner. This transforms the background layer into a two-dimensional horizontal texture-mapped plane that trades height for depth. Thus, an impression of three-dimensional graphics is achieved. Mode 7 was one of Nintendo's prominent selling points for the Super NES platform in publications such as Nintendo Power and Super NES Player's Guide. Similar faux 3D techniques have been presented on a few 2D systems other than the Super NES, in select peripherals and games. Use Mode 7 games include the titles * 7th Saga * The ActRaiser series * Aero the Acro-Bat * Ace o Nerae! * Accele Brid * Al Unser Jr.'s Road to the Top * Axelay * Bastard!! * Brett Hull Hockey 95 * Chrono Trigger * Demon's Crest * DinoCity * Exhaust Heat * F-Zero * Final Fantasy IV * Final Fantasy V * Final Fantasy VI * HyperZone * Illusion of Gaia * Jurassic Park * Kat's Run: Zen-Nippon K Car Senshuken * Kirby Super Star * Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals * MechWarrior * Mega Man 7 * Mohawk & Headphone Jack * NCAA Basketball * NHL Stanley Cup * Power Rangers Zeo: Battle Racers * Pilotwings * Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire * Run Saber * R-Type III: The Third Lightning * Rendering Ranger: R2 * Secret of Evermore * Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana * Skyblazer * SOS * Star Ocean * Street Racer * Super Castlevania IV * Super Aleste * Super Mario Kart * Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars * Super Mario World and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island * Super Metroid * The Super Robot Wars series * Super Scope 6 * The Super Star Wars series * Super Tennis * The Super Turrican series * Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time * Terranigma * The Brainies * Zoku: The Legend of Bishin * The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past * Wing Commander * Wolfenstein 3D * Yoshi's Safari The visual effects were later reimplemented by other means in the Game Boy Advance incarnations of many of these games. Function The Super NES console has eight graphics modes, numbered from 0 to 7, for displaying background layers. The last one (background mode 7) has a single layer that can be scaled and rotated. This graphical method is suited to racing games, and is used extensively for the overworld sections of role- playing games such as Square's popular 1994 game Final Fantasy VI. The effect enables developers to create the impression of sprawling worlds that continue toward the horizon. A particular utilization technique with Mode 7 allows pixels of the background layer to be in front of sprites. Examples include the second and fifth stage of Contra III: The Alien Wars, the second and fifth stage of Jim Power: The Lost Dimension in 3-D, the introduction screen of Tiny Toon Adventures: Buster Busts Loose, when a player falls off the stage in Super Mario Kart, some cinematics in Super Metroid, and in some boss battles in Super Mario World. =Formula= Mode 7 graphics are generated for each pixel by mapping screen coordinate \\\\mathbf{r} to background coordinate \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\prime using an affine transformation and sampling the corresponding background color. The 2D affine transformation is specified for each scanline by 6 parameters; a , b , c , and d define the matrix \\\\mathbf{M} , while x_0 and y_0 define the vector \\\\mathbf{r}_0 locates the origin of the matrix transformation and is related to a translation vector. Specifically, screen coordinate \\\\mathbf{r} is translated to the origin coordinate system, the matrix is applied, and the result is translated back to the original coordinate system to obtain \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\prime . In 2D matrix notation, this is written as \\\\mathbf{r}^\\\\prime = \\\\mathbf{M} (\\\\mathbf{r} - \\\\mathbf{r}_0) + \\\\mathbf{r}_0 \\\\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\\\\\\\\\ y' \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\- \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_0 \\\\end{bmatrix} . All arithmetic is carried out on 16-bit signed fixed point numbers, while all offsets are limited to 13 bits. The radix point is between bits 7 and 8. Two- dimensional affine transformations can produce any combination of translation, scaling, reflection, rotation, and shearing‚Äîand nothing else. However, many games create additional effects by setting a different transformation matrix for each scanline. In this way, pseudo-perspective, curved surface, and distortion effects can be achieved. Limits Mode 7 can only work on backgrounds, not sprites; therefore, any object that does not rotate or scale with the background must be a sprite, even items that would normally be thought of as part of the background, such as fixed platforms. The game developer must create a sprite with the same appearance as that object. For instance, in Super Castlevania IV, battles in which a large boss such as Koranot rotates have the mobile boss implemented as the background, while the blocks on which the protagonist stands are sprites. With the obvious enhancements, this is similar to how some NES games feature battles against a giant movable boss without the slowdown and flicker inherent in a large sprite set‚Äîby making the boss the background, and then moving and animating it. Both systems' examples can only apply to objects in the horizontal plane of the moving object. For instance, a floor, ceiling, or scoreboard can remain part of a background in both the NES and SNES examples as long as they are completely \\"above\\" or \\"below\\" the field of gameplay. They can also be turned into sprites if the whole screen is needed, but this can cause slowdown. The fact that Mode 7 cannot be used on sprites means that each \\"size\\" of an \\"approaching\\" sprite for a given distance has to be pre-drawn, meaning that one would see sprites \\"jump\\" between a limited number of sizes when \\"approaching\\" them. This can be seen in Super Mario Kart and HyperZone whenever an object approaches, or when walking vertically on the Final Fantasy VI map with an airship in view. Similarly, the appearance of sprite rotations must be handled through pre-drawing unless they are done with hardware included in the game cartridge such as the Super FX 2 chip, as with Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. A notable workaround does exist and can be seen in Contra III: The Alien Wars in the second boss battle, and in Super Mario World in the battles against Reznor (platform wall support), Iggy (battle platform), Larry (also the platform), Morton, Ludwig, Roy, and Bowser. In these examples, the boss is a \\"background\\" and therefore rotates through Mode 7, and the scoreboard, which is \\"above\\" the field of play, is also a background, but the floor of battle's cracks are, as with the players and gunfire, \\"sprites\\" that are redrawn under various rotations as the player rotates. However, this only allows one \\"sprite\\" to be manipulated at once. One exception to Mode 7-like effects on sprites handled neither by pre-drawing nor by external chips occurs in Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean, where re- rendering of sprites on the fly is done entirely by the software. In Tales of Phantasia, the player sprite vertically stretches upon walking onto a save spot, and in Star Ocean, items are squashed when popping out of an open treasure chest. Due to the extra tiles needed for such rendering and the other high system demands throughout those games (both using a form of streaming audio to circumvent the SPC700's limited capacity, and as with most high-end SNES RPGs, using a variable width font), such rendering was limited to those few scenes. The Mega Drive/Genesis has no hardware-native feature comparable to Mode 7, though the Mega CD/Sega CD and 32X peripherals add such a feature. However, as in Tales of Phantasia and Star Oceans sprite effect add-ins, some comparable technical feats were programmed entirely in software, seen in games such as Dick Vitale's \\"Awesome Baby\\" College Hoops and Zero Tolerance. Although there is no hardware-native feature comparable to Mode 7 in the Amiga, some of its games use programming tricks that resemble the effects of Mode 7‚Äîfor example in Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad, Lionheart, Obitus, and Brian the Lion. Hardware The two PPU (picture-processing unit) chips of the SNES use two 8-bit 32-kilobyte RAM chips. One PPU can access the tile map (128√ó128 tiles), and the other PPU can access the tile set (256 tiles, 8√ó8 pixels in 256 colors) in a single cycle.

Yosef Mendelevitch (or Mendelovitch) (b. 1947 in Riga), was a refusenik from the former Soviet Union, also known as a \\"Prisoner of Zion\\" and now a politically unaffiliated rabbi living in Jerusalem who gained fame for his adherence to Judaism and public attempts to emigrate to Israel at a time when it was against the law in the USSR. Biography Mendelevich was born in Riga and started his Jewish activities in the 1960s. He formed a student group of underground Jewish Education in 1966 and became an editor of an underground newsletter Iton on Jewish issues in 1969. Being repeatably refused the right to immigration, he became one of the leaders of the Dymshits‚ÄìKuznetsov hijacking affair, recounted in his 2012 memoir, Unbroken Spirit. As punishment, he was imprisoned for eleven years. During the imprisonment he was punished for keeping Jewish precepts. In 1981, after a worldwide struggle, he was released and immigrated to Israel. He served in Soviet prisons with famous Jewish dissident Natan Sharansky (amongst others). In Sharansky's memoir Fear No Evil he describes innovative ways Mendelevitch used to communicate with Sharansky, such as through both toilet bowls and radiators. Mendelevitch had always exhibited leadership qualities. Early on in Israel he headed an organization called Soviet Jewry Information Center and has managed to attract followers to his causes. This has been attested to by his fellow refuseniks, such as Natan Sharansky: \\"In May 1988 he [Sharansky] founded the Zionist Forum, in preparation for the future waves of Aliyah from the Soviet Union, and based its activity on the database formed by former Refusenik Yosef Mendelevitch.\\" He was known as a \\"Prisoner of Zion.\\" Since moving to Israel he adopted Orthodox Judaism and has become a rabbi affiliated with the Religious Zionist movement. He studied at Yeshivat Mercaz HaRav and was ordained as a rabbi by Rabbi Avraham Shapira and Rabbi She'ar Yashuv Cohen. Mendelevitch has been a political activist from his days in the former USSR. When he moved to Israel, he became a globetrotting speaker on behalf of various causes, such as lobbying for the release of convicted spy Jonathan Pollard in the USA. In his autobiography, written in Hebrew, ◊û◊ë◊¶◊¢ ◊ó◊™◊ï◊†◊î ◊ê◊°◊ô◊® ◊¶◊ô◊ï◊ü he describes his struggle as a \\"Prisoner of Zion.\\" Mendelevitch has become a popular speaker in various Jewish communities and has spoken out on controversial issues relating to Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has constantly involved himself in political and international affairs, Russia's support for Arab states, and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, such as when he spoke out against a 1991 state visit by Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh's visit to Israel: :\\"Jews who spent years in Soviet prisons were far less enthusiastic than most Israelis about Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh's historic visit here Friday. ... 'It's nothing but a bad dream,' said Yosef Mendelevitch, another former Soviet prisoner, commenting on Bessmertnykh's visit, the first by a Soviet foreign minister to Israel. Mendelevitch spent about a decade in Soviet prisons on charges of attempting to hijack an airplane to Israel. He was freed and permitted to emigrate in 1981. He told Israel radio that he still distrusts the Soviets because of Moscow's alliance with Arab states. 'We should remember that a lot of the blood spilled here in the last 40 years was with Soviet weapons,' he added. Sharansky and Mendelevitch also criticized the Soviet leader for hinting Thursday in Amman that the tide of Soviet immigrants to Israel could be halted unless Israel stops building Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.\\" There have been many articles, books and documentaries about his life.

Alexander Collie & Co. of Manchester acquired her for their blockade-running fleet, but were persuaded by renowned blockade-runner Lieutenant John Wilkinson (CSN) to sell her to the Confederate States Navy for the same ¬£32,000 just paid. Her first voyage was into Old Inlet, Wilmington, North Carolina in January 1863 with valuable munitions and 26 Scottish lithographers, eagerly awaited by the Confederate Government bureau of engraving and printing. On January 26, Union intelligence maintained she \\"could be captured easily\\" at anchor in Ossabaw Sound, but this was not to be for another 10 months. Running out again, Robert E. Lee started to establish a near-legendary reputation for blockade running by leaving astern blockader . Lieutenant Richard H. Gayle, CSN, assumed command in May 1863, relieving Lieutenant John Wilkinson; but Wilkinson was conning the ship again out of the Cape Fear River from Smithville, North Carolina on October 7, 1863, as recounted by Lieutenant Robert D. Minor, CSN, in a letter to Admiral Franklin Buchanan dated February 2, 1864, detailing the first venture to capture and liberate 2,000 Confederate prisoners at Johnson's Island, Sandusky, Ohio. Robert E. Lee transported Wilkinson, Minor, Lieutenant Benjamin P. Loyall and 19 other naval officers to Halifax, Nova Scotia with $35,000 in gold and a cotton cargo \\"subsequently sold at Halifax for $76,000 (gold) by the War Department ‚Äî in all some $111,000 in gold, as the sinews of the expedition.\\" Thus Wilkinson was in Canada and Gayle commanding when Robert E. Lee's luck ran out on November 9, 1863, after 21 voyages in 10 months carrying out over 7,000 bales of cotton, returning with munitions invaluable to the Confederacy. She left Bermuda five hours after her consort, CSS Cornubia, only to be run down a few hours after her by the same blockader, . The two runners were conceded to be easily \\"the most noted that ply between Bermuda and Wilmington.\\" This ship was not the one immortalised in the American popular song Waiting for the Robert E.

Lee was condemned as a prize at Boston, Massachusetts, acquired by the United States Navy and placed in commission on June 29, 1864 as USS Fort Donelson, with Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Thomas Pickering in command. Fort Donelson was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, cruising in blockade of the North Carolina coast through the remainder of 1864 with brief periods of repair at Norfolk, Virginia. From January 13 to January 22, 1865 she aided in the bombardment of Fort Fisher's batteries and landed ammunition supplies for the Union forces. Fort Donelson joined the fleet in attacking Fort Anderson on February 17-February 18.

Romero's 1968 horror film of the same name. Romero rewrote the original 1968 screenplay he had originally co-authored with John A. Russo.  Plot  Siblings Barbara and Johnny visit their father's grave in a remote Pennsylvania cemetery. Johnny continuously scares Barbara with zombie antics, and mocking the fact that their mother could be one of them. During their visit, they notice an old man with a bite on his forehead walking around them. As Johnny and Barbara talk about it, she is attacked by a zombie. Her brother attempts to fight off the zombie, but is killed after he falls and cracks his head on a tombstone. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what appears to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows. They discover other survivors hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a selfish and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; and teenage lovers Tom Bitner and Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, while the other survivors go upstairs to continue reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts a large mob of zombies to the farmhouse. The group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a few hundred yards away. A search of the corpse who lived in the farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to the gas pump is not among the set they brought with them. When Tom shoots the lock off, the gasoline gushing forth is ignited by a burning piece of wood in the truck. The resulting explosion kills both Tom and Judy. Ben returns to the house to find things beginning to dissolve into chaos. Harry has wrestled Barbara's gun away from her and is now armed. Unknown to the survivors upstairs, the Coopers' daughter Sarah has succumbed to the bite on her arm and has transformed into a zombie; she attacks and bites her distraught mother, who does not defend herself. When Sarah makes her way upstairs, she triggers a shootout between her father, who is trying to protect her, and Ben and Barbara, who are trying to protect themselves. Both Ben and Harry are badly wounded; Barbara shoots Sarah. Harry retreats upstairs to the attic, while Ben makes his way to the cellar, where he shoots a reanimated Helen. Ben gradually goes into shock, and after realizing the gas key has been in the cellar the entire time, he laughs mindlessly at the irony. Meanwhile, Barbara leaves the house alone and attempts to find help. She eventually joins a group of countryside locals who are clearing the area of the undead, and awakens the next day surrounded by the safety of the media and townspeople, led by Sheriff McClelland. Noticing hillbillies playing around with a few zombies, she comments on the similarities between the living and the undead. She returns to the farmhouse to find Ben, who died of his wounds and has been reanimated; he gazes at Barbara before being shot by McClelland. When Harry emerges from the attic alive, Barbara kills him in a fit of rage for causing Ben's death, and turns to leave the house, telling the vigilantes they have \\"another one for the fire\\". The film ends as Barbara watches the bodies being burned on a pyre.  Cast   Production  Romero said that the remake came about in part because of issues over profits of the original film. A lengthy court battle over the rights to the film, plus an oversight that caused the copyright notice not to be included, caused Romero to see little in the way of profit. Romero's production company, Image Ten, eventually won the lawsuit, but the distributor went out of business before they could collect any money. Another issue was the fact that the filmmakers were worried that someone else might make an unauthorized remake. Romero contacted Menahem Golan when he heard that 21st Century Film Corporation was interested in a remake, and Romero, Russo, and Streiner collaborated for the first time in 20 years. Savini was initially hired to perform the special effects, but was persuaded to direct by Romero. Savini was drawn to the remake because he was unavailable to do special effects on the original. The special effects team intentionally kept the effects restrained, as they felt that excessive gore would be disrespectful to the original film. To keep the effects realistic, they used as inspiration a real autopsy, forensic pathology textbooks, and Nazi death camp footage. Savini said that he wanted to keep the film artistic despite his reputation as \\"the king of splatter\\". The zombie extras were recruited easily, as the film's reputation drew them from as far away as Kentucky. The production was not easy for Savini, who described it as \\"the worst nightmare of my life\\". Savini said that only 40% of his ideas made it into the final film. Without Romero on set, he clashed with the producers, who did not allow him to explore his vision for the film.  Release  To avoid an NC-17 rating, Savini had to cut several scenes from the film. Savini attributed the film's lack of popularity among horror fans to these cuts. A Blu-ray version was released in a limited edition of 3,000 on October 9, 2012 by Twilight Time. Australian film distributor Umbrella Entertainment released a special edition of the film featuring a restored print, alongside the 1968 original on Blu-ray on April 6, 2016.  Reception  Initial response to the remake was negative. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert awarded the film one star out of a possible four, writing, \\"The remake is so close to the original that there is no reason to see both\\". Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, \\"There was no real need to remake a film that lives on the campy cult appeal it has acquired over time. But as B-movies and remakes go, this one knows how to bring tired zombies back to life.\\" Variety called it \\"a crass bit of cinematic grave- robbing\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it D‚Äì and wrote, \\"In the history of bad ideas, George Romero's decision to produce a color remake of his disturbingly frenzied 1968 zombiefest Night of the Living Dead has to rank right up there with New Coke.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"While this Night hasn't the chilling, almost cinema-verite credibility of the original, it is certainly a well-sustained entertainment\\". In The Washington Post, Richard Harrington criticized the film as a purely financial effort that lacks the shock of the original film now that zombie film tropes have become clich√©d. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune rated it three out of four stars and wrote that although Savini's direction is a bit too literal, the film \\"contains some intriguing further development of the ideas of the first film, as well as some mistakes corrected and dramatic relationships tightened.\\" Modern criticism has been more appreciative. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 66% based on reviews from 32 critics, with an average rating of 6.23/10. On Metacritic it has a score of 58 out of 100 based on reviews from Bloody Disgusting rated it four-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote, \\"This film works on so many levels. Normally, remakes are horrible, and diverge so much from the original film. This one is so close to the original it's scary.\\" Reviewing the Twilight Time Blu-ray, Adam Tyner of DVD Talk rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"We'll never get a chance to see the remake that Tom Savini set out to direct. Still, despite the many missteps of this severely compromised version, Night of the Living Dead manages to distinguish itself as one of the more effective horror remakes out there.\\" Reviewing the same disc at DVD Verdict, Patrick Naugle rated it 83 out of 100 and called it \\"one of the superior zombies movies available\\". In a retrospective at PopMatters, academic Cynthia Freeland compared the racial politics of the original film and the gender politics of the remake. Freeland concludes that the original film's depiction of Barbara makes for better cinema, and the more feminist-friendly update of Barbara is too derivative of standard \\"final girl\\" tropes.

The drying of food is the world's oldest known preservation method, and dried fish has a storage life of several years. The method is cheap and effective in suitable climates; the work can be done by the fisherman and family, and the resulting product is easily transported to market. Cod is the most common fish used in stockfish production, while other whitefish, such as pollock, haddock, ling and cusk, are used to a lesser degree. Over the centuries, several variants of dried fish have evolved. The stockfish (fresh dried, not salted) category is often mistaken for the clipfish, or salted cod, category where the fish is salted before drying. After 2‚Äì3 weeks in salt the fish has salt-matured, and is transformed from wet salted fish to clipfish through a drying process. The salted fish was earlier dried on rocks (clips) on the foreshore. The production method of clipfish was developed by the Portuguese who first mined salt near the brackish water of Aveiro, and brought it to Newfoundland where cod () was available in massive quantities. Salting was not economically feasible until the 17th century, when cheap salt from southern Europe became available to the maritime nations of northern Europe. Stockfish is cured in a process called fermentation where cold-adapted bacteria matures the fish, similar to the maturing process of cheese. Clipfish is processed in a chemical curing process called salt- maturing, similar to the maturing processes of other salt-matured products like Parma ham. Etymology Stockfish warehouse in the village of Fors√∏l, Norway The word stockfish is a loan word from West Frisian stokfisk (stick fish), possibly referring to the wooden racks on which stockfish are traditionally dried or because the dried fish resembles a stick.Kurlansky, chapter 3; cf. OED s.v. 'stockfish': \\"the reason for the designation is variously conjectured\\" \\"Stock\\" may also refer to a wooden yoke or harness on a horse or mule, once used to carry large fish from the sea or after drying/smoking for trade in nearby villages. This etymology is consistent with the fact that \\"Stockma√ü\\" is German for the height of a horse at the withers. \\"Stockfish\\" and \\"Stockma√ü\\" therefore refer essentially to the same basic length. Importance Stockfish is Norway's longest sustained export commodity. Stockfish is first mentioned as a commodity in the 13th-century Icelandic prose work Egil's Saga, where chieftain Thorolf Kveldulfsson, in the year 875 AD, ships stockfish from Helgeland in mid-Norway to Britain. This product accounted for most of Norway's trade income from the Viking Age throughout the Medieval period. Preserved cod fed Iceland for centuries, to the extent where it has been described as a local equivalent of bread.Kurlansky, chapter 9 Stockfish is extremely popular and is widely consumed in Catholic Mediterranean countries, mostly in Portugal and secondly also in Italy. (Stockfish is called stoccafisso in most Italian dialects, but confusingly baccal√†‚Äîwhich normally refers to salt cod‚Äîin the Veneto).La differenza tra stoccafisso e baccal√† In Russian cuisine dried stockfish is a very popular dish which is often eaten with vodka and beer. In 16th century Russian and Swedish stockfish were sold to many European countries. Stockfish is a staple of Nigerian cuisine. Manufacturing and usage Stockfish from cod in Venice, Italy The science of producing good stockfish is in many ways comparable to that of making a good cognac, Parma ham, or a well-matured cheese. Practitioners of the Slow Food movement insist that all these artisanal products must be made on a small scale and given time to mature. The fish is prepared immediately after capture. After gutting the fish, it is either dried whole, or split along the spine leaving the tail connected. The fish is hung on the hjell from February to May. Stable cool weather protects the fish from insects and prevents an uncontrolled bacterial growth. A temperature just above zero degrees Celsius, with little rain, is ideal. Too much frost will spoil the fish, as ice destroys the fibers in the fish. The climate in northern Norway is excellent for stockfish production. Due to the stable conditions, the stockfish produced in Lofoten and Vester√•len is often regarded as the best. The traditional cod harvest in Lofoten also takes place during the best drying time. Due to a milder and more humid climate, salted/dried whitefish (klippfisk) was more common in the fisheries districts of Western Norway. After its three months hanging on the hjell, the fish is then matured for another two to three months indoors in a dry and airy environment. During the drying, about 80% of the water in the fish evaporates.Kurlansky, chapter 2 The stockfish retains all the nutrients from the fresh fish, only concentrated: it is therefore rich in proteins, vitamins, iron, and calcium. After sorting by quality, most of the stockfish is exported to Italy, Croatia and Nigeria.Frederick Forsyth, who covered the 1967-1969 Nigerian Civil War as a reporter, noted that dried fish imports from Norway were a key source of protein for the nation. Forsyth, Frederick. The Outsider: My Life in Intrigue. NY: Putnam, p. 176 In Norway and Iceland, the stockfish is mostly used as a snack and for lutefisk production. In Italy, the fish (called stoccafisso) is soaked and used in various courses, and is viewed as a delicacy. Low-quality stockfish is also commonly used as supplemental food for pets, primarily as dog food or dog treats. The 2012‚Äì2015 project SafeTrackFood developed a method of indoor production of stockfish to accelerate the maturing and drying of the fish in a safe manner. Dishes The baccal√† alla lucana: traditional recipe from Basilicata Surinamese \\"broodje bakeljauw\\" in the Netherlands (a bun with sliced cucumbers and shredded and spiced stockfish) The baccal√† alla vicentina, an ancient and traditional Italian dish native to Vicenza, is made from stockfish (confusingly from dried and salted cod, although this is known in standard Italian as baccal√†) and is served on or next to polenta. In the Italian region of Basilicata, the so- called baccal√† alla lucana is prepared with typical peppers called \\"cruschi\\" (dialect word for \\"crispy\\"). Dishes made from stockfish (locally called bakalar) are traditionally eaten on Christmas Eve in Croatia, especially Dalmatia. Stockfish is popular in West Africa, where it is used in the many soups that complement the grain staples fufu and garri. In the Southwestern part of Nigeria among the Yoruba, it is called panla. Also the main ingredient in the Igbo snack called \\"Ugba na Okporoko\\" or \\"ukazi\\" amongst the Ohafia people in Abia state in Nigeria. Indeed, in Abia stockfish is quite popular and a regular ingredient used in many local delicacies. Most importers of \\"okporoko\\" are based in the town of Aba in Abia State. Among the Umuahia people, at festive periods, the best staple is the Ukazi soup which must necessarily be very well garnished with okporoko or Cod as it is popularly called. The Kwe people, who are a fishing people of the English-speaking part of Cameroon, use stockfish in flavoring their palm nut or banga, which can be eaten with a cocoyam pudding called kwacoco. The name okporoko for stockfish, among the Igbo of Nigeria refers to the sound the hard fish makes in the pot and literally translates as \\"that which produces sound in the pot\\". Both stockfish and salt cod can be made into lutefisk. Stockfish is typically sold in whole bales (100 lbs per bale) or half-a-bale, one-quarter bale or even one-tenth-bale.

It won the Special Jury Prize at the Cognac Festival. Plot On Monday night, Nick, Dallas, and Billy Hill argue with a Los Angeles convenience store cashier. Dallas shoots her dead. They conceal the killing from a police officer until he sees blood on the floor. Early Thursday morning, Casey in Texas receives a call from his old drug dealing partner Nick asking to stay a couple of days. Since they split some years ago Casey has cleaned up, married, and is hoping to adopt a child. Nick borrows Casey's car, and Casey finds Nick's suitcase to be full of heroin. Furious, he calls Nick with an ultimatum or he calls the cops, but Nick says he'll be along once he has finished some business. Casey puts the heroin down the garbage grinder. At 11:55, Casey answers the door to hitman Ice. Casey asks that they smoke some ganja together before he dies, then takes advantage of a distraction. Ice ends up gagged and bound in Casey's garage just as Dr. Jarvis, the adoption agent, rings the doorbell. Casey, stoned, rushes to clear away the drug paraphernalia before letting Jarvis in to discuss his suitability to adopt. Dr. Jarvis is particularly curious to know what Casey did for several years when he lived in L.A., as there is no account of his time there. Casey tries his best to cover up his past as well as his recent encounter with the hitman. During the interview, Dallas, who wants the money that she believes Nick left with Casey along with the heroin, shows up. She scares Dr. Jarvis away by telling a story about Casey's drug-dealing and murdering past. When left alone with Casey, Dallas questions him about the money's whereabouts. Angry that he cannot help her, she decides to kill him, but not before she ties him to a chair, fellates him to force an erection, strips naked, and proceeds to mount and rape him. She tells him she will not kill him until he orgasms and she plans to go on until she makes him do so. Delivering on her word, she reaches multiple orgasms, but gets no results from him. While Dallas reaches a third orgasm, Billy breaks in and shoots her, splattering her blood all over Casey, his walls, and his floor. Billy believes Casey when told that he does not have the heroin, but plans on torturing him with a saw and a blow torch anyway, while he brags about his prowess and technique of cauterization as he sets to work. Billy is interrupted by cops raiding the house next door. As Billy checks on it Casey is able to loosen the tape around his wrists and grabs a frying pan and sits back down. Billy returns and tells Casey the cops got the wrong house. As he is about to proceed, he notices something is wrong, but Casey catches him off guard, overpowers him, and leaves him in the garage. Nick calls Casey from a pay phone, apologizes for everything, and admits he had stolen the heroin and money from the police. After he hangs up, it is revealed that Nick has been shot and is bleeding severely, about to die. Finally, corrupt cop Kasarov arrives with a bag which contains Nick's head. He gives Casey until 7 p.m. to find the money, but says that he does not care about the heroin. Kasarov then sees the garage with Ice and Billy tied up and Dallas dead and unloads a magazine into Ice and Billy. He tells Casey to throw them out, as it is garbage day. In the end, Casey calls Ice's boss and tells him that the heroin is being auctioned off at 7 p.m. at his house, setting up a gun battle between the Jamaicans and the corrupt officers. He recalls Nick's earlier words, which lead him to find the money and a wedding present in the spare tire of his car. He takes them, puts them in Dallas's Lamborghini Diablo car, and leaves to pick his wife up at the airport.

The name \\"hopcalite\\" is derived from Johns Hopkins University - \\"Hop\\" and the University of California - \\"Cal\\", where basic research into carbon monoxide was carried out during the First World War and these catalysts were discovered in 1918. A variety of compositions are known, such as \\"hopcalite II\\" that is approximately 60% manganese dioxide and 40% copper oxide (the MnO2 : CuO molar ratio is 1.375) and \\"hopcalite I\\" that is a mixture of 50% MnO, 30% CuO, 15% Co2O3, and 5% Ag2O. Hopcalite has the properties of a porous mass and resembles activated carbon in its appearance.  Preparation  While typically hopcalite catalysts are prepared by calcinating intimate mixtures of oxides and carbonates, various techniques have been employed for producing hopcalites in the laboratory and on an industrial scale, such as physical mixing of the (finely divided) metal oxides, co-precipitation of the metal oxides from metal salt solutions (see salts), thermal decomposition of mixtures of metal nitrates (see nitrate) and metal carbonates (see carbonate), one-step synthesis via flame spray pyrolysis from organic and inorganic precursor systems, e.g. Nanophase hopcalite catalysts have also been described. Although hopcalite-based catalysts have been used in practice for decades, many questions regarding their mode of action are still open. This is due to their complex structures, which make it difficult to obtain information about the active centers and the mechanisms of catalysis and deactivation.  Applications  Hopcalite is widely used in personal respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and collective protective equipment, among others. Different uses of hopcalite catalysts are listed below: * in some types of gas mask filters designed to protect from carbon monoxide (Soviet-made DP-1, combined filters VK-450, SX (CO) filters, e.g.) * in air filtration systems and breathing apparatus to purify breathing air supplies, for example those utilised in scuba diving, and firefighting. * used as the main filtration ingredient in the self rescue respirators issued to miners (SPP-4) * filtering self-rescuers designed for use in fire conditions (GDZK-EN, GDZK-U, GDZK-A, e.g.) * in devices for monitoring the content of carbon monoxide (CO) in rooms * used as a precaution with submersible air compressors, if they are driven by internal combustion engines (like on ships) In respiratory protective equipment, hopcalite is used to facilitate the rapid oxidation of the toxic carbon monoxide to harmles carbon dioxide with the oxygen from the air, which is then chemically bound to a sodium hydroxide layer, thus eliminating CO from the air stream, (which otherwise is not removed by activated charcoal air filters). Water vapor poisons the hopcalite catalyst, so in order to protect against water vapor, an additional filter based on Silica gel is introduced. In addition to that, the hopcalite layer is protected by a mechanical filter and a layer of activated carbon, purify the air of other contaminants. The operation of carbon monoxide (CO) detectors, on the other hand, is based on recording the heat released during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO2). Although primarily used to catalyze the conversion of CO to CO2, hopcalite catalysts are also used to remove ethylene oxide and other VOCs as well as ozone from gas streams. In addition, hopcalites catalyze the oxidation of various organic compounds at elevated temperatures (200‚Äì500¬∞ C).

It includes true hamsters, voles, lemmings, and New World rats and mice. At almost 608 species, it is the second-largest family of mammals, and has members throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.  Characteristics  The cricetids are small mammals, ranging from just in length and in weight in the New World pygmy mouse up to and in the muskrat. The length of their tails varies greatly in relation to their bodies, and they may be either furred or sparsely haired. The fur of most species is brownish in colour, often with a white underbelly, but many other patterns exist, especially in the cricetine and arvicoline subfamilies. Like the Old World mice, cricetids are adapted to a wide range of habitats, from the high Arctic to tropical rainforests and hot deserts. Some are arboreal, with long balancing tails and other adaptations for climbing, while others are semiaquatic, with webbed feet and small external ears. Yet others are burrowing animals, or ground-dwellers.Eisenberg et al. (1984) Their diets are similarly variable, with herbivorous, omnivorous, and insectivorous species all being known. They all have large, gnawing, incisors separated from grinding molar teeth by a gap, or diastema. Although a few exceptions occur, the dental formula for the great majority of cricetids is: Cricetids' populations can increase rapidly in times of plenty, due to a combination of short gestation periods between 15 and 50 days, and large litter sizes relative to many other mammals. The young are typically born blind, hairless, and helpless.  Evolution and systematics  Roborovski's dwarf hamster (Phodopus roborovskii) of the Cricetinae The cricetids first evolved in the Old World during the Early Oligocene. They soon adapted to a wide range of habitats, and spread throughout the world. The voles and lemmings arose later, during the Pliocene, and rapidly diversified during the Pleistocene.Savage & Long (1986): 122‚Äì124 The circumscription of Cricetidae has gone through several permutations. Some members of the family as currently defined have been placed in the family Muridae. Some muroids have historically been placed in Cricetidae, such as mouse-like hamsters (subfamily Calomyscinae, family Calomyscidae), gerbils (subfamily Gerbillinae, family Muridae), the crested rat (subfamily Lophiomyinae, family Muridae), zokors (subfamily Myospalacinae, family Spalacidae), the white-tailed rat (subfamily Mystromyinae, family Nesomyidae), and spiny dormice (subfamily Platacanthomyinae, family Platacanthomyidae). Multigene DNA sequence studies have shown the subfamilies listed below to form a monophyletic group (that is, they share a common ancestor more recently than with any other group), and other groups now considered muroids should not be included in the Cricetidae.Michaux et al. (2001), Jansa & Weksler (2004), Norris et al. (2004), Steppan et al. (2004) The cricetids thus currently include one fossil and five extant subfamilies, with about 112 living genera and 580 species: * Arvicolinae ‚Äî voles, lemmings, muskrat * Cricetinae ‚Äî hamsters * Democricetodontinae ‚Ä† (fossil) * Neotominae ‚Äî North American rats and mice, including deer mice, pack rats, and grasshopper mice * Sigmodontinae ‚Äî New World rats and mice, predominantly South American, such as brucies * Tylomyinae ‚Äî New World climbing rats and relatives *Eumys ‚Ä† (fossil) *Wilsoneumys ‚Ä† (fossil)  References  * Eisenberg, J.F.; Feaver, J. & Krebs, C.J.

The decision to develop the Lavi was controversial, both with the Israeli public, due to the enormous associated costs, and particularly with the U.S. government due to competition with American jets on the export market. By 1984 Israel, with a population of 4 million, had the world's highest military expenditure as a proportion of GDP, at 24%, a rate of spending considered unsustainable. These issues contributed to the ultimate cancellation of the aircraft, by the Israeli government, during the flight-test phase of development in August 1987. The Lavi performed successfully in flight-tests, with its flight handling described as \\"excellent\\" by test pilots. The Lavi was planned to be the mainstay of the Israeli Air Force, and considerable export sales for the aircraft had been forecast. The uniqueness of its design was in the combination of a small, aerodynamic, highly maneuverable plane, with sophisticated, software-rich systems, low armed drag, and the ability to carry a large payload at high speed and over long distances. As of 2012, two of the prototypes have been preserved, and have been placed on public display. The Israeli cabinet's late- stage cancellation of the program, by a 12‚Äì11 vote, continued to arouse controversy and bitterness in Israel for decades, with Moshe Arens stating in 2013 that if the project had not been cancelled the IAF \\"would be operating the world's most advanced fighter, upgraded over the years to incorporate operational experience and newer technology.\\"In Israel, lingering bitterness over a failed fighter project 15 Oct. 2013, UPI Development =Origins= Conceptually, the Lavi had its origins in the idea espoused by IAF commander and Minister of Defence Ezer Weizman that Israel's combat aircraft should fall into 'two-tiers' ‚Äì a small number of high performance aircraft and a larger bulk with less sophistication and complexity. In the mid-1970s, the plane that was to become the Lavi was meant to be a multirole fighter-bomber to replace aging IAF aircraft such as the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and IAI Kfir; however continuous revisions of the proposed aircraft led to the incorporation of more advanced technologies and ideas to produce an ambitious aircraftVan Creveld 2008, p. 274. in the class of the American General Dynamics F-16. The IAF was estimated to have a requirement for 300 aircraft, 60 of which were expected to be combat-capable two-seat trainers. In February 1980, a milestone towards the development of the Lavi occurred when the Israeli government granted its authorisation for the IAF to present its list of technical specifications and requirements which sought the IAF's envisioned future fighter aircraft. While the Lavi was heavily influenced by these requirements, it was also affected by concepts of the wider strategic situation that Israel was confronted by. Menachem Eine, who headed the Lavi program, concluded that any proposed aircraft would be subject to a substantially greater threat than any envisioned US fighter, and would have to be developed with these threats in mind. Eine observed that the aircraft needed to not only take into consideration the best Soviet armaments that would be potentially faced in combat, but the best American equipment as well, as both Egypt and Saudi Arabia were being supplied with modern American fighter aircraft.Fleming 1983, p. 263. In addition to the primary intention to perform air-to-ground missions, the IAF sought to configure the Lavi to perform various other roles, as Israel perceived the likelihood of a potential sustained conflict under which there would be a need to fight for aerial supremacy against the efforts of multiple neighbouring adversaries to be high. The Lavi was therefore designed to possess both the flight performance and capabilities to perform as an effective supplement to the IAF's own F-15 fleet in carrying out aerial combat missions. As the Lavi was viewed as being relatively easy to fly, the aircraft was also under consideration as an advanced jet trainer as well.Farley 1991, p. 22. Early on, IAI decided to adopt a delta wing configuration, of which the company was already familiar with through its work on the earlier Kfir, which was paired with large, steerable canards situated forward of the wing. The delta wing arrangement was relatively low-weight, provided space for considerable fuel capacity, a smooth low-altitude fight attitude, and high levels of directional stability while flown at high angles of attack (AOA). The canard generated additional lift and positive control when at high AOAs. While this configuration afforded excellent maneuverability, it also exhibited natural instability during flight. To compensate, the Lavi was fitted with a sophisticated digital fly-by-wire system which allowed the aircraft to take advantage of this particular wing design while eliminating this shortcoming. The Lavi was one of the first aircraft to feature this type of configuration, which has since become more commonplace amongst fighter aircraft. The adoption of certain components, such as an engine produced by Pratt & Whitney, were viewed as foregone conclusions; the Beit Shemesh engine plant already had an established relationship with the company and planned to co-produce the engine, thus enabling some of the manufacturing to be carried out domestically in Israel. Some elements of the engine had to be manufactured in the US due to some of the design aspects having been classified as secret. The development of the Lavi was viewed by some figures in Israeli military and government circles, most notably Moshe Arens and Shimon Peres, as being an important program to modernise Israeli industry overall and to increase its technical ability, helping the nation progress towards becoming a developed nation. =Testing= Head-on view of a Lavi prototype The development program was planned to involve a total of five prototypes of the Lavi being completed, three of which were to have used a two-seat cockpit configuration. On 31 December 1986, the first prototype took off on its maiden flight. The test pilot, Menachem Shmul, head of IAI's Air Operations section, took off at 13:21 and stayed in the air for 26 minutes, during which he checked the engine and controls. The handling was described as \\"excellent\\", with a high degree of stability in crosswind landings. About three months later, a second Lavi prototype took to the air; it featured improvements and additional features over the first, with a belly-mounted fuel tank, a special midair refuelling probe and several new avionic systems. Both B-01 and B-02 were tandem two-seaters, with the rear cockpit occupied by test equipment. By August 1987, the month in which the Lavi was canceled, a total of 82 sorties had reportedly been flown between the two completed prototypes, during which a significant proportion of the flight envelope had been explored.Arens, Moshe. \\"Books: Who shot down the Lavi?\\" Jerusalem Post, 3 March 2016. =Controversy and cancellation= While the Lavi had attracted the steadfast support of IAF veteran and Likud minister Moshe Arens, there was considerable dissent over the development. While the U.S. was a key partner in the aircraft's development, there was vocal political opposition to financing the Lavi, which may have been a competitive aircraft in the export market against American aircraft such as the F-16C/D and the F/A-18C/D. The Lavi would have also required a great deal of other competing military requirements and sought investments to be abandoned, thus there were elements of the armed forces that did not support the project and those officers who felt that the F-16 possessed similar performance to the Lavi and was readily available already, making the foreign F-16 cheaper and easier to procure.Rabinovich and Shaked 1989, pp. 465‚Äì66.Van Creveld 2008, p. 271. IAF Major General Avihu Ben- Nun argued in favour of canceling the Lavi and acquiring 75 F-16s instead.Haglund 1989, p. 206. Proponents, such as the Minister without Portfolio Moshe Arens, advocated that the Lavi was a high prestige program, asserting Israeli technological capabilities and would work to the nation's economic advantage. A failure to proceed with the development could lead to significant job losses and possibly contribute to emigration; the Israeli State Comptroller argued the resulting unemployment was negligible.Haglund 1989, pp. 205‚Äì6. Arens was keen to promote potential partnerships and technology exchanges in regards to the Lavi.Hunter 1987, pp. 44‚Äì45. Perhaps optimistically, IAI had projected export sales of the Lavi to be as many as 407 units to customers including South Africa, Chile, Taiwan, and Argentina; there were reports of significant South African interest and involvement during the early development of the Lavi.Hunter 1987, p. 44. In later development, however, Israel had given the U.S. explicit guarantees that the Lavi would not be made available to export.Hunter 1987, p. 45. Shimon Peres seated in the cockpit of a mock-up Lavi, August 1985 Prior to and following the cancellation, IAI employees organised numerous demonstrations and public appeals to rally support for the Lavi; public opinion was roughly evenly divided on the subject of the Lavi.Rabinovich and Shaked 1989, pp. 464‚Äì467. In the US, there was considerable opposition to the Lavi program from the Pentagon due to the fear that the heavy financial costs would impair other military capabilities, there were also questions about the financial soundness of the project and that Lavi technologies may be shared with South Africa, which had a history of close military cooperation with Israel. The financial burden of developing the Lavi were such that the Governor of the Bank of Israel, Michael Bruno, publicly stated that Israel could not realistically afford the \\"luxury of producing fighter-aircraft\\" and would harm overall economic growth.Haglund 1989, pp. 208, 212. On 30 August 1987, Israel's cabinet conducted a decisive vote on whether to continue the development of the Lavi; this development was influenced by considerable lobbying by the U.S., who made several compensatory proposals in exchange for the cancellation.Haglund 1989, pp. 214‚Äì213.Friedman, Thomas L. \\"Israelis Decide Not to Construct Lavi Jet Fighter\\". New York Times, 31 August 1987.Druckman, Yaron. \\"The Israeli fighter jet that never was.\\" ynetnews.com, 30 August 2015. The vote was highly politicised, the Israeli Labor Party ordered its members to vote against the project.Arens, Moshe. \\"The Lavi, a Dream Aborted in Mid- flight.\\" Haarterz, 5 September 2012. The Cabinet rejected the continuation at a margin of 12‚Äì11, with one cabinet member abstaining. Following the outcome of the vote, Lavi supporter Moshe Arens offered his resignation, refusing to be associated with the decision to terminate the aircraft.Haglund 1989, p. 213. Shortly afterwards, Israel approved the purchase of 90 F-16Cs from the United States, which acted as an effective replacement to the Lavi.Haglund 1989, p. 215. It was reported that China and South Africa were interested in continuing with the development of the Lavi. =Aftermath and legacy= When the Lavi project was canceled in 1987, a total of five airframes had been manufactured. Prototypes B-01 and B-02 had been completed, while B-03, B-04, and B-05 were incomplete. Parts from B-01 and B-02 were pulled to complete B-03. The gutted airframe of B-02 was subsequently placed on static display at the Israeli Air Force museum at Hatzerim Airbase; the remaining units, B-01, B-04 and B-05, were all ultimately scrapped.Israel Aircraft Industries: Lavi Two years after the project's cancelation, IAI completed the third Lavi prototype (B-03), which made its first flight on 25 September 1989. B-03 proceeded to serve as a technology demonstrator and as a flying testbed for various internal IAI development projects; the aircraft saw later use as a ground testbed as well. Israel's independence in 2007 While the Lavi project had been terminated without any production aircraft being produced, the development represented an important opportunity to demonstrate and advance the capabilities of Israel's aerospace industry. Many of the aircraft's subsystems, avionics, and components went on to be developed and made commercially available, fueling defense export sales and proving to be a lucrative business in its own right.\\"IAI Fills Gaps Left by Lavi\\". Jerusalem Post, 4 July 1990. The EL/M-2032 pulse doppler radar, which had originally been developed for use on the Lavi is one such example; it has since been exported and equipped upon a wide range of operational aircraft.\\"Lockheed Martin will offer Elta radar for Israeli air force F-16.\\" Flight International, 28 January 1998.\\"Multimode Airborne Fire Control Radar - EL/M-2032.\\" IAI Elta, Retrieved: 24 September 2016. Despite the Lavi's cancellation, the investment in its development had significant results. The technological knowledge accumulated during the development contributed to the achievement of Israel's first launch of a satellite into space in 1988. It resulted in a new level in avionics systems, and contributed to Israel's high- tech boom of the 1990s by releasing into the economy the technological talents of around 5,000 Israeli scientists and engineers who had been employed on this one project; many, for example, were reemployed on the Arrow anti-ballistic missile program.Senor and Singer 2009, pp. 181‚Äì183. In July 2013, the IAF announced that the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master, an advanced trainer aircraft that it was in the process of procuring at the time, would receive the name Lavi in Israeli service; a total of 30 M-346s are to be operated by the service from 2014.Egozi, Arie. \\"Israel's Lavi reborn as renamed M-346.\\" Flight International, 2 July 2013.Dombe, Ami Rojkes. \\"Israeli Defense Ministry Received the Last 'LAVI' Jet Trainer.\\" Israel Defense, 8 June 2016. =China Question= In 2008, aviation publishing house Jane's alleged that China's development of the Chengdu J-10 had benefited from technical information from the Lavi project, citing Russian engineers who claim to have heard this from Chinese colleagues. In 2007, the J-10's designer, Song Wencong (ÂÆãÊñáÈ™¢), denied any connection with the Lavi, pointing to similarities with the Chengdu J-9 developed in the 1960s. This was echoed by PLAAF major Zhang Weigang in a 2012 interview. There have been no public statements or formal claims along those lines; by 2000, however, advanced technology transfer of any origin had become anathema to the US,Adelman, Jonathan. \\"The Phalcon Sale to China: The Lessons For Israel\\". Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Retrieved 27 September 2007. which forced Israel to cancel a sale of Phalcon airborne early warning planes. Design =Overview= Forward fuselage of an IAI Lavi The IAI Lavi was a single-seat, single-engine multirole fighter aircraft, principally designed to conduct high-speed penetration and first-pass bombing missions while maintaining a high level of manoeuvrability and survivability. It bore considerable similarities in terms of external appearance to the American F-16 fighter, having a similar configuration and several shared design features while being a slightly smaller aircraft. The engine air intake took the form of a plain chin type scoop with a splitter plate, externally resembling that of the F-16, yet internally it was substantially different. For one example, an inverse S-duct prevents exposure of the engine compressor blades to the front view of the aircraft. This drastically minimizes the frontal cross- sections of infrared and radar alike. In comparison to the F-16, the Lavi was furnished with a less powerful engine and a consequently lower thrust-to- weight ratio. It was envisioned that the Lavi's lifecycle costs would be considerably beneath those of the F-16, efforts were also made to achieve a lower procurement cost as well. Like the F-16, the Lavi was an aerodynamically unstable aircraft, employing a quadruplex-redundant digital fly-by-wire system in order to provide stability and control; this was one of the aircraft's more innovative features. The Lavi was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney PW1120 turbofan engine, capable of generating 20,260 lb of thrust and enabling the aircraft to attain a maximum speed of Mach 1.85.Fleming 1983, p. 237. The engine, which was derived from the Pratt & Whitney F100 that powered the F-16, was the only aspect of the aircraft that Eine acknowledged to have created a dependency upon the US. While carrying eight 750lb bombs the Lavi possessed a combat radius of 250 nmi; an alternative armament of 2,000 lb bombs enabled a 650 nmi combat radius. Possessing a 1.1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio while equipped with a combat payload, the airframe of the Lavi was designed to be capable of routinely withstanding up to 9g. =Airframe= The Lavi employed a mainly traditional airframe, the majority of development focus being upon the avionics and systems to provide the aircraft's performance edge instead. In order to meet the low structural weight requirements imposed, the use of composite materials was employed in elements such as the wing and its substructure, as well as the fin and the skin. The forward fuselage was shaped in a manner that resulted in it naturally directing air into the engine intake and to avoid inlet blanking while flown at a sideslip condition. The nose of a Lavi on static display in Beer-Sheva, 2006 The wing was unusual in having a shallow sweep on the trailing edge, giving a fleche planform; the straight leading edge was swept at 54 degrees, with maneuver flaps on the outboard sections. Two piece flaperons occupied most of the trailing edge, which was blended into the fuselage with long fillets.Deurenberg, Ruud. \\"Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Lavi.\\" Jewish Virtual Library, Retrieved: 23 September 2016. A total of nine flight control surfaces were actuated by a quadruplex fly-by- wire (FBW) system, which lacked any mechanical backup counterpart, providing a factor of aerodynamic instability of between 10 and 12 per cent. The wingtips were cropped and fitted with missile rails to carry Rafael Python 3 air-to-air missile. At 38.5 square meters, the wing area was 38 per cent greater than the F-16, while the aspect ratio was 2.10, barely two-thirds that of the F-16. Development of the wing and fin were the responsibility of Grumman, who were contracted to initially manufacture the first 20 of each. The canards, located slightly astern of and below the pilot, caused minimal obstruction in vision. They allowed for pitch control in a single-piece, all-moving arrangement. The nose wheel was located aft of the intake and retracted rearwards, with the light-weight main gear mounted on the fuselage. A sharply swept vertical tail was mounted on a spine on top of the rear fuselage, and was supplemented by two steeply canted ventral strakes, mounted on the ends of the wing root fillets. Composites, used in 22% of the airframe, allowed aerolastic tailoring to the wings. They were used also in the vertical tail, the canards, and various doors and panels. IAI claimed a significant reduction in radar cross section. =Avionics= Closeup view of the Lavi's supersonic air intake with splitter plate According to Eine, the Lavi's main area of advancement over its contemporaries was the level of integration of avionics and onboard electronics; it was claimed that the Lavi was \\"more computerised than any other system in the world\\".Fleming 1983, pp. 236-237. A key innovation was the use of a quadruplex-redundant digital fly-by-wire flight control system, which was co-developed by Lear Siegler and IAI. If it had been brought into service, the Lavi may have become the first operational aircraft to employ fully digital flight controls. The avionics suite was almost entirely of Israeli design, and employed a modular design capable of adding upgrades via the Elbit ACE-4 mission computer. The Lavi had a bootstrap-type hydraulic system, pressurised by Adex pumps providing 207 bars of pressure to the flight surfaces. The electronics were powered by a Sundstrand 60 kVA integrated drive generator, with a SAFT main battery and Marathon standby; Sundstrand also provided the actuation system. The emergency power unit (EPU) and environmental control system were produced by Garrett AiResearch, as was the secondary power system. IAI subsidiary Elta held responsibility for the electronic warfare self-protection systems. These are claimed to have been capable of rapid threat identification and automated response, incorporating a suite of active and passive countermeasures, such as power-managed noise and deception jamming systems. Both podded and internal countermeasures were to be used. Elta also developed the EL/M-2032 Doppler multi-mode radar for the Lavi, which was equipped with a programmable signal processor and was capable of various air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, including high-resolution mapping, terrain avoidance, and look-down/shoot-down functionality. =Cockpit= All- round pilot vision was provided by a wrap-around windshield and bubble canopy. Unlike the F-16's steeply raked seat and sidestick controller, however, the Lavi employed a conventional upright seat and central control column. The cockpit employed HOTAS (hands-on-throttle and stick) controls, while a Hughes Aircraft wide-angle diffractive optics head up display (HUD) was integrated onto a single El-Op up-front control panel. There were a total of three conventional display units, two of which were color. Display redundancy was ensured via data-sharing between the HMDs. A fully computerised Elta ARC-740 ultra high frequency (UHF) radio was incorporated along with a navigation suite, the latter of which included the Tuman TINS 1700 advanced inertial navigation system. Aspects such as flexibility and situational awareness were emphasized to reduce pilot workload while under high g-forces and within a dense threat environment. The use of sidestick controller had been discounted for three main reasons: it took too much space on the starboard console; it was difficult for an instructor pilot to monitor his pupil as it was a force transducer; and it would mean that so much as a minor right arm injury would jeopardise the mission. The adoption of a tilted seat was ruled out during development since it would have elevated the pilot's knees, causing a reduction in available panel space, and would also cause the high-g neck and shoulder strain injuries that were common amongst F-16 pilots. The standard practice of providing a second seat for conversion training, by means of reduced fuel or avionics was shunned by IAI. They designed the two-seater as the base model which was then adapted into a single-seater, leaving ample space for avionics growth. It was intended that the first 30 production aircraft would be two-seaters to aid service entry.

Biography Adan was born in Kfar Giladi, British Mandate Palestine, in 1926 as Avraham Eidelson. He joined the Palmach in 1943. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War he was a company commander in the 8th Battalion of the Negev Brigade, and participated in Operation Uvda, in which the brigade captured the Jordanian outpost of Umm Rashrash, now known as Eilat, at the southernmost tip of the newly created country. It was he who raised the Ink Flag claiming the territory for Israel, as depicted in the famous photograph of the event. The iconic image has been compared to Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima. Adan joined the Armored Corps in 1949 and founded the first Sherman tank unit in the IDF. During the 1956 Suez War, Lieutenant Colonel Adan commanded the 82nd battalion of the 7th Armored Brigade in the Sinai, defeating several Egyptian forces in the region. After the war he became the operations officer of the corps, then the commander of the 7th Brigade and the Armored Corps School. During the June 1967 Six-Day War, Adan was the deputy commander of the Armored Corps and of the 31st Armored Division, fighting again in the Sinai. On 10 March 1969, he became the commander of the Armored Corps. Major General Adan was defending the northern portion of the Israeli defense along the Suez Canal when the October 1973 Yom Kippur War broke out. As the commander of the 162nd Division, his division suffered severe losses from 6 to 8 October, in repeated attempts to stop the Egyptian attack and push it back across the canal. Later on during the war he led his unit across the canal into Egyptian territory just north of the Great Bitter Lake, during Operation Stouthearted Men. He then maneuvered his unit southward to Suez City, where his unit surrounded the Egyptian Third Army. From 1974 to 1977 he served as the Armed Forces Attach√© at the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. Adan was among the founders of Kibbutzim Nirim and Gvulot.

It is an entertaining introduction to everyday machines, describing machines as simple as levers and gears and as complicated as radio telescopes and automatic transmissions.

These diagrams are informative but playful, in that most show the machines operated, used upon, or represented by woolly mammoths, and are accompanied by anecdotes of the mammoths' (fictive) role in the operation. The book's concept was later developed into a short-lived animated TV show (produced by Millimages and distributed by Schlessinger Media), a Dorling Kindersley interactive CD-ROM, and a board game.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and unsuccessfully sought election to the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative candidate in the federal riding of Sarnia-Lambton in 2004. Background Beaubien was an insurance broker in private life, and served as President of the Sarnia United Way. Politics He began his political career at the municipal level, serving as a councillor in Petrolia, of which he later became mayor. He also served as a regional councillor for Lambton County. He was elected to the Ontario legislature for the provincial riding of Lambton in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal candidate Larry O'Neill by over 4,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Beaubien served as a government backbencher for the next four years. In 1995, Beaubien put pressure on the newly elected provincial government to intervene in the native protest at Ipperwash which culminated in the Ipperwash Crisis. From July 1995 to April 1997, Premier Mike Harris assigned him as the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. In 1998, he was responsible for a spearheading a government decision to deny Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage to patients seeking sex-change operations. In the provincial election of 1999, Beaubien defeated O'Neill again by fewer than 1,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Lambton‚ÄîKent‚ÄîMiddlesex. As before, he was not appointed to cabinet and served as a government backbencher. On April 25, 2002, newly minted Premier Ernie Eves appointed him to the position of parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, Janet Ecker. The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the provincial election of 2003, and Beaubien lost his seat to Liberal Maria Van Bommel by over 3,500 votes. The following year, he challenged long-serving Liberal MP Roger Gallaway in the federal riding of Sarnia‚ÄîLambton, and lost by over 5,000 votes.

Vaughan is generally considered to be one of the founders of the genre now known as \\"Southern gospel\\" music.See southern gospel and Charles Davis Tillman. He started the James D. Vaughan Music Publishing Company in 1900 in Minor Hill, Tennessee, and in 1910 moved to Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. He taught shape note singing schools. He was the first to establish a professional quartet and put them on the road for the purpose of selling songbooks. The Vaughan School of Music was formed in 1911 in Lawrenceburg. Numerous gospel performers would study there in the following years. In 1912, Vaughan began the Vaughan Family Visitor, an influential publication across the South during the early 20th century. In 1922, Vaughan founded one of the first radio stations in Tennessee, WOAN, where he broadcast Southern Gospel music until 1930. He also founded the first record company based in the South, Vaughan Phonograph Records. Vaughan was also involved in local politics, serving as mayor of Lawrenceburg from 1923 to 1927, a position his brother Charles Wesley and son would hold after him. As one of the most significant figures in southern gospel music, James D. Vaughan was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1997.

Hale, Sr.) until his own death on January 24, 2007. Mercado became the oldest documented living person on December 11, 2006, following the death of 116-year-old Elizabeth Bolden. At the time of his death in January 2007, at the age of 115 years and 156 days, Mercado was the second oldest fully validated male ever, behind Danish-American Christian Mortensen's record of 115 years 252 days. (Although Shigechiyo Izumi was still believed to be older at the time of his death. Izumi's record was withdrawn by Guinness World Records in 2010.) Biography Emiliano (known to his family as \\"Emilio\\") was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, (at a time when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony) the son of Delf√≠n Mercado C√°ceres and Gumercinda del Toro Padilla.Puerto Rico Civil Registration Records Emiliano worked in the cane fields until the age of 81. He never married and never had children, but said he had three \\"girlfriends\\" (love interests) in his life.Amazon.com: Earth's Elders - Wisdom, World's Oldest - p. 210: \\"Emiliano never married\\". =Accolades= Mercado first came to the attention of longevity researchers in 2001, when a story ran about a 110-year-old veteran in a parade in Puerto Rico. After that, researchers tried to track him down, but only after the November 2004 death of Fred H. Hale, Sr. did someone finally start sending in documents. Following Mr. Hale's death, Emiliano apparently became the oldest man in the world, with documents supplied so far including a birth certificate, baptismal certificate, 1910 census record, and veteran ID card. By January 2005, Guinness had accepted Emiliano as the \\"oldest living man whose age could be fully authenticated\\". In addition, Emiliano Mercado del Toro was 27 years old in October 1918 when the U.S. Army drafted him to serve in World War I. As a veteran of World War I he broke the record for longest- lived veteran of any military force, previously set by Antonio Todde (Mercado was still at a training camp in Panama when the November 11, 1918 armistice was declared). Mercado was discharged the following month, when he was still 27. In 1993, he was honored by U.S. President Bill Clinton with the medal commemorating the 75th anniversary of the signing of the truce that ended World War I. Mercado del Toro, the elder of two siblings, had to move from his familiar Cabo Rojo grounds due to a fall he had in his home when he was 102, which affected his hipbone. His 85-year-old niece took him to live with his relatives, and he was well taken care of by nieces and nephews - and their families, who called him \\"T√≠o Millo\\" (\\"Uncle Millo\\")- at their home in Isabela. =Later life= Mercado could reminisce about being a child when U.S. troops invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, and he clearly remembered the fighting that marked the end of Spain's colonial empire in the Americas. He credited his longevity to funche, a boiled corn, codfish and milk cream-like dish, which he ate every day as a habit. Mercado also claimed that his sense of humor was probably responsible for his long life, and he would tell jokes and humorous anecdotes almost to the end of his days. He would not elaborate on details of his love life, but would humorously hint about them: in one of the many interviews he gave to Puerto Rican media, Mercado claimed to have been at the \\"dancing club\\" (a euphemism for a bordello) owned by Isabel Luberza Oppenheimer (better known as \\"Isabel la Negra\\") the day she was killed. He was 82 years old at the time and reportedly hid under a table when Oppenheimer's killers started firing gunshots. Asked what he was doing there, he said: \\"praying ... or at least I was when the bullets started flying!\\" His last two birthdays were media events in the town of Isabela. Civic leaders and veterans commended Mercado on his endurance and lucid mind, but the \\"gift\\" he would enjoy the most was the visit of Puerto Rican vedette and media icon Iris Chac√≥n. In an interview, Mercado claimed to be a great fan of the artist, and particularly of her derri√®re (\\"That rump was something serious!\\", he was quoted as saying). Chac√≥n visited Mercado, who, although he could barely see or hear by the time of his 114th birthday, was pleased with her visit. His photo touching Chac√≥n's rear end, with a big smile on his face, made newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico. She returned the following year to greet him. After hearing news of Mercado's death, Chac√≥n was quoted as saying: \\"I feel like I've lost my own grandfather. I was blessed for knowing him, knowing that I made him happy, and blessed for the anecdotes and wishes he told me the times I met him. His wisdom is something I learned a lot from. His life is an example of how you're supposed to live your life, happily and doing good, for it will give you longevity and goodwill from everyone.\\" He was buried at Cementerio Municipal San Mart√≠n de Porres of his native town of Cabo Rojo, with mayors, legislators, fellow veterans and Puerto Rican \\"vedette\\" Iris Chac√≥n in attendance.

Kieffer was born near Miami, Saline County, Missouri. He died in Dayton, Virginia, and is buried there. Kieffer was the grandson of Mennonite musician Joseph Funk. After Funk's death, he and Ephraim Ruebush took over Funk's publishing company. With Ruebush and John W. Howe, Kieffer founded the Kieffer, Ruebush, & Company music company circa 1873, which was moved from Singers Glen to Dayton, Virginia in 1878. Kieffer was editor of the Musical Million and Fireside Friend periodical. The Musical Million, published from 1870 until 1914, was one of the leading tools promoting shape note music for almost a half century. It helped link teachers and students across the country, and published many songs in its pages. Kieffer taught singing schools and used his songbooks in the schools. One of Kieffer's most popular song books was The Temple Star, published at Singer's Glen in 1877. One of his most popular songs was his poem Twilight is Stealing, set to music by B. C.

Home Entertainment (formerly known as Warner Home Video and WCI Home Video), is the home video distribution division of AT&T;'s WarnerMedia, operated under its WarnerMedia Commercial division. It was founded in 1978 as WCI Home Video (for Warner Communications, Inc.). The company launched in the United States with twenty films on Betamax and VHS videocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980. History The company launched in the United States with twenty films on Betamax and VHS videocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980. Some of the company's early releases were time-compressed in order to save tape time and money and to compensate for long-playing cassettes being unavailable in the early days of home video. One example was 1978's Superman in which the film was released in a 127-minute format, compared to its 143-minute theatrical release. In addition, early film-to-video transfers of films from WCI were noted for being in poor quality, compared to modern day video releases. By the end of 1980, the quality of transfers had improved. The company was noted in its early days for releases in big cardboard boxes that opened like a book, colored in black, with cast credits on the inside. Some early releases under the Warner Home Video name also used this design. In early 1981, the company switched to plastic clamshell cases, with a multicolor design, with a few releases using the cardboard boxes and the multicolor designs, and to cardboard sleeves in 1985 for packaging, eliminating plastic cases by 1986. In the mid 1990s, the studio revived the use of plastic cases for a handful of releases from Warner Bros. Family Entertainment. Warner Bros. began to branch out into the videodisc market, licensing titles to MCA DiscoVision and RCA's SelectaVision videodisc formats, allowing both companies to market and distribute the films under their labels. By 1985, Warner was releasing material under their own label in both formats. Titles from Warner Home Video were and continue to be distributed and manufactured by Roadshow Home Video worldwide except for Australia and New Zealand because of its film counterpart's films released by Village Roadshow. =Rentals= Warner also experimented with the \\"rental-only\\" market for videos, a method also used by 20th Century Fox for their first release of Star Wars in 1982. Two known films released in this manner were Superman II and Excalibur. Other films released for rental use include Dirty Harry, The Enforcer, Prince of the City, and Sharky's Machine. =Notable firsts, Warner Archive Collection and distribution= In 1990, Warner Home Video acquired the worldwide home video rights to the MGM/UA catalog. The $125 million purchase was used to finance MGM/UA's acquisition by the Path√© Communications Corporation. The intended 12¬Ω-year-long deal was cut short in February 2000, with MGM paying Warner Bros. $225 million to regain video rights to a number of its films. In exchange, Warner Bros. gained full control over the video rights to MGM's pre-1986 library, an asset the studio acquired outright from Turner, but due to a pre-existing licensing deal with MGM, was expected to expire in 2001. With the merger of Time Warner and Turner Broadcasting in 1996, Turner Home Entertainment was absorbed into WHV, with WHV inheriting Turner's video lines, including a previous deal with PBS Home Video and Cartoon Network video titles. WHV also assumed responsibility for distributing the product of New Line Home Video (later renamed as New Line Home Entertainment), though New Line otherwise maintained autonomy until 2010 after New Line Cinema itself was absorbed into Warner Bros. WHV also eventually absorbed HBO Home Entertainment by the mid-2000s, after that division switched from mostly distributing third- party titles to HBO's own material. On December 20, 1996, Warner Home Video was one of the first major American distributors for the then-new DVD format, by releasing the films Assassins, Blade Runner: Director's Cut, Eraser, and The Fugitive on DVD in Japan and on March 24, 1997 in the United States with Blade Runner also being a launch title for the region there. Warner Bros. executive Warren Lieberfarb is often seen as \\"the father of DVD\\". Lieberfarb's successor, Warner Bros. executive James F. Cardwell was recognized in paving the way for WHV's strategic positioning in next generation technologies such as High Definition DVD, electronic sell-through and portable video. In 2003, Warner Home Video became the first home video releasing company to release movies only on DVD with no VHS equivalent. On September 26, 2006, Warner Home Video became the first company to release a title in three formats on the same day and date with the home release of The Lake House on DVD, Blu-ray and HD DVD. With Paramount Home Entertainment switching from neutral in the high definition video camp to solely to HD DVD in September 2007, Warner Home Video was at the time the only major distributor to support both high definition formats, though this changed at the end of May 2008. From June 2008, Warner Home Video released new high definition content on Blu-ray only, becoming the last major Hollywood studio to drop HD DVD after Toshiba discontinued the HD DVD format. Warner Home Video briefly owned New Line Home Entertainment after New Line was absorbed by Warner Bros. in 2008. In 2010, New Line Home Entertainment was then folded into Warner Home Video. Warner Home Video continues to use the NLHE logo on Blu-ray and DVD reprints on titles before Valentine's Day. In 2009, Warner Home Video introduced the Warner Archive Collection, which allows the public to order custom-made DVDs of rarely seen films and TV series from the Warner and Turner libraries. The films are also available as digital downloads. Warner Archive DVDs and downloads can be ordered online on Warner's website, on Amazon.com or Turner Classic Movies- affiliated DVD website Movies Unlimited. (Although Movies Unlimited sells these archive titles, it usually takes 2‚Äì3 months before the DVD is available for order after Warner releases it on their website.) In October 2012, Paramount Home Media Distribution and Warner Home Video signed a distribution deal, allowing Warner Bros. to gain U.S. and Canadian DVD, Blu-ray, UltraViolet, Flixster, and DVD-manufacturing-on-demand distribution rights to over 600 Paramount Pictures titles as well as new Paramount titles. The deal went into effect on January 1, 2013, and expired in 2017. On January 1, 2015, the company replaced Cinedigm in distribution of content from WWE Libraries in a deal with WWE, including content from former corporate sibling World Championship Wrestling. On January 14, 2020, Universal and Warner Home Video announced that they would partner on a 10-year multinational joint-venture, merging their physical operations in North America. Universal will distribute Warner Bros.' titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; while Warners will distribute Universal's titles in the U.K., Italy and Benelux. On April 7, 2020, the European Commission approved the merger.https://www.mediaplaynews.com/european-commission-approves-warner- universal-home-entertainment-joint-venture/ On August 7, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment was moved from Warner Bros. to the newly-formed WarnerMedia Commercial division due to a major restructuring within the company. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, however, remains part of WarnerMedia's Studios & Networks group. Catalog The company currently releases titles from the film and television library of Warner Bros. as well as programs from other WarnerMedia companies, including WarnerMedia Entertainment, WarnerMedia News & Sports, HBO, New Line Cinema, DC Comics, Telepictures, Hanna-Barbera, and Turner Entertainment Co. WBHE also releases titles from Samuel Goldwyn Productions, Peanuts Worldwide, Lego, MGM Home Entertainment (since 2020, taking over from Disney/Fox), Viz Media, and WWE. From July 1, 2000 to 2017, Warner Home Video served as distributor of BBC Video releases in North America, although in 2008 their logo was phased out of the releases; starting in 2017, the BBC began self-distributing its titles in North America. Warner Home Video formerly distributed titles from PBS Home Video and PBS Kids until 2004, Big Idea Productions from 2002 to 2004, LeapFrog from 2003 to 2005 (when video distribution moved to Lionsgate), The Wiggles from 2007 until late 2011 (when video distribution moved to NCircle Entertainment), Sesame Street from 2010 to 2018 (when distribution moved to Shout! Factory), American Girl,, National Geographic Society in the U.S., and product from the NBA,https://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/‚Äúgreatest-moments-nba-history‚Äù-dvd- warner-home-video the NFL, and the NHL. International In 1981, Warner Home Video released United Artists titles on video overseas. This deal was extended up to 2000 via its deal with MGM-Pathe. In the UK, Warner Home Video formerly distributed most of the DVD releases of Icon Home Entertainment, and also distributed Icon releases in Australia. In Canada, it previously distributed releases from Seville Pictures and Equinox Films. In the Netherlands and France, Warner Home Video formerly distributed most new releases from Independent Films, through the RTL Group's M6 subsidiary. Warner Home Video also released World Championship Wrestling events and compilations throughout the 1990s in various territories until it was dismantled in 2001. In 1996, Warner Home Video had reached a deal on releasing Twister, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Maverick, The Fugitive and three Batman films in China through Shenzen Advanced Science Enterprise Group. In 2006, Warner Home Video became the first major studio in Italy to release titles for digital download-to-own. In Poland, Warner Home Video served as distributor of most Warner Bros. and Turner Entertainment movies on VHS and DVD from 1993 to 2007, before being closed. Since 2007, Warner Bros.' home video distribution in Poland is being handled by local distributor Galapagos Films, Inc. In Russia, Warner Home Video served as distributor of most Varus Video on VHS (1994‚Äì1999) and Most-Video on VHS and DVD (2000‚Äì2002), later Premier Video Film on DVD (2002‚Äì2005) (with Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, Miramax Films (1996‚Äì2001) and 20th Century Fox (1996‚Äì2000) movies on VHS and DVD, before being closed, later Warner Bros., Paramount and Universal served as distributor of most Universal Pictures Rus, in late 2010, CP-Digital (former subsidiary Central Partnership) and Warner Home Video signed a distribution deal, allowing Warner Bros. to gain Russia on DVD, Blu- ray, distribution rights as well as new Warner titles. The deal came into effect as of January 1, 2011. In Japan, Warner Home Video had assumed Japanese home entertainment distribution of the Miramax catalog in 2012 until it expired on December 31, 2014. Alongside the announcement of the Warner Bros./Universal NA physical home media joint-venture, Warner Bros. announced that they would begin handling home video distribution of Universal titles in the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in the first quarter of 2021, while Universal announced that they would begin handling home video distribution of Warner Bros. titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan in the third quarter of 2020.

It stars Adam Goldberg, Judy Greer, Andy Dick, Mario Van Peebles, and Peter Coyote. The plot concerns a Jewish blaxploitation crime fighter known as the Hebrew Hammer who must save Hanukkah from the evil son of Santa Claus, who wants to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and make everyone celebrate Christmas. The film parodies blaxploitation films, and features Melvin Van Peebles in a cameo as \\"Sweetback\\". Plot The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. He feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren't welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying \\"Jews 'OK' (for about 5 minutes)\\" and spins his dreidel to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the finger. The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified circumcised dick who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a Hasidic Jew) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance. This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim. The fight takes them to exotic locales such as Israel, K-Mart, the Jewish Atomic Clock outside Jerusalem and the final battle at the North Pole. Cast * Adam Goldberg as Mordechai Jefferson Carver / The Hebrew Hammer ** Grant Rosenmeyer as young Mordechai * Judy Greer as Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal * Andy Dick as Damian Claus * Mario Van Peebles as Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim * Peter Coyote as Jewish Justice League Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal * Nora Dunn as Mrs. Carver * Sean Whalen as Tiny Tim * Tony Cox as Jamal * Richard Riehle as Santa * Melvin Van Peebles (cameo) as Sweetback * Rachel Dratch as Tikva * Harrison Chad as Schlomo * Annie McEnroe as Mrs. Highsmith * Elaine Hendrix as Blonde bombshell * Ed Koch as himself * Jimmy Walsh as Freckle-Faced Gentile * Jason Fuchs as Adolescent Hasidic Boy Controversy The Hebrew Hammer parodies many common stereotypes about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the Anti-Defamation League, which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant. Many scenes were shot in Borough Park, Brooklyn, which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film A Price Above Rubies, and shut down filming. The reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood actually agreed to appear as extras in the film. Reception The film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes. Sequel In 2017, plans for a sequel titled The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler were announced. The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding. It will begin in the present day, with the Hammer coming out of retirement to fight the increase in racism brought on by Donald Trump's election. He does this by going back in time to fight the worst source of antisemitism in the 20th century.

Snowskate (Snowdeck) ‚Äì \\"Burton Junkyard\\" A snowskate is a hybrid of a skateboard and a snowboard, intended primarily to allow for skateboard-style tricks on the snow. There are many types depending on the brand or style of snowskate.  History and design  The first snowskate traces its history to the Snurfer circa 1964. The Snurfer is considered to be the first snowboard to ever hit the market, but it could arguably be called the first snowskate, since it was without bindings. Joshua Luther first coined the phrase snowskate when he needed a way to get across town during a blizzard. Around 1970, a product called the \\"Snow Skate\\" was sold in local toy and sporting good stores. They resembled the modern day Fuse snowskate. There were two ski-like apparatuses that were attached to the area around the truck of a skateboard, allowing the skateboard to move through the snow. The \\"Ski\\" portion of the snow skate is made of a hard plastic with rubber straps that went over the skateboard wheels to hold them together. Other mentionable early snowskate brands were The \\"Skeeter\\" and the \\"Snodad\\". Designs of this early era ranged from two skiblades on the lower deck (Like the Skeeter) to four blades on the lower deck. Sometimes, the early snowskates used metal runners, similar to ice skate blades, enabling the snowskater to use the momentum to ride well. The \\"Snodad\\" came about much later in time. It was created by PNW skaters with the intent of riding fresh snow without bindings. Unfortunately the demise of the company came shortly after its official launch. It exists only as a historical \\"tip of the hat\\" to these pioneers of snowboarding without bindings.  Modern snowskates  Snowskates are now available in four varieties: the single deck variety, the bideck variety, the 4x4 variety, and the powderskate variety. All of the modern snowskates have either a waterproof top grip coating on the deck, or a textured deck to avoid slippage while riding.  Single deck  Single deck Snowskates are usually made out of laminated wood with a plastic bottom or are made of solid plastic, There are grooves cut into the bottom of the board, usually 7 or 5. Single decks are preferred for riding in snowskate parks and urban terrain but can also be ridden down hills, however, they are rarely permitted on ski resorts. Snowskates of this kind are most suitable for winter skateboarding tricks. Single deck snowskates first appeared on the market in 1998, manufactured by Premier Snowskates and marketed by Andy Wolf, former member of the Nitro snowboarding team. Today the primary manufacturers are: Ambition Snowskates, Icon Snowskates, LY Snow and Krown Skateboards. Snowskate parks became numerous when the first single deck snowskates were being sold in stores. Word of mouth quickly spread about the single deck snowskate, leading to the popularity of snowskate parks around United States. The snowskate park moved snowskating from an urban underground winter sport to a mainstream winter sport. With the introduction of the snowboard, many resorts have removed their snowskate parks, and snowskating has moved back to its underground winter sport roots.  Bideck  A bideck snowskate A bideck snowskate is a snowskate that has a top skateboard deck which the rider stands on and a lower ski deck, which is in contact with the snow. Bidecks come in single blade varieties and multiple blade varieties. Bideck snowskates were reportedly invented by a Stevens Pass (Washington) local named Steve Frink. He came up with the idea of a skateboard with skis in 1994 while burning his skateboard in a skateboarders' ritual. In the year 2001, after many prototypes, he completed a final and finished product which he marketed under the brand \\"Bi-Deck Snowskates\\". Around the same time, snowboard manufacturer Burton Snowboards released the \\"Snowdeck\\". Burton has since stopped making snowskates. There are many bidecking skate communities in the world. Different bidecks are tailored to a different style of riding. Longer bidecks are favored for mountain snowskating, and shorter bidecks are favored for tricks and stunts. Current Bideck snowskate manufacturers are Hovland, Parole Boards, Squampton Snowskates (eco-friendly, made with hemp), Harfang, Ralston, Pioneer, Fuse, florilda powderskate, 0910, Minus-7, Landyachtz, Chiller, LibTech and Boyd Hill.  4x4  The least common snowskate, 4x4 snowskates, provide the most skateboard like feel. They have four small skis, each replacing a wheel, and are generally a little fatter and longer than a normal skateboard.  Powderskate  Powderskates are the most surf-like snowskate. They are usually longer and have a larger surface area to keep you afloat as it is used in deep powder. There are two varieties; single and bi-deck. The single deck is only for use in powder, and provides the most surf-like feel, whereas the bi-deck provides more leverage, and can be used on and off the powder.

History Seventeen pilots attended the first organized meeting of the \\"Testy Test Pilots Society\\" on 29 September 1955. This name was to be short-lived, however, as it was changed to The Society of Experimental Test Pilots at the second meeting on 13 October 1955. The first officers of the society were instated on October 25, 1955, and consisted of Ray Tenhoff, President; Scott Crossfield, Executive Adviser; Dick Johnson, Vice-President; Joe Ozier, Secretary; Lou Everett, Treasurer; and Al Blackburn, Legal Officer. Once the organization and bylaws were established, the society incorporated in the state of California on April 12, 1956. The first Awards Banquet was held on October 4, 1957, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. It was at the second such banquet, however, that the tradition of the Iven C. Kincheloe Award began. This annual award honors the member who has done the most proficient test work during the previous year. James Gannett of Boeing and Joseph John \\"Tym\\" Tymczyszyn of the Civil Aeronautics Administration won the first Kincheloe Award for their work toward certification of America's first turbojet airliner' the Boeing 707. They have been followed each year by the most notable contributors to aviation history. As of December 31, 2019, the Society had 2,449 members from various countries. Publications The society publishes a quarterly known as Cockpit that contains technical articles on flight testing. In addition to Cockpit, the society publishes the proceedings of the annual symposium in Los Angeles to provide a permanent record of flight test progress reports. A periodic newsletter is also provided to members. Conferences The Society holds a number of conferences annually: *Los Angeles Symposium and Banquet *San Diego Symposium *East Coast Symposium *Northwest Symposium *European Symposium *Southeast Symposium *Central Symposium *Great Lakes Symposium *Southwest Symposium *Flight Test Safety Workshop Awards The Society annually presents a number of awards to recognize notable members of the flight test community.

Today, he is best known as the founder of the Calgary Stampede in Alberta, Canada. He was married to famed cowgirl, Florence LaDue. Weadick was the first to be inducted in the Builder category in the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame.  Calgary Stampede  In 1912, Weadick travelled to Calgary, where he met with H.C. McMullen, a livestock agent for the Canadian Pacific Railway. The two of them put together a program for a frontier show. They envisioned a cowboy championship along with a tribute to the Old West. Weadick gained financing from the Big Four: George Lane, owner of the Bar U Ranch; two other wealthy ranchers, Patrick Burns and A. E. Cross; and A. J. McLean, provincial secretary. He staged the first Calgary Stampede September 2‚Äì7, 1912, when ranchers and farmers had finished the harvesting and would be free to attend. Weadick arranged for 200 head of Mexican steers, 200 bucking steers, and wild horses to be brought in from the ranches around Calgary. In order to entice top quality competitors, $20,000 in championship money and world championship titles were offered. The prize money was about four times the closest competition, causing riders from across North America to arrive in the 1912 Stampede. In 1919, Weadick and Calgary Industrial Exhibition manager, E. L. Richardson, agreed to combine the rodeo events with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition and, in 1923, Weadick and Richardson co-founded the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede as an annual event. In 1912, Indigenous peoples were not allowed to celebrate their cultures on their own reserves because of Indian Act laws and regulations. The Stampede was one of the only places they were welcomed to participate and celebrate their traditions publicly because of a special agreement Guy Weadick and the Calgary Stampede made with the government. Indian Village is organized by volunteers on the Stampede's Indian Events committee, Stampede employees and the tipi families who camp at the Village during the Stampede. There is constant consultation about the name of the Village and if it should be changed. The tipi owners have indicated that Indian Village is a place and a name with great historical significance and honours the role of Guy Weadick and the relationship with the Stampede throughout the 20th century.  Later years  Following on the success of the Calgary Stampede, Guy Weadick continued promoting his own personal Old West shows (outside Calgary). He continued running the Stampede for 20 years after its initial creation. His next appearance at the Stampede was to appear in the parade in 1952. He died on December 13, 1953. The Calgary Stampede Guy Weadick Award, created in 1969, was named after him. He was inducted into the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in the Builder category on July 12, 1982. He was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 1976.

It's also used by massage therapists, athletic trainers, osteopaths, and physicians A 2011 literature review indicates that placebo is one of likely many potentially relevant mechanisms through which manual therapy improves clinical outcomes related to musculoskeletal pain conditions.  Definitions  Irvin Korr, J. S. Denslow and colleagues did the original body of research on manual therapy. Korr described it as the \\"Application of an accurately determined and specifically directed manual force to the body, in order to improve mobility in areas that are restricted; in joints, in connective tissues or in skeletal muscles.\\" According to the Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy Description of Advanced Specialty Practice manual therapy is defined as a clinical approach utilizing specific hands-on techniques, including but not limited to manipulation/mobilization, used by the physical therapist to diagnose and treat soft tissues and joint structures for the purpose of modulating pain; increasing range of motion (ROM); reducing or eliminating soft tissue inflammation; inducing relaxation; improving contractile and non-contractile tissue repair, extensibility, and/or stability; facilitating movement; and improving function. A consensus study of US chiropractors defined manual therapy (generally known as the \\"chiropractic adjustment\\" in the profession) as \\"Procedures by which the hands directly contact the body to treat the articulations and/or soft tissues.\\"  Use and method  In Western Europe, North America and Australasia, manual therapy is usually practiced by members of specific health care professions (e.g. Chiropractors, Occupational Therapists, Osteopaths, Osteopathic physicians, Physiotherapists/Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists and Physiatrists). However, some lay practitioners (not members of a structured profession), such as bonesetters also provide some forms of manual therapy. A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health focused on who used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), what was used, and why it was used in the United States by adults during 2002. Massage was the fifth most commonly use CAM in the United States in 2007. = Techniques = * Myofascial Therapy targets the muscle and fascial systems, promotes flexibility and mobility of the body's connective tissues. It is said to mobilize adhesions and reduce severity/sensitivity of scarring. A critical analysis finds that the relevance of fascia to therapy doubtful. * Massage may be used as part of a treatment. Proponents claim this may reduce inflammation. Science writer Paul Ingraham notes that there is no evidence to support the claim. * Friction massage is said to increase mobilization of adhesions between fascial layers, muscles, compartments and other soft tissues. They are thought to create an inflammatory response and instigate focus to injured areas. A 2012 systematic review found that no additional benefit was incurred from the inclusion of deep tissue friction massage in a therapeutic regimen, although the conclusions were limited by the small sample sizes in available randomized clinical trials. * Soft Tissue Technique is firm, direct pressure to relax hypertonic muscles and stretch tight fascial structures. A 2015 review concluded that the Technique is ineffective for lower back pain, and the quality of research testing its effectiveness is poor. * Trigger Point techniques claim to address Myofascial Trigger points, though the explanation of how this works is controversial = Stretching = From the main article's effectiveness section: *Apart from before running, stretching does not appear to reduce risk of injury during exercise. *Some evidence shows that pre- exercise stretching may increase range of movement. *The Mayo Clinic advises against bouncing, and to hold for thirty seconds. They suggest warming up before stretching or stretching post-exercise. = Taping = Manual therapy practitioners often use therapeutic taping to relieve pressure on injured soft tissue, alter muscle firing patterns or prevent re-injury. Some techniques are designed to enhance lymphatic fluid exchange. After a soft tissue injury to muscles or tendons from sports activities, over exertion or repetitive strain injury swelling may impede blood flow to the area and slow healing. Elastic taping methods may relieve pressure from swollen tissue and enhance circulation to the injured area. According to the medical and skeptical community there is no known benefit from this technique and it is a pseudoscience.  Styles of manual therapy  There are many different styles of manual therapy. It is a fundamental feature of ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and some forms of New Age alternative medicine as well as being used by mainstream medical practitioners.

Writer Len Wein and artist Jim Starlin created the first version of the character, who debuted in DC Comics Presents #27 (Nov. 1980). Writer Peter J. Tomasi and artist Scot Eaton created the second version, who first appeared in Showcase '95 #8 (Sept. 1995) as an infant. Debuting in the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Mongul has been featured in other DC Comics-endorsed products such as animated television series; video games; a direct-to-DVD film, and merchandise such as action figures and trading cards.  Publication history  Mongul debuted in the title DC Comics Presents and was created by writer Len Wein and artist Jim Starlin. Starlin often receives credit as creator of the character, but Wein in an interview stated: \\"Well, [Mongul] had Starlin visuals, but he was my creation\\". Wein said he conceived Mongul specifically as a villain to physically challenge Superman. Fictional character biography =Bronze Age (1980-1985)= Mongul was the ruler of his own alien race until a revolution occurred, and he was exiled into outer space.DC Comics Presents #28 In his first appearance, Mongul kidnaps Superman's friends (Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Steve Lombard), threatening to kill them unless the hero brings him the key that can activate the artificial planet Warworld. After Superman retrieves the key, and is forced to fight the Martian Manhunter who is protecting it,DC Comics Presents #27 Mongul activates Warworld. Psychically linked with its controls, Mongul tries to destroy Superman and Supergirl. Mongul is ultimately rendered unconscious by a massive mental strain caused from using its controls, but manages to escape before the heroes destroy Warworld. Mongul then tries to conquer Throneworld, the home planet of Prince Gavyn, one of the heroes who have used the name Starman. Mongul murders Gavyn's sister and forces Gavyn's lover into marrying him in order to usurp the throne of the empire for himself. He uses Throneworld's planet-destroying weapon to blackmail other planets into obedience. Superman arrives and battles Mongul, while Starman disables the weapon. Mongul retreats.DC Comics Presents #36 Now wanting revenge on Superman, Mongul kills a Controller and steals the Sun-Eater to devour the Earth's Sun. While the Justice League of America and Legion of Super-Heroes battle Mongul, Superman finally defeats him as the Legion destroys the Sun-Eater.DC Comics Presents #43 Mongul eventually attacks Superman on his birthday and ensnares him with a Black Mercy, an alien plant that feeds off a victim's \\"bio-aura\\" while rendering the victim incapable of fighting back, giving them their own perfect \\"dream world\\" in return. In the end, thanks to Batman, Robin and Wonder Woman, Mongul becomes the plant's next victim and dreams of himself as ruler of the universe.Superman Annual #11: \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\" =Modern Age (1985-present)= After the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters to update them for contemporary audiences. The original stories involving Mongul were no longer in continuity, and the character was reintroduced as the ruler of Warworld, a space empire where Mongul entertains the citizens with gladiatorial games. Mongul's ship captures a dying Superman, who was floating adrift in outer space after he exiled himself from Earth, and Mongul decides to use him in the games, but Superman joins forces with the alien warrior and Mongul's champion Draaga and makes Mongul flee. Mongul is then persuaded via torture to serve the Cyborg Superman to gain vengeance on Superman and to try to turn the Earth into another Warworld. In the process, Green Lantern Hal Jordan's home, Coast City, is destroyed, which leads to Jordan joining Superman and his allies to defeat Mongul. After his defeat, Mongul is imprisoned in a prison for intergalactic criminals, only to break out during a riot. His first target is Green Lantern; he learns that the one whom he faces, Kyle Rayner, is not the one he fought earlier. Mongul is defeated when Kyle's ring shows no weakness to yellow. Mongul is re-imprisoned. Mongul breaks out of the lunar penal colony, killing everyone there, including prisoners who are left to die in the vacuum of space. His ship is almost wrecked and he is near death; he is teleported to a planet and saved. In return, he takes over the planet and ends up being left alone as the inhabitants prefer dying due to a virus than his tyranny, until he ends up finding two babies immune to the virus (a story started in Showcase '95 #7, with the two babies appearing in Showcase '95 #8; reprinted in DC Universe Special: Superman #1). Mongul is later defeated on Earth by Wally West (the Flash) when Mongul tries to unearth a starship left from one of the Darkstars' enemies underneath Keystone City. The Flash easily defeats Mongul. The Flash seemingly uses Mongul to test his new upgraded powers. During the battle, Wally is only hit one time by the giant, hulking Mongul. Flash uses his super speed to quickly confuse and defeat Mongul and has him imprisoned in the Slab, a prison for supervillains (Flash #102, reprinted in DC Universe Special: Superman #1). During the Underworld Unleashed crossover event, the demon-lord Neron offers various supervillains (including Mongul) enhanced power in exchange for their souls, all by lighting a carved black candle. Mongul's pride causes him to decline the offer and threaten Neron. In response, Neron beats Mongul to death for his defiance, taking his soul in the process.Underworld Unleashed #1 (November 1995) Son of Mongul Mongul's son, also named Mongul, appears to assist and train Superman, in preparation for the arrival of Imperiex.Superman (vol. 2) #153 (February 2000) This Mongul seems to be more powerful than his father. He appears to have been killed later in the Our Worlds at War crossover, but returns during Infinite Crisis after learning from Despero that the Justice League has apparently been destroyed. His intention is to loot their Watchtower headquarters but he ends up fighting Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. He is almost killed by Wonder Woman before escaping via a working teleporter.Infinite Crisis #1 The teleportation transports him to Earth, to menace Hal Jordan, the newly returned Green Lantern, by using the Black Mercy on him and the Green Arrow.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #7 In the meantime, he seeks his sister, Mongal, to settle family squabbles. The heroes break free and use a teleporter to transport Mongul and Mongal to their home planet. Stating family to be a weakness, Mongul decapitates Mongal with a single blow to her head.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #8 Mongul's origins depicts him as a child who wanted to be like his father. He made journeys and he watched digital renderings where his father fought against Superman and his allies and the destruction of Coast City. He copies his father's actions when he encounters a group of aliens whose spaceship crashes on Arkymandryte, turning them into his slaves. Mongul's father returns, and discovering his son's slaves, he kills the aliens and tells him only one being on the planet is worthy of adoration.Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #1 Mongul receives a Yellow Power Ring after breaking a dying Sinestro Corps member's neckGreen Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #19 (a later promotional image shows Mongul with the Yellow ring as well a Green Lantern Corps ring).Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #20 Mongul offers the Sinestro Corps inductees a choice: to serve him or die. He removes the ring from each one who refuses, and at one point had gained an extra five rings. He then attacks Arisia and Sodam Yat with Black Mercy plants, and takes them prisoner.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #23Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #24 He uses his ring to send thousands of Black Mercy seeds, which he had genetically engineered to bring the victims' greatest fears to life, instead of their dreams, to several unsuspecting planets. In a confrontation with several members of the Green Lantern Corps, Mongul is defeated when the fly- like Lantern Bzzd flies through his eye, and he is thrown down to the Black Mercies' planet. He is last seen buried in soil, being used as food by the Black Mercies.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #25Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #26 However, he soon breaks free and escapes the planet, while keeping his rings and his right arm. His left arm had been severed in the process, but, through the power of his rings, Mongul is able to control and direct it.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #27 He attacks a nearby ship to get food for himself, killing the husband of the pilot. This inadvertently causes the woman to become the first recruit of the Star Sapphires, the violet Power Ring having been drawn to her by the void in her heart created by her loss.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #29 Mongul uses his left arm to invade the planet Daxam and establish it as the new homeworld for his faction of the Sinestro Corps under his command.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #31 However, he is challenged for the leadership by Arkillo.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #33 Defeating him in single combat, Mongul pulls out Arkillo's tongue and wears it as a necklace. In the process, he gains the loyalty of the faction of the Sinestro Corps loyal to Arkillo and complete rule over the planet Daxam, but draws on himself the attentions of Arisia and Sodam Yat, the Daxamite host for the Ion Entity. Upon the arrival of Arisia and Yat, several members of the Sinestro Corps are swiftly defeated and killed by Yat, until his Superman-like powers fade under Daxam's red sun. Despite his power loss and Mongul's incredible strength, Yat does battle with him, using the Ion power to briefly launch Mongul into space, before entering Daxam's sun and transforming it from red to yellow, granting all Daxamites superpowers.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #34Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #36 The Daxamite's overwhelming attack forces Mongul to have the Sinestro Corps abandon Daxam, with the despot planning to make a different planet their home base.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #37Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #38 Sinestro regains his Corps (Green Lantern (vol. 4) #46, art by Doug Mahnke and Christian Alamy) Mongul takes the Sinestro Corps to Korugar, Sinestro's homeworld, having the inhabitants strung up along the streets. He also decides to rename the Yellow Lanterns as \\"the Mongul Corps\\", after himself.Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #39 Soon after, Sinestro is brought to Korugar and confronts Mongul. First, using an override built into Mongul's rings, Sinestro defeats him, thus reclaiming the Sinestro Corps. Then, he imprisons Mongul in the Corps' Central Power Battery, intending to kill him once the Black Lantern Corps is dealt with.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #46 The New 52 In The New 52, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, Mongul is once again reintroduced as lord and master of the planetary siege engine Warworld. In his introduction, he is laying waste to a planet he is poised to conquer as he brought a resisting general aboard his vessel in order to show him the devastation of his homeworld just before decapitating him and adding his remains to a trophy room on Warworld.Green Lantern (vol. 5) #23.3 Mongul makes a brief appearance in the Superman: Doomed story arc. He manages to escape the Phantom Zone alongside similarly powerful villains such as Non, and prepares to attack Earth. However, upon learning that Brainiac has arrived on Earth, Mongul, stricken with fear, immediately heads back into the Phantom Zone.Pak, Greg (w). Action Comics (vol. 2) #34 (August 2014), DC Comics. Wonder Woman later enters the Phantom Zone and traps him in her Lasso of Truth, before ordering Mongul's Warworld to attack Brainiac's ship. Sometime after his imprisonment, Mongul would escape the Phantom Zone with Warworld in tow, eventually setting his sights on revenge against Sinestro and his Fear Corps for prior injuries long past by seeking to lure him out using Black Mercies on Korugarian refugees, then draining his ring to uselessness through leftover technologies of the old universal survivor Relic, which he had integrated into Warworld's systems.Sinestro #9 Mongul would use him as a bargaining chip to call the rest of his Corpsmen to do battle over Warworld to rescue their leader so he could cow them back into his services again while seeking to coax the Emotional Entity Parallax from within his hated rival out into the open, all to truly take command of the Sinestro Corps once again.Sinestro #10 His plan was going without a hitch so far, even with the untimely arrival of Bekka of the New Gods lending much needed assistance. But the tables were turned when the Apex League, a team of mercenaries whom he had enlisted, eventually turned on him at Sinestro's suggestion after Mongul's prisoner reversed the energy siphon. Afterwards, he would entrap his assailant in scrap metal lined with yellow ring fragments before jettisoning him into deep space, a bright and shiny lure the Pale Vicors would be drawn to. The interstellar warlord would resurface as an enslaved thrall of the Pailing when his new masters attacked the Earth at their lord marshal's clarion call. Now in the service of anti-emotion, Mongul had returned to battle Sinestro more powerful than ever, while aiding in the subjugation of humanity.Sinestro #18 The battle would rage and Sinestro would recruit many amongst the planet into his Corps to defend it; eventually Black Adam, yet another addition to the Yellow Lanterns, would cast him out of the fight just long enough for his brother in arms to deliver the killing blow to Mongul and the Pailing's leader, the Pale Bishop.Sinestro #20 In the aftermath of the battle, Sinestro ceded control of his Corps to his daughter Soranik due to his injuries, while the Sinestro Corpsmen helped Earth rebuild. Mongul would stir from his zombified state hellbent on getting Sinestro for feeding him to the Pail Vicors. Seeing as he was surrounded by Manhunters, however, he opted a hasty retreat to Earth in order to bide his time instead.Sinestro #21 DC Rebirth Mongul appears as a main villain in Trinity, where his use of The Green causes Poison Ivy to capture Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman and causes them to undergo hallucinations of their own childhoods. The three are eventually able to reduce Mongol's influence over his other world. Mongul is briefly a member of a new version of the Superman Revenge Squad, also consisting of General Zod, Metallo, Cyborg Superman, Eradicator, and Blanque. After Superman is temporarily blinded, they are defeated when Lex Luthor, Supergirl, Superwoman, Kong Kenan, and Steel come to Superman's aid. Action Comics (vol. 3) #979-984 Mongul later escapes prison Dark Nights: Metal #1and somehow traps the Justice League inside of an intergalactic arena around the time they are investigating Barbatos.Dark Days: The Casting They construct a mecha out of Mongul's creatures and frighten him away, but upon returning to Earth discover that it has been sacked by Barbatos. Powers and abilities During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Mongul was stronger than Superman and almost totally invulnerable to harm. Superman defeated him by foiling his schemes, but only once defeated Mongul in hand-to-hand combat. Even then, Superman fell unconscious immediately afterward. Mongul also demonstrated the ability to teleport; limited telepathy and telekinesis; and could project blasts of potent force via his eyes, hands, or chest. The character also used technology to shrink his enemies and place them in dimensional-inversion cubes designed to prevent escape by warping their interior reality and absorbing any power used against them from within. The Modern Age Mongul started off with less power than the Bronze Age version but was still a formidable foe and a capable match up against Superman on multiple occasions, although slightly weaker. Mongul was able to resist half-power Kryptonian heat vision at point- blank range and, thanks to his enhanced musculature, was incredibly resilient to physical harm. Because of his impressive muscle structure, Mongul was also incredibly fast, and able to push himself forward at high speed while running or able to leap several miles into the air by his powerful legs. He also had his chest cannon with which he could fire potent energy blasts that could stagger or kill even Superman. So formidable a foe was he that Mongul could not only trade blows with Kryptonians but repeatedly battle Green Lanterns on a regular basis, especially given that his natural yellow skin gave him protection against their rings. He was still outclassed, though, by individuals of greater capability (be it physical or technological in nature), such as Hank Henshaw (before and after his acquisition of Superman's genetic template) and the demon Neron (who killed him with his bare hands). His progeny Mongul II, however, showed himself to either be on equal footing or in greater strength than even his father. Having demonstrated enough might for defeating DC Universe heavy-hitters like Wonder Woman (Infinite Crisis #1 (December 2005)), along with killing members of both the Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps in his pursuit of power rings. He was strong enough to decapitate and kill his sister Mongal in one blow. When acquiring his first Yellow Lantern ring, he decided to learn about its potential for 96 hours, hinting at a methodical mindset mostly absent from Yellow Lanterns. Mongul II also battled Superman, leading to his defeat after both delivered many blows, leading to Superman unleashing a massive combination attack required to overpower this villain (Superman (vol. 2) #152 (January 2000)). This battle displayed him having an endurance to massive blows from a being as powerful as Superman. After having obtained several Qwardian Power Rings, he showed a rather avid usage of their power for numerous effects (i.e., having used them along with his father's innate knowledge of the Black Mercy to modify the plant's parasitic behavioral patterns, inducing frightful mirages over happy fantasies; create and manipulate fear-driven constructs powerful enough to batter an Ion-empowered Sodom Yat; and reattach destroyed or removed limbs or body parts via precise fear energy material rearrangement). In the new universe Mongul has been radically re-imagined from being the formidable adversary he once was during the Bronze-Silver Ages. Now back in control over Warworld, he again started cutting a bloody swath across the universe, conquering planet after planet with his cosmic dreadnaught. When he makes his way to Earth, he showcases extreme levels of super strength and resilience as he gets into a colossal battle between Superman and an empowered Batman who, at the time, had Kryptonian-like power sets.batman/Superman #7 Kal-El once stated him to be about as strong as Darkseid; this is proven true in a number of cases where he showed his might by fighting off an entire brigade of Yellow Lanterns backed by a New God within their ranks. He still retains his chest cannon, which can still blow away multiple personages in one blast, as well as heat vision to incinerate his enemies. This new Mongul is tougher, faster and more powerful than ever, easily able to take on individuals or groups as powerful as Lantern Corpsmen or even New Gods, as well as survive virtually unscathed. In the event that he does suffer from critical abrasion; Mongul also has a slight healing factor with which to help him recover almost from anything, the limits of which were never probed.Sinestro #9-10 He even showcased the natural capacity of flight with or without assisted propulsion more than once. For a time, he was also part of the Sinestro Corps, having access to all that it entailed; i.e., the ability to create fear-based energy constructs, gaining power from the fears of others and acquiring a power battery with which to recharge his ring. After he had been deposed by Sinestro, who later requisitioned Warworld for his own cause, Mongul would end up in the services of the Pale Vicors, an anti-emotional sect which razed planets of their resources and their inhabitants by nullifying their ability to feel and/or empathize before harvesting the targeted worlds resources.Sinestro #1 Having been given enormous power at the cost of his own individual freedom, the Pailing made Mongul stronger beyond imagining. With all new powers and abilities which allowed him to match and overpower the likes of Sinestro and a Yellow Ring-empowered Black Adam with ease, he could even singlehandedly stalemate the very firepower of Warworld itself; which had been commandeered at the time by the Sinestro Corpsman Ranx.Sinestro #18-20 As a Pail Vicor, Mongul possessed all the natural powers which came with it; armed with his lance he could emit a form of apathetic force which negated the powers of the emotional spectrum, giving him similar construct forming abilities akin to a Lantern Ring, only angled to use other sentient beings' emotional anguish to drive the emotion out of them, rendering the afflicted unfeeling, empty shells of who and/or what they used to be. He could also use its power to fly and emit energy blasts with the same energy negating effects as the protective aura which shrouds all the Pailing. In other media =Television= * Mongul appears in the animated television series Justice League and Justice League Unlimited voiced by Eric Roberts. In it, he is the dictator of 'War World', holding gladiatorial-type games to keep the masses appeased with his rule, being considered the most powerful being on the planet, having never lost a match, but more than willing to resort to trickery to win. He is defeated by Superman and Draaga, and appears later in Justice League Unlimited when the \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\" story is adapted into an episode of the same name, albeit with Robin being written out. Mongul is defeated in the same way as in the original story, and the defeat remains his ultimate fate in the DC Animated Universe, as he never appears again. * Mongul II appeared in Batman: The Brave and the Bold voiced by Gary Anthony Williams.

After Wonder Woman apprehended the Joker, Superman manages to defeat Mongul. When the Joker's laughing gas bomb blows up, Superman was able to redirect the gas to Mongul's ship, by breathing it all in on Earth, flying to Mongul's ship and exhaling it all out. As everyone on Mongul's ship laughs uncontrollably, Mongul also laughs while stating his hatred towards Superman. =Film= * Mongul appears in the direct-to-DVD film Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, voiced by Bruce Timm.

With its Resident Performing Ensemble, OYR creates original theatrical works each year for its home audiences and also hosts The High Performance Rodeo, Calgary‚Äôs International Festival of the Arts. OYR was founded in 1982, operating as a collective until coalescing into the OYR Performing Ensemble circa 1987-8. In its history the company has created almost 80 full-length original productions. Ensemble personnel have remained relatively consistent since then, and OYR established a professional administrative staff. The company‚Äôs philosophy and practice has been influenced by contemporary dance, the Artist run centre movement, the Punk subculture, and the do-it-yourself creed. In 1987, OYR produced the Secret Elevator Experimental Performance Festival, later renamed the High Performance Rodeohttps://www.hprodeo.ca/ in 1988. The festival has grown annually in audience, venues and impact, surpassing 10,000 attendees in 2006 and 16,000 in 2009, it now reaches over 20,000 audience members every year. The Rodeo features theatre, dance, music and multimedia presentations from across Canada and abroad. Artists presented in recent years range from hundreds of emerging artists to Philip Glass, Catalyst Theatre, Electric Company Theatre, Compagnie Marie Chouinard, Laurie Anderson, Andy Jones, members of The Kids In the Hall, Les Deux Mondes, Peggy Baker, Daniel MacIvor, and the OYR Ensemble itself. His Excellency Jean-Daniel Lafond was the Rodeo‚Äôs Honorary Patron from 2008-2009. He and Governor General Micha√´lle Jean attended performances and hosted three ‚ÄúArt Matters‚Äù community forums as part of the festival.

The term has been explored in post-structuralism as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts. Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is Julia Kristeva's, pursued particularly in her 1980 work Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection. Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva calls one's \\"corporeal reality\\", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is Self and what is Other. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death. The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what \\"is not me\\". Kristeva's concept of abjection is used commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in misogyny, homophobia, and genocide. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan. In literary critical theory Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist Louis- Ferdinand C√©line),Geoffrey Brereton, A Short History of French Literature (1954), p. 246. and of the subject as grounded in \\"filth\\" (e.g., psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan),Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (1994), p. 258. Julia Kristeva developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reasonthe communal consensus that underpins a social order.Julia Kristeva, Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection (1982)m p. 65. The \\"abject\\" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an object and the concept of the subject, representing taboo elements of the self barely separated off in a liminal space.Childers/Hentzi, p. 308. Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subjecta part of oneselfand objectsomething that exists independently of oneselfthere resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejectedthe abject. It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: \\"It is thus not the lack of cleanliness or health that causes abjection but what disturbs identity, system, and order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules. The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite\\".Kristeva, \\"Powers of Horror\\", p. 4; Guberman, \\"Julia Kristeva Interviews\\", (1996). Since the abject is situated outside the symbolic order, being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpsean object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'. Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the superegothe representative of culture, of the symbolic order:Kristeva, p. 15. in Kristeva's aphorism, \\"To each ego its object, to each superego its abject\\".Kristeva, p. 2. From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity. Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through \\"language as a common and universal law\\". We use rituals, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, The Horror Reader (2000), p. 64. The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of the uncanny, the concept of something being \\"un-home-like\\", or foreign, yet familiar.Childers/Hentzi, p. 1 The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being \\"foreign\\": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanninessWinifred Menninghaus, Disgust (2003), p. 374.creates a cognitive dissonance. =Cases= * Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work The Thief's Journal (Journal du Voleur) by French author Jean Genet, a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an existentialist form of 'sainthood'Gene A. Plunka, The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet (1992), p. 49. * The film Alien (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in horror and science fiction monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.Barbara Creed, The Monstrous Feminine (1993), p. 16. Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the primal scene, and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.Creed, p. 17 and p. 26‚Äì9. *The 1990s-era Australian literary genre grunge lit often focuses on young adult characters with \\"abject\\" bodies Gelder K. and Salzman P. After the celebration: Australian fiction 1989‚Äì2007. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2009. that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in Andrew McGahan's book Praise, Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes' Drift Street, Edward Berridge's The Lives of the Saints, and Praise \\"...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other\\" and \\"opening up\\" new \\"limnal [boundary] spaces\\" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored. Brooks states that the marginalized characters in The Lives of the Saints, Drift Street and Praise) are able to stay in \\"shit creek\\" (an undesirable setting or situation) and \\"diver[t]... flows\\" of these \\"creeks\\", thus claiming their rough settings' \\"limnality\\" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own \\"abjection\\" (having \\"abject bodies\\" with health problems, disease, etc.) as \\"sites of symbolic empowerment and agency\\". In social critical theory \\"Abjection\\" is often used to describe the state of often-marginalized groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, and poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).Sexual Outcasts. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000). The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit. =In organizational studies= Organizational theory literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, \\"States of Abjection\\" (2013), p. 1279‚Äì80. In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms \\"the one by whom the abject exists,\\" or \\"the deject\\" people.\\"Powers of Horror\\", p. 8. Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the semiotic, both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a \\"zone of inhabitability\\" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms. One such method is that of \\"collective instruction,\\" which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient \\"dark side\\" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.Sorenson, \\"Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side\\" (2014), p. 281‚Äì3. This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is createdfor example, a corporation's or organization's mission statement. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This spun meaning developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory. Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.Risq, \\"States of Abjection\\" (2013), p. 1279. Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy. =In sociological studies= The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.Oliver, \\"Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva\\" (2010). Imogen Tyler\\"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain\\" (2013), p. 599 sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of peoplemostly minority groupsas revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion. Exploration has also been done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances\\"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling\\" (2014), p. 198‚Äì200. emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'an object that can be ignoredor that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject. In psychotherapy By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, \\"Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility\\" (2014), p. 1343. Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the otheractual, imagined or fantasizedis central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body partit has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a wholewhether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.Schott & Sordengaard, \\"School bullying: New theories in context\\" (2014). For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities. Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.Dryden, Ussher & Perz, \\"Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility\\" (2014); Parker, \\"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder\\" (2014); Schott & Sordengaard, \\"School bullying: New theories in context\\" (2014). This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In art The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which \\"explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety, particularly referencing the body and bodily functions.\\" Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the Dada movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by Antonin Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty. The Whitney Museum in New York City identified abject art in 1993.Foster, Hal. \\"Obscene, abject, traumatic.\\" October (1996): 107‚Äì124. It was preceded by the films and performances of the Viennese actionists, in particular, Hermann Nitsch, whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the Orgien-Mysterien-Theater. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the Viennese Actionists, Gunter Brus, who began as a painter, and Otto Muehl collaborated on performances. The performances of Gunter Brus involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. Rudolf Schwarzkogler is known for his photos dealing with the abject. In the late 1960s, performance art become popular in New York, including by Carolee Schneemann. Mary Kelly, Genesis P. Orridge and GG Allin did this type of art. In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the Powers of Horror, the title of a book by Julia Kristeva, led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including Ron Athey, Franko B, Lennie Lee and Kira O' Reilly. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsisan impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.Kristeva, \\"Powers of Horror\\" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, \\"'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny\\" (2011); Oliver, \\"Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva\\" (2009). In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists Zhu Yu and Yang Zhichao. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including Louise Bourgeois, Helen Chadwick, Gilbert and George, Robert Gober, Kiki Smith and Jake and Dinos Chapman who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.\\"Abject Art\\" Retrieved on 2010-11-09. Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, Joel Peter Witkin, whose book Love and Redemption and Andres Serrano whose piece entitled Piss Christ caused a scandal in 1989. In 2015, Welsh poet RJ Arkhipov wrote a series of poems using his own blood as ink to protest the men who have sex with men blood donor controversy in the United Kingdom. The poems were later published by Zuleika as Visceral: The Poetry of Blood alongside photographs in which the author uses his own blood as an artistic medium.

He had first seen Ramakrishna in the house of Dinanath Bose at a very young age.The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 313 Ramakrishna did not want him to be over orthodox and therefore introduced him to Narendranath Dutta (later Vivekananda). Gangadhar was favourably impressed with Narendranath and became devoted to him, a devotion which lasted throughout his life and which later prompted him to take up service as the primary work over spiritual practices. During his visits to Dakshineswar, Gangadhar received instructions on meditation from Ramakrishna.Swami Akhandananda: Service as Worship, by Swami Devarajananda, Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 133 = Pre monastic days = Gangadhar's father found a job for Gangadhar in a merchant's office. Gangadhar worked there a few days and then gave it up. He then fully engaged himself in spiritual disciplines and service to the master. Gangadhar served Ramakrishna during the illness of the latter. After the death of Ramakrishna, when the Baranagar Math was formed by Narendranath and other brother disciples, Gangadhar renounced his family life and embraced a life of travel with consent from his family and set foot for the Himalayas. Steeped in Vedanta and his own experience, his mind ever pined to be absorbed in the bliss of the Himalayan solitude. In 1887, after visiting Kedarnath and Badrinath, he travelled to Tibet where he lived in Lhasa and elsewhere for three years, returning to India in 1890.The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 315 Gangadhar's entire travel account is recorded in his book Smriti-Katha (From Holy Wanderings to The Service of God in Man). He travelled hundreds of miles in the mountains of the Himalayas without carrying any money or extra clothing. = Life as a Monk =  Travels  Gangadhar took his monastic vow in 1890, in Baranagar Math and in the presence of SwamiVivekananda, and was given the name of \\"Akhandananda\\" (Akhanda - undifferentiated, ananda - bliss, one who finds supreme bliss in the undifferentiated nature of the Truth). After his return, he had frequent correspondence with Vivekananda, then at Ghazipur, who induced him to join him in travelling in some places of the Himalayas because of the latter's experience and familiarity in those terrains. Accordingly, Akhandananda came to Baranagore monastery, and after spending a few happy months with his brother-disciples, sharing his experiences with them, he set out in July 1890, with Vivekananda on a pilgrimage to the Himalayas.Biography of Akhandananda on the RMIC site Visiting important places on the way they reached Almora, but the illness of one or the other plagued their journey and they returned via Tehri to Dehra Dun, from where Akhandananda proceeded to Meerut for treatment. Vivekananda also joined him in Meerut and they met some other brother disciples. After five months of association Vivekananda left them and Akhandananda followed him surreptitiously, going from one province to another in his search, but everywhere he narrowly missed meeting him. Finally he met Vivekananda again in Kutch where Swami Vivekananda entreated him to follow a separate course. Accordingly, Akhandananda continued his pilgrimage separately.The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 316  Intellectual Pursuits  During his days of wandering in the Himalayas, he studied Avadhuta Gita at Srinagar in Garhwal. In 1891, while resting at Etawah, he spent most of his time reading the Mahabhashya, Patanjali's voluminous commentary on Panini's Sanskrit grammar, as well as Sridhara Swami‚Äôs commentary on the Bhagavadgita. In Jamnagar in 1892, he studied the Charaka-Sushruta Samhita with the help of the Sanskrit lexicon Shabdartha Chandrika Kosha and also Shukla Yajur Veda. In Udaipur he read the Vedantic text of Panchadasi. He also learned Hindi grammar from Bhasha Bhaskara, to correct his Hindi pronunciation. In Indore, he completed a reading of the entire Valmiki Ramayana over a period of eighteen days. Later in Mahula he undertook a critical study of the Yogavasishtha Ramayana.Akhandananda: Service as Worship, Devarajananda, Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 133  Relationship with Vivekananda and Sarada Devi  Akhandananda was an ardent follower of Vivekananda, who called him lovingly as Ganges. He was also devoted to Sarada Devi. When hard work in Murshidabad took a toll on his health, she had him brought to Calcutta for treatment and took special care of him.  Final Years  Akhandananda became the vice president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission in 1925 and the third president after the demise of Swami Shivananda in 1934. He initiated a number of people after assuming office. However he continued to stay at Sargachhi. Akhandananda also initiated Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, the second sarsanghachalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He participated in the celebration of the Birth Centenary of Ramakrishna in 1936 in Calcutta. In February 1937 he fell ill and was brought to Calcutta. He died in Belur Math on 7 February 1937.  Service  Alambazar Math, 1896 (farewell to Swami Abhedananda leaving for the US)(from left) standing: Swami Adbhutananda, Yogananda, Abhedananda, Trigunatitananda, Turiyananda, Nirmalananda, and Niranjanananda; sitting: Swamis Subodhananda, Brahmananda (on chair), and Akhandananda Akhandananda was the first monk of the Ramakrishna order, who gave shape to the cherished desire of Vivekananda to begin rural development work‚Äîeven before the Mission was established. The distressing sorrows and suffering of the masses pulled him down to the plains, and to them he became a harbinger of peace and succour. Sacrificing his Himalayan bliss, he chose to be with poor. Akhandananda practised till the very end of his life his Master's call: Worship jiva as Shiva. He was one of the pillars of the Ramakrishna Movement's service activities. His experience as a wandering monk, like those of Vivekananda moved him to take steps to remove the distress and misery of the masses. Vivekananda's encouraging letter from America which was sent as a reply to Akhandananda's request for guidance pushed him further, and in 1894 Akhandananda began his campaign against poverty.Biography of Akhandananda on RKM Vadodara website The idea of working for the poor was conceived while he stayed in Jamnagar with Jhandu Bhatt, the famous ayurvedic physician, who served his patients with exceptional devotion.Akhandananda: Service as Worship, by Swami Devarajananda, Prabuddha Bharat, January 2009, page 135 While in Khetri, Rajasthan during 1894, he went about from door to door, all alone to bring awareness in the people about the utility of education, and it was because of his efforts that the number of students in the Khetri Rajya English School rose from 80 to 257.The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 317 Under his inspiration the Maharaja of Khetri Ajit Singh arranged for the education of the Golas and also set up a permanent Education Department to open schools in the villages. Akhandananda also arranged for the publication of a newspaper on agriculture in order to educate the farmers of that area. He also contacted renowned landlords in the numerous village of Khetri, inspiring them to take some concrete steps towards removing the miseries of their poor labourers. At the instance of the Swami the Sanskrit school in Khetri was converted to Vedic school and he raised subscriptions to purchase books for the poor students. He fed the Bhils, an aboriginal tribe, in Uadaipur. He left Rajputana in 1895 and returned to the Alambazar Math, the new monastery of the Ramakrishna disciples. He first came in contact with widespread famine during his travel in the Murshidabad district of Bengal. He sought help from his brother disciples in 1897 and Vivekananda, who had returned to India by then, sent two monks with money. On 1 May 1897 Vivekananda inaugurated the Ramakrishna Mission, and Akhandananda opened a relief centre on 15 May in the temple premises of Mrityunjay Bhattacharya of Kedar-Mahula in Murshidabad to save people from an all-devouring famine. Though rice was difficult to procure at that time, he managed to procure some with the help of other people and with much trouble. Then he distributed equally among the poor, weighing the rice himself on a scale. This was the first public service work done by the Ramakrishna Mission. Akhandananda started an orphanage in Mahula, near Berhampore, on 31 August 1897, and then established the first Rural Branch Centre of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in Mahula. In 1899, he opened an ashrama in Shivnagar near Sargachi which continued for 14 years.Genesis of RKM Sargachhi In 1899, he opened a free school there to deal with the problem of illiteracy in the locality. A carpentry and a weaving section also were added to revive those perishing village industries and make the boys self-reliant. Cotton cultivation was taught to the rural women to enhance their family income. In 1913 the present ashrama was found on a 13 acres land in March 1913. He also led in relief activities in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar and during the Munger earthquake in Bihar.The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943, page 321  Literary works  * In the Lap of the Himalayas * From holy wanderings to the service of God in man * The call of the Spirit: Conversations With Swami Akhandananda, Swami Nirmayananda Honors There is a dormitory named, in his honour, Akhandananda Dham in Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar.

For the first generation of Tiida manufactured between 2004 and 2012, the series is designated C11 and was sold as a five-door hatchback and four-door sedan. This model straddled the subcompact and compact car segments. It retailed in North America as Nissan Versa, in parts of South America as Dodge Trazo, and in Southeast Asia for the sedan only under the title Nissan Latio. The C11 bridged the subcompact and compact car classes, acting as an intermediate model between the smaller Micra/March and larger Bluebird Sylphy and Sentra models within the global Nissan portfolio. Therefore, depending on the market, the C11 replaced different models and engrossed different segments. For example, in Japan the Tiida replaced the Nissan Sunny (B15) in Nissan's lineup as the smallest sedan. In most markets it slotted between the March and Bluebird Sylphy; for North America it became a new entry-level model below the Sentra; and elsewhere Tiida tended to occupy the role performed previously by the Nissan Almera/Pulsar/Sentra/Sunny (N16), sold in Japan as the Bluebird Sylphy (G10). The G10/N16's successor, the Bluebird Sylphy G11 was not widely sold outside Japan. The C11 started to be phased out in China first, during 2011 when partially replaced by the larger, compact class C12 Tiida/Pulsar hatchback. In 2012, the C11 began to be withdrawn from more markets as its main production bases ceased manufacture. The C11 was also replaced by the subcompact Nissan Note or Versa Note (E12) hatchback, and on the sedan fronts, by the subcompact Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and the compact Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17). Nissan introduced a second generation of Tiida, the five-door hatchback C12 series in 2011 to the Chinese market. Starting in 2013, sales began in Thailand, then Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar. The C12 represents a departure from the C11, increasing its dimensions to comfortably occupy the compact class. Nissan Tiida also called \\"Patrida car\\". The development was anchored with the Nissan Pulsar/Sylphy/Sentra (B17) which is effectively the sedan version of the C12. __TOC__ Etymology The name \\"Tiida\\" is from the Okinawan language and means \\"sun\\", continuing the naming tradition started in 1966 with the Nissan Sunny.  First generation (C11; 2004)  Nissan revealed the C-Note concept car in 2003 to preview the styling of the upcoming Nissan Tiida (C11). It is a concept hatchback based on the same platform of the Renault M√©gane. It included bright beige color interior. The vehicle was unveiled in the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show. The Tiida hatchback and the Tiida Latio sedan debuted in 2004 in Japan, and in some European countries in 2007. It is based on a stretched-wheelbase variant of the Nissan B platform, and was manufactured as a five-door hatchback and a four-door sedan. The engine range included 1.5-, 1.6- and 1.8-liter gasoline engines and a 1.5-liter diesel engine. In January 2008, Nissan introduced facelifted versions of both the hatchback and the sedan. They were enhanced with some key changes including new exterior features and interior designs, retuned power steering, powertrain enhancements and a new Plus navi HDD package called CarWings in Japan. The exterior features a new grille, front bumper, headlights, taillights, rear bumper and new wheel covers. The interior sports a more modern look as well as better visibility and usability, new instrument cluster design and metallic-finish dash panels. Engines include a 1.5-liter or 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, the larger of which can be coupled to a six- speed manual transmission. There are also two optional dealer packages: the Nismo S-tune Aero Package and Nismo Performance Package. = Marketing = ;Asia Pre-facelift Nissan Latio hatchback (Malaysia) Pre-facelift Nissan Latio sedan (Malaysia) In mainland China, the Tiida is produced by the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture between Nissan and a local company. In Taiwan it is produced by Yulon. In Malaysia, the first generation Tiida was sold as the Latio and available with in both sedan and hatchback body styles. The sedan was simply known as Latio while the hatchback was known as the Latio Sport. Unveiled in May 2007 and available in June 2007, fours variants were initially offered for the sedan bodystyle: 1.6 ST (M), 1.6 ST (A), 1.6 ST-L (A), 1.8 Ti (A). The hatchback was available in a sole 1.6 ST-L (A) variant. In April 2008, a limited 'Tuned By Impul' edition was available for both variants. The 'Tuned By Impul' edition featured a bodykit, sports suspension, different exhaust system and different alloy wheels. In September 2011, the facelift version of Latio reduced the variant count to just two. A sole 1.6 variant for the sedan and a sole 1.8 variant for the hatchback. Interior In Singapore, the Tiida and Tiida Latio were initially sold alongside the older and cheaper Sunny N16 and the bigger and more expensive Sylphy. In Indonesia, the Tiida 1.8 hatchback was marketed for private use, while the 1.6 sedan was for taxi fleet only. In Hong Kong, the Tiida was used as a police car by the Hong Kong police. Some were police patrol cars whereas some were airport police cars. In Taiwan, both Tiida hatchback and Tiida sedan are produced by Yulon Motors. The Tiida sedan was still in production until May 2018. ;Europe In 2007, the first European countries began receiving imports of the Tiida. Although it has not been officially launched in the United Kingdom, some cars destined for the Irish market have been sold in the UK as gray imports. ;North America The Versa was introduced in the United States and Canada in July 2006 as a 2007 model. North and Latin American models of the Tiida use a DOHC 1.8-liter gasoline engine and are assembled at Nissan's Aguascalientes, Mexico assembly plant. It is also the only Nissan four-door passenger car in the United States and Canada to be sold worldwide, since the Sentra, Altima and Maxima are exclusive to North America. According to a Nissan press release in 2008, \\"versa\\" is short for \\"versatile space\\" meant to imply the spaciousness of the interior and configurable cargo arrangements. The North American Versa debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January of the same year. The hatchback model was introduced first, with the sedan arriving later at the end of the year, both as 2007 models. A 1.6-liter sedan replaced the 1.8-liter sedan in Canada for the 2009 model year, that year in the United States the 1.6 sedan was added to the lineup along the 1.8 sedan. The Versa is powered by a 1.8 L I4 MR series engine producing 122 hp (91 kW) and 127 ft¬∑lbf (170 N¬∑m). Three transmissions are offered: a four-speed automatic, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a six-speed manual. Two trim levels include the S and SL‚Äîthe SL offering air conditioning, power accessories and ABS, all of which are options on the S. The Versa SL also has features/options not available on the S such as cruise control (available on some S models), alloy wheels, optional CVT (the four-speed automatic is only available for the Versa S but CVT is available on some S models), optional Bluetooth connectivity for electronic devices, and a sport package which adds a power moonroof, rear spoiler, and underside aero kit. Introduced for the 2009 model year in sedan form only, is the Versa 1.6-liter which uses the HR16DE inline-four gasoline engine, rated at and of torque. The base transmission is a five-speed manual; a four-speed automatic is optional. The Versa 1.6 features black trim (instead of body-colored) for the exterior mirror housings, license plate trim, and front grille; 14-inch steel wheels; black interior; four radio speakers with pre-wiring for a radio‚Äîbut no radio itself. Safety features include six airbags, active front head restraints, and a tire pressure monitoring system. Air conditioning, AM/FM/CD audio system, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and keyless entry are offered as part of a value package. Anti-lock brakes with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist are optional ($250) on top of the value package. When it was introduced in fall 2008, the Versa's base price of US$9,990 made it the least expensive new car available in the United States, but a price cut to the Hyundai Accent usurped that distinction by $20. The Versa 1.6's $12,498 Canadian base price also undercut its competitors at launch. 2010 models featured a redesigned grille and a new design for the 1.8S model's wheel covers. In North America, the sedan was replaced by its second generation starting the 2012 model year (hence, 2011 being its last). The fate of the hatchback was however extended for one more year, 2012 being its last. Production of both for that market stopped in mid-2011. The Tiida sedan was discontinued in Mexico. It was since been replaced by the new Versa in October 2019. ;South America On 11 January 2008, Chrysler LLC and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced an agreement for Nissan to supply Chrysler with a new car based on Nissan Versa sedan for limited distribution in South America in 2009. Nissan EV-12 test car = Electric prototype = The EV-11 prototype electric car was based on Tiida and used an and electric motor, 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack rated distance, navigation system, EV remote control and monitoring. The prototype vehicle was unveiled in Nissan's Yokohama headquarters on 8 February 2009. Production version was set to begin sale in US and Japan in 2010.  Second generation (C12; 2011)  Nissan Tiida (China) Interior (Chinese manufactured) The second generation, C12 series of the Nissan Tiida was unveiled in April 2011 at the Shanghai Auto Show. Sales in China commenced in June 2011. It is available only as a five-door hatchback, and is notably not sold in Japan. The C11 Tiida sedan was instead replaced by the Nissan Latio (N17) and Nissan Sylphy (B17). The C12 Tiida is in fact heavily related to the Sylphy B17‚Äîboth base their construction on the Nissan V platform and share substantial mechanicals. The Thai manufactured versions even share the Sylphy B17's interior; the original Chinese and Taiwanese models feature a distinctive design. Powertrains also remain common between C12 and B17 models. Instead of being sized and marketed as both a subcompact or a compact car depending on the country, the new, noticeably larger Tiida will be marketed as a C-segment worldwide as the March/Micra and Latio will take the place of the B-segment markets. It is available with the 188 hp turbocharged 1.6-litre petrol engine, with gasoline direct injection paired with a continuously variable transmission. Other engines will be announced closer to the release date.Car Advice, 2012 Nissan Tiida unveiled at Shanghai 2011. = Marketing = ;Asia In Thailand, the Tiida hatchback is called the Nissan Pulsar, which went on sale by February 2013. The Tiida hatchback comes with MRA8DE, which it shares with the Nissan Sylphy. In Taiwan, the Tiida hatchback is known as the Big Tiida in advertisement due to the size upgrade and went on sale in January 2013. ;Australia In Australia, the Tiida name was dropped in favour of a return to using Nissan Pulsar, which was a very popular nameplate up to 2005. The SSS high performance version with a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine arrived in late 2013. It was aimed at the \\"warm\\" hatch market which is a category placed between standard and hot hatches. It featured a 140 kilowatt turbocharged MR16DDT engine found in the Nissan Pulsar ST-S variant. It is also found in the Nissan Juke ST-S and TI-S. The engine was connected to either a close ratio 6 speed manual gearbox or Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) automatic. Premium features included push start ignition, keyless entry, dusk sensing headlights, dual climate control and satellite navigation. ;Middle East In the Middle East, the Tiida was available with a 1.6 or 1.8-litre engine. = iTiida = Instead of updating to the C13 Tiida/Pulsar, the C12 Tiida was facelifted exclusively in the Taiwanese market conducted by Yulon Motors. The facelift was a budget update to keep the appearance of the C12 Tiida in Taiwan in line with the C13 Tiida in other markets. The facelift replaces the front and rear light units with redesigned set up and light strips, front and rear bumpers, and the front grille. The new front grille features the updated Nissan V motion styling and the rear bumper was designed to mimic those on the C13 Tiida.

Schools * Crossroads Academy * Ruth Fisher Middle School * Tonopah Valley High School * Winters Well Elementary School Incorporation efforts In 2009, a political action committee named Tonopah United for Our Future (TUFF) filed paperwork with the county, proposing the incorporation of the area into a town. The proposal ran into difficulties when the neighboring town of Buckeye voted to publicly oppose the measure. State law forbids the incorporation of a new city or town within a specified distance of existing municipalities without their approval, and the proposed boundaries for Tonopah would abut the corporate boundaries of Buckeye, essentially giving Buckeye veto power over any incorporation efforts. In 2003, Buckeye had passed a measure approving of any future incorporation effort by Tonopah, but the current town council rescinded the measure, citing concerns that the proposal would extend the new town's boundaries east of the Hassayampa River and into area Buckeye intends to annex. Council members did indicate that they were open to future incorporation efforts using the river as a boundary. Residents also expressed concern that the proposal was too ambitious and that the new town would be incapable of managing the of land included in the proposal. Geographically it would be among the largest in the state, while estimates placed the population of the proposed town at approximately 6,000. Additionally, a number of residents opposed the plan because they believed large tax increases would be necessary to fund a new government. Ultimately the measure was defeated on March 10, 2009, by a vote of 523 against incorporation versus 356 in support.

Background Wood was educated at the University of Western Ontario, receiving a law degree in 1970. He practiced law in London, Ontario after his graduation, and was the proprietor of the firm Walker and Wood. He also served on the Board of Managers for St. Paul's Cathedral in London, and was the Board Chairman for the Western Ontario Therapeutic Community Hostel.

He ran in the same riding in the 1995 provincial election, and easily defeated Winninger and Smith to become the riding's MPP. In the provincial election of 1999, he was re-elected over Liberal candidate Darrel Skidmore by only 294 votes in the redistributed riding of London West. Wood was regarded as a maverick right-winger in the Progressive Conservative caucus. He supported the Reform Party of Canada at the federal level, and holds socially conservative opinions on several issues, including abortion. During his first term in the legislature, he introduced a private-member's bill which would have mandated a 45-day waiting period for couples wishing to marry, unless they agreed to eight hours of counselling. He also criticized a government grant to Anti-Racist Action in 1999, describing the group as a leftist organization given to violence. It was probably for these reasons that Wood was never appointed to cabinet by Mike Harris or Ernie Eves. Wood also criticized his government's plan to reform the provincial system of legal billing. Wood lost his seat to Liberal Chris Bentley by over 10,000 votes in the 2003 provincial election.

During Tamaki's childhood the family moved from the farm to Te Awamutu and then on to Tokoroa in 1970. While in Tokoroa, Tamaki became interested in rugby union and a little later came to enjoy pig-hunting and participating in a rock-band playing the pub circuit. Two of Tamaki's brothers, Doug and Mike, are tourism venture operators in Rotorua. Tamaki dropped out of secondary school at fifteen, after, as he describes in his autobiography, dabbling in drugs, before completing the fourth form and took a labour job in the forestry industry. In his teens Brian begun a relationship with Hannah Lee and the unwed couple moved to Te Awamutu, where Tamaki worked on a dairy farm owned by his uncle and aunt. An incident occurred where Hannah tried to stab Tamaki to death. It is reported that he had to lock himself in the bathroom but that the blade pierced through the door, nearly wounding him. Tamaki and Lee had their first child, Jasmine, in December 1978. Later at 21, Tamaki joined the NgƒÅruawƒÅhia Apostolic Church. He lost his farm job and he and Lee returned to Tokoroa, where he attended the Tokoroa Apostolic Church. Tamaki became heavily involved with the church after pastor Manuel Renata baptised him in December 1979. Since Tamaki and his partner had not married, Renata would not allow him to carry out all the functions of the church. Tamaki and Lee then married at the Tokoroa Presbyterian Church on 22 March 1980. Fourteen months later they had their second child, a girl named Jamie. In 1982 the Tamakis attended the Apostolic Church's Te Nikau Bible College in Paraparaumu, and also had their third child, Samuel. Tamaki became an ordained elder, and then (in September 1984) a pastor in the Tokoroa Apostolic Church. Tamaki went on to establish the Rosetown Community Church in Te Awamutu, the Lake City Church in Rotorua, City Church and then Destiny Church in Auckland. On 18 June 2005 kaumatua and Destiny Pastor Manuel Renata ordained Tamaki as bishop of the Destiny Church movement (which at the time totaled 15 churches throughout New Zealand and Australia). Tamaki advocates prosperity theology, which has been criticised as immoral and potentially dangerous.Grimshaw, Mike (January 2006). \\"Religion, terror and the end of the postmodern: Rethinking the responses \\". International Journal of Baudrillard Studies 3 (1) In mid- April 2018, it was reported that Tamaki had sustained two second-degree burns to his face and body after a botched attempt to burn rubbish. Tamaki announced to members of his congregation that he was recovering and praised his wife and hospital staff for aiding his recovery.  Church and politics  Brian Tamaki at the Christchurch leg of the \\"Nation Under Siege\\" tour, 2005 In 2003 several members of the Destiny Church started the Destiny New Zealand political party, led by Richard Lewis. The party ran candidates in most electorates in the 2005 general election, but garnered less than 1 percent of the vote ‚Äì well short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter Parliament without winning an electorate seat. Destiny New Zealand was promoted by a nationwide tour and DVD labelled \\"A Nation Under Siege\\". Tamaki features in the DVD and accompanied the tour. The DVD shows Tamaki decrying what he sees as four problems with New Zealand society: \\"a Government gone evil, a radical homosexual agenda, the media: a modern day witchcraft\\" and \\"the retreat of religion in New Zealand\\". In 2004, Tamaki predicted the Destiny Church would be \\"ruling the nation\\" before its tenth anniversary in 2008. Destiny Church claimed a close relationship with New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, USA, the church of Bishop Eddie Long, until at least September 2010. In his autobiography Tamaki wrote a chapter titled \\"Spiritual Father ‚Äì a long time coming\\", in which he described meeting \\"my spiritual father\\", Eddie Long, in 2002. In October 2003, Long travelled to New Zealand after Tamaki invited him to address Destiny Church members. Tamaki wrote, \\"the ease of our connection and the confirmation of a date was entirely in line with Kingdom principle ‚Äì when God speaks, do it\\". Long travelled to New Zealand again subsequently and Tamaki usually met him each year at church conferences. On 23 May 2019 Tamaki launched a new political party, Coalition New Zealand, led by his wife Hannah Tamaki. Coalition New Zealand will not be an explicitly Christian party but will oppose abortion and homosexuality. The name of the party was deemed potentially misleading by the Electoral Commission and was subsequently renamed Vision New Zealand.  Media engagement  At the Nelson meeting of the Destiny New Zealand \\"A Nation Under Siege\\" tour, Tamaki attacked the media, the government, the Green Party and Grey Power (a lobby group for the elderly), referring to the Greens as \\"pagans\\", Grey Power as \\"self centred\\" and the media as \\"modern day witchcraft\\". In 2004 the Sunday Star-TimesSunday Star-Times (NZ)/29 August 2004 reported that Mr Tamaki \\"hijacked\\" $450,000 from elderly couple Barry and Marian Wilson. The Wilsons lent the money, which they had received from the sale of nautical clothing label Line7 in the mid-'90s, on the understanding that it was to be used to purchase a block of land in Rotorua for the construction of a church. It was reported that after almost 10 years and countless attempts to contact Mr Tamaki and his wife Hannah, the Wilsons had given up hope of ever recovering the full amount. The Sunday Star-Times asked Mr Tamaki for a response to a series of questions regarding the loan, but he declined to respond. In 2004 Sunday broadcast a documentary of Tamaki and of the Destiny Church. Dr Philip Culbertson of the University of Auckland said: \\"As far as I can tell it's a cult\\". In July 2005 Tamaki had directed \\"highly offensive abuse\\" at Newstalk ZB host Mike Yardley while off-air during an interview on 20 July. In his autobiography Tamaki denies that the abuse happened. In May 2006 a poll ranked Tamaki the least- trusted of 75 prominent New Zealanders. In June 2006 Tamaki expressed opposition to Sue Bradford's private members Child Discipline Bill, which removed the legal defence of \\"reasonable force\\" for prosecutions of parents who have assaulted their children. Home Page - Challenge Publishing Society Ltd Family Values in Jeopardy - Mass Gathering - 2 May 2007 - Parliament Grounds - Wellington In May 2007 the Reader's Digest \\"Most Trusted People\\"' poll again ranked Tamaki as New Zealand's least trusted of 75 prominent persons, followed by Ahmed Zaoui and Don Brash. He was again ranked least- trusted in 2012 in a list of 100, this time followed by Hone Harawira and Kim Dotcom.

Because we believe ‚Äì we have the same actual orthodox tenets of belief.\\" Richard Lewis, spokesperson for Destiny, earlier in the same interview deflected the criticism by re-defining the term in a pejorative sense saying \\"Well a cult is umm some exclusive community out in the backdrops of nowhere, but Destiny is the opposite of that; we‚Äôre in the middle of Mt Wellington, our doors are always open, as Bishop says; we broadcast live, we‚Äôre an open book\\". = Views on sexuality and marriage = Radio Pacific host John Banks aired an interview with Tamaki that attacked a New Zealand AIDS Foundation's takatƒÅpui (MƒÅori for LGBT-person) HIV-prevention project, in which Tamaki referred to traditional MƒÅori pre-colonial intolerance for male homosexuality, painting a picture of a society which, he claimed, exterminated gay and lesbian people. However, many MƒÅori academic authorities question the basis for this claim. The broadcasting of Tamaki's preaching against homosexuality on Television New Zealand has led to numerous complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority. Television New Zealand pulled the original opening episode of his series Higher Ground, because it \\"had language and phrases that did not meet industry standards of accuracy, fairness and balance\\". Tamaki does not recognise the sex- reassignment surgery of the transgender former MP Georgina Beyer: Tamaki referred to Beyer in his autobiography as a male. On 16 November 2016, Brian Tamaki drew controversy when he made statements during a sermon that the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes were divine retribution for sinful behaviour including murder and homosexuality. These statements preceded the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake by a few hours. Tamaki's comments were condemned by leading New Zealand public figures including the Mayor of Christchurch Bob Parker, Prime Minister John Key, and the Anglican bishop of Dunedin, Kelvin Wright. One Auckland-based critic Aaron Smithson also organized a Change.org petition calling on Prime Minister Key to revoke Destiny Church's tax-free status. On 17 November, Tamaki responded by accusing the media of bias and sensationalizing his statements. On 19 April 2018, Tamaki tweeted his support for Australian rugby union player Israel Folau's comments condemning homosexuality. In June 2019, he made an ‚Äòapology‚Äô in front of representatives from the LGBT community who were invited on to stage to share their stories and ask for a bridging of the divide between the LGBT community and the church. He told his South Auckland congregation that he is sorry for any past comments that have offended the gay community, claiming that some of his past comments were misinterpreted. But he said that he hasn't changed his beliefs, and doesn't agree with homosexual acts.https://gayexpress.co.nz/2019/06/brian- tamaki-to-gay-community-im- sorry/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/391053/destiny-church-s-brian- tamaki-says-sorry-to-gay-community-but-still-doesn-t-agree-with- homosexualityhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/national/113181008/guests-at-destiny- church-conference-signal-new-embrace-of-gay-community This apology came only one week after his wife launched a political party Vision NZ (then called Coalition New Zealand). Only one month before the apology Brian had also used the hashtag on social media #crybabygays while showing support for Australian rugby league player Israel Folau, who among other things said how hell awaited gay people. = Views on women in politics = Tamaki regards the perceived lack of male leadership in New Zealand, including the leadership over one's family, as \\"the work of the devil\\". He claims that Parliament reflects this alleged lack of male leadership. In his autobiography he defends his attitude towards women by pointing to the role of his wife Pastor Hannah Tamaki in the Destiny Church organisation, and also says \\"God is very specific about the role and function of men\\". Trans woman MP Georgina Beyer confronted Tamaki at the \\"Enough is Enough\\" protest in Wellington in August 2004, charging \\"Your hatred is totally intolerable\\". Beyer also compared Tamaki to despots like Robert Mugabe in a 3 News interview. = Views on Islam = Following the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, Brian Tamaki issued a Tweet protesting Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's decision to hold an Islamic call to prayer ahead of the two minutes of silence being held for the victims of the Christchurch shootings on 22 March 2019. Tamaki also made remarks attacking Islam as a \\"false religion\\" and claiming that Christianity was the national religion of New Zealand. = Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic = During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Bishop Tamaki courted media attention and controversy in mid-March when he announced that Destiny Church would not be closing their congregations in response to Government directives discouraging gatherings of more than 100 people. Tamiki stated that he was \\" not about to let a filthy virus scare us out of having church. To equate fear with common sense is nonsense.\\" \\"very ignorant Kiwis don't even realise their rights have been stolen\\"Tamaki's remarks were criticised by infectious diseases expert Dr Siouxsie Wiles for undermining COVID-19 containment efforts.\\" While Destiny Church held services on 22 March, they subsequently shifted to online services to comply with national lockdown restrictions. In mid-2020, Tamaki criticized the Government's alert level two restrictions limiting religious services to 10 people. Describing the Government as \\"controlling parents,\\" Tamaki announced that Destiny Church would be holding services in defiance of lockdown regulations and also called upon other New Zealand churches to join him in opposing these restrictions.

Imperial Russia = Committee of Ministers = The Ministries and the Committee of Ministers (–ö–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤) were created in the early 19th century as part of the Government reform of Alexander I. The Committee was an advisory board for the Emperor but could only consider matters referred to it by the monarch or when details for implementation of policy were brought to it by ministers. However, the Committee had little collective power and did not make decisions, just recommendations. When the monarch presided personally over Committee meetings it was referred to as a council as the monarch had decision/policy making authority that the committee did not possess.

Unlike the Committee of Ministers, this council was presided over by a Chairman (–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤) besides the Emperor, and functioned as a policy making cabinet with its Chairman acting as Prime Minister (head) of the government. As a result, from 1905-1917 the Council of Ministers collectively decided the government's policy, tactical direction, and served as a buffer between the Emperor and the national legislature. The meetings of the Council were in two parts, \\"official and secret\\". The first followed a printed agenda; the second was devoted to the discussion of confidential questions, basic issues of policy and so forth.M.

Pares, St√ºrmer was prepared to pose as a semi-liberal and would try in this way to keep the Duma quiet. The new chairman of the Council was not opposed to the convening of the Duma, as Goremykin had been, and he would launch a more liberal and conciliatory politic.

For the first time in his life, the Tsar made a visit to the Taurida Palace, suggesting he was willing to work with the legislature. According to Milyukov St√ºrmer would keep his further dealings with the Duma to a minimum. Boris St√ºrmer was also appointed on the Ministry of Interior, the most powerful of all, which had under its control governors, police, and a Special Corps of Gendarmes, the uniformed secret police. He had risen to the status of virtual dictator.Peeling, Siobhan: ShtiÔ∏†uÔ∏°rmer, Boris Vladimirovich, in: 1914-1918-online.

In the same month, Minister of War Alexei Polivanov, who in his few months of office had brought about a recovery of the efficiency of the Russian army, was removed and replaced by Dmitry Shuvayev.

When Protopopov raised the question of transferring the food supply from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of the Interior, a majority of the zemstvo leaders announced that they would not work with his ministry. His food plan was universally condemned by the Council of Ministers. Soviet Russia The Sovnarkom of the RSFSR was the basis for all Soviet governments, including both Union and republican levels, until 1946, when all of the Sovnarkoms were renamed \\"Councils of Ministers\\". With the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) fixed by law in the 1936 Soviet Constitution, the governments were little more than the executive bodies of the Central Committee of the CPSU. The CPSU's leading role was also stated in the 1977 Soviet Constitution, and was not abolished until 1991. Russian Federation After the fall of the Soviet Union the Russian Council of Ministers became the chief body of administration for the President of the Russian Federation. At times it consisted of as many as 60 ministries and state committees and up to 12 Vice-Premiers. After the 2004 reform, Government duties were split between 17 Ministries, 7 Federal Services and over 30 governmental Agencies. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of Russia and confirmed by the State Duma. The Chairman is second in line to succeed to the Presidency of Russia if the current President dies, is incapacitated or resigns.

It has been used to try to control severe allergic asthma, which does not respond to high doses of corticosteroids and less widely for chronic spontaneous urticaria. Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to free human immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood and interstitial fluid and to membrane-bound form of IgE (mIgE) on the surface of mIgE-expressing B lymphocytes. Unlike an ordinary anti-IgE antibody, it does not bind to IgE that is already bound by the high affinity IgE receptor (FcŒµRI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells.  Medical uses  =Allergic asthma= Omalizumab is used to treat people with severe, persistent allergic asthma, uncontrollable with oral or injectable corticosteroids. Those patients have already failed step I to step IV treatments and are in step V of treatment. Such a treatment scheme is consistent with the widely adopted guidelines for the management and prevention of asthma, issued by Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA), which was a medical guidelines organization launched in 1993 in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, USA, and the World Health Organization.Pocket guide for asthma management and prevention. Global Initiatives for Asthma. 2013. =Chronic spontaneous urticaria= Omalizumab is indicated for chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (>12 years old) poorly responsive to H1-antihistamine therapy. When administered subcutaneously once every four weeks, omalizumab has been shown to significantly decrease itch severity and hive count. Adverse effects The main adverse effect is anaphylaxis (a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction), with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1,000. Limited studies are available to confirm whether omalizumab increases the risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) or cerebrovascular disease (CBV). Cohort and randomised controlled studies have shown that the risk of developing CV/CBV disease is around 20-32% higher in patients taking omalizumab compared to those not taking omalizumab[46,47]. Additional multi- national, longitudinal studies with increased subject numbers are required to provide further clarification into the relationship and clinical significance between omalizumab and CV/CBV disease[46,47]. Due to the severity of CV/CBVs side effects, clinicians and health care providers should continue to remain vigilant and monitor side effects when treating patients with omalizumab. IgE may play an important role in the immune system's recognition of cancer cells. Therefore, indiscriminate blocking of IgE-receptor interaction with omalizumab may have unforeseen risks. The data pooled in 2003 from the earlier phase I to phase III clinical trials showed a numeric imbalance in malignancies arising in omalizumab recipients (0.5%) compared with control subjects (0.2%). A 2012 study found that a causal link with cancer was unlikely.  Mechanism of action  The rationale for designing the anti-IgE therapeutic antibodies and the pharmacological mechanisms of anti-IgE therapy have been summarized in review articles by the inventor of the anti-IgE therapy, Tse Wen Chang, and his colleagues. Perhaps the most dramatic effect, which was not foreseen at the time when the anti-IgE therapy was designed and which was discovered during the clinical trials, is that as the free IgE in patients is depleted by omalizumab, the FcŒµRI receptors on basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells are gradually down-regulated with somewhat different kinetics, rendering those cells much less sensitive to the stimulation by allergens. Thus, in this regard, therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies represent a new class of potent mast cell stabilizers, providing the fundamental mechanism for omalizumab's effects on various allergic and non-allergic diseases involving mast cell degranulation. Many investigators have identified or elucidated a host of pharmacological effects, which help bring down the inflammatory status in the omalizumab-treated patients. =IgE in allergic diseases= In conjunction with achieving the practical goal to investigate the applicability of the anti-IgE therapy as a potential treatment for allergic diseases, the many corporate-sponsored clinical trials of TNX-901 and omalizumab on asthma, allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, chronic idiopathic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic diseases, have helped define the role of IgE in the pathogenesis of these prevalent allergic diseases. For example, the clinical trial results of omalizumab on asthma have unambiguously settled the long debate whether IgE plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Numerous investigator-initiated case studies or small-scale pilot studies of omalizumab have been performed on various allergic diseases and several non- allergic diseases, especially inflammatory skin diseases. These diseases include atopic dermatitis, various subtypes of physical urticaria (solar, cold-induced, local heat-induced, or delayed pressure-induced), and a spectrum of relatively less prevalent allergic or non-allergic diseases or conditions, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis, bee venom sensitivity (anaphylaxis), idiopathic anaphylaxis, eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder, bullous pemphigoid, interstitial cystitis, nasal polyps, and idiopathic angiodema,. =Roles in non-allergic diseases= Several groups have reported clinical trial results that omalizumab may be effective in patients with non-allergic asthma. This seems to be contrary to the general understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of the anti-IgE therapy discussed above. Furthermore, among the diseases in which omalizumab has been studied for efficacy and safety, some are not allergic diseases, because hypersensitivity reactions toward external antigens is not involved. For example, a portion of the cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and all cases of bullous pemphigoid are clearly autoimmune diseases. For the remaining cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and those of the different subtypes of physical urticaria, the internal abnormalities leading to the disease manifestation have not been identified. Notwithstanding these developments, it is apparent that many of those diseases involve inflammatory reactions in the skin and the activation of mast cells. An increasing series of papers have shown that IgE potentiates the activities of mast cells and omalizumab can function as a mast cell-stabilizing agent, rendering these inflammatory cells to be less active. Chemistry and formulations Omalizumab is a glycosylated IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by cells of an adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The antibody molecules are secreted by the host cells in a cell culture process employing large-scale bioreactors. At the end of culturing, the IgG contained in the medium is purified by an affinity-column using Protein A as the adsorbent, followed by chromatography steps, and finally concentrated by UF/DF (paired ultra filtration/depth filtration). Omalizumab is manufactured at the Novartis' Huningue manufacturing site (France) through a partnership agreement with Genentech. Omalizumab was for several years provided only in a dry powder formulation, which requires the reconstitution with a prepacked solvent with the help of a shaker at the treating clinician‚Äôs office before injection. A prefilled syringe liquid formulation has become available in many countries.  History  The product concept of anti-IgE antibodies against autologous IgE epitopes was discovered by perinatal monoclonal IgE immunization in rodents prior to the emergence of endogenous self IgE by Swey-Shen Chen at the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and in Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) , and later confirmed by Dr. Alfred Nisonoff at Brandeis University using monoclonal IgE in incomplete Freund's adjuvant in perinates . Immunized or vaccinated rodents will develop low or undetectable levels of circulating IgE in a long-term IgE tolerance. Consequently, the passive monoclonal antibodies against human IgE can be tested for neutralizing pathological levels circulating IgE in allergic patients. Swey-Shen Chen was later an advisory consultant of Tanox, Inc. Tanox, a biopharmaceutical company based in Houston, Texas, started the anti-IgE program, created antibody drug candidates, and filed its first patent application on the anti-IgE therapeutic approach in 1987.Twombly R. Couple Lead Quest for New Allergy Drug. The Scientist January 7, 1991. http://www.the- scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11548/title/Couple-Lead-Quest-For-New- Allergy-Drug/ . In the next year, the company converted one candidate antibody to a chimeric antibody (which was later named CGP51901 and further developed into a humanized antibody, TNX-901 or talizumab). The anti-IgE therapeutic concept was not well received in the early period of the program. In order to seek funding for the anti-IgE program, the two scientist founders of Tanox, Nancy T. Chang and Tse Wen Chang, visited about 25 pharmaceutical and larger biotech companies in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, and other countries to discuss collaboration throughout 1989. Representatives of Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz to form Novartis in 1996) thought the anti-IgE program scientifically interesting and executives from Tanox and Ciba-Geigy signed a collaborative agreement in 1990 to develop the anti-IgE program.Development and Licensing Agreement, between Tanox and Ciba-Geigy 1990. In 1991, after several rounds of pre-IND (\\"investigational new drug\\") meetings with officials/scientists of the FDA, the FDA finally gave a nod for CGP51901 to be tested in human subjects. This approval of IND for an anti-IgE antibody for the first time was regarded a brave demonstration of professionalism for both the FDA officials and the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team. The scientists participating in the pre-IND discussion comprehended that an ordinary anti-IgE antibody (i.e., one without the set of binding specificity of CGP51901) would invariably activate mast cells and basophils and cause anaphylactic shocks and probably deaths among injected persons. Notwithstanding this concern, they came to the same view that based on the presented scientific data, CGP51901 should have an absolutely required clean distinction from an ordinary anti-IgE antibody in this regard. In 1991-1993, researchers from Ciba-Geigy and Tanox and a leading clinical research group (headed by Stephen Holgate) in the asthma/allergy field ran a successful Phase I human clinical trial of CGP51901 in Southampton, England and showed that the tested antibody is safe. In 1994-1995, the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team conducted a Phase II trial of CGP51901 in patients with severe allergic rhinitis in Texas and showed that CGP51901 is safe and efficacious in relieving allergic symptoms. While the Tanox/Ciba- Geigy anti-IgE program was gaining momentum, Genentech announced in 1993 that it also had an anti-IgE program for developing antibody therapeutics for asthma and other allergic diseases. Scientists in Genentech had made a mouse anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with the binding specificity similar to that of CGP51901 and subsequently humanized the antibody (the antibody was later named \\"omalizumab\\"). This caused great concerns in Tanox, because it had disclosed its anti-IgE technology and sent its anti-IgE antibody candidate, which was to become CGP51901 and TNX-901, to Genentech in 1989 for the latter to evaluate for the purpose of considering establishing a corporate partnership.Thorpe H. Drug war. (small drug firm Tanox takes on Genentech over patent rights) Texas Monthly, April 1, 1995. Having failed to receive reconciliation from Genentech, Tanox filed a lawsuit against Genentech for trade secret violation. Coincidentally, Tanox started to receive major patents for its anti-IgE invention from the European Union and from the U.S. in 1995.The family of anti-IgE patents. ; ; ; ; . After a 3-year legal entanglement, Genentech and Tanox settled their lawsuits out-of-court and Tanox, Novartis, and Genentech formed a tripartite partnership to jointly develop the anti-IgE program in 1996.Tripartite Cooperation Agreement, by and between NOVARTIS PHARMA AG, GENENTECH, INC, AND TANOX, INC. Omalizumab became the drug of choice for further development, because it had a better developed manufacturing process than TNX-901. A large number of corporate-sponsored clinical trials and physician-initiated case series studies on omalizumab have been planned and performed since 1996 and a large number of research reports, especially those of clinical trial results, have been published since around 2000, as described and referenced in other sections of this article. In 2007, Genetech bought Tanox at $20/share for approximately $900 Million. Society and culture Due to the high cost of an omalizumab, and the concern over long-term safety, treatment is not yet very common, especially in developing countries. Another barrier to wide use is its injectable dosage form. In August 2010, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom ruled that omalizumab should not be prescribed on the National Health Service (NHS) to children under 12. NICE concluded that the high costs of the compound, over ¬£250 per vial, did not represent a sufficiently high increase in quality of life. However, on March 7, 2013, NICE issued ‚Äúfinal draft guidance‚Äù about the allowance of omalizumab. It recommended the medication as an option for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children following additional analyses and submission of a patient access scheme (PAS) by Novartis, the manufacturer.NICE says yes to treatment for asthma in final draft guidance. NICE March 7, 2013. In August 2013, a researcher at Leiden University Medical Center responsible for the TIGER trial was fired for unrelated research fraud. The TIGER trial was halted as a result. In the United States it costs about $US540 to $4,600 per month as of 2020.

As the entry-level car by Alfa Romeo, it was launched at the cost of $3000 in 1971, is now $19000 after inflation. The company was based in the southern region of Italy as a part of the labour policy of the government. It is considered one of Alfa Romeo's most successful models, with 893,719 examples sold between 1972 and 1983, plus 121,434 Sprint coup√© versions between 1976 and 1989. A common nickname for the car is ‚ÄôSud. The car went through two facelifts, the first in 1977 and the second one in 1980. History =Background and development= Alfa Romeo had explored building a smaller front wheel drive car in the 1950s but it was not until 1967 that firm plans were laid down for an all-new model to fit in below the existing Alfa Romeo range. It was developed by Austrian Rudolf Hruska, who created a unique engineering package, clothed in a body styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign. The car was built at a new factory at Pomigliano d'Arco in southern Italy, hence the car's name, Alfa Sud (Alfa South). January 18, 1968, saw the registration at Naples of a new company named \\"Industria Napoletana Costruzioni Autoveicoli Alfa Romeo-Alfasud S.p.A.\\". 90% of the share capital was subscribed by Alfa Romeo and 10% by Finmeccanica, at that time the financial arm of the government controlled IRI. Construction work on the company's new state-sponsored plant at nearby Pomigliano d'Arco began in April 1968, on the site of an aircraft engine factory used by Alfa Romeo during the Second World War. =Launch= The Alfasud was shown at the Turin Motor Show three years later in 1971 and was immediately praised by journalists for its styling. The four-door saloon featured a cutting-edge technology, following the technical scheme already experimented in Lancia since 1960 on the Lancia Flavia, that is: a front wheel drive with Boxer of 1,186 cc water-cooled engine with a belt-driven overhead camshaft on each cylinder head. It also featured an elaborate suspension setup for a car in its class: (MacPherson struts at the front and a beam axle with Watt's linkage at the rear). Other unusual features for this size of car were four-wheel disc brakes (with the front ones being inboard), and rack and pinion steering. The engine design allowed the Alfasud to have a low bonnet line, making it very aerodynamic for its day, also giving it a low centre of gravity. As a result of these design features, the car had excellent performance for its engine size, and levels of road-holding and handling that would not be equalled in its class for another ten years. Despite its two-box shape, a hatchback was not initially part of the range. Some of the controls were unorthodox, the lights, turn indicators, horn, wipers and heater fan all being operated by pulling, turning or pushing the two column stalks. First series Alfasud =The range grows= In November 1973 the first Alfasud sport model joined the range, the two-door Alfasud ti‚Äî(Turismo Internazionale, or Touring International). Along with a 5-speed gearbox, it featured a more powerful version of the 1.2 litre engine, brought to by adopting a Weber twin-choke carburettor, allowing the small saloon to reach . Quad round halogen headlamps, special wheels, a front body-colour spoiler beneath the bumper and rear black one around the tail distinguished the \\"ti\\", while inside there was a three-spoke steering wheel, auxiliary gauges, leatherette/cloth seats, and carpets in place of rubber mats. 1975‚Äì78 Alfasud Giardinetta Alfasud Super 1.3 1979 Alfasud ti 1.5 In 1974, Alfa Romeo launched a more upscale model, the Alfasud SE. The SE was replaced by the Alfasud L (Lusso) model introduced at the Bruxelles Motor Show in January 1975. Recognizable by its bumper overriders and chrome strips on the door sills and on the tail, the Lusso was better appointed than the standard Alfasud (which was now called \\"normale\\"), with such features as cloth upholstery, headrests, padded dashboard with glove compartment and optional tachometer. A three-door estate model called the Alfasud Giardinetta was introduced in May 1975, with the same equipment of the Alfasud \\"L\\". The Lusso model was produced until 1976, and was then replaced by the new Alfasud 5m (5 marce, five speed) model, the first four-door Alfasud with a five-speed gearbox. Presented at the March 1976 Geneva Motor Show, it was equipped like the Lusso it replaced. In September 1976, the Alfasud Sprint coup√© was launched. Built on the same platform of the saloon, it featured lower, more angular bodywork, again by Giorgetto Giugiaro, and featured a hatchback. The Sprint was powered by a new, more powerful Boxer, stroked from the 1.2 to displace and develop , and was paired the five-speed gearbox. The same 1286 cc engine was later fitted into the 2-door saloon, creating the Alfasud ti 1.3, which was put on sale alongside the \\"ti\\" 1.2 in July 1977. =1978 revisions= In late 1977 the Alfasud Super replaced the range-topping four- door \\"5m\\". It was available with both the 1.2- and 1.3-litre engines from the \\"ti\\", though both were equipped with a single-choke carburettor. The Super introduced improvements both outside, with new bumpers including large plastic strips, and inside, with a revised dashboard, new door cards and the choice of either Alfatex (vinyl) or two-tone cloth seats. Similar upgrades were applied to the Giardinetta. In May 1978 the Sprint and \\"ti\\" got new engines, a 1.3 (1,350 cc) and an 1.5 (1,490 cc), both with a twin-choke carburettor. At the same time the Alfasud ti received cosmetic updates: bumpers from the Super, new rear spoiler on the boot lid, black wheel arch extensions and black front spoiler, and was upgraded to the revised interior of the Super. The 1.3 and 1.5 engines were soon made available alongside the 1.2 on the Giardinetta and Super, with a slightly lower output compared to the sport models, due to having a single-choke carburettor. In 1979 the Sprint was given a double twin- choke carburettor setup and became the Alfasud Sprint Veloce. =1980 facelift= Series 1 Alfa Romeo Alfasud dashboard. Series 3 Alfasud for Polizia di Stato. All Alfasuds were upgraded in 1980 with plastic bumpers, a new instrument panel, headlamps and rear lights, as well as other revisions. The Ti version was fitted with a twin-carburetor version of the 1490 cc engine that had been fitted to the Sprint the previous year, developing A three-door hatchback was added to the range in 1981 in either SC or Ti trim, and the two- door Ti and Giardinetta were deleted from most markets around that time. Belatedly, in 1982 the four-door cars were replaced by five-door versions, as by now, most of its competitors were producing a hatchback of that size, although some also produced a saloon alternative. The range was topped by the five-door Gold Cloverleaf, featuring the engine from the Ti and enhanced interior trim. In 1983 an attempt to keep pace with the hot hatchback market, the final version of the Alfasud Ti received a tuned 1490 cc engine developing 105 PS (77 kW). Named Quadrifoglio Verde (Green Cloverleaf), the model was also fitted with Michelin low-profile TRX tyres on metric rims (tyre size 190/55 VR 340 TRX) as well as an enhanced level of equipment. End of production Rusty Alfa Romeo Alfasud (about 6 years, and 88,000 km old). Despite their sophisticated engineering, Alfasuds (especially the early ones) had a bad reputation for suffering from rust, mostly due to the poor quality Russian steel used in their construction, and the storage conditions of the steel. Worse yet, bare completed bodies had to be moved outside the factory after assembly before being taken to the paint shop in a separate building, no matter what the weather happened to be. In 1983, the five-door Alfasud saloons were replaced by the 33 models. The 33 was an evolution of the Alfasud's floorpan and running gear, including minor suspension alterations, and a change from four-wheel disc brakes to front disc and rear drum brakes to reduce costs. The Alfasud Sprint was renamed the Alfa Romeo Sprint in 1983. That model was continued until 1989 by sharing 33's running gear. The three- door versions continued for a further year before being replaced by the unsuccessful Alfa Romeo Arna, a joint venture between Alfa Romeo and Nissan. =Foreign assembly= The Alfasud was also assembled in Malaysia by City Motors of Ipoh, although the plant was located in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian cars received the 1.2, 1.35, and 1.5 litre engines, and all had the four-door bodywork. In South Africa, Alfa Romeo's local subsidiary built the Alfasud in its plant in Brits. Beginning in June 1981, the Alfasud was renamed the Alfa Romeo Export GTA and received the version of the 1.5 litre flat-four. The Export GTA had the five-door bodywork.Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985, pp. 31‚Äì32 Engines * 1971‚Äì1983 1.2 L (1,186 cc) Alfa Romeo Boxer H4, 63‚Äì68 hp * 1977‚Äì1983 1.3 L (1,286 cc) Alfa Romeo Boxer H4, 68-75 hp (56 kW) * 1978‚Äì1983 1.4 L (1,350 cc) Alfa Romeo Boxer H4, * 1978‚Äì1984 1.5 L (1,490 cc) Alfa Romeo Boxer H4, 85‚Äì105 hp (63‚Äì78 kW) Motorsport From 1975, a racing series was organised exclusively for Alfasuds.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. He was the first Japanese Canadian elected to a provincial legislature. Background Tsubouchi was born in Toronto, and grew up in Scarborough in the Agincourt area. His parents were Japanese Canadians, originally from British Columbia, who were interned during World War II. After their release they moved to Toronto. He graduated from Agincourt Collegiate Institute in 1968 and attended York University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972, and a law degree from Osgoode Hall in 1975. He was the senior partner in the firm of Tsubouchi & Nichols (formerly Tsubouchi & Parker) following his graduation. Tsubouchi was also an Associate Director of the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre, and was a frequent contributor to the Law Gazette. He received an Air Canada Heart of Gold award in 1988, and was granted a coat-of-arms from the Canadian Governor-General's office in 1993. Tsubouchi has a younger brother and sister. His father was killed in a hit and run accident in 2005. Tsubouchi worked briefly as an actor. He had a minor role as a Japanese salesman in David Cronenberg's Videodrome in 1983, and episodes of John Byner's Bizarre and SCTV.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080200/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075578/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 Politics =Municipal councillor= Tsubouchi was elected as a city councillor in ward 5 in Markham and served from 1988 to 1994. =Provincial politics= In the provincial election of 1995, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the provincial riding of Markham, defeating his nearest opponent by 26,544 votes. The Tories won a majority government in the election and Tsubouchi was appointed as Minister of Community and Social Services in the government of Mike Harris on June 26, 1995. In this portfolio, Tsubouchi was responsible for presiding over drastic cuts in the province's welfare system. He also made a number of controversial actions early in his ministry, including suggesting that welfare recipients who had their funding reduced should consider haggling down the price of dented cans of tuna to 69 cents each. He also claimed that single mothers on welfare had ample time to find jobs, after having given a three-month warning for a 22% cut in benefits. Later, he prepared a sample menu which listed affordable food purchases for those whose welfare rates had been reduced. His list was found to have less nutritional value than the diet served to prisoners in Ontario jails. There were several calls for his resignation in the wake of these comments, and the right-wing Toronto Sun tabloid suggested that he should be removed. He remained with the portfolio until August 16, 1996, when he was named Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations. Notwithstanding his handling of the Social Services portfolio, Tsubouchi was regarded in some circles as one of the more progressively-minded ministers in the Harris government. He supported the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Canada rather than the right-wing Reform Party at the federal level, and in 2000 was the only member of the Progressive Conservative caucus to openly support Joe Clark for the federal party's leadership. He was also credited by some for at least making an effort to cushion the blow of his government's welfare cuts. Nonetheless, the legacy of his department's cutbacks would follow Tsubouchi for the rest of his career, and make him a frequent target of social activists opposed to the Harris government. Tsubouchi's tenure as Consumer and Commercial Relations Minister was comparatively uneventful. He was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Steven Kirsch by just over 13,000 votes. On June 17, 1999, he was appointed as the province's Solicitor- General. He held this position until a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, when he was named Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet. Tsubouchi supported Ernie Eves's successful bid to replace Mike Harris as party leader in 2002. Eves retained him as chair of the Management Board, and also named him as Ontario's Minister of Culture on April 15, 2002. In the provincial election of 2003, Tsubouchi was upset by Liberal candidate Tony Wong, losing by about 6,000 votes. In 2004, he supported John Tory's successful bid to replace Eves as party leader. =Cabinet positions= After politics He worked as associate counsel at the law firm Miller Thomson LLP, and is currently the founder and chairman of Deduce International Markets Inc In 2007 he was invested as a Knight in The Equestrian, Secular and Chapterial Order of Saint Joachim in Toronto. In recent years, Tsubouchi has worked as a partner at the law firm Fogler, Rubinoff LLP, and has been appointed to head Ontario College of Trades starting on September 9, 2013. In 2013 he published Gambatte, a memoir of his career.

History The BC Government founded the Royal BC Museum in 1886 in response to a petition from prominent citizens who were concerned about the loss of British Columbian natural products and native artifacts. Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie, Charles Semlin, William Fraser Tolmie, and former Premier George A. Walkem were amongst those who wanted to stop European and American museums from appropriating BC artifacts.Corley- Smith, Peter. White Bears and Other Curiosities: The First 100 Years of the Royal British Columbia Museum. Royal BC Museum, 1989. Notably, the petitioners argued that the export of First Nations artifacts was particularly troubling, under the premise that ‚Äútheir loss [was] frequently irreparable.‚ÄùCorley-Smith, Peter.The Ring of Time: The Story of the British Columbia Provincial Museum.

He has released eight solo studio albums and multiple collaborative albums with other artists. Stevens has received Academy Award and Grammy Award nominations. His debut album, A Sun Came, was released in 1999 on the Asthmatic Kitty label, which he co-founded with his stepfather. He received wide recognition for his 2005 album Illinois, which hit number one on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and for the single \\"Chicago\\" from that album. Stevens later contributed to the soundtrack of the coming-of-age romantic drama film Call Me by Your Name (2017). He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song and a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media for the soundtrack's lead single, \\"Mystery of Love\\". Stevens has released albums of varying styles, from the electronica of Enjoy Your Rabbit and the lo-fi folk of Seven Swans to the symphonic instrumentation of Illinois and Christmas-themed Songs for Christmas. He employs various instruments, often playing many of them himself on the same recording. Stevens' music is also known for exploring various themes, particularly religion and spirituality. Early life Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and lived there until the age of nine, when his family moved to Petoskey, in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. He was raised by his father Rasjid and his stepmother Pat, only occasionally visiting his mother, Carrie, in Oregon after she married her second husband Lowell Brams. Brams later became the head of Stevens' record label Asthmatic Kitty. His brother Marzuki Stevens is a former professional road runner. Stevens is of Lithuanian and Greek descent. Stevens attended the Detroit Waldorf School, Petoskey High School and Interlochen Arts Academy, and graduated from Harbor Light Christian School. He then attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa, and then earned an MFA from The New School in New York City. Sufjan is a Persian name, meaning \\"comes with a sword\\". It predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. The name was given to Stevens by the founder of Subud, an interfaith spiritual community to which his parents belonged when he was born. Career =Early career and the Fifty States Project (1995‚Äì2006)= Stevens performing at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan, as well as garage band Con Los Dudes. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. During his final semester at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records. He later moved to New York City, where he enrolled in a writing program at The New School for Social Research. During his time at the New School, Stevens developed a preoccupation with the short story form, which he believed would lead him to write a novel, but ultimately returned him to songwriting. While in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese zodiac that delved into electronica. Stevens followed this with the album Michigan, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals. It includes odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls and the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith, sorrow, love, and the regeneration of Michigan. Beginning with the album, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, which he termed the Fifty States Project. Following the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the album Seven Swans, which was released in March 2004. Stevens did not leave his job in the children's book division at Time Warner until touring for Seven Swans. Next, he released the second in the Fifty States project, titled Illinois. Among the subjects explored on Illinois are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville; the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the death of a friend on Casimir Pulaski Day, the poet Carl Sandburg, and the serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Stevens had spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the album. As with Michigan, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. Though slated for release on July 5, 2005, the album was briefly delayed by legal issues regarding the use of Superman in the original album cover artwork. In the double vinyl release, a balloon sticker was placed over Superman on the cover art of the first 5,000 copies. The next printings had an empty space where the Superman image was, as with the CD release. Illinois was widely acclaimed and was the highest-rated album of 2005 on the review aggregator website Metacritic. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album of the Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist of the Year. Pitchfork, No Ripcord, and Paste magazine named Illinois as the editors' choice for best album of 2005, and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to noteworthy albums selling fewer than 500,000 copies, for Illinois. In April 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Illinois recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche, which was released on July 11, 2006. On September 11, 2006, in Nashville, Tennessee, Stevens debuted a new composition, a ten-minute-plus piece titled \\"Majesty Snowbird\\". On November 21, 2006, a five CD box set Songs for Christmas was released, which contains originals and Christmas standards recorded every year since 2001 (except 2004). Stevens undertook in the project initially as an exercise to make himself 'appreciate' Christmas more. The songs were the work of an annual collaboration between Stevens and different collaborators, including minister Vito Aiuto; the songs themselves were distributed to friends and family. Although Stevens' subsequent work was sometimes speculated to tie into future \\"States\\" projects, and Stevens himself would make occasional statements alluding to the future of the project, Stevens later admitted that the project had been a \\"promotional gimmick\\" and not one he had seriously intended to complete. In November 2009, Stevens admitted to Exclaim! magazine, in regard to the fact that he recently called his fifty-state project a joke, that \\"I don't really have as much faith in my work as I used to, but I think that's healthy. I think it's allowed me to be less precious about how I work and write. And maybe it's okay for us to take it less seriously.\\" =Soundtrack album and various collaborative projects (2007‚Äì2009)= Over the 2005 winter holidays, Stevens recorded an album with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, and were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools' prank. In December 2006, the collaborative recordings were digitally released by Nettwerk as a Rosie Thomas album titled These Friends of Mine. The album was released in physical form on March 13, 2007. On May 31, 2007, Asthmatic Kitty announced that Stevens would be premiering a new project titled The BQE in early November 2007. The project, dubbed a \\"symphonic and cinematic exploration of New York City's infamous Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway\\", was manifested in a live show. The BQE featured an original film by Stevens (shot in Super 8 film and standard 16 mm), while Stevens and a backing orchestra provided the live soundtrack. The performance used 36 performers which included a small band, a wind and brass ensemble, string players, horn players, and hula hoopers. There were no lyrics to the music. The BQE was commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of their Next Wave Festival and performed on three consecutive nights from November 1‚Äì3, 2007. The performance sold out the 2,109 seat BAM Opera House without any advertising. After three weeks of rehearsing the piece with the three dozen musicians involved, he presented the 30-minute composition. The BQE was followed by an additional one hour of concert by Stevens and his orchestra. The BQE won the 2008 Brendan Gill Prize. In April 2007, in Brooklyn and Philadelphia, Stevens made unannounced appearances on Thomas's tour in support of this album. In 2007, he did a Take-Away Show acoustic video session shot by Vincent Moon standing on a roof in Cincinnati. In 2007, he played shows sporadically, including playing at the Kennedy Center to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Millennium Stage concerts. He was commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music to create a \\"music and film work\\" titled The BQE, described as \\"a symphonic and cinematic exploration of New York City's infamous Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway\\". It premiered at BAM's Next Wave festival on November 1‚Äì3, 2007. Stevens has also worked as an essayist, contributing to Asthmatic Kitty Records' \\"Sidebar\\" feature and Topic Magazine. He wrote the introduction to the 2007 edition of The Best American Nonrequired Reading, a short story about his early childhood education and learning to read titled How I Trumped Rudolf Steiner and Overcame the Tribulations of Illiteracy, One Snickers Bar at a Time. That winter, he hosted an \\"Xmas Song Exchange Contest\\" in which winner Alec Duffy won exclusive rights to the original Stevens song \\"Lonely Man of Winter.\\" The track could only be heard by attending private listening parties at Duffy's home in Brooklyn and at places around the world until 2018, when Duffy negotiated with Asthmatic Kitty Records to release the song with all proceeds going towards Duffy's organization JACK. Stevens has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul-Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena- Maneesh, Castanets, Will Stratton, Shannon Stephens, Clare & the Reasons, Little Scream, and Liz Janes. In 2007 alone, Stevens played piano on The National's album Boxer, produced and contributed many instrumental tracks to Rosie Thomas's album These Friends of Mine, multiple instruments on Ben + Vesper's album All This Could Kill You and oboe and vocals to David Garland's 2007 album Noise in You. He has contributed covers of Tim Buckley (\\"She Is\\"), Joni Mitchell (\\"Free Man in Paris\\"), Daniel Johnston (\\"Worried Shoes\\"), John Fahey (\\"Variation on 'Commemorative Transfiguration & Communion at Magruder Park\\"), The Innocence Mission (\\"The Lakes of Canada\\"), Bob Dylan (\\"Ring Them Bells\\"), Drake (\\"Hotline Bling\\"), Prince (\\"Kiss\\") and The Beatles (\\"What Goes On\\") to various tribute albums. His versions of \\"Free Man in Paris\\" and \\"What Goes On\\" are notable for only retaining the lyrics of the original, as Stevens has taken his own interpretation on the melody and arrangement. His rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" has a similar rearranged melody and arrangement as well as a whole new verse. His songs \\"The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders\\" and \\"All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands\\" were featured in the 2006 British comedy-drama Driving Lessons, starring Harry Potters Julie Walters and Rupert Grint. In 2008, he produced Welcome to The Welcome Wagon, the debut album of Brooklyn-based husband and wife duo Vito and Monique Aiuto, The Welcome Wagon. In February 2009, Stevens contributed \\"You Are the Blood\\" to the AIDS benefit album Dark Was the Night produced by the Red Hot Organization. In April 2009, Stevens uploaded a song about director Sofia Coppola online. This song was written while Stevens was in college, from a series of songs about names. Stevens recalled: > A few weeks later, our dog got hit by a snowplow and I forgot all about the > problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as > an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) in the same way > that Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs > for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor > Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else > failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a > rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I > had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to > change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, > behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one > would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my > social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, > and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, > fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And > TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk > food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old > name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, > forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, > or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, > slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? =Solo studio albums (2009‚Äì2011)= Stevens in 2011 following his return to recording and touring in 2010 after a hiatus In September 2009, Stevens began performing four new songs while on his Fall tour, \\"All Delighted People\\", \\"Impossible Soul\\", \\"Too Much\\" and \\"Age of Adz\\". That year Stevens contributed to an album with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, entitled Music For Insomnia. The album was released December 8, 2009. On October 6, 2009, Stevens' label, Asthmatic Kitty Records, released an album of versions of his 2001 album Enjoy Your Rabbit rearranged for strings and performed by the Osso String Quartet, entitled Run Rabbit Run. In 2010, Stevens was featured on The National's album High Violet, released in May, and sang backing vocals for the band on the Late Show with David Letterman. Following the release of High Violet, band frontman Matt Berninger mentioned that Stevens was recording a new album in the band's studio and that The National would appear on some of the tracks. In early August, Stevens announced North American tour dates across dozens of cities. On August 20, 2010, Stevens suddenly and unexpectedly released a new collection of tracks, the All Delighted People EP, for digital download. The EP is built around two versions of the title track, \\"All Delighted People.\\" The EP surprisingly rose to #27 on the Billboard 200 albums solely through its digital sales. On August 26, Asthmatic Kitty announced that Stevens would release his newest full-length album, The Age of Adz, on October 12. NPR streamed the album until it was released on October 12, 2010. The two albums featured a wide range of arrangements, from orchestral to electronic. Song lengths were also extended; the track \\"Djohariah\\" from All Delighted People is 17 minutes long, while \\"Impossible Soul\\" from The Age of Adz is 25 minutes long. The albums also feature many styles from disco to folk. Stevens has stated in interviews that in 2009 and 2010 he suffered from a mysterious debilitating virus infection that affected his nervous system. He experienced chronic pain and was forced to stop working on music for several months. He said: \\"The Age of Adz, is, in some ways, a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in touch with my physical self. That's why I think the record's really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it.\\" On October 12, 2010, Stevens began his North American tour in Montreal, featuring virtually all new material. The tour lasted just over a month and ended on November 15, 2010 in New York City. Stevens toured Australia and New Zealand in early 2011, featured as part of the Sydney Festival, and appeared on-stage with The National during the last of three sold-out Auckland shows. He also toured Europe and the United Kingdom in April and May 2011, playing there for the first time in five years. His shows mostly consisted of new material, but he did play many older tracks from Seven Swans and Illinois. Stevens ended the Age of Adz tour with two shows in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York. =Further collaborative projects (2012‚Äì2014)= Sufjan Stevens performing in Providence, Rhode Island as part of his \\"The Sirfjam Stephanapolous Christmas Sing-A-Long Seasonal Affective Disorder Spectacular Music Pageant Variety Show Disaster\\" tour in 2012 On February 27, 2012, it was announced Stevens would release a collaborative EP called Beak & Claw, on March 20, with artists Son Lux and Serengeti under the name S / S / S on the Anticon record label. Stevens released a 7\\" with close friend Rosie Thomas for Record Store Day 2012, entitled Hit & Run Vol. 1. He also collaborated with choreographer Justin Peck on two ballets for the New York City Ballet: Year of the Rabbit (2012) and Everywhere We Go (2014), both to great critical acclaim. Stevens, along with fellow Brooklyn musicians Nico Muhly and Bryce Dessner, began performing their classical project Planetarium, a song-cycle based around the planets in our solar system in countries such as England, The Netherlands, Australia and France from March to July 2012. On October 2, 2012, it was announced that Stevens would release a second set of Christmas albums, Silver & Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6‚Äì10, on November 13, 2012. Silver & Gold contains 58 songs, allowing for a total of 100 when combined with his first set of Christmas albums, Songs for Christmas. To support this new release, Stevens performed in 24 cities around the United States for his 2012 tour titled, \\"The Sirfjam Stephanapolous Christmas Sing-A- Long Seasonal Affective Disorder Spectacular Music Pageant Variety Show Disaster.\\" On December 11, 2012, Stevens released Chopped and Scrooged, a Christmas-themed hip-hop mixtape featuring music from Silver & Gold. As a part of Joyful Noise's 2013 Flexi Disc Series, Stevens and Cat Martino, of Stranger Cat, recorded the single \\"Take the Time\\". Martino has contributed to many of Stevens' past projects including The Age of Adz. On March 18, 2014, Stevens released the self-titled album, Sisyphus, with Son Lux and rapper Serengeti. =Carrie & Lowell (2015‚Äì2017)= On January 12, 2015, Asthmatic Kitty Records announced that Stevens would release a new album called Carrie & Lowell. Stevens shared the first single from the album, \\"No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross\\", on February 16, 2015. Carrie & Lowell was released on March 31, 2015. The album garnered critical acclaim upon its release. Stereogum placed the album on its best albums of the decade list in 16th place and described it as \\"an elegant heartbreaker of an album\\", while Consequence of Sound ranked it the 43rd best album of the decade, calling it \\"a special brew that makes even the most intimate personal moment feel parabolic.\\" The album follows the nuances and trials of life with Stevens' mother, Carrie, who was diagnosed bipolar and schizophrenic, was addicted to drugs, and abandoned him when he was a year old; it also includes Stevens' stepfather, Lowell Brams. Stevens also stated that the songwriting for the album was incited by his process of grieving and coming to terms with his and his mother's relationship following his mother's death due to stomach cancer in 2012. On January 26, 2015, Asthmatic Kitty Records announced a tour of North America, which began in April 2015, to coincide with the new album. Stevens also headlined the End of the Road Festival in the United Kingdom in September. On July 21, a second set of U.S. tour dates, which took place in October and November 2015, was announced. After Stevens performed new compositions about the Solar System alongside composers Nico Muhly and Bryce Dessner in Amsterdam in April 2012, it was reported in March 2017 that the three and James McAlister would produce an album. The \\"80-minute concept album\\", titled Planetarium, was released in July 2017. On April 28, 2017, a live album and concert film, Carrie & Lowell Live was released, featuring new interpretations, re-workings and expansions of the songs from Carrie & Lowell. In addition to the live album, Stevens announced another Carrie & Lowell companion piece, The Greatest Gift, which was released on November 24. It includes four unreleased songs from the album sessions, as well as several remixes and a demo. =Call Me by Your Name and The Ascension (2017‚Äìpresent)= In January 2017, it was announced that Stevens would contribute original songs written and recorded by himself for the coming-of-age romantic drama film Call Me by Your Name, directed by Luca Guadagnino and based on Andr√© Aciman's novel of the same name. The film was released on November 24, 2017, by Sony Pictures Classics. The soundtrack of the film features two new songs and a remix of an existing song by Stevens: \\"Visions of Gideon\\", which has been described as containing \\"lush orchestrations\\" and \\"staccato-heavy piano refrains,\\" \\"Mystery of Love\\", which was featured in the film's trailer as well as the film itself, and an \\"ethereal piano arrangement\\" of The Age of Adz track \\"Futile Devices\\". The film received critical acclaim following its release, holding an approval rating of 95% based on 311 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10, on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review of the film, Consequence of Sound writer Dominick Suzanne-Mayer praised Stevens' work as a composer on the film, noting that he \\"has a perfect ear for the film‚Äôs portrayal of a summer that‚Äôs getting shorter by the day.\\" In January 2018, \\"Mystery of Love\\" earned a nomination for the year's Academy Award for Best Original Song. Later in the year, the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media.. The song was also featured in the second season of the Netflix series Sex Education. In December 2017, Stevens released two versions of \\"Tonya Harding\\", a song about the figure skater Tonya Harding. The song's video shows a clip of the eponymous skater performing at the 1991 US Figure Skating Championships. Two days later, the single was offered for digital download and streaming, to be followed later by a cassette and vinyl release, in two versions, the one featured in the video (subtitled \\"in D major\\") and a piano- only arrangement (\\"in E‚ô≠ major\\"); in a short essay, Stevens revealed his intention to write a song about Harding since 1991. According to Stevens, \\"I've been trying to write a Tonya Harding song since I first saw her skate at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1991. She's a complicated subject for a song partly because the hard facts of her life are so strange, disputable, heroic, unprecedented, and indelibly American.\\" Stevens later revealed that the song was offered to the producers to the biographical film I, Tonya, which was released in the same period, but that they decided not to include it in the film. In October 2018, Stevens performed and recorded with pop music artist Angelo De Augustine a collaborative duo of the latter's \\"Time\\" single. On May 29, 2019, Stevens released two new songs, respectively entitled \\"Love Yourself\\" and \\"With My Whole Heart\\", which were released in celebration of Pride Month. Sam Sodomsky of Pitchfork called \\"With My Whole Heart\\" \\"five minutes of unabashed and (relatively) unadorned inspirational soft rock\\" and \\"Love Yourself\\" \\"similarly glowing\\". Pride-themed T-shirts designed by Stevens also debuted alongside the singles. He later stated that a portion of the song and shirts' proceeds would go to the Ali Forney Center in Brooklyn and the Ruth Ellis Center in Detroit, two organizations which aim to help LGBT youth. In October 2019, Stevens released an album entitled The Decalogue with pianist Timo Andres. It is based on a ballet of the same name by Justin Peck, composed by Stevens. On March 24, 2020, Stevens released a collaborative album with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, entitled Aporia. In June, Stevens announced his eighth studio album, titled The Ascension, which was released on September 25. He also released the album's lead single \\"America\\" on July 3. Artistry =Musical style= Stevens touring in 2012 performing Christmas music in the Surfjohn Stevens Christmas Sing-a-Long: Seasonal Affective Disorder Yuletide Disaster Pageant on Ice Stevens' sound has been most generally associated with genres such as indie folk, alternative rock, indie rock, indie pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, folk pop, avant-garde folk, lo-fi folk, and electronica.For coverage of indie folk see:  * *; for coverage of alternative rock see: * *; for coverage of indie rock see: * *; for coverage of indie pop see: * *; for coverage of baroque pop see: ; for coverage of chamber pop see: *; for coverage of folk pop see: *; for coverage of avant-garde folk see: *; for coverage of lo-fi folk see: *; for coverage of electronica see: * *. A multi- instrumentalist, Stevens is known for his frequent use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, woodwinds, and several other instruments on his records, layered through the use of multitrack recording. =Themes= Stevens' work is known to explore themes of love, religion, outer space, and grief. Despite many of his songs having spiritual allusions, Stevens does not identify as a contemporary Christian music artist or frequently discuss religion with the press. He told The Village Voice, \\"I don't think music media is the real forum for theological discussions. I think I've said things and sung about things that probably weren't appropriate for this kind of form. And I just feel like it's not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it's misunderstood.\\" During a 2004 interview with Adrian Pannett for Comes with a Smile magazine, when asked how important faith was to his music, he responded, \\"I don't like talking about that stuff in the public forum because, I think, certain themes and convictions are meant for personal conversation.\\" In a 2006 interview, he said, \\"It's not so much that faith influences us as it lives in us. In every circumstance (giving a speech or tying my shoes), I am living and moving and being.\\" Personal life Stevens has resided in Upstate New York since 2019, before which he had lived in New York City for 20 years. He is a Christian. Stevens also stated in 2005 that he attended an Anglo-Catholic Episcopal Church. While in school, Stevens studied the oboe and English horn, which he plays on his albums. Stevens did not learn to play the guitar until his time at Hope College.

Greetings from Michigan, the Great Lake State on the cover) is a concept album by American indie folk songwriter Sufjan Stevens, released on July 1, 2003 on Sounds Familyre, Asthmatic Kitty and Secretly Canadian in the US, and on Rough Trade in Europe. It is Stevens' third studio album and features songs referencing places, events, and persons related to the U.S. state of Michigan. The album is the first in Stevens' fifty states project, a planned series of fifty albums to encompass all fifty U.S. states. Stevens only released two state albums before admitting the project was a \\"promotional gimmick\\". The other album was Illinois, which was released in 2005. Recording and production The album was recorded and produced entirely by Stevens, using relatively cheap equipment for a market release. All of the tracks were recorded using 2 Shure SM57s and an AKG C1000, running through a Roland VS880EX, at a sampling rate of 32 kHz (lower than the rates typically used in recording). Michigan was produced in Pro Tools, which Stevens has also used for his following albums. The instrumentation was recorded in various locations: a home in Petoskey, Michigan; Buxton School in Williamstown, Massachusetts; the N. J. Rec. Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and throughout Brooklyn, including Stevens' apartment and those of his friends and St. Paul's Church. Artwork Album art features original hand-paintings by Martha Stewart Living crafts editor Laura Normandin. The two-disc vinyl edition of Michigan contains an inscription within the run-off groove of each LP side: * \\"Say YES to Michigan!\\": This was an old state tourism board slogan. * \\"Go! Tigers!\\": The Detroit Tigers are a Major League Baseball team based in Michigan. * \\"If you seek a Pleasant Peninsula, look about you\\": This is the English translation of Michigan's state motto. * \\"The Great Lake State\\": This is a popular nickname for Michigan. Critical reception Michigan received acclaim from critics. Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork described the album as \\"a beautiful, sprawling homage\\" to the state, noting its \\"lush production\\", but criticizing the excessive length of some of the album's tracks. In December 2003, American webzine Somewhere Cold voted Michigan Album of the Year on their 2003 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame list. A year later, in December 2004, Somewhere Cold voted Michigan Vinyl of the Year on their 2004 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame list. =Legacy= Upon the album's tenth anniversary, Stereogums Chris DeVille stated: \\"[Stevens's] widescreen love letter to his home state was such a momentous leap forward... Sufjan has produced a wealth of fascinating, deeply affecting (and sometimes deeply affected) music over the years... Nowadays, aggressive guitar bands like Coliseum are considered punk or metal because indie rock is the kind of genre where neoclassical whiz kid Nico Muhly contributes string arrangements to seemingly every major record, where R√©gine Chassagne passionately rocks the accordion, where Bon Iver channels Richard Marx unironically. Michigan‚Äôs flurry of glockenspiels, oboes, trombones, and, yes, banjos had a lot to do with that.\\" By 2005, it had sold 27,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Track listing Bonus tracks included on the double- disc vinyl release # * \\"Marching Band\\" ‚Äì 3:41 #\\"Pickerel Lake\\" ‚Äì 3:11 #\\"Niagara Falls\\" ‚Äì 2:22 #\\"Presidents and Magistrates\\" ‚Äì 4:16 #\\"Wolverine\\" ‚Äì 2:10 The vinyl release also includes alternate arrangements of \\"Vito's Ordination Song\\" and \\"Romulus\\". The European re-release of the album in 2004 also contains the bonus tracks \\"Marching Band\\" and \\"Pickerel Lake\\". The song \\"Redford\\" was the inspiration for the name of the protagonist of The Roots' 2011 album Undun, who used the song as the opening to a four-part instrumental movement at the end of the album.

The size of these files no longer counts against the size of the mailbox used; by moving files from a server mailbox to .pst files, users can free storage space on their mailservers. To use the .pst files from another location the user needs to be able to access the files directly over a network from their mail client. While it is possible to open and use a .pst file from over a network, this is unsupported, and Microsoft advises against it, as .pst files are prone to corruption when used in this manner. Both the .pst and .ost files use a fixed-block-based allocation scheme; the file is enlarged by a fixed amount of bytes, and the file internally maintains information about the allocated and non-allocated blocks. So, when data files like email messages are added to a .pst file, its file size is automatically adjusted by the mail client (if necessary). When mail is deleted from a .pst file, the size of the .pst file will stay the same, marking the space as unallocated so that it will hold future data items. Recently removed data items can actually be recovered from .pst and .ost files. To reduce the size of .pst files, the user needs to compact them.  Data access  Password protection can be used to protect the content of the .pst files. However, Microsoft admits that the password adds very little protection, due to the existence of commonly available tools which can remove or simply bypass the password protection. The password to access the table is stored without the first and last XOR CRC-32 integer representation of itself in the .pst file. Outlook checks to make sure that it matches the user- specified password and refuses to operate if there is no match. The data is readable by the libpst project code. Microsoft (MS) offers three values for the encryption setting: none, compressible, and high. *None the .pst data is stored as plain text. *Compressible the .pst data is encrypted with a byte- substitution cipher with a fixed substitution table. *High (sometimes called \\"better\\") encryption is similar to a WWII German Enigma cipher with three fixed rotors. Note that neither of the two encryption modes uses the user- specified password as any part of the key for the encryption.  Support  The .pst file format is supported by several Microsoft client applications, including Microsoft Exchange Client, Windows Messaging, and Microsoft Outlook; in the previous two, it was often used with a Personal Address Book (.pab) file, which stores address book. The .pst file format is an open format for which Microsoft provides free specifications and irrevocable free patent licensing through the Open Specification Promise [MS-PST]: Outlook Personal Folders File Format (.pst) Structure Specification The libpst project includes tools to convert .pst files into open formats such as mbox and LDAP Data Interchange Format. libpst is licensed under the GPL and is now included in Fedora 10. MVCOM is a commercially licensed COM Component that provides access to .pst files without MAPI. There are tools to convert .pst to other formats or to upload to other online e-mails like Gmail, for example.Migrating from Microsoft Outlook to Gmail  Formats and size  The file is structured as a B-tree with 512 byte nodes and leaves. Outlook 2002 and earlier use ANSI (extended ASCII with a codepage) encoding for their .pst and .ost files. This format has a maximum size of 2 GB (231 bytes) and does not support unicode. A file exceeding this size is likely to give error messages, such as \\".pst has reached maximum size limit,\\" and could become corrupted. Although superseded, this format continues to be supported by Microsoft Outlook 97 and later (98, 2000, 2002 (XP), 2003, 2007), by Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev1 (IMAP4) accounts and by HTTP accounts. From Outlook 2003 and onward, the standard format for .pst and .ost files is Unicode (UTF-16 little-endian). The use of 64-bit pointers instead of the 32-bit pointers of the earlier version allowed to overcome the 2 GB limit. Now, there is a user-definable maximum- file size: up to 20gb for Outlook 2003-2007, and 50gb since Outlook 2010. This format is supported by Microsoft Outlook 2003 and later. A file that is created in the personal-folders format in Outlook 2003 or in Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 is not compatible with earlier versions of Microsoft Outlook and cannot be opened by using those older versions. If this limit is reached or sometimes exceeded, retrieval of the .pst file can be difficult if not impossible. According to documentation from Microsoft, all PST files begin with the four-byte magic string \\"!BDN\\", a four-byte CRC number, and a two-byte magic string of \\"SM\\". As with any file, .pst files can become corrupted. Prior to Outlook 2003, the default .pst file format was ANSI and had a maximum size of 2 GB. If the .pst file were allowed to grow over 2 GB, the file would become unusable. Microsoft provides PST2GB, a tool that can be used to truncate a .pst file that has grown over 2 GB. Microsoft also provides scanpst.exe, that can be used to repair other .pst file-corruption issues. In Outlook 2003 and 2007, .pst files are created in the Unicode format and have a default maximum size of 20 GB. =Entourage and Outlook for Mac= Microsoft Entourage is Microsoft's email and personal information program for Mac OS X. While superficially similar to Outlook, it is an entirely different application, and uses a unique database format which cannot be imported or exported, though user data can be imported and exported to and from another unique format called .rge (a bundle consisting of many individual files plus metadata). Entourage 2008, the current version as of May 2010, has no support for .pst files, though there exists Microsoft's .pst import tool for Entourage 2004; however, the tool could only import .pst files from Outlook for Mac 2001, and not any Windows versions. Entourage is being replaced by Outlook for Office 2011 for Intel Macs, which will be able to import Outlook .pst files from Windows; however, data will be stored as many individual files, rather than in a single database such as .pst or the Entourage database. Outlook for Mac 2001, which runs under Mac OS 9 or the Mac OS X Classic Environment, connects exclusively to Exchange servers, and to this day is closer to its Windows counterpart than Entourage is. It works directly with 'Outlook 97-2002' .pst files, and can freely interchange those files with Outlook for Windows, as recent versions are still compatible with the older .pst format. The limit for Outlook 2011 is 10GB.

They are one of the four major people of Gabon, inhabiting interior mountain and grassland areas. They are around the upper N'Gouni√© and Nyanga Rivers in Gabon. Bapunu also live in the Kibangou, Divenie and Mossendjo districts of the Republic of the Congo. They speak the Yipunu or Yisira. Subgroups of the Punu (Sira) people include: Subgroups of the Punu- speaking groups include the Bagambu, Badumbi, Simbu (Dibur Simbu), Mbagyenga, Kogu, Ilabu, and Jungu. The Punu subgroups all have cultural attributes in common; most notably the tracing of matrilineal descent, inheritance of property, and succession to high political office. Punu Sira culture can also be found in the Americas, where a number of Punu knowns as kongo were taken as captives.  Origin and Ethnogenesis  According to the Oral traditions of The 9 Punu clans, the Punu came from the North via Egypt in the 5th Century BC and they settled in Nubia they were known as Ur√©w√©. Between the 100's and 500's of this era because of the growing zele of christianism and Islam they left Nubia for the Northeast of Democratic Republic of Congo and Great lakes Region ( Uganda) in where they settled and organized themselves into small chiefdoms. They brought with them metallurgy and technics of pottery. In the late 10th century some of the Ur√©w√© migrated southward occupying the South East part of actual Democratic Republic of Congo, the Eastern kasai Region up to the Tanganyika-zambeze Basin. In the 14th century Portugueses were deep into slavery trade, many African tribes who were inhabiting the inner part of East of kongo kingdom such as People of Matamba, Yeke people from Zanzibar, and the Ur√©w√© group (Suku-Bwissi-Nyangwe-kiga) Who settled in Kivu, Maniema and Sankuru were taken to America. In the 1500s the Portugueses and the christianized Kongo king were fully engaged into slavery and both parts wanted to have control on Ndongo kingdom and Matamba Kingdom resulting a resistance from both kingdoms that leads to a coalition of most of the Eastern Tribes into a powerful Army.  DNA/Haplogroup & Y-chromosome  # The Punu Peoples Haplogroup The E1b1a1a1f1a is linked to West Central Africa. It is rarely found in the most western parts of West Africa. It is however widespread in Nigeria and in certain parts of Gabon (The Bantu expansion has revisited a new analysis of the variation of the Y chromosome in West Central Africa. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1365-294X.2011.05130.x. It is also closely linked to East and South-East Africa (Eritrea, Somalia, etc.), where a group of geneticists believe it originated there. There is another school of genetic thought which states that the origins of E1b1a1a1f1a are Levantine (essentially, the eastern Mediterranean, the Arabian Peninsula and Egypt). #The Egyptians, Carthaginians, Aksumites and Omanis are Genetic cousins of the Punu group. At a mutational difference of 1, the Aksumites, Punu and Omani are the best candidates to be from the same direct ancestor. The Egyptians are too. They are only an ancient pool of direct ancestors. For the moment, we assume that all other tribes and cultures with a genetic distance greater than 1 would be genetic cousins. In other worlds. We share a common ancestry further back in time. This delay could be a few generations for some, centuries for others ... millennia. #Migration Provisions At one point in the last 1,500 years or so, a North African man with negroid male ancestors carried Y-DNA, with a key mutation, in East Africa (Uganda) and South Africa. North West (Carthage and Numidia) This corresponds to the other cultures and tribes of the same ADNJ, namely the Berbers and the Tuaregs. At one point, one of his descendants, a man of Merowic or Berber-Tuareg origin with this haplogroup and this DNA, settled in what is today Gabon. It's not surprising. Africa has truly ancient trade routes. And where there are trade routes, there are people. Where there are people, DNA is exchanged and mixtures appear. Much more DNA testing needs to be done on African populations to better understand the evolution of current African mixtures and history. Much more DNA testing needs to be done. # Punu DNA found in America The Geneticians suggested that perhaps the ancestor who had been kidnapped and then sold into slavery had been specifically chosen because it was known that his family was not indigenous to Gabon. They may have been part of Punu for only a few generations (Slavery and deportation cable). If his family was arguing with a rival family or clan, that's all it would take. The Punu were all heavily sold during the Atlantic slave trade. Given what is going on in the world right now, this scenario is not only conceivable, it is highly likely. History In 1568 a group of people known by Portuguese colonialists as Jaga warriors attacked the Kongo Kingdom people, destroying everything in their way and causing damages and loss to both King Alfonso I and Portuguese who were doing business together at that time settled for almost two years until they get hunted by a Coalition of Portugueses and Kongo Soldiers Resulting a new Migration of a group of the Jaga Northward Through the Mayombe Massif to French Congo via Cabinda by Father Bonneau and Raponda Walker. In the 17th century, they gathered rubber, Trade with people of Tyo kingdom in the North East and people of Loango Kingdom in the south West where they were Knowns as Punu. They resisted to the slave trade, getting their people sent to America by their Kongo Neighbors Fernan Vaz. In the present day. In the 1800s a fraction of jaga migrated into Southern Gabon and were calling themselves Punu or Ban Sira. In the late 19th century they were noted for their cloth made of palm fiber and iron weaponry and Bronze Masks by Paul Belloni Duchaillu. ECONOMY Punu economy is based on shifting hoe farming conducted in fields that have been carved out of the rain forests through slash and burn techniques. This is supplemented when necessary with hunting, fishing, and livestock, such as goats, sheep, and chickens. The surrounding Equatorial forests also provide various fruits, nuts, and tubers for consumption. The main crops include banana, yams, cassava, maize, peanuts, and manioc. Most labor is divided between the sexes, with men doing most of the hunting, gathering and clearing of land and women doing the other agricultural tasks. Resistance Leaders During Colonial Rules ca.1850-1930 Mavurulu Nyonda Makita Mavurulu Nyonda Makita or Mavurulu or Mavouroulou, born around 1870 and died in 1911, is a punished anti-colonial combatant leader in Gabon [1]. Mavurulu Nyonda Makita Biography Birth Around 1870 Death 1911 Biography More commonly called Nyonda Makita, Mavurulu was born around 1870 within the Bagambu clan in the Nyanga region [2]. He is a Mocab clan chief whose authority extends between the Punu and Tsogho \\"Countries\\". He would have been highly initiated in Bwiti by his uncle Mbomb√®, a Tsogho chief installed in the region of Mimongo. He rebelled with his people in 1906-1907 against the colonial policy of France. He died in Ndend√© in 1911. July 1 marks the commemoration of the Battle of Mavurulu. Nyonda Makita's insurrection (1907-1912) The Nyonda Makita uprising began in May 1907. It unfolded in southern Gabon in the Moabi region to the north and south and upper Ngounie to the east and the expansive mountain to the west. [1] Its headquarters were in Kumeramba, Murundi and Mokabe [1]. During his revolt he fought the French and especially Captain Conrad, reinforced by the Sicre battalion and by a Senegalese troop. At the same time Nbombe has been at war for 4 years, in the Fang country the Binzima Movement (1907-1910) fights with more than one hundred thousand soldiers [3]. In 1911, he continued the fight alone and hid in Lebamba. To prevent his family from being executed, he went to Ndend√©. He died there a few weeks later. His death created unrest but in 1912, the revolt was put down. Following this revolt, the Bajag territory was divided up by the colonial authorities in order to separate Mitsogho and Punu because the French feared this alliance =Ndende Dibantsa ( Jean Baptiste)= Ndende DIBANTSA (ca. 1875 - 1939) Ndende, was an anti-colonial Punu leader born around 1875 and died in a strange way, some sources claim that he had been poisoned. He was known as the most dynamic leader in the coastal regions of southern Gabon. Ndende was educated by Catholic missionaries, he could read and write. Later he had learned carpentry and worked for the French Navy in his youth. However because of the use of force, the discontent of the Indigenous Peoples, the rise of secret societies (Leopard men) and the crimes that went with it. All Gabonese leaders, regardless of their ethnic origin, rose up against Les imperialistes. Already from 1908 to the 1940s, a series of French administrators had created plans to impose segregation in the Gabonese capital of Libreville. Unlike most African ports, Libreville has never been clearly divided into African and European sections. In 1913 Ndende decided to have a house built near the residential areas of Africans and he had written a petition against segregation in Gabon and it was from there that he became the man to shoot down French colonists. Its resistance, added to the actions of other Resistant leaders like the Leopards men where Mavurulu as well as the arrival of the First World War put an end to the colonial government's projects. In 1919 Ndende and other educated Gabonese leaders decided to create the organization (LDH), the league for human and citizens' rights. I) THE INFLUENCE OF LDH In 1914 Ndende was elected President of the League for Human and Citizen Rights (LDH) and later During the same year he supported the moderation of work reforms, a leadership which spread until Dahomey where several organizations were formed. the image of the (LDH). In 1915 Ndende and the LDH had received financial aid from all Gabonese men in the Diaspora who worked in French Sudan, Dahomey, Belgian Congo, Ivory Coast and Senegal. Ndende demanded the increase in wages of all African workers and the respect of black workers on an equal footing with Westerners. From 1917 to 1927 Ndende had managed to attract the attention of the human rights organization of France whose headquarters was in Paris which turned the facts upside down. Previously complaints by the natives passed through the colonial administration before arriving in Paris but Ndende sent the complaints directly by telegram without going through the colonial administration denouncing the rise in food prices, segregation and violence against workers and natives already tired from years of epidemics. NB: Jean-Baptiste was a Catholic first name given to him by Catholic missionaries.  Society  Punu or Sira society is based on memory and traditions, they are organized around a chief, like most African societies. Ancestors and their spirits are a big part of their society as well, they believe that their ancestors can guide them and help them in life. There are Nine punu clans such as: Bumweli Mululu NGyengi Micimba Mucumba Gyejaba Gyebamba-kagye Bugyala Gyekanda Each clan has an animal as Mystical Totem that they cannot hunt or eat, which is their taboo, Many sub-clans are related to the nine main clans. There only a few general taboos that apply to the Sira in general, some are: the flesh of dogs, cats and snails. The Punu are matrilineal and patrilocal, they think their descent goes through the woman not the man Punu Sira Subgroups and Meta-Ethnic Identity The 9 Groups people's Subgroups comprise the following subgroups: ‚Ä¢Bumweli Nyongou Gyiundu N'yangi Bagambu Nganga Mubuengu Bitoudji ‚Ä¢Micimba Kungu Mujima Busoji Jungu pasi Gotu Kogu Ilabu Difund'sunga Dikuku Ibonga Lungi Kaganci Kugu Simbu Ibasa Irendi Jungu pasi Mucinga Itali Macinga Buduga ‚Ä¢Dibamba-Kadi Mululu Bundombi Ubinji Nzengi Milungi Bwingi ‚Ä¢Ndingi Ndinga Badumbi Matumu Ufur√¢ Ilombo Nyangi Dubondu ‚Ä¢Dijaba Manduma Iyengi Mubanda ‚Ä¢Bujala Babongi Musanga Muckaci ‚Ä¢Micumba nyanga Babaci Bwanga Gassinga .  Culture  282x282px Punu (Sira) culture is one of the traditional matrilineal cultures of Africa. Punu art is wide-ranging and renowned, especially for the tradition of crafting bronze and Wooden Masks and divers artifactes. Some of their most important mythological stories is called Nyambye Mbumba the creator of the universe, literally meaning \\"the Serpent God\\" Knowns as ouroburus in the most of the myths of creation in the old world. Elements of Punu culture also include, Punu art, Raphia cloth, Punu Sira seasonal Calendar, Punu Chieftaincy, Punu Masks, Punu Dances, Punu Palm wine festival, Punu tribal musical instruments and Punu religion. = White masks = One of the well known Punu art objects are the white masks with nine dots on the forehead symbolizing the nine Punu clans, now known as the Punu masks.The masks are life size, they can cover a persons face. They are worn by the dancers in south Gabon. When there is a major community event the dancers wear these masks, one major event would be a dance performed for a secret society. Europeans have been trying to discover the Punu society for a long time, but not until June 1865 did the first European discover the first white mask. Later in 1925-30 Europeans had more access to the societies and the secrecy was less than before. = Black masks = Black mask Black masks in Punu culture were worn by dancers as training masks, which perform first to announce the arrival of the white mask dancer which is more experienced. Sometimes when a misfortune happens to a group they take white masks and paint them black. This type of masks in only danced with in the dark at night. Different from the other two masks, these masks are rarely found in a museum because they used to hide them very well. They hid these masks because the belief that they are dangerous and they have an evil nature. =Tribal Dances= The Punu have several tribal Dances but the most importants are : Mukugye It characterized by a Man dancing on the tall stilts, the same dance were identified in Ancient Quilombo dance of Matamba people said MonteCocculo Mboanda it is a dance which the dancers, male or female are on stilts but in this case they dance not as a rite but for a common event like a king or chief crowning, a wedding etc. Malamu is a local Punu dance of Moabi county Ikwara is a male rite dance on short stilts. Ikoku is the most famous dance among Punu people, in Ancient time it was only used for rites but today it has been vulgarized. The ikoku is related to twins and snakes Mudume and Mubambe, during the Ikoku the dancers use mostly the waist by moving it a same way like in Oriental belly dances. Ibasa is also a local dance from Nyanga Region.  Traditional Clothes  = Ipepe = The Ipepe (Ashira clothing) is traditional weaved fabric of Punu people. The woven fiber fabric of Ashira of Gabon.The woven fabric is formed by weaving. Woven fabrics are often created on a weaving loom and composed of numerous fibers in fibers woven on a warp and weft. Technically, a woven fabric is a fabric made by intertwining two or more threads at right angles to each other. The Punu have used this technic since the dawn of time and by this technic, they made \\"Ndingi\\",a Cloth fabric made of palm fiber or Ipepe made of specific cotton and silk. = N√°mb = The Nambe- Nambi or N√°mba is a garment used as a blanket by the Punu Often made from the NDENGI factory with motifs specific to the Punu such as diamonds, squares or parallel horizontal lines in opposite colors. Today we notice a degradation of the clothing memory Chez Les Peuples punu du Gabon et du Congo whose history and culture had been erased. The N√°mba was taken by Women like Men its covered the Toub, and the tsiri. As you can see the dancer (spirit) Mukudji is the only proof of the existence of the Nambi which formerly was in vogue. = Tob = Le Tob- Tomb - Tobe (under clothing of the punu - Ashira People) The loin cloth was worn by the Apono Peoples of Gabon as underwear by men and women. The Apono Ndingi loincloth was made of silk fiber, cotton or triangular palm and tied exactly opposite in the Bushmen way - it was tied at the front and tucked in the same place. A similar loincloth was worn in ancient Egypt.  Beliefs  The Punu believe in their God Nyambye, they feared evil spirits, they used to do chirurgical operations after someone death to find out the cause of the dealth however if the cause of the late person could not be found it was then the wizard (mulosi) from the family circle who should be held responsible. People were jealous of successful people and they believe that their jealousy would cause the successful person harm or death. Illness was always seen as a work of an evil spirit and the only way to heal was by a special ritual to cast away the evil spirit's work.

James Lane Allen (December 21, 1849 ‚Äì February 18, 1925) was an American novelist and short story writer whose work, including the novel A Kentucky Cardinal, often depicted the culture and dialects of his native Kentucky. His work is characteristic of the late 19th-century local color era, when writers sought to capture the vernacular in their fiction. Allen has been described as \\"Kentucky's first important novelist\\". Early life and education James Lane Allen was born near Lexington, Kentucky, to Richard and Helen Jane (Foster) Allen on December 21, 1849. Allen, the youngest child in the family, had four sisters Lydia, May, Sally, and Annie, and two brothers, John and Henry. Allen lived at the Scarlet Gate estate in Lexington in the late 1800s until age 22 years. In 1872 Allen graduated from the University of Kentucky, Lexington, taught at Fort Spring, Kentucky, at Richmond and at Lexington, Missouri, and from 1877 to 1879 at the academy of the University of Kentucky, where he was principal and taught modern languages. In 1880 he was professor of Latin and English at Bethany College (West Virginia); and then became head of a private school at Lexington, Kentucky. Allen spent his youth in Lexington during the Antebellum era, the American Civil War, and the Reconstruction periods. His childhood experience heavily influenced his writing. He described living at Scarlet Gate in the introduction to A Kentucky Cardinal.  Career in New York  In 1893 Allen moved to New York City, where he lived until his death. He was a contributor to Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, and other popular magazines of the time. His novels include The Choir Invisible, which was a very popular best seller in 1897.(6 October 1946). Fifty Years of Best Sellers, compiled in Popular Culture(19 February 1925).

Various identifications have been made in modern times, the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the most celebrated.  Ancient testimony  People of the ancient world were long curious about the source of the Nile, especially Ancient Greek geographers. A number of expeditions up the Nile failed to find the source. Eventually, a merchant named Diogenes reported that he had traveled inland from Rhapta in East Africa for twenty-five days and had found the source of the Nile. He reported it flowed from a group of massive mountains into a series of large lakes. He reported the natives called this range the Mountains of the Moon because of their snowcapped whiteness. These reports were accepted as true by most Greek and Roman geographers, most notably by PtolemyHis Geographia, IV.8. reports ‚ÄúThe Mountain of the Moon‚Äù (œÑ·Ω∏ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ£ŒµŒªŒÆŒΩŒ∑œÇ ·ΩÑœÅŒøœÇ) and its location. But William D. Cooley in an 1854 monograph argued that the passage in question is a later interpolation., who produced maps that indicated the reported location of the mountains. Late Arab geographers, despite having far more knowledge of Africa, also took the report at face value, and included the mountains in the same location given by Ptolemy.Ralph Ehrenberg, Mapping the World : An Illustrated History of Cartography (National Geographic, 2005)  Modern identifications  A map of Africa, published by John Cary in 1805, showing the Mountains of the Moon Anthony Finley's map of 1827 owes much to that of Cary, once again depicting the Mountains of the Moon as the source of the White Nile. It was not until modern times that Europeans resumed their search for the source of the Nile. The Scottish explorer, James Bruce, who travelled to Gojjam, Ethiopia, in 1770, investigated the source of the Blue Nile there. He identified the \\"Mountains of the Moon\\" with Mount Amedamit, which he described surrounded the source of the Lesser Abay \\"in two semi-circles like a new moon ... and seem, by their shape, to deserve the name of mountains of the moon, such as was given by antiquity to mountains in the neighborhood of which the Nile was supposed to rise.\\"James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 5 p. 209 James Grant and John Speke in 1862 sought the source of the White Nile in the Great Lakes region. Henry Morton Stanley finally found glacier-capped mountains possibly fitting Diogenes's description in 1889 (they had eluded European explorers for so long due to often being shrouded in mist). Today known as the Rwenzori Mountains, the peaks are the source of some of the Nile's waters, but only a small fraction, and Diogenes would have crossed the Victoria Nile to reach them. Many modern scholars doubt that these were the Mountains of the Moon described by Diogenes, some holding that his reports were wholly fabricated. G.W.B. Huntingford suggested in 1940 that the Mountain of the Moon should be identified with Mount Kilimanjaro, and \\"was subsequently ridiculed in J. Oliver Thompson's History of Ancient Geography published in 1948\\".

He is the brother of well-known psychedelics proponent Terence McKenna and is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit organization concerned with the investigation of the potential therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines.  Education  McKenna received his Master's degree in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979. He received his doctorate in botanical sciences in 1984 from the University of British Columbia, where he wrote a dissertation entitled Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in Amazonian hallucinogenic plants: ethnobotanical, phytochemical, and pharmacological investigations. McKenna then received post-doctoral research fellowships in the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, National Institute of Mental Health, and in the Department of Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine.  Career  McKenna's research led to the development of natural products for Aveda Corporation as well as greater awareness of natural products and medicines. He has authored numerous scientific articles and books. He co-authored The Invisible Landscape with his brother Terence and Botanical Medicines: the Desk Reference for Major Herbal Supplements with Kenneth Jones and Kerry Hughes. McKenna spent a number of years as a senior lecturer for the Center for Spirituality and Healing, part of the Academic Health Center at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He is now a senior research scientist for the Natural Health Products Research Group at the British Columbia Institute of Technology in the Vancouver area. His research has included the pharmacology, botany, and chemistry of ayahuasca and oo-koo-h√©, the subjects of his master's thesis. He has also conducted extensive fieldwork in the Peruvian, Colombian, and Brazilian Amazon. Psilocybin mushroom cultivation During the early 1970s McKenna developed a technique for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms with his brother Terence and they published what they had learned in a book entitled Psilocybin - Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide. McKenna and his brother were the first to come up with a reliable method for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms at home.

Definition The exact meaning, which appears in scattered contemporary sources, is a matter of debate among musicologists. While some of the sources are contradictory, four aspects seem clear: # musica reservata involved use of chromatic progressions and voice-leading, a manner of composing which became fashionable in the 1550s, both in madrigals and motets; # it involved a style of performance, perhaps with extra ornamentation or other emotive methods; # it used word- painting, i.e. use of specific and recognizable musical figures to illuminate specific words in the text; and # the music was designed to be performed by, and appreciated by, small groups of connoisseurs. Composers in the style of musica reservata included Nicola Vicentino (spelled as Musica riserbata), who wrote about it in his L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica (1555);\\"...perche con effetto comprendono che (come li scrittori antichi dimostrano) era meritamente ad altro uso la Cromatica & Enarmonica Musica riserbata che la Diatonica, perche questa in feste publiche in luoghi communi a uso delle uulgari orecchie si cantaua: quelle fra li priuati sollazzi de Signori e Principi, ad uso delle purgate orecchie in lode di gran personaggi et Heroi s'adoperauano\\". Citation by Thesaurum Musicarum Italicarum. Philippe de Monte, the prolific composer of madrigals who mainly worked in Vienna; and above all, Orlande de Lassus, the renowned and versatile composer working in Munich whose Prophetiae Sibyllarum, probably written in the 1560s, may represent the peak of development of the style. The chord progression which begins the Prophetiae Sibyllarum is jarring even to ears accustomed to 20th- century music: the opening chords are C major ‚Äì G major ‚Äì B major ‚Äì C minor ‚Äì E major ‚Äì F minor, all in root position, sung to the text: \\"Carmina chromatico, quae audis modulata tenore\\" ‚Äì literally \\"songs, which you hear rendered by a chromatic tenor\\" (maybe with reference to all-chromatic composition which 'technically' based on a chromatic tenor). The style of musica reservata, with its implication of a highly refined, perhaps manneristic style of composition and performance along with a very small audience, is reminiscent both of the ars subtilior of the Avignon group of composers of the late 14th century, and also perhaps some of the contemporary avant-garde classical music of the late 20th century. The style can also be compared to the Italian composer Carlo Gesualdo's chromatic madrigals and motets a few decades later.

There by the Sira river was the place where they got that name from. From the 6th to the 18th century they migrated from Nubia via Uganda and DRC into their actual area, after wars with other groups.

In Gestalt psychology it is known as identifying a figure from the background. For example, black words on a printed paper are seen as the \\"figure,\\" and the white sheet as the \\"background\\".Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. \\"Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception, Vision II: Recognizing What We Perceive.\\" Psychology. ; Second Edition. N.p.: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 149-50. Print.  Gestalt Psychology  The Gestalt theory was founded in the 20th century in Austria and Germany as a reaction against the associationist and structural schools‚Äô atomistic orientation. In 1912, the Gestalt school was formed by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang K√∂hler, and Kurt Koffka. The word \\"gestalt\\" is a German word translated to English as \\"pattern\\" or \\"configuration.\\" Gestalt concepts can also be referred to as \\"holism.\\" Gestalt Psychologists were attempting to humanize what was considered a sterile approach. Gestalt psychology establishes that the whole of anything is greater than its parts. The concepts explored by Wertheimer, K√∂hler, and Koffka in the 20th century established the foundation for the modern study of perception. \\"The Gestalt concept is that \\"not only movement, or process as such, but also the direction and distribution of process is determined dynamically by interaction.\\" Sensory organization is not dependent upon isolated stimuli and local stimulation, but upon the relative properties of stimulation and the dynamical context.\\" Wertheimer described holism as the ‚Äúfundamental formula‚Äù of Gestalt psychology: ‚ÄúThere are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole.\\" Examples The faces‚Äìvase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin describedRubin, E. (1921) Visuell Wahrgenommene Figuren : Studien in psychologischer Analyse. Kobenhaven: Gyldendalske boghandel.Rubin, E. (2001). Figure and Ground. In Yantis, S.(Ed.), Visual Perception. (pp. 225-229). Philadelphia, Psychology Press exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure‚Äìground organization, edge- assignment and its effect on shape perception. In the faces‚Äìvase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward, then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outward, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background, and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them, a phenomenon known as multistable perception. Functional brain imaging shows that, when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region.Schacter, L.D., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M. (2011). \\"Psychology (2nd ed.).\\" New York, NY: Worth PublishersHasson, U., Hendler, T., Ben Bashat, D., and Malach, R. (2001). Vase or face? A neural correlate of shape-selective grouping processes in the human brain. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 13, 744‚Äì753. An additional example is the \\"My Wife and My Mother-in-Law\\" illusion drawing. The image is famous for being reversible. \\"The viewer may either observe a young girl with her head turned to the right or an old woman with a large nose and protruding chin, depending on one's perspective.\\"  Development  Figure‚Äìground perception precedes all other visual perceptual skills and is one of the first to develop in a young baby. The development of perceptual organization develops as early as infancy in human beings. In regards to nature versus nurture, concepts such as \\"lightness\\" and \\"proximity\\" may develop as early as birth, but recognizing \\"form similarity\\" may not be functional until activated by particular experiences. Three- to four-month olds respond to differences in lightness rather than differences in form similarity. It is suggested that scaffolding (the development of new skills over time based on the building of other skills) is responsible for the development of perceptual organization. Environment plays a major role in the development of figure-ground perception. The development of figure‚Äìground perception begins the day the baby can focus on an object. The faces of caregivers, parents, and familiar objects are the first to be focused on and understood. As babies develop, they learn to distinguish the objects they desire from their surroundings. Sitting up, crawling, and walking present ample opportunity to develop the skill during development. Between the ages of 2‚Äì4 the skill can be further cultivated by teaching the child to group or sort items. Perceptual process How does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background. The LOC (lateral occipital cortex) is highly important for figure-ground perception. This region of the visual cortex (located lateral to the fusiform gyrus and extending anteriorly and ventrally) has consistently shown stronger activation in response to objects versus non-objects.\\" Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure‚Äìground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, Bayesian figure‚Äìground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground. Subjective factors can also influence figure‚Äìground perception. For instance, if a viewer has the intention to perceive one of the two regions as the figure, it will likely alter their ability to analyze the two regions objectively. In addition, if a viewer's gaze is fixated on a particular region, the viewer is more likely to view the fixated region as the figure. Although subjective factors can alter the probability of seeing the figure on one particular side of an edge, they tend not to overpower compositional cues.  Artistic applications  Figure‚Äìground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure‚Äìground reversal may be used as an intentional visual design technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images. Non-visual Figure‚Äìground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include non-visual concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space. The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself. In the typical sonic scenarios people encounter, auditory figure and ground signals often overlap in time as well as in frequency content. In these situations, auditory objects are established by integrating sound components both over time and frequency. A 2011 study suggests that the auditory system possesses mechanisms that are sensitive to such cross-frequency and cross-time correlations. Results of this study demonstrated significant activations in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the superior temporal sulcus related to bottom-up, stimulus-driven figure‚Äìground decomposition. In crowded rooms or parties, a person is able to zero in on the conversation they are having with one person (figure) while drowning out the background noise (ground). This can also be referred to as the \\"cocktail party effect.\\" Figure-ground segregation in hearing is not automatic; rather, it requires attention and draws on resources that are shared across vision and audition. Types of figure‚Äìground problems Type 2: The actual ground is the figure. There are three types of figure‚Äìground problems: #The figure and the ground compete. #The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure. #The figure and ground create an optical illusion.Lohr L.

He served as president of the American Philological Association in 1992. Biography Born in Vienna, he received BAs from Columbia University and Oxford University, and the PhD from Harvard University, in 1964. He also received the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. His earlier work focussed on the later Roman Republic, and culminated in The Last Generation of the Roman Republic, a work often cited as a response to Ronald Syme's The Roman Revolution. Gruen's argument is that the Republic was not in decay, and so not necessarily in need of \\"rescue\\" by Caesar Augustus and the institutions of the Empire. He later worked on the Hellenistic period and on Judaism in the classical world. Gruen taught what was purportedly his final undergraduate lecture course, The Hellenistic World, in the Fall of 2006. Despite his retirement from full-time teaching, he continues to oversee doctoral dissertations and is widely sought for visiting professorships. In addition to U.C.

They released three albums on Island Records, but were best known for their live shows and launching the solo careers of Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer. History Vinegar Joe evolved out of Dada, a 12-piece Stax-influenced, jazz/blues rock fusion band. Dada released one eponymous album in 1970, with a line up including vocalist Elkie Brooks and guitarist Pete Gage. Singer Robert Palmer, formerly with The Alan Bown Set joined Dada after the album had been recorded. Dada were signed by Ahmet Ertegun for Atlantic Records. After their US tour, Ahmet sub-licensed them to Chris Blackwell of Island Records for the UK and rest of the world, with instructions to reduce the line up to form Vinegar Joe in 1971, adding keyboard player Dave Thompson, but the band was still without a drummer. Phil Collins had unsuccessfully applied for the job. Conrad Isidore[ Conrad Isadore (Isidore)] at AllMusic and Rob Tait drummed on the first album. Tim Hinkley added keyboards alongside Dave Thompson and it was Hinkley who appeared on the cover of the first album. Their debut LP Vinegar Joe was released in April 1972 on Island Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US. The album cover featured plasticine models of the band created by John Padley. Tim Hinkley took over from Thompson on keyboards and was succeeded by John Hawken. Drummer Rob Tait played the first series of live shows succeeded by John Woods. Mike Deacon took over on keyboards. During recording of their second album, Rock'n Roll Gypsies, also released in 1972, Keef Hartley played drums. Guitarist Jim Mullen also joined the band for this record and played on the US tour. The artwork for the album was supplied by Hipgnosis. Drummer Pete Gavin joined the band prior to the US tour and recording of their third and final album Six Star General released in 1973. The band dissolved in the spring of 1974. Alan Powell played drums during the band's final weeks. Subsequently, Brooks and Palmer went on to enjoy success as solo musicians. Gage became a record producer and arranger, working with Brooks, his wife, until their divorce, and a range of musicians such as Joan Armatrading and specialising in upcoming rockabilly and punk bands including as Restless and King Kurt.

This view in Christian eschatology does not hold that Jesus Christ will physically reign on the earth for exactly 1,000 years. This view contrasts with some postmillennial interpretations and with premillennial interpretations of chapter 20 of the Book of Revelation. The amillennial view regards the \\"thousand years\\" mentioned in Revelation 20 as a symbolic number, not as a literal description; amillennialists hold that the millennium has already begun and is identical with the current church age. Amillennialism holds that while Christ's reign during the millennium is spiritual in nature, at the end of the church age, Christ will return in final judgment and establish a permanent reign in the new heaven and new earth. Many proponents dislike the term \\"amillennialism\\" because it emphasizes their differences with premillennialism rather than their beliefs about the millennium. \\"Amillennial\\" was actually coined in a pejorative way by those who hold premillennial views. Some proponents also prefer alternate names such as nunc-millennialism (that is, now-millennialism) or realized millennialism, although these other names have achieved only limited acceptance and usage. Anthony Hoekema, \\"Amillennialism\\" Variations In Amillenarism there are two main variations: perfect Amillenarism (the first resurrection has already happened) and imperfect Amillenarism (the first resurrection will happen simultaneously with the second one). The common denominator for all amillenaristic views is the denial of the Kingdom of the righteous on earth before the general resurrection.Valeriy Sterkh, Apocalypse. Millennium: Chiliasm and Chillegorism (Ekaterinburg: Ridero, 2020), Section 7. =The perfect Amillenarism= * Marcion (c. 85 ‚Äì 160) taught that only souls will resurrect, rejecting the bodily resurrection. He followed the teachings of Simon Magus (1st century) and Cerdo (1st-2nd centuries) [See. St. Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies, 1, 27; St. Epiphanius of Cyprus, Panarion. Against the Marcionites, Heresies 22 and 42]. * Origen (c. 185 ‚Äì 254) further developed the Amillenarism of Marcion in his teaching about the reign of the saints in heaven while rejecting the idea of the Kingdom of the righteous coming down to the earth [On the First Principles, book 2, chapter 11; Against Celsus, book 2, chapter 5]. This teaching was later supported by Gaius of Rome (died c. 217) [See Eusebius], St. Dionysius of Alexandria (died 265) [See Eusebius], and Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 263 ‚Äì 340) [Church History, volume 3, chapter 28; volume 7, chapters 24-25]. * Emanuel Swedenborg (1688 ‚Äì 1772) taught about the reign of saints in heaven but denied the bodily resurrection [The Open Apocalypse, chapter 20]. * In A.P. Lopukhin's Explanatory Bible (1904 ‚Äì 1913), the first resurrection refers to the state of the righteous souls reigning in heaven, that is, \\"they can be guides and helpers to the Christians who are still fighting the good fight of faith on the earth. The souls find in this a new source of joy and blessing\\" [Rev 20:4-5]. * Sickenberger (20th century) interprets the first resurrection as the ascension of the souls of martyrs into heaven. The Millennium is for him \\"a symbolic number\\". * Giblin (20th century), Tadros Malaty (20th century) see the Millennium as the life of saints in heaven. * Daniil Sysoev, a priest (1974 ‚Äì 2009), taught that the first resurrection is the life and reign of the righteous souls in heaven [Conversations on the Apocalypse, chapter 20]. =The imperfect Amillenarism= * Cerinthus (1st-2nd centuries) believed that Jesus Christ \\"has not yet risen but will rise when the general resurrection of the dead takes place\\" [See St. Epiphanius of Cyprus, Panarion, Against Cerinthians, or Merinthians, Heresies 8 and 28, ¬ß6], i.e. he denied the first resurrection. At the same time, he also said something quite different: \\"Jesus suffered and rose from the dead, but Christ, who had descended upon Him, went up to heaven without suffering. And the one who came down from heaven in the form of a dove is Christ, but Jesus is not Christ\\" [ibid., ¬ß1; St. Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies, book 1, chapter 26]. * St. Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306 ‚Äì 373) believed that the first resurrection would occur simultaneously with the second and both would constitute \\"one resurrection\\". The Millennium signifies \\"the immensity of eternal life\\" [Discourse 96. On repentance]. * Blessed Theodoret of Cyrus (386 ‚Äì 457) expressed similar views on the Millennium to those of St. Ephrem‚Äôs. [A Brief Exposition of Divine Dogmas, chapter 21]. * Kraft (20th century) describes the first resurrection as the resurrection of the martyrs and sees the second one as the judgment over all the dead, which basically means that he denies the Millennium. Teaching Amillennialism rejects the idea of a future millennium in which Christ will reign on earth prior to the eternal state beginning, but holds: * that Jesus is presently reigning from heaven, seated at the right hand of God the Father, * that Jesus also is and will remain with the church until the end of the world, as he promised at the Ascension, * that at Pentecost (or days earlier, at the Ascension), the millennium began, citing Acts 2:16-21, where Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32 on the coming of the kingdom, to explain what is happening, * and that, therefore the Church and its spread of the good news is indeed Christ's Kingdom and forever will be. Amillennialists also cite scripture references to the kingdom not being a physical realm: * , where Jesus cites his driving out of demons as evidence that the kingdom of God had come upon them * , where Jesus warns that the coming of the kingdom of God can not be observed, and that it is among them * , where Paul speaks of the kingdom of God being in terms of the Christians' actions Amillennialists regard the thousand-year period as a figurative duration for Christ's reign, as in , where the \\"thousand hills\\" on which God owns the cattle are all hills, or in , where the \\"thousand generations\\" to whom God will be faithful are all generations. Some postmillennialists and most premillennialists assert that it should be taken as a literal thousand-year period. Amillennialism also teaches that the binding of Satan, described in Revelation, has already occurred; he has been prevented from \\"deceiving the nations\\" by the spread of the gospel. Nonetheless, good and evil will remain mixed in strength throughout history and even in the church, according to the amillennial understanding of the Parable of the Wheat and Tares. Amillennialism is sometimes associated with Idealism, as both schools teach a symbolic interpretation of many of the prophecies of the Bible and especially of the Book of Revelation. However, many amillennialists do believe in the literal fulfillment of Biblical prophecies; they simply disagree with Millennialists about how or when these prophecies will be fulfilled. History Comparison of Christian millennial interpretations. Some Amilleniallists, such as Roman Catholics, believe in a scenario close to Post-tribulational Premillennialism, but with the Antichrist taking the place of the second coming in the timeline, the millennium after Antichrist being symbolic, and the second coming occurring at the same time as the last judgment. =Early church= Few early Christians wrote about this aspect of eschatology during the first century of Christianity, but most of the available writings from the period reflect a millenarianist perspective (sometimes referred to as chiliasm). Bishop Papias of Hierapolis (A.D. 70‚Äì155) speaks in favor of a pre-millennial position in volume three of his five volume work and Aristion and the elder John echoed his sentiments, as did other first-hand disciples and secondary followers. Though most writings of the time tend to favor a millennial perspective, the amillennial position may have also been present in this early period, as suggested in the Epistle of Barnabas, and it would become the ascendant view during the next two centuries. Church fathers of the third century who rejected the millennium included Clement of Alexandria ( 150 ‚Äì 215), Origen (184/185 ‚Äì 253/254), and Cyprian ( 200 ‚Äì 258). Justin Martyr (died 165), who had chiliastic tendencies in his theology,\\"Always Victorious!\\" by Francis Nigel Lee mentions differing views in his Dialogue with Trypho the Jew, chapter 80: > \\"I and many others are of this opinion [premillennialism], and [believe] > that such will take place, as you assuredly are aware; but, on the other > hand, I signified to you that many who belong to the pure and pious faith, > and are true Christians, think otherwise.\\"Catholic Answers on \\"The Rapture\\" Certain amillennialists such as Albertus Pieters understand Pseudo-Barnabas to be amillennial. In the 2nd century, the Alogi (those who rejected all of John's writings) were amillennial, as was Caius in the first quarter of the 3rd century.Eusebius, 3.28.1‚Äì2 With the influence of Neo-Platonism and dualism, Clement of Alexandria and Origen denied premillennialism.De Principiis, 2.11.2-3 Likewise, Dionysius of Alexandria (died 264) argued that Revelation was not written by John and could not be interpreted literally; he was amillennial.Eusebius, Church History, 7.24.3; 7.25 Origen's idealizing tendency to consider only the spiritual as real (which was fundamental to his entire system) led him to combat the \\"rude\\"The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Vol.8, p. 273 or \\"crude\\"The Anchor Bible Dictionary (1997) article \\"Chiliasm\\", The Labyrinth of the World and the Paradise of the Heart (Johann Amos Comenius, ed. 1998) p. 42 and Jews and Christians: The Parting of the Ways, A.D. 70 to 135 (James D. G. Dunn, 1999) p. 52. Chiliasm of a physical and sensual beyond. Premillennialism appeared in the available writings of the early church, but it was evident that both views existed side by side. The premillennial beliefs of the early church fathers, however, are quite different from the dominant form of modern-day premillennialism, namely dispensational premillennialism. Boyd, pp. 90f: \\"It is the conclusion of this thesis that Dr. Ryrie's statement [that dispensationalism was the view of the early church fathers] is historically invalid within the chronological framework of this thesis. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: (1) the writers/writings surveyed did not generally adopt a consistently applied literal interpretation; (2) they did not generally distinguish between the Church and Israel; (3) there is no evidence that they generally held to a dispensational view of revealed history; (4) although Papias and Justin Martyr did believe in a Millennial kingdom, the 1,000 years is the only basic similarity with the modern system (in fact, they and dispensational pre- millennialism radically differ on the basis of the Millennium); (5)they had no concept of imminency or a pre-tribulational rapture of the Church; (6) in general, their eschatological chronology is not synonymous with that of the modern system. Indeed, this thesis would conclude that the eschatological beliefs of the period studied would be generally inimical to those of the modern system (perhaps, seminal amillennialism, and not nascent dispensational pre-millennialism ought to be seen in the eschatology of the period).\\" =Medieval and Reformation periods= Amillennialism gained ground after Christianity became a legal religion. It was systematized by St. Augustine in the 4th century, and this systematization carried amillennialism over as the dominant eschatology of the Medieval and Reformation periods. Augustine was originally a premillennialist, but he retracted that view, claiming the doctrine was carnal.\\"City of God, Book 20, Chapter 7\\" Amillennialism was the dominant view of the Protestant Reformers. The Lutheran Church formally rejected chiliasm in The Augsburg Confession‚Äî\\"Art. XVII., condemns the Anabaptists (of Munster‚Äîhistorically most Anabaptist groups were amillennial) and others ‚Äôwho now scatter Jewish opinions that, before the resurrection of the dead, the godly shall occupy the kingdom of the world, the wicked being everywhere suppressed.'\\"Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Vol. 2 (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, n.d.) 381. Likewise, the Swiss Reformer Heinrich Bullinger wrote up the Second Helvetic Confession, which reads \\"We also reject the Jewish dream of a millennium, or golden age on earth, before the last judgment.\\"Philip Schaff History of Creeds Vol. 1, 307. John Calvin wrote in Institutes that chiliasm is a \\"fiction\\" that is \\"too childish either to need or to be worth a refutation.\\" He interpreted the thousand-year period of Revelation 20 non-literally, applying it to the \\"various disturbances that awaited the church, while still toiling on earth.\\"John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, XXV.V =Modern times= Amillennialism has been widely held in the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches as well as in the Roman Catholic Church, which generally embraces an Augustinian eschatology and which has deemed that premillennialism \\"cannot safely be taught.\\" Amillennialism is also common among Protestant denominations such as the Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Methodist and many Messianic Jews. It represents the historical position of the Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites (though among the more modern groups premillennialism has made inroads). It is common among groups arising from the 19th century American Restoration Movement such as the Churches of Christ,Ron Rhodes, The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations, Harvest House Publishers, 2005, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Christian churches and churches of Christ. It also has a following amongst Baptist denominations such as The Association of Grace Baptist Churches in England. Partial preterism is sometimes a component of amillennial hermeneutics. Amillennialism declined in Protestant circles with the rise of Postmillennialism and the resurgence of Premillennialism in the 18th and 19th centuries, but it has regained prominence in the West after World War II.

By transverse circle, is meant a closed loop that is always transverse to the tangent field of the foliation. Equivalently, by a result of Dennis Sullivan, a codimension 1 foliation is taut if there exists a Riemannian metric that makes each leaf a minimal surface. Taut foliations were brought to prominence by the work of William Thurston and David Gabai. Related concepts Taut foliations are closely related to the concept of Reebless foliation. A taut foliation cannot have a Reeb component, since the component would act like a \\"dead-end\\" from which a transverse curve could never escape; consequently, the boundary torus of the Reeb component has no transverse circle puncturing it. A Reebless foliation can fail to be taut but the only leaves of the foliation with no puncturing transverse circle must be compact, and in particular, homeomorphic to a torus. Properties The existence of a taut foliation implies various useful properties about a closed 3-manifold. For example, a closed, orientable 3-manifold, which admits a taut foliation with no sphere leaf, must be irreducible, covered by \\\\mathbb R^3, and have negatively curved fundamental group.

Functional illiteracy is contrasted with illiteracy in the strict sense, meaning the inability to read or write simple sentences in any language. People who can read and write only in a language other than the predominant language of where they live may also be considered functionally illiterate. Definition Illiteracy, as well as functional illiteracy, were defined on the 20th session of UNESCO in 1978 as follows: The characteristics of functional illiteracy vary from one culture to another, as some cultures require better reading and writing skills than others. A reading level that might be sufficient to make a farmer functionally literate in a rural area of a developing country might qualify as functional illiteracy in an urban area of a technologically advanced country. In languages with phonemic spelling, functional illiteracy might be defined simply as reading too slow for practical use, inability to effectively use dictionaries and written manuals, etc. Links with poverty and crime In developed countries, the level of functional literacy of an individual is proportional to income level and inversely proportional to the risk of committing certain kinds of crime. For example, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics in the United States: * Over 60% of adults in the US prison system read at or below the fourth grade level * 85% of US juvenile inmates are functionally illiterate * 43% of adults at the lowest level of literacy lived below the poverty line, as opposed to 4% of those with the highest levels of literacy. Prevalence In the United States, according to Business magazine, an estimated 15 million functionally illiterate adults held jobs at the beginning of the 21st century. The American Council of Life Insurers reported that 75% of the Fortune 500 companies provide some level of remedial training for their workers. As of 2003, 30 million (14% of adults) were unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities. The National Center for Education Statistics provides more detail. Literacy is broken down into three parameters: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Each parameter has four levels: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient. For prose literacy, for example, a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information, while a person who is below basic in quantitative literacy would be able to do simple addition. In the US, 14% of the adult population is at the \\"below basic\\" level for prose literacy; 12% are at the \\"below basic\\" level for document literacy, and 22% are at that level for quantitative literacy. Only 13% of the population is proficient in each of these three areas‚Äîable to compare viewpoints in two editorials; interpret a table about blood pressure, age, and physical activity; or compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items. The UK government's Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47% of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional mathematics, and 42% fail to achieve a basic level of functional English. Every year, 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK. While in Russia, where more than 99% percent of the population is technically literate, only one-third of high school graduates can comprehend the content of scientific and literary texts, according to a 2015 study. Research findings A Literacy at Work study, published by the Northeast Institute in 2001, found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity, errors, and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy. Sociological research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of scientific literacy among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies. This correspondence suggests that the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship contributes to a society's level of civic literacy.SASE - Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics ‚Äî Civic Literacy: How Informed Citizens Make Democracy Work Henry Milner, Ume√• University and Universit√© Laval, accessed May 2006 See also * Aliteracy * Functional English * Health literacy * Literacy * Postliterate society * Scientific literacy References External links * Begin to Read * QuickReads Category:Knowledge Category:Reading (process) Category:Sociolinguistics Category:Literacy de:Analphabetismus#Definitionen und Differenzierungen ","title":"Functional illiteracy"},{"id":"1255349","text":"The bat falcon (Falco rufigularis) is a falcon that is a resident breeder in tropical Mexico, Central and South America, and Trinidad. It was long known as Falco albigularis; the names Falco fusco-coerulescens or Falco fuscocaerulescens, long used for the aplomado falcon, are now believed to refer to the present species. The female bat falcon, at 30.5 cm length, is much larger than the 23-cm-long male. Adults have a black back, head, and tail. The throat, upper breast, and neck sides are creamy white, the lower breast and belly are black, finely barred white, and the thighs and lower belly are orange. Young birds are similar, but with a buffy throat. The call of this species is a high pitched ke-ke-ke like the American kestrel. It is probably closely related to and looks like a small version of the orange- breasted falcon. These two, in turn, are probably closest to the aplomado falcon and constitute a rather old American lineage of Falco species.Probably diverging from their relatives some 8-5 million years ago, during the Late Miocene. See Birregard (1994), Helbig et al. (1994), Wink et al. (1998), Griffiths (1999), Groombridge et al. (2002), Griffiths et al. (2004) This small dark bird of prey inhabits open woodlands and forest clearings. Bat falcons perch conspicuously on high, open snags, from which they launch aerial attacks on their prey. They hunt bats, birds, small rodents and large insects such as dragonflies. The smaller male takes more insects, and the female more birds and bats. The flight is direct and powerful. This falcon is partly crepuscular, as the bats in its diet suggest. It lays two or three brown eggs in an unlined treehole nest. Notes  References * Beebe, C.

His middle name is spelled Lenox in census and family documents. Merchant Richardson was born in London in 1834. He relocated to Shanghai in 1853 to seek his fortune in the China trade. In 1862, Richardson announced his retirement from the world of business, and was en route back to England with his fortune when he stopped over at the treaty port of Yokohama in September 1862. Namamugi Incident After Richardson met Woodthorpe Charles Clarke, an old friend from Shanghai, they joined fellow merchant William Marshall, and Marshall's sister-in-law Margaret Watson Borradaile to go on a sightseeing ride via nearby Kanagawa town towards the temple of Kawasaki Daishi. While travelling on the T≈çkaid≈ç road ‚Äì the Imperial highway ‚Äì through the village of Namamugi (now part of Tsurumi ward, Yokohama), the party encountered the retinue of Satsuma regent daimy≈ç Shimazu Hisamitsu (otherwise Shimazu Sabur≈ç) heading in the opposite direction. When Richardson approached Shimazu's palanquin too closely, the daimy≈çs bodyguard attacked the Englishman. Marshall and Clarke were also severely wounded in the incident. Grievously wounded, Richardson fell from his horse a short distance from the attack and was killed with a coup de gr√¢ce on the orders of Shimazu. The British government demanded reparations following the Namamugi Incident. But when Shimazu resisted the order to pay, a squadron of Royal Navy ships bombarded Kagoshima during the brief Anglo-Satsuma War the following year. Burial Following an autopsy conducted by William Willis,Respect and Consideration: Britain in Japan 1853-1868 and Beyond, John W. Denney, Radiance Press, 2011, pp. 116, 443 who had joined the British mission in Japan in 1861, Richardson was buried in a private plot near the Yokohama Foreign Cemetery between the later graves of Marshall and Clarke. Reception Several accounts exist regarding the cause of the altercation in which Richardson was killed. Louis G. Perez, Ph.D, Professor of Japanese History at Illinois State University,https://history.illinoisstate.edu/faculty_staff/profile.php?ulid=lgperezhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170608041248/http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/outreach/educators/seminar/documents/PerezBio.pdf in Japan at War: An Encyclopaedia (2013), presents the following: per one account, the Britons were turning their horses around to yield the road when the Satsuma retainers attacked preemptively to maintain the order of the procession; this arose from \\"the language barrier and the retainers' anti- foreign zeal\\". Alternatively, it was claimed, Richardson and his cohort forced his way into the procession and were attacked by the retainers, outraged at the disrespect to their lord. In any case, the incident \\"reflects the widespread anti-foreign sentiment that had emerged among many Japanese people since the country was forced open in 1854.\\"Japan at War: An Encyclopaedia, ed. Louis G. Perez, ABC Clio (Santa Barbara, California; Denver, Colorado; Oxford, England), 2013, p. 261 John W. Denney, in Respect and Consideration: Britain in Japan 1853-1868 and Beyond (2011), also emphasises the differing accounts, noting that \\"the incontestable points are that Shimazu Sabur≈ç's samurai killed Richardson and severely wounded Marshall and Clarke\\". The latter two men, at the official inquest, claimed that although they noticed samurai ahead, they did not know they were part of a daimy≈ç's retinue; on turning a corner, they recognised they were \\"twelve men deep into the procession and close to the daimy≈ç\\", but as \\"none of the party had shouted or gesticulated at the Japanese in front of them\\", they were \\"confident that no hostile moves would be made by the samurai.\\" On attempting to turn around, a retainer struck Richardson with his sword, then inflicted a less severe wound on Marshall. Travelling at speed to escape the retinue, the men received further wounds. The accounts of the men and Mrs Borradaile were the only ones given until 1875, when American E. H. House, a campaigning journalist and writer, published a pamphlet giving the Satsuma version of the incident. House stated that Richardson was \\"notorious for his violent dealings with Chinese people during his residency in Shanghai\\", and his reputation had preceded him. He also claimed that, on passing Japanese acquaintances, Richardson's party had asked why they had dismounted (this being customary for the passing of the daimy≈ç), but not taken note of the response. In light of the \\"inexorable regulation\\" that \\"no casual passenger should continue to ride, either upon his horse or in any conveyance, during the occupancy of the road by a dignitary of high station\\", the Satsuma people felt that the English party ought to have observed this. No Japanese would have been permitted to ride through the procession; had the English party given no \\"offence other than that which might have proceeded from ignorance\\", they would have been unmolested; Richardson \\"had continued to push his horse in and out of the groups forming the cort√©ge\\", but had the party advanced in single file (rather than two abreast), \\"they could have passed uninjured, as others had done before them, and others did after\\".Respect and Consideration: Britain in Japan 1853-1868 and Beyond, John W. Denney, Radiance Press, 2011, pp. 71-79 In a 2013 article, Historian accused Richardson of cultural ignorance, arrogance, and racism, saying that, according to Japanese reports at the time, he disrespectfully rode in the middle of the road and even tried to get between the regent's litter and his bodyguards. Per Reichert, just before the incident, after Mrs Borradaile, concerned by signs of hostility from the retinue, begged him not to provoke them, Richardson allegedly said, \\"I have lived for fourteen years in China. I know how to manage these people.\\" (per Denney, this must have been \\"four years\\", as fourteen was not possible)Respect and Consideration: Britain in Japan 1853-1868 and Beyond, John W.

He also served as chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from 1979 to 1980  Early Life  Jay Van Andel was born on June 3, 1924 to James and Petronilla (Van der Woude) Van Andel in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His grandparents, Christian and Elizabeth had immigrated to America from the Netherlands in 1909. Van Andel's parents were devout Christians and were members of the Christian Reformed Church. Jay credits his Christian background as being foundational for the rest of his life as a Christian. He once wrote, \\"Christianity \\"involved the living out of Biblical values of honesty, generosity, and respect for others in our everyday life.\\" Jay attended Grand Rapids Christian High School. Later, Van Andel attended Calvin University and Pratt Business School in Kansas. When World War 2 broke out, Jay served as a United States Army Air Force officer. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and trained crews for B-17 and B-29 bombers that reached the Japanese mainland. Jay met Betty Jean Hoekstra while on a direct selling house call in the spring of 1951. Soon they were dating and they were married on August 16, 1952.  Amway  While attending the Grand Rapids Christian school before World War 2, Jay Van Andel met Rich DeVos. In 1949, Van Andel and DeVos became distributors of Nutrilite dietary supplements. They added cleaning products including Liquid Organic Cleaner, to their core line of products in 1958. In 1959, the \\"American Way Association\\" began in the basements of the Van Andel and DeVos homes, and later that year \\"Amway Sales Corporation\\" was formed. A converted service station became Amway's first outside office building in 1960.An Enterprising Life, by Jay Van Andel Today, Amway is a direct selling multinational company that sells a variety of health, beauty, and home care products. Amway went on to become the largest direct selling company in the world. Amway corporate reports that in 2019, they have over 3 million independent business owners (IBO's) in over 100 countries.  Van Andel Institute  In 1996, Van Andel founded Van Andel Institute with his wife Betty. The 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan and focuses on disease research and science education. Researchers look for ways to better diagnose and treat diseases, primarily cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. Education programs seek to inspire and prepare students to become the next generation of researchers. In 2019, the Van Andel Institute was led by Jay's son, David Van Andel as Chairman and CEO.  Philanthropy and public service  A strong supporter of the Republican Party, Van Andel contributed $2 million to the re-election campaign of President George W. Bush, and $475,000 to the Michigan State Republican Party (mostly for state legislature candidates) in 2004 alone. He was noted for his friendship with former President Gerald R. Ford, a native of Grand Rapids, who lamented his death and called him \\"a great family man and a worldwide leader in the business arena\\". Steve Forbes wrote about Van Andel, \\"Whether in business or philanthropy, Van Andel understood that the primary goal was to serve the needs and wants of other people. He exmplified the best of America.\\"Forbes magazine, 14 February 2005  Awards  In 1981, Van Andel received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1993, Jay Van Andel was honored with an Edison Achievement Award for his commitment to innovation throughout his career.  Death  Van Andel and his wife Betty both died in 2004; Betty had Alzheimer's disease, and Jay had Parkinson's.

Goode was born in Stewartville, Minnesota on November 21, 1862. Goode received his bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota 1889 and his doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1903. Later on in 1903, he was offered a position as a professor in the Geography Department at the University of Chicago (Haas and Ward 241, 243).  Evil Mercator  In 1908, Goode spoke at an American Association of Geographers meeting in Baltimore, USA about the creating an alternative to the ‚ÄúEvil Mercator‚Äù (Hass and Ward 244). The Mercator projection has severe distortion at the poles and northern latitudes. Goode merged the homolographic and sinusoidal projections at 40¬∞ 44‚Äô 11.8‚Äù N and S to make the Goode Interrupted Homolosine projection (Stienwand 1). The ‚Äúhomolo‚Äù coming from homolographic, and the ‚Äúsine‚Äù originating from sinusoidal. He calculated the latitude where the two projections had the same scale and therefore should be merged by overlaying the two projections on each other. Above and below 40¬∞ 44‚Äô 11.8‚Äù N and S respectively, the homolographic projection is used. Between those two latitudes the sinusoidal projection is inserted. The Interrupted Homolosine projection is a pseudo-cylindrical, equal area projection. Initially, Goode‚Äôs Homolosine projection did not have universal appeal. The United States not being at the center of the map challenged the cartographic culture of the time (Schulten 187).  Goode's Atlas  Two of Goode‚Äôs former students (Leppard and Espenshade) helped him create Goode‚Äôs School Atlas (later retitled Goode‚Äôs World Atlas), first published in 1923 by Rand McNally. Goode claimed that ‚Äú[E]very square inch in the map represents the same number of square miles of the earth‚Äôs surface as any other square inch in the map‚Äù (Schulten p187). The atlas is still published today, now in its 23rd edition. By 1928, under failing health and 66 years old, Goode had a heart attack. On August 5, 1932, John Paul Goode died at age 69 (Hass and Ward p. 246).  References  *Haas, William H., Ward Harold B. \\"J. Paul Goode\\".

He was adopted as a child by Hayashi Dokai, a physician in the service of the Tokugawa shogunate, from whom he received the family name \\"Hayashi\\", but he sometimes referred to himself as \\"Sat≈ç Tosabur≈ç\\". He learned English at the Hepburn Academy in Yokohama (the forerunner of Meiji Gakuin University). From 1866 to 1868, Hayashi studied in Great Britain at University College School and King's College London as one of fourteen young Japanese students (including Kikuchi Dairoku) sent by the Tokugawa government on the advice of the then British foreign minister Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby. Hayashi returned home in the midst of the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, and joined with Tokugawa loyalists led by Enomoto Takeaki, whom he accompanied to Hokkaid≈ç with the remnants of the Tokugawa fleet. He was captured by Imperial forces after the final defeat of the Republic of Ezo at the Battle of Hakodate and imprisoned in Yokohama. Released in 1871 by Kanagawa governor Mutsu Munemitsu, he was recruited to work for the Meiji government in 1871, and because of his language abilities and previous overseas experience was selected to accompany the Iwakura Mission to Europe and the United States in 1871‚Äì1873.  Government officer  Being a member of the Iwakura Mission in the Britain, he was instructed by Yamao Yozo to arrange appointment of the teaching staff for the Engineering Institution (Japan) in the end of 1872.Hayashi Tadasu: Ato wa Mukashi no Ki (Looking Back), p.47. He returned home with the staff lead by Henry Dyer as the principal, and endeavoured to set up the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokyo as an officer of the Engineering Institution of the Ministry of Public Works.  Political career  After the Ministry of Public Works was abolished, he moved to the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication, then was appointed governor of Kagawa Prefecture, and then of Hy≈çgo Prefecture. In 1891, he was appointed Vice- Minister for Foreign Affairs. He was elevated to the title of baron (danshaku) in the kazoku peerage in 1895. Hayashi was appointed as resident minister to the court of Qing dynasty China at the Japanese legation in Beijing, then resident minister to Russia in St Petersburg, and finally resident minister to Great Britain. While serving in London from 1900, he worked to successfully conclude the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and signed on behalf of the government of Japan on 30 January 1902. He was elevated to the title of viscount (shishaku) in February 1902. Countess Hayashi, photographed 17 March 1902 On 2 December 1905 Hayashi became the first Japanese ambassador to the Court of St James's, as diplomatic relations were upgraded between the Empire of Japan and the British Empire. He was accompanied by his wife, Misao Gamo. At that time Sir Claude MacDonald was Hayashi's opposite number in Tokyo. On becoming Foreign Minister in the first Saionji cabinet in 1906, Hayashi concluded agreements with France (the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907) and Russia (the Russo- Japanese Agreement of 1907 and Russo-Japanese Agreement of 1910). He served as Minister of Communications in the second Saionji cabinet and as interim Foreign Minister (1911‚Äì12). He was elevated to the title of count (hakushaku) in 1907.

Early life He was born in Borovichi, Borovichsky Uyezd, in the Novgorod Governorate on . Following graduation from the Imperial Alexander Lyceum in December 1872 Kokovtsov applied for admittance to Saint Petersburg State University to study law on the recommendation of Aleksandr Gradovsky, Nikolai Tagantsev and S. Pakhman, all notable legal authorities of the time. However, his father, who had promised to pay for his education suddenly died leaving the family in strained financial circumstances. As a result, instead of attending university he entered the civil service to provide him and his family an additional income. Civil service Kokovtsov was admitted as a candidate for a civil service position in the Imperial Ministry of Justice serving first in the statistical, then the legislative and finally in the criminal office. From 1879 to 1890 he served as Senior Inspector and Assistant Head of the Central Administration of Prisons. This period is noted for its prison reforms formulated by State Secretary K.K. Grot a senior member of the Imperial State Council. From 1890 to 1896, he served in the State Council as Assistant State Secretary, State Secretary and finally as Assistant Imperial Secretary where he worked primarily on matters reviewed by the Russian Imperial State Council's Department of State Economy. From 1896 to 1902 he served in one of the three Assistant Minister of Finance positions under Sergei Witte. After resigning from the position, he served as Imperial Secretary until his appointment as Minister of Finance in 1904. He resigned the next year when his former superior in the Finance Ministry, Witte, assumed the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Although not a Minister, he then played a substantial role in securing a loan that did nothing less than keep the Imperial government from having to devalue its currency and leave the gold standard, then was the basis of almost all financially stable, secure and modern countries. Kokovtsov returned as Minister of Finance in the cabinets of Ivan Goremykin (1906) and Peter Stolypin (1906‚Äì11). Kokovstov was an anti-Semite who believed the problem with Jews was not their 'backwardness' but the fact that they were 'so clever'. Kokovtsov succeeded Stolypin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers after Stolypin's assassination in 1911, while also maintaining his post as Minister of Finance, and held both offices until his retirement in 1914. Kokovtsov opposed to the appointment of Alexei Khvostov. In 1912 Kokovtsov asked the Tsar to authorize Grigori Rasputin's exile to Tobolsk. Nicholas refused: \\"I know Rasputin too well to believe all the tittle-tattle about him.\\"M. Rasputin (1934) My father, p. 70. Kokovtsov had offered Rasputin a substantial amount of money to leave for Siberia and ordered the newspapers not to mention his name in connection with the Empress. The Tsar dismissed Kokovtsov on 29 January 1914 for a \\"lack of control over the press\\". In domestic policy, Kokovtsov's time as Prime Minister saw the passage of two laws in 1912 that provided accident and sickness insurance to about 20% of workers. Retirement and later life Upon retiring, Kokovstov was invested with the title and rank of count. After the February Revolution, he moved to Kislovodsk. After the October Revolution of 1917, he was investigated by the Cheka but escaped with his family to Finland and eventually settled in Paris. He was a leading figure in Russian √©migr√© society until his death on 29 January 1943. In 1933, he published his memoirs, which describe his childhood and education as well as his early years in government service from 1903 to 1919. Relationship with Sergei Witte Witte states in his autobiography that while Kokovtsov was serving as one of his assistants, he was left alone to do the business he knew so well and that Kokovtsov was the source of several small but meaningful reforms in the finances of the Russian Empire. Much was made of Kokovtsov's differences with Witte which resulted in the two refusing to work with one another after 1905‚Äì06. The apparent cause of these differences were conflicts over courses of action in the preparation for peace talks with Japan, following the Russo-Japanese War; the changing of the government structure in the wake of widespread political unrest; Witte's opposition to several of Kokovtsov's policies as Minister of Finance during the Russo-Japanese War, and in an important loan negotiation that occurred in 1905‚Äì06. The differences were made public in the Council of State when one or the other would make comments in opposition to the other's viewpoint on various issues. Many historians have made the case that the differences were the result of Witte's desire to return to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister of Russia) and his knowledge that his long-time associate was one of his chief rivals for the position. Some speculate that the differences were actually rather minor and overstate since both men, despite being in opposing political camps, could safeguard the financial reforms that they worked together to implement in the 1890s and early 1900s. It is known that Kokovtsov visited Witte in 1915 during the illness that led to Witte's death and that Witte offered Kokovtsov the position of State Controller, a ministerial post, in his government. He was awarded Order of the White Eagle and Order of Prince Danilo I. References Further reading * Harcave, Sidney. (2004). Count Sergei Witte and the Twilight of Imperial Russia: A Biography.

Occupied by the Belgians during the East African Campaign of World War I, the territory was under military occupation from 1916 to 1922 and later became a Belgian-controlled Class-B Mandate under the League of Nations from 1922 to 1945. It was replaced by Trust Territory status under the auspices of the United Nations in the aftermath of World War II and the dissolution of the League but remained under Belgian control. Ruanda-Urundi was granted independence in 1962 as the two separate states of Rwanda and Burundi. History Ruanda and Burundi were two independent kingdoms in the Great Lakes region before the Scramble for Africa. In 1894, they were annexed by the German Empire and eventually became two districts of German East Africa. The two monarchies were retained as part of the German policy of indirect rule, with the Ruandan king (mwami) Yuhi V Musinga using German support to consolidate his control over subordinate chiefs in exchange for labour and resources. =Belgian military occupation, 1916‚Äì22= A Belgian Congo stamp overprinted for the Belgian Occupied East African Territories in 1916 World War I broke out in 1914. German colonies were originally meant to preserve their neutrality as mandated in the Berlin Convention, but fighting soon broke out on the frontier between German East Africa and the Belgian Congo around Lakes Kivu and Tanganyika. As part of the Allied East African Campaign, Ruanda and Urundi were invaded by a Belgian force in 1916. The German forces in the region were small and hugely outnumbered. Ruanda was occupied over April‚ÄìMay and Urundi in June 1916. By September, a large portion of German East Africa was under Belgian occupation reaching as far south as Kigoma and Karema in modern-day Tanzania and as far eastwards as Tabora. In Ruanda and Urundi, the Belgians were welcomed by many Africans who were opposed to the autocratic behaviour of the kings. The territory captured was administered by a Belgian military occupation authority (\\"Belgian Occupied East African Territories\\") pending an ultimate decision about its political future. An administration, headed by a Royal Commissioner, was established in February 1917 at the same time as Belgian forces were ordered to withdraw from the Tabora region by the British. =League of Nations mandate, 1922‚Äì46= Cathedral of Our Lady of Wisdom at Butare (formally Astrida) in Ruanda. Catholicism expanded rapidly under the Belgian mandate. The Treaty of Versailles in the aftermath of World War I divided the German colonial empire among the Allied nations. German East Africa was partitioned, with Tanganyika allocated to the British and a small area allocated to Portugal. Belgium was allocated Ruanda-Urundi even though this represented only a fraction of the territories already occupied by the Belgian forces in East Africa. Belgian diplomats had originally hoped that Belgian claims in the region could be traded for Portuguese territory in Angola to expand the Congo's access to the Atlantic Ocean but this proved impossible. The League of Nations officially awarded Ruanda-Urundi to Belgium as a B-Class Mandate on 20 July 1922. The mandatory regime was also controversial in Belgium and it was not approved by Belgium's parliament until 1924.William Roger Louis, Ruanda-Urundi 1884-1919 (Oxford U.P., 1963). Unlike colonies which belonged to its colonial power, a mandate was theoretically subject to international oversight through the League's Permanent Mandates Commission (PMC) in Geneva, Switzerland. After a period of inertia, the Belgian administration became actively involved in Ruanda-Urundi between 1926 and 1931 under the governorship of Charles Voisin. The reforms produced a dense road-network and improved agriculture, with the emergence of cash crop farming in cotton and coffee. However, four major famines did ravage parts of the mandate after crop failures in 1916‚Äì1918, 1924‚Äì26, 1928‚Äì30 and 1943‚Äì44. Ruandan migrant workers at the Kisanga mine in Katanga (Belgian Congo) To implement their vision, the Belgians used the existing indigenous power structure. This consisted of a largely Tutsi ruling class controlling a mostly Hutu population, through the system of chiefs and sub-chiefs under the overall rule of the two Mwami. The Belgian administrators believed that the Tutsi were superior and deserved power. While before colonization the Hutu had played some role in governance, the Belgians simplified matters by further stratifying the society on ethnic lines. Hutu anger at the Tutsi domination was largely focused on the Tutsi elite rather than the distant colonial power.Peter Langford, \\"The Rwandan Path to Genocide: The Genesis of the Capacity of the Rwandan Post-colonial State to Organise and Unleash a project of Extermination\\". Civil Wars Vol. 7 n.3 Musinga was deposed by the administration as mwami of Ruanda in November 1931 after being accused of disloyalty. He was replaced by his son Mutara III Rudahigwa. Although promising the League it would promote education, Belgium left the task to subsidised Catholic missions and mostly unsubsidised Protestant missions. Catholicism expanded rapidly through the African population in consequence. An elite secondary school, the Groupe Scolaire d'Astrida was established in 1929 but as late as 1961, shortly before independence arrived, fewer than 100 Africans had been educated beyond the secondary level. The policy was one of low-cost paternalism, as explained by Belgium's special representative to the Trusteeship Council: \\"The real work is to change the African in his essence, to transform his soul, [and] to do that one must love him and enjoy having daily contact with him. He must be cured of his thoughtlessness, he must accustom himself to living in society, he must overcome his inertia.\\"Mary T. Duarte, \\"Education in Ruanda-Urundi, 1946-61, \\" Historian (1995) 57#2 pp 275-84 =United Nations trust territory, 1946‚Äì62= Monument in Bujumbura commemorating Burundi's independence on 1 July 1962 The League of Nations was formally dissolved in April 1946, following its failure to prevent World War II. It was succeeded, for practical purposes, by the new United Nations (UN). In December 1946, the new body voted to end the mandate over Ruanda-Urundi and replace it with the new status of \\"Trust Territory\\". To provide oversight, the PMC was superseded by the United Nations Trusteeship Council. The transition was accompanied by a promise that the Belgians would prepare the territory for independence, but the Belgians felt the area would take many decades to be ready for self-rule and wanted the process to take enough time before happening. Independence came largely as a result of actions elsewhere. African anti-colonial nationalism emerged in the Belgian Congo in the late 1950s and the Belgians became convinced they could no longer control the territory. Unrest also broke out in Ruanda where the monarchy was deposed in the Rwandan Revolution (1959‚Äì1961). Gr√©goire Kayibanda led the dominant and ethnically defined Party of the Hutu Emancipation Movement (Parti du Mouvement de l'Emancipation Hutu, PARMEHUTU) in Rwanda while the equivalent Union for National Progress (Union pour le Progr√®s national, UPRONA) in Burundi attempted to balance competing Hutu and Tutsi ethnic claims. The independence of the Belgian Congo in June 1960 and the accompanying period of political instability further drove nationalism in Ruanda-Urundi and the assassination of the UPRONA leader Louis Rwagasore, also Burundi's crown prince, in October 1961 did not halt the movement. After hurried preparations, Ruanda-Urundi became independent on 1 July 1962, broken up along traditional lines as the independent Republic of Rwanda and Kingdom of Burundi. It took two more years before the government of the two became wholly separate.  Colonial governors  Ruanda-Urundi was initially administered by a Royal Commissioner (commissaire royal) until the administrative union with the Belgian Congo in 1926. After this, the mandate was administered by a Governor (gouverneur) located at Usumbura (modern-day Bujumbura) who also held the title of Vice- Governor-General (vice-gouverneur g√©n√©ral) of the Belgian Congo. Ruanda and Urundi were each administered by a separate resident (r√©sident) subordinate to the Governor. ;Royal Commissioners (1916‚Äì26) * (November 1916 ‚Äì May 1919) * (May 1919 ‚Äì August 1926) ;Governors (1926‚Äì62) * (August 1926 ‚Äì February 1929) * (February 1929 ‚Äì July 1930) * (July 1930 ‚Äì August 1932) * (August 1932 ‚Äì July 1946) * (July 1946 ‚Äì August 1949) * (August 1949 ‚Äì January 1952) * (January 1952 ‚Äì March 1955) * (March 1955 ‚Äì January 1962) For a list of residents, see: List of colonial residents of Rwanda and List of colonial residents of Burundi. ;Kings (abami) of Ruanda * Yuhi V Musinga (November 1896 ‚Äì November 1931) * Mutara III Rudahigwa (November 1931 ‚Äì July 1959) * Kigeli V Ndahindurwa (July 1959 ‚Äì September 1961, when the Ruandan monarchy was abolished.) ;Kings (abami) of Urundi * Mwambutsa IV Bangiricenge (December 1915 ‚Äì July 1966).

Originally a part of the Federal Theatre Project, it was directed by Orson Welles and produced by John Houseman. A Brechtian allegory of corruption and corporate greed, it includes a panoply of societal figures. Set in \\"Steeltown, USA\\", it follows the efforts of Larry Foreman to unionize the town's workers and combat wicked, greedy businessman Mr. Mister, who controls the town's factory, press, church and social organization. The piece is almost entirely sung-through, giving it many operatic qualities, although Blitzstein included popular song styles of the time. The WPA temporarily shut down the project a few days before it was to open on Broadway. To avoid government and union restrictions, the show was performed on June 16, 1937 with Blitzstein playing piano onstage and the cast members singing their parts from the audience.\\"Steel Strike Opera Is Put Off By WPA\\". The New York Times. June 17, 1937, p. 1 The original cast consisted of John Adair, Guido Alexander, Marc Blitzstein, Peggy Coudray, Howard Da Silva, George Fairchild, Robert Fransworth, Edward Fuller, Will Geer, Maynard Holmes, Frank Marvel, Charles Niemeyer, Le Roi Operti, Jules Schmidt, George Smithfield, Olive Stanton, and Bert Weston. The Cradle Will Rock was reprised January‚ÄìApril 1938 as part of the first season of the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory company founded by Welles and Houseman. An abridged version of the production was recorded and released in 1938, the first original cast recording ever made. Synopsis Setting: Steeltown, U.S.A. Act I Moll, a young prostitute, is thrown in jail when she refuses to accept money from a corrupt policeman. She is soon joined by the leaders of the Liberty Committee, an anti-union group mistakenly charged with pro-union activities. While the committee members call out for their patron, industrialist Mr. Mister, to free them, a vagrant named Harry Druggist befriends Moll and explains that he lost his business because of Mr. Mister. Harry then reveals how Mr. Mister came to dominate Steeltown: Years earlier, during World War I, Mr. Mister's wife pays the town priest, Reverend Salvation, to preach sermons supporting her husband's interests. Editor Daily, the head of the local newspaper, begins running articles attacking the steelworker's union and its leader, Larry Foreman, while also hiring the inept Junior Mister as a foreign correspondent. Gus Polack, a newly elected member of the union, is killed in a car bombing that also kills his wife and Harry's son Stevie. Harry is pressured to keep quiet and subsequently loses his business permit, falling into absolute despair. Act II Eventually, all of Steeltown's prominent citizens join the Liberty Committee, including Salvation, Daily, the painter Dauber, and the violinist Yasha. With their support, Mr. Mister's rule over the town is seemingly unshakeable. Later that night, Larry is arrested and beaten for distributing leaflets. He urges the others to join him and rise against Mr. Mister, saying that, in time, \\"the cradle will rock\\". A flashback shows Mr. Mister persuading President Prexy of Steeltown University to threaten students with expulsion if they do not join the army. Dr. Specialist, the chairman of the Liberty Committee, is told to cover up the death of a steelworker by writing it off as a drunken accident. He does so even when the worker's sister, Ella Hammer, confronts him knowing the truth. Later that evening, Mr. Mister arrives and bails out the committee members. He offers to pay off Foreman, but he refuses. As the committee jeers him, he defiantly declares that Mr. Mister's power over Steeltown will soon come to an end as the curtain falls.

S. Government property. Welles, Houseman and Blitzstein, seeking a way to privately produce the show, rented the much larger Venice Theatre and a piano just in time for the scheduled preview on June 16, 1937. The 600 audience members, who had gathered outside the Maxine Elliot Theatre for the preview, travelled 21 blocks north to the Venice Theatre; many were on foot. The sold- out house grew even larger when the show's creators invited people off the street to attend for free. The musicians' union refused to play for the show unless Houseman could provide their full salaries, and Actors' Equity Association stated that its members could not perform onstage at the new theatre without approval of the original producer (the federal government). The show's creators thus planned for Blitzstein to perform the entire musical at the piano. Just after beginning the first number, Blitzstein was joined by Olive Stanton, the actress playing Moll, from the audience. During the rest of the performance, various actors joined in with Blitzstein and performed the entire musical from the house.Block, Geoffrey.'The Cradle Will Rock' Enchanted Evenings, Oxford University Press US, 2004, , p. 117 According to The New York Times's description of the original production, \\"Persons who heard the opera's score and extracts last night carried no clear impression except that its theme was that steel workers should join a union.\\" Poet Archibald MacLeish, who was in the audience, \\"praised the 'vitality' of the Federal Theatre Project.\\"\\"Steel Strike Opera Is Put Off By WPA\\" The New York Times (abstract), June 17, 1937 Houseman determined that there were no legal restrictions on performing the musical with a new financial backer, and beginning on June 18, Helen Deutsch, press agent for the Theatre Guild, agreed to serve as the financial backer for The Cradle Will Rock; the actors received a two-week leave of absence from the WPA, and, in an agreement with Actors' Equity, Deutsch paid the 19 cast members $1500 for the two weeks' performances. Two days later, Houseman announced that, should the production prove successful, the two-week run would be continued indefinitely. Houseman also announced that the musical would continue to be performed with Blitzstein playing piano onstage and the cast members singing from the audience. He asserted that this made the audience feel like part of the show, stating, \\"There has always been the question of how to produce a labor show so the audience feels like it is a part of the performance. This technique seems to solve that problem and is exactly the right one for this particular piece\\". The success of the performance led Welles and Houseman to form the Mercury Theatre.The details of the first production were recounted by John Houseman in an introductory speech to a 1983 production by The Acting Company, recorded by Jay Records, and are also included in Houseman's memoirs. =Mercury Theatre= The Cradle Will Rock was presented by the Mercury Theatre as part of its inaugural season. On December 5, 1937, it opened in a reduced oratorio version on Sunday evenings at the Mercury Theatre, using the set for Caesar and two rows of chairs. The cast included Will Geer, Howard Da Silva, Hiram Sherman, a chorus of 12, and Marc Blitzstein at the piano. Presented by the Mercury Theatre and Sam H. Grisman, the oratorio version of The Cradle Will Rock moved to the Windsor Theatre January 4, 1938. In mid-February it returned to the Mercury Theatre and completed its 13-week run April 2, 1938.

Rupert Everett was cast to portray the 21-year-old Welles in the black-and-white feature film. Although the budget was reduced to $3 million, Welles was unable to secure funding and the project was not realized. \\"A couple of studio reports that I've read on the Cradle script seem characteristic,\\" wrote film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. \\"Both readers complain that the script assumes an interest in Welles's early life that they didn't happen to share.\\" The unproduced screenplay was published in 1994. Cradle Will Rock  In 1999 writer/director Tim Robbins wrote a semi-fictional film recounting the original production of The Cradle Will Rock. The film, entitled Cradle Will Rock (without \\"The\\") blended the true history of Blitzstein's show with the creation (and subsequent destruction) of the original Diego Rivera mural Man at the Crossroads in the lobby of Rockefeller Center (the Rivera mural was actually destroyed in 1934). Several of the original actors from the 1937 production were included as characters in the film, notably Olive Stanton, John Adair, and Will Geer, while others were replaced by fictional characters. Leading man Howard Da Silva was replaced by the fictional \\"Aldo Silvano\\" (John Turturro). Although Will Geer played Mr. Mister in the 1937 production, for the movie he was recast in the smaller role of the Druggist and a fictional actor named \\"Frank Marvel\\" (Barnard Hughes) portrayed Mr. Mister. The film's climax recreates scenes from the original, legendary performance of the show, performed by veteran Broadway performers Victoria Clark, Gregg Edelman, Audra McDonald, Daniel Jenkins, Erin Hill, and Chris McKinney. Robbins wrote a book, Cradle Will Rock: The Movie and the Moment, as a companion to the movie; it discusses the original show, his adaptation, and the filming of the motion picture.Robbins Recordings A slightly abridged version of Welles's 1937 Mercury Theatre production with narration by Blitzstein was recorded in April 1938 and released on the Musicraft label (number 18). It was the first original cast recording ever made and a digital version is now available through the Internet Archive. In December 1964 the recording was re-released in a limited-edition LP on the American Legacy Records label (T1001).Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum, This is Orson Welles.

It is von Trier's third theatrical feature film and the final film in his Europa trilogy following The Element of Crime (1984) and Epidemic (1987). The film features an international ensemble cast, including French-American Jean-Marc Barr, Germans Barbara Sukowa and Udo Kier, expatriate American Eddie Constantine, and Swedes Max von Sydow and Ernst-Hugo J√§reg√•rd. Europa was influenced by Franz Kafka's Amerika, and the title was chosen \\"as an echo\\" of that novel.Lars Von Trier: Interviews, pp. 82-83 Plot A young, idealistic American hopes to \\"show some kindness\\" to the German people soon after the end of World War II. In US-occupied Germany, he takes on work as a sleeping-car conductor for the Zentropa railway network, falls in love with a femme fatale, and becomes embroiled in a pro-Nazi terrorist conspiracy.

The voice-over narration uses an unconventional second-person narrative imitative of a hypnotist (e.g. \\"On the count of ten, you will be in Europa.\\"). The film's characters, music, dialogue, and plot are self-consciously melodramatic and ironically imitative of film noir conventions. Production The film was shot throughout Poland (Chojna Cathedral (Marienkirche) and the Chojna Roundhouse) and in Denmark (Nordisk Film studios, Copenhagen and the Copenhagen Dansk Hydraulisk Institut) Von Trier's production company, Zentropa Entertainments, is named after the sinister railway network featured in this film, which is in turn named after the real-life train company Mitropa. Reception Europa was released as Zentropa in North America to avoid confusion with Europa Europa (1990). =Critical reception= The film received largely positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85% score based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. =Accolades= The film won three awards at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival (Best Artistic Contribution, Jury Prize, and Technical Grand Prize). Upon realizing that he had not won the Palme d'Or, von Trier gave the judges the finger and stormed out of the venue. Home media The Criterion Collection released the film on DVD in 2008.

Although publicity material for the various Supermarionation series, and the TV Century 21 comic, made references to connections between the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet canons, Zero-X is the only official link between the two series. Construction The first manned craft to land on Mars, the metallic-blue Zero-X comprises a number of detachable sections. The main body houses the chemical engines which provide the craft with the thrust required for lift-off and the subsequent journey to Mars. The Martian Exploration Vehicle (MEV) is attached to the front of the main body where it serves as the spaceship's main control centre during spaceflight. During atmospheric ingress or egress, two remotely controlled \\"lifting bodies\\" (self-propelled \\"flying wing\\" aerofoils) are attached to the main body at the front and rear of the craft. Finally, a heatproof nose cone with an aluminium exoskeleton protects the MEV during take-off and provides further aerodynamic flow to the vehicle in atmospheric ascent; it is jettisoned just before leaving the Earth's atmosphere, and is the only non-reusable part of the spacecraft. The lifting bodies act as wings to allow the craft to operate from a runway like a conventional aeroplane, and carry multiple jet engines to reduce the amount of fuel needed for the main body's chemical engines. They separate from the main body when the craft is at a sufficiently high altitude and fly back to base; on re-entry, they rendezvous with the spacecraft and dock with it to again act as wings and provide propulsion in the atmosphere. On reaching Mars, the MEV detaches from the main body, which is left in orbit piloted by a single astronaut, and descends towards the planet's surface. At the surface the MEV extends caterpillar tracks to negotiate the rocky terrain.Thunderbirds Are Go (1966), Century 21 Cinema/United Artists. The concept of a reusable first-stage lifting body (or in this case, bodies) boosting a smaller spacecraft to high altitude for more efficient use of its propulsion was in direct competition with the vertical-ascent rocket doctrine of the 1960s as a means of achieving spaceflight, and for some time lost out to it, as even the Space Shuttlewhich landed as a conventional aircraftmakes a vertical rocket-powered ascent in the \\"classical\\" manner. In more recent years Virgin Galactic have re-established the concept, providing the first private commercial suborbital spaceflights in a similarly launched vehicle. The Zero-X contrasts in this way with Thunderbird 3, which, though nominally more advanced (hinted at because of its secrecy), is still a vertical-ascent rocket. Zero-X has a total delta velocity of 40 miles per second, a standard acceleration of 1 g, a maximum acceleration of 10 g, and an emergency acceleration of 15 g. It is built by New World Aircraft Corporation, the same company that made Skyship One. Appearances =Thunderbirds Are Go= The first manned mission to Mars ended in failure after the Zero-X spacecraft was accidentally sabotaged by the Hood, who had stowed aboard the craft to photograph its wing mechanisms. The crew managed to escape and two years later a second Zero-X craft successfully reached Mars in September 2067. However, soon after touching down on the surface, the MEV fired upon a Martian \\"rock snake\\" in the belief that it was a lifeless rock formation, provoking retaliation by fire-shooting rock snakes, resulting in the first open combat between humans and extraterrestrials. While the astronauts managed to escape, the lifting body control systems on board the MEV sustained damage during the confrontation, causing the Zero-X to crash upon its return to Earth, landing in Craigsville, United States (roughly 20 miles from its launch site, the fictitious Glenn Field Spaceport). The crew survived, having been saved at the last minute (quite literally) by International Rescue. In both missions, the Zero-X was manned by three crew and two scientists: * Paul \\"Skipper\\" Travers (Captain) (for the overall mission) - Travers, was modelled on Sean Connery, who was starring as James Bond at the time that Thunderbirds Are Go was made.Supermarionation: Captain Scarlet and Thunderbirds Puppets by Terry Curtis * Greg Martin (Space Captain) (for the flight) * Brad Newman (Space Navigator) * Dr Tony Grant (Astrophysicist) * Dr Ray Pierce (Astronomer) =Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons= Re-commissioned by the Spectrum Organisation, the Zero-X returned to Mars in 2068 in search of the source of alien signals detected from Earth. The crew's hostile actions led to a \\"war of nerves\\" with the Mysterons in Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. After tracing the signals to an alien city complex, the mission commander, Spectrum officer Captain Black, gave the order to fire upon the facility after mistaking imaging devices for weapons and fearing they were about to be attacked. Following the destruction, the three- man crew of the MEV witnessed the miraculous re-materialisation (\\"retro- metabolism\\", as it is termed in the TV series) of the Mysteron city, and for their act of aggression the Mysterons took control of Black's mind and body as the principal agent of their vengeance.Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967), Century 21 Television/ITC, Episode 1: \\"The Mysterons\\". It is never specified whether Black and the crew actually died on Mars. However, when the Zero-X returned to Earth, Black was its only occupant. He vanished upon landing at Glenn Field, and shortly after the Mysterons issued their first threat against Earth.Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Audio Adventure, MA-151: Introducing Captain Scarlet. Although the Zero-X does not appear in Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet (2005), a reference is made to it through the depiction of lifting bodies being used to assist spaceships in entering Earth orbit. =Thunderbirds Are Go, TV Series= The Zero-X appears in the reboot series episode \\"Signals, Part 1\\". During its launch, the Zero-X is stolen by the Hood for its light-speed engines however shortly after the engines go critical and threaten to create an Extinction-Level Event, Jeff Tracy boards the Zero-X and attempts to take control whilst the Hood ejects in an escape pod, Jeff Tracy attempts to take the Zero-X into space, shortly after there is a massive explosion and the ship is presumed destroyed along with Jeff Tracy. 8 years later an SOS is picked up from the Oort Cloud apparently from Jeff Tracy and International Rescue attempts to recover the Zero-X escape pod believing it to be the key to understanding how he survived and his current situation. After analysing the escape pod footage they determine that the witnessed explosion was actually an aftershock of the Zero-X's main engine firing at full power and that the Zero-X itself launched into space at near light speed. =Tie-in media= A series featuring the adventures of the crew of the Zero-X appeared in the comic TV Century 21 and its successors, including Countdown. A model of the Zero-X was included in the Project SWORD line of toys marketed by Century 21 Productions. Production AP Films commissioned Slough-based company Master Models to make two scale filming models of Zero-X. The larger of the pair, which was built at a cost of ¬£2,500, was long and weighed . The puppet set design of the cockpit was inspired by the interiors of the A√©rospatiale/BAe Concorde, a prototype of which the crew viewed at Filton Airfield. In 2012, the original MEV filming model, minus the cockpit canopy, was acquired by the prop restoration company The Prop Gallery, which commissioned the still-trading Master Models to refurbish the miniature that it had built 46 years prior. Reception According to spaceflight historian Jack Hagerty, the way in which the MEV is deployed from the mothership was inspired by both the titular spacecraft of the Andersons' earlier puppet series Fireball XL5 (whose cockpit section breaks off to form a lander, Fireball Junior) and the modular construction of the real-life Apollo spacecraft. He also states that the name \\"MEV\\" is based on \\"LEM\\" (Lunar Excursion Module), the original designation for the Apollo Lunar Module. Among other observations, Hagerty questions the names given for some of Zero-Xs components in Thunderbirds Are Go, stating that the craft's so-called nose cone \\"looks nothing like a cone\\" and that its lifting bodies do not meet the technical definition a lifting body. He also regards the brevity of the Martian landing as a flaw in the film's plot: \\"After spending, presumably, many years and billions of dollars mounting this expedition to Mars, all they get for their effort is a couple of hours driving around on the surface.\\" However, he calls the destruction of the Zero-X Mark II \\"one of the most spectacular crash sequences ever filmed\\". Stephen La Rivi√®re, in his book Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, calls Zero-X \\"the star of Thunderbirds Are Go\\", praising Derek Meddings' design and acknowledging its commercial nature: \\"... cynics would suggest that the various detachable segments (wings and nose cone) had less to do with the storyline and more to do with potential toy manufacturing!\\" Glenn Erickson of the website DVD Talk considers Zero-X \\"unwieldy\\" and aesthetically inferior to Skyship One from the sequel Thunderbird 6 (1968). Alasdair Wilkins of io9 questions the design of Zero-X in that it is \\"not especially aerodynamic-looking\\". He also notes the craft's protracted introduction in Thunderbirds Are Go, judging the film's 10-minute opening launch sequence excessively long: \\"It's pretty much the Alpha and Omega of launch sequences ... a sequence that threatens to make 2001 [: A Space Odyssey] look like non-stop, thrill-a-minute action.\\" He believes that with the attention to detail given to the various stages of the craft's assembly and take-off, these scenes constitute \\"launch sequence porn\\", elaborating: \\"It's a bunch of people effectively saying, 'Action? Characters? Humour? Nah, forget all that. We know what the people really want to see, and it's clearly the model-work.'\\" Hagerty states that notwithstanding the quality of Meddings' effects in this sequence, \\"there are limits to audience patience!\\" Mark Bould considers the sequence an example of the Anderson productions' \\"technophilic model-work\\".

Wells, which originally appeared in the December 1903 issue of the Strand Magazine. It features \\"land ironclads,\\" armoured fighting vehicles that carry riflemen, engineers, and a captain, and are armed with remote-controlled, semi-automatic rifles. (The term \\"ironclad\\" was coined in the mid-19th century for steam- propelled warships protected by iron or steel armour plates.) The land ironclads are described as \\"essentially long, narrow, and very strong steel frameworks carrying the engines, and borne on eight pairs of big pedrail wheels, each about ten feet in diameter, each a driving wheel and set upon long axles free to swivel around a common axis. [...] the captain [...] had look-out points at small ports all round the upper edge of the adjustable skirt of twelve-inch ironplating which protected the whole affair, and [...] could also raise or depress a conning-tower set above the port-holes through the centre of the iron top cover.\\" Riflemen are installed in cabins \\"slung along the sides of and behind and before the great main framework,\\" and operate mechanically targeting, semi-automatic rifles.H.G. Wells, \\"The Land Ironclads,\\" in The Short Stories of H.G. Wells (London: Ernest Benn, 1927), pp. 131‚Äì32. The story contributed to Wells's reputation as a \\"prophet of the future\\"In the first biography of Wells published after his death, Vincent Brome noted that Wells's reputation as a prophet was \\"one of the legends sustained by the newspaper world\\": \\"[Wells] foresaw the motor car, the tank, the aeroplaine and the atom bomb, he pictured the war in the war and he glimpsed‚Äîas no one else‚Äîa promised land as rich and full and bountiful as any vision vouchsafed Moses. But how he could blunder. London, Berlin, St. Peterburg would, he wrote, increase their populations to well over 20,000,000; and New York, Philadelphia and Chicago would probably and Hankow almost certainly reach 40,000,000. Anticipations implied that 'the struggle between any two naval powers on the high seas [...] will not last more than a week or so.' [...] In the same period he did not 'think it all probable that aeronautics will ever come into play as a serious modification of transportation and communication. [...]' As for the submarine, 'I must confess that my imagination in spite even of spurring, refuses to see any sort of submarine do anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea.' [...] Russia at one point would never amount to more than another vaster Ireland. Paranoiac leaders like Hitler were dramatically dismissed [...] No, he was a considerable, but not after all divinely inspired prophet.\\" H.G. Wells: A Biography (London: Longsmans, Green, 1951), pp. 235‚Äì36). when tanks first appeared on the battlefield in 1916. For contemporaries, Wells's rather sketchy battle between countrymen \\"defenders\\" (who rely on cavalry and entrenched infantry) and attacking townsmen carried echoes of the Boer War, as well as of his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds, which also featured a struggle between technologically uneven protagonists. Plot summary The story opens with an unnamed war correspondent and a young lieutenant surveying the calm of the battlefield and reflecting upon the war between two unidentified armies. The opponents are dug into trenches, each waiting for the other to attack, and the men on the war correspondent's side are confident they will prevail, because they are all strong outdoor-types ‚Äîmen who know how to use a rifle and fight‚Äîwhile their enemies are townspeople, \\"a crowd of devitalised townsmen . . . They're clerks, they're factory hands, they're students, they're civilised men. They can write, they can talk, they can make and do all sorts of things, but they're poor amateurs at war.\\"The Land Ironclads, H. G. Wells, 1909 The men agree that their \\"open air life\\" produces men better suited to war than their opponents' \\"decent civilization.\\" In the end, however, the \\"decent civilization,\\" with its men of science and engineers, triumphs over the \\"better soldiers\\" who, instead of developing land ironclads of their own, had been practising shooting their rifles from horseback, a tactic rendered obsolete by the land ironclads. Wells foreshadows this eventual outcome in the conversation of the two men in the first part, when the correspondent tells the lieutenant \\"Civilization has science, you know, it invented and it made the rifles and guns and things you use.\\" The story ends with the entire army captured by thirteen land ironclads, with the defenders managing to disable only one. In the last scene, the correspondent compares his countrymen's \\"sturdy proportions with those of their lightly built captors\\", and thinks of the story he is going to write about the experience, noting both that the captured officers are thinking of ways they will defeat what they call the enemy's \\"ironmongery\\" with their already- existing weaponry, rather than developing their own land ironclads to counter the new threat, and also noting that the \\"half-dozen comparatively slender young men in blue pajamas who were standing about their victorious land ironclad, drinking coffee and eating biscuits, had also in their eyes and carriage something not altogether degraded below the level of a man.\\" Inspiration Wells did predict the use of armoured vehicles in combat, but numerous authors (for example Sam Moskowitz in Science Fiction by Gaslight) mistakenly state that he described caterpillar treads on a tank before the tank's invention. In War and the Future, H. G. Wells specifically acknowledges Bramah Diplock's pedrail wheel as the origin for his idea of an all-terrain armoured vehicle in The Land Ironclads: Indeed, within the story itself, the war correspondent, upon his first sight of the machine's pedrails, recalls hearing about them from Diplock in person. According to one biographer, Wells originally got the idea for land ironclads using \\"pedrails\\" from an inventor J. W. Dunne, who spoke of \\"big fat pedrail machines\\" in a letter to Wells. Dunne also influenced Wells's novel The War in the Air (1908).Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), pp. 222 & 432.

A theory of pseudogroups was developed by √âlie Cartan in the early 1900s. It is not an axiomatic algebraic idea; rather it defines a set of closure conditions on sets of homeomorphisms defined on open sets U of a given Euclidean space E or more generally of a fixed topological space S. The groupoid condition on those is fulfilled, in that homeomorphisms h: U‚ÜíV and g: V‚ÜíW compose to a homeomorphism from U to W. The further requirement on a pseudogroup is related to the possibility of patching (in the sense of descent, transition functions, or a gluing axiom). Specifically, a pseudogroup on a topological space S is a collection Œì of homeomorphisms between open subsets of S satisfying the following properties.Kobayashi, Shoshichi & Nomizu, Katsumi. Foundations of Differential Geometry, Volume I. Wiley Classics Library. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York, 1996. Reprint of the 1969 original, A Wiley-Interscience Publication. . * For every open set U in S, the identity map on U is in Œì. * If f is in Œì, then so is f ‚àí1. * If f is in Œì, then the restriction of f to an arbitrary open subset of its domain is in Œì. * If U is open in S, U is the union of the open sets {Ui}, f is a homeomorphism from U to an open subset of S, and the restriction of f to Ui is in Œì for all i, then f is in Œì. * If f: U ‚Üí V and f ‚Ä≤: U ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí V ‚Ä≤ are in Œì, and the intersection V ‚à© U ‚Ä≤ is non-empty, then the following restricted composition is in Œì: :f' \\\\circ f \\\\colon f^{-1}(V \\\\cap U') \\\\to f'(V \\\\cap U'). An example in space of two dimensions is the pseudogroup of invertible holomorphic functions of a complex variable. The properties of this pseudogroup are what makes it possible to define Riemann surfaces by local data patched together. In general, pseudogroups were studied as a possible theory of Infinite-dimensional Lie groups. The concept of a local Lie group, namely a pseudogroup of functions defined in neighbourhoods of the origin of a Euclidean space E, is actually closer to Lie's original concept of Lie group, in the case where the transformations involved depend on a finite number of parameters, than the contemporary definition via manifolds. One of Cartan's achievements was to clarify the points involved, including the point that a local Lie group always gives rise to a global group, in the current sense (an analogue of Lie's third theorem, on Lie algebras determining a group). The formal group is yet another approach to the specification of Lie groups, infinitesimally. It is known, however, that local topological groups do not necessarily have global counterparts. Examples of infinite-dimensional pseudogroups abound, beginning with the pseudogroup of all diffeomorphisms of E. The interest is mainly in sub-pseudogroups of the diffeomorphisms, and therefore with objects that have a Lie algebra analogue of vector fields. Methods proposed by Lie and by Cartan for studying these objects have become more practical given the progress of computer algebra. In the 1950s Cartan's theory was reformulated by Shiing-Shen Chern, and a general deformation theory for pseudogroups was developed by Kunihiko Kodaira and D. C. Spencer. In the 1960s homological algebra was applied to the basic PDE questions involved, of over-determination; this though revealed that the algebra of the theory is potentially very heavy. In the same decade the interest for theoretical physics of infinite-dimensional Lie theory appeared for the first time, in the shape of current algebra.

A native of the Portland area, he served in the Oregon House of Representatives in the early 1890s before appointment as the United States District Attorney for Oregon. As the federal prosecutor, he became involved in the Oregon land fraud scandal, in which several high- profile public officials conspired to defraud the government in acquiring land for a private entity. Hall was convicted, but subsequently pardoned, for failing to prosecute some of the participants. Hall was also the father of Oregon governor John H. Hall.

Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 104-105. He was the son of Benjamin F. and Emily Hicklin Hall, though both parents died when he was ten, leaving him the family farm. Hall worked as a farm hand and for a railroad surveying crew while also receiving an education at both the Lafayette Academy and Portland High School.Colmer, Montagu, and Charles Erskine Scott Wood. 1910. History of the Bench and Bar of Oregon. Portland, Or: Historical Pub. Co. p. 145. When he turned 21 he returned to the family farm to run it, and in 1877 was married to Olive I. Powell. After getting married, the couple moved to Portland and opened a store, which he sold in 1885. Hall then read law for two years and passed the bar in October 1887. He then entered a legal partnership with W. E. Showers before appointment as a deputy district attorney in 1888 for Multnomah County.

He was married a second time December 25, 1895, to Jessie E. Belcher, and they had three children. In November 1897, Hall was appointed as the United States District Attorney for Oregon by U.S. President William McKinley. Oregon land fraud In 1903, U.S. Attorney General Philander Knox appointed Francis J. Heney to assist Hall in investigating allegations of land fraud in Oregon in a series of trials that became known as the Oregon land fraud scandal. Hall was uncooperative in the investigation, and was removed from office by President Theodore Roosevelt on January 1, 1905. In 1907, Heney put Hall on trial for failing to prosecute land companies engaging in fraudulent activities, and for using his knowledge of illegal activities to blackmail his political opponents. On February 8, 1908, a jury found Hall guilty of the charges. Later years He was later pardoned by President William Howard Taft for his role in the land fraud scandal. Hall returned to private legal practice in Portland after being forced out of office. He also was involved with the banking industry, owned three farms, and was an investor in power generation projects in Deschutes County. John Hicklin Hall died in Portland, Oregon, on July 27, 1937, at the age of 83 and was interred at River View Cemetery in Portland.

He served in World War I before going into business, where he was most successful as a car dealership owner in Salem. A Republican, he served as a city councilor and mayor of Salem before election to the Oregon State Senate. McKay served four terms in the state senate, also served stateside with the rank of major in the U.S. Army during World War II, and was then elected as the twenty-fifth governor of Oregon in 1948. He left that office before the end of his term when he was selected as the thirty-fifth U.S. Secretary of the Interior during the Eisenhower administration. Early life and business career McKay was born in Portland, Oregon, to farmer Edwin D. McKay and his wife Minnie A. Musgrove. His family's limited means required him to work while still a schoolboy. After his father's death in 1911, McKay was forced to leave school before receiving a high school diploma. He was admitted to Oregon State College in Corvallis as an agriculture student at the age of twenty. McKay was elected student body president in 1916. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree and married Mabel Christine Hill on March 31, 1917. They had one son and two daughters: Douglas, Shirley and Marylou McKay. In November of 1939, his son, Douglas Jr., died in an automobile accident. Douglas McKay papers, 1925-1958 PDF. (n.d.). Retrieved September 24, 2020, from http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv03770 During World War I, he served with the United States Army in Europe, where he advanced to the rank of first lieutenant. He sustained an injury in battle to his leg, right arm, and shoulder, which earned him a Purple Heart. Upon discharge, the disability prevented him from performing the strenuous activities involved with farming, so he began a business career in Portland selling insurance, and then automobiles, rising to the position of sales manager. After the move to the sales manager position, the company sent him to Salem, where he was in charge of their dealership in that city. He opened Douglas McKay Chevrolet Co. in 1927, and later started a Cadillac dealership as well. McKay later served as president of the Oregon Automobile Dealer's Association. Early political career McKay won election to several local political offices as a Republican, becoming mayor of Salem in 1932, and guided that city through fiscal troubles in the wake of the Great Depression. Steering his city into recovery, according to a contemporary journalist quoted by biographer Herbert S. Parmet, made McKay \\"a firm advocate of government as well as business preserving and guarding its financial foundation.\\" McKay was elected to the Oregon State Senate in 1934, serving four terms interrupted by service as a major in the Army during World War II. In 1940, he was an alternate delegate to the Republican National Convention, which nominated the Willkie-McNary ticket. Governor of Oregon He was elected governor in 1948 on a platform of fiscal conservatism and economic development. As Governor, McKay took a balanced approach to state government. He was a strong advocate for resource conservation; however, he also supported cutting of old growth timber to create jobs for Oregonians. McKay actively opposed the Federal Government's plan to create a Columbia Valley Authority. He supported legislation to turn over 95 percent of the profits from the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to the state's general fund with the remaining profits going to Oregon cities based on population. He advocated expanding Oregon's highway system, supporting a successful bond issue that raised $75 million for the Oregon State Highway Department. McKay won reelection as governor in 1950.\\"Earliest Authorities in Oregon\\", Oregon Blue Book, Oregon State Archives, Office of the Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, March 27, 2010. Tom McCall, who would later become governor, served as McKay's executive secretary and press officer between 1949 and 1951. Secretary of the Interior Secretary McKay and Dwight D. Eisenhower had significant ideological differences, the General being identified with the Republican moderates, and McKay with the conservative wing. Fearing that conservative Senator Robert A. Taft had little or no chance of winning the presidency in 1952, and admiring Eisenhower for his military record and leadership qualities, McKay supported Eisenhower's candidacy early in the campaign. Upon his election, Eisenhower appointed McKay as Secretary of the Interior. McKay resigned as Oregon governor on December 27, 1952. As the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, McKay proved himself a political asset and an effective administrator, largely because of his concern for natural resources in the western states balanced by fiscal and business acumen. As an administrator, he worked hard to balance the interests of conservationists and developers. He fostered partnerships involving the states, local public groups, private enterprise, and the Federal Government in building facilities and developing natural resources. During his tenure, McKay worked to prevent the Columbia Valley Authority and public development of the Hell's Canyon project. McKay created nine new wildlife reserves and he opposed the transfer of Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge property to the Army. However, he also advocated building a dam at Echo Park which would have flooded Dinosaur National Monument. In Oregon, he allowed the Alabama mining company to harvest timber; for that, his critics dubbed him, \\"Giveaway McKay.\\" He also supported Indian termination policy in 1954. In Washington, McKay abolished five divisions within the Interior Department, cutting four thousand positions and reducing the budget by nearly $200 million.\\"The Administration: The Old Car Peddler\\", Time (Vol. LXIV, No. 8), New York, New York, August 23, 1953.

Later years and legacy At the urging of Eisenhower, McKay resigned March 9, 1956, effective April 15, 1956, to challenge incumbent Wayne Morse for his seat in the United States Senate. He lost a fierce campaign, in no small measure because of the opposition he had engendered among Oregon conservation groups. Eisenhower replaced the more conservative McKay at Interior with a Moderate Republican, Fred Andrew Seaton, a former short-term senator from Nebraska. He died of heart attack in Salem, Oregon, at the age of sixty-six, and was interred at Belcrest Memorial Park in Salem.‚ÄúFinal Tribute Paid to Douglas McKay‚Äù, Tri-City Herald, Kennewick, Washington, July 26, 1959.

American journalist John Gunther described Snell as \\"genial, mediocre, and perpetually on the fence.\\" Early life and business career Snell was born on a farm near the small town of Olex, Oregon. He grew up in Arlington. He received a public school education, and attended Oregon Institute of Technology without attaining a degree. He became a partner in Arlington's automobile dealership. After military service during World War I, he settled in nearby Condon, where he married Edith Welshons, with whom he would have one son, and published the local newspaper.

Prevented by a term limit from seeking another term as Secretary of State, Snell decided to challenge his own party's incumbent Gov. Charles A. Sprague in the Republican primary. He received strong support from the state automobile dealers association, gained the nomination, and went on to be elected Governor with 78 percent of the vote, taking office on January 11, 1943. Generally recognized as a moderate, Snell's administration was marked by conservationist measures, public works projects and relief programs in line with the federal New Deal programs, and initiatives designed to promote agricultural, timber and industrial interests to expand Oregon's economy. He was re-elected in 1946, by a margin of more than two to one, but died in office the next year. Death On October 28, 1947, Snell, Oregon Secretary of State Robert S. Farrell, Jr., and State Senate President Marshall E. Cornett were killed along with pilot Cliff Hogue when their small plane crashed in stormy weather southwest of Dog Lake in Lake County, Oregon. The group left Klamath Falls about 10:00 p.m. en route to a ranch owned by Oscar Kittredge in Warner Valley near Lakeview, Oregon.\\"Governor, Top Aids Lost in Crash\\", Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon, 30 October 1947, p.1. A state funeral was held for Snell, Farrell and Cornett at the Capitol in Salem. Snell was buried in Salem's Belcrest Memorial Park.

The Sapotaceae are a family of flowering plants belonging to the order Ericales. The family includes about 800 species of evergreen trees and shrubs in around 65 genera (35-75, depending on generic definition). Their distribution is pantropical. Many species produce edible fruits, or white blood-sap that is used to cleanse dirt, organically and manually, while others have other economic uses. Species noted for their edible fruits include Manilkara (Sapodilla, sapota), Chrysophyllum cainito (star-apple or golden leaf tree), and Pouteria (abiu, canistel, l√∫cuma, Mamey sapote). Vitellaria paradoxa (shi in several languages of West Africa and karit√© in French; also anglicized as shea) is also the source of an oil-rich nut, the source of edible shea butter, which is the major lipid source for many African ethnic groups and is also used in traditional and Western cosmetics and medications. The 'miracle fruit' Synsepalum dulcificum is also in the Sapotaceae. Trees of the genus Palaquium (gutta-percha) produce an important latex with a wide variety of uses. The seeds of the tree Argania spinosa produce an edible oil, traditionally harvested in Morocco. The family name is derived from zapote, a Mexican vernacular name for one of the plants (in turn derived from the Nahuatl tzapotl) and Latinised by Linnaeus as sapota, a name now treated as a synonym of Manilkara (also formerly known by the invalid name Achras).

The central character of the series is said to be the 24th Phantom. It was aired from September 18, 1994 to March 3, 1996 in syndication. Story It is the year 2040, all environmental disasters and the economic Resource Wars from the early 21st century have decimated the fragile ecological balance of an Earth once teeming with life. Everywhere, the privileged and wealthy continue to thrive in expensive real estate developments that tower above the suffering masses. The victims of Earth's misfortune have been forced to subsist on scavenged refuse from the past on the mangled streets of forlorn city-states. In Metropia (once known as New York City), the largest and most powerful of the city-states, the powerful robotics manufacturing corporation Maximum Inc. has slowly shaped a cold, steely urban center, consisting of huge, residential towers intertwined with TubeTrain tunnels. Maximum's robotic \\"biots\\" (Biological Optical Transputer System) have replaced enormous amounts of human labour, and the corporation is illegally producing prohibited combat biots to form Maximum's private underground army. Under this guise of efficient progress, Maximum has own plans for the future, all known as the Maximum Era. Through the construction of the fortress of Cyberville, an immense survival shelter where only the wealthiest and most elite humans will retreat, and the take over of Metropia by Maximum's biot armies, their plans all ultimately involve the dark path of decline and extinction as the culminating result of man's prior errors and efforts, once Earth finally succumbs to its slowly deteriorating state. The only hope for the survival of humanity is the Ghost Jungle ‚Äî thousands of square miles of mutated vegetation that may be the planet's salvation. This secret source of life is submerged beneath Metropia, unseen by most. College student Kit Walker Jr. is chosen by fate to save the world, donning the black mask and purple suit of his people's savior, the 24th Phantom. The role of the Phantom has been passed on from father to son since the 16th century, leading the world to believe that the Phantom is a single immortal individual. Kit, the 24th in the line, is young, unsure, and inexperienced, but he finds within him the courage and might to battle the evil that threatens to destroy the Earth. Cast and characters Phantom 2040's voice cast included Scott Valentine, Margot Kidder, Ron Perlman, Leah Remini, J.D. Hall, Alan Oppenheimer, Richard Lynch and Jeff Bennett - while Mark Hamill, Debbie Harry, Rob Paulsen and Paul Williams had recurring roles. *Kit Walker, Jr. ‚Äì The 24th Phantom, Kit was not trained for the role like his ancestors were. His father died under mysterious circumstances when he was only a baby, and he grew up not knowing about his heritage. When Guran tells him about the Phantom on his eighteenth birthday, he is initially disbelieving, but takes on the role with increasing conviction. His equipment includes optical camouflage for invisibility, a wristband that contains a powerful computer (\\"analytical\\"), and another that contains a smart inductance rope. He has several vehicles, including a nimble airborne Hypercycle, a cloaking multi-passenger cruiser and an upgraded 1999 Mustang named \\"Hero\\", after the 21st Phantom's horse. After defeating Maximum Inc, he looks towards a long vacation, until the day the Phantom is needed again. Voiced by Scott Valentine. * Guran ‚Äì Kit's mentor, whose family have been aiding the Phantom for generations. Together with Jack Archer, Guran instructs the Phantom in combat, morality, and life itself, and is frequently seen reciting insightful \\"old jungle sayings\\" to Kit and others. After the 23rd Phantom's death, Guran blamed himself, and consumed in his sadness and self-hatred he became the legendary Shadow Panther, until he was freed from his mourning forever by Kit Walker Jr. Voiced by J. D. Hall. *Jack Archer ‚Äì A scientist and professor in biology at Kit's university. After Kit dons the identity of the Phantom, Archer takes only a short time to deduce that they are one and the same, and becomes one of the few who know the Phantom's true identity. Together with Guran, Archer takes on the role of Kit's mentor, particularly in scientific and contemporary parts of his education. Later on, (due to his wishes to work for the greater good like Kit), opens a small Detective agency like his family before him. Voiced by Alan Oppenheimer. * \\"Sparks\\" (Daniel Aguilar) ‚Äì A young, orphaned cyber-surfer who is rescued by Kit after Maximum mistakes Sparks as the Phantom. Sparks is unofficially adopted into the Phantom's lair, and assists in the technological parts of their endeavours. When he was three, his parents, Esteban and Mar√≠a, were kidnapped by Maximum and cruelly used as the mental tissue for the biomechanical \\"living building\\" Project Gauntlet, Cyberville's security system. Voiced by Pamela Adlon. * Sagan Cruz ‚Äì A Metropian policewoman or \\"Enforcer\\", who is attracted to Kit but was initially unaware of his dual identity, and was skeptical about the Phantom's motives. She later figures out his secret and eventually becomes Kit's love interest and partner. She has a genetically engineered police dog named D.V.L. (a reference to the 21st Phantom's wolf, Devil) and in combat dons a well-armoured Enforcer suit. Voiced by Leah Remini. * Heloise Walker ‚Äì Kit's only living relative, Heloise is the daughter of the 21st Phantom, the sister of the 22nd Phantom, the aunt of the 23rd Phantom, and the great-aunt of Kit Walker, Jr. ‚Äì The 24th Phantom. She kept the truth from Kit, hoping he could lead a normal life, but accepts Kit's choice to become the 24th Phantom and assists him in his plans to stop Maximum Inc. Voiced by Carrie Snodgress. * Rebecca Madison ‚Äì The series villain, chairperson of Maximum Inc. and widow of Maxwell Madison Sr., the 23rd Phantom's killer. Rebecca plans to construct Cyberville, a technological and impenetrable fortress where the select wealthy and elite may seek refuge when the Earth begins to deteriorate (something Rebecca's underground biot army will ensure takes place relatively soon), but her plans of domination are frequently being foiled by the Phantom. Despite her evil ways, she does have some redeeming qualities, such as wishing to know that her son is safe before evacuating from an attack, as well as Kit suggesting she is a very lonely woman. Other than Graft and her son, Maxwell Madison Jr., no other humans are employed by Maximum, which has its own biots perform all labour. In the end with all of her crimes revealed to the world, she is quickly arrested and sent to prison. Voiced by Margot Kidder. * Maxwell Madison Jr. ‚Äì Rebecca's sociopathic son, whose intelligence is belied by his laziness and outward disinterest in almost everything. When he does have an opinion on something, he presents it as coming from his cat, Baudelaire. He is psychologically disturbed with the disorders being rooted in the loss of his father at such an early age. His cat, perhaps the last remaining symbol of his father's love for him, is his only and most trusted friend. In the end after Rebecca is arrested both he and his cat, are sent to a mental asylum, or as Cruz put it, a \\"padded prison\\". Voiced by Jeff Bennett. * Hubert Graft ‚Äì Rebecca Madison's Chief of Security and main enforcer, a cyborg. He was formerly an environmentalist who turned and fought against Maximum to protect the Amazonian rainforest, before losing his whole body below the shoulders in combat. Maximum rebuilt Graft's body using biot parts, giving Rebecca Madison complete control over Graft's life. Graft's biot torso can be disconnected (a painful process) at the hip and integrated into other robotic systems over which Graft has complete control, most commonly the Urban Combat Biot Walker, a ten-foot steel exoskeleton armed with lasers and claws. Despite this, he still has a desire to protect nature, and will work with the Phantom if a bigger threat hits it. Several times the Phantom asks if he would want to escape Maximum's clutches, but he always turns this offer down. He also is against harming children, even if that child trespassed and destroyed invaluable company technology. In the end, after Maximum Inc is defeated, he is mentioned to have been sent to a half-way house. Voiced by Ron Perlman in the first season, and Richard Lynch in the second. * Doctor Jak ‚Äì A cynical sensationalist TV yellow journalist who reports the Phantom's activities with a negative spin. His arrogance and vanity bring him to believe that rather than being merely a reporter of news, he \\"is the news\\", and therefore anything he does not see (such as purposely covering his eye when it is revealed the Phantom was being framed) is not the news. In \\"Matter Over Mind\\", it is discovered that after Jak's wife perished in the Grand Central Station crash, he attempted an illegal operation to integrate an analytical computer into his mind, but the operation was interrupted and the analytical program thought lost. Dr. Jak was left part- biot, with sensory implants on his head and a multi-purpose eyepiece which he uses to film his news program, The Dr. Jak Show. His character and the way in which he criminalizes the Phantom are comparable to J. Jonah Jameson of Spider-Man. Voiced by Mark Hamill. * Mr. Cairo ‚Äì A mysterious information broker who only appears in holographic transmissions and who deals with both the Phantom and Maximum Inc. Early on, he discovers the Phantom's true identity, but chooses to withhold the information from Rebecca Madison despite the enormous reward being offered. He is later revealed to actually be the sentient analytical program separated from Dr. Jak's consciousness, but he decides not to rejoin Dr. Jak's mind and instead stays on to loyally assist the Phantom, though meets his end when Max Jr. shuts down the power with him still in it, deleting him. Voiced by Paul Williams. * Sean One ‚Äì The first human born in outer space and founder and leader of the Free Orbital Movement, Sean One seeks independence for his Orbital colonies. An arrogant and abnormally tall man, he resorts to espionage and terrorist attacks in order to achieve his ends and is unable to walk by himself while in the presence of gravity. He is revered among the Orbitals' inhabitants in an almost god-like way, and is extremely apathetic towards whom he calls the \\"gravity-slaves\\" of Earth. He is defeated when he publicly announced his plan to rig the votes to make the Orbital Colonies independent, as well as attempting to kill Vaingloria. Voiced by Rob Paulsen. * Gorda ‚Äì A morbidly obese crime lord and smuggler from Australia who is unable to move by herself and has an army of strong, red-tinted biots under her command. She refers to herself in third- person and has a well-armed robotic kangaroo as her sole companion. In the end she is arrested and transported back to Australia to await trial. Voiced by Paddi Edwards. * Heisenberg ‚Äì A shape-shifting fractal biot built by Max Madison Jr. using nanites grown in space by Sean One, named by Maxwell after the German physicist Werner Heisenberg. Heisenberg is the first stable fractal biot created by Maximum, and is controlled by Maxwell using a separate remote brain which must be carried around in a case. Heisenberg is forced to impersonate the Phantom and succeeds in criminalizing him with the help of Dr. Jak, but after a confrontation with the Phantom, Maxwell loses the remote brain and hence control of Heisenberg. Afterwards, the fractal biot gains independence and a form of sentience, dons a wide-brimmed hat and trench coat and seeks answers for his past, remembering nothing of his creation other than his name. He meets a wise street saxophonist named Betty, and after deciding to take his own path, becomes a \\"teacher\\" to biots everywhere, helping them to be free from their human owners and become self-aware. Heisenberg eventually joins the Phantom and becomes a close companion to Pavlova, Dr. Jak's assistant. Voiced by Rob Paulsen. * Pavlova - Dr. Jak's personal biot assistant, distinguishable by red symbols on her face. Pavlova sometimes questions the honesty and morality of Jak's news uploads, but always has her memory wiped by Jak afterwards (a task he does somewhat reluctantly). Nicknamed \\"Pav\\" by Jak, the reporter treats her as his friend and sometimes even in a joking, romantic way, because Pavlova was named after Jak's late wife. Pavlova also befriends Heisenberg, who takes an interest in her. She ultimately tells Jak \\"I will program myself from now on.\\" At which later Jak laments, \\"You just had to be your own person, just like her.\\" Referring to Pav' name sake. Voiced by Liz Georges. * Vaingloria ‚Äì A popular starlet singer trained by Maximum Inc. to brainwash the public. It is known that Rebecca Madison found her as a street urchin and offered her food, shelter and fame in exchange for her services for Maximum. Rebecca had her fitted with retractable mirrors which can focus light to such a strength that looking at the mirrors can overload the mind's senses, effectively hypnotizing the public into adoring her and on Maximum's orders using them to completely brainwash certain people (it can be assumed that the mirrors are difficult to control with precision, as Vaingloria once accidentally sent a victim into a coma). Vaingloria reluctantly takes part in several of Maximum's plots and becomes particularly close to Graft, who (somewhat) reciprocates. He ultimately hardwires her mirrors she can use them on her own. Voiced by Deborah Harry. * Betty ‚Äì A wise street saxophonist who becomes Heisenberg's best friend and companion. She is seen to be aware of everything around her and frequently relating life to the blues. She carries a saxophone that was property of an \\"unnamed\\" former U.S. president. Voiced by Iona Morris. * Maxwell Madison Sr. ‚Äì Rebecca's deceased husband, who was killed along with the 23rd Phantom in a toxic train wreck. Rebecca captures his brainwaves and stores them in an enormous computer, and is constantly seeking a stable way to transfer them into a biot or preferably a living body to effectively resurrect Maxwell Madison Sr. He was regarded as a very dangerous and power-hungry man when he was alive and in control of Maximum, Inc, but it is discovered that his plans for the world were very ecologically beneficial and that his ambitious wife Rebecca sabotaged his plans in favour of greedy, selfish world domination. Voiced by Jeff Bennett. Development The show was developed for television by executive producer David J. Corbett and executive story editors Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. In addition to story-editing both seasons, the Reeves-Stevens devised the show's writers' bible, and scripted numerous episodes, including the two-part pilot (Generation Unto Generation). Other key writers on the show included Brynne Stephens and Michael Reaves; despite the similarity of names, Reaves and Stephens are in no way related to the Reeves- Stevenses. The unusual character designs were the distinctive work of Peter Chung, creator of √Üon Flux. The show debuted in 1994 to rave reviews, though it survived only 35 episodes before it was relegated to weekend repeats in 1996. Along with action sequences, stories focused on intelligent plotting and character development, winning the series praise for its subtle teaching of such values as individuality, freedom and the volatility of humanity. Along with Andrea Romano's equally pioneering work on Batman: The Animated Series, Stuart M. Rosen's voice direction on Phantom 2040 had a lasting impact on animated adventure television. Romano and Rosen cast accomplished dramatic actors and introduced a new level of maturity and complexity to their show's vocal performances that set the standard for all TV animation that followed. Episodes In other media =Video game= A Phantom 2040 video game was produced for Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Super NES, and like the animated series, it received very positive reviews despite its obscurity. It is possible to play as both the Phantom and, in the Game Gear version, his alter- ego, Kit Walker. The game has over 20 different endings, depending on the choices the player makes while progressing through the story, and revolves around Rebecca Madison's attempts to create a biot army, revive her dead husband and seize control of both Metropia and the world. =Comic books= Phantom 2040 was adapted into a comic book series by Marvel Comics in 1995 (cover dated May‚ÄìAugust 1995). Only four issues were published, released as a mini-series. The stories were only loosely based on the TV series, and had a different tone than the dark, complicated animated show. The comic book was written by Peter Quinones, pencilled by Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko and inked by Bill Reinhold. Each issue featured a free poster drawn by such artists as John Romita Sr. Home media =VHS= Family Home Entertainment VHS Releases 1994/1995 (USA) A straight-to-video compilation titled Phantom 2040: The Ghost Who Walks was released in the USA on VHS by Family Home Entertainment in 1994 (and re-released on May 21, 1996). It is made up of the first five episodes of season 1 edited into a single movie. Family Home Entertainment subsequently released eight first-season episodes across four commercially available VHS tapes (in the USA) on August 22, 1995: 1) Generation Unto Generation Parts 1 and 2 2) Fire and I.C.E. / The Sum of the Parts 3) Dark Orbit Parts 1 and 2 4) The Ghost in the Machine / The Biot in Red =DVD= Lions Gate DVD Release 2004 (USA) Phantom 2040: The Ghost Who Walks was re-released on DVD by Lions Gate on September 21, 2004 and remains available for purchase in most counties as a US import.

In 2016, at the New York Toy Fair, Hasbro announced the return of the Stretch Armstrong toy in its original 1976 design. Stretch Armstrong is made of latex rubber filled with gelled corn syrup, which allows it to retain shape for a short time before shrinking to its original shape. Stretch Armstrong is an action figure shaped as a short, muscular, man with blond hair wearing black trunks. The doll's most notable feature was that it could be stretched from its original size of about to . If a tear did develop, it could be fixed with an adhesive bandage. Information on how to repair Stretch was provided in the toy's instruction booklet that was originally inside his box. History The Stretch Armstrong toy concept was created by Jesse D. Horowitz, the industrial designer for Kenner's R&D; group. The idea was approved for development by the head of R&D;, Jeep (James) Kuhn, vice president of Kenner. The \\"stretch man\\" idea as it was called was pursued with two different bodies in mind. One was a sumo wrestler and the other was an All-American blond hunk. Horowitz sculpted the models himself instead of hiring a freelancer. The sumo man was too bulky and large, so the All-American body was cast by Kenner's model maker Richard Dobek, and the resultant resin model was taken to a latex doll manufacturer in New Jersey, where the first bodies were dipped. Originally, springs were thought of as the way to stretch the man. However, they were thought to be too awkward and stiff, too difficult to insert and would likely pierce the skin. Kuhn, a chemical engineer, pursued a liquid sugar idea which eventually proved successful. Tremendous quantities of Karo corn syrup were purchased from an A&P; supermarket. The syrup was boiled down to get the proper viscosity. Kuhn and Horowitz flew to Kenner's headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, and presented the concept to Bernie Loomis, Kenner's president. He loved it and so a toy icon was born. The original Stretch Armstrong figure was conceived and developed by Bill Armasmith, and was in production from 1976 until 1980. Denys Fisher manufactured and released the figure in Europe, under license from Kenner. The original 1970s toy commands high prices on the secondary collectors' market, selling for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of US dollars. Through storage and play, the figure could become damaged and rendered useless. There are still original Stretch Armstrongs that have survived the passing of time and are remarkably preserved through sheer luck or being stored at the correct temperature. The figure keeps best at room temperature. Stretch Armstrong is made of latex rubber filled with gelled corn syrup, which allows it to retain shape for a short time before shrinking to its original shape. =Similar releases= An estimated 67 different versions from Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Australia, and other countries released Stretch Armstrong variations between 1976 and the 1990s.Stretch Armstrong World (retrieved January 23, 2012) * Stretch X-Ray (1977), had an oversized exposed brain and an alien-looking face with a transparent form that showed its internal organs which were lungs, an intestinal system and what appears to be a heart.

Wretch Armstrong seems to be a redesigned, smaller remake of Stretch X-Ray but in reality looks nothing like the 1970s version. Evil X-ray Wretch Armstrong is only 7 inches tall whereas Stretch X-ray was over 12 inches tall. Adaptations =Film= In 1994, Walt Disney Studios obtained the film rights to the character. Several scripts were written, including an early version family comedy written by Greg Erb, a co-writer at Disney. The script which cast Tim Allen in the role of Stretch Armstrong as a \\"kind of single dad who is a research scientist\\" and is \\"stretched too thin\\" trying to balance his work and family life before he inadvertently accidentally takes one of his experimental serums giving himself \\"stretchy powers\\". A later version from Screenwriter Michael Kalesniko was created and it was set in San Francisco. It was about a somewhat socially awkward nobody beset with troubles trying to venture out his failing personal life and is genetically modified with stretching abilities after a failed nuclear fusion experiment and must use his newfound abilities to solve the tragedy that has befallen his family. Among the actors who were considered for the role was Danny DeVito, who refused to do the film if the script made any jokes about his height, after which due to lack of time on the rights both ideas from Disney were scrapped and the rights were bought up by Hasbro. In 2008, Universal Studios signed a deal with Hasbro to create another film based on Stretch Armstrong from a screenplay written by Nicholas Stoller. It was announced from the studios co-chairman Donna Langley that Taylor Lautner would star as Armstrong and that the film would be in 3-D. She stated that \\"with Lautner's success energy and athleticism he is a perfect fit to a unlikely hero.\\" Producer Brian Grazer stated \\"Stretch Armstrong is a character I have wanted to see on screen for a long time ... It‚Äôs a story about a guy stretching ... the limits of what is possible to become all that he can be.\\" Another script was being made by writer Steve Oedekerk introducing the character in the form of an uptight spy who stumbles across a stretching formula, which he takes and now must adjust to his new found abilities when fighting crime and in his everyday life. Two years later, after the excitement drummed up by the Studios ideas for the character, Relativity Media announced that they had picked up the film after it was dropped by Universal and set a new release date of April 11, 2014. Planning to make the film more serious than originally intended by Universal, Relativity hired The Manchurian Candidate writer Dean Georgaris to write a new script,Relativity, Hasbro find 'Stretch' scribe dropped Lautner, and hired Breck Eisner to direct. The film origin story was going to introduce an overwhelmed high schooler and the life- or-death consequences he was going to face after undergoing a transformation granting him superhuman abilities. Production was scheduled to start filming on May 15, 2013, in Montreal but by October 2013, both the studio and Hasbro had abandoned the film to work on other projects.Relativity Abandons 'Stretch Armstrong' Movie =Television= After four attempted films for Stretch Armstrong, Hasbro Studios made a deal with the video streaming service website Netflix where the property was picked up for a full 26-episode animated series, making it the first deal between the company and the streaming service.

Her accolades include three Canadian Screen Awards and one Daytime Emmy Award. Though she appeared in an array of film and television roles, Kidder is most widely known for her performance as Lois Lane in the Superman film series, appearing in the first four films. Born in Yellowknife to a Canadian mother and an American father, Kidder was raised in the Northwest Territories as well as several other Canadian provinces. She began her acting career in the 1960s appearing in low-budget Canadian films and television series, before landing a lead role in Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx (1970). She then played twins in Brian De Palma's cult thriller Sisters (1973), a sorority student in the slasher film Black Christmas (1974) and the titular character's girlfriend in the drama The Great Waldo Pepper (1975), opposite Robert Redford. In 1977, she was cast as Lois Lane in Richard Donner's Superman (1978), a role that established her as a mainstream actress. Her performance as Kathy Lutz in the blockbuster horror film The Amityville Horror (1979) gained her further mainstream exposure, after which she went on to reprise her role as Lois Lane in Superman II, III, and IV (1980‚Äì1987). The 1990s were marked by significant health problems for Kidder: In 1990, she sustained serious injuries in a car accident that left her temporarily paralyzed, and she later had a highly publicized manic episode and nervous breakdown in 1996 stemming from bipolar disorder. By the 2000s she maintained steady work in independent films and television, with guest- starring roles in Smallville, Brothers & Sisters, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and The L Word, and appeared in a 2002 Off-Broadway production of The Vagina Monologues. In 2015, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for her performance in the children's television series R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour. In 2005, Kidder became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She was an outspoken political, environmental and anti-war activist, and continued to participate in political and activist causes through the end of her life. Kidder died on May 13, 2018, at her home in Livingston, Montana, aged 69, in what was later ruled a suicide by alcohol and drug overdose.  Early life  Margaret Ruth Kidder, one of five children, was born on October 17, 1948, in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, the daughter of Jocelyn Mary \\"Jill\\" (n√©e Wilson), a history teacher, and Kendall Kidder, an explosives expert and engineer.Published in the Vancouver Sun and/or The Province, June 7, 2008 Kidder was born in Yellowknife because of her father's employment, which required the family to live in remote locations. Her father subsequently served as the manager of the Yellowknife Telephone Company from 1948 to 1951. Her mother was Canadian, from British Columbia, while her father was an American originally from New Mexico. She was of Welsh and English descent. She had one sister, Annie, who is a Canadian actress and executive director of the People for Education charity, and three brothers: John, Michael and Peter. Two of her siblings married notable Canadian personalities: Annie to actor Eric Peterson, and John to politician Elizabeth May. Kidder's niece Janet Kidder is also an actress. Recalling her childhood in northern Canada, Kidder said: \\"We didn't have movies in this little mining town. When I was 12 my mom took me to New York and I saw Bye Bye Birdie, with people singing and dancing, and that was it. I knew I had to go far away. I was clueless, but I [have done] okay.\\" In addition to Yellowknife, she also spent some time growing up in Labrador City, Newfoundland and Labrador. Kidder became interested in politics from a young age, which she credited to debates her parents would have over the dinner table during her childhood; her mother was Canadian with socialist leanings, while her father was originally from the United States, and was a conservative Republican. Kidder suffered with mental health issues from a young age, which stemmed from undiagnosed bipolar disorder. \\"I knew I was different, had these mind flights that other people didn't seem to have,\\" she recalled. At age 14, she attempted suicide by swallowing a bottle of codeine capsules after her then-boyfriend broke up with her. Kidder found an outlet in acting as she felt she could \\"let my real self out... and no one would know it was me.\\" \\"Nobody ever encouraged me to be an actress,\\" she recalled. \\"It was taken as a joke ... As a teenager, I envisioned myself in every book I read. I wanted to be Henry Miller and Thomas Wolfe. I wanted to eat everything on the world's platter, but my eyes were bigger than my stomach.\\" She attended multiple schools during her youth through her family's relocations, eventually graduating from Havergal College, a boarding school in Toronto, in 1966. In 1966, she found herself pregnant with her boyfriend who arranged to have an illegal abortion. The abortionist was located in a hotel room and filled Kidder's uterus with Lysol to terminate the pregnancy. After graduating from Havergal, Kidder relocated to Vancouver to attend the University of British Columbia, but dropped out after one year. She returned to Toronto, where she found work as a model.

She subsequently appeared in a number of TV drama series for the CBC, including guest appearances on Wojeck, Adventures in Rainbow Country, and a semi-regular role as a young reporter on McQueen, and as a panelist on Mantrap which featured discussions centered on a feminist perspective.

Kidder had been in a relationship with De Palma at the time, and had been roommates with co-star Jennifer Salt in Los Angeles.

Variety praised her performance in the latter film as \\"outstandingly rich.\\" In the summer of 1975, Kidder was hired to direct a documentary short chronicling the making of The Missouri Breaks (1976), a Western film starring Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson. \\"I was such a jerk,\\" she recalled. \\"I mean, I thought they wanted a real documentary. So I filmed all the behind-the-scenes rows and arguments and shot footage of the vet shooting up the horses with tranquilizers so the actors would look as if they rode well. What an idiot I was. Then when they fired me, I realized what they'd wanted was a publicity film.\\" She subsequently co-starred with Peter Fonda in 92 in the Shade (also 1975), a drama directed by novelist Thomas McGuane, based on his own book. While filming, Kidder became romantically involved with McGuane, and in March 1975 relocated with him to Livingston, Montana.

Kidder as Lois Lane in Superman (1978), widely considered her most iconic role Eager to return to acting, Kidder read for the character of Lois Lane in the 1978 superhero film Superman: The Movie, in the spring of 1977, only one month before principal photography was scheduled to begin. Kidder was subsequently flown to England for screen-tests. Upon meeting with director Richard Donner, Kidder tripped while walking into the room. Donner recalled: \\"I just fell in love with her. It was perfect, this clumsy [behavior].\\" She was ultimately cast in the role, which would become her most iconic. Filming lasted approximately eighteen months. Superman was released during Christmas 1978 and was a major commercial success, grossing $300 million worldwide. Kidder won a Saturn Award for Best Actress for her performance, which was deemed \\"most charming\\" by Vincent Canby in The New York Times. After completing filming for Superman, Kidder starred as Kathy Lutz in the supernatural horror film The Amityville Horror (1979), which further cemented her status as one of Hollywood's leading ladies. The Amityville Horror was a major commercial success, grossing over $86 million in the United States, but it received mixed reviews from critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times, though giving the film a mixed review, said Kidder \\"stubbornly remains the bright-eyed life of the party [in the film].\\" In retrospect, Kidder called the film \\"a piece of shit.\\" The same year, Kidder hosted an episode of the American sketch comedy TV show Saturday Night Live. On August 25, 1979, she married actor John Heard, but the couple separated only six days into their marriage. Their divorce was finalized on December 26, 1980. Kidder reprised her role as Lois Lane in Superman II (1980), though she publicly disagreed with the decision of producers Alexander Salkind and Ilya Salkind to replace Richard Donner as director. Superman II was also a box-office hit, grossing $108 million in the United States. Through her appearances in the Superman films, Kidder maintained a close friendship with her co-star Christopher Reeve, which lasted from 1978 until his death in 2004: \\"When you're strapped to someone hanging from the ceiling for months and months, you get pretty darned close,\\" Kidder told CBS. \\"He was such a huge part of my life... He was complicated, very smart, really smart, and he knew he'd done something meaningful. He was very aware of that and very happy with that role.\\" Also in 1980, she appeared in Paul Mazursky's romantic comedy Willie & Phil, playing one-third of a love triangle opposite Michael Ontkean and Ray Sharkey. = 1981‚Äì1988: Career re-evaluation = Kidder starred in the Canadian comedic road movie Heartaches (1981), portraying a free-spirited woman who helps an acquaintance raise her child. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted: \\"Nothing happens in Heartaches that isn't telegraphed 15 minutes ahead of time, but Miss Kidder and Miss [Annie] Potts are good fun to watch, not because they convince you of the reality of their characters but because they handle their assignments with such unbridled, comic, actressy enthusiasm.\\" She then starred opposite Richard Pryor in the comedy Some Kind of Hero (1982), about a Vietnam War veteran who attempts to re-assimilate into civilian life. While filming the picture, Kidder stated she \\"fell in love with Pryor in two seconds flat,\\" and the two carried on a relationship during the production. Prior to this, Kidder was romantically linked to Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau in the early-1980s. In 1982, she appeared in a stage performance of Bus Stop, playing Cherie opposite Tim Matheson as Bo, which was broadcast on HBO. It was reported that, as a result of Kidder's previous objection to Donner's directorial replacement for Superman II, her role in 1983's Superman III was notably small, consisting of 12 lines and less than five minutes of footage, though the producers have denied this in DVD commentaries. The same year Superman III was released, Kidder also starred as a court stenographer-cum-private eye named Mickey Raymond in the comedy Trenchcoat (1983). Critic Roger Ebert disliked the film, deeming it \\"one of the most tired, predictable, uninteresting movies in a long time.\\" Also in 1983, Kidder produced and starred as Eliza Doolittle in a version of Pygmalion with Peter O'Toole for Showtime. Kidder subsequently produced and starred in the French-Canadian period television film Louisiana (1984) as a plantation owner in the American South who returns from Paris to find her estate and holdings have been lost. Kidder began dating the film's director, Philippe de Broca, and the two married in France in 1983. Her marriage to de Broca lasted one year, ending in divorce in 1984. Kidder later characterized the marriage as \\"impulsive, I'm afraid. Not a little irresponsible. We just weren't meant to be married to each other.\\" In 1984, she reunited with her former Nichols co-star, James Garner, in the Hollywood crime drama The Glitter Dome, and appeared in the drama Little Treasure for Columbia Tri-Star, with co-stars Ted Danson and Burt Lancaster, in which she played a distraught stripper looking for her bank robber-father's buried fortune. In 1985, Kidder expressed ambivalence toward continuing her career, and was quoted as saying: \\"I don't feel comfortable as a performer and I'm a big turkey as a movie star.\\" She would subsequently state that the quote was reported out of context, but conceded: \\"I am in a weird frame of mind at the moment. I know acting is not going to be enough for me for the rest of my life. This business is very hard on women at a certain age, and I never want to end up just having to accept what's offered me. So I am anxious to direct, to have options.\\" In 1986 she was selected as the English narrator for the Japanese animated series The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Kidder subsequently reprised her Lois Lane role in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), which she filmed in 1986.

In December that year, Kidder was seriously injured in a car accident on the set of the television series Nancy Drew and Daughter which left her partially paralyzed as a result of spinal injury. She was unable to work for two years, causing her financial difficulties, resulting in debts of over $800,000. Kidder attempted to sue the Canadian producer, Nelvana, for $1 million in damages but did not receive a settlement, and her launching of the suit rendered her ineligible for Canadian workers' compensation. Kidder returned to the screen with an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy film Delirious (1991), appearing as a woman in a washroom. This was followed by a role as a psychic in To Catch a Killer (1992), a Canadian television thriller film based on the crimes of John Wayne Gacy.

In April 1996, she experienced a widely publicized manic episode in Los Angeles. At the time, Kidder had been working on an autobiography when her laptop computer became infected with a virus, which caused it to crash and her to lose three years' worth of drafts. Kidder flew to California to have the computer examined by a data retrieval company, who ultimately was unable to retrieve the files. She entered a manic state and disappeared for four days. She was later found by a homeowner in the backyard of a Glendale residence, and was taken by the Los Angeles Police Department to Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center in a distressed state, the caps on her teeth having been knocked out during a rape attempt. She was subsequently placed in psychiatric care.

Kidder became a United States citizen on August 17, 2005, in Butte, Montana, and settled in Livingston. She said that she decided to become an American citizen to participate in the voting process, to continue her protests against U.S. intervention in Iraq, and to be free of worries about being deported. In 2008, she portrayed an embattled guidance counselor in the gay-themed mystery film On the Other Hand, Death, as well as a supporting role as Laurie Strode's therapist, in Rob Zombie's Halloween II (2009).

Stine's The Haunting Hour.  Activism and politics  Kidder was a longtime supporter of the U.S. Democratic party and voiced her support for liberal causes throughout her career. She actively supported Jesse Jackson's bid for the Democratic nomination in the 1984 United States presidential election. In the early 1990s, during the first Gulf War, Kidder was branded a \\"Baghdad Betty\\" and subjected to abuse for her remarks questioning the war. In a piece called \\"Confessions of 'Baghdad Betty'\\", styled as a letter to her mother and printed in The Nation, Kidder responded by explaining and defending her statements. As of November 2009, Kidder was the Montana State Coordinator for Progressive Democrats of America. The organization's website carried her article \\"Ax Max\\", in which she criticized Max Baucus, Montana's Democratic senator. She also contributed articles to CounterPunch, a left-wing magazine, beginning in 2009.

In 2012, she appeared in a video for Stop the Frack Attack, an environmental organization working toward regulating hydraulic fracturing (\\"fracking\\") practices. When discussing sustainable energy, Kidder said: \\"The first thing people have to start facing, contrary to the advertising fed to us by oil and gas companies, is that environmentalism and economic stability go hand-in-hand on any long term basis.\\" Kidder spent the winter of the 2016‚Äì2017 residing in a tent at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. In addition to environmental causes, Kidder was a vocal supporter of LGBT rights, and in 2003 hosted benefits at a gay and lesbian health center in Boston, Massachusetts.

Kidder's friends have related that she had suffered from poor health in recent years, particularly following her lengthy stay at the Standing Rock protest camp in 2016, often enduring frigid temperatures. DC Comics stated on its Twitter feed: \\"Thank you for being the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with. RIP, Margot Kidder\\". After her death, Kidder's close friend, director Ted Geoghegan, stated: Kidder was cremated, and her ashes were scattered by her brother John in childhood-favorite locations in Canada, as well as in Montana, amongst lilies often eaten by grizzly bears, partially fulfilling Kidder's wish to \\"have her body just left out there for the bears\\". She was survived by her daughter, Maggie, and two grandchildren from Maggie's marriage to novelist Walter Kirn.

Medical Knowledge Self- Assessment Program (MKSAP-15): Rheumatology. \\"Systemic Vasculitis.\\" Pg. 65‚Äì67. 2009, ACP. with massive intimal fibrosis and vascular narrowing, most commonly affecting young or middle-age women of Asian descent, though anyone can be affected. It mainly affects the aorta (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and its branches, as well as the pulmonary arteries. Females are about 8‚Äì9 times more likely to be affected than males. Those with the disease often notice symptoms between 15 and 30 years of age. In the Western world, atherosclerosis is a more frequent cause of obstruction of the aortic arch vessels than Takayasu's arteritis. Takayasu's arteritis is similar to other forms of vasculitis, including giant cell arteritis which typically affects older individuals. Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aorta, including the left common carotid artery, the brachiocephalic artery, and the left subclavian artery, Takayasu's arteritis can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the \\"pulseless disease.\\" Involvement of renal arteries may lead to a presentation of renovascular hypertension. Sign and symptoms Some people develop an initial \\"inflammatory phase\\" characterized by systemic illness with signs and symptoms of malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, fatigue, and fainting. Fainting may result from subclavian steal syndrome or carotid sinus hypersensitivity. There is also often anemia and marked elevation of the ESR or C-reactive protein (nonspecific markers of inflammation). The initial \\"inflammatory phase\\" is often followed by a secondary \\"pulseless phase\\". The \\"pulseless phase\\" is characterized by vascular insufficiency from intimal narrowing of the vessels manifesting as arm or leg claudication, renal artery stenosis causing hypertension, and neurological manifestations due to decreased blood flow to the brain. Of note is the function of renal artery stenosis in the causation of high blood pressure: Normally perfused kidneys produce a proportionate amount of a substance called renin. Stenosis of the renal arteries causes hypoperfusion (decreased blood flow) of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, resulting in exaggerated secretion of renin, and high blood levels of aldosterone, eventually leading to water and salt retention and high blood pressure. The neurological symptoms of the disease vary depending on the degree; the nature of the blood vessel obstruction; and can range from lightheadedness to seizures (in severe cases). One rare, important feature of the Takayasu's arteritis is ocular involvement in form of visual field defects, vision loss, or retinal hemorrhage. Some individuals with Takayasu's arteritis may present with only late vascular changes, without a preceding systemic illness. In the late stage, weakness of the arterial walls may give rise to localized aneurysms. As with all aneurysms, the possibility of rupture and vascular bleeding is existent and requires monitoring. In view of the chronic process and good collateral development, Raynaud's phenomenon or digital gangrene are very rare in Takayasu arteritis. A rare complication of this condition are coronary artery aneurysms. Blood flow pulse wave in the central retinal artery (red) and vein (blue), measured in the eye fundus of a patient with Takayasu arteritis by laser Doppler imaging. Laser Doppler imaging by near-infrared digital holography can reveal characteristic blood flow waveforms in the central artery and vein of the retina in patients with vascular insufficiency who may exhibit a smooth systo- diastolic pulse in the central retinal artery. This technique enables non invasive functional microangiography by high-contrast measurement of endoluminal blood flow profiles in vessels in the posterior segment of the eye with a spatial resolution comparable to state-of-the-art indocyanine green angiography. Pathophysiology gadolinium MRI in a patient with Takayasu arteritis showing thickened, enhancing aortic wall, consistent with large vessel vasculitis Although the cause of Takayasu arteritis is unknown, the condition is characterized by segmental and patchy granulomatous inflammation of the aorta and its major derivative branches. This inflammation leads to arterial stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms. There is irregular fibrosis of the blood vessels due to chronic vasculitis, leading to sometimes massive intimal fibrosis (fibrosis of the inner section of the blood vessels).John Barone, M.D. USMLE Step 1 Lecture Notes. \\"Vascular Pathology.\\" 2008, Kaplan Inc. pg 101. Prominent narrowing due to inflammation, granuloma, and fibrosis is often seen in arterial studies such as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or arterial angiography (DSA). =Genetics= The genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of Takayasu's arteritis is supported by the genetic association with HLA-B‚àó52. A 2013 large collaborative study uncovered multiple additional susceptibility loci for this disease, increasing its number of genetic loci to five risk loci across the genome. About 200,000 genetic variants were genotyped in two ethnically divergent Takayasu's arteritis cohorts from Turkey and North America by using a custom-designed genotyping platform (Immunochip). Additional genetic variants and the classical HLA alleles were imputed and analyzed. The study identified and confirmed two independent susceptibility loci within the HLA region (r2 < 0.2): HLA-B/MICA (rs12524487, OR = 3.29, p = 5.57 √ó 10-16) and HLA-DQB1/HLA-DRB1 (rs113452171, OR = 2.34, p = 3.74 √ó 10-9; and rs189754752, OR = 2.47, p = 4.22 √ó 10-9). In addition, a genetic association was identified and confirmed between Takayasu's arteritis and the FCGR2A/FCGR3A locus on chromosome 1 (rs10919543, OR = 1.81, p = 5.89 √ó 10-12). The risk allele at this locus results in increased mRNA expression of FCGR2A. In addition, a genetic association between IL12B and Takayasu arteritis was established (rs56167332, OR = 1.54, p = 2.18 √ó 10-8). A fifth genetic locus for the disease in an intergenic region on chromosome 21q22 downstream of PSMG1 was revealed (P=4.39X10-7). A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified genetic susceptibility loci for Takayasu arteritis with a genome- wide level of significance in IL6 (rs2069837) (odds ratio [OR] 2.07, P = 6.70 √ó 10(-9)), RPS9/LILRB3 (rs11666543) (OR 1.65, P = 2.34 √ó 10(-8)), and the intergenic locus on chromosome 21q22 (rs2836878) (OR 1.79, P = 3.62 √ó 10(-10)). The genetic susceptibility locus in RPS9/LILRB3 lies within the leukocyte receptor complex gene cluster on chromosome 19q13.4, and the disease risk variant in this locus correlates with reduced expression of multiple genes including the inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor gene LILRB3 (P = 2.29 √ó 10(-8)). In addition, this study identified additional candidate susceptibility genes with suggestive levels of association (P < 1 √ó 10(-5)) including PCSK5, LILRA3, PPM1G/NRBP1, and PTK2B. Another gene associated with this condition is MLX (Max-like protein X) Tamura N, Maejima Y, Matsumura T, Vega RB, Amiya E, Ito Y, Shiheido-Watanabe Y, Ashikaga T, Komuro I, Kelly DP, Hirao K, Isobe M (2018) Single-nucleotide polymorphism of the MLX gene is associated With Takayasu arteritis. Circ Genom Precis Med 11(10):e002296. doi: 10.1161/CIRCGEN.118.002296. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the demonstration of vascular lesions in large and middle-sized vessels on angiography, CT scan, magnetic resonance angiography or FDG PET.RA Watts et al., \\"Vasculitis in Clinical Medicine, 2010\\" Seeing abnormal diffuse arterial wall thickening, the 'macaroni sign', with ultrasound is highly suggestive of the condition. FDG PET can help in diagnosis of active inflammation not just in patients with active Takayasu arteritis prior to treatment but also in addition in relapsing patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. Contrast angiography has been the gold standard. The earliest detectable lesion is a local narrowing or irregularity of the lumen. This may develop into stenosis and occlusion. The characteristic finding is the presence of \\"skip lesions,\\" where stenosis or aneurysms alternate with normal vessels. Angiography provides information on vessel anatomy and patency but does not provide information on the degree of inflammation in the wall. The age at onset helps to differentiate Takayasu's arteritis from other types of large vessel vasculitis. For example, Takaysu's arteritis has an age of onset of <40 years, while giant cell arteritis has an age of onset >60 years. Takayasu arteritis is not associated with ANCA, rheumatoid factor, ANA, and anticardiolipin antibodies. Treatments Most people with Takayasu‚Äôs arteritis respond to steroids such as prednisone. The usual starting dose is approximately 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight per day (for most people, this is approximately 60 milligrams a day). Because of the significant side effects of long-term high-dose prednisone use, the starting dose is tapered over several weeks to a dose which controls symptoms while limiting the side effects of steroids. Promising results are achieved with mycophenolate and tocilizumab.Singh, Ambrish et al., Efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in treatment of Takayasu arteritis: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Mod Rheumatol. 2020;31:1-20 doi: 10.1080/14397595.2020.1724671 If treatment is not kept to a high standard, long-term damage or death can occur. Patients who do not respond to steroids may require revascularization, either via vascular bypass or angioplasty and stenting. Outcomes following revascularization vary depending on the severity of the underlying disease. History The first case of Takayasu‚Äôs arteritis was described in 1908 by Japanese ophthalmologist Mikito Takayasu at the Annual Meeting of the Japan Ophthalmology Society.M. Takayasu. A case with peculiar changes of the central retinal vessels. Acta Societatis ophthalmologicae Japonicae, Tokyo 1908, 12: 554. Takayasu described a peculiar \\"wreathlike\\" appearance of the blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina). Two Japanese physicians at the same meeting (Drs. Onishi and Kagoshima) reported similar eye findings in individuals whose wrist pulses were absent. It is now known that the blood vessel malformations that occur in the retina are an angiogenic response to the arterial narrowings in the neck and that the absence of pulses noted in some people occurs because of narrowings of the blood vessels to the arms. The eye findings described by Takayasu are rarely seen in patients from North America and British Columbia.

(styled as WHY?) is an American alternative hip hop and indie rock band. The band was founded in 2004 by Cincinnati rapper and singer Yoni Wolf, who had been using Why? as his stage name since 1997. In addition to Wolf, who serves as lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist, the band consists of multi- instrumentalists and backing vocalists Doug McDiarmid and Matt Meldon, and drummer and backing vocalist Josiah Wolf, who is Yoni Wolf's older brother. The band has released six studio albums, along with several extended plays, demo albums, and live albums, since their inception. Their first album, 2005's Elephant Eyelash, came two years after Yoni Wolf's final solo release as Why?. They followed this album with Alopecia (2008), Eskimo Snow (2009), Mumps, Etc. (2012), Moh Lhean (2017), and AOKOHIO (2019). History In 2004, Yoni Wolf enlisted his older brother Josiah, Doug McDiarmid, and Matt Meldon and formed Why?. At this time, he stopped using 'Why?' as his personal stage name. Why? released their debut album Elephant Eyelash in 2005. The album deviated considerably from the sound of Yoni Wolf's final solo project under the Why? moniker, the 2003 album Oaklandazulasylum, expanding to the sound of a full indie rock band. The group toured much of 2005 in support of the album as a four-piece. By the time of their May 2006 tour with Islands, the group had become a three-piece because Matt Meldon moved to San Juan Island off the coast of Washington to live with his girlfriend. In 2008, the group added bassist Austin Brown to their lineup, making them a four-piece once again. Why? performing a live show at Cafe Bourbon Street in Columbus, Ohio in 2008 For their second album, Alopecia, Why? asked the fans to contribute photographs of their palms for the album's artwork. They released \\"The Hollows\\" as the first single with two different European and US versions, featuring remixes and covers by Boards of Canada, Xiu Xiu, Dntel, Half-handed Cloud, Dump and Islands. Alopecia was released in 2008 to very positive reviews. In 2009, Why? released their third album Eskimo Snow. The ten songs on the album were recorded during the Alopecia sessions and are described by Yoni Wolf as \\"the least hip-hop out of anything I've ever been involved with.\\" On June 27, 2012, the band announced via Stereogum that they would be releasing their new EP Sod in the Seed on August 13 on City Slang. In the same article, they premiered the title track. The song is more upbeat than any of the tracks on Eskimo Snow and contains rapping, which had been absent on the previous album. Mumps, Etc., their fourth album, was released on October 9, 2012. In 2013, the band released an EP entitled Golden Tickets on the Joyful Noise label. The Golden Tickets EP is \\"a collection of personalized 'theme songs' for and about seven specific WHY? fans. Over the course of several months, Yoni and Josiah Wolf internet-stalked these fans for the purpose of crafting musical homages which would end up on this album.\\" One track on the album focuses on an individual's Twitter feed, while Dropjaw lipreads the verbal meanderings of a fan who sent them a soundless video of himself talking into a camera.

He identified as a Liberal, later Liberal Unionist, MP who sat in the House of Commons from 1885 to 1898. Ferdinand had a sister, Miss Alice, who like her brother was a keen horticulturalist and collector. She inherited Ferdinand's property, Waddesdon Manor, in 1898 after he died and likewise continued the tradition of using the house as a place to keep his impressive collections. Life and political career Vanity Fair caricature of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the House of Commonsalt=left Although Ferdinand de Rothschild was born in Paris in 1839, he was from Vienna and a member of the Rothschild banking family of Austria. He was the second son of the Viennese Baron Anselm von Rothschild (1803‚Äì1874) and his English wife Charlotte von Rothschild n√©e Rothschild (1807‚Äì1859).House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1886 Ferdinand's great- grandfather was the Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Although possessing the hereditary title Freiherr (Baron) from the Austrian nobility, he was familiarly referred to as 'Ferdy' by his sister, Miss Alice and friends. When Ferdinand became a British subject and moved from Vienna to London, \\"[he] epitomised the expanding lifestyle of the fourth generation\\". This statement is more evident when, on 7 June 1865 he married his second cousin Evelina de Rothschild (1839‚Äì1866), the daughter of Lionel de Rothschild (1808‚Äì1879). On 4 December 1866 their son was stillborn, and Evelina died later the same day. In her memory, Ferdinand built, equipped and endowed the Evelina Hospital for Sick Children in Southwark, south London. From 1868 to 1875, he became Treasurer of the Jewish Board of Guardians and Warden of the Central Synagogue in 1870.Thornton, Dora (2001), \\"From Waddesdon to the British Museum: Baron Ferdinand Rothschild and his cabinet collection\\", p. 57, Journal of the History of Collections, 2001, Volume 13, Issue 2, pp. 191‚Äì213, During these roles, Ferdinand instigated an offer of ¬£2,000 which ultimately led to the foundation of the Army Reservists' Home. In 1883, Ferdinand de Rothschild was High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire. He was adopted as Liberal candidate for the London constituency of St George's in the East but on being invited, he contested in 1885 another seat, at Aylesbury which he won and held until his death. In 1886, over the issue of Irish Home Rule, he joined the Liberal Unionists, and hosted meetings at Waddesdon Manor (where Joseph Chamberlain, Arthur Balfour and Lord Randolph Churchill were often guests) that led to the formation of the Unionist-Conservative alliance. From 1896 he was a Trustee of the British Museum, a role suggested by Sir Augustus Wollaston FranksThornton (2015), 18-19, 53-54 and leads to his Renaissance collection becoming bequested to the British Museum after his death. This is now exhibited as the Waddesdon Bequest. Ferdinand de Rothschild died at Waddesdon Manor on his 59th birthday, and thought to be the result of a cold caught when last visiting his wife's tomb. Ferdinand de Rothschild was buried next to his wife in the Rothschild Mausoleum in the Jewish Cemetery at West Ham.  Collecting  Waddesdon Manor was the weekend 'party house' of Ferdinand de Rothschild, where he entertained many famous and royal guests whilst showing off his diverse 19th century collection. Fluent in three languages, and considered \\"as much at home in Paris as in London\\", Ferdinand was an already inspired collector of eighteenth-century French decorative arts from his early twenties. For instance, when he was only 21 years old his first purchase was made on one of the most ostentatious rococo S√®vres ship vases from the Louis XV era. His development into one of the most renowned collectors of the 19th- century, even amongst the Rothschilds' is known by the abundance of family letters in which he is referred to as \\"curiosity-hunting... all over Europe\\". In the autumn of 1874, Ferdinand de Rothschild bought land in the village of Waddesdon in Buckinghamshire from the Duke of Marlborough in order to build a property in which he could house his diverse collection. From 1874 and 1889, architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur designed and built Waddesdon Manor, a 19th-century manor based on the 16th-century French Chateau de Chambord. He sought to 'revive the decoration of the eighteenth century in its purity, reconstructing the rooms out of old material, reproducing them as they had been during the reigns of Louis'. His collection of Renaissance objets d'art from the house was bequeathed to the British Museum; the Holy Thorn Reliquary being a highlight of the collection, though its distinguished provenance was still unknown. He willed the Manor to Alice Charlotte von Rothschild, his unmarried younger sister, who had lived with him there. Yet, 'towards the end of his life, Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild became increasingly concerned about the future of Waddesdon Manor', shown here in his quote from The Red Book: > \\"A future generation may reap the chief benefit of a work which to me has > been a labour of love, though I fear Waddesdon will share the fate of most > properties whose owners have no descendants, and fall into decay.

It is administratively a part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and provides teaching hospital facilities for London South Bank University and King's College London School of Medicine. Formerly housed at Guy's Hospital in Southwark, it moved to a new building alongside St Thomas' Hospital in Lambeth on 31 October 2005. History Plaque at the site of the old hospital in Southwark Bridge Road A mother and daughter visit a small boy at the hospital, 1882 The hospital was founded in 1869 (as Evelina Hospital for Sick Children) by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, whose wife, Evelina, and their child had died in premature labour. It was established in a purpose-built hospital in Southwark Bridge Road, Southwark, opposite what was originally the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade at 94 Southwark Bridge Road. It was brought under the management of Guy's Hospital in 1947 and became part of the National Health Service in 1948. In 1976 the original hospital building was closed, and the children's wards were moved to the newly built Guy's Tower. In 1999 a decision was made to re-establish Evelina Children's Hospital as a new specialist hospital for all children's services at Guy‚Äôs and St Thomas', in Lambeth, on the site of a former nurses' home. An architectural design competition was managed by RIBA Competitions and won by Hopkins Architects and engineers Buro Happold. Davis Langdon provided quantity surveying and employer's agent services. Construction began in 2002, and the building was completed in 2004, ready for fitting out. The building won the IStructE Award for Education or Healthcare Structures in 2006. In the same year, after a Europe-wide heatwave, the building's project team were recalled following reports of high indoor temperatures. In 2018, it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge would become the hospital's patron. Funding Although a part of the NHS, the ¬£60 million building cost of the new Evelina London Children's Hospital was largely paid for with private funds, with ¬£50 million coming from the independent Guy's and St Thomas' Charity (the successor to the endowments of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, amongst others), and ¬£10 million from NHS budgets and a major fundraising campaign by the Evelina London Children's Hospital Appeal. South Thames Retrieval Service South Thames Retrieval Service (STRS) is a children's acute transport service which specialises in the inter-hospital transfer of critically ill children in London (south of the River Thames). It operates from the children's intensive care unit of the Evelina London Children's Hospital. The unit is the lead centre for children's intensive care in the South Thames region and manages the clinical network for children's (paediatric) intensive care via the retrieval service, in conjunction with the intensive care units at St George's Hospital and King's College Hospital. With one phone call to the emergency number, a clinician in a South Thames hospital, can source clinical advice, a PICU bed and a transport team as necessary. STRS can then also coordinate specialist service input (e.g. cardiology).

Early history Regular government postal service is known from the Zhou dynasty in the 1st millennium BC. During the Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan in the 12th century, China was integrated into the much larger Mongolian √ñrt√∂√∂ system. Marco Polo reported that there were 10,000 post stages during that time. In addition, private letters were carried by the Min Hsin Chu, a system of letter guilds (hongs). Later the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta with Russia provided for the first regular exchange of mail. Qing Dynasty Although postal service in China goes back some 2,500 years, modern postal services were not established until 1877 by the Qing government. This 1-candareen stamp of 1885 has an unidentified seal cancellation and a postmark from the French post office in Shanghai A 1/2-cent value of the 1897 issue, lithographed in Japan. Great Qing Land Post A policy of isolation was forcibly ended in the 19th century by the Opium War and the subsequent opening of treaty ports; several nations opened foreign post offices from 1844 on. This expanded to involve dozens of cities, mostly on the coast, along the Yangtze River, and in the far south. Shanghai organized its own Shanghai local post in 1865. In the same year, the Irishman Robert Hart developed a mail service for the Imperial Maritime Customs, initially to carry consular mail to and from treaty ports. This service was opened to the public on 1 May 1878, and China's first postage stamps, the \\"Large Dragons\\" (),Institute of Chinese Studies, University of Heidelberg, Germany: Shelfmark: HE6185.C55 T33 1989title: Â§ßÈæçÈÉµÁ•®ËàáÊ∏Ö‰ª£ÈÉµÂè≤ / ‰∏≠ÂúãÈÉµÁ•®ÂçöÁâ©È§® Á∑® Ta-lung yu-p'iao y√º Ch'ing-tai yu-shih / Chung-kuo yu-p'iao po-wu-kuan pien Published: È¶ôÊ∏Ø : ÂïÜÂãôÂç∞Êõ∏È§® Hsiang-kang : Shang-wu yin-shu-kuan, 1989 Description: 212 p.: col. ill. .

The stamps were inscribed \\"CHINA\\" in both Latin and Chinese characters, and denominated in candareens. Initially, all mail to foreign destinations went through Shanghai, but by 1882 there were twelve post offices. On 20 March 1896, an edict directed that the Customs Post become the Imperial Postal Service effective 1 January 1897; the Min Hsin Chu was shut down, as well as the Shanghai local post, and postal system adopted cents and dollars as the units of currency. Through the first half of 1897, new stamps were unavailable, and so the existing stock was surcharged in cents, with several variants distinguished by philatelists. Revenue stamps were surcharged as well. The first new stamps, inscribed IMPERIAL CHINESE POST went on sale 16 August 1897. The twelve values, ranging from 1/2c to $5, were lithographed in Japan. The low values depicted a dragon, the middle values a carp, and the dollar values a wild goose. The paper used for these stamps had a watermark in the form of a yin-yang symbol. In 1898, these were superseded by similar designs produced by engraving in London, and inscribed CHINESE IMPERIAL POST on a Chinese supplied watermarked paper of varying thickness. The watermark can be difficult to detect on the thicker paper. New printings of the stamp, beginning in 1899 were on unwatermarked paper, but there are no recorded usages of this variety until 1901. These stamps continued in use until the end of the empire. During that time some colours were changed to comply with Universal Postal Union regulations, and three new values were added.Ma Ren Chuen, Ma's Illustrated Catalogue of the Stamps of China, Volume I - Empire, Edited by Lee H. Hill, Jr., Tampa, Hill-Donnelly, 1995, pp. 138 ff. The first commemorative stamps of China were issued in 1909 to mark the 1st year of the reign of the Xuantong Emperor. The set of three (2c, 3c, 7c), all depicted the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.

An additional set of overprints was produced by Waterlow and Sons in London, and postmasters throughout the country made their own unofficial overprints using the same characters. The first new designs of the Republic were two commemorative sets of 12 each, the first set depicting Sun Yat-sen and second Yuan Shikai, both issued on 14 December 1912. The definitives of the \\"Junk issue\\" went on sale 5 May 1913, and continued in use into the 1930s. The low values featured a junk, while values from 15c to 50c showed a farmer reaping rice, while the dollar values depicted the three-part gateway to the Hall of Classics in Beijing. The series was first printed in London, then in Beijing from 1915; they can be distinguished by close examination. The designs were re-engraved in 1923, and a number of design features were changed; for instance, the whitecaps in the water underneath the junk were removed, and the water darkened. China produced five new commemorative issues, of four stamps each, during the 1920s. The first, issued on 1921-10-10 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Chinese Post Office featured then president Xu Shichang in the centre, flanked by Premier Jing Yongbeng and Minister of Communication Ye Gongzuo. On 1923-10-17 a set showing the Temple of Heaven commemorated the new constitution. On 1928-03-01 a set depicting Marshal of the Army and Navy Zhang Zuolin marked his assumption of that role.

Finally on 1929-05-30, two days before the event, four stamps showing Sun Yat Sen's mausoleum were issued to commemorate his state funeral.Ma Ren Chuen, Ma's Illustrated Catalogue of the Stamps of China Revised edition, Tampa, Hill-Donnelly, 1998, pp. 75-79 New definitives in 1931 depicted Sun Yat-sen. These stamps, along with the Martyrs issue of 1932 honoring six martyrs of the Kuomintang, would see much overprinting in the next several years. =Japanese occupation and wartime= During the occupation of several Chinese regions by the Japanese (1937‚Äì1945), Chinese stamps were originally in use in the occupied territories. Since 1941, Chinese stamps were overprinted separately for Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, North China, Shanghai and Nanjing. And for some areas, locally designed stamps were issued. =Communist posts= Communist authorities issued stamps in areas over which they had control from 1930 onwards. These were usually in more remote areas, often on the mountainous borders of two provinces - hence they are often referred to as 'Border Areas'. For example, the earliest communist issues (the so-called 'Red Posts') were in mountainous areas of Jiangxi, the Hunan - Hubei border area and West Fujian, bordering Jiangxi. =Post‚ÄìWorld War II= The end of the conflict brought little respite to the Nationalist government, which continued to struggle with Communist forces. But they were able to issue commemoratives to remember President Lin Sen, who had died in 1943, to mark the October inauguration of Chiang, and to celebrate the Allied victory. Inflation had been creating a need for ever-higher values throughout 1945, but in 1946 things went out of control; stocks of stamps, some dating back to 1931, were surcharged with values up to $2000, and a new design (still featuring a portrait of Sun Yat-sen) went up to $5000. 1947 saw a number of commemorative issues, and further inflation, a Sun Yat-sen with plum blossoms issue reaching $50,000 that year, then surpassed in 1948 with reissues topping out with a $5,000,000 stamp. In 1948, a gold yuan standard was adopted, and an assortment of existing stamps were surcharged with values from 1/2c and up. This was a short-lived stopgap, and by early 1949 it became necessary to stamps and overprints with a range of values, again going up to $5,000,000. On 1 May 1949, the government took a desperate step, which was to print undenominated stamps, sold at the daily rate of the yuan. They then adopted a silver yuan standard, and overprinted still more stamps as well as reissuing the Sun Yat-sen design valued in 1-500 cents. By August, the deteriorating political situation had caught up with the postal system, and the Nationalists' last issues on the mainland were two of a planned series of pictorial designs denominated in silver yuan. Following the loss of mainland China, stamps are restricted to Taiwan and surrounding islands. Since 2008, stamps are inscribed \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\". Image:Stamp China 1945 2 inauguration.jpgAlthough not the first appearance of Chiang Kai-shek on a stamp, this October 1945 commemoration of his inauguration includes a broader array of nationalistic symbols. Image:Stamp China 1946 2000 on 5 ovpt.jpgSevere inflation required a steady stream of overprints; this $2000 value is from 1946. Image:Stamp China 1949 4c on 100 silver ovpt.jpgThis silver yuan overprint on a revenue stamp was used for only a few months in mid-1949. File:Defence of kinmen and Matsu 1.40 Stamp.JPGA 1959 stamp of the island of Taiwan.  Manchukuo  Japan created a puppet state called Manchukuo out of north-east China in 1932. Although the state ceased to exist after the Second World War, it managed during its lifetime to create many interesting cultural chimeras, including stamps. The designs of Manchukuo stamps show the influence of both countries. In fact, the 1944 Friendship Set was printed in both Chinese and Japanese. People's Republic of China The postal system of the People's Republic of China was established as the General Postal Administration in Beijing in 1949, growing out of the posts that had been operating for several years in the liberated areas. Development was slow; by 1949 there was only 1 post office for every 370 square kilometers. Several of the liberated areas continued to operate their own postal systems; most were ordered to stop selling regional stamp issues by June 30, 1950, while the Northeast Liberation Area and the Port Arthur and Dairen Post and Telegraph Administration continued to use their own stamps (due to the different currencies) until the end of 1950. = Postage stamps = The unified administration issued its first postage stamps on October 8, 1949, consisting of a set of four depicting a lantern and the Gate of Heavenly Peace, commemorating the 1st session of the Chinese People's Consultative Political Conference. This issue also inaugurated the innovative practice of numbering each type of stamp issued, usually in the lower left corner. For instance, the $800 value in the Dove of Peace issue of 1950 is numbered \\"5.3-2\\", indicating that it is the second stamp of three in the fifth stamp issue of China. The practice is only followed for commemorative and special stamps, regular definitive stamps having no special markings. The first definitive series came in February 1950, and featured the Gate of Heavenly Peace against a background of clouds. The nine values ranged from $200 to $10,000. The design was modified several times over the next year, and again in 1954, resulting in what philatelists call the \\"second\\" through \\"sixth\\" issues, each varying in minor ways, such as the layout of the clouds. The postal system found it necessary to surcharge stamps of the previous government, with issues in March and August 1950, and May 1951. In addition, leftover stamps of the Northeastern Provinces were pressed into service in July 1950, and those of East China in December 1950. In the meantime, various commemoratives marked conferences and other events of the young republic. In June 1952 a set of forty stamps depicting physical exercises was issued in conjunction with a radio program; ten exercises were illustrated, each with a block of four, where each stamp shows a different position of arms and legs for the exercise. =Cultural Revolution= Yang W82 unissued stamp \\"Great Victory of Cultural Revolution\\" showing Chairman Mao and Lin Biao at a victory celebration in the countryside Reduced stamp sales and withdrawals from issue of several stamps during the Cultural Revolution resulted in a few stamps that are quite scarce, especially used. The typical pattern resulting in rarity was unauthorized sales before the official date of issue by isolated post offices of stamps which were then withdrawn from issue before the official date of issue. One rarity, an unissued 8f stamp from 1967 commemorating the 40th Anniversary of Establishment of Jing Gangshan Revolutionary Base, popularly known as \\"Big Blue Sky\\", which pictured Chairman Mao and Lin Biao on the podium overlooking Tienanmen Square exists only as scraps salvaged from the destruction process. Only scraps from one stamp in the withdrawn set are known to exist. During the Cultural Revolution era, between the year of 1967 and 1971, there were 19 sets total 80 stamps issued by the China Postal Service, with its distinct design and strong political overtone, these stamps became highly collectable after the end of Cultural Revolution. = Postal service = The postal service was established rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. By 1952 the principal postal networks centered on the capital, Beijing, and links to all large cities had been established. Great progress was made in improving the postal service under the First Five-Year Plan. Postal service was also developed in the rural areas. Besides extending rural postal routes, the problem of delivering mail to places below the county level was solved by enlisting the aid of the population. From 1954 onward a system of mail delivery by rural postal workers was tried in agricultural cooperatives, and in 1956 this system was extended throughout the country. By 1959 the national postal network was complete. Postal service was administered by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (now the Ministry of Information Industry), which was established in 1949 and reestablished in 1973 after a two-year period during which the postal and telecommunications functions had been separated and the ministry downgraded to a subministerial level. In 1984 China had 53,000 post and telecommunications offices and 5 million kilometers of postal routes, including 240,000 kilometers of railroad postal routes, 624,000 kilometers of highway postal routes, and 230,000 kilometers of airmail routes. By 1985 post offices were handling 4.7 billion first-class letters and 25 billion newspapers and periodicals. In 1987, after a six-year hiatus, six-digit postal codes were ordered to be put into use. For many years, China was not a member of the Universal Postal Union, and while using Arabic numerals for the denominations, did not include the country's name in Latin letters as required of UPU nations. The addition of \\"CHINA\\" to stamps' inscriptions began in 1992. Western collectors typically differentiate earlier stamps both by the serial numbers in the lower corner, and by the first character of the country name ‰∏≠, the \\"square box with a vertical bar\\" being visually distinct from the inscription used by any other Asian country.

He is also considered \\"last of the great castrati\\" and had a reputation of being something of a diva, with some singers refusing to appear with him.  Biography  Born in Pausula (near Macerata), Italy, a local doctor castrated him at the age of eight as treatment for a cough and high fever. Velluti's father, who had planned on a military career for his son, enrolled him in musical training. He became close friends with Luigi Cardinal Chiaramonte, the man who would become Pope Pius VII, after singing a cantata sometime in his teenage years. In 1800, he made his debut at Forl√¨. The last great castrato roles were composed specifically for him: Arsace in Rossini's Aureliano in Palmira (1813) and Armando in Meyerbeer's Il crociato in Egitto (1824). He made his London debut in 1825 in Il crociato in Egitto. The crowds reacted poorly to his initial performances as he was the first castrato to appear in London in 25 years, but he drew crowds until the end of his career. In 1826 he took over management of The King's Theatre in London and appeared there in Aureliano in Palmira and Morlacchi's Tebaldo ed Isolina. However, his career as a theatre manager ended following financial quarrels over extra pay for the chorus. He returned to London in 1829, but appeared only in concerts. Upon his retirement from the stage, he became an agriculturist and died in 1861.

Watchmaking was introduced there between 1730 and 1740 by David Vaucher, probably a pupil of the legendary Daniel JeanRichard. The number of watchmakers in the Val-de-Travers grew very rapidly in the first half of the 19th century. The lace making that had provided work for a good third of the people living in the valley had been replaced by the much lower cost production on Jacquard machines in France and Flanders. Four more sons and a daughter were born in the following years. After completing his apprenticeship as a watchmaker, Edouard Bovet and two of his brothers moved to London, then the center of watch assembly and the watch trade in 1814.

Soon every first class watch in China with a high practical value and elegant exterior was simply called \\"Bovet\\" (pronounced \\"Boway\\" or read backwards \\"Tevob\\"). Pearl ornamentation and enamel miniature painting carried out in Geneva on Bovet watches ensured first class aesthetics at prices that, in contrast to the exaggerated luxury watches of the time, were affordable, at least for the upper class. For years a Bovet watch was considered an asset in China and was accepted in payment everywhere. The movement was frequently finely engraved and chased and could be observed through a glass cover on the back. The central second hand that jumped every second, like modern quartz watches, was a Bovet specialty. Bovet adapted its production to the Chinese tradition of making gifts of valuable objects (statues, vases, horses even concubines) in pairs. So he could often sell two identical watches at the same time: if one failed, there was a replacement at hand. But Bovet‚Äôs enamel painters found it very difficult to paint two identical but mirror-image miniatures. =Return to Fleurier= Edouard Bovet returned to Fleurier in 1830 as a made man, accompanied by his four-year-old half-Chinese son Edouard- Georges. At that time it was customary for the European merchants in China to take a \\"temporary\\" wife for the duration of their stay. If children were born of this liaison, the father had to accept full responsibility. As a fervent republican, Bovet exposed himself in the abortive Neuch√¢tel revolution against Prussian rule in 1831. The house that his brothers had built for him in Fleurier according to his written instructions from China had to remain empty for the time being. Bovet had to move to Besan√ßon where he continued watchmaking with the help of other exiled watchmakers. Legacy Edouard Bovet‚Äôs brothers and nephews - all of them shareholders in the company - made sure that the cornerstones of the Bovet empire in Fleurier, London and Canton continued to flourish. Once the political situation was back to normal, in 1840, the firm was reregistered as Bovet Fr√®res et Cie.; the share capital amounted to one million francs. Edouard Bovet died in 1849; he lived long enough to witness the triumph of the republic and the withdrawal of the Prussians in the previous year. The succession was settled and the production for China continued; in 1855 Bovet was awarded a gold medal at the world exhibition in Paris for an absolutely identical pair of watches ordered by the emperor of China. Two generations later the Bovets were running a flourishing Swiss-Chinese commercial enterprise and were no longer interested in watchmaking. The name was sold several times and relaunched in 1994. The current Bovet watches are modeled on their luxury precursors from the 19th century and look like pocket watches for the wrist.

The skirmishes, which involved limited combat, occurred in May 1776 at and around the Cedars, west of Montreal, British North America. Continental Army units were opposed by a small force of British troops leading a larger force of Indians (primarily Iroquois) and militia. Brigadier General Benedict Arnold, commanding the American military garrison at Montreal, had placed a detachment of his troops at the Cedars in April 1776, after hearing of rumors of British and Indian military preparations to the west of Montreal. The garrison surrendered on May 19 after a confrontation with a combined force of British and Indian troops led by Captain George Forster. American reinforcements on their way to the Cedars were also captured after a brief skirmish on May 20. All of the captives were eventually released after negotiations between Forster and Arnold, who was bringing a sizable force into the area. The terms of the agreement required the Americans to release an equal number of British prisoners, but the deal was repudiated by Congress, and no British prisoners were freed. Colonel Timothy Bedel and Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield, leaders of the American force at the Cedars, were court-martialed and cashiered from the Continental Army for their roles in the affair. After distinguishing himself as a volunteer, Bedel was given a new commission in 1777. News of the affair included greatly inflated reports of casualties, and often included graphic but false accounts of atrocities committed by the Iroquois, who made up the majority of the British forces. Background The Cedars is on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, about from the center of modern Montreal, to the southwest of the western tip of the island of Montreal, from which it is separated by the Ottawa River. The nearby rapids in the Saint Lawrence required portage, making the Cedars a strategic landing point for anyone navigating the river to or from Montreal.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 365 Crossing of the Ottawa River was made between Fort Anne and Quinze-Ch√™nes,Quinze-Ch√™nes (\\"Fifteen oaks\\" in English) was the name of the place at the time. The place was later also known as Quinze Chiens (\\"fifteen dogs\\") or Vaudreuil. now Vaudreuil.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 372 =Montreal= In September 1775, early in the American Revolutionary War, a Continental Army under the direction first of Major General Philip Schuyler, and later of Brigadier General Richard Montgomery, invaded the British Province of Quebec. Montreal was taken without a fight on November 13, following the Siege of Fort St. Jean. Montgomery left a garrison of troops under the command of Major General David Wooster in control of Montreal before leading the rest of the army to Quebec City. The occupation of Montreal was poorly managed, and relations between the Americans and the population, including those supportive of the Americans, deteriorated for a variety of reasons. One major factor that contributed to the poor relations was the American interdiction of trade with the Indian populations on the upper St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, since the trade goods might be used to support British garrisons in those areas. The fur trade was economically important to the city, and its interruption affected both supporters and opponents of the American cause.These events are recounted in great detail in e.g. Smith (1907), Vol 1, Lanctot (1967), and Stanley (1973). alt=A black and white mezzotint print of a three-quarter length portrait. Wooster is standing, facing left, wearing a military uniform, holding a pike in right hand, with his left hand resting on a cannon. Following the American losses at the battle of Quebec at the end of 1775, Wooster eventually led reinforcements to Quebec. He arrived early in April 1776, and the military administration of Montreal passed temporarily to Colonel Moses Hazen before going to Brigadier General Benedict Arnold, who had been in command at Quebec. The American forces occupying the city numbered about 500, with additional forces at posts outside the city. Wooster had reported to General Schuyler as early as March 5 of rumored scheming between British troops and Indians to the west of the city.Wooster (1885), pp. 122‚Äì123 In response to these alarming reports, as well as the unauthorized departures of two fur traders and Claude de Lorimier, a British Indian agent from Montreal, Hazen had sent 400 troops commanded by Colonel Timothy Bedel of Bedel's Regiment to occupy a strategic position at the Cedars in early April.Lanctot (1967), p. 141, establishes the date, but incorrectly assumes Arnold issued the order. Arnold was still at Quebec City (as was Wooster) on April 2. Arnold confirmed the order when he arrived in Montreal later in April (Smith Vol 2, p. 365). Lieutenant Isaac Butterfield led an advance force that arrived at the Cedars on April 26 and began construction of a wooden stockade fort, fortifying it with two 4-pound cannons. Bedel and the rest of the detachment arrived on May 6.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 366 =British call to arms= The Indian agent Lorimier traveled west to Oswegatchie, where a company of the 8th Regiment of Foot under the command of George Forster had occupied Fort de La Pr√©sentation.Leighton (2000) Lorimier proposed recruiting a force of Indians to launch an attack on Continental forces at Montreal from the west. When Forster agreed, Lorimier went to Saint Regis, where he recruited 100 Mohawk men from Akwesasne. Word of these activities led the American rebels to fortify the Cedars.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 363 At Fort Niagara in early May the Loyalist captain, John Butler, held a conference with several hundred tribesmen, primarily from the Six Nations of the Iroquois, in which his goal was to break pledges of neutrality some of them had made in 1775. Butler, an experienced Indian agent, plied the natives with liquor and tales of combat; he convinced more than 50 Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga warriors to join the British cause, as well as some warriors from further west.Glatthaar (2007), pp. 112‚Äì113 Historians are uncertain whether any of these recruits participated in the action at the Cedars, but it appears unlikely. Stanley (1973) is of the opinion that Indian participation was limited to those recruited by Lorimier, who went as far as Gananoque to recruit.Stanley (1973), p. 119 Lanctot (1967) and Smith do not identify any specific tribes participating in the action.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 367Early histories of this action‚Äîe.g. Stone (1838) (p. 153) and Beers (1883) (p. 93)‚Äîclaim that Joseph Brant was among the Indian leaders participating in this action. This assertion is largely based on the behavior of one of the warriors and Arnold's memoirs; Smith (Vol 2, p. 596) documents that Brant went to England in November 1775, and did not return to New York until June 1776. Barbara Graymont's recent biography of Brant (Graymont (2000)) does not mention the event at all. James Stanley Goddard, one of the fur traders who left with Lorimier, traveled further west in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to raise an Indian force to oppose the Americans occupying Quebec. He reached Fort Michilimackinac in June, where the British commander, Captain Arent DePeyster, sent him recruiting among the Menominee and Winnebago tribes near Green Bay. DePeyster also sent out Joseph Ainsse, a local Indian interpreter, to recruit from tribes closer to the fort. None of the Indians recruited by these men reached Montreal until well after the Americans had left the city.Barnett (2003), p. 27 Prelude Once forces began assembling at Oswegatchie, Lorimier made arrangements with a sympathetic priest near the Cedars for the provisioning of supplies for the troops. With the assistance of some men of the 8th Foot, he strategically hid several shallow-draft boats, known as bateaux, near a point where the Saint Lawrence River could be crossed.Kingsford (1893), pp. 63‚Äì64 Forster left Oswegatchie on May 12 with about 40 regular troops, 10 British and French-speaking Canadien militia, and 160 Iroquois. On May 14, they picked up 44 more Iroquois at Saint Francis, and camped at the western end of Saint Francis Lake on May 16.Kingsford (1893), p. 46 On May 17, Forster received scouting reports about the troop strength at the Cedars. The Indians were concerned about the number of troops, but news that the Americans were in retreat from Quebec emboldened them to act. On May 15, Bedel left the Cedars, leaving Butterfield in charge of the fort. Bedel later claimed that the reason for his departure was to meet with the friendly Caughnawaga Indians. In his court martial, the judges concluded this claim was suspect.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 593 He returned to Montreal and reported that a force of 150 British troops of the 8th Foot and about 500 Iroquois commanded by Forster was approaching. On this news, Colonel John Paterson sent Major Henry Sherburne with 140 men from his regiment toward the Cedars.Jones (1882), p. 55 Arnold, who was meeting with the retreating Continental Army command at Sorel, returned to Montreal when the news reached him and set about organizing a larger relief force.Martin (1997), p. 210 Battle =The Cedars= alt=Movements are explained in the article text. Forster's force landed near the American-occupied fort on May 18, and sent in a demand for surrender. Butterfield countered with a request to withdraw under arms, which Forster refused. The parties exchanged fire. During the course of the exchange, Forster received word that Sherburne had crossed the Ottawa River from the island of Montreal to Quinze-Ch√™nes, but, believing the Cedars to have fallen already, had retreated back across the river. This news caused the besiegers to redouble their efforts the next day. Additional help arrived for the British in the form of about 40 Canadiens under Jean-Baptiste Testard de Montigny; Forster sent them to harass Sherburne. Word then came to Forster that Sherburne had resumed his advance; Butterfield, unaware of this, surrendered the fort.Kingsford (1893), pp. 47‚Äì48Angus (1955), p. 195 The terms of capitulation included a guarantee of the personal safety of the captured men. The Iroquois plundered the fort's stores, and denied some of the captives small pouches of sometimes valuable personal items. =Quinze-Ch√™nes= Sherburne reached Fort Anne, across the Ottawa River from Quinze-Ch√™nes, on May 17. A scout he sent across the river the next day was captured by Lorimier. The scout was allowed to notify Sherburne of his capture; in his message he included a claim that 500 Indians had surrounded the fort at the Cedars. Consequently, Sherburne decided to delay crossing the river, and sent word back to Montreal requesting further assistance. Sherburne decided to advance on May 20. Some of his men were apparently suffering from the aftereffects of smallpox, so these were left behind. Sherburne landed about 100 of his men at Quinze-Ch√™nes, about from the Cedars. When word of this crossing reached Forster, he ordered Lorimier to take 100 Indians and stop Sherburne. Lorimier was at first only able to raise 40 warriors, but was joined on the way by another 40. Sherburne, not realizing that Butterfield had already surrendered, marched his troops right at Lorimier's advancing force. They fought for about 40 minutes before Sherburne, believing he was being attacked by a much larger force, surrendered.Kingsford (1893), pp. 49‚Äì50 The Iroquois claimed these captives as war spoils, since they were not part of the fort's garrison, and prepared to kill some of them in retaliation for their own losses. Only the intervention of Forster, who paid a ransom, prevented this; it did not prevent the Iroquois from stripping the prisoners of all but their clothes.Kingsford (1893), p. 51 =Arnold's relief= alt=A head and shoulders profile engraving of Arnold. He is facing left, wearing a uniform with two stars on the shoulder epaulet. His hair is tied back. Following his successes, Forster moved his forces, including all of the prisoners, down to Quinze-Ch√™nes, where more Loyalist militia had assembled. Leaving some of the prisoners there, he advanced on May 23 to Fort Senneville, a fortified works on the southwest tip of Montreal island that was owned by Montigny. In the meantime, Arnold gathered most of the few remaining forces in Montreal, and sent requests to the outposts around the city for additional troops. By May 24, he was entrenched at Lachine, south of the city, and his force had reached 450 men. Forster began to advance on Lachine, but decided to retreat back to Quinze-Ch√™nes when his scouts notified him of Arnold's position. He also received intelligence from Montreal that Arnold's force was going to be massively reinforced‚Äîthe reported number of reinforcements was 1,500 to 2,000 men, more than Arnold had available in the area.Martin (1997), p. 211Kingsford (1893), p. 52 Once his scouts reported Forster's retreat, Arnold gave chase. He reached Fort Senneville (which he burned) on May 26, just as Forster's men were landing on the far shore at Quinze-Ch√™nes.Kingsford (1893), p. 54 Arnold decided to send a group of Caughnawagas, who were friendly to the Americans, with a demand that Forster release his prisoners and a threat that he would destroy area Indian villages if any of the prisoners were harmed. Forster countered that he would permit his Indians to kill the prisoners if Arnold attacked. Arnold attempted to cross the Ottawa River with some of his men in bateaux, but Forster used the four-pounders captured at the Cedars to drive them back.Martin (1997), p. 212 rightthumbupright=1.0Movements after the battle: A,B: British move to Fort Senneville, May 20‚Äì23 C: British retreat, May 24‚Äì25 D,E: American advance to Ottawa River crossing, May 26 Arnold called a war council so the Americans could consider their options. He wanted to mount a surprise attack the next morning; Hazen, who had acquired significant experience fighting Indians in the French and Indian War, argued against the idea. The disagreement between the two men was severe enough that it nearly provoked Arnold to file charges of insubordination against Hazen. The council decided not to act, voting Arnold's proposed attack down.Kingsford (1893), p. 55 Early in the morning of May 27, a boat crossed the river carrying Sherburne and Forster's deputy, Lieutenant Parke. Forster, whose forces were somewhat reduced as some of the Indians had returned to their homes, had negotiated a prisoner exchange with Sherburne and Butterfield. After further negotiations, both Arnold and Forster agreed to terms. The American prisoners were returned to Arnold at Fort Anne on May 30, after being delayed for two days by high winds on the river.Kingsford (1893), p. 56Martin (1997), p. 214 Aftermath The Americans never held up their side of the prisoner exchange. Formally repudiating the agreement over the protests of George Washington, Congress accused Forster of mistreating American prisoners by turning them over to the Indians. In a breach of etiquette, the letter containing the repudiation was delivered to Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, instead of the British commander-in-chief and governor of the province, Guy Carleton. The Congressional action may have been tainted by overly lurid accounts of the action‚ÄîCharles Carroll, part of a Congressional delegation that was in Montreal at the time, reported that \\"a hundred or more [American troops] were barbarously murdered by savages.\\"Kingsford (1893), p. 60 Arnold's report of the incident included otherwise unsubstantiated allegations that two prisoners were killed by Forster's Indians. Some histories of the action (for example, the 1882 history by Jones) include accounts of significant atrocities committed by the Indians, but little supporting evidence has been found. The Congressional repudiation complicated an attempted prisoner exchange in 1781 involving Burgoyne and Henry Laurens, a congressman from South Carolina whom the British were holding in the Tower of London; Laurens was eventually freed in exchange for a promise to help negotiate Lord Cornwallis's release.Cobbett (1814), pp. 860‚Äì862Brant (2007), pp. 182‚Äì185 Arnold initially blamed Bedel for the defeat. He removed both Bedel and Butterfield from command and sent them to Sorel for court-martial. Due to the army's retreat, the two men were not tried until August 1, 1776, at Fort Ticonderoga. Both were convicted and cashiered from the army.Jones (1882), pp. 56‚Äì57 Bedel continued to volunteer his services, and following Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga in October 1777, he was given a new commission by Congress.Smith (1907), Vol 2, p. 471Metcalf (1915), p. 499 The site of some of the skirmishes was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1928.

Fight history =Background= Barrera had been the WBO super bantamweight champion in the mid 1990s. Morales, from his part, was undefeated and he had won the WBC super bantamweight title, knocking out Daniel Zaragoza (being the first person to do so) in eleven rounds in 1997. Promoters soon began arrangements for a bout between the WBC and WBO super bantamweight title holders. =First bout= The first bout took place on February 19, 2000, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, in Las Vegas and was televised on HBO Boxing. Morales was declared winner by split decision, with scores of 115-112, 114-113 and 113-114 and captured the WBO Super Bantamweight title. Many believed that Barrera deserved the decision. This bout was named as Ring Magazine's Fight of the Year for 2000, before being named as the best Fight of all time in the same year. =Second bout= The second bout took place on June 22, 2002, in MGM Grand Las Vegas, Las Vegas. After the impact their first fight had on many of those that saw it, their second fight was made a Pay Per View event. This is often described as the most tactical fight of the trilogy. Nevertheless, there were plenty of punches, but with Barrera fighting a more technical approach, Morales opted to use heavier punches, dropping Barrera to the canvas in the 7th with a blow to the abdomen, which was subsequently ruled a trip by referee Jay Nady. Barrera was nonetheless declared the winner by unanimous decision, with scores of 116-112 and 115-113 and captured the WBC Featherweight title. Many believed that Morales deserved the decision. =Third bout= The third bout of the trilogy was fought at the Super Featherweight division. Morales had gone on to win the WBC title in that division after defeating Jes√∫s Ch√°vez and Barrera had lost recognition as world boxing champion after being defeated by Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, so he moved up to the Super Featherweight division. The fight took place on November 27, 2004 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Barrera was declared the winner and new WBC Super Featherweight champion by majority decision, with scores of 115-113, 115-114, and 114-114.

The distance from Swedish mainland to Finnish mainland is around while the distance between the outmost islands is only . The water depth in the Kvarken region is only around . The region also has an unusual rate of land rising at about a year. On the Finnish side of Kvarken, there is a large archipelago, the Kvarken Archipelago, which includes the large islands Replot, Bj√∂rk√∂ and many smaller islands. Most of it is belongs to the municipality of Korsholm. Most of the small islands are inhabited. The archipelago is smaller on the Swedish side of the region, and the islands have much steeper shores. The Kvarken region was historically important also, because mail was delivered across Kvarken when the sea was completely frozen from the Swedish to the Finnish coast. This mail route was used frequently during the period of Swedish rule. In the group of islands in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of the Kvarken region, in Swedish called Vals√∂rarna - Finnish Valassaaret, is a lighthouse designed by who worked for Gustave Eiffel's engineering bureau. The structural similarity between the lighthouse (built in 1885) and the Eiffel tower (built in 1889) is quite obvious. The lighthouse is now automated as are most lighthouses in Finland. Several attempts to cross the strait swimming have been made but cold water and currents have usually been insurmountable obstacles. The first successful attempt was carried out by Lennart Flygare, Pavio Grzelewski and Tore Klingberg, who on the 24:th of July 2018 swam from Valassaaret (Vals√∂rarna) on the Finnish side to Holm√∂gadd in Sweden. It took them 12 hours 2 minutes to cross the strait. World Heritage Site In 2006, parts of the Kvarken Archipelago were added as an extension to the World Heritage Site of the High Coast (located on the western shore of the Gulf of Bothnia) in Sweden, because it is ‚Äúcontinuously rising from the sea in a process of rapid glacio-isostatic uplift, whereby the land, previously weighed down under the weight of a glacier, lifts at rates that are among the highest in the world. As a consequence of the advancing shoreline, islands appear and unite, peninsulas expand, lakes evolve from bays and develop into marshes and peat fens. This property is essentially a ‚Äòtype area‚Äô for research on isostasy; the phenomenon having been first recognized and studied here.‚Äùhttps://whc.unesco.org/en/list/898 Most Finnish parts of the High Coast/Kvarken Archipelago World Heritage Site are situated in the Korsholm municipality. Bridge There have been proposals for a bridge across the strait, at a cost of about 1.5 to 2 billion euros. There are islands in the strait, and the sum of the lengths of the probably three bridge parts would be about . The Swedish minister of finance has said it is an interesting idea, but the idea is still decades from being brought to fruition. There is a debate in the coastal cities on both sides, like Ume√• and Vaasa. The official view from the Swedish and Finnish governments is that it is much too expensive, also put in regard that the cities are very small by European standards, as compared to Copenhagen and Malm√∂ between the Oresund fixed link. The natural values in the area also makes a bridge dubious.

His meticulous and almost photo-real style was popular, but courted controversy among art critics and other artists. Laktionov was born in Rostov-on-Don and studied in the Leningrad Academy of Arts from 1926‚Äì1929 and later as a postgraduate from 1938-1944. Laktionov was a pupil of the artist Isaak Brodskii and was influenced by his technical and realistic approach, which followed the traditions of the Old Masters. A Letter From the Front on a USSR postage stamp of 1973. Laktionov‚Äôs breakthrough work was A Letter From the Front (1947), which captured the prevailing mood among the people of the Soviet Union following the German-Soviet War. It is a highly optimistic work, bathed in a warm glow, which became a motif of Laktionov‚Äôs later works and Socialist Realism in general. Laktionov became most famous for his genre paintings such as Into a New Flat (1952) and Old Age Provided For (1958‚Äì60). These painstakingly realistic works paint an overwhelmingly positive picture of Soviet society. Nonetheless, these paintings proved popular among the general public, despite their mixed critical reception. This criticism was leveled mainly at Laktionov‚Äôs trademark attention to detail that, they claimed, eschews artistic expression in favor of naturalism. In spite of this, Laktionov found many supporters in the state cultural bureaucracy, who approved of his nationalistic and optimistic subject matter. This ensured that Laktionov was able to lead a highly successful career and mix in the highest echelons of Soviet society. Throughout his later years he was commissioned to paint numerous portraits of leading Soviet actors, surgeons, soldiers, politicians and cosmonauts, including a portrait of Joseph Stalin.

The leaders of such a system are usually known as corulers.. Historically, diarchy particularly referred to the system of shared rule in British India established by the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935, which devolved some powers to local councils, which had included native Indian representation under the Indian Councils Act 1892. 'Duumvirate' principally referred to the offices of the various duumviri established by the Roman Republic. Both, along with less common synonyms such as biarchy. and tandemocracy, are now used more generally to refer to any system of joint rule or office. A monarchy temporarily controlled by two or more people is, however, usually distinguished as a coregency. Corule is one of the oldest forms of government. Historical examples include the Pandyan dynasty of Tamilakam, Sparta's joint kingdom, the Roman Republic's consuls, Carthage's Judges, and several ancient Polynesian societies. Systems of inheritance that often led to corule in Germanic and Dacian monarchies may be included as well, as may the dual occupants of the ranks of the Inca Empire. Modern examples of diarchies are Andorra, whose princes are the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia; and San Marino, whose republic is led by two Captains Regent. Formal use = Current diarchies =  Andorra  Andorra is a parliamentary co-principality. Its princes are (ex officio) the French president and the bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain. Since 1962, the French president has been elected by universal suffrage within France. The bishop of the diocese of Urgell is appointed by the Roman Catholic pope.  Bhutan  The 2008 Constitution affirms Bhutan's commitment to a traditional dual government sharing power between the Druk Gyalpo (\\"King\\") and the Buddhist religious authorities led by the Je Khenpo. In practice, however, the religious leaders function more as advisors to the kings than as corulers. Northern Ireland Under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement intended to end conflict in Northern Ireland, the First Minister and deputy First Minister serve as joint heads of the area's executive. Both positions exercise identical executive powers; however they are not heads of state.  San Marino  The captains regent () of San Marino are elected every six months by the Marinese parliament, the Grand and General Council. They serve as heads of state and government and are normally chosen from opposing parties.  Israel  After the 2019-2020 political crisis, the Basic Law of Israel‚Äôs government underwent a major change. A system of two prime ministers, that can be appointed at the same time by the Knesset, was established. According to the new method, there is an ‚Äúalternate prime minister‚Äù in addition to the main and declared one. After half of the government's term, the two prime ministers change positions and status. However, during the term, the government‚Äôs roles and duties are divided between the two prime ministers and each one of them is entitled to appoint and remove ministers without the other‚Äôs interference. =Historical diarchies= Sparta The office of king in ancient Sparta was divided between two kings from separate dynasties, each holding a veto over the other's actions. Roman Republic Following the overthrow of the Roman monarchy, the Romans established an oligarchic Roman Republic which divided supreme executive power () between two consuls, both elected each year and each holding a veto over the other's actions. The historical duumviri were not rulers but magistrates, performing various judicial, religious, or public functions. Hungary The Hungarians originally possessed a system of dual kingship, with religious authority vested in the kende and military authority vested in the war-chief ('). It is believed that when the kende Kursz√°n was killed a little after the arrival of the Hungarians in Pannonia, his role was usurped by the war-chief √Årp√°d, establishing the Hungarian monarchy. It is not known with certainty whether √Årp√°d was originally the kende or the gyula. Medieval Europe A par√©age was a feudal treaty recognizing the \\"equal footing\\" () of two sovereigns over a territory. The most famous such arrangement was the 1278 treaty that established modern Andorra. Others include Maastricht, which was shared by the Duke of Brabant and the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. After the establishment of the Dutch Republic, it became a condominium of Li√®ge and the United Provinces, which administered it through the States General of the Netherlands until 1794. Japan During Japan's shogunate, the emperor was notionally a supreme spiritual and temporal lord who delegated authority for joint rule to the sh≈çgun. In practice, the sh≈çguns power was so complete that they are usually considered de facto monarchs rather than viceroys or corulers. Tibet Between 1642 and 1751, political power in Tibet was shared between the 5th, 6th, and 7th Dalai Lamas who headed the realm's Buddhist state religion and various secular rulers known as desis. The growing power of the desis caused the 7th Dalai Lama to abolish the post and replace it with a council known as the Kashag, permitting him to consolidate his authority over the realm. A similar system arose in Bhutan, with the Wangchuck governor (penlop) of Trongsa becoming the Druk Desi and Druk Gyalpo in 1907. In contrast to Tibet, the dynasty eventually consolidated its power and now rules as the kings of Bhutan.  Canada  The colonial Province of Canada was usually governed by two joint premiers from 1841 to 1867. Usually, one was chosen from the English-speaking Canada West and the other one from the French-speaking Canada East. Russia Between the February Revolution in March 1917 and the October Revolution in November, political power in Russia was divided between the Russian Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet, a condition described by Vladimir Lenin as \\"Dual Power\\". He elaborated the situation into a dual-power doctrine, whereby Communists collaborated with and then supplanted existing bourgeois forms of government. India Named as the India Secretary for the Lloyd George ministry, Edwin Samuel Montagu made the \\"Grand Declaration\\" on 20 August 1917 that British policy would henceforth be \\"increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions\\". Montagu and Viscount Chelmsford, the Governor-General of India, then made an extensive tour of the subcontinent in 1917 and 1918. The Montague‚ÄìChelmsford Report's recommendations formed the basis for the Government of India Act 1919 that established \\"diarchy\\" in British India. Under that act, the executive was to be headed by a governor appointed by the Secretary of State, who could consult the Governor General. The governor was responsible to the Secretary of State for acts of omission and commission. He was to maintain law and order in the province and ensure that the provincial administration worked smoothly. In respect of transferred subjects, he was to be assisted by his ministers whereas reserved subjects were to be administered by the Governor General and his executive council. The members of the Executive Council were to be appointed by Secretary of State and were responsible to him in all matters. There were certain matters that he was to administer at his own discretion, in which he was responsible to the Secretary of State. Each councillor was to remain in office for a period of four years. Their salaries and service conditions were not subject to the vote of provincial legislature. All decisions in the council were to be taken by a majority of votes, the Governor being able to break ties. Samoa During the establishment of the modern state of Samoa in 1962, power was shared between the two chiefs Malietoa Tanumafili II and Tupua Tamasese Mea ªole. Mea ªole died the next year, after which the country functioned as a monarchy until the death of Tanumafili and a republic thereafter. Informal use =Bureaucracy= Shared power arrangements within a modern bureaucracy may also be known as a \\"diarchy\\" or \\"duumvirate\\". Examples include the joint authority of the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of the Department of Defence over the Australian Defence Organisation. =Influential outsiders= The status of monarchs is sometimes impugned by accusations of corule when an advisor, family member, lover, or friend appears to have taken too great a hand in government. L√º Buwei in Chinese history and Fran√ßois Leclerc du Tremblay in France are famous examples of \\"√©minences grises\\" who controlled much of their countries' policies. In British history, George VI's reign was mocked as a \\"split-level matriarchy in pants\\" owing to the supposed influence of his mother, Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth.. =Informally shared power= Owing to Confucian notions of filial piety, Chinese and Japanese emperors were sometimes able to 'retire' but continue to exert great influence over state policy. In Indonesia, Sukarno and his vice president Mohammad Hatta were nicknamed the Duumvirate ('), with Sukarno setting government policy and rallying support and Hatta managing day-to-day administration. More recently, the great influence of Vladimir Putin over his successor Dmitry Medvedev was considered a duumvirate or tandemocracy until Putin's resumption of the office of president established him as the greater figure.. Within electoral politics, governments, coalitions and parties may sometimes have two fairly equal leaders, as with: * The temporary First Whitlam Ministry of 5‚Äì19 December 1972, composed of Gough Whitlam and Lance Barnard, which was nicknamed the \\"duumvirate\\". * Russel Norman and Metiria Turei as joint leaders of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand. =Religious leaders= In addition to actual sharing of political power between religious and military leaders, as occurred in Tibet and Bhutan, the great soft power of a religious leader such as the Pope of the Catholic Church over a devout country can sometimes be described as a form of diarchy or corule. =Traditional leaders= The Kingdom of Eswatini is a diarchy in which the King (Ngwenyama) rules in conjunction with his mother, the Queen Mother (Ndlovukati) in their capacity as traditional rulers. Constitutionally, however, the King is the sole head of state, though it is often argued that the giving of authority wholesale to the royal male in this way is a neo-traditionalistic as opposed to truly traditional custom.  In fiction  * Umbar, in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, was ruled by a duumvirate. * The Omaticaya, the Na'vi clan at the center of the film Avatar, are traditionally led by a pair of married tribal chiefs. One of them, the husband, oversees political and military matters while the other one, the wife, is in charge of spiritual and otherwise ceremonial affairs. * The orbital colony New New York, in the Worlds trilogy by Joe Haldeman, is jointly governed by an elected Policy Coordinator and Engineering Coordinator.

Career Born to a family of sailors, Perr√©e started sailing in 1773 at the age of twelve as a boy on the merchantman Glorieuse, under his father. In the course of the following twenty years, he steadily rose in rank in the merchant navy, took part in a campaign on the fluyt Boulonnaise in the French Royal Navy as an aid-pilot, and earned his commission of Sea captain in 1785.Granier, p.162 = Commerce raiding on Proserpine = In 1793, when France declared war to England on the backdrop of the War of the First Coalition, Perr√©e enlisted in the Navy as an acting Ensign.Enseigne non entretenu (Granier, p.162) In September 1793, he was reported to be commanding a frigate squadron in the Western Mediterranean, fighting the inconclusive Action of 22 October 1793 against Captain Horatio Nelson. Promoted to acting Lieutenant in May 1794,Granier (p.162) states that Perr√©e was confirmed in the rank of Lieutenant in October; however, according to the Fonds Marine, he appears to have held the rank of Captain since September at least. and took command of the frigate Proserpine in April 1794Fonds Marine, p.76 to conduct Commerce raiding operations; in his eight-month campaign, he captured over 63 British merchantmen and a 32-gun Dutch frigate on 21 May.Troude, vol.2, p.330Troude names her as Vigilante in the French Navy, but she does not appear in Roche's Dictionnaire des B√¢timents. On 13 September 1794,Granier (p.162) says 1795 Perr√©e was Captain, and was appointed to command a naval division in the Mediterranean, comprising the frigate Alceste, under Lieutenant Lejoille, and the 18-gun brig Hazard, under Lieutenant Leduc. The division returned to Toulon on 10 October. He set sail for another mission on 15 November, this time on Minerve, in consort with Alceste and the 20-gun corvette Brune, under Ensign Deni√©port. The division cruised in the Mediterranean and sailed for a diplomatic mission to Tunis before returning to Toulon on 29 December. On 4 February 1795, Perr√©e cruised again on Minerve, this time in consort with the frigate S√©rieuse, under Lieutenant Saunier. The two frigates cruised in the Mediterranean together until S√©rieuse detached to ferry funds to Algiers. Minerve returned to Toulon on 24 February, and S√©rieuse, on 20 May.Fonds Marine, p.137 In September 1795, was given command of a four-frigate and two- corvette squadron to prey on British shipping off the Western coast of Africa and raid their settlements; during the campaign, he captured 54 merchantmen. On 26 April 1796, Perr√©e departed with the Mediterranean squadron, commanding the brand-new frigate Diane and ferrying diplomats, supplies and ammunitions to Constantinople until 14 November.Fonds Marine, p.172 In early 1797, Perr√©e took command of the naval division of the Adriatic Sea as a Rear-Admiral. The division comprised the frigate Diane, under Lieutenant Hubert; the corvette Brune, still under Deni√©port, who was promoted to Commander; the gunboat Frimaire, under Ensign Suply; and the brig Jason, under Lieutenant S√©n√©quier.Fonds Marine, p.190 In early 1799, Perr√©e commanded the naval station of the Syrian coasts,Fonds Marine, p.225 part of the Mediterranean squadron,Fonds Marine, p.228 with his flag on the frigate Junon.Fonds Marine, p.229 = Campaign in Egypt and the Action of 18 June 1799 = In the Mediterranean squadron, Perr√©e took command of the 74-gun Mercure, but was replaced by Lieutenant Cambon after the landing of the troops.Granier, p. 164 With the rank of Captain, Perr√©e acted as a Chief of Division during the French expedition to Egypt: General Bonaparte appointed him to the Nile flotilla, where he commanded a squadron of shebeks and other light craft. On 13 July, the flotilla fought against Egyptian fluvial ships and forts while supplying food and ammunition to the French Army, and Perr√©e managed to captured some of these ships and ward off the others.Troude, vol.2, p. 94 Wounded during the prelude of the Battle of Shubra Khit, Per√©e was promoted to Rear-admiral on the insistence of Bonaparte, and received a sabre of honour inscribed \\"Bataille de Chabreis\\" on one side of the blade, and \\"Donn√© par le g√©n√©ral Bonaparte\\" on the other. When the French campaign in the Middle East turned to Syria, Perr√©e took command of a squadron of three frigates and two brigs, survivors of the Battle of the Nile, to ferry supplies and artillery for the Army in spite of the Ottoman and British blockades. The squadron comprised the frigates Junon (Commander PourquierRoche, p.269), Courageuse (Captain TrulletRoche, p. 131) and Alceste (Captain Barr√©), and the brigs Salamine (Lieutenant LandryRoche, p. 420) and Alerte (DemayTroude, vol. 3, p. 163).Fonds Marine, p. 81 Arrived at Jaffa, the frigates unloaded their cargo, and furthermore shared their own ammunition, leaving the frigates with only 15 shots per gun; Junon also landed four of her 18-pounder long guns. The division then established a blockade to complete the Siege of Acre. On 14 May, it was chased by two enemy ships of the line and a frigate, under Sidney Smith,Granier, p. 168 which it quickly eluded. In spite of specific orders to land in Europe only if he could not possibly do otherwise, Perr√©e conferred with his officers and decided that his low supplies made it necessary for him to return to Toulon, by way of Lampedusa, where he would replenish his water.Troude, vol. 3, p. 164 At 60 miles from Toulon, on 18 June 1799, Perr√©e's division met a 30-ship fleet under Lord Keith; a 28-hour chase started and in the ensuing Action of 18 June 1799, all of Perr√©e's ships were captured.Gu√©rin, p.181 Perr√©e was taken prisoner and exchanged almost immediately. Court-martialled from 6 October to 25 November 1799 for the loss of his ships by a court presided by Vice-admiral Th√©venard,Fonds Marine, vol. 1, p. 229 the court found that the superior Ottoman and British forces off Syria, the partial disarmament of the frigates and their low food and water supplies had been legitimate reasons for Perr√©e to return to Toulon. Perr√©e was then honourably acquitted on a unanimous decision of the Council. = Battle of the Malta Convoy = From 28 November, he took command of a naval division tasked to ferry food supplies from Toulon to Malta, with his flag on the 74-gun G√©n√©reux. From 28 November, Perr√©e was appointed to command a small naval division tasked with supplying Malta. The division was composed of the 74-gun G√©n√©reux (under Captain Cyprien Renaudin) as flagship, the 20-gun corvettes Badine and Fauvette, the 16-gun Sans Pareille and the fluyt Ville de Marseille (under Joseph Allemand).Bradford, p. 246Troude, vol.2, p.198 Perr√©e's division departed on 26 January 1800, but soon after, G√©n√©reux broke her mizzen tops and her main topgallant off Hy√®res, and had to double back for repairs. The division set sail again on 10 February 1800 and arrived off La Valette only a week later, due to adverse weather. On 18, off Lampedusa, G√©n√©reux investigated a strange sail which turned out to be a British ship rejoining two sails on the horizon. Perr√©e ordered his squadron to flee, but Ville de Marseille was overhauled by the 74-gun HMS Alexander in the next morning, and struck her colours at 8:30. The rest of the British squadron, comprising the 74-gun HMS Alexander, Northumberland and Foudroyant, and the 32-gun frigate HMS Success, part of Keith's fleet blockading the Malta, continued the chase. In the afternoon, Perr√©e spotted two further ships, HMS Audacious and Lion, in the North-North-West; he ordered his corvettes to adjust course, Sans-Pareille sustaining a broadsite from Alexander in the process, and gave liberty of maneuver to his captains. G√©n√©reux headed East, but found herself surrounded from all directions. Perr√©e had anchors, boats and forage supplies throwned overboard, but at 3:15, the frigate HMS Success audaciously intercepted and engaged the much more powerful G√©n√©reux, hoping to delay her enough for the British ships of the line to catch up. By 4:30, the British 74-guns had overhauled G√©n√©reux and were raking her. A shot from the first broadside threw splinters into Perr√©e's left eye, temporarily blinding him. Remaining on deck, he called to his crew \\"Ce n'est rien, mes amis, continuons notre besogne\\" (\\"It is nothing, my friends, continue with your work\\") and gave orders for the ship to be turned, when a cannonball from the second broadside from Success tore his right leg off at the thigh. Perr√©e collapsed unconscious on the deck.James, Vol. 3, p. 15 G√©n√©reux continued to resist until 5:30, when, overpowered, she struck her colours.Troude, vol.2, p.199 Perr√©e died of his wounds in the evening.

V. et al (2006) BirdLife International have followed this treatment; hence the Magdalena Tinamou was dropped from the 2008 IUCN Red List.BirdLife International (2007)BirdLife International (2008) Etymology Crypturellus is formed from three Latin or Greek words. kruptos meaning covered or hidden, oura meaning tail, and ellus meaning diminutive. Therefore Crypturellus means small hidden tail.Gotch, A. F. (1195) Description The Magdalena tinamou is similar to red-legged tinamou. Its total length is approximately . It is a medium-sized, brown tinamou. Its upperparts are dark ruddy with black barring on rump, it has brown wings that have buff barring, it has paler underparts with dark barring on its lower flanks and vent, and its chin is white with a greyish tinge to its throat. Ecology The type specimen was taken in Ayacucho in the Cesar Department, and the only other known specimen (although its present whereabouts is unknown) was taken near Mariquita in the Tolima Department (often erroneously listed as being in the Neiva Department [sic]). Both are in the Magdalena River Valley of Colombia. This species has traditionally been considered to inhabit of dry deciduous forest and savanna, but the latter is now believed to be mistaken, and the classification of the forest as \\"dry\\" has perhaps been overstated. It may still survive in the few remnant foothill forests on the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental, and also on the eastern slope of the Serran√≠a de San Lucas. The type specimen was taken at an altitude of about 150 m, while the second specimen was taken at an altitude of about 500 m. Status and conservation The Magdalena tinamou is probably threatened from hunting and deforestation. The habitat in which it is found has been heavily modified for agriculture. Large areas of the Magdalena River Valley had been converted to pasture or cultivated as early as the mid-18th century, and most of the remaining wet forest was cleared during a government-sponsored colonisation and infrastructure development programme in the 1960s and 1970s. Flat alluvial portions of the valley are now used for intensive rice and cotton production, while undulating terrain has been converted to pastureland. This left only approximately 1-2% of old secondary and primary forest. However, recent research collected information by local inhabitants suggesting that this bird still survives; tinamous are notoriously cryptic and not easily found. A recording was made near the type locality by Colombian ornithologist Oswaldo Cort√©s in late 2008. In addition to confirming the continued existence of the Magdalena tinamou, it is hoped the recording (the first of the Magdalena tinamou) can be used to better establish its taxonomic status (species or subspecies) through comparisons with recordings of other red-legged tinamou subspecies.Cort√©s, O. (2010). The absence of data beyond plumage (e.g. vocal analysis) was the main arguments presented by the SACC in 2006 for not accepting the Magdalena tinamou as a separate species. No conservation effort is currently underway. However, it was proposed to conduct ornithological surveys and interviews in San Calixto/Convenci√≥n and the foothills on the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental above Pailitas, the eastern foothills of Serran√≠a de San Lucas, and between Pailitas and La Jagua de Ibirico. It was also proposed to locate surviving forest patches using aerial photographs and assess the species's taxonomic position. As mentioned above, the Magdalena tinamou has been removed from the IUCN Red List, where now considered a subspecies of the widespread red-legged tinamou. The Magdalena tinamou was classified as Critically Endangered: D in the 2006 Red List, uplisted from Endangered in 1994.

Until 1993 the main transmitter of this facility, the medium wave transmitter for 882 kHz was run with 250 kilowatts. In that year the transmission power of this transmitter, which was formerly used for transmitting the \\"Voice of DDR\\" and since the beginning of the 1990s for \\"MDR info\\" was reduced to 20 kilowatts. History Since 1988 the transmitter Wachenbrunn has also been the site of a medium wave transmitter of the Russian foreign radio service Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moskau) on 1323 kHz. This transmitter is similar to the transmitter of \\"MDR info\\" run by Deutsche Telekom. In the afternoon and evening, a programme of the Voice of Russia was transmitted in German. With a power of 1000 kW, this transmitter was the third strongest in Germany. It used a directional aerial consisting of four 125.1 metre (407 feet) high guyed steeltube framework masts insulated against ground with triangular cross section. These masts, which were locally called the \\"Russian Quartet\\", were located 800 metres (¬Ω mile) away from the other parts of the facility, in order to avoid undesirable interference. For the transmission of the radio frequency power a cage line from the transmitter, which was located close to the transmitter of \\"MDR info\\" and the \\"Russian Quartet\\", was used until the modernisation of the facility in 2002‚Äì2003. In the course of the modernization, a completely transistorized transmitter with a power of 1,000 kilowatts was installed in an old store building close to the \\"Russian Quartet\\". Therefore, the cage line was for its greatest parts obsolete and therefore shortened. By shortening the transmission line and installation of the new transmitter the efficiency was increased to 84%. During the modernisation the masts of the \\"Russian Quartet\\", which had until that point of time a grey colour, were painted red-white. MDR Info transmissions from Wachenbrunn transmitter on 882 kHz ceased on 30 June 2011. An automated announcement notified listeners until 10:00 on 4 July 2011 of the closure.http://www.radioeins.de/programm/sendungen/medienmagazin/radio_news/beitraege/2011/wachenbrunn_stillgelegt.html The 882 kHz transmitter was demolished on 14 July 2011. The 1323 kHz transmitter used by the Voice of Russia and Universelles Leben was not affected by the closure, as it operated from a separate site located about 1 km from the first. However, the high power has been the cause of complaints from nearby residents about interference to electrical equipment. Voice of Russia announced in December 2012 that they intended to cease medium wave transmissions from Germany for financial reasons from 1 January 2013. Besides Wachenbrunn, this also involved the transmitter sites in Cremlingen-Abbenrode and Wilsdruff. Wachenbrunn transmitter site was switched off as scheduled on 31 December 2012 at 23:00. The remaining four transmitting masts were demolished on 19 September 2013 at 14:55, ending the existence of the transmitter site. =Solar power plant= On 12 March 2015 the construction of a solar power plant started on the location of the former 882 kHz transmitter site. On 13 May 2015 it was connected to the network. Facility As an aerial two guyed steel tube masts insulated against ground with heights of 142.8 metres (464 feet) were used. One of these masts had been a reflector mast at Berlin-K√∂penick transmitter site until 1988, before it was dismantled and rebuilt at Wachenbrunn. This type of transmission aerial allowed a better radiation toward the south-west. Furthermore, until the mid-1990s there was a triangle area aerial and a small guyed mast, which was insulated to ground. Neither installation still exists.

It is also the name given to the Church built in honour of the Virgin Mary in the Blachernae section of Constantinople. The name Blachernae possibly derived from the name of a Vlach (sometimes written as Blach or Blasi), who came to Constantinople from the lower DanubeIlie Gherghel, (1920). (Romanian) Cateva consideratiuni la cuprinsul notiunii cuvantului \\"Vlach\\". Bucuresti: Convorbiri Literare, p.4-8  Byzantine palladium  The Theotokos was considered to be the intercessory protectress par excellence of Constantinople and, indeed, of the entire Eastern Roman Empire (called \\"Byzantium\\" by some modern Western scholars). Blachernitissa is unusual among Orthodox icons in that it is not flat, but is formed in bas relief. According to Sacred Tradition, the icon Blachernitissa was made of wax combined with the ashes of Christian martyrs who had been killed in the 6th century. The Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (which hosted the icon) was sited close to the Blachernae imperial palace. The Theotokos' intercession, asked through veneration and prayer before the icon, was credited with saving Constantinople from the Persians during the reign of Heraclius and later from the Arabs. These miracles are commemorated annually in the Orthodox Church on the Saturday of the Akathist on the Fifth Saturday of Great Lent.  Reappearance  The icon was believed to have been lost after the fire that destroyed the church on February 29, 1434, although in later centuries its disappearance came to be associated with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Like many holy objects of Byzantine tradition, the Blachernitissa (or a copy thereof) resurfaced on Mount Athos in the mid-17th century. Whether it is the same icon that was kept in Blachernae is a matter of scholarly debate, as the ancient icon is believed to have been of the Orans type, whereas the Athonite icon is of a style called Hodegetria (literally, \\"She who leads the way\\").\\"Icon of The Virgin Blachernitissa\\", Art UK It has been suggested that the Athonite icon had its origins in the Blachernae quarter and perhaps even resided in the Church of St. Mary before being transferred to Mount Athos for \\"security reasons\\". It was in 1653 that the icon was sent by the Athonite monks to Moscow as their gift to Tsar Alexis. A Constantinople merchant, Demetrios Costinari, brought it to Moscow on October 16, 1653, with a letter from Patriarch Paisius I that endorsed the icon's authenticity.Nikolay Kapterev. –•–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∫ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–º—É –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫—É –≤ XVI –∏ XVII —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏—è—Ö.

This event is celebrated annually in the Russian Orthodox Church on July 7.  Veneration in Muscovy  Paul of Aleppo, who accompanied the Patriarch of Antioch to Moscow in early 1655, was impressed by the reverence in which the icon was held.

Paul proceeds to describe how the Tsar had it placed in front of his own seat in a sledge and took it with him on the Smolensk campaign. The Syrian clergyman, however, tells a different story about the icon's provenance than that adopted by the Russian Orthodox Church. It was a Constantinople widow who discovered the icon in her house, with an oil lamp burning in front of it. She donated the icon, identified by her as \\"that which Heraclius had had by his side in a Persian campaign\\", to a Jerusalem metochion, whose father superior refused to cede it to the Patriarch, though the latter spared no expense to obtain it. The 1650s were a time when the Russian Church, steered by Patriarch Nikon, began to place great store on renewing its ties with the older members of the Pentarchy. This emphasis dovetailed neatly with the prevailing Third Rome doctrine which saw Moscow as the successor to Constantinople.–§–æ–Ω–∫–∏—á –ë.–Ø. –ì—Ä–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–Ω—ã–µ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ –≤ XV‚ÄìXVII –≤–µ–∫–∞—Ö.

Study and restoration  When placed in the Kremlin, the icon was in disrepair from old age and use, so that Simon Ushakov and Nikita Pavlovets had to be summoned for \\"repairs\\" in 1674. Nikodim Kondakov was unable to determine the icon's age due to this and later restorations, which involved some amount of overpainting, but felt reasonably certain that \\"the composition was of ancient date\\".Nikodim Kondakov. –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ —Ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ –ê—Ñ–æ–Ω–µ.

The carved high relief icon has similarities to a set of 13th-century icons of St. George from the Crimea, Ohrid, and Castoria.

Following the Bolshevik Revolution the icon was removed from the Kremlin to the Vozdvizhenka Church of the Cross's Exultation. Upon the church's demolition, the icon was returned to the Kremlin's museums; it is currently held by the Tretyakov Gallery.  Replicas  The Blachernitissa never rose to the height of veneration accorded by the Russian Orthodox Church to the Theotokos of Kazan or even to the Theotokos of the Iveron, an Athonite icon whose copy was commissioned by Patriarch Nikon. After Nikon's downfall and Alexis's death, the icon was neglected so much that it was not evacuated from the Kremlin during Napoleon's occupation and was put at risk during the Great Fire of 1812. The Theotokos Vlakhernskaya remained a cherished object of personal devotion of the Stroganov, Galitzine, Naryshkin, and Golovin noble families who had commissioned several copies of the icon at the height of its veneration in the mid-17th century. Of these copies, one was kept in a church on the grounds of the Galitzine Palace in the village of Vlakhernskoye near Moscow (to which it lends its name), another was placed by the Naryshkins in the Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, and a third was venerated at the Spaso-Vlakhernsky monastery near Dmitrov.

By 2017 the site was redeveloped with new signage marking it as the \\"Real Birthplace of Silicon Valley.\\"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/council/sfba/announcements/The%20Birthplace%20of%20Silicon%20Valley.pdf Shockley's return to California William Shockley received his undergraduate degree from Caltech and moved east to complete his PhD at MIT with a focus on physics. He graduated in 1936 and immediately went to work at Bell Labs. Through the 1930s and '40s he worked on electron devices, and increasingly with semiconductor materials, pioneering the field of solid state electronics. This led to the 1947 creation of the first transistor, in partnership with John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and others. Through the early 1950s a series of events led to Shockley becoming increasingly upset with Bell's management, and especially what he saw as a slighting when Bell promoted Bardeen and Brattain's names ahead of his own on the transistor's patent. However, others that worked with him suggested the reason for these issues was Shockley's abrasive management style, and it was this reason that he was constantly passed over for promotion within the company. These issues came to a head in 1953 and he took a sabbatical and returned to Caltech as a visiting professor. Shockley struck up a friendship with Arnold Orville Beckman, who had invented the pH meter in 1934. Shockley had become convinced that the natural capabilities of silicon meant it would eventually replace germanium as the primary material for transistor construction. Texas Instruments had recently started production of silicon transistors (in 1954), and Shockley thought he could do one better. Beckman agreed to back Shockley's efforts in this area, under the umbrella of his company, Beckman Instruments. However, Shockley's mother was aging and often ill, and he decided to live closer to her house in Palo Alto. The Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business in a small commercial lot in nearby Mountain View in 1956. Initially he tried to hire some of his former workers from Bell Labs, but none of them wanted to leave the east coast, then the center of most high-tech research. Instead, he assembled a team of young scientists and engineers, some from Bell Laboratories, and set about designing a new type of crystal-growth system that could produce single-crystal silicon boules, at that time a difficult prospect given silicon's high melting point.

The 2N696 transistor and the Shockley four-layer diode behind it are parts of an oscillator circuit.http://www.marywhiteglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Silicon- Valley-Monument-final-book-pdf.pdf While work on the transistors continued, Shockley hit upon the idea of using a four-layer device (transistors are three) that would have the novel quality of locking into the \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" state with no further control inputs. Similar circuits required several transistors, typically three, so for large switching networks the new diodes would greatly reduce complexity.Kurt Hubner, \\"The Four-Layer Diode in the Cradle of Silicon Valley\\" , Electrochemical Society Proceedings, Volume 98-1\\"Historic Transistor Photo Gallery Photo Essay ‚Äì Shockley 4 Layer Diodes\\" The four-layer diode is now called the Shockley diode. Shockley became convinced that the new device would be just as important as the transistor, and kept the entire project secret, even within the company. This led to increasingly paranoid behavior; in one famed incident he was convinced that a secretary's cut finger was a plot to injure him and ordered lie detector tests on everyone in the company. This was combined with Shockley's vacillating management of the projects; sometimes he felt that getting the basic transistors into immediate production was paramount, and would de-emphasize the Shockley diode project in order to make the \\"perfect\\" production system. This upset many of the employees, and mini-rebellions became commonplace., 3 March 1995 Traitorous eight Eventually a group of the youngest employees ‚Äì Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Eugene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Sheldon Roberts ‚Äì went over Shockley's head to Arnold Beckman, demanding that Shockley be replaced. Beckman initially appeared to agree with their demands, but over time made a series of decisions that supported Shockley. Fed up, the group broke ranks and sought support from Fairchild Camera and Instrument, an Eastern U.S. company with considerable military contracts. In 1957, Fairchild Semiconductor was started with plans for making silicon transistors. Shockley called the young scientists the \\"traitorous eight\\" and said they would never be successful. The eight later left Fairchild and started companies of their own. Over a period of 20 years, 65 different companies were started by 1st or 2nd generation teams that traced their origins in Silicon Valley to Shockley Semiconductor.A Legal Bridge Spanning 100 Years: From the Gold Mines of El Dorado to the \\"Golden\\" Startups of Silicon Valley by Gregory Gromov In 2014, Tech Crunch revisited Don Hoefler's 1971 article, claiming 92 public companies of 130 descendant listed firms were then worth over US$2.1 Trillion. They also claimed over 2,000 companies could be traced back to Fairchild's eight co-founders. Shockley never managed to make the four-layer diode a commercial success, in spite of eventually working out the technical details and entering production in the 1960s. The introduction of integrated circuits allowed the multiple transistors needed to produce a switch to be placed on a single \\"chip\\", thereby nullifying the parts-count advantage of Shockley's design. However, the company did have a number of other successful projects, including the first strong theoretical study of solar cells, developing the seminal Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit that places an upper limit of 30% efficiency on basic silicon solar cells.

The hospital was founded in 1880 as \\"The Sydney Hospital for Sick Children\\". Its name was changed to the \\"Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children\\" on 4 January 1904 when King Edward VII granted use of the appellation ‚ÄòRoyal‚Äô and his consort, Queen Alexandra, consented to the use of her name. It is one of three children's hospitals in New South Wales. It is currently located on Hawkesbury Road in Westmead and is affiliated with the University of Sydney. On 1 July 2010, it became part of the newly formed The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network (Randwick and Westmead) incorporating the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children'.  Name and relocation  RAHC CamperdownThe hospital was opened in 1880 as the Sydney Hospital for Sick Children by a group of concerned citizens, led by Lady Allen the wife of Sir George Wigram Allen, who were worried about the health of the younger members of society in New South Wales. It soon outgrew the small building in which it was housed at Glebe Point. In 1906 it moved to a much grander building, designed by Harry Kent in Camperdown, where it stayed for 89 years, where it was known as the Camperdown Children's Hospital.Venables, Lisa. Saving Zali. Macmillan Publishers Australia. 2014. In 1995, the hospital was relocated to its current location in Westmead to better serve the growing populations of western Sydney. This relocation involved amalgamation with most of the paediatric services of nearby Westmead Hospital (apart from neonates) to form a new hospital with a new name; initially \\"The New Children's Hospital\\" and more recently \\"The Children's Hospital at Westmead\\". The official name of the hospital; the \\"Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children\\" is retained. Services The Children's Hospital at Westmead is one of the busiest Children's Hospitals in New South Wales seeing over 80,000 patients annually.

From: Emil Hildebrand, Sveriges historia intill tjugonde seklet (1910). Oscar Josef Alin (22 December 184631 December 1900) was a Swedish historian and politician. Life Alin was born in Falun, Sweden. In 1872 he completed his doctorate and became docent of political science, and in 1882 professor skytteanus of Government and Eloquence at Uppsala University. As professor skytteanus he succeeded Vilhelm Erik Svedelius, whom he also followed in the inspectorship of the university's V√§stmanland-Dalarna Nation. In September 1888 he was elected a member of the first chamber of the Riksdag, where he attached himself to the conservative protectionist party, over which, from the first, he exercised great authority. He retired from the Riksdag in 1899 to become rector magnificus of the university, but died already at the end of the next year. It is as a historian that Alin is most remarkable. Works Among his numerous works the following are especially worthy of note: *Bidrag till svenska r√•dets historia under medeltiden (Upsala 1872); * Sveriges historia, 1511-1611 (Stockholm, 1878); * Bidrag till svenska statskickets historia (Stockholm, 1884‚Äì1887); * Den svensk-norsk unionen (Stockholm, 1889‚Äì1891), the best book on the Norwego-Swedish Union question from the Swedish point of view; * Fjerde artiklen af fredstraktaten i Kiel (Stockholm, 1899); * Carl Johan och Sveriges yttre politik, 1810-1815 (Stockholm, 1899); * Carl XIV Johan och rikets st√§nder, 1840-1841 (Stockholm, 1893).

Peugeot is the largest PSA brand. PSA is listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange and is a constituent of the CAC 40 index. Beginning in 2016, PSA began to outline a strategy which entailed the rapid expansion of the company, through both geographic expansion and acquisitions of other car companies. PSA has announced plans to enter the Indian, American, Canadian, ASEAN, and other markets in the coming years. Headquartered in Rueil-Malmaison, PSA, with sales of 3.88 million units in 2018, was the third-largest Europe-based automaker, just a fraction behind Renault. On 31 October 2019, Groupe PSA announced intent to merge with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. The merger would be on a 50-50 all stock basis. On 18 December 2019, FCA and PSA announced that they had agreed to the terms of a binding $50 billion merger, which as of mid-2020 was pending approval by European competition regulators. As of 16th July 2020, both companies decided to name the merged company \\"Stellantis\\". https://www.carandbike.com/news/fca- groupe-psa-merger-officially-named-stellantis-2263662/amp The name Stellantis is derived from the Latin verb \\"stello\\" which means \\"to brighten with stars\\". History = Citro√´n acquisition = Former Logo from 1991 to 2016 In December 1974 Peugeot S.A. acquired a 38.2% share of Citro√´n. On 9 April 1976https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MZxAAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=GKUMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6208,1716150&dq;=citroen&hl;=en they increased their stake of the then bankrupt company to 89.95%, thus creating the PSA Group (where PSA is short for Peugeot Soci√©t√© Anonyme), becoming PSA Peugeot Citro√´n.Peugeot Motion and Emotion, Corporate interactive history, Undated. Retrieved: 9 April 2012. Since Citro√´n had two successful new designs in the market at this time (the GS and CX) and Peugeot was typically prudent in its own finances, the PSA venture was a financial success from 1976 to 1979. = Chrysler Europe acquisition = In late 1978, PSA purchased the failing Chrysler Europe (which had been Rootes and Simca) from the troubled US parent firm for a nominal US$1.00, plus assumption of outstanding debt, leading to losses for the consortium from 1980 to 1985. Further investment was required because PSA decided to create a new brand for the entity for the disparate French and British models, based on the Talbot sports car last seen in the 1950s. From then on, the whole Chrysler/Simca range was sold under the Talbot badge until production of Talbot-branded passenger cars was shelved in 1987 and on commercial vehicles in 1992. All of this investment caused serious financial problems for the entire PSA group; PSA lost money from 1980 to 1985. There were some bright spots, however: mainly thanks to the success of the Peugeot 205 and in spite of Talbot sales withering away, PSA surpassed Renault in sales in the domestic French market for the first time in 1983. In 1987, the company dropped the Talbot brand for passenger cars when it ceased production of the Simca-developed Horizon; the Samba and Alpine/Solara had been discontinued a year earlier. What was to have been the Talbot Arizona became the Peugeot 309, with the former Rootes plant in Ryton and Simca plant in Poissy being turned over for Peugeot assembly from October 1985. Producing Peugeots in Ryton was significant, as it signaled the first time that PSA would build cars in the UK (car assembly at Ryton stopped in 2006 and the plant was closed). The Talbot name survived for a little longer on commercial vehicles until 1992 before being shelved completely. From 1987 to 1995, the Ryton plant also produced the Peugeot 405 saloon. Philippe Varin in Berlin, 2013 = Crisis (2012‚Äì2014) = On 29 February 2012, PSA announced the creation of a major alliance with General Motors (GM), as part of which GM became PSA's second-largest shareholder, after the Peugeot family, with a holding of 7%. The alliance was intended to enable $2 billion per year of cost savings through platform sharing, common purchasing and other economies of scale. In July 2012, a union official said that PSA Peugeot Citro√´n would cut as much as 10 percent (8,000-10,000) of its French workforce of 100,356 employees on permanent and temporary contract. The jobs cut was more than previously announced. On 24 October, PSA said it was close to an agreement with creditor banks on ‚Ç¨11.5 billion ($14.9 billion) of refinancing and had won state guarantees on ‚Ç¨7 billion in further borrowing by its Banque PSA Finance. On 12 December 2013, General Motors announced it was selling its 7% stake in PSA Peugeot Citro√´n to Padmapriya Automobile Investment Group. In 2014, Dongfeng Motor Group, the Chinese partner that builds PSA cars in China, and the French government each took a 13% stake in PSA, in a financial rescue operation, reducing the Peugeot family share from 25% to 14%. = Rapid expansion (2014‚Äìpresent) = Following Dongfeng and the French government each acquiring stakes in Groupe PSA, various cost-cutting measures at the company turned its fortune around and gradually reduced PSA's debt, until the company began to turn a profit beginning in 2015. A new CEO, Carlos Tavares, was engaged and began to implement various cost-cutting measures and expanded the model range of all three core brands, alongside the creation of a new brand, DS Automobiles. In early 2016, PSA unveiled a roadmap detailing its plan to re-enter the North American car market for the first time since 1991. Although many only expected the DS to enter the North American market, PSA announced that all of its brands would be sold across the continent. The plan to re- enter the market has three-stages, be a partner in a vehicle for hire, then begin renting and sharing PSA's own vehicles to the public several years after, followed by a full launch, and establishing a dealer network in 2020. Acquisition of 'Ambassador' brand from Hindustan Motors On 10 February 2017, PSA announced a 50:50 joint venture with the CK Birla Group, the owner of the Hindustan Motors to sell Peugeot, Citr√∂en, and DS vehicles in India and purchase of the Ambassador brand from Hindustan Motors at the cost of INR 80 Crore. This marks the first time in over twenty years that PSA will be selling cars in India. Acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall Motors On 14 February 2017 PSA announced that it was in talks to acquire Opel and Vauxhall Motors from General Motors. The talks were in an advanced stage, but were a surprise to the press and to much of Opel's leadership as they had plans to transform the company into an electric-car-only brand using the platform of the Opel Ampera-e for a wide range of models. GM agreed to continue to supply PSA with Ampera-e and other electric vehicle technology.http://www.autoguide.com/auto- news/2017/03/gm-officially-sells-opel-to-france-s-psa-group.html GM reported a loss of US$257 million from its European operations on 2016, sixteenth consecutive loss-making year for GM in Europe, bringing its amount of losses on the continent since 2000 to more than US$15 billion. Some expressed concerns about what this major acquisition might do to PSA's bottom line. However, due to this amount of debt, it is likely that GM may give the brands to PSA, or sell Opel and Vauxhall at a highly reduced price. Tavares expects synergies a decade after the takeover. PSA CEO Carlos Tavares met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May at separate meetings where he toured some of Opel and Vauxhall's operations in Germany and the UK, respectively. He assured the leaders that jobs would be safeguarded and that Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant was to be used by PSA at least until 2021. Tavares announced that he wants Opel to keep its German brand identity and to embrace it, and that he would leverage Opel's pedigree of German engineering and Motorsport and use the company's heritage to reach markets and customers that may not consider a French car due to perceived reliability issues. He also announced that the Opel and Vauxhall brands would be elevated to new heights within Groupe PSA, including the sale of Opel and Vauxhall- branded vehicles outside Europe for the first time in many decades. He also acknowledged the possibility of the Opel and Vauxhall brands being instrumental in the launch of Groupe PSA in North America. Opel and Vauxhall vehicles will also likely be sold in South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East. PSA plans to continue using some of Opel's existing platforms and models, many of which are shared with GM, at least for a few years until the entire model range is updated and will only feature PSA platforms. GM has discussed the possibility of handing over various patents, technologies, and platforms to PSA in exchange for PSA's taking responsibility for a portion of Opel employees' pensions, which it seems PSA has agreed to. Bid for Proton On 17 February 2017, PSA announced its bid to acquire PROTON Holdings, which owns the Proton and Lotus brands, but lost out to Geely a few months later. = Merger with FCA = In May 2019 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) announced its intention to seek a merger with Groupe Renault. However, in early June merger talks were suspended, and never resumed. On October 31, 2019 Groupe PSA announced intent to merge with FCA. The merger would be on a 50-50 all stock basis. On 18 December 2019, FCA and PSA announced that they had agreed to the terms of a binding $50 billion merger, expected to be implemented in the next 12 months. The new group will be incorporated in the Netherlands and have John Elkann as Chairman of the Board and Carlos Tavares as CEO. On July 15, 2020, the two companies announced that the merged entity will be named Stellantis, from the \\"Latin verb 'stello' meaning 'to brighten with stars.'\\" Operations The Peugeot, Citro√´n and DS Automobiles brands retain separate sales and marketing structures, but share common technology, development and assembling assets.

The city is located on the River Niger, east-southeast of Timbuktu on the left bank at the junction with the Tilemsi valley. For much of its history Gao was an important commercial centre involved in the trans-Saharan trade. In the 9th century external Arabic writers described Gao as an important regional power, and by the end of the 10th century, the local ruler was said to be a Muslim. Towards the end of the 13th century Gao became part of the Mali Empire, but in first half of the 15th century the town regained its independence and with the conquests of Sunni Ali (ruled 1464‚Äì1492) it became the capital of the Songhai Empire. The Empire collapsed after the Moroccan invasion in 1591 and the invaders chose to make Timbuktu their capital. By the time of Heinrich Barth's visit in 1854, Gao had declined to become an impoverished village with 300 huts constructed from matting. In 2009, the urban commune had a population of 86,633. On 31 March 2012, Gao was captured from Malian government forces by National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and Ansar Dine rebels. After the additional captures of Kidal and Timbuktu, on 6 April, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad and named Gao its capital. The MNLA lost control to Islamist militias after the Battle of Gao on 26 and 27 June 2012. On 26 January 2013, the city was recaptured by French military forces as part of Op√©ration Serval..  Geography  = Location = Gao is located on the eastern bank of the Niger River at the junction with the Tilemsi Valley. The sprawling town is the largest in eastern Mali. It is connected to the capital, Bamako at the western end of Mali, by 1200 km (750 mi) of paved road. In 2006, the Wabaria bridge was inaugurated to replace the ferry service across the Niger. The bridge was constructed by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation and financed by the Islamic Development Bank and the Malian government. The town is strategically located with road links (unpaved) to the desert Kidal Region to the north and to Niamey, the capital of Niger, to the south. The road to the south runs along the left bank of the river. The town of Ansongo is 103 km (65 mi) from Gao. The border with Niger is just south of the village of Labb√©zanga, a distance of 204 km (127 mi). The prime meridian marker runs right through Gao, Mali. There are also seasonal ferry services on the Niger River. A service between Gao and Koulikoro, a distance of 1380 km (860 mi), is managed by the Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV). It usually operates from the end of July, after the annual rains when there is sufficient water in the river, until mid November. Smaller boats are able to operate for a longer season between Bourem and Ansongo. The town is expanding rapidly. In the 1998 census, the population of the urban commune was 52,201. By the census in 2009 this had increased to 86,633, a 4.7% annual growth rate. For administrative purposes, the commune is divided into nine quartiers: Gadeye, Farandjir√©, Aljanabanbia, Djoulabougou, Saneye, Sosso Ko√Øra, Boulgoundj√©, Ch√¢teau, and Djidara.. The urban commune is bounded to the north by the commune of Soni Ali Ber, to the east by the commune of Anchawadi and to the south and west by the commune of Gounzoureye. = Climate = Gao features an arid climate under K√∂ppen's climate classification. Gao's climate is hot and dry, with the only rainfall occurring between June and September. August is normally the wettest month. The average annual rainfall is only 220 mm, but there are large year-to-year variations. May is the hottest month, with an average daily high temperature of 43 ¬∞C. December and January are the coolest months, with daily low temperatures of 15 ¬∞C. From October to March during the dry period, the north-easterly Harmattan wind blows from the Sahara. When it blows strongly the dust-laden wind reduces visibility and creates a persistent haze. With the low rainfall the vegetation away from the river is sparse and consists mainly of various species of Acacia (Acacia raddiana, Acacia nilotica, Acacia ehrenbergiana) and Balanites aegyptiaca. The herbaceous plants are dominated by Cenchrus biflorus and Panicum laetum. = Annual flood of the Niger River = Almost all the local agriculture depends on river water for irrigation. The annual flood of the Niger River is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and Bani rivers in Guinea and the northern Ivory Coast. The rainfall in the headwater areas peaks in August but the flood water takes time to pass down the river system, through the Inner Niger Delta region and arrive at Gao. At Koulikoro the flood peaks in September,. while in Gao the flood lasts longer and reaches a maximum in December.. There is a large year-to-year variation in the extent of the flooding. The existing and proposed dams upstream of Gao reduce the overall flow of the river and could potentially have a large effect on the local agriculture.. When in flood the river is 4 km wide at Gao but during the dry season a number of islands appear in the river. There is very little flow, only 5% of the maximum, in June and July.  History  The history of the Gao Empire precedes that of the Songhai Empire in the region of the Middle Niger. Both empires had the town of Gao as their capital. Apart from some Arabic epitaphs on tombstones discovered in 1939 at the cemetery of Gao-Saney (6 km to the east of the city); ; there are no surviving indigenous written records that date from before the middle of the 17th century. Our knowledge of the early history of the town relies on the writings of Arabic geographers living in Morocco, Egypt and Andalusia, most of whom never visited the region. These authors referred to the town as Kawkaw or Kuku. The two key 17th century chronicles, the Tarikh al-Sudan and the Tarikh al-fattash, provide information on the town at the time of the Songhai Empire but they contain relatively little on the social and economic history. The chronicles do not, in general, acknowledge their sources. Their accounts for the earlier periods are almost certainly based on oral tradition and for events before the second half of the 15th century they are likely to be less reliable. For these earlier periods, the two chronicles sometimes provide conflicting information. The earliest mention of Gao is by al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ who wrote in the first half of the 9th century when Gao was already an important regional power. Al-Yaqubi wrote in his Tarikh in around 872: > There is the kingdom of the Kawkaw, which is the greatest of the realms of > the S≈´dƒÅn, the most important and most powerful. All the kingdoms obey its > king. Al-Kawkaw is the name of the town. Besides this there are a number of > kingdoms of which the rulers pay allegiance to him and acknowledge his > sovereignty, although they are kings in their own lands.; Ibn al-Faqih (writing c. 903) mentions a caravan route from Egypt to ancient Ghana via Kawkaw, but Ibn Hawqal (writing c. 988) states that the old route from Egypt to the Sudan was abandoned in the reign of the Egyptian ruler Ibn Tulun (ruled 868‚Äì884) as some of the caravans were attacked by bandits while others were overwhelmed by the wind-blown sand. The more direct route was replaced by one that went to Sijilmasa before heading south across the Sahara. In the 10th century, Gao is already Muslim and is described as consisting of two separate towns. Al-Muhallabi, who died in 990, wrote in a lost work quoted in the biographical dictionary compiled by Yaqut: > Their king pretends before his subject to be a Muslim and most of them > pretend to be Muslims too. He has a town on the Nile [Niger], on the eastern > bank, which is called SarnƒÅh, where there are markets and trading houses and > to which there is continuous traffic from all parts. He has another town to > the west of the Nile [Niger] where he and his men and those who have his > confidence live. There is a mosque there where he prays but the communal > prayer ground is between the two towns. The archaeological evidence suggests that there were two settlements on the eastern bank of the Niger: Gao Ancien situated within the modern town, to the east of the Tomb of Askia, and the archaeological site of Gao-Saney (San√© in French) situated around 4 km to the east. The bed of the Wadi Gangaber passes to the south of the Gao-Saney occupation mound (tell) but to the north of Gao Ancien. The imported pottery and glass recovered from Gao-Saney suggest that the site was occupied between the 8th and 13th centuries. It is possible that Gao-Saney corresponds to SarnƒÅh of al-Muhallabi. Al-Bakri writing in 1068 also records the existence of two towns, but al-Idrisi writing in around 1154 does not. Both al-Muhallabi (see quote above) and al-Bakri situate Gao on the west (or right bank) of the Niger. The 17th century Tarikh al-fattash also states that in the 10th century Gao was situated on the Gourma side (i.e. the west bank) of the river.; A large sand dune, La Dune Rose, lies on the west bank opposite Gao, but at Koima, on the edge of the dune at a site 4 km north of Gao, surface deposits indicate a pre 9th century settlement. This could be the west bank Gao mentioned by 10th and 11th-century authors. The site has not been excavated. Al-Sadi in his Tarikh al-Sudan gives a slightly later date for the introduction of Islam. He lists 32 rulers of the Zuwa dynasty and states that in 1009‚Äì1010 A.D. the 15th ruler, Zuwa Kusoy, was the first to convert to Islam.A similar list of rulers is given in the Tarikh al-fattash. He does not actually specify where they lived except for the legendary founder of the dynasty, Zuwa Alayman who he claims came from the Yemen to Kukiya.Kukiya is a town mentioned in the Tarikh al-sudan and the Tarikh al-fattash (as Ko√ªkiya in the French translation). It is believed to have been near the modern village of Bentiya on the east side of the Niger 134 km southeast of Gao near . Tombstones with Arabic inscriptions dating from the 14th and 15th centuries have been found in the area. Towards the end of the 13th century Gao lost its independence and became part of the expanding Mali Empire. What happened to the Zuwa rulers is not recorded. Ibn Battuta visited Suleyman (mansa) in Gao in 1352‚Äì53, when the town formed part of the Mali Empire. He arrived by boat from Timbuktu on his return journey from visiting the capital of the Empire: > Then I travelled to the town of Kawkaw, which is a great town on the Nƒ´l > [Niger], one of the finest, biggest, and most fertile cities of the S≈´dƒÅn. > There is much rice there, and milk, and chickens, and fish, and the > cucumber, which has no like. Its people conduct their buying and selling > with cowries, like the people of MƒÅlƒ´. People at Gao in the early 1930s Gao in the early 1930s After staying a month in the town, Ibn Battuta left with a caravan for Takedda and from there headed north back across the Sahara to an oasis in Tuat with a large caravan that included 600 slave girls. Sometime in the 14th century, Ali Kulun, the first ruler of the Sunni dynasty, rebelled against the Malian hegemony but the Malians were able to regain control. It was not until the first half of the 15th century that Sunni Sulayman Dama was able to throw off the Malian yoke. His successor, Sunni Ali Ber (1464‚Äì1492), greatly expanded the territory under Songhai control and established the Songhai Empire. He made Gao his capital. Leo Africanus visited Gao sometime between 1506 and 1510 when the town was ruled by Askiya Muhammad I, the first ruler of the Askiya Dynasty. He observed that the large town lacked a surrounding wall and was full of rich merchants. > The town is very civilized compared to Timbuktu. Bread and meat are > abundant, though you cannot find wine or fruits. Actually, melons, > cucumbers, and excellent squash are plentiful, and there are enormous > quantities of rice. There are many sweet water wells. There is a square > where on market days huge numbers of slaves are sold, both male and female. > A young girl of fifteen is worth about six ducats, and a young man almost as > much; small children are worth about half as much as grown slaves. Towards the end of the 16th century, Gao controlled an empire that extended for over 1,400,000 km2, an area comparable in size to the modern state of Mali. The Tarikh al-fattash reports that a survey conducted during the reign of Askiya Al-Hajj (1582‚Äì1586) found that there were 7,626 houses without counting the huts made of straw. Assuming each house was occupied by an average of 6 people, this would imply a population of around 45,000. The Moroccan invasion of 1591 led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire. The invaders chose to make Timbuktu their capital and the importance of Gao declined. The German explorer Heinrich Barth visited Gao in 1854 on his return journey from Timbuktu. He found a village of about 300 huts constructed of matting and grouped in clusters. The inhabitants were very poor and had only a few boats as they lacked wood for their construction. The site of the ancient town was overgrown with Capparis decidua bushes. The town remained small until French rule was imposed in the early twentieth century, expanding the port and establishing a colonial base. = Recent history = French soldiers on patrol in Gao in 2013 On 31 March 2012, one day after the capture of Kidal, Malian military forces retreated from Gao's military bases, allowing it to be occupied by Tuareg rebellion member groups MNLA and Ancar Dine. Timbuktu was captured the following day. On 6 April, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad. After the Battle of Gao on 26 and 27 June 2012, the MNLA lost control to Islamist militias. After the 2012 rebellion forced the Malian Army out of Gao and the state of Azawad was proclaimed, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad took control of the governor's building, flying the flag of Azawad over it and rechristening it the Palace of Azawad. On 26 June 2012, the tension came to all-out combat in Gao between the MNLA and MOJWA, with both sides firing heavy weapons. MNLA Secretary General Bilal ag Acherif was wounded in the battle. The MNLA were soon driven from the city, and from Kidal and Timbuktu shortly after. However, the MNLA stated that it continued to maintain forces and control some rural areas in the region. The following day, Ansar Dine announced that it was in control of all the cities of northern Mali. On 19 January 2013, it was reported that Gao journalist Kader Toure was killed after being suspected of working for foreign news services. In retaliation, the local youth are reported to have lynched Islamic police commissioner Aliou Toure who was recruited by MUWA, Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, who took control of the town in June 2012.. In January 2013 French warplanes bombed parts of Gao, including the airport, in an attempt to drive out fighters from the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa. Gao was captured by French and Malian forces on 26 January 2013, as the Islamists were driven out from the city. On 17 March 2015, a United Nations AH-64 helicopter crashed during an exercise near the town, killing both pilots. The AH-64 came from the Dutch Air Force's Defense Helicopter Command. On 18 January 2017, a suicide bomber from Al-Mourabitoun drove a vehicle filled with explosives into a military camp near Gao, killing 77 people and injuring at least 115 (see 2017 Gao bombing). The incident was the deadliest terrorist attack in Malian history.  Culture  The population of Gao mostly speak Songhay but includes many ethnicities, including the Bozo (traditionally nomadic river dwellers), Fulfulde/Fulani cattle keepers, and Tuareg nomads, Arabs as well as Bambara peoples from western Mali. The seventh Festival des arts et cultures songhay was celebrated in February 2007 at Gao, reflecting the city's importance as a Songhay cultural capital.Festival des arts et cultures Songhay: Un facteur d‚Äô√©panouissement de la r√©gion de Gao, Les Echos du 14 f√©vrier 2007  Sites  Attractions in Gao include the original fourteenth century Gao Mosque, the Askia Tomb (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) built in 1495 and incorporating another mosque, a museum devoted to the Sahel, markets including a night market, and La Dune Rose, a sand dune named after its appearance at dawn and nightfall.

He was a Christian, from a Jewish background. He is known for his formulation of Hegel as 'the Protestant Aquinas'. His Jewish ancestry led him to be 'suspended' (dismissed) under Nazi legislation in 1934, from his university position at Kiel. He was replaced briefly by Hans-Georg Gadamer, a personal friend. The American philosopher Otis Lee studied with Kroner for the academic year 1933‚Äì1934 and helped him escape to the United States and find a new academic position at Manhattan's Union Theological Seminary. Kroner's ideas on Hegel, including his slant from Kierkegaard, were taken up by some existentialist thinkers, including Lev Shestov and Nikolai Berdyaev. Works *Zweck und Gesetz in der Biologie.

Filo-based pastries are made by layering many sheets of filo brushed with oil or butter; the pastry is then baked. History The origin of the current practice of stretching raw dough into paper-thin sheets is highly debated. The 11th century Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk by Mahmud Kashgari records the meaning of yurgha, an archaic term for yufka, as \\"pleated or folded bread\\". (Yufka is the Turkish language term for filo, as well as for a kind of thin unleavened bread.) The mention of filo is documented in the Topkapƒ± Palace during the time of the Ottoman Empire.Perry, Charles. \\"The Taste for Layered Bread among the Nomadic Turks and the Central Asian Origins of Baklava\\", in A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East (ed. Sami Zubaida, Richard Tapper), 1994. Preparation Preparation of custard bougatsa in an Athens cafe. Filo dough is made with flour, water and a small amount of oil. Homemade filo takes time and skill, requiring progressive rolling and stretching to a single thin and very large sheet. A very big table is used, preferably with a marble top. If the dough is stretched by hand, a long, thin rolling pin is used, with continual flouring between layers to prevent the sheets from sticking to one another. In modern times, mechanical rollers are also used. Prior to World War I, households in Istanbul typically had two filo makers to prepare razor thin sheets for baklava, and the relatively thicker sheets used for b√∂rek. Fresh and frozen versions are prepared for commercial markets. Use When using filo to make pastries, the thin layers are made by first rolling out the sheets of dough to the final thickness, then brushing them with oil, or melted butter for some desserts, and stacking them. This contrasts with puff pastry and croissant doughs, where the layers are stacked into a thick layer of dough, then folded and rolled out multiple times to produce a laminated dough containing thin layers of dough and fat. Filo can be used in many ways: layered, folded, rolled, or ruffled, with various fillings. = List of filo- based pastries = * Baklava ‚Äì Ottoman dessert with layers of filo with chopped nuts, sweetened and held together with syrup or honey. * Banitsa ‚Äì A Bulgarian dish consisting of eggs, cheese and filo baked in the oven. * B√∂rek ‚Äì A savory Ottoman filo pie * Bougatsa ‚Äì A type of Greek breakfast pastry. * B√ºlb√ºl yuvasƒ± ‚Äì A Turkish dessert with pistachios and syrup. * Bundevara ‚Äì A Serbian sweet pie filled with pumpkin. * Galaktoboureko ‚Äì A Greek dessert consisting of filo and semolina custard. * Gibanica ‚Äì A Serbian dish made from filo, white cheese, and eggs. * Kasseropita ‚Äì A Greek pie made from filo and kasseri cheese. * Pastizz ‚Äì A savory pastry from Malta filled with ricotta or mushy peas. * Spanakopita ‚Äì A Greek spinach pie. * Strudel ‚Äì Filo wrapped around a filling such as cooked, sweetened apple pieces. * Tiropita ‚Äì A Greek dish similar to B√∂rek, filled with a cheese-egg mixture. * Zelnik ‚Äì A savory pie from the Balkans.

More recently, the term refers to many molecular hosts, including calixarenes and cyclodextrins and even some inorganic polymers such as zeolites. The natural silica clathrate mineral, chibaite was described from Japan in 2008. Many clathrates are derived from organic hydrogen-bonded frameworks. These frameworks are prepared from molecules that \\"self-associate\\" by multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. The most famous clathrates are methane clathrates where the hydrogen-bonded framework is contributed by water and the guest molecules are methane. Large amounts of methane naturally frozen in this form exist both in permafrost formations and under the ocean sea-bed. Other hydrogen-bonded networks are derived from hydroquinone, urea, and thiourea. A much studied host molecule is Dianin's compound.

These two murders are commonly referred to as the \\"double event\\".Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114‚Äì140 Part of a left kidney was later sent to the leader of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee accompanied by a letter addressed From Hell. The author of this letter claimed the section of kidney was from Eddowes, whose left kidney had been removed. Most experts, however, do not believe this kidney actually originated from Eddowes's body.  Early life  Catherine Eddowes (also known as \\"Kate Conway\\" and \\"Kate Kelly\\" after her two successive common-law husbands) was born in Graiseley Green, Wolverhampton on 14 April 1842. Her parents were tinplate worker George Eddowes and his wife, Catherine (n√©e Evans). The family moved to London a year after her birth, and her mother ultimately bore 10 other children. By 1857, both of Eddowes's parents had died,Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History p. 211 resulting in Eddowes being admitted as an orphan to a Bermondsey Workhouse.Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History p. 235 She later returned to Wolverhampton where an aunt obtained employment for her as a tinplate stamper at the Old Hall Works. Eddowes was soon fired from this employment, possibly after being caught stealing. She moved from Wolverhampton to Birmingham, where she briefly lived with an uncle. Eddowes worked as a tray polisher in Birmingham for four months before returning to Wolverhampton. Nine months later, she again moved to Birmingham.Jack the Ripper: The Facts p. 165 While residing in Birmingham, she began a relationship with former soldier Thomas Conway, with whom she had two children.Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History p. 235 Eddowes had the initials \\"TC\\" tattooed in blue ink on her left forearm.Casebook: Jack The Ripper Eddowes was five feet tall, with dark auburn hair and hazel eyes. Friends described her as \\"a very jolly woman, always singing\\"Inquest testimony of lodging-house deputy Frederick William Wilkinson, quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 218 and Marriott, p. 136 and an \\"intelligent and scholarly (individual), but possessed of a fierce temper.\\" =Relocation to London= In 1868, Eddowes and Conway moved to London, taking lodgings in Westminster. A third child was born.Naming Jack the Ripper: New Crime Scene Evidence, A Stunning Forensic Breakthrough p. 60 While in London, Eddowes took to drinking. She left her family in 1880. By the following year, she was living with a new partner, John Kelly, at Cooney's common lodging-house at 55 Flower and Dean Street, Spitalfields, at the centre of London's most notorious criminal rookery. Here she took to casual sex work to pay the rent.Begg (2006), pp. 166‚Äì167; White, pp. 323‚Äì349 To avoid contact with his former partner, Conway drew his army pension under the assumed name of Quinn, and kept their sons' addresses secret from her.Fido, p. 67 When Eddowes could not afford a bed in a common lodging-house, she is believed to have slept rough in the front room of 26 Dorset Street, known locally as \\"the shed\\".Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, p. 275 1888 In the summer of 1888, Eddowes, Kelly, and a friend named Emily Birrell took casual work hop-picking in Kent. At harvest's end they returned to London and quickly spent their pay. Eddowes and Kelly split their last sixpence between them; he took fourpence to pay for a bed in the common lodging-house, and she took twopence, just enough for her to stay a night at Mile End Casual Ward in the neighbouring parish.Fido, p. 68 =29 September= In the early afternoon of 29 September, Eddowes told Kelly she would go to Bermondsey to try to get some money from her daughter, Annie Phillips,Evans and Rumbelow, p. 114 who was married to a gun-maker in Southwark.Evans and Skinner, p. 197; Fido, p. 67 With money from pawning his boots, a bare-footed Kelly took a bed at the lodging-house just after 8:00 p.m., and according to the deputy keeper remained there all night.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 114‚Äì115 At 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, 29 September, Eddowes was found lying drunk in the road on Aldgate High Street by PC Louis Robinson. She was taken into custody and then to Bishopsgate police station, where she was detained, giving the name \\"Nothing\\", until she was sober enough to leave at 1:00 a.m. on the morning of 30 September.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 115; Evans and Skinner, pp. 209‚Äì210; Fido, p. 43 Mitre Square. The body of Catherine Eddowes was discovered close to the fence seen at the centre of this image on 30 September 1888 =30 September= Prior to her release, Eddowes gave her name and address as \\"Mary Ann Kelly of 6 Fashion Street\\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 116; Evans and Skinner, pp. 195, 210 Upon leaving the station, instead of turning right to take the shortest route to her home in Flower and Dean Street, Eddowes turned left in the general direction of Aldgate.Evans and Skinner, p. 195; Fido, p. 43 She was last seen alive at 1:35 a.m. by three witnesses, Joseph Lawende, Joseph Hyam Levy and Harry Harris, who themselves had just left a club on Duke Street.Jack the Ripper: The Facts p. 171 She was standing talking with a man at the entrance to Church Passage, which led south-west from Duke Street to Mitre Square along the south wall of the Great Synagogue of London. Only Lawende could furnish a description of the man, whom he described as a fair-moustached man wearing a navy jacket, peaked cloth cap, and red scarf.Fido, pp. 43‚Äì45 Chief Inspector Donald Swanson intimated in his report that Lawende's identification of the woman as Eddowes was doubtful. He wrote that Lawende had said that some clothing of the deceased's that he was shown resembled that of the woman he sawEvans and Rumbelow, p. 122‚Äî\\"which was black ... that was the extent of his identity [sic]\\".Evans and Skinner, p. 185 A patrolling policeman, PC James Harvey, walked down Church Passage from Duke Street very shortly afterwards but his beat took him back down Church Passage to Duke Street, without entering the square.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 120; Fido, p. 44 Murder At 1:45 a.m., Eddowes's mutilated body was found in the south-west corner of Mitre Square by the square's beat policeman PC Edward Watkins.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 117; Fido, p. 45 Watkins said he entered the square at 1:44 a.m. having previously been there at 1:30 a.m. He called for assistance at a tea warehouse in the square, where night watchman George James Morris, who was an ex-policeman, had noticed nothing unusual.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 120; Evans and Skinner, p. 211; Fido, p. 45 Neither had another watchman (George Clapp) at 5 Mitre Square or an off-duty policeman (Richard Pearse) at 3 Mitre Square.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 122; Evans and Skinner, p. 212; Fido, p. 45 Eddowes's body, photographed prior to her post-mortem at the Golden Lane mortuaryJack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia p. 52 Post-mortem The subsequent post-mortem records of police surgeon Dr. Frederick Gordon Brown‚Äîwho arrived at the crime scene after 2:00 a.m.‚Äîstate: Brown conducted a post-mortem upon Eddowes's body that afternoon, noting: Mortuary photograph of Eddowes after her post-mortem Mortuary photograph of Eddowes's face and neck Eddowes was killed and mutilated in the square between 1:35 and 1:45 a.m.e.g. testimony of Dr Brown, quoted in Marriott, p. 145 Police physician Thomas Bond, disagreed with Brown's assessment of the killer's skill level. Bond's report to police stated: \\"In each case the mutilation was inflicted by a person who had no scientific nor anatomical knowledge. In my opinion he does not even possess the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer or any person accustomed to cut up dead animals.\\"Letter from Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, 10 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C ff. 220‚Äì223, quoted in Evans and Skinner, pp. 360‚Äì362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145‚Äì147 Local surgeon Dr George William Sequeira, who was the first doctor at the scene, and City medical officer William Sedgwick Saunders, who was also present at the autopsy, also thought that the killer lacked anatomical skill and did not seek particular organs.Sequeira's inquest testimony quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 128; Evans and Skinner, p. 208; Fido, p. 75; and Marriott, p. 144; Saunders's inquest testimony quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 208 and Fido, p. 75 In addition to the abdominal wounds, the murderer had cut Eddowes's face: across the bridge of the nose, on both cheeks, and through the eyelids of both eyes. The tip of her nose and part of one ear had been cut off. The Royal London Hospital on Whitechapel Road preserves some contemporary crime scene drawings and plans of the Mitre Square murder by the City Surveyor Frederick Foster;Evans and Rumbelow, p. 129 they were first brought to public attention in 1966 by Francis Camps, Professor of Forensic Medicine at London University.Camps, Francis E. (April 1966) \\"More About Jack the Ripper\\", London Hospital Gazette, reprinted in the February 1968 edition of The Criminologist, quoted in Wilson and Odell, p. 123 Based on his analysis of the surviving documents, Camps concluded that \\"the cuts shown on the body could not have been done by an expert.\\"Camps in Medical News, quoted in Wilson and Odell, p. 123 The Eddowes inquest was opened on 4 October by Samuel F. Langham, coroner for the City of London,Marriott, pp. 132‚Äì144; Whitehead and Rivett, p. 68 at the City of London Mortuary. A house-to-house search was conducted but nothing suspicious was discovered. Brown stated his belief that Eddowes was killed by a slash to the throat as she lay on the ground, and then mutilated.Evans and Skinner, p. 223 13 October 1888 edition of The Illustrated Police News depicting the discovery of Eddowes's body Investigation A mustard tin containing two pawn tickets issued to Emily Birrell and Anne Kelly was discovered among Eddowes's personal possessions. These eventually led to her identification by John Kelly as his common-law wife, after he read about the tickets in the newspapers.Evans and Skinner, pp. 194‚Äì197; Fido, p. 67 His identification was confirmed by Catherine Eddowes's sister, Eliza Gold.Evans and Skinner, p. 199; Marriott, p. 134; Wilson and Odell, p. 41 No money was found on her.Evans and Skinner, p. 202; Wilson and Odell, p. 42 Though the murder occurred within the City of London, it was close to the boundary of Whitechapel where the previous Whitechapel murders had occurred. The mutilation of Eddowes's body and the abstraction of her left kidney and part of her womb by her murderer bore the signature of Jack the Ripper and was very similar in nature to that of earlier victim Annie Chapman. Due to the location of Mitre Square, the City of London Police under Detective Inspector James McWilliam joined the murder enquiry alongside the Metropolitan Police who had been engaged in the previous murders. At about 3 a.m. on the same day as Eddowes was murdered, a blood-stained fragment of her apron contaminated with fecal matter was found lying in the passage of the doorway leading to Flats 108 and 119, Model Dwellings, Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Above it on the wall was a graffito in chalk commonly held to have read: \\"The Juwes are the men that Will not be Blamed for nothing\\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 132; Fido, pp. 47‚Äì49 The writing may or may not have been related to the murder, but either way it was washed away before dawn on the orders of Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Charles Warren, who feared that it would spark anti-Jewish riots.Letter from Charles Warren to the Home Office Undersecretary of State, 6 November 1888, quoted in Begg (2003), p. 197; Evans and Skinner, pp. 183‚Äì184 and Marriott, p. 159 Mitre Square had three connecting streets: Church Passage to the north-east, Mitre Street to the south-west, and St James's Place to the north-west. As PC Harvey saw no-one from Church Passage, and PC Watkins saw no-one from Mitre Street, the murderer must have left the square northwards through St James's Place towards Goulston Street.Fido, p. 77; Marriott, p. 127 Goulston Street was within a quarter of an hour's walk from Mitre Square, on a direct route to Flower and Dean Street where Eddowes lived, hinting that her murderer also resided nearby and headed back there after the killing.Inquest testimony of surveyor Frederick William Foster, quoted in Evans and Skinner, pp. 201‚Äì202, 220 and Fido, p. 76 Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, claimed in his memoirs to have discovered bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly running out of the basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash his hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect.Fido, pp. 50, 120 There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 133 \\"From Hell\\" letter, received by George Lusk of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee on 16 October 1888 Correspondence On 1 October, a postcard, dubbed the \\"Saucy Jacky\\" postcard and signed \\"Jack the Ripper\\", was received by the Central News Agency. It claimed responsibility for Stride's and Eddowes's murders, and described the killing of the two women as the \\"double event\\", a designation which has endured.Evans and Skinner, p. 30; Rumbelow, p. 118 It has been argued that the postcard was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime,e.g. Cullen, Tom (1965), Autumn of Terror, London: The Bodley Head, p. 103 but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area.Cook, pp. 79‚Äì80; Fido, pp. 8‚Äì9; Marriott, pp. 219‚Äì222; Rumbelow, p. 123 Police officials later claimed to have identified a journalist as the author of the postcard,Cook, pp. 94‚Äì95; Evans and Skinner, pp. 624‚Äì633; Marriott, pp. 219‚Äì222; Rumbelow, pp. 121‚Äì122 and dismissed it as a hoax,e.g. Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, 10 October 1888, Metropolitan Police Archive MEPO 1/48, quoted in Cook, p. 78; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 140 and Evans and Skinner, p. 43 an assessment shared by most Ripper historians.e.g. \\"the majority view of the Ripper historians, myself included, is that all the Ripper correspondence was fake.\\" Beadle, William (2009) Jack the Ripper: Unmasked, London: John Blake, , p. 168 On 16 October 1888 a parcel containing half a human kidney accompanied by a note was received by George Lusk, Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. The note has become known as the \\"Lusk letter\\" or the \\"From hell\\" letter, because of the phrase \\"from hell\\" used by the writer, who claimed to have \\"fried and ate\\" the missing kidney half.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 167‚Äì168 The handwriting and style were unlike that of the \\"Saucy Jacky\\" postcard. The kidney was taken to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. He believed that the kidney was human, from the left side, and preserved in spirits.Fido, p. 78 The Daily Telegraph reported on 19 October that he said it was a recent \\"ginny kidney\\" from a 45-year-old female, but in the Star newspaper the same day Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it was impossible to detect the age or gender of the individual whom the kidney had belonged to,Cook, p. 146; Fido, p. 78 or how long it had been preserved in spirits. Major Henry Smith claimed in his memoirs that the sent kidney matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of Bright's disease. Smith's later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records.Cook, pp. 147‚Äì148; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Fido, pp. 78‚Äì79 Police surgeon Dr Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent.Cook, p. 148; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evans and Skinner, p. 189 Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evans and Skinner, p. 187; Fido, pp. 78‚Äì79 Smith's account is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part, and the kidney could have been a medical student's prank.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Fido, pp. 78‚Äì79 Dr Saunders, who attended the post-mortem, told the press, \\"the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy ... my opinion is that it was a student's antic.\\"Manchester Evening News, 19 October 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 168; Evening News, 20 October 1888, quoted in Fido, pp. 79‚Äì80 Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote: \\"similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter.\\"Home Office report quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 170 and Fido, p. 79 DNA analysis In 2014, mitochondrial DNA that matched that of one of Eddowes's descendants was extracted from a shawl said to have come from the scene of her murder. The DNA match was based on one of seven small segments taken from the hypervariable regions.Edwards, kindle locations 2442‚Äì2485 The segment contained a sequence variation described as 314.1C, and claimed to be uncommon, with a frequency of only 1 in 290,000 worldwide. However, Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys and others pointed out this was in fact an error in nomenclature for the common sequence variation 315.1C, which is present in more than 99% of the sequences in the EMPOP database. Other DNA on the shawl matched DNA from a relation of Aaron Kosminski, one of the suspects.

He is the eldest grandchild of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. Casiraghi is currently fourth in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne, following his twin cousins and his mother. Family background and early life Casiraghi was born on 8 June 1984 at the Princess Grace Hospital Centre in La Colle, Monaco, to Princess Caroline of Monaco and her husband, the Italian businessman and athlete Stefano Casiraghi. The eldest grandchild of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and his wife, former American actress Grace Kelly, Casiraghi was named after his father's childhood friend, his maternal uncle Prince Albert and his maternal great-grandfather Prince Pierre, Duke of Valentinois. Casiraghi's godparents are his maternal aunt Princess St√©phanie and his paternal uncle, Marco Casiraghi. His sister Charlotte was born on 3 August 1986, and his brother Pierre on 5 September 1987. On 3 October 1990, Casiraghi's father died in a speedboat accident in Monaco. He was buried several days later in Monaco's Chapel of Peace. Princess Caroline did not know how to tell her children that their father had died, so her father, Prince Rainier, did so. Andrea reportedly suffered nightmares and insomnia after his father's death. To protect her children from excessive media attention, Caroline moved to Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, and later to Paris. In 1999, his mother married Ernst August, Prince of Hanover, and gave birth to Princess Alexandra of Hanover. Along with a half-sister, Casiraghi gained two stepbrothers, Ernst August, Hereditary Prince of Hanover, and Prince Christian of Hanover. Education and career Growing up mostly in France, Casiraghi earned his international baccalaureate from the International School of Paris in December 2002. Following a period at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he eventually graduated in 2006 with a B.A. degree in visual arts and international politics from the American University of Paris. He was an intern at the Monegasque embassy to Qatar which, like most of Monaco's embassies, is based in Paris. In 2014, he started a Master of Business Administration at IE Business School (formerly known as Instituto de Empresa) in Madrid.  Philanthropy and social activities  Since 2004, Casiraghi has been involved, to varying degrees, with the World Association of Children's Friends (AMADE), a philanthropic organization founded in 1963 by his grandmother Grace; it is now presided over by his mother Princess Caroline. He spent eight months teaching children in Senegal, Togo, and Niger. In August 2006, Casiraghi took his involvement deeper and paid a very serious visit to Manila on behalf of a joint venture of AMADE and the Virlanie Foundation. Since 2007, he has been the patron of the Motrice Foundation, which funds research into cerebral palsy. Casiraghi sponsored the Hospices de Beaune charity auction that was held in November 2009. \\"In 2011, Andrea bought a pair of loafers from a Tod's boutique in Milan. This shopping trip was well publicized for a reason. The following summer, he donated them to the Small Steps Project.\\" The Small Steps Project gives celebrity-worn shoes to the poorest children in the world. Casiraghi regularly attends important social events in Monaco related to the Monegasque Princely Family, such as National Day, the Rose Ball, and the Formula One competition Monaco Grand Prix. In 2011, Casiraghi and his siblings Charlotte and Pierre hosted Monaco's annual Rose Ball, in the absence of Prince Albert, Princess Caroline and Princess St√©phanie who were mourning the sudden death of their aunt Princess Antoinette, Baroness of Massy, a few days earlier. Casiraghi gave the speech at the start of the event. The same year, he attended the wedding of his uncle Prince Albert and Charlene Wittstock, which took place on 1 and 2 July 2011. Personal and family life In July 2012, Princess Caroline released a statement announcing that her son Andrea Casiraghi and Tatiana Santo Domingo became engaged after a seven‚Äìyear relationship. Prior to their wedding, she had already accompanied Casiraghi at some of most important social events in Monaco, such as the Rose Ball, the enthronement of Prince Albert II, the Monaco Grand Prix and the wedding of Prince Albert and Charlene Wittstock. On 6 November 2012, his fianc√©e Tatiana Santo Domingo announced to La Voz Libre that she was expecting a baby. She gave birth to a boy, a son named Alexandre Andrea StefanoBunte p. 31, 10 October 2013. \\"Sasha\\" Casiraghi, on 21 March 2013, at Portland Hospital in London, England. As his parents were not married at the time of birth, he was not then included in the Monegasque line of succession. However, due to their subsequent marriage their son currently occupies the fifth position in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne. Casiraghi and Santo Domingo were married in a civil ceremony in the Princely Palace of Monaco on 31 August 2013. A religious ceremony was later held in Gstaad, Switzerland, on 1 February 2014. Their second child, a daughter named India, was born in London on 12 April 2015. Casiraghi is fluent in French, Italian, English and German as well. His hobbies and interests include reading, football, horse riding, water sports, skiing and collecting Swatch watches. In September 2017, Casiraghi and Santo Domingo enrolled their son in a pre-preparatory school in Kensington. In November 2017, there was speculation they were expecting their third child, later confirmed. Their third child, a boy named Maximilian Rainier, was born in London on 19 April 2018. Media In December 2011, Casiraghi had his driving licence taken away after he had been caught speeding at 200 km/h near Lyon, France. Casiraghi is regularly tracked by the tabloids and paparazzi. The media nicknamed him as \\"enfant terrible\\" and the \\"rebel angel\\". In 1999, he was included in the People Magazines \\"50 Most Beautiful People\\" list. In 2003, he was featured in a Town & Country article about young royals and was voted the most stylish male royal by Hello Magazines readers. In 2008, Forbes placed him the tenth on their \\"20 Hottest Young Royals\\" list.

(, ), and the Theotokos of Vladimir (), is a 12th-century Byzantine icon depicting the Virgin and Child and an early example of the Eleusa iconographic type. It is one of the most culturally significant and celebrated pieces of art in Russian history. Many consider it a national palladium with several miracles of historical importance to Russia being attributed to the icon. Following its near destruction in the thirteenth century, the work has been restored at least five times. The icon was painted by an unknown artist most likely in Constantinople. It was sent to Kiev as a gift before being transferred to the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir. It is traditionally said that the icon did not leave the city until 1395, when it was brought to Moscow to protect the city from an invasion by Timur, although the historical accuracy of this claim is uncertain. By at least the sixteenth century, it was in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow where it remained until it was moved to the State Tretyakov Gallery after the Russian Revolution. It was subject to an ownership dispute in the 1990s between the gallery and Moscow Patriarchate, which ended with its relocation to the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi. An arrangement was made to operate the church with dual status as a house church and part of the museum. The icon remains there today and is only accessible via an underground passage from the gallery to the church, where liturgies are still held.  History  = Origins = The surviving portion of the The icon is dated to the earlier part of the 12th century, and arrived in Russia around 1131. This is consistent with the account given in the Russian Chronicles..... Similar to other high quality Byzantine works of art, it is thought to have been painted in Constantinople... Only the faces are original, with the clothes repainted after suffering damage when a metal cover or riza was placed over them and in a fire in 1195. In about 1131, the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople sent the icon as a gift to Grand Duke Yuri Dolgorukiy of Kiev... Academic Sona Hoisington attributes this in part to a greater effort by Byzantines to convert and Christianize the Slavic peoples at the time.. It was kept in a Vyshgorod nunnery until Yuri's son, Andrey of Bogolyubovo, brought it to Vladimir in 1155. In a traditional account the horses transporting the icon had stopped near Vladimir and refused to go further. Accordingly, many Russians interpreted this as a sign that the Theotokos wanted the icon to stay there. The place was named Bogolyubovo, or \\"the one loved by God\\". Andrey placed it in his Bogolyubovo residence and built the Assumption Cathedral to legitimize his claim that Vladimir had replaced Kiev as Russia's principal city.. The icon was soon moved to the Assumption Cathedral after its consecration in 1160.. Prince Andrew removing the icon from a convent in Vyshgorod. A miniature from the Illustrated Chronicle of Ivan the Terrible Following the consecration of the Assumption Cathedral, which was soon followed by other churches dedicated to the Virgin, there is no record of the icon ever leaving Vladimir until 1395. However, its presence did not prevent the sack and burning of the city by the Mongols in 1238, when the icon was damaged in the fire. It was restored soon after the event, and again in 1431 and in 1512.. = Transfer to Moscow = Cyprian and Vasily I welcoming the Vladimir icon in Moscow A legend formed that the icon was painted by Luke the Evangelist from life; the first written account of this story dates back to 1512.. The intercession of the Theotokos through the image has also been credited with saving Moscow from Tatar hordes in 1451 and 1480. The image was brought from Vladimir to Moscow in 1395, during Tamerlane's invasion. The site where the Muscovites met the Vladimir delegation is commemorated by the Sretensky Monastery which is considered to be built where it occurred. However, no archeological evidence supports this claim, and much of the fifteenth-to-sixteenth century church was destroyed after renovations by the Russian Orthodox Church.. Vasily I of Moscow spent a night crying over the icon, and Tamerlane's armies retreated the same day. The Muscovites refused to return the icon to Vladimir and placed it in the Dormition Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin.. David Miller suggests that the icon was in fact normally still in Vladimir, with some excursions to Moscow, until the 1520s. Crediting the icon with saving Moscow in 1395 does not appear in sources until the late 15th century and the full version of the story until accounts of 1512 and then the 1560s.. There is less doubt that, by at least the 16th century, the Vladimirskaya was a thing of legend and associated with the growth of Russian national consciousness based on the Muscovite state.. = Post-revolution = Under the Bolsheviks, the icon came into the possession of the State Tretyakov Gallery.. Displayed as a work of art, it was first put on display in the gallery in 1930 and kept there for at least the next 11 years.. During the Battle of Moscow, Joseph Stalin allegedly had the icon flown around the city as the Germans began to invade.. This was first described by Moscow city official Viktor Volokhov in his book '. In 1993, it was moved to the Epiphany Cathedral for a Divine Liturgy in the wake of tensions between President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian Duma. Though it was damaged during the excursion, it was soon restored and given to the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi...  Description  The icon is a tempera painting on wood, in size, with the central portion being original and the rest being a later expansion undertaken possibly to accommodate a larger riza. The icon depicts Jesus Christ as a child being held in the arms of his mother, Mary. They embrace cheek to cheek, with the child gazing towards and reaching for Mary. She holds him with one arm and solemnly looks out towards the viewer. The faces and hands are painted with greenish olive sankir, a mix of ochre pigment and soot, and transparent layers of brighter ochre; the child's face is rendered in a lighter shade than the mother's, perhaps to reflect the difference in their age. The child's clothes are painted with dark ochre and gold. The original painting bore the inscription ŒúŒ° ŒòŒ•, an abbreviation for 'Mother of God', of which only parts survive.. In its nine centuries of existence, the icon has been restored and overpainted at least five times to deal with damage and deterioration, including a fifteenth century restoration thought to have been led by Andrei Rublev. It is mainly the faces of Mary and Jesus and the gold background above her head that are original twelfth-century paint. In the past, the icon has been covered with several elaborately designed oklad and riza (revetments) which caused damage to the frame. The reverse, which is much less well known, contains an image of the Hetoimasia ('prepared throne') and instruments of Christ's Passion that was painted in ca. 14th century (prior to that the reverse side had a painting of an unidentified saint)... Among icons of Virgin Mary with Jesus, Our lady of Vladimir is classed as an Eleusa icon (Russian: Oumilenie), due to the tender attachment between mother and child.. Theologians and believers have also commented upon the icons symbology and the religious sentiments it inspires. Contemplating the icon, theologian Henri Nouwen, remarked that the Virgin's eyes glance at neither the child or the viewer but appear to \\"look inward and outward at once\\"; that her free hand gestures towards the baby to \\"open a space for us to approach Jesus without fear\\"; and, that the child is shown as \\"a wise man dressed in adult clothes.\\". Literary scholar, S. S. Averintsev interpreted the mix of maternal tenderness and poignant sorrow seen in Mary's expression, as representative of the emotions generated by the events of Nativity and Calvary, respectively. Jesus's bare feet are seen as symbolizing his physical reality; his garments of gold, the Kingdom of Heaven; and the three stars on Mary's dress (one occluded by the child), \\"her virginity before, during and after her son‚Äôs birth.\\". Its artistic quality has been highly praised. Art historian David Talbot Rice said that \\"[Our Lady of Vladimir] ...is admitted by all who have seen it to be one of the most outstanding religious paintings of the world.\\" Art historian George Heard Hamilton praises its \\"craftsmanship and conception\\", and notes how in its representation of the subject's faces, the icon subtly transitions from its normal use of contour lines to a refined surface texture. It is painted in an artistic style typical for Byzantine art of the period with features including smaller mouths, refined eyes, and elongating Mary's nose. However, by avoiding the use of demarcating line, as became common in later Byzantine art, and by setting up the complex interplay of the mother and child's glances, the icon adds to the illusion of life in the piece. The child's features are reminiscent of classical sculpture, though the artist renders an expression truer to an actual infant's. The expressive and humanistic character of the icon differentiates it from earlier Byzantine art and exemplify the artistic developments seen during the Komnenos dynasty.  Significance  = In Russian history = The icon is generally considered to be one of the most cherished symbols in Russian history.. Academic David Miller has ascribed this to its close connection to Russian national consciousness throughout its existence.. Its transfer from Kiev to Vladimir was used by Bogolyubsky to legitimize Vladimir's claim as the new center of government in the Rus'. Additionally, its intimate association with important Russian historical events gave Our Lady of Vladimir the distinction of being a national palladium. The most recent of these events being the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis when it was brought to the Epiphany Cathedral at the request of Patriarch Alexy II and Mayor of Moscow Yury Luzhkov in their attempt to bring peace to the country. = As a religious icon = Our Lady of Vladimir's veneration is also likely enhanced by the fact that the Theotokos is regarded as the holy protectress of Russia. The venerated image has been used in celebration of coronations of tsars, elections of patriarchs, and other important ceremonies of state.. The icon has three feast days held throughout the year in celebration to specific events it is associated with: * to celebrate Moscow's protection from Crimean Khan Mehmed Giray in 1521. * for, in 1480, for their victory against Khan Ahmed during the Great Stand on the Ugra River. * to commemorate the Muscovite deliverance from pending invasion by Tamerlane..  Location and display  Our Lady of Vladimir on display within the church Our Lady of Vladimir is on display at the Church of St. Nicholas in Tolmachi... As a result of an agreement between the Tretyakov and Moscow Patriarchate, the church is both an active Russian Orthodox house church and functioning museum. Previously, it there had been a contentious ownership dispute between the two... In 1997, the Tretyakov completed a full restoration of the church. Security improvements to store and display art were added, and an underground passageway was additionally made to connect it to the State Tretyakov Gallery.. In order to house the famous icon, a temperature controlled bulletproof glass case was commissioned.. On 7 September 1996, Our Lady of Vladimir was first installed in the special case located within the church, and the next day Patriarch Alexy II consecrated the church. According to Archpriest Nikolai Sokolov, the rector for the church, the case would able to withstand the firing of a Kalashnikov rifle as well as many other potential hazards.. Due to its dual status as both church and museum, visitors are allowed to pray before the icon and divine Liturgies are regularly held on selected days. However, visitors can only enter the church through the Tretyakov Gallery and via the underground passageway.  Copies and influence  Even more than most, the original icon has been repeatedly duplicated for centuries, and many copies also have considerable artistic and religious significance of their own.. According to Suzanne Massie, it became a standard for many Russian contemporary depictions of Mary.. In preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics, a chapel was constructed for athletes to be able to pray before competition which hosted a copy of the icon.

(n√©e White; 10 May 1849 ‚Äì 7 August 1888) was an English prostitute killed in a spate of violent murders in Whitechapel, in the East End of London. She may have been the first victim of the still-unidentified Jack the Ripper. Although not one of the canonical five Ripper victims that historians have broadly acknowledged, she is considered the next most likely candidate. Early life Tabram was born Martha White in Southwark, London, on 10 May 1849.Jack the Ripper: The Facts p. 34 She was the youngest of five children born to Charles Samuel White, a warehouseman, and his wife, Elisabeth Dowsett. Her older siblings (in order of birth) included Henry White, Stephen White, Esther White and Mary Ann White. She was 5 feet 3 inches tall and had dark hair.Evans and Skinner, pp. 9, 18 In May 1865, her parents separated; six months later her father died suddenly. Later she went to live with Henry Samuel Tabram, a foreman packer at a furniture warehouse. The two married on 25 December 1869. In 1871 the couple moved to a house close to Martha's childhood home. She and Henry had two sons: Frederick John Tabram (born February 1871) and Charles Henry Tabram (born December 1872). The marriage was troubled, due to Martha's drinking, which was heavy enough to cause alcoholic fits, and her husband left her in 1875. For about three years he paid her an allowance of 12 shillings a week, then reduced this to two shillings and sixpence when he heard she was living with another man.Evans and Skinner, pp. 18‚Äì19 Tabram lived on and off with Henry Turner, a carpenter, from about 1876 until three weeks before her death. This relationship was also troubled by Martha's drinking and occasionally staying out all night. She, and her sons, were listed as being overnight inmates at the Whitechapel Union workhouse's casual ward at Thomas Street on the census night of 1881. By 1888 Turner was out of regular employment and the couple earned income by selling trinkets and other small articles on the streets, while lodging for about four months at 4 Star Place, off Commercial Road in Whitechapel. Around the beginning of July they left abruptly, owing rent, and separated for the last time about the middle of that month.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 53 Tabram moved to a common lodging house at 19 George Street, Spitalfields.Evans and Skinner, p. 11 6 August 1888 George Yard. The body of Martha Tabram was discovered at this location on 7 August 1888 On 6 August 1888, the night before her murder, Tabram was drinking ale and rum with another prostitute, Mary Ann Connelly, known as \\"Pearly Poll\\", and two soldiers in a public house, the Angel and Crown, close to George Yard Buildings. The four of them paired off, left the public house and separated at approximately 11:45 p.m.; each woman with her own client. Martha and her client went to George Yard,Evans and Rumbelow, p. 53; Fido, p. 16; Marriott, p. 11 a narrow north-south alley connecting Wentworth Street and Whitechapel High Street, entered from Whitechapel High Street by a covered archway next to The White Hart Inn. George Yard Buildings were on the eastern side of the alley, near the northern end to the back of Toynbee Hall. The Buildings were a former weaving factory that had been converted into tenements.Fido, p. 17 Pearly Poll and her client went to the parallel Angel Alley. Contemporary illustration of the discovery of the body of Martha Tabram =Murder= In the early hours of the following morning, a resident of the Buildings, one Mrs. Hewitt, was awoken by cries of \\"Murder!\\", but domestic violence and shouts of that nature were common in the area and she ignored the noise. At 2:00 a.m., two other residents, husband and wife Joseph and Elizabeth Mahoney, returned to the Buildings and saw no one on the stairs. At the same time, the patrolling beat officer, PC Thomas Barrett, questioned a grenadier loitering nearby, who replied that he was waiting for a friend.Evans and Skinner, pp. 16‚Äì17 At 3:30 a.m., resident Albert George Crow returned home after a night's work as a cab driver and noticed Tabram's body lying on a landing above the first flight of stairs. The landing was so dimly lit that he mistook her for a sleeping vagrant and it was not until just before 5:00 a.m. that a resident coming down the stairs on his way to work, dock labourer John Saunders Reeves, realised she was dead.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 51‚Äì52; Fido, p. 17 Reeves fetched Barrett, who sent for Dr. Timothy Robert Killeen to examine the body. Killeen arrived at about 5:30 a.m. and estimated that Tabram had been dead for around 3 hours.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 51 Her killer had stabbed her 39 times in the body and neck, including nine times in the throat, five in the left lung, two in the right lung, one in the heart, five in the liver, two in the spleen, and six in the stomach, also wounding her lower abdomen and genitals. She was lying on her back and her clothing was raised to her middle, exposing her lower half, which indicated the body lay in a sexual position. Killeen, however, could supply no evidence of intercourse. The testimony of the residents and Dr Killeen indicated that Tabram was killed between 2:00 a.m. and 3:30 a.m. Residents had seen and heard nothing amiss between these times. Investigation The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police Force, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, was in charge of the investigation. He arranged for PC Barrett to visit the Tower of London on 7 August in the hope that Barrett could identify the man he had seen standing in the street. Barrett did not recognise any of the men. A parade of all the soldiers on leave on the night of the murder was arranged at the Tower on 8 August, and this time PC Barrett picked out a man. On being asked to re- examine his choice, Barrett picked out another man, and the first was allowed to leave. Barrett explained his change of heart by stating that the man he had seen in George Yard had no medals, whereas the man he had selected at first did. Barrett's second choice, John Leary, claimed that on the night of the murder he had gone drinking in Brixton with a buddy, Private Law. According to Leary, they had missed each other at closing time and he had gone for a walk before meeting up with Law in the Strand at about 4:30 a.m., whereupon they had another drink in Billingsgate before returning to the Tower. Law was interviewed, separately from Leary, and his version of the night's events corresponded exactly with Leary's. On the strength of their corroborating statements and because of Barrett's uncertain identification, Leary and Law were dismissed from the inquiry.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 54; Evans and Skinner, pp. 13‚Äì14 Another soldier from the Tower, Corporal Benjamin, who was absent without leave, was also dismissed from the investigation after it transpired that he had been visiting his father in Kingston-upon-Thames.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 54; Evans and Skinner, pp. 11, 17 Connelly was not wholly cooperative with police and hid with a cousin for a while near Drury Lane,Evans and Rumbelow, p. 55; Fido, p. 18 not coming forward until 9 August.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 52 She missed an identity parade arranged at the Tower for 10 August, but attended the rescheduled one on the 13th.Evans and Skinner, p. 15 Connelly failed to recognise the clients and claimed that the men that night had worn white cap-bands. As such bands were only worn by the Coldstream Guards, rather than the Grenadier Guards at the Tower, Connelly was taken to another identity parade at Wellington Barracks on the 15th, where she picked out two soldiers, but both had solid alibis.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 54; Evans and Skinner, pp. 15‚Äì17; Fido, p. 18 One had been at home with his wife, while the other had been in the barracks.Evans and Skinner, pp. 15‚Äì18; Marriott, p. 12 Illustrated Police News sketch of the discovery of the body of Martha Tabram in George Yard Tabram's body was formally identified on 14 August by her estranged husband. At the time of her death she was wearing a black bonnet, a long black jacket, a dark green skirt, a brown petticoat and stockings, and spring-sided boots showing considerable wear. She was 5 feet 3 inches tall and had dark hair. The inquest into her death was concluded by deputy coroner for South East Middlesex George Collier on 23 August at the Working Lad's Institute, Whitechapel Road, with a verdict of murder by person or persons unknown. No suspect was ever arrested for Tabram's murder.Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 54‚Äì55 Jack the Ripper Contemporary newspaper reports published at the beginning of September linked Tabram's murder to those of Emma Elizabeth Smith on 3 April and Mary Ann Nichols on 31 August, though before she died, Smith had told the police that a gang had attacked her. The later killings of Annie Chapman on 8 September, of both Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes on 30 September and of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November were also linked at the time to Tabram's. The last five murders mentioned are now generally referred to as the \\"canonical five\\" victims of Jack the Ripper. All were knife murders of impoverished prostitutes in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts, generally perpetrated in darkness in the small hours of the morning, in a secluded site to which the public could gain access, and which occurred on or close to a weekend or holiday. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect her death with the later five murders.In an interview reported in the Pall Mall Gazette, 24 March 1903, Inspector Frederick Abberline referred to \\"George-yard, Whitechapel-road, where the first murder was committed\\" (quoted in Begg, p. 56). Walter Dew wrote in his memoirs, that \\"there can be no doubt that the August Bank Holiday murder ... was the handiwork of the Ripper\\" (I Caught Crippen, p. 97, quoted in Begg, p. 56). In his memoirs, Assistant Commissioner Robert Anderson said the second murder occurred on 31 August (quoted in Evans and Skinner, p. 632). Later students of the Ripper murders have largely excluded Tabram from the list of Ripper victims, chiefly because her throat was not cut in the manner of later victims, nor was she eviscerated.Marriott, p. 13 This view was advanced by Sir Melville Macnaghten, Assistant Chief Constable of the Metropolitan Police Service Criminal Investigation Department, who implied that Tabram was murdered by an unidentified soldier or soldiers in an 1894 memorandum on the murders.Fido, p. 152 Dr Killeen, who performed the post mortem on Tabram, strengthened this belief with his opinion that two weapons were used‚Äîone of Tabram's wounds, which penetrated the chest bone, was inflicted with a weapon longer and stouter than the others, a dagger or possibly a bayonet, while the others were inflicted with a shorter, slimmer knife.Cook, p. 218 Several 20th century psychological reports have assumed Mary Ann Nichols to have been Jack the Ripper's first victim, but add that her murder was unlikely to have been his first attack. Some have suggested the Ripper may have murdered Tabram before perfecting his modus operandi of overpowering and cutting the throats of his victims.Eddleston, p. 12 Other researchers, however, such as Philip Sugden in The Complete History of Jack the Ripper (), and Sean Day in Peter Underwood's Jack the Ripper: One Hundred Years of Mystery (), do view Tabram as a probable Ripper victim. Sir Melville Macnaghten was only actively involved in the Whitechapel murders investigation between 1889 and 1891; thus, his notes reflect only the opinions of some police officers at the time, and include several factual errors in the information presented pertaining to possible suspects. Serial killers have been known to have changed their murder weapons, but especially to develop their modus operandi over time, as the Ripper did with increasingly severe mutilations. While the five canonical Ripper murders were located roughly to north, south, east and west of Whitechapel, Tabram's murder occurred close to their geographic centre. It is possible that her murder was one of the first committed by the Ripper, before he had chosen his later modus operandi. In 1998 an Australian researcher, Ted Linn, produced his findings in a booklet called The Case of the Redhanded Copycat, in which he outlines his case that Martha's husband, Henry Samuel Tabram, was the real Ripper. He bases this on cryptographic clues he claims to have found in letters written by the Ripper, and other evidence.Robert Hefner, \\"Victim's husband 'the real Ripper'\\", Sunday Times, 15 March 1998, p. 1Hefner, \\"Cracking the Ripper's code\\", Sunday Times, 15 March 1998, p. 19 See also * Cold case * List of serial killers before 1900 * Unsolved murders in the United Kingdom Notes References =Bibliography= *Begg, Paul (2003).

Concord Repatriation General Hospital (abbreviated CRGH), commonly referred to as simply Concord Hospital, is a major hospital in Sydney, Australia, located on Hospital Road in Concord. It is a teaching hospital of Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney, where it is referred to as Concord Clinical School, and a major facility in the Sydney Local Health District and the former Sydney South West Area Health Service. The NSW Statewide Severe Burn Injury Service and the Bernie Banton Centre, an asbestos diseases research institute, are located at CRGH. Parts of the television series All Saints were filmed at CRGH. History Prior to the Second World War, the Yaralla Estate on which the hospital is built belonged to philanthropist Thomas Walker and subsequently his daughter Dame Eadith Walker. A small hospital had already been established on the site, known as the Thomas Walker Convalescent Hospital. Following the death of Dame Eadith in 1937, the property was bequeathed to the Crown for development as a public hospital.Walker Trusts Act 1938 No. 31, as amended. State of New South Wales. The current hospital was commissioned in 1939 as a general hospital for the Australian Army and opened on 11 March 1941. When completed in 1942, the 2,000-bed Yaralla Military Hospital (113th Australian General Hospital [A.G.H.]) was the largest hospital in the Southern Hemisphere. The main hospital building (currently known as the Multi Building) was one of the tallest buildings in Sydney when completed and its design won architects Stephenson & Turner the Sulman Award in 1946. Following the war, the hospital became a repatriation hospital for returned servicemen under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government, with a change in name to Repatriation General Hospital, Concord (RGHC). In 1963, RGHC became a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney. Recognising the growing community need, the hospital began providing care for general community patients in 1974, including the opening of an emergency department in 1977. In 1993, the hospital was transferred to the Central Sydney Area Health Service of the New South Wales Department of Health as a public hospital and renamed to the current Concord Repatriation General Hospital. Memorials Although it is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the hospital retains a historical significance to the veterans community in New South Wales. A number of memorials maintain these links, including: *Australian Hospital Ship Centaur memorial, a stained-glass window adjacent to the main entrance of the hospital *Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway and memorial rose garden, forming the major part of the designated route for commuting to/from Rhodes railway station. *Anzac Day remembrance services Future During mid-2006, construction work commenced on a new mental health precinct at the northern end of the hospital grounds. On completion the Sydney South West Area Mental Health Service (SSWAHMS) will relocate the majority of its existing services from The Rozelle Hospital to the new facilities at CRGH.

It is a quaternary level teaching hospital with all major medical and surgical specialities onsite except for obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics. It has a catchment population of 1.6 million people with 1050 beds and 5,800 full- time equivalent staff. In 2005, the hospital received Magnet Recognition. The hospital is located on Ipswich Road in Woolloongabba, an inner-city suburb of Brisbane. History The hospital is built on the site of the 1883 Diamantina Orphanage, named after Diamantina Bowen, wife of the first Governor of Queensland. In 1901, it became Diamantina Hospital for Chronic Diseases. In 1943, it became the South Brisbane Auxiliary Hospital and then the South Brisbane Hospital in 1956. In 1959, it became the Princess Alexandra Hospital and was opened by and named after HRH Princess Alexandra, to mark the Centennial of Queensland. In 2000, a new building was opened to replace the ageing red-brick hospital complex built in the 1950s. Electronic health records It was the first hospital in Queensland to be fully digitised in 2016, a process led by Dr Stephen Ayre, a former general practitioner, who was then the executive director. Observations and vital signs from patient monitoring devices are automatically uploaded to patient records. All records are visible to all clinicians. Within a year this resulted in significant benefits: * 14% fewer drug administration and monitoring errors * 33% fewer drug dispensing and supply incidents, * 17% fewer emergency readmissions within 28 days of discharge, * drug costs per weighted activity unit came down by 14%, * 56% fewer stage 3 & 4 hospital-acquired pressure ulcers * healthcare associated infections down 37%. * early identification of deteriorating patients went up by 59%. Units Queensland's spinal injuries unit and the liver and kidney transplantation services are based at the hospital. The Cardiothoracic Surgery Unit opened in 1998. In the following years the unit performed more than 10,000 operations. =Emergency department expansion= From 2009 to 2011 major expansion works were undertaken, including the doubling in size of the emergency department, the construction of a helipad with express elevators, and new oncology bunkers for cancer treatment. Centres The P.A. Foundation is located at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. The foundation raises money for medical research on the P.A. hospital campus. In April 2008, the Diamantina Institute for Cancer, Immunology and Metabolic Medicine was opened at the hospital. In July 2011, the Diamantina Health Partners, Queensland's first academic health science centre, was opened. The Diamantina Health Partners head office is located within the Translational Research Institute on the P.A. hospital campus. In mid-2014, the Diamantina Health Partners joined together with the Mayne Health Science Alliance and Children's Health Queensland to form the Brisbane Diamantina Health Partners Academic Health Science System, also housed within the Translational Research Institute on the Princess Alexandra Hospital campus. Transport The PA Hospital can be accessed by the dedicated PA Hospital busway station, the Dutton Park Railway Station and by buses on Ipswich Road or Cornwall Street. A taxi rank is also located on Ipswich Road. In March 2008 a new 1400 bay car park was opened to service visitors and staff parking needs.

It is the silicon analog of methylene, the simplest carbene. Silylene is a stable molecule as a gas but rapidly reacts in a bimolecular manner when condensed. Unlike carbenes, which can exist in the singlet or triplet state, silylene (and all of its derivatives) are singlets. Silylenes are formal derivatives of silylene with its hydrogens replaced by other substituents. Most examples feature amido (NR2) or alkyl/aryl groups. Silylenes have been proposed as reactive intermediates. They are carbene analogs. Synthesis and properties Silylenes are generally synthesized by thermolysis or photolysis of polysilanes, by silicon atom reactions (insertion, addition or abstraction), by pyrolysis of silanes, or by reduction of 1,1-dihalosilane. It has long been assumed that the conversion of metallic Si to tetravalent silicon compounds proceeds via silylene intermediates: :Si + Cl2 ‚Üí SiCl2 :SiCl2 \\\\+ Cl2 ‚Üí SiCl4 Similar considerations apply to the Direct process, i.e. the reaction of methyl chloride and bulk silicon.

Born in Leeds, Bellhouse received no formal education. An autodidact, he taught himself to read and write and the elements of arithmetic and technical drawing. In 1786, he moved to Manchester where he married Mary Wainwright and took up employment as a joiner with the building firm of Thomas Sharp. Sharp died in 1803 and his family had little appetite for the business so it was acquired by Bellhouse. During the Industrial Revolution there was a mass movement of workers towards Manchester to take up employment in the cotton spinning and textile industry. This created a demand for cheap housing and Bellhouse and his partners were among several tradesmen builders who made their fortunes in property speculation. From the early nineteenth century, Bellhouse expanded into the construction of complete factories and into work as a surveyor and valuer. His firm enjoyed the sole contracts for the erection of several public buildings, including the Portico Library, Islington Mill and the old Town Hall in King Street. Bellhouse was active in Manchester cultural life being a founder member of the Portico Library and the Royal Manchester Institution, now the Manchester Art Gallery. Bellhouse and his wife supported many social and charitable causes, especially for workers' education, and Bellhouse was one of the founders of the Manchester Mechanics' Institute (fore-runner of UMIST). In 1824, he was elected one of the Police Commissioners who comprised Manchester's local government, making use of the office in furthering his building enterprise. He held the post until 1832.

The present building dates from 1694‚Äì1697. The tower The Norwegian Royal Family and the Norwegian Government use the Cathedral for public events. It was closed for renovation in August 2006 and re-opened with a festive high mass on 18 April 2010. History The current Oslo Cathedral is the third cathedral in Oslo, Norway. The first, Hallvards Cathedral, was built by King Sigurd I of Norway in the first half of the 12th century, and was located by the Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo, some east of today's cathedral. For almost 500 years, Hallvards Cathedral was the most important church in the city. After a great fire in Oslo during 1624, King Christian IV decided to move the city a few kilometers west to be protected by Akershus Fortress. Construction of a new church was begun in 1632, on the main square in the new city. After that, Hallvards Cathedral fell into disrepair and decayed. In 1639 the second cathedral was built (Hellig Trefoldighet). This cathedral burnt down after only 50 years, however, and the current cathedral was built to replace it. The church was probably designed by J√∏rgen Wiggers, the Councillor of the State (etatsr√•d). The current cathedral was erected on a small rocky outcrop in the east end of what would later become Stortorvet. The foundation stone was laid in 1694 and the church was consecrated in November 1697. In August 2001, Oslo Cathedral was the site of the wedding of Prince Haakon, and Princess Mette-Marit Tjessem H√∏iby. Restoration Stained glass window The Cathedral was rebuilt between 1848-1850 after a plan by German-born architect, Alexis de Chateauneuf (1799-1853). Another German-born architect, Heinrich Ernst Schirmer (1814-1887) was the construction manager for the project. When Chateauneuf became ill in 1850, Schirmer retained Wilhelm von Hanno (1826-1882) to complete the project.Alexis de Chateauneuf(Store norske leksikon)Wilhelm Von Hanno (Store norske leksikon) Oslo Cathedral is located at Stortorvet square north/north-east of Karl Johans gate, between Kirke gate and Dronningens gate. The Cathedral's lower end is surrounded by the Bazaar (Basarene ved Oslo domkirke), a curved long building with a tower covered in green copper like the Cathedral. Integrated with Basarene is the Fire Watch (Brannvakten) which served as Oslo's main fire station from 1860 until 1939, when today's main fire station at Arne Garborgs plass was opened. The Cathedral, Basarene and Brannvakten are all built in red brick. Both Basarene and Brannvakten were built between the years 1840-1859 from the plans of City Architect, Christian H. Grosch. Art works from recent times in the cathedral include stained glass windows in the choir by Emanuel Vigeland installed between 1910‚Äì16, west portal's bronze doors executed by Dagfin Werenskiold (1892-1977) in 1938, and the silver sculpture with communion scene by Italian sculptor Arrigo Minerbi dating from 1930. The ceiling decorations are by Norwegian painter Hugo Lous Mohr (1889-1970). In the latter half of the 1990s, the main organ built by Ryde & Berg of Fredrikstad, was mounted behind the old baroque facade. Dagfin Werenskiold (Store norske leksikon) Hugo Lous Mohr (Store norske leksikon) Restoration was completed at the time of the city's 900 anniversary in 1950. The church was restored under the plans of architect Arnstein Arneberg. The neo-Gothic interior was removed and the original furnishings brought back. Arneberg also designed the chapel on the south side of the church. The church was closed in August 2006 for renovation and was opened in April 2010 in the presence of Harald V of Norway and the Norwegian royal family.Oslo domkirke (Store norske leksikon)Hello Magazine 19 April 2010 Bishops of Oslo since the Reformation Altar The Cathedral * 1541‚Äì1545 Hans Rev * 1545‚Äì1548 Anders Madss√∏n * 1548‚Äì1580 Frants Berg * 1580‚Äì1600 Jens Nilss√∏n * 1601‚Äì1607 Anders Bendss√∏n Dall * 1607‚Äì1617 Niels Clauss√∏n Senning * 1617‚Äì1639 Niels Simonsen Glostrup * 1639‚Äì1646 * 1646‚Äì1664 Henning Stockfleth * 1664‚Äì1699 Hans Rosing * 1699‚Äì1712 Hans Munch * 1713‚Äì1730 Bartholom√¶us Deichman * 1731‚Äì1737 Peder Hersleb * 1738‚Äì1758 Niels Dorph * 1758‚Äì1773 Frederik Nannestad * 1773‚Äì1804 Christen Schmidt * 1805‚Äì1822 Frederik Julius Bech * 1823‚Äì1845 Christian S√∏rensen * 1846‚Äì1874 Jens Lauritz Arup * 1875‚Äì1893 Carl Peter Parelius Essendrop * 1893‚Äì1896 * 1896‚Äì1912 Anton Christian Bang * 1912‚Äì1922 Jens Fr√∏lich Tandberg * 1922‚Äì1937 * 1937‚Äì1951 Eivind Berggrav * 1951‚Äì1968 Johannes Smemo * 1968‚Äì1973 Fridtjov S√∏iland Birkeli * 1973‚Äì1977 Kaare St√∏ylen * 1977‚Äì1998 Andreas Aarflot * 1998‚Äì2005 Gunnar St√•lsett * 2005‚Äì2017 Ole Christian Kvarme * 2017- Kari Veiteberg Organs and organists Interior ceiling The organ The cathedral's first organ was built in 1711 by Carl Gustav Luckvitz, while the current main organ was built by Jan Ryde in 1997 for the 300-year anniversary.

It was briefly named Hastings but renamed Madoc Township after the legendary Welsh prince Madoc ap Owain Gwynedd, credited by some with discovering North America in 1170. When people traveled by horse and carriage during the 19th century from Toronto to Ottawa, Madoc was the halfway stop over, allowing the passengers and horses to rest. The community separated from the namesake township and remained an incorporated municipality until 1998. The area has had a rich mining history. Gold was discovered at nearby Eldorado in 1866. Fluorite was extracted from the area during the 1930s and 1940s. The talc mine, under the name Canada Talc (Cantalc), that was in production in Madoc for almost 114 years by 2010 is now shutting down. It is one of only three mines in the world that has been in steady operation for more than one hundred years.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry- news/energy-and-resources/when-a-mine-closes/article1212744/ On January 25, 1998, the Village of Madoc amalgamated with Huntingdon Township to form Centre Hastings. Madoc is the largest community in the municipality. Its post office services locals with lock boxes and rural routes.https://www.canadapost.ca/cpotools/apps/fpo/personal/findPostOfficeDetail?outletId=0000312746 In 2008, Madoc celebrated its 130th anniversary. Attractions O'Hara Mill Homestead and Conservation Area features the O'Hara Sawmill. It is reputedly the only water-powered upright frame saw left in Ontario. It operated for more than 40 years and continued to operate for several years as a tourist attraction.http://www.madoc.ca/attractions.php The village has a premier skateboard park with splash pad, canteen, night-time lighting with bleachers and performing arts centre with music stage made from straw-bale construction.http://www.comfortcountry.ca/upload/file/Tours/Family%2520Recreation%2520Tour.pdf+&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=ca An outdoor public swimming pool is located at 65 Queen Victoria St. W. in Madoc.

Approaches Six streets converge here clockwise from north: *65-metre Harewood Place which links Oxford Street *Princes Street *Hanover Street *Saint George Street *Brook Street *pedestrianised Tenderden Street, linking via L-shaped Dering Street to (New) Bond Street and Oxford Street. History Hanover Square was developed shortly after the accession of the Elector of Hanover as King George I in 1714, which gave the square its name. Its land was turned over to building leases principally by Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough and a soldier and statesman best known for his role in the Glorious Revolution, to be prestigious homes. Coinciding with the century-long Whig Ascendancy its name echoes the staunch and predominant support among the wealthy of the Hanoverian succession of 1714, an exclusion of Catholic senior heirs from the throne, as a permanent law. \\"Early Hanover Square was decidedly Whig and most decidedly military\\", commented architectural historian Sir John Summerson. Early residents included Generals Earl Cadogan, Sir Charles Wills, Stewart, Evans, Lord Carpenter, The Marquis of Willesden Hamish Smith and John Pepper, \\"names conspicuously associated with episodes in Marlborough‚Äôs war and the 'Fifteen'.\\"Summerson, pp. 98‚Äì100.Walford, quoting Weekly Medley, 1717.

The station is on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan line and Piccadilly line, between Ruislip and Hillingdon stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 6. History Westbound platform looking east towards Ruislip The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line through Ickenham between Harrow on the Hill and Uxbridge and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, the only intermediate stop being at Ruislip. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905. Progressive development in the north Middlesex area over the next two decades led to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. On 25 September 1905 a small halt was opened as Ickenham Halt by the Metropolitan Railway, following lobbying by the Ickenham Parish Council. The railway company had been reluctant to open a station in the area due to a perceived lack of revenue and so a compromise was reached with the halt. The new halt brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Villagers living near the halt sold flowers from their gardens and served teas. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905. A booking hut followed in 1910. The platforms, which had been too short for trains to call at fully, were extended in 1922. On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane was opened, enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933 District line services were replaced by Piccadilly line trains. The station was rebuilt into its present form between 1970 and 1971 replacing the 'halt' structures dating from 1905. In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a ¬£200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

A free borabenzene, which has no donor ligand on the boron atom, has not yet been isolated despite its simple structure and the chemical robustness of boron-carbon bonds. The instability of this molecule results from the high Lewis acidity of the boron atom due to its electron deficiency. All attempts to create a free borabenzene have resulted in formations of complexes with anionic or neutral ligands (even a nitrogen molecule can coordinate to a borabenzene). However, the complexes with anionic ligands, called boratabenzenes, show rich chemistry including the coordination chemistry as anionic œÄ-type ligands. Borabenzene also forms stable adducts with electron donor molecules such as pyridine (the adduct with which is isoelectronic with biphenyl) or triphenylphosphine (the adduct with which is isoelectronic with tetraphenylsilane). Properties as ligands Boratabenzenes have a negative charge on their six-membered rings and act as strong œÄ-donating ligands like a cyclopentadienyl anion, which is often used in transition metal complexes. In fact, sandwich or half-sandwich type complexes of many transition metals have been reported using boratabenzenes, and the zirconium sandwich complexes exhibit catalytic activity in ethylene polymerization similar to zirconocenes, which are the cyclopentadienyl counterparts. Family of boratabenzenes Several boracyclic compounds are involved in the family of boratabenzenes: 1-boratanaphthalene, 9-borathaanthracene, boracyclooctatetraene, and 2,2‚Äô-diboratabiphenyl. Among these compounds, 2,2‚Äô-diboratabiphenyl is the first bidentate Lewis acid based on a borabenzene framework, so it is regarded as a Lewis acid analogue of 2,2‚Äô-bipyridine, a common bidentate ligand. This compound forms polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon analogues containing boron and nitrogen atoms, which show characteristic optical and electrochemical properties due to the charge transfer between the boron and nitrogen atoms. Reactions Borabenzene is known to react with electron-deficient alkynes in a Diels-Alder reaction to the boron pendants of barrelene called borabarrelenes:1-Borabarrelene Derivatives via Diels-Alder Additions to Borabenzenes Thomas K.

Lett.; 2006; 8(13) pp 2875 - 2878; (Letter) :Borabarrelene synthesis Likewise the benzoborabarrelene is accessible through reaction with benzyne through 2-(Trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflate and caesium fluoride: :benzoborabenzene synthesis The boron atom in these barrelene compounds is pyramidalized (the sum of the C-B-C angles is 311¬∞ not 327¬∞) leading to even greater Lewis acid strength. This is evident from the unusual small B-N bond length of 158 picometer compared to 165pm for ordinary B-N bonds in borane-pyridine adducts. Another remarkable manifestation of this property is their reluctance to surrender the pyridine ligand (for example in exchange for deuterated pyridine d5-Py), even at 200 ¬∞C. Unlike ordinary barrelenes, this benzobarrelene is also resistant to ring- opening metathesis polymerisation.

Born in Kiel, Germany, he studied at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin and in Vienna. He was heavily involved in creating three orchestras in his lifetime, most notably the Chamber Orchestra of the Saar. With this group he created one of the earliest recorded collections of Bach's orchestral music. These recordings were made between 1954 and 1967 as Les Discophiles Fran√ßais, Erato and Club Fran√ßais du Disque releases in France and appeared then under license with various American labels (notably Nonesuch) on both LP and cassette. Following an out- of-print period, in 2000 the French Accord label, Universal released a six-CD set comprising the entire set of Ristenpart recordings of Bach orchestral works. The conductor and his colleagues from Saarbr√ºcken have also recorded performances of works by Mozart and Haydn, among others. The lasting fame he received for these interpretations of Baroque and early Classical music overshadowed the fact that with his Saar orchestra he actually recorded works by approximately 230 composers, at least half of them belonging to the 20th century, for the Saar radio. A possible influence in this direction was Hermann Scherchen, with whom Ristenpart's mother was acquainted before 1914 and to whom she was married between 1919 and 1920. (Hermann Scherchen was a politically active conductor responsible for the premiere performances of what were at the time controversial pieces by composers such as Berg and Xenakis.) In 1932 Ristenpart became the conductor of a little string ensemble in Berlin, whose core was composed of women friends of his wife, the pianist and harpsichordist Ruth Christensen. This ensemble came to be known as the Karl Ristenpart Chamber Orchestra and often played for the Berlin radio and the Deutschlandsender, mostly for exhausting live night broadcasts abroad. But Ristenpart's career as a promising young conductor in Germany was hobbled by his refusal to join the Nazis. Following World War II, Ristenpart returned to devastated Berlin and put works by Gustav Mahler (his favorite composer) on the program of his first public concert in the Summer of 1945. With Berlin divided into several foreign sectors, his unblemished political record allowed him to be named conductor for the \\"Radio in the American Sector\\" of Berlin (RIAS). In 1946 he thus started to record music, from Monteverdi to Stravinsky, with the forces of his former Karl Ristenpart Chamber Orchestra, supplemented by vocal soloists and top musicians from other Berlin orchestras, under the label \\"RIAS-Choir and Chamber Orchestra\\". This constituted the second of his important periods of orchestra development and the beginning of his breakthrough to international fame as a conductor, which was mostly built on his ambitious J.S. Bach concert cycle from March 1947 to December 1952. From this period dates the legendary Archiv production featuring baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Hermann T√∂ttcher playing oboe and oboe da caccia in Bach's Cantatas Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen, BWV 56 and Ich habe genug, BWV 82. But the worsening of the post-war political situation in Germany in the early 1950s, particularly in Berlin where circulating between the various sectors became increasingly difficult, also created financial problems for radio broadcasting. When it became clear at the end of 1952 that the RIAS could not go on subsidizing all its orchestras, Ristenpart accepted an offer to create a new chamber orchestra for the Saar radio, with which he was also to produce LPs for Les Discophiles fran√ßais (an unusual arrangement linked to the fact that the \\"autonomous\\" Saar region was still under French administration at the time). Ristenpart began working in the Summer of 1953 as conductor of the Saar Chamber Orchestra, which, out of an initial 16, included 10 young musicians who had come along with him from Berlin. Among them were the Hendel Quartet, whose leader, Georg Friedrich Hendel, became the orchestra's first violin soloist. The ensuing collaboration with top French instrumental soloists was especially fruitful, leading to many tours, recordings and partnerships with soloists such as flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal and the members of his wind ensemble Le Quintette √† vent Fran√ßais. Some 170 LP-records featuring Ristenpart and his Saar Chamber Orchestra have been marketed under license by various record companies all over the world. These include two complete sets of the Brandenburg concertos, the Orchestral Suites and The Art of Fugue, several albums of Bach vocal cantatas, many Telemann, Vivaldi, many Mozart and Haydn works, but also award-winning records of Britten, Roussel and Hindemith pieces. In December 1967, Ristenpart suffered a heart attack while on tour in Portugal with the chamber orchestra of the Gulbenkian Foundation and died in a Lisbon hospital on Christmas Eve. The Chamber Orchestra of the Saar was unable to survive long the dimming of its guiding light. After four years under the baton of the reputable cellist Antonio Janigro, and the death in a car accident of its core musicians, first- violin Georg Friedrich Hendel and his wife Betty Hindrichs-Hendel, first- cellist, it merged with the Saarbr√ºcken Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1973.

He is especially noted for his tenures as music director of the Cleveland Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic in the 1930s and 1940s. Biography =Early years= Rodzi≈Ñski was born in Split, the capital of Dalmatia, on 1 January 1892. Soon afterward his father, of Polish descent and a general in the army of the Habsburg empire, returned with his family to Lw√≥w, Poland, where Artur studied music. He later studied law in Vienna, where he simultaneously enrolled at the Academy of Music; his teachers there included Josef Marx and Franz Schreker (composition), Franz Schalk (conducting), and Emil von Sauer and Jerzy Lalewicz (piano). He returned to Lw√≥w where he was engaged as chorus master at the Opera in that city, making his debut as a conductor in 1920 with Verdi's Ernani. The following year saw him conducting the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra and at the Warsaw Opera. While visiting Poland, Leopold Stokowski heard Rodzi≈Ñski leading a performance of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg and exclaimed, \\"I have found that rare thing, a born conductor!\\" and invited him to conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra. =Los Angeles and Cleveland= Between 1925 and 1929 he served as Stokowski's assistant, conducted for the Philadelphia Grand Opera and directed the opera and orchestral departments at the Curtis Institute of Music. From 1929 to 1933, Rodzi≈Ñski was the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Rodzi≈Ñski was named the second music director of The Cleveland Orchestra in 1933, following the departure of Nikolai Sokoloff. Although demanding, Rodzi≈Ñski propelled the Orchestra forward. He would frequently endear himself to the public by conducting without a music score or baton. One of his main contributions to Cleveland's music scene was integrating opera into The Cleveland Orchestra's repertoire. In addition, Rodzi≈Ñski sought to feature more contemporary music in Orchestra performances, including Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Alban Berg, Dmitri Shostakovich, Jerome Kern, and the first Cleveland performances of Stravinsky‚Äôs Le Sacre du Printemps. Under Rodzi≈Ñski‚Äôs leadership, the Orchestra presented the United States premiere of Shostakovich‚Äôs controversial opera, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, in 1935 ‚Äî only a year after its debut in the Soviet Union led to a condemnation of Shostakovich‚Äôs music by the Soviet press. In his quest to perform the U.S. premiere, Rodzinski was forced to compete with his mentor at the Philadelphia Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski. Although Rodzi≈Ñski worried about the Cleveland audience‚Äôs reception for the provocative opera, the Orchestra‚Äôs performances proved a success. Shostakovich himself had an abiding faith in the Rodzi≈Ñski- led performance: ‚ÄúWhen you see The Cleveland Orchestra‚Äôs presentation of the American premiere of my opera in Severance Hall the last day of January, you will see no traditional opera‚Ä¶I have repudiated all old forms of opera.‚Äù One of the most famous recordings made by the Orchestra during Rodzi≈Ñski's tenure was a performance of Kern's 1927 musical Show Boat. Arranged by the composer himself as Show Boat Scenario for Orchestra, the piece was recorded by the Orchestra in 1941 and conducted by Rodzi≈Ñski 38 times over a three-year period. Among the more memorable moments of Rodzi≈Ñski's career, he was on the podium as a guest conductor with the New York Philharmonic on December 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Although Rodzi≈Ñski declined to announce the news ‚Äî the concert was being broadcast live on the radio ‚Äî he led the Philharmonic in a performance of the Star-Spangled Banner. Later, he noted that the demands of World War II on young men should inspire orchestras to take the then-unprecedented step of adding women to their ranks. In his view, women would make ‚Äúan excellent addition to any first class symphony orchestra.‚Äù Between December 1939 and February 1942, Rodzi≈Ñski and The Cleveland Orchestra made an extensive series of recordings for Columbia Records. He also appeared with the New York Philharmonic in 1934 and 1937, receiving positive reviews for his concert performance of Richard Strauss's Elektra. In addition, Rodzi≈Ñski was active across Europe, becoming the first naturalized American citizen to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic at the Salzburg Festival in 1936 and 1937. At Arturo Toscanini's recommendation, Rodzi≈Ñski was asked by NBC to select musicians for the new NBC Symphony Orchestra. Later, he trained the orchestra, guided some of its first recordings (issued on the budget label World's Greatest Music with neither conductor nor orchestra identified), and led its concerts before Toscanini's arrival. This engagement inspired Rodzi≈Ñski to depart Cleveland for New York, where he became music director and conductor of the New York Philharmonic beginning in the 1943‚Äì44 season. =New York and Chicago= Rodzi≈Ñski was appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1943.Downes, Olin, \\"Rodzinski Comes to New York\\", New York Times, 3 January 1943. Although his four-year tenure was marked by struggles with Arthur Judson, the manager of the orchestra, Rodzi≈Ñski achieved high standards of performance. The renowned music critic and composer Virgil Thomson wrote about Rodzi≈Ñski's tenure at the Philharmonic: \\"We now have an orchestra that is a joy to hear...and we owe it all to Artur Rodzi≈Ñski.\\" During Rodzi≈Ñski's time on the podium the Philharmonic recorded extensively, again for Columbia, performed weekly live broadcasts on CBS Radio, and appeared in the feature film Carnegie Hall. However, despite the quality of the orchestra's performances, numerous artistic matters such as the prerogative of the music director to dismiss musicians, select soloists and determine repertoire were persistent grounds of contention. Not willing to compromise on these matters, Rodzi≈Ñski resigned in 1947. His reputation as a conductor was so prominent at this time that his resignation was the subject of a cover story in Time magazine in February 1947. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra had been wooing Rodzi≈Ñski for some time, and now he decided to accept the leadership of that orchestra immediately, starting with the 1947‚Äì1948 season. Here again, an inability to work with the board resulted in his swift departure after only one season. His short tenure still had a significant impact upon the orchestra and local audiences through performances such as an account of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde with Kirsten Flagstad. =Last years= After his departure from Chicago, Rodzi≈Ñski's health began to deteriorate. There was little recording activity available to him in the U.S., and so he settled in Europe once more. Here his status as a major musician was recognized and he was invited to lead significant productions, such as the 1953 first performance of Prokofiev's War and Peace at the Maggio Musicale in Florence, as well as traditional repertoire works. He conducted at La Scala and worked extensively for Italian radio, conducting well received readings of Wagner's Tannh√§user and Tristan, and Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov and Khovanshchina. He re-established his presence as a recording artist through a contract with Westminster Records, for whom he recorded extensively with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (under the pseudonym \\"Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of London\\") from 1955. His final recordings were for EMI in 1958. By this time, the state of Rodzi≈Ñski's health had become fragile. He was warned by his Italian doctor that further conducting activity would put his life at risk. However, he returned to Chicago in 1958 to conduct Tristan once again, this time with the Chicago Lyric Opera and soprano Birgit Nilsson. His return was a triumph, but these were his last performances and he died shortly afterwards. Family Rodzi≈Ñski was married twice and had two sons. In 1917 he married the concert pianist Mme. Ilse, and in 1918 they had a son, Witold, who became an historian, sinologist and diplomat. In 1934, while living in Cleveland, he married Halina Lilpop Wieniawski (1905-1993), who was from a well-known Warsaw family.Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, case.edu; accessed 13 September 2015. Their infant son Richard was the subject of Arnold Schoenberg's amusing canon \\"I am almost sure when your nurse will change your diapers.\\"Profile, schoenberg.at; accessed 13 September 2015. Richard served as artistic administrator at the San Francisco Opera and Metropolitan Opera companies in the 1960s and 1970s. He recently retired from his position as president of the Van Cliburn Foundation, and in 2009 became the General Director of the International Tchaikovsky Competition. In 1976 Halina Rodzi≈Ñski wrote the autobiography Our Two Lives, still the most extensive published account of Rodzi≈Ñski's life and career. Recordings Rodzi≈Ñski recorded for Columbia Records (with the Cleveland Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic); RCA Victor (with the Chicago Symphony); Westminster Records (the Royal Philharmonic); and EMI. A few of his later recordings were taped in stereo and have remained in circulation to this day. His complete recording of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker for Westminster was recorded in stereo in 1956. The stereo version was originally released on 2-track reel-to-reel audio tape. On LP it was initially released only in mono, then later in stereo as stereo record albums became available in 1958. The stereo Nutcracker was re-released in 2001 by Deutsche Grammophon on compact disc.

History The town was founded as Chiang Hung (Cheli), by Tai king Phanya Coeng in 1180. =Kingdom of Chiang Hung (Sipsongpanna)= During the Mongol Yuan Dynasty in China, the Tai kingdom of Sipsongpanna began a close and long-lasting relationship to Lanna, another historic Tai kingdom that lay south. In 1296, Lanna's capital Chiang Mai was founded by Mangrai, whose maternal grandfather was King Rung Kaen Chai () of Jinghong (i.e.: Sipsongpanna). The kingdoms of Sipsongpanna and Lanna maintained ties through migration and intermarriage. In 1401 during the Chinese Ming Dynasty, the Sipsongpanna Tai ruler Tau Se Da Xam (pinyin: Dao Xianda) attacked a smaller Tai area to the north unknown as Weiyuan equivalent to modern Jinggu). The Ming administration sought to retaliate but adopted a cautious response of diplomacy and Tau Se Da Xam withdrew his troops. About this period Sipsongpanna began to pay tribute to the Ming. In 1405 the Sipsongpanna Tai attacked Chiang Mai, in conjunction with Ming Chinese troops. In 1421 the Chinese attempted to cause a split in Sipsongpanna by backing multiple administrations during a period of civil strife, but their plan failed to succeed. 1448 saw the defeat of Mong Mao, a Tai state in eastern Burma, by a combination of Chinese, Sipsongpanna and allied forces united under the Ming. In the 1450s another struggle for succession arose in Sipsongpanna, with one faction backed by Kengtung and one by Chiang Mai. Despite the Kengtung faction's victory, conflict started with that state shortly afterwards. The Burmese Toungoo state arose in the 1530s to crush Chiang Mai, and its influence also extended to Kengtung and Sipsongpanna, which like other Tai kingdoms soon began to pay tribute. Geography and climate Looking west along the Mekong river in the evening from the new bridge, prior to the redevelopment of the waterfront. Jinghong has a latitude range of 21¬∞27'‚Äì22¬∞36' N and a longitude range of 100¬∞25'‚Äì101¬∞31' E. It borders Pu'er City to the north, Mengla County to the east and Menghai County to the west, as well as Burma's Shan State to the south. The city is limited to the south by Hengduan Mountains, and the Lancang River (Mekong) passes through Jinghong. Two bridges near the city span this river, which flows south-east towards Laos. Climatically, Jinghong contains elements of both a tropical wet and dry climate and a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Aw and Cwa, respectively). The city has a generally humid climate with strong monsoonal influences. Summer is long and there is virtually no \\"winter\\" as such; instead, there is a dry season (December thru April) and wet season (May thru October). Annual sunshine hours amount to between 1800 and 2300 and annual rainfall ranging from . The coolest month is December and January, averaging , while the warmest is June, at ; the annual mean is . However, high temperatures reach their peak in April before the onset of the monsoon from the Indian Ocean. Transport One of Jinghong's many palm-lined streets The main terminal of Jinghong Airport *Xishuangbanna Gasa Airport is the second largest airport in Yunnan, located just five kilometers from the downtown. Flights to Kunming, Shanghai, Chengdu and other major cities in China run regularly.

The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators or the ocean. Currently, only 9% of plastic is actually recycled. In a zero waste system, material will be reused until the optimum level of consumption. The definition adopted by the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) is: > Zero Waste: The conservation of all resources by means of responsible > production, consumption, reuse and recovery of all products, packaging, and > materials, without burning them, and without discharges to land, water or > air that threaten the environment or human health. Zero Waste refers to waste prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe waste management. It is a whole systems approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society, resulting in no waste. Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through recycling and reuse. It focuses on restructuring production and distribution systems to reduce waste. Zero waste is more of a goal or ideal rather than a hard target. Zero Waste provides guiding principles for continually working towards eliminating wastes. Advocates expect that government regulation is needed to influence industrial choices over product and packaging design, manufacturing processes, and material selection. Advocates say eliminating waste decreases pollution, and can also reduce costs due to the reduced need for raw materials.  Cradle-to-cradle / cradle-to-grave  The cradle-to-grave is a linear model for materials that begins with resource extraction, moves to product manufacturing, and ends by a \\"grave\\", where the product is disposed of in a landfill. Cradle-to-grave is in direct contrast to cradle-to-cradle materials or products, which are recycled into a products at the end of their lives, so that ultimately there is no waste. Cradle-to-cradle focuses on designing industrial systems so that materials flow in closed-loop cycles which mean that waste is minimized, and waste products can be recycled and reused. Cradle-to-cradle simply goes beyond dealing with issues of waste after it has been created, by addressing problems at the source and by re-defining problems by focusing on design. The cradle-to-cradle model is sustainable and considerate of life and future generations. The cradle-to-cradle framework has evolved steadily from theory to practice. In the industrial sector, it is creating a new notion of materials and material flows. Just as in the natural world, in which one organism's \\"waste\\", cycles through an ecosystem to provide nourishment for other living things, cradle-to-cradle materials circulate in closed-loop cycles, providing nutrients for nature or industry. An example of a closed loop, cradle-to-cradle product design is DesignTex Fabric. It has designed an upholstery fabric, Climatex Lifecycle, which is a blend of pesticide- and residue-free wool and organically grown ramie, dyed and processed entirely with nontoxic chemicals. The spread of industrialization worldwide has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production. In 2012 the World Bank stated that 1.3 billion tonnes of municipal waste was produced by urban populations and estimates that that number will reach 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025 (Global Solid Waste Management Market - Analysis and Forecast). The increase in solid waste production increases the need for landfills. With the increase in urbanization, these landfills are being placed closer to communities. These landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status with primarily non-white populations. Findings indicated these areas are often targeted as waste sites because permits are more easily acquired and there was generally less community resistance. Additionally, within the last five years, more than 400 hazardous waste facilities have received formal enforcement actions for unspecified violations that were considered to be a risk to human health. There is a growing global population that is faced with limited resources from the environment.[7] To relieve the pressures placed on the finite resources available it has become more important to prevent waste. To achieve zero waste, waste management has to move from a linear system to be more cyclical so that materials, products, and substances are used as efficiently as possible. Materials must be chosen so that it may either return safely to a cycle within the environment or remain viable in the industrial cycle.[8] Zero waste promotes not only reuse and recycling but, more importantly, it promotes prevention and product designs that consider the entire product life cycle.[8] Zero waste designs strive for reduced materials use, use of recycled materials, use of more benign materials, longer product lives, reparability, and ease of disassembly at end of life.[3] Zero waste strongly supports sustainability by protecting the environment, reducing costs and producing additional jobs in the management and handling of wastes back into the industrial cycle.[8] A Zero waste strategy may be applied to businesses, communities, industrial sectors, schools and homes. Benefits proposed by advocates include: * Saving money. Since waste is a sign of inefficiency, the reduction of waste can reduce costs. * Faster Progress. A zero waste strategy improves upon production processes and improving environmental prevention strategies which can lead to take larger, more innovative steps. * Supports sustainability. A zero waste strategy supports all three of the generally accepted goals of sustainability - economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being.[8] * Improved material flows. A zero waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills. Any material waste would either return as reusable or recycled materials or would be suitable for use as compost.[8] = Health = A major issue with landfills is hydrogen sulphide, which is released during the natural decay of waste. Studies have shown a positive association between increased lung cancer mortality rates and increased morbidity and mortality related to respiratory disease and hydrogen sulfide exposure. These studies also showed that the hydrogen sulfide exposure increased with proximity to the landfill. Household chemicals and prescription drugs are increasingly being found in large quantities in the leachate from landfills. This is causing concern about the ability of landfills to contain these materials and the possibility of these chemicals and drugs making their way into the groundwater and the surrounding environment. Zero waste promotes a circular material flow that allows materials to be used over and over, reducing the need for landfill space. Through zero waste the number of toxins released into the air and water would be decreased and products examined to determine what chemicals are used in the production process. Health Issues related to landfills: * Birth defects and low birth weight: Associated with close proximity to landfills, exposure to particle matter and nitrogen dioxide * Respiratory disease and lung cancer: Related to the release of hydrogen sulfide Zero waste's promotion of a cyclical product life can help reduce the need to create and fill landfills. This can help reduce incidences of respiratory diseases and birth defects that are associated with the toxins released from landfills. Zero waste also can help preserve local environments and drinking water sources by preventing pollutants from entering the ecosystem.  History  = 2002‚Äì2003 = The movement gained publicity and reached a peak in 1998‚Äì2002, and since then has been moving from \\"theory into action\\" by focusing on how a \\"zero waste community\\" is structured and behaves. The website of the Zero Waste International Alliance has a listing of communities across the globe that have created public policy to promote zero- waste practices. See also the Eco-Cycle website for examples of how this large nonprofit is leading Boulder County, Colorado on a Zero-Waste path and watch a 6-minute video about the zero-waste big picture. Finally, there is a USA zero- waste organization named the GrassRoots Recycling Network that puts on workshops and conferences about zero-waste activities. The California Integrated Waste Management Board established a zero waste goal in 2001. The City and County of San Francisco‚Äôs Department of the Environment established a goal of zero waste in 2002, which led to the City's Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance in 2009. With its ambitious goal of zero waste and policies, San Francisco reached a record-breaking 80% diversion rate in 2010, the highest diversion rate in any North American city. San Francisco received a perfect score in the waste category in the Siemens US and Canada Green City Index, which named San Francisco the greenest city in North America. = 2009: The Zero Waste lifestyle movement emerges = In 2008, Zero Waste was a term used to describe manufacturing and municipal waste management practices. Bea Johnson, a French American woman living in California, decided to apply it to her household of 4. In 2009, she started sharing her journey through the popular blog, Zero Waste Home, and in 2010, was featured in The New York Times.https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/fashion/18spy.html The article, which introduced mainstream to the concept of waste-free living, received much criticism from people confusing it for a bohemian lifestyle. These critical reviews began to shift after images of the family and their interior were widely broadcast in worldwide media. In 2013, Johnson published Zero Waste Home: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying your Life by Reducing your Waste. Dubbed ‚ÄúBible for the zero waste pursuer‚Äù by Book Riot, it provides a simple to follow methodology of 5R‚Äôs with in depth practical tips on how to eliminate waste in a household. Translated in 27 languages (as of 2019), the international bestseller helped spread the concept to a wide audience. Some of Bea‚Äôs followers and readers went on to 1) start their own blogs, such as Lauren Singer, an eco activist living in New York, whose Social Media channels spread the concept to millennials, 2) open package-free stores, such as Marie Delapierre who opened the first unpackaged store in Germanyhttps://unverpackt- kiel.de/wir#das-team-id (based on the model of Unpackagedhttps://www.beunpackaged.com/, the first package-free concept in our modern era), 3) launch non-profit organizations, such as Natalie Bino, founding member of Zero Waste Switzerland.https://zerowasteswitzerland.ch/en/ Over the years, the Zero Waste lifestyle experienced a significant increase in followers. Thousands of social media channels, blogs, unpackaged storeshttps://app.zerowastehome.com, lines of reusables and organizations have emerged worldwide. And in turn, the fast evolving grass root movement created a demand for large corporations, such as Unilever and Procter and Gamble, to conceive reusable alternatives to disposables. = Present day = An example of a zero waste starter kit that includes: a reusable water bottle, reusable cutlery, mason jars, upcycled spice jar, and reusable grocery bag. Behavior change is a central factor, necessary for shifting to more sustainable waste management but there is a lack of research with regards to behavior change intervention. Critics of Zero Waste point out that a material could be reusable, organic, non-toxic, and renewable but still be ethically inferior to single use products. Bags made of baby seal pelts or tiger skin, for example, theoretically meet the definitions of \\"zero waste\\", but are hardly superior to single use plastic bags. Similarly, a toxic material, such as lead in solder, may be replaced by less toxic materials like tin and silver. But if the mining of silver and tin releases more mercury or damages sensitive coral islands, the protection of landfills in developed nations is hardly paramount. While Zero Waste advocates have sophisticated answers as to why these examples do not meet the definition of Zero Waste (e.g., that the bodies of seals and tigers, or mining waste, is of equal concern), critics say that Life Cycle Analysis, habitat protection, carbon neutralization, or \\"Zero Extinction\\" are more environmentally astute philosophies than waste-centric measures. The simple accounting of measurable waste diversion, reuse, recycling rates, etc. is an attractive and useful tool, but a campaign based on a goal of literally stopping the last 5% of waste might will come at the expense of other environmental and sustainability goals. Within the waste industry itself, other tensions exist between those who view zero waste as post-discard total recycling of materials only, and those who view zero waste as the reuse of all high-level function. It is probably the defining difference between established recyclers and emerging zero-wasters. A signature example is a difference between smashing a glass bottle (recovering cheap glass) and refilling the bottle (recovering the entire function of the container). The tension between the literal application of natural processes and the creation of industry-specific more efficient reuse modalities is another tension. Many observers look to nature as an ultimate model for production and innovative materials. Others point out that industrial products are inherently non- natural (such as chemicals and plastics that are mono-molecular) and benefit greatly from industrial methods of reuse, while natural methods requiring degradation and reconstitution are wasteful in that context. Biodegradable plastic is the most prominent example. One side argues that biodegradation of plastic is wasteful because plastic is expensive and environmentally damaging to make. Whether made of starch or petroleum, the manufacturing process expends all the same materials and energy costs. Factories are built, raw materials are procured, investments are made, machinery is built and used, humans labor and make use of all normal human inputs for education, housing, food etc. Even if the plastic is biodegraded after a single use, all of those costs are lost so it is much more important to design plastic parts for multiple reuse or perpetual lives. The other side argues that keeping plastic out of a dump or the sea is the sole benefit of interest. Companies moving towards \\"zero landfill\\" plants include Subaru, Xerox and Anheuser-Busch. The movement continues to grow among the youth around the world under the organization Zero Waste Youthhttps://web.archive.org/web/20130528153545/http://zerowasteyouth.org/en/, which originated in Brazil and has spread to Argentina, Puerto Rico, Mexico, the United States, and Russia. The organization multiplies with local volunteer ambassadors who lead zero waste gatherings and events to spread the zero waste message. Packaging example Returnable glass milk bottles Milk can be shipped in many forms. One of the traditional forms was reusable returnable glass milk bottles, often home delivered by a milkman. While some of this continues, other options have recently been more common: one-way gable-top paperboard cartons, one-way aseptic cartons, one-way recyclable glass bottles, one-way milk bags, and others. Each system claims some advantages and also has possible disadvantages. From the zero waste standpoint, the reuse of bottles is beneficial because the material usage per trip can be less than other systems. The primary input (or resource) is silica-sand, which is formed into glass and then into a bottle. The bottle is filled with milk and distributed to the consumer. A reverse logistics system returns the bottles for cleaning, inspection, sanitization, and reuse. Eventually, the heavy-duty bottle would not be suited for further use and would be recycled. Waste and landfill usage would be minimized. The material waste is primarily the wash water, detergent, transportation, heat, bottle caps, etc. While true zero waste is never achieved, a life cycle assessment can be used to calculate the waste at each phase of each cycle.  Recycling and rotting (composting)  It is important to distinguish recycling from Zero Waste. Some claim that the key component to zero waste is recycling while others reject that notion in favor of reusing high function. The common understanding of recycling is simply that of placing bottles and cans in a recycle bin. The modern version of recycling is more complicated and involves many more elements of financing and government support. For example, a 2007 report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states that the US recycles at a national rate of 33.4% and includes in this figure composted materials. In addition many worldwide commodity industries have been created to handle the materials that are recycled. At the same time, claims of recycling rates have sometimes been exaggerated, for example by the inclusion of soil and organic matter used to cover garbage dumps daily, in the \\"recycled\\" column. In states with recycling incentives, there is constant local pressure to pump up the recycling rate figures. The movement toward recycling has separated itself from the concept of zero waste. One example of this is the computer industry where worldwide millions of PC's are disposed of as electronic waste each year (160 million in 2007). Those computers that enter the recycling stream are broken down into a small amount of raw materials while most merely enter dumps through export to third world countries. Companies are then able to purchase some raw materials, notably steel, copper and glass, reducing the use of new materials. On the other hand, there is an industry, more aligned with the Zero Waste principle of design for long term reuse, that actually repairs computers. It is called the Computer Refurbishing industry and it predates the current campaign to just collect and ship electronics. They have organizations and conferences and have for many years donated computers to schools, clinics and non-profits. Zero Waste planning demands that components be redesigned for effective reuse over long lives leading to even more refurbishing and repair. There is one seminal example that brings out the difference between Zero Waste and recycling in stark relief. That example, quoted in Getting To Zero Waste, is the software business. Zero Waste is sensitive to the waste of intellectual effort that would be caused by the need to recreate certain basic inventions of software (called objects in software design) as opposed to copying them over and over whenever needed. The waste would occur as the software developers consume resources while solving problems already solved earlier. The application of Zero Waste analysis is straightforward as it recommends conserving human effort. On the other hand, the usual approach of recycling would be to look for some materials that could be found to reuse. The materials on which software is saved (such as paper or diskettes)is of little significance compared to the saving of human effort and if software is saved electronically, there is no media at all. Thus Zero Waste correctly identifies a wasteful behavior to avoid while recycling has no application. The recycling movement has been embraced by the garbage industry because it serves so well as greenwashing i.e. a way to show that design for garbage creation is acceptable because materials will be kept out of a dump by recycling them. Zero Waste, on the other hand, offers the garbage industry no such screen against public condemnation of waste, and therefore actually threatens the continued need for garbage disposal. For example, in Alameda County, California, garbage dumping is charged a surcharge of $8/ton (as of 2009) which goes entirely for a recycling subsidy but none of which goes for any kind of Zero Waste style designing. Zero Waste has received no support from the garbage industry or politicians under their control except in those cases where it can be claimed to consist solely of more recycling. = Reduce, Reuse and Recycle = Zero waste is poorly supported by the enactment of government laws to enforce the waste hierarchy. In practice, these laws invariably emphasize destruction and recycling, while the reuse component is marginalized. A special feature of Zero Waste as a design principle is that it can be applied to any product or process, in any situation or at any level. Thus it applies equally to toxic chemicals as to benign plant matter. It applies to the waste of atmospheric purity by coal-burning or the waste of radioactive resources by attempting to designate the excesses of nuclear power plants as \\"nuclear waste\\". All processes can be designed to minimize the need for discard, both in their own operations and in the usage or consumption patterns which the design of their products leads to. Recycling, on the other hand, deals only with simple materials. Zero Waste can even be applied to the waste of human potential by enforced poverty and the denial of educational opportunity. It encompasses redesign for reduced energy wasting in industry or transportation and the wasting of the earth's rainforests. It is a general principle of designing for the efficient use of all resources, however defined. The recycling movement may be slowly branching out from its solid waste management base to include issues that are similar to the community sustainability movement. Zero waste, on the other hand, is not based in waste management limitations to begin with but requires that we maximize our existing reuse efforts while creating and applying new methods that minimize and eliminate destructive methods like incineration and recycling. Zero Waste strives to ensure that products are designed to be repaired, refurbished, re- manufactured and generally reused.. (\\"What is Zero Waste?\\", para 2). Online web services, like Free Cycle or the reGives Network have risen in popularity over the last decade where locals can give items that they no longer need to others locally in an effort to keep items out of landfills and work toward a zero waste lifestyle.  Significance of dump capacity  Many dumps are currently exceeding carrying capacity. This is often used as a justification for moving to Zero Waste. Others counter by pointing out that there are huge tracts of land available throughout the US and other countries which could be used for dumps. Proposals abound to destroy all garbage as a way to solve the garbage problem. These proposals typically claim to convert all or a large portion of existing garbage into oil and sometimes claim to produce so much oil that the world will henceforth have abundant liquid fuels. One such plan, called Anything Into Oil, was promoted by Discover Magazine and Fortune Magazine in 2004 and claimed to be able to convert a refrigerator into \\"light Texas crude\\" by the application of high-pressure steam. = Corporate initiatives = An example of a company that has demonstrated a change in landfill waste policy is General Motors (GM). GM has confirmed their plans to make approximately half of its 181 plants worldwide \\"landfill-free\\" by the end of 2010. Companies like Subaru, Toyota, and Xerox are also producing landfill- free plants. Furthermore, The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has worked with GM and other companies for decades to minimize the waste through its WasteWise program. The goal for General Motors is finding ways to recycle or reuse more than 90% of materials by: selling scrap materials, adopting reusable parts boxes to replace cardboard, and even recycling used work gloves. The remainder of the scraps might be incinerated to create energy for the plants. Besides being nature-friendly, it also saves money by cutting out waste and producing a more efficient production. All these organizations push forth to make our world clean and producing zero waste. A garden centre in Faversham, UK, has started to prevent plastic plant pots from being passed down to customers. Instead, it reuses the plastic pots only locally in the garden center, but upon selling it to its customers it repots the plants in paper plant pots. It also sells plants wrapped in hessian, and uses a variety of techniques to prevent handing down (single-use) plastics to customersEdibleculture in Faversham has stopped packaging its Christmas trees in plastic = Re-use or rot of waste = The waste sent to landfills may be harvested as useful materials, such as in the production of solar energy or natural fertilizer /de-composted manure for crops. It may also be reused and recycled for something that we can actually use. \\"The success of General Motors in creating zero-landfill facilities shows that zero-waste goals can be a powerful impetus for manufacturers to reduce their waste and carbon footprint,\\" says Latisha Petteway, a spokesperson for the EPA. Construction and deconstruction Zero Waste is a goal, a process, a way of thinking that profoundly changes our approach to resources and production. Zero Waste is not about recycling and diversion from landfills but about restructuring production and distribution systems to prevent waste from being manufactured in the first place. The materials that are still required in these re- designed, resource-efficient systems will be reused many times as the products that incorporate them are reused. Deconstruction can be described as construction in reverse. It involves carefully taking apart a building to maximize the reuse of materials, thereby reducing waste and conserving resources. Deconstruction can capture materials and some components from the millions of buildings that are existing and that were poorly designed for high level reuse but it is not a favored approach from a Zero Waste point of view. Zero Waste favors the design of buildings as assemblages of high level components, not their creation from rough materials such as lumber, cement or plaster. The details are not worked out yet but to the extent that entire rooms, entire walls, roofs or floors or entire utility systems can be pre- built and installed as completed components, that will be the goal of Zero Waste design. Until buildings are built as components capable of later dismantling, deconstruction is a stop-gap process that the United States can use to minimize the waste of building materials. For now, the largest parts that we are able to save tend to be architectural elements, windows, doors, and metals, many of which are being saved and resold by reuse yards such as Urban Ore in Berkeley, California. The main parts that still need to be crushed are wood flooring, brick walls, and structural timbers. The demolition of traditional buildings has been long done by wrecking ball or bulldozer. Social and political artifacts, such as demolition contractor licenses and required permits that can only be satisfied by destruction and discard (with partial recycling of rubble and steel), render the destruction and disposal costs cheaper than deconstruction. Approximately seventy pounds of the waste is generated for about every square foot of the residential building demolition. It is arguable that this is artificial economics, based on the cultural preference for wastefulness and that Zero Waste designs of dismantlable components will ultimately be the cheapest as well as the most conservative way to reuse buildings. Further discussions of this topic may be found on the ZWI website. Roper's comments in the paragraph above are either misquoted or wrong concerning wood flooring, structural wood and bricks needing to be crushed. Brick, wood and stone are among the oldest truly recyclable materials used in construction. A historic review of old buildings, barns and bridges clearly shows that brick, stones and timber are reused from older buildings. Some of the oldest structures on the planet are built with materials that were recycled from previous structures. One recent example is the Mayflower Barn at Jordans just north of High Wycombe, UK. The barn is clearly built of reused timbers, possibly sourced from the salvage of the Mayflower ship. It is simply a fact of life that historically materials that could be reused were reused. In more recent construction, structural timber components, including large timbers, glued laminated beams, floor joists, studs and flooring are some of the most valuable structural components salvaged when a structure is demolished if there is an interest in salvaging. If you need proof, go down to any local construction salvage yard and look at the value of trusses, wood beams, floor joists, studs and flooring. Today they have value when someone saves them. One of the barriers of reusing structural materials is the bias of building code officials and building departments that discriminate against reusing materials. Codes and building departments require compliance to codes, including the source of materials. Your average contractor cannot just use 100-year-old 2x8 (50x200) salvaged floor joists because the building department requires a graded joist. The contractor then has to find an engineer or wood technologist to verify the material suitability for its use. Market-based campaigns Market-based, legislation- mediated campaigns like Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and the Precautionary Principle are among numerous campaigns that have a Zero Waste slogan hung on them by means of claims they all ineluctably lead to policies of Zero Waste. At the moment, there is no evidence that EPR will increase reuse, rather than merely moving discard and disposal into private-sector dumping contracts. The Precautionary Principle is put forward to shift liability for proving new chemicals are safe from the public (acting as guinea pig) to the company introducing them. As such, its relation to Zero Waste is dubious. Likewise, many organizations, cities and counties have embraced a Zero Waste slogan while pressing for none of the key Zero Waste changes. In fact, it is common for many such to simply state that recycling is their entire goal. Many commercial or industrial companies claim to embrace Zero Waste but usually mean no more than a major materials recycling effort, having no bearing on product redesign. Examples include Staples, Home Depot, Toyota, General Motors and computer take-back campaigns. Earlier social justice campaigns have successfully pressured McDonald's to change their meat purchasing practices and Nike to change its labor practices in Southeast Asia. Those were both based on the idea that organized consumers can be active participants in the economy and not just passive subjects. However, the announced and enforced goal of the public campaign is critical. A goal to reduce waste generation or dumping through greater recycling will not achieve a goal of product redesign and so cannot reasonably be called a Zero Waste campaign.Producers should be made responsible for the packaging of the products rather than the consumers in EPR like campaigns by which the participation of the Producers will increase. How to achieve National and provincial governments often set targets and may provide some funding, but on a practical level, waste management programs (e.g. pickup, dropoff, or containers for recycling and composting) are usually implemented by local governments, possibly with regionally shared facilities. Reaching the goal of zero waste requires the products of manufacturers and industrial designers to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system; durability and repairability also reduce unnecessary churn in the product life cycle. Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain. If not mandated by government, choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero-waste-friendly products can influence production. More and more schools are motivating their students to live a different life and rethink every polluting step they may take.Zero waste#cite note-27 To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully.Zero waste#cite note-Snow-2 =The 5R‚Äôs of Bea Johnson= In the book, Zero Waste Home: The Ultimate Guide to Simplifying your Life by Reducing your WasteZero waste#cite note-28, the author, Bea Johnson, provides a modified version of the 3Rs, the 5Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Rot to achieve Zero Waste at home. The method, which she developed through years of practicing waste free living and used to reduce her family‚Äôs annual trash to fit in a pint jar, is now widely used by individuals, businesses and municipalities worldwide. =Zero Waste Hierarchy= The Zero Waste Hierarchy describes a progression of policies and strategies to support the Zero Waste system, from highest and best to lowest use of materials. It is designed to be applicable to all audiences, from policy-makers to industry and the individual. It aims to provide more depth to the internationally recognized 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle); to encourage policy, activity and investment at the top of the hierarchy; and to provide a guide for those who wish to develop systems or products that move us closer to Zero Waste. It enhances the Zero Waste definition by providing guidance for planning and a way to evaluate proposed solutions. All over the world, in some form or another, a pollution prevention hierarchy is incorporated into recycling regulations, solid waste management plans, and resource conservation programs. In Canada, a pollution prevention hierarchy otherwise referred to as the Environmental Protection Hierarchy was adopted. This Hierarchy has been incorporated into all recycling regulations within Canada and is embedded within all resource conservation methods which all government mandated waste prevention programs follow. While the intention to incorporate the 4th R (recovery)prior to disposal was good, many organizations focused on this 4th R instead of the top of the hierarchy resulting in costly systems designed to destroy materials instead of systems designed to reduce environmental impact and waste. Because of this, along with other resource destruction systems that have been emerging over the past few decades, Zero Waste Canada along with the Zero Waste International Alliance have adopted the only internationally peer reviewed Zero Waste Hierarchy that focuses on the first 3Rs; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle including Compost. Zero waste jurisdictions Various governments have declared zero waste as a goal, including: * Brazil ** Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina * Canada ** Vancouver (see Zero Waste 2040 Strategy) * Italy ** Capannori, Tuscany * Japan ** Kamikatsu, Tokushima *United States ** Austin, Texas ** Boulder, Colorado ** Fort Collins, Colorado ** San Francisco, California An example of network governance approach can be seen in the UK under New Labour who proposed the establishment of regional groupings that brought together the key stakeholders in waste management (local authority representatives, waste industry, government offices etc.) on a voluntary basis. There is a lack of clear government policy on how to meet the targets for diversion from landfill which increases the scope at the regional and local level for governance networks. The overall goal is set by government but the route for how to achieve it is left open, so stakeholders can coordinate and decide how best to reach it. Zero Waste is a strategy promoted by environmental NGOs but the waste industry is more in favour of the capital intensive option of energy from waste incineration. Research often highlights public support as the first requirement for success. In Taiwan, public opinion was essential in changing the attitude of business, who must transform their material use pattern to become more sustainable for Zero Waste to work. The latest development in Zero Waste is the city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi which promises to be a Zero Waste city. Innovation and technology is encouraged by government creating an innovation friendly environment without being prescriptive. To be a successful model of sustainable urban development it will also require the involvement and co-operation from all members of society emphasizing the importance of network governance.

Part of the site was on the other side of the A5, across the border in Northamptonshire. First opened in 1926, at its height in the 1950s it was the largest radio transmitting station in the world, with a total of 57 radio transmitters, covering an area of 1600 acres. Traffic slowly dwindled from the 1980s onwards, and the site was closed between 2003 and 2007. History Following the end of the First World War the British government set about implementing plans for an Imperial Wireless Chain to link the countries of the British Empire. It was decided that the new wireless service would be state- run by the Post Office. The site east of Hillmorton, was chosen in 1923. Part of the site had previously been occupied by RAF Lilbourne between 1915 and 1920. Its large very low frequency (VLF) transmitter came into service on 1 January 1926 and was originally used to transmit telegraph messages to the Commonwealth as part of the Imperial Wireless Chain. After the 1950s this transmitter, active as callsign GBR on 16.0 kHz, using Morse code and later on 15.975 kHz with frequency-shift keying FSK and minimum-shift keying MSK, was used for transmitting messages to submerged submarines. Criggion radio station acted as a reserve. The GBR transmitter was shut down on 1 April 2003 and was replaced by a new one at the Skelton transmitting station. Diagram of the transatlantic radio network. In 1927, a second transmitter was installed to initiate the first transatlantic commercial telephone service; linking New York and Londonhttp://www.smecc.org/general_electric_computers/Houltonrepeater06123partial.jpg on 60 kHz using single-sideband modulation. This transmitter was decommissioned in 1956 and became the time signal transmitter MSF. This new function developed from the decision, in 1951, to use the station to transmit modulated standard frequencies for scientific reference purposes. In 1972 these transmissions were consolidated onto the present frequency of 60 kHz and a further reference, that of a time signal, was added. In 1977 this took the form of the rolling slow code in use until April 2007, when BT's contract to transmit the time signal also passed to VT Communications, using their Anthorn radio station in Cumbria. The aerial system at the VLF transmitter existed between 1926 and 2004 and consisted of twelve 250 metre (820 ft) high, guyed steel-framework masts insulated against ground and carrying an aerial wire. This wire was mainly destroyed by heavy iceloads in the winter of 1940. After the shutdown of GBR, the facility was only used for transmitting the MSF time signal. Therefore, eight of the twelve masts were obsolete and demolished on the night of 19 June 2004 to 20 June 2004. A trial transmission of the LORAN-C navigation system was run at the station from June 2005 until March 2007.The remaining four 'tall' masts were demolished on 2 August 2007. The site is now being developed into a large new housing estate named Houlton, the first homes of which were occupied in December 2017.

Payne's nickname of \\"Tee Tot\\" is a pun for \\"teetotaler\\". It is said that Payne received his nickname because he usually carried a homemade mixture of alcohol and tea wherever he went. Early life According to Alabama historian Alice Harp, Payne was born in 1883 on the Payne Plantation in Sandy Ridge, Lowndes County, Alabama.The9513.com Career and influence Some say Tee Tot played the blues alone, others state that he led a little combo that played pop songs and hokum numbers and was a street musician. Tee Tot is best known for being a mentor to Hank Williams. Rufus Payne met Hank Williams when Hank was eight years old and legend has it he would come around and play Hank's guitar, showing Hank how to improvise chords. His influence in exposing Williams to blues and other African American influences helped Williams successfully fuse hillbilly, folk and blues into his own unique style, which in turn expanded and exposed both white and black audiences to the differing sounds. Death Payne died at a charity hospital in Montgomery, Alabama on March 17, 1939 at the age of 56. He is buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Montgomery, but his gravesite is unknown, so a memorial to him stands near the entrance to the cemetery, paid for by Hank Williams Jr. and other members of the Grand Ole Opry. Tributes Hank Williams, Jr. paid tribute to Tee Tot's influence on his father through \\"The Tee Tot Song\\" on his Almeria Club album. He was portrayed by actor Rex Ingram in the 1964 Hank Williams biopic Your Cheatin' Heart.

Engine displacement ranged from 1.8 to 2.6 litres, making it one of the largest four- cylinder engines of its time. Design It employed a hemispherical cylinder head, chain-driven single overhead camshaft (SOHC) and eight valves (two per cylinder). United States passenger car versions had a small secondary intake valve referred to as the \\"Jet Valve\\". This valve induced swirl in the intake charge, enabling the use of leaner fuel/air mixtures for lower emissions. It was designed as a cartridge containing the valve spring and seat which simply screwed into a threaded hole in the head, similar to a spark plug but inside the cam cover. The rocker arms for the intake valve were widened on the valve end to accommodate the cartridge, which was equipped with a very soft valve spring in order to avoid wear on the camshaft intake lobe. Modifications to the head were thereby reduced as the Jet Valve negated the necessity for a three-valve-per-cylinder design.\\"Development of a New Combustion System (MCA- JET) in Gasoline Engine\\", Hirokazu Nakamura, Tsuneo Ohinouye, Kenji Hori, Yuhiko Kiyota, Tatsuro Nakagami, Katsuo Akishino, Yutaka Tsukamoto, SAE International, February 1978 In 1975, the Astron 80 introduced a system dubbed \\"Silent Shaft\\": the first use of twin balance shafts in a modern engine. It followed the designs of Frederick Lanchester, whose original patents Mitsubishi had obtained, and proved influential as Fiat/Lancia, Saab and Porsche all licensed this technology. The 4D5 engine is a range of four- cylinder belt-driven overhead camshaft diesel engines which were part of the \\"Astron\\" family, and introduced in 1980 in the then new fifth generation Galant. As the first turbodiesel to be offered in a Japanese passenger car, it proved popular in the emerging SUV and minivan markets where Mitsubishi was highly successful, until superseded by the 4M4 range in 1993. However, production of the 4D5 (4D56) continued throughout the 1990s as a lower-cost option than the more modern powerplants. Until now it is still in production, but made into a modern powerplant by putting a common rail direct injection fuel system into the engine. 4G51 The 4G51 displaces .

The G54B for the US market had a cylinder head with additional jet valves to improve emissions (MCA-Jet system). The engine was fitted to various Mitsubishi models from 1978 to 1997 and to the American Chrysler K-cars and their derivatives between 1981 and 1987. It was primarily set up longitudinally for use in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive platforms but also as a transverse engine in the front-wheel drive platform of the Mitsubishi Magna and Chrysler K platform. Chrysler commonly marketed the engine \\"Hemi,\\" whereas the Australian-made version was marketed as the \\"Astron II\\" and featured \\"Balance Shaft\\" technology, which was subsequently licensed to Porsche and other automakers. The original engine featured a Mikuni two- barrel carburetor with a secondary vacuum actuator; later versions adopted EFI. Chrysler commonly paired this engine with its A470 3-speed automatic transmission; in Australia, Mitsubishi adapted it to a 5-speed manual transmission and its \\"ELC\\" (Electronic Control) 4-speed automatic transmission, featuring electronic overdrive. Chrysler eventually replaced the 4G54 with its own 2.5 L engine, whereas Mitsubishi replaced it with a 2.4 L engine codenamed 4G64.

Deregulation of the British bus industry in 1986 gave Stagecoach the opportunity to expand in its home town, thus fierce competition with the dominant operator Strathtay Scottish began, which eventually saw Stagecoach's then Perth Panther subsidiary emerge as the largest provider of bus services in the Perth area. On the breakup and privatisation of the Scottish Bus Group, Stagecoach was successful in acquiring two of the subsidiaries, namely Northern Scottish Omnibuses Ltd (in March 1991) and Fife Scottish Omnibuses Ltd (in July 1991).

Traction Group owned Strathtay Scottish, which Stagecoach had pushed out of Perth some 16 years earlier.https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/traction- group-bought-for-163-26m-1-2599620 The Strathtay operations bridged the gap between Stagecoach's Fife, Perth and Bluebird operations, giving the group a vast swathe of the country extending from Edinburgh through to Perth, northwards to Aberdeen and round to Inverness, with only Travel Dundee and First Aberdeen being the major non-Stagecoach operators within that area. Unusually, despite the Strathtay fleet receiving the corporate livery, they are being branded as Strathtay with Part of the Stagecoach Group straplines, rather than Stagecoach Strathtay or Stagecoach in Dundee/Angus, which is a break from current corporate practice. In early 2007, Stagecoach in Perth started one of two Stagecoach Gold services as a trial for Stagecoach Group. Along with the service run by Stagecoach Warwickshire, they offer newer vehicles to a higher standard, and are in a special gold and blue livery, Since the trails the Gold brand has expanded across the UK while the Perth service was upgraded with new Alexander Dennis Enviro350Hs.

It comprises 30 distinct ri (the smallest South Korean administrative division), and has a population of 8,427 (from 2003 registration figures). There are two elementary schools, a middle school and a high school. Hamchang was once the capital of a small kingdom, Goryeong Gaya. Although its role today is far less central, it remains an important local town, served by intercity buses as well as the Gyeongbuk Line railroad. Geography Hamchang is located about 19 kilometers north of the Sangju city center, and borders Jeomchon in Mungyeong City directly on the north. Within Sangju, it adjoins the local districts of Ian-myeon, Gonggeom-myeon, and Sabeol-myeon. It covers a total area of 43.37 km¬≤. Of this 16.87 km¬≤ are vacant. The vacant land is mostly mountainous, but contains no high peaks; Obong Mountain itself stands a mere 192 meters high. Hamchang's eastern border is formed by the Yeong River, which flows between Mungyeong's Yeongsun-myeon and Hamchang-eup. The Iancheon stream runs from west to east across southern Hamchang and into the Yeong, which shortly thereafter meets the Nakdong. History Tomb attributed to King Taejo of Goryeong Gaya, in Hamchang-eup, Sangju City. In the early Three Kingdoms period, the small kingdom of Goryeong Gaya is traditionally supposed to have been based in Hamchang, making it by far the northernmost state of the Gaya confederacy. The reputed tomb of Goryeong's founder, who is also the progenitor of the Hamchang Kim lineage, is located near the town center. On Obong Mountain, other tombs dating to the Three Kingdoms period have been excavated. These are sometimes associated with Sabeol-guk, a minor state which appears in early Silla records . What relation may have existed between Sabeol-guk and Goryeong Gaya, or whether they were in fact the same kingdom, is not known. By the early 6th century, the Hamchang area was securely under Silla control. It was subsequently administered as part of the ju of Sangju. At this time, Hamchang was known by various names which appear to suggest a connection with Goryeong Gaya, such as Goreung (Í≥†Î¶â, Âè§Èôµ), Gonyeong (Í≥†ÎÖï, Âè§ÂØß), and Godongnam-gun (Í≥†ÎèôÎûåÍµ∞, Âè§ÂÜ¨Ê¨ñÈÉ°). In the Goryeo period, in 964, the area became known as Hamnyeong-gun (Ìï®ÎÖïÍµ∞, Âí∏ÂØßÈÉ°). The name changed to the present \\"Hamchang\\" in 1018. In the Joseon period, the Hamchang area was designated as Hamchang- hyeon in 1490 and Hamchang-gun (Hamchang County) in 1895. In 1914, it became known as Hamchang-myeon and was included in Sangju County. It received its present designation as Hamchang-eup by presidential decree on December 1, 1980.

Tarquinia National Museum, Italy The culture of Europe is rooted in the art, architecture, film, different types of music, economic, literature, and philosophy that originated from the continent of Europe. European culture is largely rooted in what is often referred to as its \\"common cultural heritage\\".  Definition  Erasmus of Rotterdam. Because of the great number of perspectives which can be taken on the subject, it is impossible to form a single, all-embracing conception of European culture.Cederman (2001:2) remarks: \\"Given the absence of an explicit legal definition and the plethora of competing identities, it is indeed hard to avoid the conclusion that Europe is an essentially contested concept.\\" Cf. also Davies (1996:15); Berting (2006:51). Nonetheless, there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern Europe.Cf. Jordan-Bychkov (2008:13), Davies (1996:15), Berting (2006:51-56). One list of these elements given by K. Bochmann includes:K. Bochmann (1990) L'id√©e d'Europe jusqu'au XX√® si√®cle, quoted in Berting (2006:52). Cf. Davies (1996:15): \\"No two lists of the main constituents of European civilization would ever coincide. But many items have always featured prominently: from the roots of the Christian world in Greece, Rome and Judaism to modern phenomena such as the Enlightenment, modernization, romanticism, nationalism, liberalism, imperialism, totalitarianism.\\" * A common cultural and spiritual heritage derived from Greco-Roman antiquity, Christianity, Judaism, the Renaissance and its Humanism, the political thinking of the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution, and the developments of Modernity, including all types of socialism; * A rich and dynamic material culture that has been extended to the other continents as the result of industrialization and colonialism during the \\"Great Divergence\\"; * A specific conception of the individual expressed by the existence of, and respect for, a legality that guarantees human rights and the liberty of the individual; * A plurality of states with different political orders, which are feeding each other with new ideas; * Respect for peoples, states and nations outside Europe. Berting says that these points fit with \\"Europe's most positive realisations\\". The concept of European culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the Western world. In this definition, Western culture is the set of literary, scientific, political, artistic and philosophical principles which set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the Western canon.Duran (1995:81) The term has come to apply to countries whose history has been strongly marked by European immigration or settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Americas, and Australasia, and is not restricted to Europe.. The Nobel Prize laureate in Literature Thomas Stearns Eliot in his 1948 book Notes Towards the Definition of Culture, credited the prominent Christian influence upon the European culture: \\"It is in Christianity that our arts have developed; it is in Christianity that the laws of Europe have--until recently--been rooted.\\"  Art  The Venus of Willendorf, figure from between 28,000 and 25,000 BC. Now in the Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna. An example of prehistoric art. = Prehistoric art = Surviving European prehistoric art mainly comprises sculpture and rock art. It includes the oldest known representation of the human body, the Venus of Hohle Fel, dating from 40,000-35,000 BC, found in Schelklingen, Germany and the L√∂wenmensch figurine, from about 30,000 BC, the oldest undisputed piece of figurative art. The Swimming Reindeer of about 11,000 BCE is among the finest Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic. At the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced, and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot. The oldest European cave art dates back 40,800 and can be found in the El Castillo Cave in Spain, but cave art exists across the continent. Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those paintings have survived because of erosion. One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland. The Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin forms a distinct group with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing. The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Prehistoric Celtic art is another distinct grouping from much of Iron Age Europe and survives mainly in the form of high-status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. Full-length human figures of any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo. As the Romans conquered Celtic territories the style vanished, except in the British Isles, where it influenced the Insular style of the Early Middle Ages. = Classical art = Augustus of Prima Porta, statue of the emperor Augustus, 1st century AD, Vatican Museums. An example of Roman art. Ancient Greek art stands out among that of other ancient cultures for its development of naturalistic but idealised depictions of the human body, in which largely nude male figures were generally the focus of innovation. The rate of stylistic development between about 750 and 300 BC was remarkable by ancient standards, and in surviving works is best seen in Ancient Greek sculpture. There were important innovations in painting, which have to be essentially reconstructed due to the lack of original survivals of quality, other than the distinct field of painted pottery. Black-figure pottery and the subsequent red-figure pottery are famous and influential examples of the Ancient Greek decorative arts. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting and sculpture, but was also strongly influenced by the more local Etruscan art of Italy. Sculpture was perhaps considered as the highest form of art by Romans, but figure painting was also very highly regarded. Roman sculpture is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Among surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy, especially at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Such painting can be grouped into four main \\"styles\\" or periods and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'oeil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. Early Christian art grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art and adapted its iconography from these sources. = Medieval art = Medieval art can be broadly categorised into the Byzantine art of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Gothic art that emerged in Western Europe over the same period.Emperor Justinian and his court, from the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy. An example of Byzantine art. Byzantine art was strongly influenced by its classical heritage, but distinguished itself by the development of a new, abstract, aesthetic, marked by anti- naturalism and a favour for symbolism. The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. However, the Byzantines inherited the Early Christian distrust of monumental sculpture in religious art, and produced only reliefs, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from Carolingian art onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief. The so-called \\"minor arts\\" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation Consular diptychs or caskets such as the Veroli casket, hardstone carvings, enamels, glass, jewelry, metalwork, and figured silks were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. The Birth of Venus, Sandro Botticelli, c. 1485. Now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy. An example of Renaissance art. Migration Period art includes the art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the distinct Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the Scythian and Germanic animal style. After Christianization, Migration Period art developed into various schools of Early Medieval art in Western Europe which are normally classified by region, such as Anglo-Saxon art and Carolingian art, before the continent-wide styles of Romanesque art and finally Gothic art developed. Romanesque art and Gothic art dominated Western and Central Europe from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the Renaissance style in the 15th century or later, depending on region. The Romanesque style was greatly influenced by Byzantine and Insular art. Religious art, such as church sculpture and decorated manuscripts, was particularly prominent. Art of the period was characterised by a very vigorous style in both sculpture and painting. Colours tended to be very striking and mostly primary. Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to be squeezed into the shapes of historiated initials, column capitals, and church tympanums. Figures often varied in size in relation to their importance, and landscape backgrounds, if attempted at all, were closer to abstract decorations than realism. Gothic art developed from Romanesque art in Northern France the 12th century AD, led by the concurrent development of Gothic architecture. It spread to all of Western Europe, and much of Southern and Central Europe. In the late 14th century, the sophisticated court style of International Gothic developed, which continued to evolve until the late 15th century. In many areas, especially England and Germany, Late Gothic art continued well into the 16th century. Gothic art was often typological in nature, showing the stories of the New Testament and the Old Testament side by side. Saints' lives were often depicted. Images of the Virgin Mary changed from the Byzantine iconic form to a more human and affectionate mother, often showing the refined manners of a courtly lady. Secular art came into its own during the gothic period alongside the creation of a bourgeois class who could afford to patronise the arts and commission works. Increased literacy and a growing body of secular vernacular literature encouraged the representation of secular themes in art. With the growth of cities, trade guilds were formed and artists were often required to be members of a painters' guild‚Äîas a result, because of better record keeping, more artists are known to us by name in this period than any previous. = Renaissance art = David (Michelangelo). Renaissance art emerged as a distinct style in northern Italy from around 1420, in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature, music and science. It took as its foundation the art of Classical antiquity, but was also influenced by the art of Northern Europe and contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious altarpieces, fresco cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. Painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to Jacobus de Voragine's Golden Legend (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of saints that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. Interest in classical antiquity and Renaissance humanism also resulted in many Mythological and history paintings. Decorative ornament, often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.The alt= Dance at Le moulin de la Galette, by Pierre- Auguste Renoir, 1876, oil on canvas, height: 131 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay (Paris). Techniques characteristic of Renaissance art include the use of proportion and linear perspective; foreshortening, to create an illusion of depth; sfumato, a technique of softening of sharp outlines by subtle blending of tones to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality; and chiaroscuro, the effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. = Mannerism, Baroque and Rococo = Renaissance Classicism spawned two different movements‚ÄîMannerism and the Baroque. Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasise the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. Where High Renaissance art emphasises proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities. It favours compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. In contrast, Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama. Perhaps the best known Baroque painters are Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Diego Vel√°zquez. Baroque art is often seen as part of the Counter-Reformation‚Äî the revival of spiritual life in the Roman Catholic Church. Religious and political themes are widely explored within the Baroque artistic context, and both paintings and sculptures are characterised by a strong element of drama, emotion and theatricality. Baroque art was particularly ornate and elaborate in nature, often using rich, warm colours with dark undertones. Dutch Golden Age painting is a distinct subset of Baroque, leading to the development of secular genres such as still life, genre paintings of everyday scenes, and landscape painting. By the 18th century Baroque art had developed into the Rococo in France. Rococo art was even more elaborate than the Baroque, but it was less serious and more playful. The artistic movement no longer placed an emphasis on politics and religion, focusing instead on lighter themes such as romance, celebration, and appreciation of nature. Furthermore, it sought inspiration from the artistic forms and ornamentation of Far Eastern Asia, resulting in the rise in favour of porcelain figurines and chinoiserie in general. Rococo soon fell out of favour, being seen by many as a gaudy and superficial movement emphasizing aesthetics over meaning. = Neoclassical, Romanticism, and Realism = Neoclassicism began in the 18th century as counter movement opposing the Rococo. It desired for a return to the simplicity, order and 'purism' of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the United Kingdom. In many ways Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one. Neoclassical art places an emphasis on order, symmetry and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. Ingres, Canova, and Jacques- Louis David are among the best-known neoclassicists. Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, Romanticism rejected the aesthetic of the Neoclassicists, specifically the highly objective and ordered nature of Neoclassicism, favouring instead a more individual and emotional approach to the arts. Emphasis was placed on nature, especially when aiming to portray the power and beauty of the natural world, and emotions. Romantic art often used colours in order to express feelings and emotion. Romantic art was inspitred by ancient Greek and Roman art and mythology, but also takes much of its aesthetic qualities from medievalism and Gothicism, as well as later mythology and folklore. Among the greatest Romantic artists were Eug√®ne Delacroix, Francisco Goya, J.M.W. Turner, John Constable, Caspar David Friedrich, and William Blake. In response to these changes caused by Industrialisation, the movement of Realism emerged, which sought to accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and despair. While Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, Realism was a literary as well as an artistic movement. Other contemporary movements were more Historicist in nature, such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who attempted to return art to its state of \\"purity\\" prior to Raphael, and the Arts and Crafts Movement, which reacted against the impersonality of mass-produced goods and advocated a return to medieval craftsmanship.  Music  = Classical Music = =pre-1600= This broad era encompasses early music, which generally comprises Medieval music (500‚Äì1400) and Renaissance music (1400‚Äì1600), but sometimes includes Baroque music (1600‚Äì1760). =post-1600= This era includes the common practice period from approximately 1600 to 1900, as well as the modernist and postmodernist styles that emerged after 1900 and which continue to the present day. = Modern Music = Folk music: Europe has a wide and diverse range of indigenous music, sharing common features in rural, travelling or maritime communities. Folk music is embedded in an unwritten, oral tradition, but was increasingly transcribed from the nineteenth century onwards. Many classical composers used folk melodies, and folk has influenced some popular music in Europe. See the list of European folk musics. Popular music: Europe has also imported many different genres of music, ranging from Blues, Jazz, Soul, Pop, Electronic, Hip-Hop, R&B; and Dance.  Media  = Television = Main articles: List of European television stations = Radio = Main articles: Lists of radio stations in Europe = Newspapers = Main articles:  Architecture  Stonehenge, Wiltshire, United Kingdom, is one of the world's best known megalithic structures. = Prehistoric architecture = The Neolithic long house was a long, narrow timber dwelling built by the first farmers in Europe beginning at least as early as the period 5000 to 6000 BC. Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, the Orkney Islands, Scotland, are stone-built Neolithic settlement dating from 3,500 BC. Megaliths found in Europe and the Mediterranean were also erected in the Neolithic period. See Neolithic architecture. = Ancient Classical architecture = The Parthenon, Athens, Greece, is an example of Ancient Greek architecture. Ancient Greek architecture was produced by the Greek-speaking people whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands, and in colonies in Anatolia and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD. Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalised characteristics, both of structure and decoration. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the Doric Order, the Ionic Order and the Corinthian Order, was to have profound effect on Western architecture of later periods. Rome Pantheon, Italy, cylindrical Roman temple with a portico Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but differed from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style. The two styles are often considered one body of classical architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and even more so under the Empire, when the great majority of surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials, particularly concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and well- engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the empire, sometimes complete and still in use. = Medieval architecture = Le√≥n Cathedral, Castile and Leon, Spain, built in the Gothic style.Romanesque architecture combines features of ancient Roman and Byzantine buildings and other local traditions. It is known by its massive quality, thick walls, round arches, sturdy pillars, groin vaults, large towers and decorative arcading. Each building has clearly defined forms, frequently of very regular, symmetrical plan; the overall appearance is one of simplicity when compared with the Gothic buildings that were to follow. The style can be identified right across Europe, despite regional characteristics and different materials, and is most frequently seen in churches. Plenty of examples of this architecture are found alongside the Camino de Santiago. Gothic architecture flourished in Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as Opus Francigenum (\\"French work\\") with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance. Its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of Romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Gothic architecture is most familiar as the architecture of many of the great cathedrals, abbeys and churches of Europe. = Renaissance and Neoclassical architecture = Santa Maria Novella, Florence, Italy, an example of Renaissance architecture. Renaissance architecture began in the early 14th and lasted until the early 17th century. It demonstrates a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman architectural thought and material culture, particularly the symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts of ancient buildings. Developed first in Florence, with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact Palladian architecture was derived from and inspired by the designs of the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508‚Äì1580). Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. From the 17th century Palladio's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism. It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century, and continued to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings. Palace of Queluz, Lisbon District, Portugal, an example of Baroque architecture. Baroque architecture began in 16th-century Italy. It took the Roman vocabulary of Renaissance architecture and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion. It was, initially at least, directly linked to the Counter- Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to reform itself in response to the Protestant Reformation. Baroque was characterised by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and a freer treatment of classical elements. It reached its extreme form in the Rococo style. = 19th-century architecture = The Hungarian Parliament Building in Budapest, an example of Gothic revival architecture.Revivalism was a hallmark of nineteenth-century European architecture. Revivals of the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles all took place, alongside revivals of the Classical styles. Regional styles, such as English Tudor were also revived, as well as non- European styles, such as Chinese (Chinoiserie) and Egyptian. These revivals often used elements of the original style in a freer way than original examples, sometimes borrowing from multiple styles at once. At Alnwick Castle, for example, Gothic revival elements were added to the exterior of the original medieval castle, while the interiors were designed in a Renaissance style. Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Fa√ßades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament. = 20th-century and modern architecture = Art Deco architecture began in Brussels in 1903‚Äì4. Early buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the art nouveau style. After the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States. Buildings became more decorated, and interiors were extremely colourful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel. Modernist architecture is a term applied to a group of styles of architecture which emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II. It was based upon new technologies of construction, particularly the use of glass, steeland reinforced concrete; and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and Beaux-Arts styles that were popular in the 19th century. Modernist architecture continued to be the dominant architectural style for institutional and corporate buildings into the 1980s, when it was challenged by postmodernism.Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana, Barcelona, Spain, a modernisme building.Expressionist architecture is a form of modern architecture that began during the first decades of the 20th century, in parallel with the expressionist visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in Germany. In the 1950s, a second movement of expressionist architecture developed, initiated by the Ronchamp Chapel Notre- Dame-du-Haut (1950‚Äì1955) by Le Corbusier. The style was individualistic, but tendencies include Distortion of form for an emotional effect, efforts at achieving the new, original, and visionary, and a conception of architecture as a work of art. Postmodern architecture emerged in the 1960s as a reaction against the austerity, formality, and lack of variety of modern architecture, particularly in the international style advocated by Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Embraced in the USA first, it spread to Europe. In contrast to Modernist buildings, Postmodern buildings have curved forms, decorative elements, asymmetry, bright colours, and features often borrowed from earlier periods. Colours and textures unrelated to the structure of function of the building. While rejecting the \\"puritanism\\" of modernism, it called for a return to ornament, and an accumulation of citations and collages borrowed from past styles. It borrowed freely from classical architecture, rococo, neoclassical architecture, the Viennese secession, the British arts and crafts movement, the German Jugendstil. Deconstructivist architecture is a movement of postmodern architecture which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building. It is characterised by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. Its name comes from the idea of \\"Deconstruction\\", a form of semiotic analysis developed by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida. Besides fragmentation, Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure's surface skin and creates by non-rectilinear shapes which appear to distort and dislocate elements of architecture. The finished visual appearance is characterised by unpredictability and controlled chaos.

Accessed July 2011. Compared with traditional cooking of Asian countries, for example, meat is more prominent and substantial in serving- size. Steak in particular is a common dish across Europe. European cuisines also put substantial emphasis on sauces as condiments, seasonings, or accompaniments (in part due to the difficulty of seasonings penetrating the often larger pieces of meat used in European cooking). Many dairy products are utilised in the cooking process, except in nouvelle cuisine. Wheat-flour bread has long been the most common sources of starch in this cuisine, along with pasta, dumplings and pastries, although the potato has become a major starch plant in the diet of Europeans and their diaspora since the European colonization of the Americas. The common way to eat a beef or pork chop is with a knife in the right hand and a fork in the left way. To begin a such meal by first chopping the meat up, and then just use a fork with the right hand, is generally considered to be bad manners, especially at restaurants.

As a work of fantasy it belongs to the Dying Earth subgenre. Hodgson also published a much shorter version of the novel, entitled The Dream of X (1912). The Night Land was revived in paperback by Ballantine Books, which republished the work in two parts as the 49th and 50th volumes of its Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in July 1972. H. P. Lovecraft's essay \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\" describes the novel as \\"one of the most potent pieces of macabre imagination ever written\\". Clark Ashton Smith wrote of it: When the book was written, the nature of the energy source that powers stars was not known: Lord Kelvin had published calculations based on the hypothesis that the energy came from the gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that had formed the sun and found that this mechanism gave the Sun a lifetime of only a few tens of million of years. Starting from this premise, Hodgson wrote a novel describing a time, millions of years in the future, when the Sun has gone dark. Plot summary The beginning of the book establishes the framework in which a 17th-century gentleman, mourning the death of his beloved, Lady Mirdath, is given a vision of a far-distant future where their souls will be re-united, and sees the world of that time through the eyes of a future incarnation. The language and style used are intended to resemble that of the 17th century, though the prose has features characteristic of no period whatsoever: the almost-complete lack of dialogue and proper names, for example. Critic Ian Bell has suggested that John Milton's epic poem \\"Paradise Lost\\" (1667) is probably a partial literary inspiration for Hodgson's novel, especially due to the hellish visions of sombre intensity which mark both works, and other similarities including the use of massive structures (the Temple of Pandemonium in Milton and the Last Redoubt in The Night Land).Ian Bell. \\"A Dream of Darkness: William Hope Hodgson's The Night Land\\". Studies in Weird Fiction 1, No 1(Summer 1986), pp. 13‚Äì18. Once into the book, the 17th century framing is mostly inconsequential. Instead, the story focuses on the future. The Sun has gone out and the Earth is lit only by the glow of residual vulcanism. The last few millions of the human race are gathered together in a gigantic metal pyramid, nearly eight miles high ‚Äì the Last Redoubt, under siege from unknown forces and Powers outside in the dark. These are held back by a shield known as the \\"air clog\\", powered from a subterranean energy source called the \\"Earth Current\\". For millennia, vast living shapes‚Äîthe Watchers‚Äîhave waited in the darkness near the pyramid. It is thought they are waiting for the inevitable time when the Circle's power finally weakens and dies. Other living things have been seen in the darkness beyond, some of unknown origins, and others that may once have been human. To leave the protection of the Circle means almost certain death, or worse an ultimate destruction of the soul. As the story commences, the narrator establishes mind contact with an inhabitant of another, forgotten Lesser Redoubt. First one expedition sets off to succour the inhabitants of the Lesser Redoubt, whose own Earth Current has been exhausted, only to meet with disaster. After that, the narrator sets off alone into the darkness to find the girl he has made contact with, knowing now that she is the reincarnation of his past love. At the conclusion of the adventure, the narrative does not return to the framework story, instead ending with the homecoming of the couple and his inauguration into the ranks of their most honoured heroes. =Abhumans= The term \\"Abhuman\\" was used by Hodgson in The Night Land to name (apparently) several different species of intelligent beings evolved from humans who interbred with alien species or adapted to changed environmental conditions and were seen as decayed or malign by those living inside the Last Redoubt, who preserved artificially (to an unspecified extent) their human characteristics, though they were not fit for the new environmental conditions. The Dream of X The abridged version of the novel was first published in the United States in 1912 in chapbook form as Poems and a Dream of X (New York: R. H. Paget, 1912), in an extremely limited print run. In this edition, the 200,000-word novel was condensed to a 20,000-word novelette, originally for the purpose of establishing copyright; also included was a novelette entitled Mutiny, an abridged version of the story \\"'Prentices' Mutiny,\\" and thirteen of Hodgson's poems, which were later included in his other posthumously published books of poetry. The abridgement by itself was republished in a limited edition in 1977, with an introduction by Sam Moskowitz and color illustrations by Stephen Fabian, under the title The Dream of X (West Kingston, R.I.: Donald M. Grant, 1977). Technologies of the Night Land =Telepathy= While the entire human population seems to have some capacity for telepathic communication (in the book called \\"The Night Hearing\\"), the main character has unusually strong abilities and is capable of communicating with his lost love using his \\"brain-elements.\\" This seems to indicate a specialised organ in the brain, perhaps evolved or genetically engineered, or perhaps some kind of implant. Hodgson also introduces a kind of authentication known as the \\"master word.\\" This is reminiscent of a modern public-key cryptography; humans can apparently generate a correct response, while the non-human monsters who attempt to lead them astray by intercepting and forging telepathic communications can't do so. =Powdered Water and Food Tablets= Hodgson's hero sets out into the Night Land carrying lightweight food tablets and a sealed tube full of \\"water-powder.\\" When a small quantity of this powder is exposed to air, it rapidly condenses moisture and produces drinkable water. While lightweight dehydrated foods exist, water-powder is scientifically implausible (though see deliquescence), but together these serve to explain how the hero can carry enough food and drink to survive his journey in the inhospitable Night Land. =The Diskos= The diskos is a weapon featuring a razor-sharp spinning disk on a retractable handle. When activated the disk glows and shoots out sparks. This invention may have been inspired by a hand-held children's toy that shoots sparks when a button is pressed to start a small spinning disk. It is also indicated that the diskos develops a special affinity for its owner during training and should not be handled by anyone else. Each diskos is powered from an initial charge taken from the Earth Current. When its owner dies, the Diskos and its charge are returned to the Earth Current. =The Last Redoubt= The Last Redoubt is a mountain-sized building described to contain millions of people and feature vast farmlands underground, powered by the mysterious \\"earth-current.\\" The upper levels of the redoubt are at so high an altitude that they must be pressurized, and the residents have developed enlarged lung capacity. Each level of the Pyramid contains a great city so that there are, in total, \\"one thousand, three hundred and twenty cities of the Pyramid.\\" Hodgson's hero describes the Redoubt in Chapter 2: Additionally Hodgson's narrator describes the base of the Redoubt stretching \\"five and one-quarter miles every way.\\" Directly beneath the Redoubt, \\"an hundred miles deep in the earth below the Redoubt\\" lay the Underground Fields: The fields are \\"sheathed-in at the sides with the grey metal of which the Redoubt was built\\", the grey metal may also lie beneath the soil of each field, acting as a subfloor through which \\"the monsters could not dig into that mighty garden from without\\". Each field is upheld by pillars and lit by the Earth-Current. The Earth-Current also runs through the soil of the fields supplying the plants and trees with the nutrition necessary to support life far beneath the Pyramid. The dirt and rock excavated during the making of the Fields was dumped into the bottomless \\"Crack\\" from which the Pyramid draws the Earth-Current. The narrator supposes that the Fields have their own air system that is not connected with the \\"monster air-shafts of the Pyramid\\", but cannot verify this due to the immensity of the Redoubt and the knowledge lost during the years since its construction. The narrator recounts fields of corn, grain and poppies growing in the vast chambers beneath the Redoubt. Near the end of the novel (chapter XIV), after talking about the Underground Fields, Hodgson wrote about hidden conduits bringing water from distant seas. Those conduits \\"did be mighty underground pipes that went across the Night Land, and did be, mayhap, oft so much as twenty great miles deep in the world, and did come upward into the seas of the Land; and all to have been made secret and hid from the monsters of the Land, as I to know from much reading of the Histories.\\" =The Lesser Redoubt= The majority of The Night Land is devoted to the hero's quest to find a Lesser Redoubt in which he believes his reincarnated long-lost love awaits him. This second Redoubt was built sometime after the completion of the original by a large group of humans who wandered the land \\"who had grown weary of wandering, and weary of the danger of night attacks by the tribes of half- human monsters which began to inhabit the earth even so early as the days when the half-gloom was upon the world.\\" This second Redoubt was originally built on the far shore of a sea that has disappeared by the narrator's lifetime. The Lesser Redoubt is a three-sided Pyramid, smaller than the original standing at little more than a mile in height and only three-quarters of a mile along the bases. The architect of the Lesser Redoubt was a man who had once lived in the Great Redoubt, but who had been punished for disturbing the order of the Redoubt with his \\"spirit of irresponsibility\\" by those in the lowest city of the great Pyramid. The Lesser Redoubt was built in a \\"great valley\\" leading from the shore where signs of the Earth-Current were detected. After a time, however, the Earth-Current began to wane and no greater source for the Current could be discovered despite thousands of years of searching. Eventually communications between the two Redoubts ceased as the Lesser no longer had the power to transmit messages; during this time humans still struggled to live within the Lesser Redoubt, despite their failing powers and resources. \\"And thereafter came a million years, maybe, of silence; with ever the birthing and marrying and dying of those lonesome humans. And they grew less; and some put this to the lack of the Earth-Current, which dwindled slowly through the centuries of that Eternity.\\" Pastiche, homages and sequels Greg Bear's short story, \\"The Way of All Ghosts\\", dedicated to William Hope Hodgson, is set in the Way, the artificial space-time structure featured in several of Bear's novels, beginning with Eon (1985). A recurring character from these novels, Ser Olmy, is given a mission to investigate an experiment which had gone horribly wrong. The experimenters had attempted to open a gate into a universe of pure order, and the survivors find themselves trapped in a region of the Way that has transformed to a chaotic state resembling the Night Land. Another work of Greg Bear's, City at the End of Time (2008), shares a number of plot elements with The Night Land and contains a specific reference to the Last Redoubt, giving William Hope Hodgson himself a cameo role in the story line. The short-fiction collections William Hope Hodgson's Night Lands: Eternal Love (2003) and William Hope Hodgson's Night Lands: Nightmares of the Fall (2007) contain short stories set in a universe combining The Night Land with The House on the Borderland. A third collection (to be titled The Days of Darkening) was still in progress . The first collection was nominated for a British Fantasy Award for Best Anthology by the British Fantasy Society in 2004. John Stoddard's novel, The Night Land, A Story Retold (2011) is a retelling of The Night Land, intended for modern readers who may be unwilling to read the archaic language of the original. While retaining the story of The Night Land, it departs from the original by naming the main character, adding brief scenes, and using dialogue (the original version had none). An early draft of the second chapter of Stoddard's rewrite appears in William Hope Hodgson's Night Lands: Eternal Love. Awake in the Night Land (2014) is a new collection of stories set in the world of Night Land written by John C. Wright, published by Castalia House.

Background Drega had a long history of conflict with government officials over code enforcement issues, starting in the 1970s over whether he could use tarpaper to side his vacation house in Columbia, New Hampshire. He claimed that in 1981, of the riverbank along his property collapsed during a rainstorm. Drega decided to dump and pack enough dirt to repair the erosion damage, saying this would restore his lot along the Connecticut River to its original size. State officials, on the other hand, contested that Drega was trying to change the course of the river. In 1995, the town selectman Vickie Bunnell accompanied a town tax assessor to Drega's property in a dispute over an assessment. Drega fired shots into the air to drive them away. Drega bought an AR-15 rifle and armor vest, and began equipping his property with early-warning electronic noise and motion detectors. Shooting On August 19, 1997, at about 2:30, New Hampshire state trooper Scott Phillips stopped Drega in the parking lot of LaPerle's IGA supermarket in neighboring Colebrook for having too much rust on his pickup truck.Steve Wulf, Colebrook - A time bomb explodes, June 24, 2001, in content.time.com. Drega got out of his truck with his rifle and fired upon Trooper Phillips. Trooper Phillips was hit but returned fire before retreating into a nearby field. Drega followed Phillips into the field and murdered him. Trooper Leslie Lord pulled into the LaPerle's parking lot moments later, and from approximately 150 feet (45.72 m) away, Drega shot and killed Lord before he could even get out of his police car. Drega then stole Phillips' police car, and drove to the office of Colebrook District Court judge Vickie Bunnell to murder her. Bunnell reportedly carried a handgun in her purse out of fear of Drega, but may not have had it with her that day. Seeing Drega approaching the building with his rifle, she warned fellow staffers to evacuate as she ran for an exit. Drega shot Bunnell in the back from a range of about , killing her. Dennis Joos, editor of the local Colebrook News and Sentinel, attempted to disarm Drega after Bunnell fell. During the struggle Drega shot and killed Joos. Drega returned to his property and set his house on fire. New Hampshire Fish & Game warden Wayne Saunders observed Drega driving the state police car. Drega turned and crossed the state line to Bloomfield, Vermont, exited the police car and fired upon Saunders. Saunders was hit with several bullets through his vehicle in his arm and shoulder, including one that struck his badge, saving him from a likely fatal wound. Saunders retreated under the hail of fire by driving in reverse, and crashing into the Connecticut River. Drega set up his last stand on a dead end road on the Vermont side of the river. Police from numerous state, local and federal agencies descended upon Drega's position. Drega sprang his ambush, shooting NH state trooper Jeffrey Caulder in the lower abdomen, NH state trooper Robert Haase in the foot, and U.S. Border Patrol agent John Pfeifer in the chest. After the gunfire died down, agents moved a police vehicle to the scene in an attempt to evacuate Pfeifer before he bled to death. But once the vehicle approached, Drega began firing again, forcing the officers to take cover. Eventually, NH state trooper Charles West and Border Patrol agent Stephen Brooks advanced up a slope to Drega's position. As Drega stepped out from behind a tree to fire, Brooks opened up with his M14 rifle while West fired a slug from his Remington 870 shotgun, killing Drega and ending the gunfight.Shots Fired: Bloomfield, Vermont 08/19/1997.

The drive motor is at the extreme right; the speed-increaser gearbox is just to its left. Note the bronze-colored shaft coupling. Grimeton Radio Station () in southern Sweden, close to Varberg in Halland, is an early longwave transatlantic wireless telegraphy station built in 1922-1924, that has been preserved as a historical site. From the 1920s through the 1940s it was used to transmit telegram traffic by Morse code to North America and other countries, and during World War 2 was Sweden's only telecommunication link with the rest of the world. It is the only remaining example of an early pre-electronic radio transmitter technology called an Alexanderson alternator. It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2004, with the statement: \\"Grimeton Radio Station, Varberg is an outstanding monument representing the process of development of communication technology in the period following the First World War.\\" The radio station is also an anchor site for the European Route of Industrial Heritage. The transmitter is still in operational condition, and each year on a day called Alexanderson Day is started up and transmits brief Morse code test transmissions, which can be received all over Europe. History Beginning around 1910 industrial countries built networks of powerful transoceanic longwave radiotelegraphy stations to communicate telegraphically with other countries. During the First World War radio became a strategic technology when it was realized that a nation without long distance radio capability could be isolated from the rest of the world by an enemy cutting its submarine telegraph cables. In 1921, Sweden's geographical dependence on other countries' underwater cable networks, and the temporary loss of those vital connections during the war, motivated a decision by the Swedish Parliament to build a radiotelegraphy station in Sweden to transmit telegram traffic across the Atlantic. At the time, there were several different technologies used for high power radio transmission, each owned by a different giant industrial company. Bids were requested from Telefunken in Berlin, The Marconi Company in London, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in New York and Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise Radio-Electrique in Paris. The transmitter chosen was the Alexanderson alternator, invented around 1906 by Swedish-American Ernst Alexanderson and manufactured by RCA. This consisted of a huge rotating electromechanical AC generator (alternator) turned by an electric motor at a fast enough speed that it generated radio frequency alternating current, which was applied to the antenna. It was one of the first transmitters to generate sinusoidal continuous waves, which could communicate at longer range than the damped waves which were used by the earlier spark gap transmitters. After careful calculations, the station was located in Grimeton, on the southwest coast of Sweden, which allowed good radio wave propagation conditions over the North Atlantic to North America. To achieve daytime communication over such long distances, transoceanic stations took advantage of an earth-ionosphere waveguide mechanism which required them to transmit at frequencies in the very low frequency (VLF) range below 30 kHz. Radio transmitters required extremely large antennas to radiate these long waves efficiently. The Grimeton station had a huge flattop antenna 1.9 km (1.2 miles) long consisting of twelve (later reduced to eight) wires supported on six 127 m (380 foot) high steel towers. The station started operation in 1924, transmitting radiotelegraphy traffic with the callsign SAQ at 200 kW on a frequency of 16.5 kilohertz, later changed to 17.2 kHz, to RCA's Radio Central receivers on Long Island, New York. The Alexanderson alternator technology was becoming obsolete even as it was installed. Vacuum tube electronic oscillator transmitters, which used the triode vacuum tube invented by Lee De Forest in 1907, replaced most pre- electronic transmitters in the early 1920s. However the large capital investment in an alternator transmitter caused owners to keep these huge behemoths in use long after they were technologically obsolete. By the 1930s transatlantic communication had switched to short waves, and vacuum tube shortwave transmitters were installed in the main building, and a log periodic shortwave antenna on the roof. The Alexanderson alternator found a second use as a naval transmitter to communicate with submarines, as VLF frequencies can penetrate a short distance into seawater. During the Second World War 1939-1945, the station experienced a heyday, when it was Scandinavia's gateway to the outside world. Underwater communication cable connections had once again been quickly severed by nations at war and the radiotelegraphy transmissions were a link to the outside world. It continued to be used for naval transmissions until 1960. Grimeton Radio Station is now the only station left in the transatlantic network of nine long wave stations that were built during the years 1918-1924, all equipped with Alexanderson alternators. In 2004 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The Grimeton transmitter is the last surviving example of an Alexanderson alternator, the only radio station left from the pre-vacuum tube era, and is still in working condition. Each year, on a day called Alexanderson Day, either on the last Sunday in June, or on the first Sunday in July, whichever comes closer to 2 July, the site holds an open house during which the transmitter is started up and transmits test messages on 17.2 kHz using its call sign SAQ, which can be received all over Europe. Working principle The principle used is that of a generator (also called alternator) with an exact large number of poles is driven to an exact speed matching the number of pole changes with the desired output frequency (f = poles/2 * revolutions). The switch on and off of the transmitter with the signalling morse key makes the driver motor to change frequency just a bit, so the frequency is outside the narrow band of the antenna and thus transmitted with much less power. In fact this forms an early and clever form of frequency shift keying (FSK). In the days of construction this was the only way known how to output very high power at radio frequencies. Like turning the dynamo of a bike: a dynamo has for instance four poles and by turning this at 100 revolutions (turns) per second the output will be 200 Hertz. If the number of poles in the dynamo are increased to 80 the same driving speed will give us a 4 kHz signal. Increasing both the number of poles and the turning speed makes higher frequencies possible. Schematic diagram of principle Between points a and b there will be a signal of 15 (because of 30 poles) times the number of revolutions. The turning rod with electrical windings creating a coil will undergo a sequence of North and South magnetic poles. This induces an alternating current that presents itself on the points a and b. This presented model has fixed (stator) magnets and a rotating (rotor) coil. The places of the two can be exchanged so the magnets are turning in the centre and the coils are in a ring around it. This makes transfer of the coil signal to the next stages (tuning network and antenna) easier. Principle of a multipole generator for creating radio frequencies. Antenna system The antenna system, consisting of high voltage power lines- like antenna towers with antenna wires, has a very low efficiency due to the fact that the length of the antenna is still relatively small compared to the output wavelength.  Technical details  To achieve maximum range, like other transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations of this era it transmitted in the VLF band, at a frequency of 17.2 kilohertz and so the wavelength is approximately 17,442 meters. Even though the antenna is approximately 2 km long, it is short compared with the wavelength and so it is not very efficient. The six antenna masts each have a 46m cross-arm at the top and are 127m high. Today they carry 8 antenna conductors although originally there were 12. There are 64 windings on the stator of the alternator/generator, and each provides 100 V at up to 30 A, i.e. approximately 3 kW. Thus the peak RF output power is approximately 64 x 3 kW or 200 kW, although these days it is usually limited to about 80 kW. The rotor is a steel disc measuring 1.6 m in diameter and approximately 7.5 cm thick at the periphery. Around its circumference it has 488 brass filled slots. The air gap between the stator and rotor is 1 mm or less. The motor to drive the generator is capable of delivering 500 HP (approximately 370 kW). It is supplied by a 2,200V supply from a transformer-derived 2 phase supply, and turns at 711.3 rpm to obtain the specified frequency of operation. The complete transmitter set weighs about 50 tons.

It was one of the earliest examples of nearline storage.  History  Starting in the late-1960s IBM's lab in Boulder, Colorado began development of a low-cost mass storage system based on magnetic tape cartridges. The tapes would be accessed automatically by a robot (known as an accessor) and fed into a reader/writer unit that could work on several tapes at the same time. Originally the system was going to be used as a directly attached memory device, but as the speed of computers grew in relation to the storage, the product was re-purposed as an automated system that would offload little-used data from hard disk systems. Known internally as Comanche while under development, IBM management found a number of niche uses for the concept, and announced it officially as the IBM 3850 on October 9, 1974. After more than a decade (comparable to the IBM 2321 Data Cell, 1964-1975), it was withdrawn August 5, 1986.  Description  Data cartridge The MSS (as it was known) consisted of a library of cylindrical plastic cartridges, two inches wide and long, each holding a spool of tape long storing 50MB; each virtual disk required a pair of cartridges. These cartridges were held in a hexagonal array of bins in the IBM 3851 Mass Storage Facility. New cartridges were rolled into the facility and were automatically stored in a vacant bin. The data were accessed via virtual IBM 3330 disk drives, and physically cached on a combination of 3330 and 3350 staging drives, the data being transferred automatically between cartridge and disk drive in processes called staging and destaging. These were all connected together with the IBM 3830 Storage Control (also used for disk storage alone), the entire system making up a 3850 unit. Cartridges were moved into and out of read stations by two motorized accessor arms, electrically connected via flat cable on a drum. Stage time for data from cartridge to disk was typically 15 seconds, including about two seconds to move the cartridge into a read station, and eight to ten seconds to read the 200-foot tape. The recording method was unusual for its time. The tape was wound around a cylindrical mandrel in a helix and stopped. The drive head rotated once (on a rotating drum) to record a diagonal track. Then tape was wound a small step, so the head could iterate over next diagonal track. Depending on technical definitions this might be even considered a first example of a digital helical scan recording, long before Exabyte's helical drive (which was based on analog video helical recording systems developed earlier). When free disk space was required a group of cylinders were selected to be destaged to tape, these were transferred with minimal or no change of format. Each tape could store 202 cylinder images of 19 tracks each, half of the 404 cylinders in a 3330 disk pack. Cylinder locations on the tape were fixed and identified by markers along the edge.  Models  Several models of the 3851 were available. The smallest A1 holding 706 cartridges storing 35.3GB, while the largest A4 held 4,720 cartridges storing 236GB in a long unit. All of the units were also available in the \\"B models\\" which added a second controller for on-line backups, as well as offline storage. A second series was released on March 6, 1980, doubling maximum capacity to 472GB. The entire series was discontinued on August 5, 1986.

The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear such as Stone Island, CP Company, Lacoste, Sergio Tacchini, Fila, Fred Perry and Lyle & Scott in order to avoid the attention of police and to intimidate rivals. They did not wear club colours, so it was easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter pubs. Some casuals have worn clothing items similar to those worn by mods. Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as ID, The Firm and The Football Factory. History The designer clothing and fashion aspect of the casual subculture began in the mid-to-late 1970s. One well documented precursor was the trend of Liverpool youths starting to dress differently from other football fans ‚Äî in Peter Storm jackets, straight-leg jeans and Adidas trainers. Liverpool F.C. fans were the first British football fans to wear continental European fashions, which they picked up while following their teams at matches in Europe. The other documented precursor, according to Colin Blaney, was a subculture known as Perry Boys, which originated in the mid-1970s as a precursor to the casuals. The Perry Boys subculture consisted of Manchester football hooligans styling their hair into a flick and wearing sportswear, Fred Perry shirts and Dunlop Green Flash trainers.

Early life A native of Los Angeles, California, she is one of two daughters of businessman Marvin Solomon and actress Lugene Sanders. She is of Jewish heritage. She majored in Victorian Studies at Vassar College. Professional career She has written for The Wall Street Journal, Vogue and UK newspapers The Daily Telegraph, The Times, Evening Standard, and The Independent. She was the Communications and Marketing Director for Cond√© Nast Publications in the UK. She took her position at The Spectator in 1996. On 24 November 2006, Kimberly Quinn resigned from her post at The Spectator. She has written a series of time travel adventures for young adults; the Chronicles of the Tempus series. The first work, The Queen Must Die (2010) was followed by The Queen at War (2013). Personal life In 1987, Quinn married American investment banker Michael Fortier; the couple divorced in 2000, following revelations of her affair with Stephen Quinn, publisher of Vogue and GQ magazines. In 2001, she married Quinn; during this marriage, she had an affair with David Blunkett, Home Secretary in Tony Blair's ministry. Quinn's three- year affair with David Blunkett ended acrimoniously in mid-2004. The affair was revealed by the News of the World in August 2004, according to the prosecution in the R v Brooks, Coulson and six others trial in October 2013, after the newspaper had intercepted voicemails.Nick Davies \\"Phone-hacking trial told NoW safe held intimate details of David Blunkett affair\\" , The Guardian, 7 November 2013 During that period, Quinn gave birth to one son and became pregnant with a second child. The paternity of the two children became a matter of dispute. Blunkett's paternity of Quinn's elder child was confirmed by DNA tests. Following the end of the affair between Quinn and Blunkett, moves by him to gain informal access to the first child were rejected by Quinn, and in early December 2004 Blunkett petitioned the Family Division of the High Court to grant him legal access. Controversy around a number of matters arising from the affair, particularly concerns over the handling of the visa of Quinn's nanny, contributed to Blunkett's resignation in mid- December 2004.\\"Blunkett office 'sped nanny visa'\\" , BBC News, 21 December 2004 Shortly after Blunkett's resignation, it was revealed by the News of the World that Quinn had also had an affair with Simon Hoggart, a political journalist and regular contributor to The Spectator.

It is related to a more general concept called analytic representation,Bracewell, Ron. The Fourier Transform and Its Applications. McGraw-Hill, 1965. p269 which decomposes a sinusoid into the product of a complex constant and a factor that encapsulates the frequency and time dependence. The complex constant, which encapsulates amplitude and phase dependence, is known as phasor, complex amplitude, and (in older texts) sinor or even complexor. A common situation in electrical networks is the existence of multiple sinusoids all with the same frequency, but different amplitudes and phases. The only difference in their analytic representations is the complex amplitude (phasor). A linear combination of such functions can be factored into the product of a linear combination of phasors (known as phasor arithmetic) and the time/frequency dependent factor that they all have in common. The origin of the term phasor rightfully suggests that a (diagrammatic) calculus somewhat similar to that possible for vectors is possible for phasors as well. An important additional feature of the phasor transform is that differentiation and integration of sinusoidal signals (having constant amplitude, period and phase) corresponds to simple algebraic operations on the phasors; the phasor transform thus allows the analysis (calculation) of the AC steady state of RLC circuits by solving simple algebraic equations (albeit with complex coefficients) in the phasor domain instead of solving differential equations (with real coefficients) in the time domain. The originator of the phasor transform was Charles Proteus Steinmetz working at General Electric in the late 19th century. Glossing over some mathematical details, the phasor transform can also be seen as a particular case of the Laplace transform, which additionally can be used to (simultaneously) derive the transient response of an RLC circuit. However, the Laplace transform is mathematically more difficult to apply and the effort may be unjustified if only steady state analysis is required. Fig 2. When function \\\\scriptstyle A\\\\cdot e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta)} is depicted in the complex plane, the vector formed by its imaginary and real parts rotates around the origin. Its magnitude is A, and it completes one cycle every 2/œâ seconds. Œ∏ is the angle it forms with the real axis at t = n‚Ä¢2/œâ, for integer values of n. Notation Phasor notation (also known as angle notation) is a mathematical notation used in electronics engineering and electrical engineering. 1\\\\angle \\\\theta can represent either the vector (\\\\cos \\\\theta, \\\\sin \\\\theta)\\\\, or the complex number \\\\cos \\\\theta + j \\\\sin \\\\theta = e^{j\\\\theta}, with j^2 = -1, both of which have magnitudes of 1. A vector whose polar coordinates are magnitude A and angle \\\\theta is written A \\\\angle \\\\theta., Chapter 9, page 338 The angle may be stated in degrees with an implied conversion from degrees to radians. For example 1\\\\angle 90 would be assumed to be 1\\\\angle 90^\\\\circ, which is the vector (0,1)\\\\, or the number e^{j\\\\pi/2}.\\\\, Definition Euler's formula indicates that sinusoids can be represented mathematically as the sum of two complex-valued functions: :A\\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta) = A \\\\cdot \\\\frac{e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta)} + e^{-i(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta)}}{2}, or as the real part of one of the functions: : \\\\begin{align} A\\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta) = \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{ A\\\\cdot e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta)}\\\\\\\\}= \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{ A e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} The function A\\\\cdot e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta)} is called the analytic representation of A\\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta). Figure 2 depicts it as a rotating vector in a complex plane. It is sometimes convenient to refer to the entire function as a phasor, as we do in the next section. But the term phasor usually implies just the static vector A e^{i\\\\theta}. Arithmetic =Multiplication by a constant (scalar)= Multiplication of the phasor A e^{i\\\\theta} e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\, by a complex constant, B e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\, , produces another phasor. That means its only effect is to change the amplitude and phase of the underlying sinusoid: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\\\\\{(A e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\cdot B e^{i\\\\phi})\\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\\\} &= \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\\\\\{(AB e^{i(\\\\theta+\\\\phi)})\\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= A B \\\\cos(\\\\omega t +(\\\\theta+\\\\phi)) \\\\end{align} In electronics, B e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\, would represent an impedance, which is independent of time. In particular it is not the shorthand notation for another phasor. Multiplying a phasor current by an impedance produces a phasor voltage. But the product of two phasors (or squaring a phasor) would represent the product of two sinusoids, which is a non-linear operation that produces new frequency components. Phasor notation can only represent systems with one frequency, such as a linear system stimulated by a sinusoid. = Addition = The sum of phasors as addition of rotating vectorsThe sum of multiple phasors produces another phasor. That is because the sum of sinusoids with the same frequency is also a sinusoid with that frequency: : \\\\begin{align} A_1 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta_1) + A_2 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta_2) &= \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{A_1 e^{i\\\\theta_1}e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} + \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{A_2 e^{i\\\\theta_2}e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{A_1 e^{i\\\\theta_1}e^{i\\\\omega t} + A_2 e^{i\\\\theta_2}e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{(A_1 e^{i\\\\theta_1} + A_2 e^{i\\\\theta_2})e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{(A_3 e^{i\\\\theta_3})e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] &= A_3 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta_3), \\\\end{align} where : A_3^2 = (A_1 \\\\cos\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\cos \\\\theta_2)^2 + (A_1 \\\\sin\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\sin\\\\theta_2)^2, :and, if we take \\\\theta_3 \\\\in [-\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{2}; \\\\tfrac{3\\\\pi}{2}], then : :* if A_1 \\\\cos\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\cos\\\\theta_2 = 0, then \\\\theta_3 = \\\\sgn(A_1 \\\\sin(\\\\theta_1) + A_2 \\\\sin(\\\\theta_2)) * \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}, with \\\\sgn the sign function; :* if A_1 \\\\cos\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\cos\\\\theta_2 > 0, then \\\\theta_3 = \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{A_1 \\\\sin\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\sin\\\\theta_2}{A_1 \\\\cos\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\cos\\\\theta_2}\\\\right) ; :* if A_1 \\\\cos\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\cos\\\\theta_2 < 0, then \\\\theta_3 = \\\\pi + \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{A_1 \\\\sin\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\sin\\\\theta_2}{A_1 \\\\cos\\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\cos\\\\theta_2}\\\\right) . or, via the law of cosines on the complex plane (or the trigonometric identity for angle differences): : A_3^2 = A_1^2 + A_2^2 - 2 A_1 A_2 \\\\cos(180^\\\\circ - \\\\Delta\\\\theta) = A_1^2 + A_2^2 + 2 A_1 A_2 \\\\cos(\\\\Delta\\\\theta), where \\\\Delta\\\\theta = \\\\theta_1 - \\\\theta_2. A key point is that A3 and Œ∏3 do not depend on œâ or t, which is what makes phasor notation possible. The time and frequency dependence can be suppressed and re- inserted into the outcome as long as the only operations used in between are ones that produce another phasor. In angle notation, the operation shown above is written :A_1 \\\\angle \\\\theta_1 + A_2 \\\\angle \\\\theta_2 = A_3 \\\\angle \\\\theta_3. \\\\, Another way to view addition is that two vectors with coordinates and are added vectorially to produce a resultant vector with coordinates . (see animation) Phasor diagram of three waves in perfect destructive interference In physics, this sort of addition occurs when sinusoids interfere with each other, constructively or destructively. The static vector concept provides useful insight into questions like this: \\"What phase difference would be required between three identical sinusoids for perfect cancellation?\\" In this case, simply imagine taking three vectors of equal length and placing them head to tail such that the last head matches up with the first tail. Clearly, the shape which satisfies these conditions is an equilateral triangle, so the angle between each phasor to the next is 120¬∞ ( radians), or one third of a wavelength . So the phase difference between each wave must also be 120¬∞, as is the case in three-phase power In other words, what this shows is that :\\\\cos(\\\\omega t) + \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + 2\\\\pi/3) + \\\\cos(\\\\omega t -2\\\\pi/3) = 0.\\\\, In the example of three waves, the phase difference between the first and the last wave was 240 degrees, while for two waves destructive interference happens at 180 degrees. In the limit of many waves, the phasors must form a circle for destructive interference, so that the first phasor is nearly parallel with the last. This means that for many sources, destructive interference happens when the first and last wave differ by 360 degrees, a full wavelength \\\\lambda. This is why in single slit diffraction, the minima occur when light from the far edge travels a full wavelength further than the light from the near edge. As the single vector rotates in an anti-clockwise direction, its tip at point A will rotate one complete revolution of 360¬∞ or 2 radians representing one complete cycle. If the length of its moving tip is transferred at different angular intervals in time to a graph as shown above, a sinusoidal waveform would be drawn starting at the left with zero time. Each position along the horizontal axis indicates the time that has elapsed since zero time, t = 0\\\\. When the vector is horizontal the tip of the vector represents the angles at 0¬∞, 180¬∞, and at 360¬∞. Likewise, when the tip of the vector is vertical it represents the positive peak value, ( +Amax ) at 90¬∞ or and the negative peak value, ( ‚àíAmax ) at 270¬∞ or . Then the time axis of the waveform represents the angle either in degrees or radians through which the phasor has moved. So we can say that a phasor represent a scaled voltage or current value of a rotating vector which is ‚Äúfrozen‚Äù at some point in time, ( t ) and in our example above, this is at an angle of 30¬∞. Sometimes when we are analysing alternating waveforms we may need to know the position of the phasor, representing the alternating quantity at some particular instant in time especially when we want to compare two different waveforms on the same axis. For example, voltage and current. We have assumed in the waveform above that the waveform starts at time t = 0 with a corresponding phase angle in either degrees or radians. But if a second waveform starts to the left or to the right of this zero point, or if we want to represent in phasor notation the relationship between the two waveforms, then we will need to take into account this phase difference, of the waveform. Consider the diagram below from the previous Phase Difference tutorial. = Differentiation and integration = The time derivative or integral of a phasor produces another phasor.{\\\\mathrm{d} t}(e^{i \\\\omega t}) = i \\\\omega e^{i \\\\omega t}, which means that the complex exponential is the eigenfunction of the derivative operation. }} For example: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d} t}(A e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t})\\\\right\\\\\\\\}= \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\\\\\{A e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\cdot i\\\\omega e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\\\\\{A e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\pi/2} \\\\omega e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\\\\\{\\\\omega A e^{i(\\\\theta + \\\\pi/2)} \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} = \\\\omega A\\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta + \\\\pi/2) \\\\end{align} Therefore, in phasor representation, the time derivative of a sinusoid becomes just multiplication by the constant i \\\\omega = (e^{i\\\\pi/2} \\\\cdot \\\\omega)\\\\,. Similarly, integrating a phasor corresponds to multiplication by \\\\frac{1}{i\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{e^{-i\\\\pi/2}}{\\\\omega}\\\\,. The time-dependent factor, e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\,, is unaffected. When we solve a linear differential equation with phasor arithmetic, we are merely factoring e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\, out of all terms of the equation, and reinserting it into the answer. For example, consider the following differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor in an RC circuit: :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ v_C(t)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} + \\\\frac{1}{RC}v_C(t) = \\\\frac{1}{RC}v_S(t) When the voltage source in this circuit is sinusoidal: :v_S(t) = V_P\\\\cdot \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta),\\\\, we may substitute \\\\begin{align} v_S(t) &= \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{V_s \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} :v_C(t) = \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\}, where phasor V_s = V_P e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\,, and phasor V_c\\\\, is the unknown quantity to be determined. In the phasor shorthand notation, the differential equation reduces to :i \\\\omega V_c + \\\\frac{1}{RC} V_c = \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_s Since this must hold for all t\\\\,, specifically: t - \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\omega }\\\\,, it follows that {\\\\mathrm{d}t} + \\\\frac{1}{RC}\\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\\\\\{V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{RC}\\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\\\\\{V_s \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\} }} It is also readily seen that :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\\\\\{V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\left( V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\right)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ i\\\\omega V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\\\\\{V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\\\\\}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\left( V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\right)}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\operatorname{Im} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ i\\\\omega V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Substituting these into and , multiplying by i,\\\\, and adding both equations gives :i\\\\omega V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} + \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} = \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} :\\\\left(i\\\\omega V_c + \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_c \\\\right) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_s\\\\right) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} :i\\\\omega V_c + \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_c = \\\\frac{1}{RC}V_s \\\\quad\\\\quad(\\\\mathrm{QED}) }} Solving for the phasor capacitor voltage gives : V_c = \\\\frac{1}{1 + i \\\\omega RC} \\\\cdot (V_s) = \\\\frac{1-i\\\\omega R C}{1+(\\\\omega R C)^2} \\\\cdot (V_P e^{i\\\\theta})\\\\, As we have seen, the factor multiplying V_s\\\\, represents differences of the amplitude and phase of v_C(t)\\\\, relative to V_P\\\\, and \\\\theta\\\\,. In polar coordinate form, it is :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + (\\\\omega RC)^2}}\\\\cdot e^{-i \\\\phi(\\\\omega)},\\\\text{ where }\\\\phi(\\\\omega) = \\\\arctan(\\\\omega RC).\\\\, Therefore :v_C(t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1 + (\\\\omega RC)^2}}\\\\cdot V_P \\\\cos(\\\\omega t + \\\\theta- \\\\phi(\\\\omega))  Applications  = Circuit laws = With phasors, the techniques for solving DC circuits can be applied to solve AC circuits. A list of the basic laws is given below. * Ohm's law for resistors: a resistor has no time delays and therefore doesn't change the phase of a signal therefore V=IR remains valid. * Ohm's law for resistors, inductors, and capacitors: V = IZ where Z is the complex impedance. * In an AC circuit we have real power (P) which is a representation of the average power into the circuit and reactive power (Q) which indicates power flowing back and forth. We can also define the complex power S = P + jQ and the apparent power which is the magnitude of S. The power law for an AC circuit expressed in phasors is then S = VI* (where I* is the complex conjugate of I, and the magnitudes of the voltage and current phasors V and I are the RMS values of the voltage and current, respectively). * Kirchhoff's circuit laws work with phasors in complex form Given this we can apply the techniques of analysis of resistive circuits with phasors to analyze single frequency AC circuits containing resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Multiple frequency linear AC circuits and AC circuits with different waveforms can be analyzed to find voltages and currents by transforming all waveforms to sine wave components with magnitude and phase then analyzing each frequency separately, as allowed by the superposition theorem. This solution method applies only to inputs that are sinusoidal and for solutions that are in steady state, i.e., after all transients have died out. The concept is frequently involved in representing an electrical impedance. In this case, the phase angle is the phase difference between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it. =Power engineering= In analysis of three phase AC power systems, usually a set of phasors is defined as the three complex cube roots of unity, graphically represented as unit magnitudes at angles of 0, 120 and 240 degrees. By treating polyphase AC circuit quantities as phasors, balanced circuits can be simplified and unbalanced circuits can be treated as an algebraic combination of symmetrical components. This approach greatly simplifies the work required in electrical calculations of voltage drop, power flow, and short-circuit currents. In the context of power systems analysis, the phase angle is often given in degrees, and the magnitude in rms value rather than the peak amplitude of the sinusoid. The technique of synchrophasors uses digital instruments to measure the phasors representing transmission system voltages at widespread points in a transmission network. Differences among the phasors indicate power flow and system stability. = Telecommunications: analog modulations = The rotating frame picture using phasor can be a powerful tool to understand analog modulations such as amplitude modulation (and its variants de Oliveira, H.M. and Nunes, F.D.

A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make \\"almost anything\\". This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production. While fab labs have yet to compete with mass production and its associated economies of scale in fabricating widely distributed products, they have already shown the potential to empower individuals to create smart devices for themselves. These devices can be tailored to local or personal needs in ways that are not practical or economical using mass production. The fab lab movement is closely aligned with the DIY movement, open-source hardware, maker culture, and the free and open- source movement, and shares philosophy as well as technology with them.  History  The fab lab program was initiated to broadly explore how the content of information relates to its physical representation and how an under-served community can be powered by technology at the grassroots level. The program began as a collaboration between the Grassroots Invention Group and the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Media Lab in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a grant from the National Science Foundation (Washington, D.C.) in 2001. Vigyan Ashram in India was the first fab lab to be set up outside MIT. It is established in 2002 and received capital equipment by NSF-USA and IITK While the Grassroots Invention Group is no longer in the Media Lab, The Center for Bits and Atoms consortium is still actively involved in continuing research in areas related to description and fabrication but does not operate or maintain any of the labs worldwide (with the excmobile fab lab). The fab lab concept also grew out of a popular class at MIT (MAS.863) named \\"How To Make (Almost) Anything\\". The class is still offered in the fall semesters.  Popular equipment and projects  Flexible manufacturing equipment within a fab lab can include: * Mainly, a rapid prototyper: typically a 3D printer of plastic or plaster parts * 3-axis CNC machines: 3 or more axes, computer-controlled subtractive milling or turning machines * Printed circuit board milling or etching: two-dimensional, high precision milling to create circuit traces in pre-clad copper boards * Microprocessor and digital electronics design, assembly, and test stations * Cutters, for sheet material: laser cutter, plasma cutter, water jet cutter, knife cutter.  FabFi  One of the larger projects undertaken by fab labs include free community FabFi wireless networks (in Afghanistan, Kenya and US). The first city-scale FabFi network, set up in Afghanistan, has remained in place and active for three years under community supervision and with no special maintenance. The network in Kenya, (Based in the University of Nairobi (UoN)) building on that experience, started to experiment with controlling service quality and providing added services for a fee to make the network cost- neutral.  Fab Academy  Fab Academy leverages the Fab Lab network to teach hands-on, digital fabrication skills. Students convene at Fab Lab \\"Supernodes\\" for the 19 week course to earn a diploma and build a portfolio. In some cases, the diploma is accredited or offers academic credit. The curriculum is based on MIT's rapid prototyping course MAS 863: How to Make (Almost) Anything. The course is estimated to cost US$5000, but varies with location and available scholarship opportunities. All course materials are publicly archived online here.  Fab City  Fab City has been set up to explore innovative ways of creating the city of the future. It focuses on transforming and shaping the way how materials are sourced and used. This transformation should lead to a shift in the urban model from 'PITO to DIDO' that is, 'product-in, trash-out' to, data-in, data-out'https://fab.city/uploads/whitepaper.pdf. This can eventually transform cities into self-sufficient entities in 2054; in line with the pledge that Barcelona has made. The Fab City links to the fab lab movement, because they make use of the same human capital. The Fab cities make use of the innovative spirit of the users of the fab labs.  Green Fab Labs  The Green Fab Lab Network, which started in Catalonia's Green Fablab, is made up of fablabs that embrace the concepts of an open source symbiotic economy and the circular economy through green entrepreneurship. For example, they promote distributed recycling, where locals recycled their plastic waste turning locally sourced shredded plastic into items of value with fused particle fabrication/ fused granular fabrication (FPF/FGF) 3D printing, which not only is a good economic but also a good environmental option.  List of labs  MIT maintained a listing of all official Fab Labs, worldwide, until 2014. Nowadays listing of all official Fab Labs is maintained by the community through website fablabs.io. As of November 2019, there existed 1830 Fab Labs in the world in total.Fab Lab List Currently there are Fab Labs on every continent except Antarctica.

The theory is most developed for direct integrals of Hilbert spaces and direct integrals of von Neumann algebras. The concept was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann in one of the papers in the series On Rings of Operators. One of von Neumann's goals in this paper was to reduce the classification of (what are now called) von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces to the classification of so-called factors. Factors are analogous to full matrix algebras over a field, and von Neumann wanted to prove a continuous analogue of the Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem classifying semi- simple rings. Results on direct integrals can be viewed as generalizations of results about finite-dimensional C*-algebras of matrices; in this case the results are easy to prove directly. The infinite-dimensional case is complicated by measure-theoretic technicalities. Direct integral theory was also used by George Mackey in his analysis of systems of imprimitivity and his general theory of induced representations of locally compact separable groups.  Direct integrals of Hilbert spaces  The simplest example of a direct integral are the L2 spaces associated to a (œÉ-finite) countably additive measure Œº on a measurable space X. Somewhat more generally one can consider a separable Hilbert space H and the space of square-integrable H-valued functions : L^2_\\\\mu(X, H). Terminological note: The terminology adopted by the literature on the subject is followed here, according to which a measurable space X is referred to as a Borel space and the elements of the distinguished œÉ-algebra of X as Borel sets, regardless of whether or not the underlying œÉ-algebra comes from a topological space (in most examples it does). A Borel space is standard if and only if it is isomorphic to the underlying Borel space of a Polish space; all Polish spaces of a given cardinality are isomorphic to each other (as Borel spaces). Given a countably additive measure Œº on X, a measurable set is one that differs from a Borel set by a null set. The measure Œº on X is a standard measure if and only if there is a null set E such that its complement X ‚àí E is a standard Borel space. All measures considered here are œÉ-finite. Definition. Let X be a Borel space equipped with a countably additive measure Œº. A measurable family of Hilbert spaces on (X, Œº) is a family {Hx}x‚àà X, which is locally equivalent to a trivial family in the following sense: There is a countable partition : \\\\\\\\{X_n\\\\\\\\}_{1 \\\\leq n \\\\leq \\\\omega} by measurable subsets of X such that : H_x = \\\\mathbf{H}_n \\\\quad x \\\\in X_n where Hn is the canonical n-dimensional Hilbert space, that is : \\\\mathbf{H}_n = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathbb{C}^n & \\\\mbox{ if } n < \\\\omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ell^2 & \\\\mbox{ if } n = \\\\omega \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. A cross-section of {Hx}x‚àà X is a family {sx}x ‚àà X such that sx ‚àà Hx for all x ‚àà X. A cross-section is measurable if and only if its restriction to each partition element Xn is measurable. We will identify measurable cross-sections s, t that are equal almost everywhere. Given a measurable family of Hilbert spaces, the direct integral : \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X H_x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu(x) consists of equivalence classes (with respect to almost everywhere equality) of measurable square integrable cross-sections of {Hx}x‚àà X. This is a Hilbert space under the inner product : \\\\langle s  t \\\\rangle = \\\\int_X \\\\langle s(x)  t(x) \\\\rangle \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu(x) Given the local nature of our definition, many definitions applicable to single Hilbert spaces apply to measurable families of Hilbert spaces as well. Remark. This definition is apparently more restrictive than the one given by von Neumann and discussed in Dixmier's classic treatise on von Neumann algebras. In the more general definition, the Hilbert space fibers Hx are allowed to vary from point to point without having a local triviality requirement (local in a measure-theoretic sense). One of the main theorems of the von Neumann theory is to show that in fact the more general definition can be reduced to the simpler one given here. Note that the direct integral of a measurable family of Hilbert spaces depends only on the measure class of the measure Œº; more precisely: Theorem. Suppose Œº, ŒΩ are œÉ-finite countably additive measures on X that have the same sets of measure 0. Then the mapping : s \\\\mapsto \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu}{\\\\mathrm{d} u}\\\\right)^{1/2} s is a unitary operator : \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X H_x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X H_x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} u(x). = Example = Technically the simplest examples are when X is a countable set and Œº is a discrete measure. Throughout the article, we will consider the following running example in which X = N and Œº is counting measure on N. In this case any sequence {Hk} of separable Hilbert spaces can be considered as a measurable family. Moreover, : \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X H_x \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu(x) \\\\cong \\\\bigoplus_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} H_k  Decomposable operators  In our running example, any bounded linear operator T on : H = \\\\bigoplus_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} H_k is given by an infinite matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix} T_{1 1} & T_{1 2} & \\\\cdots & T_{1 n} & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{2 1} & T_{2 2} & \\\\cdots & T_{2 n} & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ T_{n 1} & T_{n 2} & \\\\cdots & T_{n n} & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\end{bmatrix}. Consider operators that are block diagonal, that is all entries off the diagonal are zero. We call these operators decomposable. These operators can be characterized as those that commute with diagonal matrices: : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\lambda_{1} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_{2} & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\lambda_{n} & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\cdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\end{bmatrix}. We now proceed to the general definition: A family of bounded operators {Tx}x‚àà X with Tx ‚àà L(Hx) is said to be strongly measurable if and only if its restriction to each Xn is strongly measurable. This makes sense because Hx is constant on Xn. Measurable families of operators with an essentially bounded norm, that is : \\\\operatorname{ess-sup}_{x \\\\in X} \\\\T_x\\\\ < \\\\infty define bounded linear operators : \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X \\\\ T_x d \\\\mu(x) \\\\in \\\\operatorname{L}\\\\bigg(\\\\int^\\\\oplus_X H_x \\\\ d \\\\mu(x)\\\\bigg) acting in a pointwise fashion, that is : \\\\bigg[\\\\int^\\\\oplus_X \\\\ T_x d \\\\mu(x) \\\\bigg] \\\\bigg(\\\\int^\\\\oplus_X \\\\ s_x d \\\\mu(x) \\\\bigg) = \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X \\\\ T_x(s_x) d \\\\mu(x). Such operators are said to be decomposable. Examples of decomposable operators are those defined by scalar-valued (i.e. C-valued) measurable functions Œª on X. In fact, Theorem. The mapping : \\\\phi: L^\\\\infty_\\\\mu(X) \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{L}\\\\bigg(\\\\int^\\\\oplus_X H_x \\\\ d \\\\mu(x)\\\\bigg) given by : \\\\lambda \\\\mapsto \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X \\\\ \\\\lambda_x d \\\\mu(x) is an involutive algebraic isomorphism onto its image. For this reason we will identify L‚àûŒº(X) with the image of œÜ. Theorem, Chapter IV, Theorem 7.10, p. 259 Decomposable operators are precisely those that are in the operator commutant of the abelian algebra L‚àûŒº(X). = Decomposition of Abelian von Neumann algebras = The spectral theorem has many variants. A particularly powerful version is as follows: Theorem. For any Abelian von Neumann algebra A on a separable Hilbert space H, there is a standard Borel space X and a measure Œº on X such that it is unitarily equivalent as an operator algebra to L‚àûŒº(X) acting on a direct integral of Hilbert spaces : \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H_x d \\\\mu(x). \\\\quad To assert A is unitarily equivalent to L‚àûŒº(X) as an operator algebra means that there is a unitary : U: H \\\\rightarrow \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H_x d\\\\mu(x) such that U A U* is the algebra of diagonal operators L‚àûŒº(X). Note that this asserts more than just the algebraic equivalence of A with the algebra of diagonal operators. This version however does not explicitly state how the underlying standard Borel space X is obtained. There is a uniqueness result for the above decomposition. Theorem. If the Abelian von Neumann algebra A is unitarily equivalent to both L‚àûŒº(X) and L‚àûŒΩ(Y) acting on the direct integral spaces : \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H_x d \\\\mu(x), \\\\quad \\\\int_Y^\\\\oplus K_y d u(y) and Œº, ŒΩ are standard measures, then there is a Borel isomorphism :\\\\varphi: X - E \\\\rightarrow Y - F where E, F are null sets such that : K_{\\\\phi(x)} = H_x \\\\quad \\\\mbox{almost everywhere} œÜ is a measure class isomorphism, that is œÜ and its inverse preserve sets of measure 0. This previous two theorems provide the complete classification of Abelian von Neumann algebras on separable Hilbert spaces. Note that this classification actually takes into account the realization of the von Neumann algebra as an algebra of operators. If we only consider the underlying von Neumann algebra independently of its realization as a von Neumann algebra, then its structure is determined by very simple measure-theoretic invariants.  Direct integrals of von Neumann algebras  Let {Hx}x ‚àà X be a measurable family of Hilbert spaces. A family of von Neumann algebras {Ax}x ‚àà X with : A_x \\\\subseteq \\\\operatorname{L}(H_x) is measurable if and only if there is a countable set D of measurable operator families that pointwise generate {Ax} x ‚àà Xas a von Neumann algebra in the following sense: For almost all x ‚àà X, : \\\\operatorname{W^*}(\\\\\\\\{S_x: S \\\\in D\\\\\\\\}) = A_x where W*(S) denotes the von Neumann algebra generated by the set S. If {Ax}x ‚àà X is a measurable family of von Neumann algebras, the direct integral of von Neumann algebras : \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus A_x d\\\\mu(x) consists of all operators of the form : \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus T_x d\\\\mu(x) for Tx ‚àà Ax. One of the main theorems of von Neumann and Murray in their original series of papers is a proof of the decomposition theorem: Any von Neumann algebra is a direct integral of factors. We state this precisely below. Theorem. If {Ax}x ‚àà X is a measurable family of von Neumann algebras and Œº is standard, then the family of operator commutants is also measurable and : \\\\bigg[\\\\int_X^\\\\oplus A_x d\\\\mu(x)\\\\bigg]' = \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus A'_x d\\\\mu(x).  Central decomposition  Suppose A is a von Neumann algebra. let Z(A) be the center of A, that is the set of operators in A that commute with all operators A, that is : \\\\mathbf{Z}(A) = A \\\\cap A' Z(A) is an Abelian von Neumann algebra. Example. The center of L(H) is 1-dimensional. In general, if A is a von Neumann algebra, if the center is 1-dimensional we say A is a factor. Now suppose A is a von Neumann algebra whose center contains a sequence of minimal pairwise orthogonal non-zero projections {Ei}i ‚àà N such that : 1 = \\\\sum_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} E_i Then A Ei is a von Neumann algebra on the range Hi of Ei. It is easy to see A Ei is a factor. Thus in this special case : A = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} A E_i represents A as a direct sum of factors. This is a special case of the central decomposition theorem of von Neumann. In general, we can apply the structure theorem of Abelian von Neumann algebras that represents Z(A) as an algebra of scalar diagonal operators. In any such representation, all the operators in A are decomposable operators. In fact, we can use this to prove the basic result of von Neumann that any von Neumann algebra admits a decomposition into factors. Theorem. Suppose : H = \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus H_x d \\\\mu(x) is a direct integral decomposition of H and A is a von Neumann algebra on H so that Z(A) is represented by the algebra of scalar diagonal operators L‚àûŒº(X) where X is a standard Borel space. Then : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\int^\\\\oplus_X A_x d \\\\mu(x) where for almost all x ‚àà X, Ax is a von Neumann algebra that is a factor.  Measurable families of representations  If A is a separable C*-algebra, we can consider measurable families of non-degenerate *-representations of A; recall that in case A has a unit, non-degeneracy is equivalent to unit- preserving. By the general correspondence that exists between strongly continuous unitary representations of a locally compact group G and non- degenerate *-representations of the groups C*-algebra C*(G), the theory for C*-algebras immediately provides a decomposition theory for representations of separable locally compact groups. Theorem. Let A be a separable C*-algebra and œÄ a non-degenerate involutive representation of A on a separable Hilbert space H. Let W*(œÄ) be the von Neumann algebra generated by the operators œÄ(a) for a ‚àà A. Then corresponding to any central decomposition of W*(œÄ) over a standard measure space (X, Œº) (which as stated is unique in a measure theoretic sense), there is a measurable family of factor representations : \\\\\\\\{\\\\pi_x\\\\\\\\}_{x \\\\in X} of A such that : \\\\pi(a) = \\\\int_X^\\\\oplus \\\\pi_x(a) d \\\\mu(x), \\\\quad \\\\forall a \\\\in A. Moreover, there is a subset N of X with Œº measure zero, such that œÄx, œÄy are disjoint whenever x, y ‚àà X ‚àí N, where representations are said to be disjoint if and only if there are no intertwining operators between them. One can show that the direct integral can be indexed on the so-called quasi- spectrum Q of A, consisting of quasi-equivalence classes of factor representations of A. Thus there is a standard measure Œº on Q and a measurable family of factor representations indexed on Q such that œÄx belongs to the class of x. This decomposition is essentially unique. This result is fundamental in the theory of group representations.  References  * J. Dixmier, Von Neumann algebras, * J. Dixmier, C* algebras * G. W.

It is commonly accepted to have started with the historical book, Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya, written in 1762 by Paisius, a Bulgarian monk of the Hilandar monastery at Mount Athos, and lasted until the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 as a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. Characteristics The period is remarkable for its characteristic architecture which can still be observed in old Bulgarian towns such as Tryavna, Koprivshtitsa and Veliko Tarnovo, the rich literary heritage of authors like Ivan Vazov and Hristo Botev that inspired the Bulgarian struggle for independence and an autonomous church, and the April Uprising, a significant event of armed opposition to Ottoman rule, which ultimately led to the Russo-Turkish Liberation War of 1877-78. The significant changes in the Bulgarian society, the freedom of economic initiative and religious choice led to the formation of the Bulgarian nation in its ethnic borders and common territory embracing the lands of Moesia (including Dobruja), Thrace and Macedonia. The Bulgarian National Revival is traditionally divided into three periods, the first from the 18th until the beginning of the 19th century, the second from the Ottoman reforms of the 1820s to the 1850s until the Crimean War, and the third from the Crimean War until the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878. The beginning of the Bulgarian National Revival has been a topic of intensified discussion in the past. According to contemporaries of the period, it began in the 1820s. Later Marin Drinov suggested the actual beginning was marked by the writing of Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya by Paisius of Hilendar. According to an even later assumption by Hristo Gandev, the period began in the beginning of the 17th century after the end of the K√∂pr√ºl√º era and the beginning of the Tulip period and the rule of the Phanarites. The prevailing opinion in contemporary historiography is that the Bulgarian National Revival's beginning is marked by the first clear processes of decomposition in the Ottoman Empire.

Although most of his time as a Knesset member was spent with Likud, he also led the breakaway Gesher faction, which formed part of Ehud Barak's Labor-led government between 1999 and 2001. Biography David Levy was born in Rabat, Morocco. He immigrated to Israel in 1957. His first jobs in Israel were planting trees for the Jewish National Fund and picking cotton on a kibbutz, where he organized a strike to protest the quality of drinking water for the workers.Jewish Virtual Library, David Levy He went on to become a leader of Beit She'an's working- class population. As a union activist, he campaigned for membership in the Histadrut Labour Federation's executive body, which was dominated by loyalists of the governing Mapai. Levy headed the opposition Blue-White faction. David Levy is married and the father of twelve children,David Levy, bio, Ministry of Foreign Affairs including politician Orly Levy. Political career Until 1973 Likud had been an alliance of the right-wing Herut and centrist Liberal parties known as Gahal, which had never had an active role in governing Israel and had always been a weak opposition. Levy distinguished himself as the first of many young working-class members of the party from a Mizrahi (Oriental) background. Until then Herut and the Liberals had been both dominated by right-wing upper-class or upper-middle-class intellectuals, businessmen, agriculturalists, or lawyers. Levy with brother Maxim Levy, c. 1988 Levy's rise expressed the surging power of the new rebellion of the Mizrahi Israeli. In 1977, Levy became one of the most strident campaigners in Likud leader Menachem Begin's triumphant campaign that overturned the 30-year domination of Israeli elections by parties of the left. He drove hundreds of thousands of Mizrahi voters to the polls to vote for Begin, whose populist messages struck a chord in their hearts after the three decades of almost completely Ashkenazic Mapai hegemony. Ministerial positions Levy at Sadat Legacy Conference, 2017 From 1977 until 1981, Levy was Minister of Immigrant Absorption in the first two Begin governments. At this time the largest issues he dealt with during his tenure in that ministry were the campaign to liberate Soviet Jews confined to the USSR, and the controversy over the Beta Israel, a group from Ethiopia that had still not received total recognition as Jews at that time. Levy's more important role in government began during the formation of Begin's rightist government when the Democratic Movement for Change resigned. On 15 January 1979 he was given the Ministry of Housing and Construction, a post he invested a great deal of time in. Levy held the ministry until 1990, and his policies are controversial for their repeated concessions to the settler movements, which the opposition Labour Party branded pure politicking. As Housing Minister Levy was able to make housing more affordable (radical inflation in 1984 produced a crisis as property and rent values plummeted along with the Israeli shekels). While rival Likud members like Defence Minister Ariel Sharon and Health Minister Ehud Olmert were hit by controversies regarding abuse of their positions, and repeated finance ministers fell, Levy remained stable in the Housing Ministry. Through the governments of Begin, Yitzhak Shamir, and Shimon Peres he remained untouchable. Levy was the symbolic leader of the young Mizrahi Likud leaders that included former Kiryat Malakhi mayor Moshe Katzav, later President of Israel, and David Magen, mayor of neighbouring Kiryat Gat. In the Likud Central Committee, Levy commanded a huge portion of the members, and was considered a true candidate to succeed Shamir. In 1987, he met Benjamin Netanyahu, then the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. Levy viewed Netanyahu as a potential spokesman for him in the Knesset, as he was viewed as a master at rhetoric and debating during his career as a diplomat. Netanyahu turned down Levy's offer and became a nominal ally of then-Defense Minister Moshe Arens (his former boss when Arens was Ambassador to the United States in the early 1980s). Levy's career was harmed by his perceived pompousnessand shifting policies in regards to the peace process. Levy, who speaks Hebrew, French, and Moroccan Arabic, was not fluent in English, which became an impediment in talks with the Americans. Levy's candidacy was supposed to rejuvenate the Likud's Mizrahi voting base, and form a hawkish working class opposition to Labour. Levy's policies on the peace question was moderate relative to Ariel Sharon, Moshe Arens, and almost all other senior Likud figures. Meeting with U.S. Ambassador Dan Shapiro in Beit She'an, 2011 Again he ran parallel to Benjamin Netanyahu. At that time, right-wing Israelis were launching a long opposition plan to the new prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin (Labour). Netanyahu took a hard-line stand, describing a doomsday scenario of terror at the doorstep of every Israeli. Levy refused to accept Netanyahu as the new Likud chairman. The result was the establishment of Gesher (\\"Bridge\\"), Levy's own political party. Levy believed he could draw a mass defection from the Likud of parliament members, and such a disaster would lead senior party members in the Central Committee into a panic that would topple Benjamin Netanyahu. What instead occurred was that only David Magen, a Moroccan politician and former mayor of Kiryat Gat who served as Minister of Economics and Planning in the last Shamir government, broke with the Likud. Though many of Gesher's members were derided by the press as lackeys of Levy, Magen later broke with Levy to join the Center Party in 1998 (then known as \\"Israel in the Center\\"). By Winter 1996, Levy was beginning to break under the stress of his first election campaign outside of the Likud. Since the 4 November 1995 murder of Rabin, Netanyahu was frantically trying to moderate his image from a hard- line demagogue into a skeptic who wanted to slow the pace of concessions to PLO leader Yasser Arafat. Levy's inclusion would somewhat bring him closer to that goal without forcing him to take a clear stand in favour of the Oslo Accords. The opposition leader was trying to bridge the gap by recruiting the hard-line Tzomet (\\"Junction\\") party of Gen. Rafael Eitan on the right, as well as the moderate right-wing Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai in the center. Throughout the spring, Netanyahu and Levy held negotiations, and in the end Levy agreed to establish Likud‚ÄìGesher‚ÄìTzomet, a joint three-party list for the May 1996 elections. Though the broad-based coalition at the end of the outgoing Knesset included 37 members (three Tzomet members defected earlier to join Rabin's government) even threatened Labour, which had lost two members to Avigdor Kahalani's The Third Way, a group opposed to any compromise on the Golan Heights. Though a massive success for Netanyahu, the 1996 elections gained little for Levy in terms of power within Likud‚ÄìGesher‚ÄìTzomet. The real no. 2 leader in the Likud was now Mordechai, and the right-wing character of the government was clear from the start. Levy also demanded the Foreign Ministry, which he received, even without being blunted by a deputy. He believed that this way he could remain totally in control of the ministry, but instead he was again overshadowed by Netanyahu, who controlled almost every important foreign policy decision during his term. David Magen was given the post of Deputy Minister of Finance, under Prof. Yuval Ne'eman. The Bar-On Affair, an attempt to alter the investigation of Shas leader Aryeh Deri, created tension amongst the partners. On 6 January 1998 David Levy quit the coalition along with former ambassador to France and Channel 2 chairman Yehuda Lancry and his brother and former Lod mayor Maxim. Gesher was once again totally independent, and Levy drifted closer to the policies of the Labour Party and opposition leader Ehud Barak. Levy merged Gesher into One Israel, and became a partner in the new coalition's leadership. With the new system of direct election of the prime minister, and a separate election of the Knesset, the number of parties elected to the body increased markedly in 1999 from eleven to fifteen, and the number would only grow as parties subdivided due to political tensions. The winning faction, One Israel, took only 26 seats, a record low for a governing party, though Barak won 56% of the direct vote for prime minister. Netanyahu's Likud was crushed as expected, winning only 19 seats and leading to his immediate resignation from the Knesset and public life. Levy once again was chosen to be foreign minister, with his deputy being Nawaf Mazalha (One Israel), an Arab Israeli. Levy was for the third time a passive partner as foreign minister. He quit the coalition in April 2000 in response to Barak's attempts to move peace negotiations forward and in protest to the announced plan to withdraw Israeli military forces from Lebanon. Levy was the first minister in Barak's government to resign when his demands were not met. He reformed Gesher along with Maxim Levy and rookie legislator Mordechai Mishani. In February 2002 One Nation quit Sharon's government to protest his economic policies. Their leader, Histadrut Labour Federation chairman Amir Peretz. Levy's position for the elections for the 16th Knesset was precarious. Levy left Gesher and moved back to the Likud. Etty (Estee) Shiraz, the party's head of communications at that time, was elected as the head of Gesher instead of David Levy, and led Gesher in the elections to the 16th Knesset. Levy and his supporters objected in the petition to prevent Shiraz and the rest of Gesher members from continuing the party's activity, and asked to dissolve the party and relate to his move as a merge of his political party in its entirety. The struggle continued years later, while Shiraz and other members of the party are trying to rebuild Gesher and transform it into a modern social party appealing to Israel's young generation of academics and professionals, and David Levy and his supporters seeking to dismantle it. Levy was elected as a member of the 16th Knesset but did not get a realistic place on the Likud list in the election to the 17th Knesset and disappeared from the political arena. Following the Kadima split, Levy failed to acquire a high position on Likud's Knesset list, and as a result of this lost his seat at the 2006 election.

It is an island located at sea from the main harbour of Dakar (), famous as a destination for people interested in the Atlantic slave trade although its actual role in the history of the slave trade is the subject of dispute. Its population as of the 2013 census was 1,680 inhabitants, giving a density of , which is only half the average density of the city of Dakar. Gor√©e is both the smallest and the least populated of the 19 of Dakar. Other important centres for the slave trade from Senegal were further north, at Saint-Louis, Senegal, or to the south in the Gambia, at the mouths of major rivers for trade.Les Guides Bleus: Afrique de l'Ouest (1958 ed.), p. 123 It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was one of the first 12 locations in the world to be designated as such in 1978. The name is a corruption of its original Dutch name , meaning \\"good roadstead\\". History and slave trade The Dutch established the forts of Nassau (1628) and Orange (1639). Coloured engraving, Holland, 17th century Gor√©e is a small island in length and in width sheltered by the Peninsula. Now part of the city of Dakar, it was a minor port and site of European settlement along the coast. Being almost devoid of drinking water, the island was not settled before the arrival of Europeans. The Portuguese were the first to establish a presence on Gor√©e , where they built a small stone chapel and used land as a cemetery. Gor√©e is known as the location of the House of Slaves (), built by an Afro-French M√©tis family about 1780‚Äì1784. The House of Slaves is one of the oldest houses on the island. It is now used as a tourist destination to show the horrors of the slave trade throughout the Atlantic world. After the decline of the slave trade from Senegal in the 1770s and 1780s, the town became an important port for the shipment of peanuts, peanut oil, gum arabic, ivory, and other products of the \\"legitimate\\" trade. It was probably in relation to this trade that the so-called was built. As discussed by historian Ana Lucia Araujo, the building started gaining reputation as a slave depot mainly because of the work of its curator , who was able to move the audiences who visited the house with his performance.Araujo, Ana Lucia. Public Memory of Slavery: Victims and Perpetrators in the South Atlantic (Amherst, NY: Cambria Press, 2010)Araujo, Ana Lucia. Shadows of the Slave Past: Memory, Heritage, and Slavery (New York: Routledge, 2014), 57‚Äì65. Many public personalities visit the House of Slaves, which plays the role of a site of memory of slavery. In June 2013, President of the United States Barack Obama visited the House of Slaves. The island of Gor√©e was one of the first places in Africa to be settled by Europeans, as the Portuguese settled on the island in 1444. It was captured by the United Netherlands in 1588, then the Portuguese again, and again the Dutch. They named it after the Dutch island of , before the British took it over under Robert Holmes in 1664. = French colonial rule = After the French invasion in 1677, during the Franco-Dutch War, the island remained chiefly French until 1960. There were brief periods of British occupation during the various wars fought by France and Britain. In 1960 Senegal was granted independence. The island was notably taken and occupied by the British between 1758 and 1763 following the Capture of Gor√©e and wider Capture of Senegal during the Seven Years' War before being returned to France at the Treaty of Paris (1763). For a brief time between 1779 and 1783, Gor√©e was again under British control, until ceded again to France in 1783 at the Treaty of Paris (1783). During that time, the infamous Joseph Wall was Lieutenant Governor there, who had a man unlawfully flogged to death in 1782.For last period, see for example, Gor√©e was principally a trading post, administratively attached to Saint-Louis, capital of the Colony of Senegal. Apart from slaves, beeswax, hides and grain were also traded. The population of the island fluctuated according to circumstances, from a few hundred free Africans and Creoles to about 1,500. There would have been few European residents at any one time. British capture of Gor√©e during the Seven Years' War, 29 December 1758 In the 18th and 19th century, Gor√©e was home to a Franco-African Creole, or M√©tis, community of merchants with links to similar communities in Saint-Louis and the Gambia, and across the Atlantic to France's colonies in the Americas. M√©tis women, called from the Portuguese descendants of African women and European traders, were especially important to the city's business life. The owned ships and property and commanded male clerks. They were also famous for cultivating fashion and entertainment. One such , , lived in (the modern Haiti) in the 1780s before the Haitian Revolution. Schley, Jacobus van der, 1715‚Äì1779. Island of Gor√©e and its fortifications In February 1794 during the French Revolution, France abolished slavery, and the slave trade from Senegal was said to have stopped. A French engraving of about 1797 (pictured) shows it still going on, but this may be an anachronism. In April 1801, Gor√©e was captured by the British again. In March 1815, during his political comeback known as the Hundred Days, Napoleon definitively abolished the slave trade to build relations with Great Britain. This time, abolition continued. As the trade in slaves declined in the late eighteenth century, Gor√©e converted to legitimate commerce. The tiny city and port were ill-situated for the shipment of industrial quantities of peanuts, which began arriving in bulk from the mainland. Consequently, its merchants established a presence directly on the mainland, first in (1840) and then in Dakar (1857). Many of the established families started to leave the island. Civic franchise for the citizens of Gor√©e was institutionalized in 1872, when it became a French with an elected mayor and a municipal council. , the first African deputy elected to the French National Assembly (served 1914 to 1934), was born on Gor√©e. From a peak of about 4,500 in 1845, the population fell to 1,500 in 1904. In 1940 Gor√©e was annexed to the municipality of Dakar. From 1913 to 1938, Gor√©e was home to the , a government teachers' college run by the French Colonial Government. Many of the school's graduates would one day lead the struggle for independence from France. In 1925 African-American historian, sociologist, and Pan-Africanist W. E. B. Du Bois wrote of the school \\"On the picturesque island of Goree whose ancient ramparts face modern and commercial Dakar I saw two or three hundred fine black boys of high school rank gathered in from all Senegal by competitive tests and taught thoroughly by excellent French teachers in accordance with a curriculum which, as far as it went, was equal to that of any European school,\\" while faulting Colonial France for how limited its public education infrastructure was in the country overall and expressing pessimism about further investment. Gor√©e is connected to the mainland by regular 30-minute ferry service, for pedestrians only; there are no cars on the island. Senegal's premier tourist site, the island was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978. It now serves mostly as a memorial to the slave trade. Many of the historic commercial and residential buildings have been turned into restaurants and hotels to support the tourist traffic. Administration Map of Gor√©e With the foundation of Dakar in 1857, Gor√©e gradually lost its importance. In 1872, the French colonial authorities created the two communes of Saint-Louis and Gor√©e, the first western-style municipalities in West Africa, with the same status as any commune in France. Dakar, on the mainland, was part of the commune of Gor√©e, whose administration was located on the island. However, as early as 1887, Dakar was detached from the commune of Gor√©e and was turned into a commune in its own right. Thus, the commune of Gor√©e became limited to its tiny island. In 1891, Gor√©e still had 2,100 inhabitants, while Dakar only had 8,737 inhabitants. However, by 1926 the population of Gor√©e had declined to only 700 inhabitants, while the population of Dakar had increased to 33,679 inhabitants. Thus, in 1929 the commune of Gor√©e was merged with Dakar. The commune of Gor√©e disappeared, and Gor√©e was now only a small island of the commune of Dakar. In 1996, a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, was divided into 19 to which extensive powers were given. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19 . It coordinates the activities of the , much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs. Thus, in 1996 the of Gor√©e was resurrected, although it is now only a (but in fact with powers quite similar to a ). The new of Gor√©e (officially, the ) took possession of the old (town hall) in the center of the island. This had been used as the of the former commune of Gor√©e between 1872 and 1929. The of Gor√©e is ruled by a municipal council () democratically elected every 5 years, and by a mayor elected by members of the municipal council. The current mayor of Gor√©e is Augustin Senghor, elected in 2002.  Archaeology of Gor√©e Island  The island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, since September 1978. Most of the main buildings in Gor√©e were constructed during the second half of the eighteenth century. The main buildings are the Slave house, 1786; William Ponty School, 1770; (Maritime museum), 1835; , originally called the northern battery, which now contains the Historical Museum of Senegal, built between 1852‚Äì65; (Government Palace), 1864, occupied by the first governor-general of Senegal from 1902‚Äì07. The Gor√©e Castle and the seventeenth-century Gor√©e Police Station, formerly a dispensary, believed to be the site of the first chapel built by the Portuguese in the fifteenth century, and the beach are also of interest to tourists. (1837) This historical site is a rare example of a European colony where we see free and enslaved Africans (making up half of Gor√©e's population), Europeans and Afro-Europeans living alongside each other, even as the island was a prominent center in the Atlantic slave trade. Archaeology on Gor√©e Island leads to many contradictory and contrasting conclusions. On one end of the spectrum, enslaved peoples on Gor√©e were treated poorly, like animals, on the other there is evidence for enslaved peoples being welcomed as part of families. The (free African or Afro-European women) were recorded preferring to eat on the floor with a spoon and communal bowl, as their domestic slaves, but European men kept tradition and used a table. Archaeological research on Gor√©e has been undertaken by Dr Ibrahima Thiaw (Associate Professor of Archaeology at the ; and the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar, Senegal); Dr Susan Keech McIntosh (Professor of Archaeology, Rice University, Houston, Texas); and Raina Croff (PhD candidate at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut). Dr Shawn Murray (University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison) also contributed to archaeological research at Gor√©e through a study of local and introduced trees and shrubs, which aids in identifying the ancient plant remains found in the excavations.\\"Goree Archaeology\\", Rice University, accessed 8 July 2009 Excavations at Gor√©e have also uncovered numerous European imports: bricks, nails, bottles from alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer and other liquor, beads, ceramics and gunflints. = Gor√©e Archaeological Project = The Gor√©e Archaeological Project, or GAP, started its undertakings (survey, testing, mapping, and excavations) in 2001. The project, extending over a period of several years, aimed to collect artifacts pertaining to the historical time periods of the pre- and post- European settlement, as well as identify the use of the different quarters on the island using the material culture excavated from those areas. In his preliminary results, Ibrahima Thiaw also discusses the difficulties of excavation on a primarily tourist island. = Background = (The signare of Gor√©e with her slaves), Portuguese Major Captain and his crew were the first to make Afro-European relations with Gor√©e Island in 1445. After sighting Gor√©e approximately off the shore from modern day Dakar, Senegal, and his officers sent ashore a few officers to leave peace offerings to the natives of the island. They deposited on Gor√©e soil a cake, a mirror and a piece of paper with a cross drawn on it, all of which were intended to be symbols for peaceful actions. However, the Africans did not respond in the desired way and tore up the paper and smashed the cake and the mirror, thus setting the tone for future relations between the Portuguese and Africans of Gor√©e Island. However, history shows even if the Africans has accepted the offerings they would have still been slaughtered and enslaved. As of the early 18th century, Gor√©e settlements were segregated into quarters: the Bambara quarter (slaves), (Christianized Africans), and a quarter for the residents of Gor√©e, including free Africans. By the later half of the 18th century, the segregation was between and their families and the rest of the island as well as the previous instated quarters. = Pre-European settlement = According to preliminary results by Ibrahim Thiaw, the levels between the pre and post European contact deposits were characterized by an obvious infestation of termite nests. One interpretation of this is the possibility that these termite nests were cause of the abandonment of Gor√©e before Dutch arrival. Deposits of the pre-European period are dense with pottery decorated with twine and fish vertebrae motifs and could be found in the domestic settlement context, under or at the same levels of floors and fireplaces. The pottery near the settlements suggests that these settlements were semi-permanent or permanent. Fishing tools and equipment were rare although deposits were dense with fish remains. There was also no sign of iron or its usage before the eighteenth century. Due to a plethora of features containing ritual pots found in the core of the pre European settlement, Thiaw has concluded that the island may have been primarily used for ritual activity and practices. Nevertheless, abandonment is archaeologically evident by the middle of the fifteenth century, possibly due to a mighty termite invasion. There is no archaeological or physical evidence of a struggle or conflict between the eventual Europeans or any other cultural group. Thiaw's hypothesis suggest the possibility that when the Portuguese used the island to bury their dead, the island, in the eyes of the natives, became haunted or was negatively impacted by the mysterious powers of the spirits of the sea. = European settlement = Artist representation of Gor√©e in 1842 There is some speculation of how Gor√©e came to be under European or Dutch control. There is some textual evidence that states that the Dutch purchased the island from the chief of Dakar or from local fisherman on the island. While there is little archaeological evidence of this transaction, all European deposits are relatively abundant. On Gor√©e there are four distinct deposits found through excavation and testing. The first kinds of deposition are located on the northwestern and western part of the island, and were typically three metres of domestic debris and shell midden. Surrounding the area that was once Fort Nassau, these depositions were determined in correlation with Fort Nassau activity, which was seen to be relatively unfluctuating. A rare deposition was found near the Castel at G18, the sole site excavated in the area. Depositions in this area were typically shallow and right on top of a limestone bedrock. However, this one site produced three burials, all of which were dug into the limestone bedrock. G13, a site located on the eastern side of the island, has produced cultural debris from one of its trash pits. This debris includes nails, European late pearlware and early whiteware with similar patterns dating from 1810 to 1849, sardine cans, and window glass, among other artifacts. Located near the military barracks from a military occupation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the analysis of these ceramics suggests that many of them were replacements coinciding with the occupation. Deposits like this were not common around the island. Artist representation of dock at Gor√©e in 1892 As with many archaeological sites around the globe, modern influences and activities affect the sites and lead to disturbances in the archaeological record or unintentional site destruction. The European government imposed strict rules regarding the use of space and overall settlement development on the island. Archaeology shows this development in the soil; the constructions, levelling, reconstructions, some of which can be linked to a change in the European ruler at the time. However, this evidence of development too show results of the consequences from contemporary activity, thus it is an intricate puzzle to determine complex social identities and groups, such as slave or free or African or Afro-European. An overall deduction can be made however: Atlantic trade significantly impacts the lives of those on Gor√©e, seen in the influx of ideas, complex identities and settlement structure. Atlantic trade also influenced the physiological aspects of Gorean society. Archaeology has uncovered a plethora of evidence for massive imports of alcoholic beverages on the island. The massive import of alcoholic beverages naturally suggests a high level of consumption which its effects have been recorded as drunken conflicts, commonly between the military inhabitants. The previously mentioned Dr Ibrahima Thiaw is also the author of Digging on Contested Grounds: Archaeology and the Commemoration of Slavery on Gor√©e Island. In this article, Thiaw discusses the difference between the historical accounts full of slavery and shackles and the lack of archaeological evidence to support those accounts. Raina Croff, one of Thiaw's colleagues, states that she personally has never found any evidence of slavery on Gor√©e Island, however she also includes that archaeological evidence such as shackles and chains would not be found on an island, because there is no need.   Door of No Return at on Gor√©e Island , or the House of Slaves, was built in 1780‚Äì1784 by . Although it is the home of the infamous ‚ÄúDoor of No Return‚Äù, which is said to be the last place exported slaves touched African soil for the rest of their lives, there is little evidence at to suggest a ‚Äúlarge-scale trans-Atlantic slave trade‚Äù economy. According to census records obtained from the 18th century, the majority of enslaved population fell under the category of domestic slaves, rather than slaves to be exported. and his heiress may have had domestic slaves, but again there is little archaeological evidence that they were involved in any slave exportation business. Despite this lack of evidence, has become a pilgrimage site to commemorate forcible removal of Africans from their homeland, also known as the African diaspora. This contrasts with the role of the site of on Gor√©e. At , as the name suggests, there is a presence of dungeons, which can clearly be associated with the confinement of the slaves to be exported. Historian Ana Lucia Araujo has said \\"it‚Äôs not a real place from where real people left in the numbers they say.‚Äù Conversely, UNESCO claims that \\"from the 15th to 19th century, Goree was the largest slave trading centre on the African coast.\\"  Bambara Quartier  On the southcentral end of Gor√©e, in the Bambara quarter, although less abundant in artifacts, the deposits from this area differ in sediment inclusions from the rest of the island. Inclusions such as limestone, red bricks, shell, or stones in these two to three meter depositions are no older than the eighteenth century and shows frequent building up and tearing down processes. This could be correlated to the extensive settlement of this area maybe by domestic slaves beginning in the eighteenth century. Quartier Bambara was a segregated settlement, which suggests domestic slavery rather than exportation. The maps of this settlement has segregated boundary lines that eventually, by the mid-eighteenth century, were shown to be reduced. Found in the center of the island, Bambara was inhabited by the Bambara people. The Bambara people had an unfavorable stereotype; found in the mainland of Senegal and Mali, the Bambara were known for being excellent slaves. Brought to Gor√©e by the French, the Bambara people were set to build roads, forts and houses. These buildings (, , and ), made of stone or brick, contrasted with the structures built by the Africans made of straw and mud. This contrast aided in the segregation and status separation between the Africans and the European inhabitants and followed the common association that masonry was a European influence. However, the construction of these architectural buildings were most likely built by the slaves, and without floor plans, as indicated by the haphazard city layout and irregular angles in the rooms. Settlement analysis demonstrates the possibility that with time, the masters' and the enslaved peoples' statuses evened out enough to work and live side by side on the island by the second half of the eighteenth century.  Disputing Gor√©e as a major trading post for slaves  A slave trader of Gor√©e, engraving of c. 1797 In the 1990s a debate ensued on the veracity of the Gor√©e slave trade as narrated by the conservator . In an article, published in the French newspaper Le Monde, Emmanuel de Roux challenged Ndiaye's repeated claims that Gor√©e, at the so-called ‚ÄúMaison des Esclaves‚Äù, was an important slave depot (which was largely based on the false interpretations of French visitors in the 18‚Äì19th century and afterwards). De Roux based his critique on the works of the researchers Abdoulaye Camara and Father Joseph-Roger de Benoist. According to historical accounts, no more than 500 slaves per year were traded there, a trickle in comparison to the scale of the slave trade along the coasts of modern-day Benin, Guinee and Angola: in total 4‚Äì5% (or around 500 000) of the slaves were shipped from Senegal to the Americas, whereas the remaining 11.5 million enslaved Africans came from the other (West) African shores.This number should be viewed merely as an average of the estimates that range from 10 to 14 million people, given by researchers. A somewhat lower estimate of 9,566,100 people (who ultimately landed in the Americas) was calculated by Noel Deerr and adopted by Philip D. Curtin (1922‚Äì2009) in his book The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (University of Wisconsin Press, repr. 1972), p. 87 (with tallies). A high end of 15,4 million people shipped from Africa, with 13,392,000 ultimately landed in the Americas, was given by J.E. Inikori in the Journal of African History (17) in 1976. Ndiaye's graphic descriptions of the conditions of the slaves allegedly kept at the ‚ÄúMaison des Esclaves‚Äù are not supported by any historical documentationIn fact, Ndiaye probably relied on the unsubstantiated descriptions of his former boss, Pierre Andr√© Cariou, the Breton army doctor of the French marine, who wrote his Promenade to Gor√©e in the 1950s. Cariou himself may have got his background information on Gor√©e from the Guide du tourisme in 1926, or the publications of BRAU, P. L‚Äô√Æle du sortil√®ge ¬ª. Bull. Comit√© d‚Äô√âtudes historiques et scientifiques de l‚ÄôAfrique Occidentale Fran√ßaise, t. XI, n¬∞4, oct.-d√©c. 1928, tir√© √† part, p. 63; GAFFIOT, Robert. Gor√©e, capitale d√©chue. Paris : L. Fournier, 1933, p. 93. and according to De Roux, they may have served to drum up business, especially from African- American tourists.In the commemorative plaque to Ndiaye, he is thanked for his eloquence and his ‚Äúefficient contribution to the cultural and touristic development of Senegal‚Äù (¬´ contribution efficace au d√©veloppement culturel et touristique du S√©n√©gal ¬ª). In response to these accusations, several Senegalese and European researchers convened a symposium at the Sorbonne in April 1997, entitled ‚ÄúGor√©e dans la traite atlantique : mythes et r√©alit√©s‚Äù, whose proceedings were published afterwards. Recently, Hamady Bocoum et Bernard Toulier published an article ‚ÄúThe Fabrication of Heritage: the case of Gor√©e (Senegal)‚Äù (in French: ¬´ La fabrication du Patrimoine : l‚Äôexemple de Gor√©e (S√©n√©gal) ¬ª) documenting the elevation of Gor√©e to an emotionally charged memorial of the transatlantic slave trade for touristic reasons. This was spearheaded by the Senegalese government, begun under President L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, who had tasked his special appointee Ndiaye with this goal. In 2013, journalist Jean Luc Angrand chronicled how Ndiaye began his lobbying campaign among African-American communities in the USA, as he tried to capitalize on their desire to look for their own heritage in Africa that arose in the 1970s. This interest surged after the impact of the TV series Roots, which was most acutely felt among African-American viewers. For this reason Ndiaye exaggerated the importance of Senegal, and Gor√©e in particular, by claiming that no less than 20 million enslaved Africans were shipped from there. Although several English-written media sources have reported on the invented history of Gor√©e, notably John Murphy in the Seattle Times and Max Fischer in the Washington Post, some English news sources, such as the BBC, still cling to the invented narrative of Gor√©e as a major center of the slave trade.  Notable residents  * Latyr Sy, djembe musician * France Gall, the French singer, owned a home there In popular culture Gor√©e Island was the Pit Stop for Leg 4 of The Amazing Race 6, and the Slave House itself was visited during Leg 5. Gor√©e Island has been featured in many songs, due to its history related to the slave trade. The following songs have significant references to Gor√©e Island: * Steel Pulse‚Äì \\"Door Of No Return\\" on African Holocaust (2004) * Doug E. Fresh‚Äì \\"Africa\\" * Akon ‚Äì \\"Senegal\\" * Burning Spear‚Äì \\"One Africa\\" on Jah Is Real (2008) * Alpha Blondy & Solar System‚Äì \\"Goree (Senegal)\\" on Dieu (1994) * Nuru Kane ‚Äì \\"Goree\\" * Sinsemilia - ‚ÄùDe l‚Äôhistoire‚Äù * Gilberto Gil ‚Äì \\"\\", composed by Gilberto Gil and Jos√© Carlos Capinam * The father of French rapper Booba (born Elie Yaffa) is from Gor√©e. In his song \\"\\" he mentions the island, saying \\"\\" (Gor√©e is my land/hometown). Also, in his song \\"0.9\\", he says \\"\\" (When I was 10 I saw Gor√©e, since then my tears have been eternal.\\" * Marcus Miller ‚Äì \\"Gor√©e (Go-ray)\\" In 2007 the Swiss director made a documentary called Retour √† Gor√©e (Return to Gor√©e).

Definitions The basic premise of TVSM is the existence of a d dimensional space R with only positive axis intercepts, i.e. R in R+ and d in N+. Each dimension of R represents a fundamental topic. A term vector t has a specific weight for a certain R. To calculate these weights assumptions are made taking into account the document contents.

(styled as AXA) is a French multinational insurance firm headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris that engages in global insurance, investment management, and other financial services. The Axa Group operates primarily in Western Europe, North America, the India Pacific region, and the Middle East, with a presence also in Africa. Axa is a conglomerate of independently run businesses, operated according to the laws and regulations of many different countries. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. History The company was founded in 1816 as Mutuelle de L'assurance contre L'incendie (the Ancienne Mutuelle). It acquired Compagnie Parisienne de Garantie in 1978 and became Mutuelles Unies. In 1982, it merged with the Drouot Group, owned by the Hottinguer family, becoming Mutuelles Unies/Drouot. The firm adopted the Axa name in 1985. Axa took over The Equitable in 1991 and bought Union des Assurances De Paris (UAP), France's largest insurer, in 1996 to become Axa-UAP. It reverted to the name Axa in 1999.Axa to buy UAP International Herald Tribune, November 13, 1996 In February 1999, Axa acquired Guardian Royal Exchange.Axa of France to buy Guardian of Britain New York Times, February 2, 1999 In May 2000, it acquired all shares it did not already own in Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.Sun Life Stock soars as Axa ups bid to ¬£24bn for remaining stake Independent, May 3, 2000 On June 14, 2006, Axa acquired Winterthur Group from Credit Suisse for approximately ‚Ç¨9 billion.Axa buys Swiss rival Winterthur BBC News, June 14, 2006 As of 2011, Axa was the second most powerful transnational corporation in terms of corporate control over global financial stability. In May 2016, the firm announced that it would stop investing in tobacco shares and bonds and allow its portfolio of tobacco-related bonds to run off. On September 12, 2018, Axa acquired XL Group Ltd, a Bermuda-based property and casualty commercial lines insurer and reinsurer, for $15.3 billion. In October 2019, the company sold Axa Bank Belgium to Crelan for ‚Ç¨620 million (US$688.51 million). The Axa name Despite being written by the company in upper case, \\"AXA\\" is not an acronym, but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO Claude B√©b√©ar hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name. B√©b√©ar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, \\"Elan\\" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because \\"elan\\" is the French word for a moose or elk. In 1985, B√©b√©ar chose the name Axa. Axa Group global locations Italian Headquarters in Milan Operations = United Kingdom = Axa trades in the United Kingdom as Axa UK using a number of subsidiaries such as Axa Insurance, Axa Investment Managers, Axa Wealth and Axa PPP Healthcare. Axa PPP Healthcare was created when Axa bought Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to Aegon. The company also owns the online insurer Swiftcover, distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 Axa was reorganised into \\"strategic business units\\" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets. In September 2013, Axa Wealth was fined ¬£1.8 million by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found \\"serious defects\\" in the way Axa advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments. Axa runs its investment branch through Axa Investment Managers (IM). Axa Sun Life Axa Sun Life was created following the merger between Axa Equity & Law and Sun Life Assurance Society. In 2006 Winterthur Life in the UK was absorbed although Axa continues to use the Winterthur brand for high-net-worth wealth management business. The business units are:Press releases ‚Äì 2006 ‚Äì Axa reorganises to build a more customer-focused organisation * Axa Wealth ‚Äì This includes Axa and Winterthur's bonds and individual pensions, Axa Distribution Services who offer the Elevate wrap platform and Architas. * Corporate Business ‚Äì Axa and Winterthur's group pensions.

The war was put on hold in 1181 on account of two years of famine. As conditions improved in 1183, the Taira sought retribution against Yoshinaka. Taira no Koremori, son of Taira no Shigemori and grandson of the late Taira no Kiyomori, took charge of this operation, backed by Taira Michimori, Tadanori, Taira no Tomonori, Taira no Tsunemasa and Taira no Kiyofusa. Their forces severely reduced by battle and famine, the Taira sought to recruit warriors from the surrounding lands and did so at the risk of further famine, since many of these warriors were farmers leaving their land. The Taira army departed from Kyoto on 10 May 1183. Minamoto no Yoritomo, Yoshinaka's cousin, moved to fight him for dominance of the clan in March 1183, but was convinced to stand down and withdraw by Yoshinaka, who argued that they should be united against the Taira. To ensure his intentions, Yoshinaka also sent his son to Kamakura as a hostage. Shortly afterwards, Yoshinaka received news of Koremori's army, and moved to engage him, along with his uncle Minamoto no Yukiie, Tomoe Gozen, and his shitenn≈ç, Imai Kanehira, Higuchi Kanemitsu, Tate Chikatada and Nenoi Yukichika. Battle Approaching the mountain passes which connect western Honsh≈´ to the east, Koremori split his forces in two, one part taking the Kurikara Pass (between Tsubata, Ishikawa and Oyabe, Toyama today) up to Tonamiyama, the other entering Etch≈´ Province through Noto Province to the north. Minamoto no Yoshinaka, seeing the Taira forces coming up the pass, displayed thirty white banners on Kurosaka Hill a few kilometers away to trick his enemies into believing that his force was larger than it really was. This was a delaying tactic, aimed at keeping the Taira atop the pass until night fell, so that the second part of his strategy could fall in place. He divided his own forces into three, sending one group to attack the Taira from the rear, a second beneath the Pass, as an ambush party; the third he accompanied and held centrally. In order to conceal these movements, Yoshinaka sought to distract his enemy with a highly formal battle, beginning with archery exchanges using whistling-bulb arrows. This was followed by individual duels amongst a hundred samurai, to which the Taira gladly indulged, in the hopes of earning their individual places in the chronicles and epic poetry which were sure to follow such a war. Meanwhile, Yoshinaka's armies moved into position, and as the sun set, the Taira turned to find behind them a Minamoto detachment, holding far more flags than a single detachment should merit, giving the illusion of greater numbers. Yoshinaka's central force, having gathered a herd of oxen, now released them down the pass directly into the Taira army, with lit torches tied to their horns. Many of the Taira warriors were simply knocked off the path. Yoshinaka's soldiers then charged down the north slope forcing the Taira down into the Kairaka Valley and Yoshinaka's ambush. Aftermath The surviving Taira, confused, demoralized, and having suffered heavy losses, fled. This was a major victory for the Minamoto, leading to the Taira abandoning Kyoto.

Calorie restriction is typically adopted intentionally to reduce body weight. It is recommended as a possible regimen by US dietary guidelines and scientific societies for body weight control. Mild calorie restriction may be beneficial for pregnant women to reduce weight gain (without weight loss), and reduce perinatal risks for both the mother and child. For overweight or obese individuals, long-term health improvement may result from calorie restriction, although a gradual weight regain may occur. Health effects = Recommendations = Caloric intake control, and reduction for overweight individuals, is recommended by US dietary guidelines and science-based societies. Calorie restriction is recommended for people with diabetes and prediabetes, in combination with physical exercise and a weight loss goal of 5-15% for diabetes and 7-10% for prediabetes to prevent progression to diabetes. and mild calorie restriction may be beneficial for pregnant women to reduce weight gain (without weight loss) and reduce perinatal risks for both the mother and child. For overweight or obese individuals, calorie restriction may improve health through weight loss, although a gradual weight regain of per year may occur. =Risks of malnutrition= The term \\"calorie restriction\\" as used in the study of aging refers to dietary regimens that reduce calorie intake without incurring malnutrition. If a restricted diet is not designed to include essential nutrients, malnutrition may result in serious deleterious effects, as shown in the Minnesota Starvation Experiment. This study was conducted during World War II on a group of lean men, who restricted their calorie intake by 45%Keys A 1950, p. 114. for 6 months and composed roughly 77% of their diet with carbohydrates.Keys A, Brozek J, Henschels A & Mickelsen O & Taylor H. The Biology of Human Starvation, 1950. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis As expected, this malnutrition resulted in metabolic adaptations, such as decreased body fat, improved lipid profile, and decreased resting heart rate. The experiment also caused negative effects, such as anemia, edema, muscle wasting, weakness, dizziness, irritability, lethargy, and depression. Typical low-calorie diets may not supply sufficient nutrient intake that is typically included in a calorie restriction diet. Nutritionally complete meal replacements can be used to minimize malnutrition.citation needed =Side effects= People losing weight during calorie restriction risk developing side effects, such as cold sensitivity, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or hormonal changes. Research =Humans= The long-term effects of calorie restriction are unknown. =Primates= In a 2017 report on rhesus monkeys, caloric restriction in the presence of adequate nutrition was effective in delaying the effects of aging. Older age of onset, female sex, lower body weight and fat mass, reduced food intake, diet quality, and lower fasting blood glucose levels were factors associated with fewer disorders of aging and with improved survival rates. Specifically, reduced food intake was beneficial in adult and older primates, but not in younger monkeys. The study indicated that caloric restriction provided health benefits with fewer age- related disorders in elderly monkeys and, because rhesus monkeys are genetically similar to humans, the benefits and mechanisms of caloric restriction may apply to human health during aging. =Activity levels= Calorie restriction preserves muscle tissue in nonhuman primates and rodents. Mechanisms include reduced muscle cell apoptosis and inflammation; protection against or adaptation to age-related mitochondrial abnormalities; and preserved muscle stem cell function. Muscle tissue grows when stimulated, so it has been suggested that the calorie-restricted test animals exercised more than their companions on higher calories, perhaps because animals enter a foraging state during calorie restriction. However, studies show that overall activity levels are no higher in calorie restriction than ad libitum animals in youth. Laboratory rodents placed on a calorie restriction diet tend to exhibit increased activity levels (particularly when provided with exercise equipment) at feeding time. Monkeys undergoing calorie restriction also appear more restless immediately before and after meals. = Sirtuin-mediated mechanism = Preliminary research indicates that sirtuins are activated by fasting and serve as \\"energy sensors\\" during metabolism. Sirtuins, specifically Sir2 (found in yeast) have been implicated in the aging of yeast, and are a class of highly conserved, NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase enzymes. Sir2 homologs have been identified in a wide range of organisms from bacteria to humans. =Hormesis= Some research has pointed toward hormesis as an explanation for the benefits of caloric restriction, representing beneficial actions linked to a low-intensity biological stressor such as reduced calorie intake. As a potential role for caloric restriction, the diet imposes a low-intensity biological stress on the organism, eliciting a defensive response that may help protect it against the disorders of aging. In other words, caloric restriction places the organism in a defensive state so that it can survive adversity. =Intensive care= , current clinical guidelines recommend that hospitals ensure that the patients get fed with 80‚Äì100% of energy expenditure, the normocaloric feeding. A systematic review investigated whether people in hospitals' intensive care units have different outcomes with normocaloric feeding or hypocaloric feeding, and found no difference. However, a comment criticized the inadequate control of protein intake, and raised concerns that hypocaloric feeding safety should be further assessed with underweight critically ill people.

Human intelligence A primary purpose of intelligence organizations is to penetrate a target with a human agent, or a network of human agents. Such agents can either infiltrate the target, or be recruited \\"in place\\". Case officers are professionally trained employees of intelligence organizations that manage human agents and human agent networks. Intelligence that derives from such human sources is known by the abbreviation HUMINT. Sometimes, agent handling is done indirectly, through \\"principal agents\\" that serve as proxies for case officers. It is not uncommon, for example, for a case officer to manage a number of principal agents, who in turn handle agent networks, which are preferably organized in a cellular fashion. In such a case, the principal agent can serve as a \\"cut-out\\" for the case officer, buffering him or her from direct contact with the agent network. Utilizing a principal agent as a cut-out, and ensuring that the human agent network is organized in a cellular fashion, can provide some protection for other agents in the network, as well as for the principal agent, and for the case officer in the event that an agent in the network is compromised. Assuming that standard principles of intelligence tradecraft have been strictly observed by the principal agent and the agents in the network, compromised agents will not be able to identify the case officer, nor the other members of the network. Ideally, agents may work side by side in the same office, and conduct their clandestine collection activities with such discipline, that they will not realize that they are both engaged in espionage, much less members of the same network. Since an agent can sometimes identify his or her principal agent, however, or reveal information under interrogation that can lead to the identification of a principal agent, the protection provided by cellular network organization can be time-sensitive. If principles of intelligence tradecraft have not been strictly observed, it is also possible that compromised agents can reveal information that exposes other members of the network. In the real world of espionage, human lapses are very much the norm, and violations of the principles of tradecraft are common. It is for this reason that agents are ideally trained to resist interrogation for a defined period of time. If an agent is able to resist interrogation for a defined period of time, the odds improve that other members of the network can be alerted to the compromise. Case officer A case officer is an intelligence officer who is a trained specialist in the management of agents and agent networks.case officer, thefreedictionary.com, retrieved 4 March 2009 Case officers manage human agents and human intelligence networks. Case officers spot potential agents, recruit prospective agents and train agents in tradecraft. Case officers emphasize the elements of tradecraft that enable the agent to acquire needed information, and enable the case officer to communicate with and supervise the agent. Most importantly, case officers train agents in methods of avoiding detection by host nation counter- intelligence organizations. Agents, spotting, and recruitment By definition, an \\"agent\\" acts on behalf of another, whether another individual, an organization, or a foreign government. Agents can be considered either witting or unwitting, and in some cases, willing or unwilling. Agents typically work under the direction of a principal agent or a case officer. When agents work alone, and are not members of an agent network, they are termed \\"singletons\\". The identification of potential agents is termed \\"agent spotting\\" (also termed \\"talent spotting\\"). Identifying potential agents, and investigating the details of their personal and professional lives, involves the granular verification of their bona fides. Such activities can include uncovering personal details that leave potential agents vulnerable to coercion, blackmail, or other inducements, such as sexual approaches. Approaches to potential agents can be multitudinous and considerable time can pass before the potential agent is maneuvered into a position where a recruitment \\"pitch\\" can be hazarded. Training Agent training often includes techniques of tradecraft such as clandestine communication, including cryptography, the use of one-time pads, the construction of concealment devices, and the employment of dead drops. Other elements of tradecraft include elicitation, surveillance and countersurveillance, photography and the emplacement of audio devices, sensors, or other transmitters. Case officers generally train agents one at a time, in isolation, including only those elements of tradecraft needed to penetrate the target at hand. Case officers will also teach agents how to develop cover for status, and cover for action, meaning how to establish credible pretexts for their presence and behavior while engaged in collection activities. A well-trained and competent agent can conduct his or her clandestine tasks while under close surveillance, and still evade detection. More advanced agent training can include resistance to interrogation.

Lange & S√∂hne is a trademark of Lange Uhren GmbH, a German manufacturer of luxury and prestige watches. The company was originally founded by Ferdinand Adolph Lange in Glash√ºtte, Germany in 1845. The original A. Lange & S√∂hne was nationalized and ceased to exist in 1948, following the occupation by the Soviet Union after World War II. The current A. Lange & S√∂hne trademark was re-registered when Lange Uhren GmbH was founded in 1990 by Walter Lange, the great-grandson of Ferdinand Adolph Lange. A. Lange & S√∂hne is a highly regarded watch manufacturer. Notable early patrons and timepieces owners of Lange included German Emperor Wilhelm II, Abdul Hamid II of Ottoman Empire, and Alexander II of Russia. Since 2000, Lange Uhren GmbH has been a subsidiary of the Swiss Richemont Group. Lange watches boast distinctive Glash√ºtte style in appearance and design, which is closer to the classic British style and is different from Swiss styles. The company's current model families are Lange 1, Zeitwerk, Saxonia, 1815 and Richard Lange.  History  Ferdinand Adolph Lange = Early history = Ferdinand Adolph Lange, son of Johann Samuel Lange, was born in Dresden on February 25, 1815. When his parents were separated, he was adopted by a foster family, who luckily offered him a chance of proper education. In 1829, he entered the Technische Bildungsanstalt (technical education institute) of Dresden. The training in the school was accompanied by three days of theoretical studies and the other three days were devoted to manual craftwork with a student's master. Ferdinand Adolph Lange's master was Johann Christian Friedrich Gutkaes (the maker of the famous Five- Minute Clock at Dresden's Semperoper), who at the time was second mechanic at the Mathematics and Physics Salon providing an astronomical clock with a mercury compensation pendulum for his service observatory. After finishing his apprenticeship with honours in 1835, Ferdinand A. Lange worked for Gutkaes for more than two years. In 1837 Lange embarked on his journeyman years, which took him to France, England and Switzerland. In Paris, he spent four years working as workshop manager of Austrian watchmaker Joseph Thadd√§us Winnerl (inventor of the split-seconds chronograph). The lectures given by the physician and director of the Paris Observatory Dominique Fran√ßois Arago extended his knowledge of astronomy. After France, he went to Switzerland and Great Britain to improve his knowledge and skills even further with well-known watchmakers. However, Lange's intention was to set up a watchmaking industry in Saxony. He returned to Dresden in 1841 and became partners with his master's business. Lange wasted no time in building complicated watches to put into practice what he learnt through his journey years, which all noted in his notebook. His main ambition was the industrialization of the area and become independent as he made verbal proposals in a letter he sent to the government minister Von Lindenau and councillor Weissenbach. His ambition was to found a watch manufactory in Saxony. He asked a commission from the government to grant him a business licence in the less economically fortunate region, ‚ÄúErzgebirge‚Äù (Ore Mountains) in Glash√ºtte. Mentions in the letter as follows: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Should the high council be able and willing to grand the wherewithal for the establishment of an institiuton and the welfare of 10-15 young people, and to entrust me with its leadership, I am certain that in a near future, livelihood and prosperity will spread among a large number of these unfortunate people‚Ä¶‚Äù On December 7, 1845, he founded A. Lange & Cie, which later became A. Lange & S√∂hne in Glash√ºtte. Lange founded not only a watchmaking factory that would bear his name; he also established his vision for an entire industry. Starting with a team of 15 apprentices, to whom he taught the basics of watchmaking. Later on, when they had thoroughly mastered the crafts, he encouraged them to leave his company to start their own small supplier firms. Thus, he established a watchmaking cluster, which provided the region with a new means to make a living. As Ferdinand Adolph Lange travelled through France he saw French watchmakers still used duodecimal ligne as length unit instead of the new metric system. Accordingly, he recorded detailed calculations for each individual gear-wheel size. Returning from his travels, he started to use the metric system in watchmaking instead of the traditional norm, ligne. Soon after, he built his first micrometer in Dresden from the plans in his journey book. It could measure millimeters to the thousandth. Along with a measurement system, he invented various tools like hand-powered face-lathe to slide-rules and dixieme gauges. = Rise to fame = In 1868, Ferdinand A. Lange's elder son Richard entered the company, and the company name changed to A. Lange & S√∂hne (A. Lange & Sons). He had seven children and also took on political responsibility in his home town: He was the mayor of Glash√ºtte for a period of 18 years. After retiring from this position, he was awarded with the honorary citizenship. Additionally, the citizens of Glash√ºtte established the Lange Foundation, which provided pensions for local watchmakers. He passed away in 1875. At the time when Emil and Richard Lange joined the company, the name A. Lange & S√∂hne was already growing and the company needed new premises. In 1873, the company moved to the Stammhaus, which is being used as the company's headquarters today. The new building gave Lange senior the opportunity to realize his idea ‚Äì a clock with a pendulum of almost 10 meters ‚Äì the longest in the world. Emil and Richard Lange were complementing each other. While Emil was interested in business, Richard Lange followed his father's path. He advanced his father's inventions and patents such as quarter repeater and chronograph. Some of his notable patents include an up/down power reserve indicator (patent No.9349), improved chronometer restraints, pocket watch with minutes counter, and addition of beryllium to improve the rate characteristic of balance spring Emil Lange was awarded the cross of the Knight of the French Legion of Honor for his services as a juror at the Paris world fair and the presentation of the ‚ÄúJahrhunderttourbillon‚Äù (tourbillon of the century). The model was auctioned in 1990 and sold for 1,500,000 Marks. Furthermore, Emil Lange was given the honorary title of ‚ÄúKommerzienrat‚Äù (commercial councilor) by King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony for his success as businessman. In 1898, German Emperor Wilhelm II commissioned A. Lange & S√∂hne to make a pocket watch that would be presented to Sultan Abdul Hamid II during an official visit of the Ottoman Empire. The watch is in the collection of the Topkapƒ± Palace. The turn of the 20th century came with a change in fashion. Flat watches for men were increasing in demand. A. Lange & S√∂hne came up with a new design and registered it in 1898 as ‚ÄúGlash√ºtte caliber‚Äù pocket watch. However, in the beginning of the century, in 1904 ‚ÄúGlash√ºtte Pr√§zisons-Uhrenfabrik Akt. Ges.‚Äù was founded and then in 1906 ‚ÄúNomos-Uhr-Gesellschaft‚Äù came up. Both companies offered machine-made watches or movements imported from Switzerland and cased up in Glash√ºtte. By contrast, A. Lange & S√∂hne was still offering hand-made watches and operating with high costs. = World War I & II = A. Lange & S√∂hne Stammhaus, Glash√ºtte. Due to World War I, demand for precious gold watches fell sharply. Many companies had to let go most of their workforce. At the same time, Germany closed its borders to Swiss watches and movements forcing firms dependent on Switzerland out of production. Shortly after the war, German watchmakers founded ‚ÄúDeutsche Pr√§zisions-Uhrenfabrik Glash√ºtte in Sachsen GmbH‚Äù (German precision watch factory Glash√ºtte in Saxony), known by its acronym DPUG. The idea was to go to mass production using latest technological machinery. Emil Lange decided not to follow this direction. In 1919, he retired and left the company to his three sons: Otto, Rudolf and Gerhard Lange. To counter inexpensive production of DPUG, Otto Lange launched a new brand ‚ÄúOLIW‚Äù (Original Lange Internationales Werk) and designed a 43mm diameter movement. It was protected in Germany under registered design No. 748 972. It took years to complete the OLIW and serial production did not start until the late 1920s. Between 1921 and 1923, hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic triggered a wave of corporate bankruptcies. Prices ran out of control, for example a loaf of bread, which cost 250 marks in January 1923, had risen to 200,000 million marks in November 1923. At A. Lange & S√∂hne, sales of OLIW remained behind expectations. In the Glash√ºtte watch industry, most of the workforce was laid off during 1920 and 1930s. Walter Lange describes the situation as follows: ‚ÄúI was born in the Weimar era; then came the crash in 1929 and the great unemployment. I can still see it today; it was a childhood trauma for me, when I looked out the living room window and saw all the unemployed men lined up, waiting across the street. I will never forget that view.‚Äù Germany's military buildup of the 1930s brought the demand for precision watches back to Glash√ºtte. From the second half of the thirties to the end of World War II, A. Lange & S√∂hne was one of five watch manufacturers (the others being Stowa, Laco, Wempe and IWC) that built B-Uhren for Germany's air force (Luftwaffe). B-Uhren is an abbreviation of Beobachtungsuhren, literally: observation watches. The total military production amounted to about 13,500 precision watches, equipped with caliber 48 (small seconds) and caliber 48.1 (sweep seconds) with a movement diameter of 48mm. On 8 May 1945, the last day of the war, the Lange headquarter and main production building was almost completely destroyed in a Soviet air raid. The Glash√ºtte watch companies were nationalized in 1948. At the time, Lange was working on a new movement: Caliber 28, a wristwatch format of the caliber 48. It went into production in 1949 as the last movement developed by A. Lange & S√∂hne. Watches from this period were signed ‚ÄúLange VEB‚Äù (Volkseigener Betrieb - publicly owned enterprise). When the seized watch companies were merged in 1951 to form VEB Glash√ºtter Uhrenbetriebe, the Lange name disappeared from the dials. = Recent development = On December 7, 1990, following German reunification, Walter Lange and G√ºnter Bl√ºmlein, a watch industry executive, restored the company as Lange Uhren GmbH, with the assistance of several Swiss watch manufacturers, including IWC and Jaeger- LeCoultre. It was re-established on the exact date 145 years after Walter's great-grandfather Ferdinand Adolph Lange founded the original company. The new company re-registered A. Lange & S√∂hne as its trademark, and was again based in Glash√ºtte. It presented its first range of wristwatches in 1994. Since 2000, A. Lange & S√∂hne has been a member of the Richemont group, and only manufactured around five thousand watches every year. In 2017, Walter Lange died at age 92.The GQ Watch Guide 2018 GQ magazine, 15 August 2018  Pronunciation and spelling  A. Lange & S√∂hne is approximately pronounced [ah LAHNG-eh unt ZURN-neh]. Where the Umlaut \\"√∂\\" is not available, it is rendered as a digraph by German convention (\\"Soehne\\"), but often as \\"Sohne\\" internationally (even though that would imply a different pronunciation in German).  Motto and slogan  One of A. Lange & S√∂hne's company slogans is \\"State-of-the-art Tradition\\". In addition, a notable personal motto of Walter Lange is \\"Never Stand Still\\". Watch manufacturing A. Lange & S√∂hne alt=All A. Lange & S√∂hne watches contain mechanical rather than quartz movements, and, with the exception of a very few special edition watches and the Odysseus model, Lange watch cases are made of yellow gold, rose gold, white gold, or platinum. Lange's movements are developed, produced, and assembled by Lange itself. In addition to time-only watches, both manually wound and automatic, Lange is known for its complicated watches, including chronographs and split- seconds chronographs, and perpetual calendars. = Design and finishing = The design philosophy of A. Lange & S√∂hne was established in 1990 when the company was re-established, and it draws from heritage. Lange's watches are often described as more \\"austere\\" or \\"Teutonic\\" in appearance than watches produced by comparable Swiss firms. Case and dial design are straightforward, confident, solid and comforting. Recurrent design elements are the outsize date, inspired by the stage clock of Dresden's Semperoper, solid gold or platinum cases, the shape of the soldered lugs, the galvanized solid-silver dials and the customized typography based on the ‚ÄúEngravers‚Äù font from 1899. The company employs hand-finishing for all their pieces. A. Lange & S√∂hne applies same level of top hand-finishing on all their pieces from the basic Saxonia to Grand Complication. The hand-engraved balance cock is the brand's signature technique. A. Lange & S√∂hne uses a multitude of different surface decorations. The most frequent finishing techniques are chamfering, circular graining, contour grinding, engraving, mirror polish, linear finish, perlage, Glash√ºtte ribbing, sunray finish and black polish. = Movements = Lange's movement design and decoration is distinctively Glash√ºtte in appearance, eschewing typically Swiss features, such as multiple bridges and cocks, or pearlage, \\"Glash√ºtte stripes\\", hand-engraved balance cocks and screwed gold chatons. The movements are made from a metal known as German silver, as opposed to the plated brass typically used for Swiss movements. It requires extra care and attention of the watchmaker. One wrong move carries the risk of tainting and tarnishing the material. Each watch movement is designed and made entirely in-house. Since 1994, the brand has developed 63 different movements. Many of the movements feature patented constructions and advancements. The brand is especially known for its chronograph mechanisms. According to Lange's director of product development, Anthony de Haas, it takes four to five years to develop a watch with a new caliber. The movement numbers are named regarding their development years. For example, L043.1 (Zeitwerk) indicates that work on this particular Lange (L) movement started in 2004 (04), that it is the third project of that year (3) and that it is the first version of this caliber (.1). Prototypes undergo rigorous load tests before going into series production. The testing routine includes a shaking test, a hammer test, which simulates a free fall from a height of one meter onto a hardwood floor, a pusher test, during which each pusher is pressed 50,000 times and a climatic chamber, where the watches are exposed to temperatures from minus 20 degrees to 80 degrees.A. Lange & S√∂hne pocket watch (No. 63354) = Notable inventions and patents = *1864, Stable three-quarter plate. In 1864, Ferdinand Adolph Lange introduced the three-quarter plate in his pocket watches. It replaced the many separate bridges which until then held the arbors of the going train. While this requires more time and effort during the assembly phase, it clearly improves the stability of the movement. Only the balance cock with the oscillation system remained exposed, located beneath a cock. *1867, Jumping seconds hand. In 1867, Lange developed a jumping-seconds mechanisms for a pocket watch, which his sons Richard and Emil adapted slightly and filed for patent ten years later. Further patents include a keyless winding and hands- setting, a system for the removal of the mainspring barrel, a constant-force escapement, a chronograph, an aluminium balance-spring29 and a quarter repeater. *1902, Grand Complication No. 42500. The Grand Complication was made in 1902 as a unique piece. It was sold to Heinrich Sch√§fer of Vienna for the price of 5600 Marks which at the time was the equivalent of a villa in Dresden, Germany. The watch houses 833 individual parts and features the following complications: chiming mechanism with grand and small strike (grande et petite sonnerie), minute repeater, split-seconds chronograph with minute counter, perpetual calendar with moon phase, flying seconds (seconde foudroyante), and so on. In 2001, the watch came back to Glash√ºtte during a manufacture visit from customers who left it to the hands of the restoration workshop to be repaired. It took a team of five experts and almost seven years to renovate the watch as it was in 1902. In 2010, the restored piece was first exhibited at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH). The watch is now on permanent loan in the Mathematisch-Physikalischer Salon (Royal Cabinet of Mathematical and Physical Instruments) in Dresden. *1931, Richard Lange's balance spring patent. Elinvar balance spring's introduction was revolutionary because it was removing the effects of temperature over the elasticity of the spring. After Emil Lange's introduction of the nickel-steel balance to Germany, Richard Lange's interest in the metallurgical aspect of watchmaking was awoken. He was the first to realise that adding beryllium to nickel and steel lessened the sensitivity of hairsprings to temperature fluctuations and magnetic fields on the one hand, while improving their elasticity and hardness in comparison with the Elinvar alloy springs. His patent application ‚ÄúMetal alloys for watch springs‚Äù in Germany and was granted in 1931. His invention created the base of the Nivarox balance springs that are still in use today. *1997, Zero reset mechanism. In 1997, A. Lange & S√∂hne introduced an advanced and elaborate self-winding movement: the Sax-0-Mat calibre features an integrated Zero-Reset mechanism that stops the balance when the crown is pulled and instantaneously moves the seconds hand to the zero position, much like in a chronograph. *2005, Disengagement mechanism. With this invention, Lange's split-seconds chronographs ‚Äì Double Split and Triple Split ‚Äì can be activated without causing a decline in amplitude. The mechanism prevents friction loss encountered in conventional solutions by separating the interlocking connection between the rattrapante hands and the chronograph hands on the chronograph centre arbor and on the minute counter arbor when the rattrapante button is actuated. *2008, Stop-seconds for tourbillon. A. Lange & S√∂hne is the only brand to find a way to stop the oscillating balance inside the revolving tourbillon cage to allow precise time setting in watches endowed with this complication. Pulling the crown triggers a complex lever ensemble that pivots a movable V-shaped spring into the balance rim. It instantly stops the balance. When the crown is pushed, the ‚Äúbrake‚Äù is released, and the balance instantly begins to oscillate again. *2018, Triple-split chronograph. In January 2018, Lange introduced the triple- split chronograph, an advancement from Lange's double-split chronograph introduced in 2004. The new chronograph can compare the times of two concurrent events, of up to twelve hours' duration and to the accuracy of one- sixth of a second. Being the world's first mechanical split-seconds chronograph that allows multi-hour comparative time measurements, the watch also features Lange's patented isolator mechanism to preserve the amplitude of the balance wheel while the chronograph is running to ensure precision at all times.  Notable models  A. Lange & S√∂hne alt= = Most expensive pieces = *On November 12, 2007, an 18K-pink-gold A. Lange & S√∂hne pocket watch (No. 46177) manufactured in 1904 was auctioned by Christie's for around 0.95 million US dollars (1,057,000 CHF). The pocket watch contains complications such as minute repeater, perpetual calendar, split-second chronograph, and so on. * On May 12, 2018, a unique A. Lange & S√∂hne 1815 \\"Homage to Walter Lange\\" made in stainless steel was sold for US$852,525 in Phillips' Geneva auction. This is one of the auction records for Lange timepieces. The proceeds went to Children Action, a Swiss children's relief organization. The watch model was introduced in 2018 to pay tribute to the late Walter Lange. It was limited to 263 pieces in total in the following metals: pink gold (145), white gold (90), yellow gold (27) and steel. Notably, it was the first 1815 model that included a jumping seconds hand, a complication first devised by the founder himself. *In 2013, Lange introduced the Grand Complication, which boasts multifarious complications including a chiming mechanism with grand and small strike (grande et petite sonnerie), a minute repeater, a split-seconds chronograph with minute counter, and a perpetual calendar with moon phase and flying seconds (seconde foudroyante). Upon release, the piece was the most complicated wristwatch ever made in Germany. The retail price for the watch was million, and only six pieces have been produced. It took about a year for a master watchmaker to assemble the mechanism. = 1815 = In general, Lange 1815 is a family of wristwatches that pays a tribute to the legacy of Ferdinand Adolph Lange, who was born in the year 1815 and founded the company in 1845. The Lange 1815 family consists of watch models with complications such as chronograph, annual calendar, tourbillon, perpetual calendar and so on. The watches in this line take their roots from Lange pocket watches to the present time by using traditional elements like railway minute track, Arabic numerals and clubs-shaped markers on the 15-minute intervals. Additionally, a couple notable models of the Lange 1815 include the \\"1815 'Homage to Walter Lange,'\\" limited in production to just 263 time pieces, and the \\"1815 Rattrapante Perpetual Calendar in Platinum,\\" winner of the Grande Complication Prize and the Public Prize at the Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Geneve. = Zeitwerk = Introduced in 2009, the Zeitwerk is the first mechanical watch that displays the time from left to right in a digital looking manner. Its designers had challenged everything, except mechanical principles, to come up with a patented mechanism that drove three precisely switching hour and minute discs. In November 2009, it was awarded the ‚ÄúAigulle d‚ÄôOr‚Äù at the Grand Prix d‚ÄôHorlogerie de Gen√®ve. Encouraged by the success, the watch was turned into a family of its own. The Zeitwerk range includes several watches with striking complications as well as a model featuring a ring-shaped date display. = Lange 1 = The Lange 1 is one of the first watch models introduced after A. Lange & S√∂hne trademark was re-established in 1990s. It is a family of watches that boasts a unique decentralized and asymmetrical dial design, as well as the outsize date display. Specifically, the \\"Lange 1\\" model features an asymmetric layout with no overlap among its key indicators: a dial displaying the hours and minutes, a smaller subsidiary dial displaying seconds, an oversized double window date display, and a power reserve indicator.

He was known as \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" after one of his early hits. Life and career Vaughan with Marilyn Monroe in Let's Make Love (1960) Vaughan was born Frank Fruim Abelson on Devon Street in the Islington district of Liverpool on 3 February 1928, one of four children of Isaac and Leah Abelson. He came from a family of Russian-Jewish descent, and derived his stage surname from his grandmother; as he was her first-born grandson, she called him \\"Frank my 'number one' grandson\\", and her Russian accent made \\"one\\" sound like \\"Vaughan\\". In his early life, he was a member of the Lancaster Lads' Club, a member group of the National Association of Boys' Clubs; having started out at the club intending to become a boxer, he was a major contributor to them during his career, dedicating his monetary compensation from one song each year to them. He was an evacuee during World War II. He attended the Lancaster College of Art on a scholarship and was a vocalist in their dance band. After a stint in the Royal Army Medical Corps (where he spent most of his time boxing) he returned to art school, this time at the Leeds College of Art. When he won a prize in a design contest, he left for London, where he won second prize on a radio talent show. Vaughan's career began in the late 1940s performing song and dance routines. He was known as a fancy dresser, wearing top hat, bow tie, tails, and cane. In the 1950s he worked for a few years with the band of Nat Temple, and after that period he then began making records under his own name. In 1955, he recorded what was to become his trademark song, \\"Give Me the Moonlight, Give Me the Girl\\". He recorded a large number of songs that were covers of United States hit songs, including Perry Como's \\"Kewpie Doll,\\" Jimmie Rodgers' \\"Kisses Sweeter than Wine,\\" Boyd Bennett's \\"Seventeen\\" (also covered in the US by the Fontane Sisters), Jim Lowe's \\"The Green Door,\\" and (with the Kaye Sisters), the Fleetwoods' \\"Come Softly to Me\\". In 1956, his cover of \\"The Green Door\\" reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. The same year he was voted 'Showbusiness Personality of the Year'. In early 1957, his version of \\"The Garden of Eden\\", reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1961, Vaughan hit No. 1 in the UK again, with \\"Tower of Strength\\", but the rise of beat music eclipsed his chart career for two or three years, before he returned to the Top 10 in 1967 with \\"There Must Be a Way\\". Chart success eluded him after this although he did have two more Top 40 singles; \\"Nevertheless\\" and \\"So Tired\\". In 1957 he was voted the eighth most popular star at the British box office.Most Popular Film of the Year. The Times (London, England), Thursday, 12 December 1957; pg. 3; Issue 54022 In the late 1960s, Vaughan, involved himself with a youth project in Easterhouse, Glasgow. He was appalled by the level of violence amongst young people. Vaughan held meetings with the gang leaders and appealed for them to surrender their weapons. Managed at this time by former journalist and theatrical agent Paul Cave, Vaughan stayed in the United States for a time to make a film with Marilyn Monroe, Let's Make Love (1960), and was an actor in several other films, but his recordings were never chart hits in the US, with the exception of \\"Judy\\", which reached No.100 on the Billboard Hot 100 in August 1958. In 1961, Vaughan was on the bill at the Royal Variety Performance at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Coventry Street, London. In 1985, Vaughan starred in a stage version of 42nd Street at Drury Lane in London, opposite his old friend Shani Wallis who appeared in their first film together, Ramsbottom Rides Again. After a year, he nearly died of peritonitis and had to leave the cast. Vaughan was married to Leeds-born Stella Shock (1924-2015) from 1951 until his death; the couple had three children, a daughter Susan (b.1963) and two sons, singer and yoga elder David Sye (b.1961) and actor-singer Andrew Abelson (b.1968). In 1994, he was one of a few to be honoured by a second appearance on This Is Your Life, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. Vaughan had been a subject of the show previously in April 1970 when Eamonn Andrews surprised him at the Caesar's Palace nightclub in Luton. Despite frequent bouts of ill-health, Vaughan continued performing until shortly before his death from heart failure in 1999. Awards and honours Vaughan was awarded an OBE in 1965, a CBE in 1996, and as a long-time resident of High Wycombe had been a Deputy Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire since 1993. He was an Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University. He also received the Variety Club of Great Britain Award for \\"Showbusiness Personality of the Year\\" in 1957. Death Vaughan died from heart failure at his home in High Wycombe aged 71. His wife Stella donated archival materials, including scores and sheet music he had collected throughout his career to Liverpool John Moores University in 2000.

He was the head of state of Ghana and leader of the military government in 1969 and then Chairman of the Presidential Commission between 1969 and 1970. He continued as a farmer and political activist. He was elected Member of Parliament in 1979 but was executed before he could take his seat. He was executed together with two other former heads of state, General Kutu Acheampong and General Fred Akuffo, and five other Generals (Utuka, Felli, Boakye, Robert Kotei and Amedume), in June 1979. He was also popularly referred to by his title Okatakyie Akwasi Amankwaa Afrifa and was in addition the Abakomahene of Krobo in the Asante- Mampong Traditional Area of the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Education and training He joined the Ghana Army in 1957 and was sent to the Regular Officer's Special Training School. From there, he attended the Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot, England in 1958. He then completed officer training at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, England. In 1961, he was at the School of Infantry, Hythe, United Kingdom. Career In 1960, Afrifa was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Ghana Armed Forces. From 1962 up to 1964, he was a General Staff Officer in the army. He next attended the Defence College, at Teshie in Accra. Afrifa was one of the officers who served in the Ghana contingent of the United Nations Operation in the Congo. Afrifa rose through the ranks to become a Major. He was also staff officer in charge of army training and operations by 1965. He was based at Kumasi, at the headquarters of the Second Infantry Brigade (now the Northern Command) of the Ghana Army. Politics =24 February 1966 coup= While at Kumasi, Afrifa became friends with Emmanuel Kwasi Kotoka, then a Colonel and the Commander of the Second Infantry Brigade. At the time, Ghana had become a one-party state, political opposition was effectively removed with the Preventive Detention Act of 1958 and in 1964 Nkrumah declared himself President for Life. Simultaneously, the export price of Ghana's main foreign exchange earner, cocoa, plummeted. This, combined with ambitious domestic expenditure on much needed social infrastructure and on well documented white elephants, led to the bankruptcy of Ghana. There was a lot of discontent among the general population as prices rocketed for basic consumer goods which were widely unavailable, and among the Ghana Armed Forces. Kwame Nkrumah had asked the military at the time to prepare for a possible campaign in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) against the racist r√©gime that had been established there. Under the pretext of a training exercise, Kotoka, moved his troops from Kumasi to Accra for the coup. Afrifa was his right-hand man in the coup exercise. It turned out later that, unhappy with Nkrumah's strengthening ties with Russia, China and other communist states, the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States had been kept updated about preparations for this coup and may have helped create difficulties for the Nkrumah government to facilitate this. The coup plotters struck while Nkrumah was on a trip to Hanoi, then the capital of North Vietnam. Afrifa's brief was to take the Broadcasting House, the base from which the national radio station broadcast its news and programmes. This succeeded after heavy fighting, allowing Kotoka to go on air to announce the coup d'√©tat to the whole nation. =Allegations of atrocities= There have been allegations by members of Nkrumah's Presidential Detail Department (PDD) responsible for the personal protection of Nkrumah that they were physically tortured, some apparently in the presence of Kotoka, J. W. K. Harlley and Afrifa. Martin Okai, a member of the PDD, claimed at the National Reconciliation Commission hearings that his torture was supervised by Afrifa. =Time in government= Following the coup, Kotoka became one of the eight members of the National Liberation Council (NLC). Afrifa also went through a series of rapid promotions rising from Major to Lieutenant General in the three years his government was in power. He was also appointed the Commissioner (Minister) for Finance and Trade. The Head of state of Ghana and Chairman of the NLC, Joseph Arthur Ankrah was forced to resign in April 1969 following a bribery scandal involving Francis Nzeribe, a Nigerian businessman. He was replaced by Afrifa as Head of state. Ankrah was accused of effecting payments to influence the results of a poll which showed him ahead of Afrifa and Kofi Abrefa Busia for the national elections due in August 1969. Afrifa was a supporter of Busia, the leader of the Progress Party who was a candidate in the forthcoming National Assembly elections. Afrifa handed over to Busia who became the Prime Minister of Ghana on inauguration of the Second Republic. He continued as Chairman of the newly created Presidential Commission until August 1970 when he was replaced by Nii Amaa Ollennu, the Speaker of Parliament in the Second Republic. =Campaign for democracy= After the overthrow of the democratically elected Busia government by Acheampong and the National Redemption Council, Afrifa, a known supporter of Busia was arrested two days later on 15 January 1972 and detained until December 1972. Following his release, Afrifa restricted himself largely to farming at his home town of Mampong. In 1978, the Supreme Military Council (SMC) government sought to introduce a new and widely criticized political system called Union Government (UNIGOV) which was to be a military and civilian partnership rather than a return to a multi-party democracy. A referendum was scheduled in March 1978, and Afrifa was one of the leaders of the Popular Movement for Freedom and Justice, which led the opposition to this UNIGOV concept. Joined by students and the intelligentsia among others, the PMFJ demanded a return to constitutional multi-party democracy. =Elected Member of Parliament= Following the fall of Acheampong, the new SMC under General Fred Akuffo organized presidential and parliamentary elections on 18 June 1979 for a multi-party national assembly. The elections were, however, held under the government of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) as the SMC itself had been overthrown on 4 June 1979. Afrifa stood for and won the Mampong North constituency seat on the ticket of the United National Convention, whose roots were from the Progress Party of Kofi Abrefa Busia. On 26 June 1979, eight days after his election, Afrifa was executed and thus never had the opportunity to take his seat in the Parliament of the Third Republic of Ghana and was succeeded in parliament by Ebenezer Augustus Kwasi Akuoko. Other roles The late Asantehene (Asante king), Otumfuo Opoku Ware II, honoured Afrifa with the title \\"Okatakyie\\" (meaning \\"hero\\" in Asante) after the NLC had returned power to the civilian Busia government. Afrifa was also the Abakomahene of Krobo in the Asante-Mampong Sekyere Traditional Area in the Ashanti Region. Afrifa is also credited with initiating the Krobo Rehabilitation Project, raising funds leading to the rebuilding of the entire village. Family Afrifa was the son of Opanin Kwaku Amankwa and Ama Serwaa Amaniampong, both from Krobo, near Mampong, in the Ashanti Region. At the time of his execution, he was married to Christine Afrifa, with whom he had nine children. His first Ama Serwa Afrifa, Seven with Christine Afrifa; Baffour Afrifa, Baffour Anokye Afrifa, Maame Drowaa Afrifa, Serwaa Amaniampong Afrifa, Ayowa Afrifa, Sophia Afrifa and Akosua Afrifa. His last son Henry Afrifa was born after his death. Execution =Premonitions= Afrifa had written a letter to Acheampong expressing fears about the future execution of soldiers as a deterrent against the staging of military coups in Ghana, due to the prevailing corruption and indiscipline in the military. This was around the period of the UNIGOV campaign and before Acheampong was removed in a palace coup on 5 July 1978. > I feel greatly disturbed about the future after the government.... In order > to discourage the military from staging coups in the future, how about if > they line all of us up and shot us one by one? I do not certainly want to be > arrested, given some sort of trial and shot. But I would be a stupid General > if I sit in the comfort of my farm and await the VENGEANCE that is about to > be unleashed on us.... I will pray to take away the fear and confusion > weighing on my mind now. Execution After the overthrow of the SMC by the AFRC led by Jerry Rawlings, Afrifa was again arrested on his farm at Mampong. Together with other arrested senior military officers, they were tried to varied extents in camera. They were apparently found guilty of corruption, embezzlement, and using their positions to amass wealth. The investigations carried out were apparently incomplete. Evidence gathered by the National Reconciliation Commission in 2004 also suggests that the others executed were not properly tried. Previously, Afrifa had personally had his assets probed by the independent Sowah Assets Commission without any adverse findings. There also appears to have been a delay to the executions as no one including Rawlings appears to have been ready to sign the death warrants. Lieutenant General Joshua Hamidu, a former Chief of the Defence Staff at the time of the AFRC regime, stated that he and Rawlings were the only soldiers at the center of government who opposed the executions of the former heads of state. He is quoted as saying in response to an accusation of calling for Afrifa's execution that: > That is ridiculous. It is a lie. I had nothing to do with the executions. > For three weeks after the 4 June event, questions were constantly raised > about executing people. I always stood against it. Surprisingly, the only > person who also stood against it was Rawlings. The young boys wanted blood > and I used to tell \\"you cannot resurrect the man once you've killed him. If > you have any case against people, try them. Let everybody hear what they > have done wrong against the country.\\" And that even, they could not do. On 26 June 1979, Afrifa was executed by firing squad, together with General Fred Akuffo, also a former Head of state and Major General Robert Kotei, Colonel Roger Felli, Air Vice Marshal George Yaw Boakye and Rear Admiral Joy Amedume. Reports suggest that Afrifa did not die immediately and had to be shot again. The bodies of the executed officers were buried without ceremony at the Nsawam Prisons Cemetery at Adoagyiri, near Nsawam in the Eastern Region. =Reburial= Following a petition by the widows of the executed generals, President John Kufuor decided that their bodies be returned to their respective families as part of a national reconciliation. On 27 December 2001, the bodies were returned to their respective families in Accra. Afrifa's remains were finally laid to rest at his hometown of Krobo on 28 January 2002.

However, secondary (less prominent but still recognizable and usable) figures include the European Union, the Land, the Ocean, and the inset map, each with its unique corresponding ground. Some features do not have clear figure-ground contrast, such as Europe (dark green+light green+dark gray vs. light gray+white), and can be difficult to perceive unambiguously.Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention.Tait, Alex (2018) Visual Hierarchy and Layout. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (2nd Quarter 2018 Edition), John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: 10.22224/gistbok/2018.2.4 It is thus based on the concept of figure‚Äìground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as Visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes. Related Disciplines and History Fields other than cartography, such as psychology, neurology, and computer science, have studied differentiation of figure from ground. Many studies have employed different experiments, varying the shades, textures, and orientations of test pictures to determine the best method for figure‚Äìground design with mixed results. A current application of figure‚Äìground research is the development of computer vision for robots. By studying the way humans perceive figure and ground, methods can be developed to improve computer vision algorithms.Peter Nordlund, 1998, Figure‚Äìground segmentation using multiple cues, Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Numerical Science and Computing Science, Stockholm University, Stockholm, Sweden. Unlike some of these other applications, in which figures and grounds are discovered in a natural visual field that may or may not have this contrast, in cartography they are intentionally created by design, based on knowledge of the visual perception tendencies of map readers. Since the early days of academic cartography, there has been a recognition of the need for maps to have a conceptual structure. In The Look of Maps (1952), Arthur Robinson emphasized the need for visual contrast in making maps that are clearly organized, including the figure-ground relationship, \\"the visual relation of one or more components to the background on which they are seen.\\"Robinson, Arthur, The Look of Maps, University of Wisconsin Press, 1952, p.69. In 1972, Borden Dent appears to have been the first to use the principles of Perceptual psychology to develop a theory of how the figure-ground relationship emerges on maps (as well as Visual hierarchy), and a set of guidelines for design to strengthen it.. He identified heterogeneity (contrast), Contour (strong edges), Area (size) and Enclosedness (closure) as the primary determinants of figure identification, a model that gained wide support, soon becoming a core principle of the cartographic canon found in textbooks (including his own). He tied it directly to the idea of visual levels, the illusion that some elements on the map appear to float above the page, suggesting that figures are \\"above\\" their ground. This correlation has also gained widespread, if not universal, acceptance, even though there are common situations when figures appear below their ground (such as a river beneath a road network). Further research was largely grounded in Gestalt psychology and Perception, which largely corroborated and expanded upon Dent's model. In summarizing the work to date, MacEachren added Orientation and Convexity to Dent's list, with the acknowledgment that these are relatively minor influences compared to the others.MacEachren, Alan M., How Maps Work, Guilford Press, 1995 MacEachren discussed the concept of visual levels as \\"related,\\" but not equal, to figure- ground contrast. Influences on figure‚Äìground contrast Several visual patterns are believed to contribute to figure-ground contrast, such that features that exhibit these patterns are easier to recognize as figures. These have been largely adopted from Gestalt psychology. In this map, figures like Oman and the Arabian Sea are less obvious due to a lack of differentiation. The Land and the Ocean have strong differentiation, but can be difficult to recognize which is figure because neither is closed. Closure and Centrality makes Oman easier to isolate as a figure than India. * Differentiation or heterogeneity, the amount of difference in appearance between the intended figure and the intended ground.Borden D. Dent, 1972, \\"Visual organization and thematic map design\\", Annals of the Association for American Geographers, p. 79-93. A strong figure looks significantly different than everything in the ground, while the elements of the ground look relatively similar to each other. This can be accomplished using almost any of the visual variables, such as color, size, and texture. Achieving difference is more important than using prescribed design techniques on the figure and ground; for example, a dark figure stands out on a light background just as much as a light figure stands out on a dark background. * Closure, the appearance of a figure to be completely contained within the visual field, and thus entirely surrounded by ground.Arthur Robinson et al., Elements of Cartography, 1995 A figure with closure stands out because it looks like \\"a thing.\\" The proclivity for closed objects is so strong in human visual processing that humans will perceive closure even when figures are only mostly closed. * Centrality, in which features near the center of the visual field (the map) are easier to isolate as figures than features on the edge.Terry A. Slocum, Robert B. McMaster, Fritz C. Kessler, and Hugh H. Howard, 2005, Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization, 2nd ed., Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ The concept of centrality is important because the object located in the center of a map is most often assumed to be the figure. Other map elements can be centered in the remaining visual space after the figure has been centered. * Size, in which smaller elements are more easily recognized as figures than those that fill the visual field. This is one of the few factors in which figure-ground and visual hierarchy have opposite effect. * Interposition is when some features appear to be \\"in front\\" of others in the visual field, with the former partially obscuring the latter. The former thus has a stronger recognition as a figure. This property could be considered a more complex use of closure. * Articulation utilizes texture to differentiate figure from ground. One common example of using articulation on a map is differentiating a continent from the ocean. The ocean, in most cases, will be the ground and the continent will be the figure. By adding fine-textured shading to water, the continent pops out visually as the figure.G. Head, 1972, \\"Land-water differentiation in black and white cartography\\", The Canadian Cartographer, vol. 9, no. 1, p. 25-38. Another method that can be employed for articulation is called vignetting, or the inclusion of brightness gradients at the land- water edge. * Contour is the strength of the boundary or edge of a figure. The figure is formed by a contour or outline (as opposed to an isometric contour line), the common boundary between the figure and ground, usually through a brightness contrast.Alan MacEachren and T.A. Mistrick, \\"The role of brightness differences in figure‚Äìground: is darker figure?\\", The Cartographic Journal, 29:91-100, December 1992. If a figure is not separated entirely from the ground, a simple black contour line can be drawn around the figure enclosing it and thus differentiating it from the ground. Relationship to Visual Hierarchy The concept of figure-ground contrast is often confused with the concept of Visual hierarchy. Both are related elements of map composition, the same design techniques frequently achieve both goals simultaneously, and they are synergistic in that strengthening one typically has the side effect of strengthening the other. The primary difference is in intent. Figure-ground contrast is about making each feature appear distinct from the rest of the features in the map, while visual hierarchy is about making each feature appear more or less important than the rest of the features in the map.Mark Monmonier, 1993, Mapping it Out: Expository Cartography for the Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.

Mitchell biography Education and early life Mitchell was born in Mitcham, Surrey on 29 September 1920. His parents were Christopher Gibbs Mitchell, a civil servant, and Kate Beatrice Dorothy (n√©e) Taplin. His uncle was Sir Godfrey Way Mitchell, chairman of George Wimpey. He was educated at Queen's College, Taunton and Jesus College, Cambridge where he studied the Natural Sciences Tripos specialising in Biochemistry. He was appointed a research post in the Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge, in 1942, and was awarded a Ph.D. in early 1951 for work on the mode of action of penicillin. Career and research In 1955 he was invited by Professor Michael Swann to set up a biochemical research unit, called the Chemical Biology Unit, in the Department of Zoology, at the University of Edinburgh, where he was appointed a Senior Lecturer in 1961, then Reader in 1962, although institutional opposition to his work coupled with ill health led to his resignation in 1963. From 1963 to 1965, he supervised the restoration of a Regency-fronted Mansion, known as Glynn House, at Cardinham near Bodmin, Cornwall - adapting a major part of it for use as a research laboratory. He and his former research colleague, Jennifer Moyle founded a charitable company, known as Glynn Research Ltd., to promote fundamental biological research at Glynn House and they embarked on a programme of research on chemiosmotic reactions and reaction systems. =Chemiosmotic hypothesis= Oxidative phosphorylation In the 1960s, ATP was known to be the energy currency of life, but the mechanism by which ATP was created in the mitochondria was assumed to be by substrate-level phosphorylation. Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis was the basis for understanding the actual process of oxidative phosphorylation. At the time, the biochemical mechanism of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation was unknown. Mitchell realised that the movement of ions across an electrochemical potential difference could provide the energy needed to produce ATP. His hypothesis was derived from information that was well known in the 1960s. He knew that living cells had a membrane potential; interior negative to the environment. The movement of charged ions across a membrane is thus affected by the electrical forces (the attraction of positive to negative charges). Their movement is also affected by thermodynamic forces, the tendency of substances to diffuse from regions of higher concentration. He went on to show that ATP synthesis was coupled to this electrochemical gradient. His hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery of ATP synthase, a membrane-bound protein that uses the potential energy of the electrochemical gradient to make ATP; and by the discovery by Andr√© Jagendorf that a pH difference across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast results in ATP synthesis.  Protonmotive Q-cycle  Later, Peter Mitchell also hypothesized some of the complex details of electron transport chains. He conceived of the coupling of proton pumping to quinone-based electron bifurcation, which contributes to the proton motive force and thus, ATP synthesis. =Awards and honours= In 1978 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his contribution to the understanding of biological energy transfer through the formulation of the chemiosmotic theory.\\"} including the Nobel Lecture on December 8, 1978 David Keilin‚Äôs Respiratory Chain Concept and Its Chemiosmotic Consequences He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974.

A password policy is often part of an organization's official regulations and may be taught as part of security awareness training. Either the password policy is merely advisory, or the computer systems force users to comply with it. Some governments have national authentication frameworksImproving Usability of Password Management with Standardized Password Policies. Retrieved on 2012-10-12. that define requirements for user authentication to government services, including requirements for passwords. NIST guidelines The United States Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has put out two standards for password policies which have been widely followed. =2013= From 2013, the ‚ÄúNIST Special Publication 800-63. Appendix A,‚Äù advised people to use irregular capitalization, special characters, and at least one numeral. It also recommended changing passwords regularly, at least every 90 days. This was the advice that most systems followed, and was \\"baked into\\" a number of standards that businesses needed to follow. =2017= However, in 2017 a major update changed this advice, particularly that forcing complexity and regular changes. The key points of these are: *Verifiers should not impose composition rules e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters *Verifiers should not require passwords to be changed arbitrarily or regularly e.g. the previous 90 day rule * Passwords must be at least 8 characters in length * Password systems should permit subscriber-chosen passwords at least 64 characters in length. *All printing ASCII characters, the space character, and Unicode characters should be acceptable in passwords *When establishing or changing passwords, the verifier shall advise the subscriber that they need to select a different password if they have chosen a weak or compromised password *Verifiers should offer guidance such as a password-strength meter, to assist the user in choosing a strong password *Verifiers shall store passwords in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords shall be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function. Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive. NIST included a rationale for the new guidelines in its Appendix A. Aspects Typical components of a password policy include: =Password length and formation= Many policies require a minimum password length. Eight characters is typical but may not be appropriate. Longer passwords are generally more secure, but some systems impose a maximum length for compatibility with legacy systems. Some policies suggest or impose requirements on what type of password a user can choose, such as: *the use of both upper-case and lower-case letters (case sensitivity) *inclusion of one or more numerical digits *inclusion of special characters, such as @, #, $ *prohibition of words found in a password blocklist *prohibition of words found in the user's personal information *prohibition of use of company name or an abbreviation *prohibition of passwords that match the format of calendar dates, license plate numbers, telephone numbers, or other common numbers Other systems create an initial password for the user; but require then to change it to one of their own choosing within a short interval. =Password block list= Password block lists are lists of passwords that are always blocked from use. Block lists contain passwords constructed of character combinations that otherwise meet company policy, but should no longer be used because they have been deemed insecure for one or more reasons, such as being easily guessed, following a common pattern, or public disclosure from previous data breaches. Common examples are Password1, Qwerty123, or Qaz123wsx. =Password duration= Some policies require users to change passwords periodically, often every 90 or 180 days. The benefit of password expiration, however, is debatable. Systems that implement such policies sometimes prevent users from picking a password too close to a previous selection. This policy can often backfire. Some users find it hard to devise \\"good\\" passwords that are also easy to remember, so if people are required to choose many passwords because they have to change them often, they end up using much weaker passwords; the policy also encourages users to write passwords down. Also, if the policy prevents a user from repeating a recent password, this requires that there is a database in existence of everyone's recent passwords (or their hashes) instead of having the old ones erased from memory. Finally, users may change their password repeatedly within a few minutes, and then change back to the one they really want to use, circumventing the password change policy altogether. The human aspects of passwords must also be considered. Unlike computers, human users cannot delete one memory and replace it with another. Consequently, frequently changing a memorized password is a strain on the human memory, and most users resort to choosing a password that is relatively easy to guess (See Password fatigue). Users are often advised to use mnemonic devices to remember complex passwords. However, if the password must be repeatedly changed, mnemonics are useless because the user would not remember which mnemonic to use. Furthermore, the use of mnemonics (leading to passwords such as \\"2BOrNot2B\\") makes the password easier to guess. Administration factors can also be an issue. Users sometimes have older devices that require a password that was used before the password duration expired. In order to manage these older devices, users may have to resort to writing down all old passwords in case they need to log into an older device. Requiring a very strong password and not requiring it be changed is often better. However, this approach does have a major drawback: if an unauthorized person acquires a password and uses it without being detected, that person may have access for an indefinite period. It is necessary to weigh these factors: the likelihood of someone guessing a password because it is weak, versus the likelihood of someone managing to steal, or otherwise acquire without guessing, a stronger password. Bruce Schneier argues that \\"pretty much anything that can be remembered can be cracked\\", and recommends a scheme that uses passwords which will not appear in any dictionaries. =Sanction= Password policies may include progressive sanctions beginning with warnings and ending with possible loss of computer privileges or job termination. Where confidentiality is mandated by law, e.g. with classified information, a violation of password policy could be a criminal offense. Some consider a convincing explanation of the importance of security to be more effective than threats of sanctions. Selection process The level of password strength required depends, among other things, on how easy it is for an attacker to submit multiple guesses. Some systems limit the number of times a user can enter an incorrect password before some delay is imposed or the account is frozen. At the other extreme, some systems make available a specially hashed version of the password, so that anyone can check its validity. When this is done, an attacker can try passwords very rapidly; so much stronger passwords are necessary for reasonable security. (See password cracking and password length equation.) Stricter requirements are also appropriate for accounts with higher privileges, such as root or system administrator accounts. =Usability considerations= Password policies are usually a tradeoff between theoretical security and the practicalities of human behavior. For example: *Requiring excessively complex passwords and forcing them to be changed frequently can cause users to write passwords down in places that are easy for an intruder to find, such as a Rolodex or post-it note near the computer. *Users often have dozens of passwords to manage. It may be more realistic to recommend a single password be used for all low security applications, such as reading on-line newspapers and accessing entertainment web sites. *Similarly, demanding that users never write down their passwords may be unrealistic and lead users to choose weak ones (or cause a lot of inconvenience when users forget their password). An alternative is to suggest keeping written passwords in a secure place, such as a safe or an encrypted master file. The validity of this approach depends on what the most likely threat is deemed to be. While writing down a password may be problematic if potential attackers have access to the secure store, if the threat is primarily remote attackers who do not have access to the store, it can be a very secure method. *Inclusion of special characters can be a problem if a user has to log onto a computer in a different country. Some special characters may be difficult or impossible to find on keyboards designed for another language. *Some identity management systems allow self-service password reset, where users can bypass password security by supplying an answer to one or more security questions such as \\"where were you born?\\", \\"what's your favorite movie?\\", etc. Often the answers to these questions can easily be obtained by social engineering, phishing or simple research. A 2010 examination of the password policiesWhere do security polices come from? Proc. Symp. Usable Privacy and Security, 2010 of 75 different websites concludes that security only partly explains more stringent policies: monopoly providers of a service, such as government sites, have more stringent policies than sites where consumers have choice (e.g. retail sites and banks). The study concludes that sites with more stringent policies \\"do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences from poor usability.\\" Other approaches are available that are generally considered to be more secure than simple passwords. These include use of a security token or one-time password system, such as S/Key, or multi- factor authentication. However, these systems heighten the tradeoff between security and convenience: according to Shuman Ghosemajumder, these systems all improve security, but come \\"at the cost of moving the burden to the end user.\\" Enforcing a policy The more complex a password policy, the harder it may be to enforce, due to user difficulty in remembering or choosing a suitable password. Most companies will require users to familiarize themselves with any password policy, much in the same way a company would require employees to be aware of Health & Safety regulations, or building fire exits, however it is often difficult to ensure that the relevant policies are actually being followed without systems in place that automatically enforce the policy. Many systems, such as Microsoft Windows, require passwords have built-in methods of enforcing the set policy. This is the only reliable way to ensure that the policy is being followed.

It describes the activities to be performed and the results that have to be produced during product development. The left side of the \\"V\\" represents the decomposition of requirements, and creation of system specifications. The right side of the \\"V\\" represents integration of parts and their validation.Forsberg, K. and Mooz, H., \\"The Relationship of Systems Engineering to the Project Cycle\\" , First Annual Symposium of the National Council On Systems Engineering (NCOSE), October 1991 However, requirements need to be validated first against the higher level requirements or user needs. Furthermore, there is also something as validation of system models (e.g. FEM). This can partially be done at the left side also. To claim that validation only occurs at the right side may not be correct. The easiest way is to say that verification is always against the requirements (technical terms) and validation always against the real world or the user needs. The Aerospace standard RTCA DO-178B states that requirements are validated‚Äîconfirmed to be true‚Äîand the end product is verified to ensure it satisfies those requirements. Validation can be expressed by the query \\"Are you building the right thing?\\" and verification by \\"Are you building it right?\\"  Types  There are three general types of V-model. = V-Modell = The German V-Model \\"V-Modell\\", the official project management method of the German government. It is roughly equivalent to PRINCE2, but more directly relevant to software development.\\"V-Modell site (in German)\\", accessed July 10, 2020. The key attribute of using a \\"V\\" representation was to require proof that the products from the left-side of the V were acceptable by the appropriate test and integration organization implementing the right-side of the V.German Directive 250, Software Development Standard for the German Federal Armed Forces, V-Model, Software Lifecycle Process Model, August 1992 = General testing = Throughout the testing community worldwide, the V-model is widely seen as a vaguer illustrative depiction of the software development process as described in the International Software Testing Qualifications Board Foundation Syllabus for software testers.\\"International Software Testing Qualifications Board ‚Äì Foundation Level Syllabus\\", accessed January 9, 2013. There is no single definition of this model, which is more directly covered in the alternative article on the V-Model (software development). = US government standard = The US also has a government standard V-model which dates back about 20 years like its German counterpart. Its scope is a narrower systems development lifecycle model, but far more detailed and more rigorous than most UK practitioners and testers would understand by the V-model.\\"US Dept of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Systems Engineering Guidebook for ITS\\", accessed January 9, 2013.Forsberg, K., Mooz, H., Cotterman, H. Visualizing Project Management, 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, NY, 2005. Pages 108-116, 242-248, 341-360.International Council On Systems Engineering (INCOSE), Systems Engineering Handbook Version 3.1, August 2007, pages 3.3 to 3.8  Validation vs. verification  It is sometimes said that validation can be expressed by the query \\"Are you building the right thing?\\" and verification by \\"Are you building it right?\\" In practice, the usage of these terms varies. The PMBOK guide, also adopted by the IEEE as a standard (jointly maintained by INCOSE, the Systems engineering Research Council SERC, and IEEE Computer Society) defines them as follows in its 4th edition: * \\"Validation. The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with verification.\\" * \\"Verification. The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with validation.\\"  Objectives  The V-model provides guidance for the planning and realization of projects. The following objectives are intended to be achieved by a project execution: * Minimization of project risks: The V-model improves project transparency and project control by specifying standardized approaches and describing the corresponding results and responsible roles. It permits an early recognition of planning deviations and risks and improves process management, thus reducing the project risk. * Improvement and guarantee of quality: As a standardized process model, the V-Model ensures that the results to be provided are complete and have the desired quality. Defined interim results can be checked at an early stage. Uniform product contents will improve readability, understandability and verifiability. * Reduction of total cost over the entire project and system life cycle: The effort for the development, production, operation and maintenance of a system can be calculated, estimated and controlled in a transparent manner by applying a standardized process model. The results obtained are uniform and easily retraced. This reduces the acquirer's dependency on the supplier and the effort for subsequent activities and projects. * Improvement of communication between all stakeholders: The standardized and uniform description of all relevant elements and terms is the basis for the mutual understanding between all stakeholders. Thus, the frictional loss between user, acquirer, supplier and developer is reduced.  V-model topics  Systems engineering and verification.Systems Engineering Fundamentals. Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001. = Systems engineering and verification = The systems engineering process (SEP) provides a path for improving the cost-effectiveness of complex systems as experienced by the system owner over the entire life of the system, from conception to retirement. It involved early and comprehensive identification of goals, a concept of operations that describes user needs and the operating environment, thorough and testable system requirements, detailed design, implementation, rigorous acceptance testing of the implemented system to ensure it meets the stated requirements (system verification), measuring its effectiveness in addressing goals (system validation), on-going operation and maintenance, system upgrades over time, and eventual retirement. The process emphasizes requirements-driven design and testing. All design elements and acceptance tests must be traceable to one or more system requirements and every requirement must be addressed by at least one design element and acceptance test. Such rigor ensures nothing is done unnecessarily and everything that is necessary is accomplished. = The two streams =  Specification stream  The specification stream mainly consists of: * User requirement specifications * Functional requirement specifications * Design specifications  Testing stream  The testing stream generally consists of: * Installation qualification (IQ) * Operational qualification (OQ) * Performance qualification (PQ) The development stream can consist (depending on the system type and the development scope) of customization, configuration or coding.  Applications  Off-Core alternatives (illustrating upward and downward iterations and Time and Maturity dimension). Source - K. Forsberg and H. Mooz 2004 The V-model is used to regulate the software development process within the German federal administration. Nowadays it is still the standard for German federal administration and defense projects, as well as software developers within the region. The concept of the V-model was developed simultaneously, but independently, in Germany and in the United States in the late 1980s: * The German V-model was originally developed by IABG in Ottobrunn, near Munich, in cooperation with the Federal Office for Defense Technology and Procurement in Koblenz, for the Federal Ministry of Defense. It was taken over by the Federal Ministry of the Interior for the civilian public authorities domain in summer 1992. * The US V-model, as documented in the 1991 proceedings for the National Council on Systems Engineering (NCOSE; now INCOSE as of 1995), was developed for satellite systems involving hardware, software, and human interaction. * The V-model first appeared at Hughes Aircraft circa 1982 as part of the pre-proposal effort for the FAA Advanced Automation System (AAS) program. It eventually formed the test strategy for the Hughes AAS Design Competition Phase (DCP) proposal. It was created to show the test and integration approach which was driven by new challenges to surface latent defects in the software. The need for this new level of latent defect detection was driven by the goal to start automating the thinking and planning processes of the air traffic controller as envisioned by the automated enroute air traffic control (AERA) program. The reason the V is so powerful comes from the Hughes culture of coupling all text and analysis to multi dimensional images. It was the foundation of Sequential Thematic Organization of Publications (STOP) created by Hughes in 1963 and used until Hughes was divested by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1985. * The US Department of Defense puts the systems engineering process interactions into a V-model relationship. It has now found widespread application in commercial as well as defense programs. Its primary use is in project management and throughout the project lifecycle. One fundamental characteristic of the US V-model is that time and maturity move from left to right and one cannot move back in time. All iteration is along a vertical line to higher or lower levels in the system hierarchy, as shown in the figure. This has proven to be an important aspect of the model. The expansion of the model to a dual-Vee concept is treated in reference. As the V-model is publicly available many companies also use it. In project management it is a method comparable to PRINCE2 and describes methods for project management as well as methods for system development. The V-Model, while rigid in process, can be very flexible in application, especially as it pertains to the scope outside of the realm of the System Development Lifecycle normal parameters.  Advantages  These are the advantages V-model offers in front of other systems development models: * The users of the V-model participate in the development and maintenance of the V-model. A change control board publicly maintains the V-Model. The change control board meets anywhere from every day to weekly and processes all change requests received during system development and test. * The V-model provides concrete assistance on how to implement an activity and its work steps, defining explicitly the events needed to complete a work step: each activity schema contains instructions, recommendations and detailed explanations of the activity.  Limits  The following aspects are not covered by the V-model, they must be regulated in addition, or the V-Model must be adapted accordingly:Christian Bucanac, The V-Model * The placing of contracts for services is not regulated. * The organization and execution of operation, maintenance, repair and disposal of the system are not covered by the V-model. However, planning and preparation of a concept for these tasks are regulated in the V-model. * The V-model addresses software development within a project rather than a whole organization.

CGIS was used to store geospatial data for the Canada Land Inventory and assisted in the development of regulatory procedures for land- use management and resource monitoring in Canada. At that time, Canada was beginning to realize problems associated with its large land mass and attempting to discern the availability of natural resources. The federal government decided to launch a national program to assist in management and inventory of its resources. The simple automated computer processes designed to store and process large amounts of data enabled Canada to begin a national land-use management program and become a foremost promoter of geographic information systems (GIS). CGIS was designed to withstand great amounts of collected data by managing, modeling, and analyzing this data very quickly and accurately. As Canada presented such large geospatial datasets, it was necessary to be able to focus on certain regions or provinces in order to more effectively manage and maintain land-use. CGIS enabled its users to effectively collect national data and, if necessary, break it down into provincial datasets. Early applications of CGIS benefited land-use management and environmental impact monitoring programs across Canada. Development In 1960, Roger Tomlinson was working at Spartan Air Services, an aerial survey company based in Ottawa, Ontario. The company was focused on producing large- scale photogrammetric and geophysical maps, mostly for the Government of Canada. In the early 1960s, Tomlinson and the company were asked to produce a map for site-location analysis in an east African nation. Tomlinson immediately recognized that the new automated computer technologies might be applicable and even necessary to complete such a detail-oriented task more effectively and efficiently than humans. Eventually, Spartan met with IBM offices in Ottawa to begin developing a relationship to bridge the previous gap between geographic data and computer services. Tomlinson brought his geographic knowledge to the table as IBM brought computer programming and data management. The Government of Canada began working towards the development of a national program after a 1962 meeting between Tomlinson and Lee Pratt, head of the Canada Land Inventory (CLI). Pratt was charged with creation of maps covering the entire region of Canada's commercially productive areas by showing agriculture, forestry, wildlife, and recreation, all with the same classification schemes. Not only was the development of such maps a formidable task, but Pratt understood that computer automation may assist in the analytical processes as well. Tomlinson was the first to produce a technical feasibility study on whether computer mapping programs would be a viable solution for the land-use inventory and management programs, such as CLI. He is also given credit for coining the term \\"geographic information system\\" and is recognized as the \\"Modern Father of GIS.\\" CGIS continued to be developed and operated as a stand alone system by the Government of Canada until the late 1980s, at which point the widespread emergence of commercial GIS software slowly rendered it obsolete. In the early 1990s, a group of volunteers successfully extracted all of the data from the old computer tapes, and the data made available on GeoGratis.

They are native to eastern Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and southeastern Europe. It includes the blind mole-rats, bamboo rats, mole-rats, and zokors. This family represents the oldest split (excluding perhaps the Platacanthomyidae) in the muroid superfamily, and comprises animals adapted to a subterranean way of life. These rodents were thought to have evolved adaptations to living underground independently until recent genetic studies demonstrated they form a monophyletic group. Members of the Spalacidae are often placed in the family Muridae along with all other members of the Muroidea. Characteristics Spalacids are mouse- to rat-sized rodents, adapted to burrowing and living underground. They have short limbs, wedge-shaped skulls, strong neck muscles, large incisor teeth, and small eyes and external ears. In the zokors, which dig primarily with their feet, rather than their teeth, the front claws are also massively enlarged. These features are least extreme in the bamboo rats, which spend at least some of their time above ground, foraging for food. They are most highly developed in the blind mole-rats, whose eyes are completely covered by skin, and entirely lack external ears or tails. All of the spalacid species dig extensive burrows, which may include storage chambers for food, latrine chambers, and breeding nests. They are generally solitary animals, and do not share their tunnel complexes with other individuals. All the species are herbivores, feeding on roots, bulbs, and tubers. They give birth to litters of up to six young after a gestation period between three and seven weeks, depending on the species. As with many other muroids, the young are born blind, hairless, and helpless. They may stay with the mother for several months before setting off to establish their own burrows, although some species disperse as soon as they are weaned. =Characteristics= Norris et al. listed several characteristics present in all members of this family which distinguish them from the rest of the muroids, (the clade Eumuroida). These are \\"the reduction or absence of external eyes, reduced pinnae, stocky body, short tail (<50% head and body length), broad rostrum, triangular-shaped braincase, infraorbital canal ovoid shape and does not extend ventrally to the roof of the palate, zygomatic plate absent or much reduced, nasolacrimal canal inside infraorbital canal, incisive foramina small to medium-sized, extensive neck musculature and prominent points of attachment on the occipitum, minimal reduction in M3 relative to M1 and M2, and a distinct orientation of the manubrium of the malleus bone.\\" Classification The spalacids are classified in three subfamilies, six genera, and 37 species.

He was the second son of King Sinmun, and the younger brother of King Hyoso. In 704 Seongdeok married Lady Baeso Èô™Êò≠Â§´‰∫∫ (Queen Seongjeong ÊàêË≤û), the daughter of Gim Wontae. In 715 their son, Junggyeong ÈáçÊÖ∂, was named Crown Prince and heir presumptive. Shortly thereafter, and for reasons unclear but quite likely having to do with a power struggle at court between the king and the clan of the queen, Queen Seongjeong was evicted from the palace in 716. As further evidence of a possible power struggle, the next year Junggyeong died under circumstances that remain unknown. Following the fall from favor of his first wife, King Seongdeog married Sodeok in 720, the daughter of the minister Gim Sun-won. Kings Hyoseong and Gyeongdeok were among the children of Seongdeok and Sodeok. Despite suggestions of continued power struggles between aristocratic and royal prerogative, the reign of King Seongdeok is seen by most Korean scholars as the apogee of the Unified Silla state. Relations between Silla and Tang China reached unparalleled levels of cooperation. This accommodation following years of confrontation and competition over hegemony in Korea had much to do with Tang‚Äòs realization that Silla would prove more valuable as an ally on its flank than as a rival, during a period when Tang was facing continued challenges to its authority in the far west and on the northern steppes ‚Äì by Tibet, the Malgal, dynamic Islamic forces emerging out of Central Asia, as well as the state of Balhae, which had emerged in the late 7th century from the ruins of the old Goguryeo state. Indeed, troubled by an increasingly confrontational Balhae (which had actually launched a seaborne attack against Tang in 733), in 733 the Tang emperor Xuanzong enfeoffed King Seongdeok as Military Commander of Ninghai (Ninghai junshi ÂØßÊµ∑Ëªç‰Ωø) with orders to chastise the Balhae/Malgal state. Though King Seongdeok did in fact launch a northern campaign that same year, it was foiled by a blizzard. Silla, too, was concerned by the Balhae resurgence. In 721 King Seongdeok ordered the construction of a great wall across Silla‚Äòs northern border. Remnants of this wall can still be seen in what is today South Hamgy«íng province, North Korea. Plagued as well by the raids of Japanese pirates along the southern coast, the following year (and quite likely with the same laborers) Seongdeok also had a large fortress erected near the capital of Gyeongju that extended ten kilometers in circumference. According to the Samguk Yusa, a 13th-century Korean record of history and fable that deals with the period in question, the fortress (known as Mobeol prefectural fortress) required the labor of nearly 40,000 men, a massive mustering of manpower that is testimony of the increasing power of the centralized monarchy. The reign of Seongdeok also bears evidence of continued attempts at reforming the land system of Silla. The dispersal of ‚Äúable‚Äìbodied land‚Äù (jeongjeon ‰∏ÅÁî∞) is first mentioned as taking place in the twenty‚Äìfirst year of King Seongdeok (722). The exact nature of able‚Äìbodied land is disputed since almost no corroborating evidence remains. However, based on the title, it would seem to be land distributed to able bodied commoners, though whether to work or own outright is unclear. In any case, whatever its precise nature, it would appear to be an attempt to buttress royal authority by nurturing relations with the peasantry at the expense of the land holding aristocracy. In fitting culmination to Seongdeok‚Äòs reign, and symptomatic of improving relations with Tang, in 735 Tang Emperor Xuanzong formally granted the Silla king the territory south of the Pae River (the modern Taedong River running through Pyongyang), land that had been held at least formally by Tang ever since the 7th century and the Tang‚ÄìSilla campaigns that had toppled Goguryeo. Seongdeok‚Äòs reign was one of relative prosperity and peace. As one Korean scholar has contended, during his rule \\"...the paramount authority of the throne was finally secured, and with this accomplished the kingdom at last was able to enjoy unaccustomed domestic tranquility.\\".Lee, Ki‚Äìbaik, A New History of Korea. Tr. by E.W. Wagner & E.J. Shultz, based on the Korean rev. ed. of 1979. (Seoul: Ilchogak, 1984). According to one account in the Samguk Sagi, Seongdeok invented Korea's first water clock, in Korean nugak ÊºèÂàª, in 718. However, this is likely a mistaken rendering of Nugakjeon ÊºèÂàªÂÖ∏, for elsewhere the Samguk Sagi relates that in 718 was established for the first time the Nugakjeon, or Office of Timekeeping. Regarding the death date of Seongdeok, as period Chinese histories record that in the second month of 737 a Tang envoy was dispatched to confer investiture upon Seongdeok's successor (later King Hyoseong) as King of Silla, it has been posited that King Seongdeok in fact died in 736.Michael C.

The AT-17 was powered by two Jacobs R-755-9 radial engines. The commercial version was the Model T-50, from which the AT-17 was developed. Design and development A T-50 in flight The AT-17 was a military version of the commercial Cessna T-50 light transport. The Cessna Airplane Company first produced the wood and tubular steel, fabric-covered T-50 in 1939 for the civilian market, as a lightweight and low-cost twin for personal use where larger aircraft such as the Beech 18 would be too expensive. A low-wing cantilever monoplane, it featured retractable main landing gear and wing trailing edge flaps, both electrically actuated. The wing structure was built up of laminated spruce spar beams with spruce and plywood ribs. The fixed tailwheel is not steerable and full-swivelling. The prototype T-50 made its maiden flight on 26 March 1939.Wixley 1984, p.13. In 1940, the United States Army Air Corps ordered them under the designation AT-8 as twin-engined advanced trainers. Operational history UC-78 in flight Thirty-three AT-8s were built for the U.S. Army Air Corps, and production continued under the designation AT-17 reflecting a change in equipment and engine types. In 1942, the U.S. Army Air Force (the successor to the Air Corps from June 1941) adopted the Bobcat as a light personnel transport and those delivered after January 1, 1943 were designated UC-78s. By the end of World War II, Cessna had produced more than 4,600 Bobcats for the U.S. military, 67 of which were transferred to the United States Navy as JRC-1s. In addition, 822 Bobcats had been produced for the Royal Canadian Air Force as Crane Is, many of which were used in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.Phillips, Edward H: Cessna, A Master's Expression, Flying Books, 1985. The aircraft did not last long in North American postwar military service. Few (if any) Bobcats were in service with the United States Air Force when it was formed in September, 1947. Surviving military aircraft were declared obsolete in 1949.Swanborough, Gordon & Bowers, Peter M: United States Military Aircraft Since 1909, Putnam, 1989. Dubbed the \\"Bamboo Bomber\\" by the pilots who flew them, it was one of the aircraft featured in the popular television series Sky King of the early-to- mid 1950s. The aircraft was replaced in later episodes by the T-50's successor, the all-metal Cessna 310. After the war, surplus AT-17s and UC-78s could be converted by CAA-approved kits to civilian-standard aircraft allowing their certification under the T-50s original Type Certificate (ATC- 722, issued 3-24-1940).Juptner, Joseph P: U.S. Civil Aircraft Series, Vol 8, TAB Books, 1994. They were used by small airlines, charter and \\"bush\\" operators and private pilots. Some were operated on floats. By the 1970s, the number of airworthy aircraft had dwindled as they were made obsolete by more modern types and by the maintenance required by their aging wood wing structures and fabric covering. Since then, several have been restored by antique airplane enthusiasts. As of December 2017, FAA records show 52 T-50s, two AT-17s, and five UC-78s listed on its registration database. In the postwar years, Bobcats continued in military service with Brazil and the Nationalist Chinese.

Throughout her life, she composed her poems in English, British Sign Language, and American Sign Language. Her work laid the foundations for modern sign language poetry in the US and UK. She is regarded as the pioneer of BSL poetry and her work influenced many contemporary Deaf poets. The Dorothy Miles Cultural Centre was a well-loved organisation based in Surrey, spreading British Sign Language and raising Deaf Awareness in the community. This mantle was taken up by Dot Sign Language who took over when the Cultural Centre closed. Dot Sign Language continues to teach qualifying British Sign Language courses in Woking and Guildford, as well as Deaf Awareness workplace training. They spend many hours working in the community, in Schools, Scout troops, Brownies and all other youth groups, so that all youngsters can see BSL in action, in real life and interact with Deaf people. They have such a high pass rate and such outstandingly successful teaching methods that they were shortlisted for award and recognition in January 2017 by the examining body 'Signature'.  Biography  Miles (n√©e Squire) was born 19 August 1931 in Holywell, Flintshire, North Wales, daughter of James and Amy Squire (n√©e Brick). She was the youngest of five surviving children. In 1939 she contracted cerebrospinal meningitis which left her deaf. She was educated at the Royal School for the Deaf and the Mary Hare School. In 1957, at the age of 25, she went to America to take up a place at Gallaudet College, sponsored in part by the British Deaf and Dumb Association. During her time at the college she became the first member of a junior class to be a member of the Gallaudet Phi Alpha Pi honour society, was in the 1961 edition of \\"Who's Who in American Colleges and Universities\\", edited the student magazines and won prizes for both her prose writing and poetry and for acting. Some of her work was published in \\"The Silent Muse\\", an anthology of selected writings by deaf authors of the last 100 years. She also wrote the Bison's song. She married a fellow student, Robert Thomas Miles in September 1958. They separated in 1959. She graduated in 1961 receiving a BA with distinction. She worked in the United States as a teacher and counsellor for deaf adults. In 1967, she joined the newly founded National Theatre of the Deaf and began to create sign language poetry that deaf people - as well as hearing people ‚Äì could appreciate. In 1975, Miles left the NTD to work with the campus service for the deaf at California State University, Northridge. She returned to live in England in the autumn of 1977, after twenty years in America. Dot was soon involved in the National Union of the Deaf's Open Door (BBC TV) pioneering television programme (in which she performed her poem Language for the Eye) and was involved in discussions that led to the See Hear television series. She took work with the British Deaf Association, working on various projects. She compiled the first teaching manual for BSL tutors and became involved in setting up the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP). She also worked on the BDA dictionary. For a while she worked as a self-employed writer, lecturer and performer, becoming involved in promotion of sign language teaching and training of tutors and deaf theatre. She was involved in setting up and then teaching on the British Sign Language Tutor Training Course - the first university course for training deaf people to become BSL tutors. She also wrote the best-selling BBC book BSL - A beginner's guide, which was published to complement the television series. By the early 1990s, Miles was a key figure in the British Deaf Community. She died on 30 January 1993 when she fell from the window of her second floor flat. The inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court concluded that she took her own life while depressed.  Legacy  Miles is regarded as a key figure in the literary heritage of sign language and the deaf community. It has been suggested that she is the source of most of the sign language poetry performed today. She was passionate about deaf issues, culture and sign language and longed to bridge the gap between deaf and hearing people. The Dorothy Miles Cultural Centre was established by a group of both Deaf and hearing friends in her memory. She features as one of a series of portraits of notable deaf artists painted by Nancy Rourke.

It reads \\"Criticize Lin, criticize Confucius - it's the most important matter for the whole party, the whole army and the people of the whole country.\\" The Criticize Lin (Biao), Criticize Confucius Campaign () (also called the Anti-Lin Biao, Anti-Confucius campaign) was a political propaganda campaign started by Mao Zedong and his wife, Jiang Qing, the leader of the Gang of Four. It lasted from 1973 until the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1976. The campaign produced detailed Maoist interpretations of Chinese history, and was used as a tool by the Gang of Four to attack their enemies. The campaign continued in several phases, beginning as an academic attempt to interpret Chinese history according to Mao's political theories. In 1974 the campaign was joined with another, pre-existent campaign to attack Lin Biao, who had allegedly attempted to assassinate Mao in a failed coup before his death in 1971. In early 1975 the campaign was modified to indirectly attack China's Premier, Zhou Enlai, and other senior Chinese leaders. In mid-1975 the Gang of Four introduced debate on Water Margin as a tool to attack their enemies. The campaign only ended in 1976, when the Gang of Four were arrested, ending the Cultural Revolution. Stages of the campaign The events that occurred during the \\"Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius\\" campaign were \\"complex and often confusing\\", but can be identified as occurring through four main phases. The first phase of the campaign began after the 1st Plenary Session of the 10th CCP Central Committee, in 1973. Following this session, Mao encouraged public discussions focused on criticizing Confucius and Confucianism, and on interpreting aspects of historical Chinese society within a Maoist theoretical perspective. These initial debates focused on interpreting the issues of slavery, feudalism, and the relationship between Confucianism and Legalism according to the social theories published by Mao and Karl Marx.Hsiung 637 In late 1973 - early 1974 begins the second phase of the campaign, when as the main critics of Confucius were the masses. The universities were organized special courses, preparing a program of criticism of certain provisions of the Confucius used by Lin Biao. Tens of thousands of workers and peasants were trained in these courses, swelling the ranks of \\"Marxist theoretician.\\"Fractures LS Confucianism and Legalism in the political history of China. - M., 1981 - S. 263 The attacks on Confucius merged with a pre-existent campaign to criticize Lin Biao. With the deployment of the campaign it became clear that \\"criticism of Lin Biao and Confucius\\" was directed not so much against the \\"enemies of the past,\\" as against the \\"enemies of today.\\" During this phase, Mao's image was identified with that of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang (glossed as an anti-Confucian Legalist). Hyperbolic praise was given to Qin based on his popular association with Mao.Hsiung 637-638 In the article \\"What kind of man Confucius\\", published in the seventh issue of the Red Flag magazine in 1974, paint a portrait of the ancient sage who reminds the reader of Zhou Enlai.Delyusin LP Campaign \\"criticize Lin Biao and Confucius\\" in China (1973-1975 years) ... - M., 2004.- 158 pp Based on People's Daily articles, Russian researcher Leo Delyusin believed that locals formally belonging to the campaign \\"criticize Lin Biao and Confucius\\" sabotaged it. It was clear that Beijing was not satisfied with the progress of the campaign, and from time to time Beijing heard complaints and accusations at those who tried to change the direction of the campaign and give it a different shape, different goals. The attempts to disrupt and distort the meaning of the campaign against Lin Biao and Confucius combined with a formal public statement about the importance of the campaign, and in practice - curtail it and to address specific cases. Delyusin LP Campaign \\"criticize Lin Biao and Confucius\\" in China (1973-1975 years) ... - M., 2004.- 179 pp Under the guise of criticism of the ideas of Confucius education, Tang Xiaowen in the article \\"I was popular educator Confucius?\\", attacked those who moved away from the installations of the \\"cultural revolution.\\" He tried to prove that in the saying of Confucius' all \\"contained class meaning\\", and had a detrimental effect on the organization of the education system, serving as the basis of the revisionist line. Declaring that \\"Confucius harbored a fierce hatred of the social changes of the time,\\" the author attributed his intention \\"to make all slaves China obedient and submissive.\\" In his school, \\"he picked up the students with the intention to train \\"humane\\", \\"purposeful,\\" \\"noble,\\" \\"virtuous \\"men who adhere strictly to\\" the orders of the Zhou Dynasty, and having achieved success in their studies, would be officials and promoted to thereby restore the slave system of the Western Zhou\\".Delyusin LP Campaign \\"criticize Lin Biao and Confucius\\" in China (1973-1975 years) ... - Moscow, 2004 .. - P. 164 In the criticism of the private schools established by Confucius, aimed at the restoration of the old order, the Chinese reader found the familiar features of the \\"reactionary political line in the field of education\\". The third phase began after Zhou Enlai reorganized the State Council during the 4th National People's Congress, in January 1975. At the People's Congress, Zhou Enlai brought many cadres back to work who had been purged during the 1966-1969 phase of the Cultural Revolution. In comparison with the first stage of the \\"cultural revolution\\", the rehabilitated leaders led by Premier Zhou Enlai already had sufficient influence in the center. Feeling strong support from his supporters on 31 January 1974 at the enlarged meeting of the Politburo, he was able to strongly request not to involve the armed forces in a campaign \\"four great freedoms\\", namely, writing, free expression of opinions and extensive discussion, and general criticism. Because they had supported the purging of many career Communist Party veterans during the early Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four opposed Zhou's efforts, and began to use the campaign to subtly criticize Zhou and his policies.Hsiung 638 The fourth and final phase of the campaign coincided with Zhou's illness and hospitalization. After the 1974 campaign \\"criticize Lin Biao and Confucius\\" reached its climax, and soon subsided. Beginning in the summer of 1975 the Gang of Four deployed a new campaign, introducing public debates on The Water Margin and the \\"war on empiricism\\" as a tool to criticize Zhou and their other enemies, notably Deng, which sidelined \\"criticism of Confucius.\\" Deng Xiaoping then took many of Zhou's responsibilities, acting as premier in Zhou's absence until Deng was again purged, in 1976. After Mao died, the Gang of Four also directed the campaign against Hua Guofeng, who was named Mao's successor. The campaign ended with Hua's arrest of the Gang of Four, in October 1976. In contrast to the Soviet Union, where militant atheism was taught several generations of citizens, China's Criticize Confucius a struggle lasted a total of not more than two years, and could not completely undermine the cultural core of Confucian civilization. When a few years Deng Xiaoping later returned to power, in search of ideological support for the planned reforms appealed to Confucian scholars, and met with understanding among the Chinese who retained the same faith in Confucian ideals. Theoretical focus The Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign was used as a political tool by the Gang of Four, but it did produce a genuine attempt to interpret historical Chinese society within the context of Mao's political theories. Maoist theorists attempted to use what they knew about the stone-age Dawenkou culture to produce evidence that a slave society had existed in Chinese history, just as Mao had described. These Maoist theorists used the recurrent patterns of peasant revolts, which have occurred throughout Chinese history, as evidence that the common people had consistently rejected both feudalism and the Confucian ideology that supported it. After their vitriolic denunciations of Confucianism, radical theorists attempted to interpret all of Chinese history as a long episode of conflict between the forces of Confucianism and Legalism, and attempted to identify themselves as modern Legalists.

It was originally a Gurkha regiment of the British Indian Army formed in 1815. They were present at a number of actions and wars including the Siege of Delhi in 1857 to the First and Second World Wars. After the Partition of India in 1947 the regiment was one of the six Gorkha regiments transferred to the Indian Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement signed between India, Nepal and Britain at the time of Indian independence. Prior to independence, the regiment was known as the 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles. In 1950 the regiment's title was changed to 3rd Gorkha Rifles. Since 1947 the regiment has participated in a number of conflicts including the 1947 and 1971 wars against Pakistan. Formation to 1885 The regiment was raised during the Gurkha War by Sir Robert Colquhoun on 24 April 1815 as the Kemaoon Battalion.About the 3rd Gorkha Rifles Accessed June 15, 2010. It did not consist entirely of Gurkhas but of men from Kumaon and Garhwal. The regiment adopted the tartan of the Clan Colquhoun. The regiment was primarily used to police the border with Nepal, doing so for many decades until the Indian Mutiny began in 1857. The battalion was actively involved in the efforts to quell it. During the Siege of Delhi‚Äîwhich lasted from March to September 1857‚Äîthe regiment, part of Colonel Colin Campbell's Third Column, took part in the storming of Kashmiri Gate and gained the Battle Honour \\"Delhi 1857\\". The mutiny was quelled by July 1858. The regiment, having been brought into the line of the Bengal Army, was briefly titled the 18th Bengal Native Infantry in 1861 before the regiment gained its present numeral designation when it became the 3rd Goorka (The Kumaon) Regiment. The regiment saw service in an expedition to Bhutan shortly after the name change. 3rd Goorkhas during the march to Kabul. In 1878 the Second Afghan War began and the regiment, as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Kandahar Field Force, took part in the march to seize Kandahar. The field force successfully captured the city on 8 January 1879, having experienced great hardship on the march there. The following year the Kandahar Force began the march towards the Afghan capital Kabul to join Major-General Roberts force in an attempt to consolidate their situation in the country. During the journey, near Ghaziri, the force were attacked by a large force of Afghan tribesmen at Ahmad Khel on 19 April 1880. The fighting that ensued was intense and the field force's situation was in the balance until the Afghan forces were successfully repulsed when the 3rd Goorkhas formed an infantry square. 1885‚Äì1914 The regiment took part in the Third Burmese War after it began in 1885 and operations concluded by the following year. In 1887 the 2nd Battalion was formed, consisting entirely of Garhwalis, but this was separated from the regiment in 1890 to form the 39th (The Garhwal) Regiment of Bengal Light Infantry. A new 2nd Battalion for the 3rd Goorkhas was raised that same year and in 1891 the Regiment was designated a rifle regiment, becoming the 3rd Gurkha (Rifle) Regiment. The 3rd Gurkhas took part in numerous campaigns in the volatile North-West Frontier, including the 1st Battalion's participation in the storming of the Dargai Heights on 20 October 1897 during the Tirah Campaign. The battalion was part of the Tirah Field Force intended to put down a large tribal revolt by the Afridi and Orakzais, orchestrated by Afghanistan. The 3rd Gurkhas took part in the advance into the Tirah Region, meeting resistance from tribal forces before moving on to help relieve Fort Lockheart and Fort Gulistan. After this was done the force marched on Dargai where they intended to take the heights above Dargai, controlled by tribal forces. View of Almora, with soldiers of 3rd Gurkha Rifles, 1895. The heights had originally been taken by the Tirah force on 18 October but they were ordered to withdraw, coming under attack as they did so and allowing the tribal force to return to the heights and strengthen their positions. The operation to retake the heights began with an artillery bombardment at 10:00am on 20 October. The regiment took part in the initial assault, positioned at the forefront of the attack with the 2nd Gurkha Rifles and the 1st Dorsets. They advanced methodically, moving up the slopes until they charged towards the enemy but sustained heavy casualties and became pinned down. The battle raged on for hours until, after the tribal positions were subject to an artillery bombardment, a final charge was made by the 1st Gordons, followed by the Gurkhas and 3rd Sikhs. The tribal defenders wilted in the face of the charge and the heights were taken later that day. In 1907 the title was changed to become the 3rd The Queen's Own Gurkha Rifles in honour of Alexandra of Denmark, queen consort of King Edward VII, and the following year the title became more specific when it became the 3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles. First World War In August 1914 the First World War began and the regiment's battalions actively participated on the Western Front and in the Middle East. In 1916, a clerical error gave the regiment a 4th Battalion when 4/3rd, instead of 3/4th, was written on the order for the raising of a battalion for the 4th Gurkha Rifles. The following year a 3rd Battalion for the 3rd Gurkhas was formed. =Western Front= The 2nd Battalion, as part of the 20th (Garhwal) Brigade of the 7th (Meerut) Division, was sent to France a few months after the declaration of war in 1914. The battalion's first large-scale action came at La Bass√©e that had commenced on 12 October as part of a period known as the \\"Race to the Sea\\". The battalion was involved in the defence of Festubert in November and Givenchy in December, during a bitter winter that the Gurkhas were no doubt unaccustomed to having spent the pre-war period on the sub-continent. The battalion remained on the Western Front until late 1915. At the Battle of Neuve Chapelle (10‚Äì13 March) the Garhwal Brigade advanced successfully during the initial offensive and the 2nd Battalion took part in fierce fighting during the battle. In May it was involved in the battles of Festubert and Aubers. In September the battalion took part in the Battle of Loos which saw the regiment awarded its first Victoria Cross. The VC action took place on 25 September when Rifleman Kulbir Thapa of the 2nd Battalion performed with distinction near the village of Fauquissart, becoming the first Gurkha recipient of the award.Parker 2005, pp. 111‚Äì112. The Battle of Loos was the battalion's last action on the Western Front and it left the 7th Division with the rest of the Garhwal Brigade for Egypt in December 1915 after the brigade became an independent unit. =Middle East= Battle of Mughar Ridge November 1917 Palestine: The Gurkha Rifles in front line trenches at the Battle of Mughar Ridge, Palestine, November 1917 After its arrival in Egypt the 2nd Battalion saw active service against the Ottoman Empire and later took part in the Palestine campaign, the second largest campaign by force totals during the First World War. It fought in the Autumn Offensive, seeing their first action during the Battles of Gaza. It was involved in many other actions during the campaign, including the capture of Jerusalem in December. On 19 September 1918, just a few months before the conclusion of the war, the Megiddo Offensive, began and the battalion was involved in the capture of Sharon. For its part in the campaign the 3rd Gurkhas gained seven Battle Honours and the Theatre Honour \\"Palestine 1917‚Äì18\\" after such honours were granted to units in the 1920s. On 10 April 1918 at El Kefr in Egypt, Karanbahadur Rana of the 2nd Battalion became the regiment's second VC recipient after distinguishing himself in an encounter with Ottoman forces, and was the last VC recipient of the regiment.Parker 2005, p. 393. Elsewhere the 1st Battalion, from 1917, took part in the Mesopotamian Campaign (now Iraq), gaining only a single Battle Honour in the process. It was achieved at the last battle of the campaign, at the Battle of Sharqat (28‚Äì30 October 1918). 1919‚Äì1939 The First World War concluded with the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 but this gave the regiment no respite. It took part in the Third Afghan War in 1919 and spent much of their inter-war years in the North West Frontier and Burma. The post-war reductions saw the regiment reduced to its pre-war establishment. The 3rd Battalion was disbanded in 1920 and the mistakenly raised 4th Battalion followed in 1922. Second World War The regiment was actively involved in Second World War and, as had happened during the First World War, the regiment was expanded to meet its commitments. The 3rd Battalion was re-raised in 1940, followed by the 4th Battalion in 1941. During the conflict, the regiment fought in a number of theatres, including North Africa, Italy and Burma. During the North African campaign, the 2nd Battalion fought at Tobruk, where they were brought in as reinforcements at the height of the battle and suffered misfortune almost immediately, when they were partially overrun by the Germans, losing almost two hundred men as prisoners of war, although many of these managed to escape later.Parker 2005, pp. 161‚Äì163. Post Independence India gained its independence in 1947 and the regiment was one of six Gurkha regiments (out of 10) to be allocated to the Indian Army as part of the Tripartite Agreement between Britain, India and Nepal.Parker 2005, p. 224 The regiment retained its title until 1950 when India was proclaimed a Republic and the regiment became the 3rd Gorkha Rifles. It remains in existence and consists of five battalions. The Regiment won the Battle Honour 'Pir Kanthi' in the Uri Sector in the war of 1948 and 'Shingo' in the Kargil Sector in war of 1971. 1/3 GR has the distinction of being the first battalion in the post-independence period to carry out amphibious operations during the 1971 Indo-Pak War. Colonel J.R. Chitnis, CO 1/3 GR, was honoured with the Ashoka Chakra posthumously‚ÄîIndia's highest peacetime medal for valour‚Äîin Nagaland in 1956. On 3 December 1997, a statue was unveiled in London in honour of the Gurkhas. A quote from Sir Ralph Turner, a former officer in the 3rd Gurkhas, was inscribed on the memorial: \\"Bravest of the brave, most generous of the generous, never had country more faithful friends than you.\\" Uniforms In its early years as the Kemaoon Battalion, the regiment wore green uniforms with white (after 1828 black) facings. As the 3rd Gurkhas from 1861, rifle green uniforms with black cuff facings were adopted to be worn with the round peakless Kilmarnock cap common to all Gurkha regiments.W. Y. Carman, pages 190 and 203 \\"Indian Army Uniforms Under the British From the 18th Century to 1947: Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\\", Morgsn-Grampian: London 1969 As was the practice with all Gurkha rifle regiments, black metal buttons and insignia were to remain features of the dress uniforms of the 3rd GR. Khaki drill was worn for active service and hot-weather dress from 1878 on. Shorts were adopted by the 3rd GR in 1900, at the same time as the wide brimmed \\"Kashmir\\" slouch hat came into general use. The latter had a green edged \\"pugri\\" (wide khaki band) as a regimental distinction.W. Y. Carman, pages 203-204 \\"Indian Army Uniforms Under the British From the 18th Century to 1947: Artillery, Engineers and Infantry\\", Morgsn-Grampian: London 1969 While the historic dark green ceased to be worn after World War I, except as part of officers' mess uniforms and a few other limited categories, the Kilmanock cap survived as a dress item until modern times.

It runs between Chungju city in North Chungcheong province and Mungyeong city in North Gyeongsang province. Haneuljae rises to about above sea level, between the peaks of Poam Mountain (963 m) and Juheul Mountain (1106 m). During the Silla and Goryeo periods of Korean history, it played a role of critical importance, as the principal pathway between southeastern and southwestern Korea, and in particular between the valleys of the Han and Nakdong rivers. In the Joseon period, this role was taken over by the pass of Mungyeong Saejae, and Haneuljae fell into disuse. Today only a minor country road traverses the pass. Seo (2001) contends that the pass played a particularly critical role in the diffusion of Buddhism into Silla from Goguryeo. The first monks bearing Buddhism to Silla came by land from the north, and Haneuljae would have been their most likely route. In addition, the area around Sangju, which would have been the first major city a traveller from the north would come to after crossing Haneuljae, early became a center of Buddhism, in contrast to much of the rest of Silla, which put up stiff resistance to the new faith. The Chungju side of Haneuljae is currently protected as part of Woraksan National Park. References Seo, Y.-i. (2001).

Tonda Puppet Hall, located in the city of Nagahama. Based in the northern part of the city of Nagahama on the shore of Lake Biwa, in Shiga Prefecture, northeast of Kyoto, the Tonda Puppets have made international performance tours to Australia, New Zealand, and four times to the United States. The Troupe performs regularly at their own theatre in Nagahama and on tour within Japan. The Tonda Puppet Troupe also instructs middle and high school students in bunraku puppetry and hosts training sessions for local citizens interested in pursuing the art of the traditional puppet theatre. The Tonda Troupe has also been active in training American college and university students in traditional Japanese puppetry in academic programs sponsored by such institutions as Berea College in Kentucky and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as well as the Japan Center for Michigan Universities, which is located in the nearby city of Hikone. In 2012 they also hosted a group of A-Level Theatre Studies students from Abingdon School and The School of St Helen and St Katharine, two independent schools in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. The \\"Scene at the Ferry Crossing,\\" in which the young woman Kiyohime, mocked by a boatman on the Hidaka River, is transformed into demon by her own jealous rage. From a performance of Hidakagawa Iriaizakura by the Tonda Puppet Troupe. History The Tonda Troupe traces it origins to the 1830s, when an itinerant puppet troupe that had been traveling from the north was snowbound in the village of Tonda, where they had intended to offer a performance. Unable to continue their journey home to Tokushima or to draw a paying audience because of the snow, the members of the troupe fell further and further into debt to the villagers for food and shelter. When the weather broke, the unfortunate troupe left their puppets behind as collateral for a loan for the boat fare necessary to travel to the southwestern end of Lake Biwa and beyond. When years passed and the itinerant troupe never returned to pay the debt and reclaim the puppets, the villagers finally formed their own puppet troupe, and by the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Tonda Puppet Troupe had itself become a semi-professional troupe that gave performances locally and on the road. Today, the Tonda Puppet Troupe still uses in performance many of the same puppet heads abandoned by the original snowbound troupe. Some of these puppet heads are over 200 years old, though the bodies and costumes, which wear more quickly, have been remade over the years. For generations, membership in the Tonda Troupe was restricted to men from the four families who had been traditionally associated with the theatre, but in the 1970s the troupe began to welcome both men and women from outside those families, and in 1993, the Tonda Puppets became the first traditional puppet troupe in Japan to admit a non-Japanese member. A theatre, the Tonda Puppet Hall (pictured above right), containing a full stage, as well as rehearsal and meeting spaces, was built for the Troupe in 1991 by the government of Shiga Prefecture. The Tonda Troupe is currently headed by Hidehiko Abe, who traces his ancestry back seven generations to one of the founding members of the troupe.

The show remained in production for its entire run on the air, differing from most syndicated game shows which usually wrapped in the early summer. The series was created by Ron Greenberg and was based largely on his 1969 production, The Who, What, or Where Game. Dick Clark presided over the show with Don Morrow announcing. The Challengers was a joint production of Ron Greenberg Productions and Dick Clark Productions, with Buena Vista Television (now Disney‚ÄìABC Domestic Television) as distributor. Gameplay Three contestants, one a returning champion, competed. =Challengers Sprint Round= The players were each spotted $200 to start the round, and Clark asked a series of toss-up questions for which players had to buzz in. Correct answers added $100 to a player's score, while incorrect answers deducted $100 and took the question out of play for the other two players. In early episodes, the rules were slightly different; players were not given any money at the outset, and if one player missed a question, either opponent could buzz in to answer it. The round ended after 60 seconds, and the player in the lead gained initial control for the first round. If two players were tied, one final Sprint question was asked, with a correct answer or an incorrect answer by an opponent gaining control. This round was briefly removed partway through the run (concurrent with the change to the daily \\"Ultimate Challenge\\" format, as described below) in favor of a single toss-up question, with the contestant who answered correctly scoring $100 and control of the Round 1 board. If someone buzzed in and did not answer correctly, he/she lost $100 and a new toss-up was given to the other two contestants. These rules did not last long, and by February 1991, the Challengers Sprint had been reinstated, concurrent with the removal of the \\"Ultimate Challenge\\" round, as described below. =Round 1= Six categories, each containing three questions, were displayed on a video wall. The contestant in the lead after the Challengers Sprint (or the one who answered the single toss-up correctly when the Sprint was not in use) chose one to begin the round. The contestants were then given clues to the subjects of the three questions, valued at $150, $200, and $250 in order of increasing difficulty (later reduced to $100, $150, and $200). Correct answers added the value of the question to the contestant's score, while incorrect answers subtracted the same value. Each contestant secretly chose one of the three questions using buttons on their podiums, and their choices affected the gameplay as follows: * Each contestant chose a different question. The three questions were asked in increasing order of value, with each contestant answering his/her own question. * Two contestants chose one question; the third contestant chose a different one. The two questions were asked in increasing order of value. The solo contestant had to answer his/her own question, while the two who chose the same question used their buzzers. If the first contestant of the two who chose the same question answered incorrectly, the other could either pass or try to answer. * All three contestants chose the same question. All three question values were immediately doubled, and the chosen question was asked as a toss-up open to all three contestants. The same toss-up rules as above applied. A contestant who answered correctly could either end the category or attempt either of the remaining two questions unopposed. Correctly answering this second question again gave the contestant the option to stop or try the third question. An incorrect answer on either the second or third question subtracted its doubled value from the contestant's score and ended the category. In each case, the category was eliminated from play and the last contestant to give a correct answer chose the next one. Play continued until all six categories were played or time ran out. =Round 2= Six new categories were introduced and play continued as described above, with all question values doubled ($300/$400/$500, later $200/$300/$400). As in Round One, play continued until all six categories were played or time ran out. Any players who finished the round with a zero or negative score were eliminated from the game. =Final Challenge= One final category was presented, with three question choices. The contestants were given 15 seconds to choose a question and place a wager on it, and each of the three questions had different payoff odds attached. The easiest question paid off at 1:1, or ‚Äúeven‚Äù, odds. The next most difficult question paid off at 2:1, or ‚Äúdouble‚Äù. The most difficult of the three paid off at 3:1, or ‚Äútriple‚Äù. The difference between the regular game and the Final Challenge was that only one player could answer a question; if two or more chose the same question, whoever made the highest wager was given the question and the other(s) were locked out. Answering a question correctly won the value of the wager multiplied by the odds, while the value of the wager only was deducted for an incorrect answer. The player in the lead after this round won the game and returned as champion the next day, although all contestants kept what they had earned. Each contestant had a Citibank Visa account (later, they could choose a MasterCard) opened in their name before the show started and any money they won was deposited into that account. Contestants could also choose to receive their winnings in cash rather than open the account.\\"The Challengers\\" episode aired September 17, 1990 Champions remained on the show until they were defeated. In the event that two contestants were eliminated from the game after the second round, the remaining player could opt out of the Final Challenge. If he/she chose not to, the round was played in a special manner. Like before, a category choice and wager would be made to start, and if the contestant answered correctly the value was added to his/her total. He/she was then given the option to stop again or play one of the other two questions, and if he/she was successful a second time the contestant was given the option to play the last renaming question. Giving an incorrect answer at any point ended the round and the contestant lost whatever he/she wagered on the question. =Ultimate Challenge= The Challengers featured a bonus round in which champions could win thousands of dollars. This round, the Ultimate Challenge, was played in two different formats during the show's run. Format #1 When the Ultimate Challenge was introduced, it was a game played for an accumulating cash jackpot. The champion had to qualify for the round by winning three consecutive matches, and would then play the round at the start of the next program. A choice of two categories was available, each containing three questions. The questions each focused on a different subject within the category and were arranged in order of increasing difficulty. After the champion chose a category, Clark would inform him/her of the subjects of the questions and would ask them one at a time. Following each question, the champion was given five seconds to think before responding. Giving an incorrect answer at any point ended the round, while correctly answering all three questions won the jackpot. Initially, the jackpot began at $50,000 and was to increase by $5,000 every time a champion played for it and did not win. The champion on the pilot episode, Doak Fairey, was allowed to play the Ultimate Challenge; this was the only instance of a champion not needing three victories to qualify. Fairey failed to win, resulting in the jackpot increasing to $55,000 for the show's official debut. He was defeated before he could win a third game and re-qualify, and no champion won three games during the first two weeks of episodes. Beginning with the week of September 17, 1990, the rules were modified. The jackpot would increase by $1,000 each day that the bonus went unclaimed. Once the original jackpot was hit, a second rule change took effect that saw its starting value reduced to $25,000. On September 24, 1990, champion Larry Caplan became the first Ultimate Challenge winner, taking down the original jackpot for $60,000. Under its original format, the Ultimate Challenge was won at least two more times. The first was on October 18, when a $42,000 jackpot was won, and again on November 20 when champion Stan Newman won $31,000 in what was the last playing of the Ultimate Challenge under its original format. When an Ultimate Challenge was played, the first round of that episode was shortened to end after three of its six categories had been played. Format #2 Beginning on November 21, 1990, the Ultimate Challenge was played as a daily bonus round with $10,000 cash at stake. Initially, as before, the champion was presented with a choice of categories before the round began. Later the choice was dropped and the champion was told the category at the outset of the round. Instead of needing to answer three questions correctly to win the Ultimate Challenge, the champion only had to answer one. However, the question could and often did contain multiple answers and all parts had to be answered correctly in order for the champion to win the $10,000. The Ultimate Challenge was eventually done away with, with the round scrapped sometime in either February or March 1991.Two episodes from around that time. One, from February 13, 1991, has the champion playing the round. An episode from April 1, 1991, does not. Tournaments =Tournament of Champions= For the first two months that The Challengers was on the air, contestants were not only competing to win money but were also trying to earn spots in the show's Tournament of Champions. The tournament was conducted the week of November 12, 1990, and its structure was similar to the one employed by Jeopardy! during its own tournaments. Nine players faced off on the first three days of the tournament, with the three winners playing a two-day cumulative score final. All three players kept whatever they earned in the two games, with the tournament winner earning an additional $25,000. After the match played on the November 9 episode, the field was set. Eight of the spots were filled by former champions. On the November 9 edition of the program, reigning champion Stan Newman won his second match and his total to that point made him one of the nine highest winners. In an unusual move, as many game shows that conduct tournaments like this do not feature sitting champions (including Jeopardy!), Newman interrupted his reign as champion to compete in the tournament. The final concluded on November 16, 1990 with Newman emerging victorious. He won over $40,000, including the $25,000 bonus for his triumph, which along with the aforementioned $31,000 Ultimate Challenge victory helped Newman set an all-time Challengers record of $112,480 in winnings over six matches (two tournament wins plus four wins in regular play). =Teachers Tournament= Nine teachers competed, using the same format as the Tournament of Champions; $10,000 was awarded to the winner. =Invitational Tournament= The Challengers invited nine more champions back for a second tournament of champions, which was held the week of March 18, 1991. The Challengers Invitational Tournament was conducted the same way that the Tournament of Champions was, with a two-day cumulative score final determining the champion and a cash bonus of $10,000 awarded to the winner on top of what they had earned in the two-day final. Lorin Burte won the Tournament by recording a total of $34,600 in the final, and with the $10,000 bonus added to that and the $46,075 won during his reign as champion, he finished with over $92,000 in cash. Questions Many questions were related to current events, an aspect that the producers saw as a selling point. Episodes were taped shortly before their airdate, which was prominently displayed in the opening and on a screen behind Clark; generally, a week of episodes were taped on the Friday of the previous week, which allowed such categories as \\"This Week On TV\\" and \\"Today At The Movies\\" to be used frequently. Most of the current event questions and answers were taken from, or verified by, Newsweek; this was announced on-air at the midpoint of each episode. The series was also unique in its payout structure: contestants received their winnings on a Citibank MasterCard or Visa credit card, although Dick referenced in some episodes that contestants had the option of converting the balance to cash.

He became known for his extravagant lifestyle, but in later years he reentered the minds of the Danish public as the manager of FC Zulu. Biography Strudal was born in Glostrup. He got his national breakthrough while playing for N√¶stved IF in the Danish 1st Division championship. He made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1988, and was named 1988 Revelation of the Year as N√¶stved finished runners-up in the 1st Division. He moved abroad to play professionally for German team Borussia Dortmund in the winter 1988. He played half a season at Dortmund, but had a controversy with manager Horst K√∂ppel. He moved on to play for Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich in Switzerland in the summer 1989, and won three trophies in his two years at the club. When the Grasshoppers squad faced 20% wage cuts, Strudal decided to leave the club in July 1991. In September 1991, he returned to Denmark to play for Vejle Boldklub in a transfer deal worth more than DKK 4 million. It was later to be known that his contract with Vejle had a clause which secured Vejle approximately DKK 4 million if he ever was to be sold to a club abroad. His stay at Vejle was short, as he suffered injuries and the club was relegated. He underwent a series of loan deals to other Danish teams; first to former club N√¶stved IF in the fall 1992, then to F.C. Copenhagen in February 1993, and finally to BK Frem in April 1993. When his Vejle contract ran out in the summer 1993, he moved on to league rivals Br√∏ndby IF on a free transfer in July 1993. Strudal helped Br√∏ndby win the 1994 Danish Cup and he was a part of the Denmark national team which won the 1995 King Fahd Cup. He stayed two years at Br√∏ndby, before he left the club in July 1995. Despite his credentials, the Vejle clause kept him from moving to a foreign club. He joined N√¶stved IF for a second time, where he suffered a knee injury which kept him out for five months. He tried to move abroad in the summer 1996, but a four-year contract with Greek club Skoda Xanthi was terminated without pay when Strudal was injured in a pre-season game. He underwent recovery, and made a short comeback to football on an amateur basis at Danish a local club in Hagested in August 1997. After his active career he has worked mostly as a coach of youth teams and forwards.

Early life He was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on 15 July 1921, the only son of George E. Merrifield and Lorene n√©e Lucas. In 1923 the family moved to California where he attended nine grade schools and two high schools before graduating from Montebello High School in 1939. It was there that he developed an interest both in chemistry and in astronomy. After two years at Pasadena Junior College he transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). After graduation in chemistry he worked for a year at the Philip R. Park Research Foundation taking care of an animal colony and assisting with growth experiments on synthetic amino acid diets. One of these was the experiment by Geiger that first demonstrated that the essential amino acids must be present simultaneously for growth to occur. He returned to graduate school at the UCLA chemistry department with professor of biochemistry M.S. Dunn to develop microbiological methods for the quantitation of the pyrimidines. The day after graduating on 19 June 1949, he married Elizabeth Furlong and the next day left for New York City and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Career At the institute, later Rockefeller University, he worked as an Assistant for Dr. D.W. Woolley on a dinucleotide growth factor he discovered in graduate school and on peptide growth factors that Woolley had discovered earlier. These studies led to the need for peptide synthesis and, eventually, to the idea for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) in 1959. In 1963, he was sole author of a classic paper in the Journal of the American Chemical Society in which he reported a method he called \\"solid phase peptide synthesis\\". This article is the fifth most cited paper in the journal's history. In the mid-60s Dr. Merrifield's laboratory first synthesized bradykinin, angiotensin, desamino-oxytocin and insulin. In 1969, he and his colleague Bernd Gutte announced the first synthesis of the enzyme ribonuclease A. This work proved the chemical nature of enzymes. Dr. Merrifield's method greatly stimulated progress in biochemistry, pharmacology and medicine, making possible the systematic exploration of the structural basis of the activities of enzymes, hormones and antibodies. The development and applications of the technique continued to occupy his laboratory, where he remained active at the bench until recently. In 1993, he published his autobiography, \\"Life during a Golden Age of Peptide Chemistry.\\" He received the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Award for outstanding contributions to Biomolecular Technologies in 1998. The achievement of synthesizing ribonuclease A (with Bernd Gutte) was all the more significant in that it demonstrated that the linear sequence of amino acids joined in peptide bonds determined directly the tertiary structure of a peptide or protein. I.e. that information coded in one dimension can directly determine the three-dimensional structure of a molecule. SPPS has been expanded to include solid phase synthesis of nucleotides and saccharides. Personal life After raising their 6 children, James, Nancy, Betsy, Cathy, Laurie and Sally, his wife Elizabeth (Libby), a biologist by training, joined the Merrifield laboratory at Rockefeller University where she worked for over 23 years. After a long illness R. Bruce Merrifield died on May 14, 2006 at the age of 84 in his home in Cresskill, New Jersey.Petkewich, Rachel. \\"Nobel Laureate R.

The club was founded in 1910 and plays in Ligue 2. The club president is Christian Leca, and the first-team is coached by manager Olivier Pantaloni, following the sacking of Christian Bracconi in October 2014. Ajaccio play their home matches at the Stade Fran√ßois Coty and are rivals with fellow Corsican club Bastia, with whom they contest the Corsica derby (Derby Corse).  Historical information  Depending on sources, it is agreed that Ajaccio began playing in 1909‚Äì10. Their adopted colors are red and white stripes. Though they used to play in what was previously utilised as a sand dump, they decided to move to another, cleaner, safer stadium upon the insistence of Jean Lluis, father-in-law of club president Louis Baretti. The new stadium that was chosen held 5,000 spectators and was in use until 1969. AC Ajaccio were elected Corsican champions on eight occasions, in 1920, 1921, 1934, 1939, 1948, 1950, 1955 and 1964, and are one of three big \\"island\\" teams, along with Gaz√©lec Ajaccio and Bastia, the competition between the three being kept no secret. Spectators during the 1946 Corsican Cup final, held between A.C.A. and Sporting Bastia were handed umbrellas to shield themselves from the violence. Upon refusal of a penalty which would have been awarded to ACA, violence erupted between the fans, who used umbrellas both to cause and shield themselves from violence. This final was abandoned and replayed much later. A.C.A. became a professional team in 1965 thanks to the ambitious efforts of the club's leaders. They initially adopted the symbol of the polar bear, but this has since been dropped in favour of a more stylised logo that uses a part of the Corsican flag. In 1967, the team became the first Corsican club to play in France's top division. They were most recently in Ligue 1 in the 2013‚Äì14 season, when they were relegated after finishing in last place, following a spell of three seasons in the top flight; the drop was confirmed with defeat at neighbours Bastia. In November 2014, Olivier Pantaloni returned for a third spell as manager. His team came third in 2017‚Äì18, qualifying for the play-offs, where they beat Le Havre in a semi- final marred by violence on and off the pitch, before losing the final to Toulouse. The club were denied promotion in 2019‚Äì20 when the season was curtailed with ten games remaining due to the coronavirus pandemic; Ajaccio were one point off the top two, who were the only ones to go up as the play- offs could not contested.

He is often called William Bourne of Gravesend. In 1574, he produced a popular version of the Mart√≠n Cort√©s de Albacar's Arte de Navegar, entitled A Regiment for the Sea. Bourne was critical of some aspects of the original and produced a manual of more practical use to the seaman. He described how to make observations of the sun and stars, using a cross-staff, and how to plot coastal features from the ship by taking bearings using triangulation.G. L'E. Turner, ‚ÄòBourne, William (c.1535‚Äì1582)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Life in Gravesend Before publishing his submarine design, William Bourne was a jurat in Gravesend, England. His name first appears in the first charter of incorporation of Gravesend from June 5, 1562. His name appears once again as a jurat in the second charter of Gravesend, June 5, 1568. During the time of the second charter, the only records of regulations for trading in Gravesend are written in Bourne's handwriting. This would imply that he held an office such as clerk of the market. He also worked as an innkeeper during this time, one of fourteen in the town of Gravesend. Submarine Design Submarine by William Bourne, in Inventions or devices, 1578. His design, detailed in his book Inventions or Devises published in 1578, was one of the first recorded plans for an underwater navigation vehicle. He designed an enclosed craft capable of submerging by decreasing the overall volume (rather than flooding chambers as in modern submarines), and being rowed underwater. Bourne described a ship with a wooden frame covered in waterproofed leather, but the description was a general principle rather than a detailed plan. However, the concept of an underwater rowing boat was eventually put into action by the Dutchman Cornelius Drebbel in 1620, and Nathaniel Symons demonstrated a 'sinking boat' in 1729 using the expanding and contracting volume of the boat to submerge. The submarine was the subject of a modern-day recreation on season 3 of \\"The Re-Inventors\\" TV show, episode \\"Bourne Submarine\\". The recreation had limited functionality before it sank when water pressure ruptured some membranes on a test descent.History Television (Canada), episode \\"Bourne Submarine\\", show \\"The Re-Inventors\\", season 3 Inventions or Devises The first page of \\"Inventions or Devises\\" by William Bourne, published in 1578 Inventions or Devises, published in 1578, is one of William Bourne's more important works. This book gives many guides and instructional tools for sailors, mostly concerning interactions with other ships. The 21st device listed is the earliest known description of a ship's log and line, which he attributes to Humprey Cole, an officer of the Tower Mint. The 75th device on the list is a description of a night signal or early semaphore system to be used between people on distant ships who had previously decided on a code consisting of a series of lights and fashion of standing. The 110th entry is what seems to be a type of telescope. The device was said to have been employed by mathematician and surveyor Leonard Digges and Bourne was asked to investigate it by Queen Elizabeth I's chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens (Bourne noted in his report that the device worked but had a very narrow field of view, making impractical in military applications).Patrick Moore, Eyes on the Universe: The Story of the Telescope, Springer Science & Business Media - 2012, page 9 This \\"backwards\\" reflecting telescope predates the earliest known working telescope by 30 years but its unwieldy nature seems to have kept it from being developed.Fred Watson, (2007), Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope, page 40.

The islands are the last you see when going by boat or ferry from Vaasa, Finland to Ume√•, Sweden. The archipelago is detached from Korsholm's main Replot- Bj√∂rk√∂ archipelago. They are uninhabited and there is no road access. However, they are an important bird sanctuary, frequented by birdwatchers and ornithologists. They are included in the newly established UNESCO world nature heritage site in the archipelago of Kvarken, a site exhibiting the effects of land rise due to post-glacial rebound. History =The name= The name Vals√∂rarna is of Swedish origin. It is believed that the name was derived from the stone-clad shores and the moraine which resembles a whale. The Finnish name Valassaaret is believed to have been derived from the Swedish word. =An old route between Finland and Sweden= The Vals√∂rarna is the shortest route to the Swedish island Holms√∂ only away. During winter, the waters of Kvarken are completely iced and it was possible to walk over to the neighbouring country that way. Today, this is not possible because of active ferry traffic and lanes that are kept open by icebreakers for commercial shipping. This fact was used during the Finnish War by Russian general Barclay de Tolly who used this route in November 1809 when marching over to Ume√•. The march to Sweden with about 3700 soldiers was successful but failed on the return trip. The severe cold of the spring and the lack of food took their toll on the men and it is estimated that 400 died from the cold alone. The remains of these soldiers were still present around Vals√∂rarna in the 1900s. In memory of the fallen men, there is now a memorial mound of stones raised on √Ñbbsk√§r. A saying tells the tale that the inhabitants of Vals√∂rarna grew tired upon always finding skeletons everywhere around the islands and collected them all in one place, which today is the mound of stones. =The lighthouse is built= Vals√∂rarna lighthouse There was a sailmark made out of a tree on the island in the 1850s, but that became inefficient for use in the dangerous waters of Kvarken as traffic increased. The long thought-of lighthouse became reality after five boats ran aground on the same night in 1879. The lighthouse was designed by Henry Lepaute who worked for Gustave Eiffels engineering company and built by the same company in France that manufactured the components for the Eiffel Tower. The lighthouse was initially intended to be placed on √Ñbbsk√§r. However, after digging and ground analysis, it was concluded that √Ñbbsk√§r had no suitable ground for the lighthouse and it was decided that it should be moved to Storsk√§r. The hole that was dug on √Ñbbsk√§r is still there today with a sea guard station as neighbour. For the move over to Storsk√§r, a bridge of stone was built between it and √Ñbbsk√§r. The road also built in connection to the bridge got the name K√§rleksstigen (\\" the love path\\"). The lighthouse was securely fastened on the mountain on Storsk√§r in 1886, and still stands there today, fire-red, high and with 175 steps inside. The lighthouse amazed and even scared people with its fire-red color fuelling rumors. The best known rumor was that if you touched the lighthouse, you got seriously burned from it. This rumor was so widespread that it lived long until the 1950s. In 1963 the lighthouse was first automated and later, in the 1980s, electrified. The lens system was removed in conjunction with the electrification and is now on display in Vaasa Seamuseum. The lighthouse was closed from the public in 2013. It was found that it was impossible to repair or reconstruct the lighthouse to fulfill modern safety and accessibility standards without substantially modifying the architecture.http://yle.fi/uutiset/yleisolle_lopullinen_porttikielto_eiffel- tornin_suunnittelijan_majakkaan_merenkurkussa/8940351 References Category:Finnish islands in the Baltic Category:Landforms of Ostrobothnia (region) ","title":"Vals√∂rarna"},{"id":"1256313","text":"Wakefield Baptist Church Wakefield is a village in the town of South Kingstown, Rhode Island, United States, and the commercial center of South Kingstown. Together with the village of Peace Dale, it is treated by the U.S. Census as a component of the census-designated place identified as Wakefield- Peacedale, Rhode Island. West Kingston, another South Kingstown village, was the traditional county seat of Washington County. Since 1991, the Washington County Courthouse has been in Wakefield. The Sheriff's Office which handles corrections is also in Wakefield. The Wakefield village center along Main Street (old Boston Post Road) between Belmont Avenue and Columbia Street was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 as Wakefield Historic District, with a boundary increase in 2019. The district is significant for being an early commercial and industrial center. The district includes 53 properties over an area of . History Wakefield was a focus for settlement due to its location on the Saugatucket River and the old Post Road, which was laid out early in the 18th century. Settlement began in the early 18th century with establishment of a small mill on the Saugatucket River. A tavern and stagecoach stop were established in 1745 and a snuff mill was built around 1765. The textile industry began to become an important source of economic activity in 1807 when a carding mill was established on the Saugatucket River. By 1822, the village had about 60 residents and consisted of nine houses, a store, the carding mill, a grist mill, a saw mill, and a blacksmith shop. A Baptist church was built in 1830 and an Episcopal church followed in 1840.Historic and Architectural Resources of South Kingstown, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report, Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, 1984 The local textile mill continued to operate and expand through the 19th century, but in the mid-century, as nearby Peace Dale grew as a manufacturing center and factories were established in other water power sites in the area, Wakefield became the commercial center of South Kingstown. It underwent considerable growth in the 1840s, including the development of some major retail stores. A Roman Catholic priest was assigned to Wakefield in 1852 and the first Catholic church was built two years later. Kenyon's Department Store was founded in 1856. A carriage manufacturing operation was established in 1874, and in 1876 the Narragansett Pier Railroad started operation, with a station in Wakefield. It is now a bike trail called the William C. O'Neill Bike Path. In 1877, the South Kingstown Town Hall was built in the village. A bank and several other major businesses arrived in the 1880s. By 1895, Wakefield had a population of 1,543, and had begun to coalesce with the villages of Peace Dale and Rocky Brook, forming a roughly contiguous settlement with a total population of 3,285. The Wakefield Mill underwent several ownership changes and expansions in the 20th century. In 1903, it was sold to the Wakefield Woolen Company, which installed new looms and carding equipment for producing high-grade woolen fabrics. It sold again in 1922 and four more times between World War II and 1984. Beginning in the 1950s, parts of the mill complex began to be converted to other uses, but as of 1984, much of the complex was still used for textile manufacturing. Wakefield's first hospital was started in a house in 1919, and a new South County Hospital building was built in 1925 on a tract that formerly had been the town farm. Beginning in the late 1950s, commercial activity in Wakefield migrated away from the central business district to new commercial areas on the periphery of the community. As of 1984, the village was considered the largest shopping area in South County. Economy Much of Wakefield's economy is driven by seasonal tourism, as the main central business district of South Kingstown runs from the Saugutucket River up to Old Tower Hill. Arts and culture Buildings in Wakefield listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Rhode Island include Wakefield Baptist Church, Nathaniel C. Armstrong House, John H. Armstrong House, Hera Gallery, and Bell Block. Education Wakefield is part of the South Kingstown School District.

History The town was founded by Frederick Moth after he was made governor of St. Croix in 1733. Departing from St. Thomas, Capt. Moth's party had cleared a space for Fort Christiansw√¶rn by 5 September. In a ceremony next to this fort on 8 Jan. 1734, the French formally handed over the island to the Danes in the form of the Danish West India and Guinea Company. The island was to be allotted 300 plantations, 215 for sugar and the remainder for cotton. The plantations surveyed were 3000 feet by 2000 feet. In addition, the company established a sugar refinery and distillery. The fort was completed by 1740. The 1742 census listed 120 sugar plantations, 122 cotton plantations, and 1906 slaves compared to about 300 Englishmen and 60 Danes. By 1743, the island had a hospital and in 1745, the number of slaves had increased to 2878. By 1754, the town included 83 \\"white inhabitants\\", \\"each of whom owned from a single slave to sixty-six of them,\\" according to Westergaard. Total slaves on the island had increased to 7566. It is a former capital of the Danish West Indies and home to the Christiansted National Historic Site. Christiansted has preserved the 18th-century Danish-style buildings constructed by African slaves. Solid stone buildings in pastel colors with bright red tile roofs line the cobblestone sidewalks, adding a touch of 18th-century European architectural style. Because the town was constructed by African slaves, there are many African influences in Christiansted's design as well, making it one of the few \\"African-Danish\\" towns in the world. The town's symmetry, with streets running at right angles to the waterfront, makes it popular for walking tours. The commercial area centers on King and Company streets, adjacent to the Christiansted National Historic Site. The residential area, including portions that were originally settlements for free blacks, extends inland and uphill from the commercial area. The botanist Julius von Rohr started a botanic garden in the 18th century and produced a number of landscapes of the island. The town has small hotels and many restaurants. Several scuba shops operate in the town, as the wharf has easy access to many diving attractions on the north side of the island. A small point of interest is Protestant Cay, a cay near Christiansted. Economy With a small population, the economy of Christiansted is not extremely vast. Christiansted as of 2004, had a population of about 3,000. The 2000 census population of the town was 2,637; that of the larger sub-district was 2,865.

History Marbach am Neckar was founded by the Franks in the 8th century AD between the Duchies of Swabia and Franconia and the Prince- Bishoprics of Speyer and Constance. Marbach received its town rights in 1009 from Walter Marktrecht, Bishop of Speyer. Around the mid-13th century, those rights were reaffirmed by the Dukes of Teck. In 1302, the Dukes of Teck sold Marbach to the County of W√ºrttemberg, who made the city the seat of its own administrative district later in the 14th century and then an Oberamt, , in 1758. That Oberamt was dramatically enlarged on 18 March 1806, but then dissolved entirely in 1938. Marbach was subsequently assigned to a new district, Landkreis Ludwigsburg. On 1 July 1972, Marbach incorporated the town of Rielingshausen. Geography The city (Stadt) of Marbach am Neckar covers of the district of Ludwigsburg in a total of four separate exclaves. Marbach is, according to government urban planning, part of the Stuttgart Metropolitan Region. Marbach's municipal areas are physically located in the Neckar, with the exception of its easternmost exclave, which lies in the Swabian-Franconian Forest. The lowest elevation above sea level in the municipal area, Normalnull (NN), is found where the Neckar flows out of Marbach and into Benningen am Neckar. The highest elevation, , is found in the east, at the top of the B√ºlzberg. Politics Marbach has two boroughs (Ortsteile) ‚Äì Marbach am Neckar and Rielingshausen ‚Äì and three villages: Hinterbirkenhof, H√∂rnle, Siegelhausen. Also in Marbach's municipal area are the minor administrative units of Dampfkraftwerk, Eichgraben, and H√§ldenm√ºhle, and the abandoned villages of Hegnachsiedel, Kaisersberg, and Sigebotesbuch. =Sister cities= Marbach am Neckar is twinned with: * L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise, France, since 1987 * Washington, Missouri, United States, since 1990 * Tongling, Anhui, People's Republic of China, since 2005 =Coat of arms= right Marbach am Neckar's coat of arms displays its field, gold in color, as divided party per pale into halves. The left half has three black , taken from the arms of W√ºrttemberg. The right half has a crenelated, white tower wrapped with green vines growing two clusters of blue grapes. The placement of W√ºrttemberg's arms is derived from town seals in since W√ºrttemberg's purchase of the city in 1302, when their arms replaced those of the Dukes of Teck. The tower first appeared around 1547 as a reference to local viticulture. The current coat of arms was devised in 1938 from a 1593 town seal. Marbach has had a municipal flag since 1871.

Marthanda Varma defeated the Dutch (VOC) forces at the Battle of Colachel in 1741. He then adopted a European mode of discipline for his army and expanded his kingdom northward (to what became the modern state of Travancore). He built a sizeable standing army of about 50,000 men, as part of designing an \\"elaborate and well-organised\\" war machine, with the role of the Nair nobility (on which kings of Kerala had earlier been dependent for battles), and fortified the northern boundary of his kingdom (Travancore Lines). His alliance in 1757 with the ruler of Kochi (Cochin), against the northern Kingdom of Calicut, enabled the kingdom of Kochi to survive. Travancore under Marthanda Varma made a deliberate attempt to consolidate its power by the use of Indian Ocean trade. It was the policy of Marthanda Varma to offer assistance to Syrian Christian traders (as a means of limiting European involvement in ocean trade). The principal merchandise was black pepper, but other goods also came to be defined as royal monopoly items (requiring a license for trade) between the 1740s and the 1780s.Subrahmanyam, S. (1988). Commerce and State Power in Eighteenth-Century India: Some Reflections. South Asia Research, 8(2), 97‚Äì110. Eventually, Travancore challenged and broke the Dutch blockade of the Kerala coast. Trivandrum became a prominent city in Kerala under Marthanda Varma. In January, 1750, Marthanda Varma decided to \\"donate\\" his kingdom to Sri Padmanabha (Vishnu) and thereafter rule as the deity's \\"vice-regent\\" (Sri Padmanabha Dasa). Marthanda Varma's policies were continued in large measure by his successor, Rama Varma (\\"Dharma Raja\\") (1758‚Äì98).  Early life  Marthanda Varma was born in 1706 to queen Karthika Thirunal, the Queen of Attingal, and Raghava Varma of Kilimanoor Palace. Queen Karthika Thirunal Uma Devi - an adoptee from the northern Kolathunadu ruling family - was the senior queen of Attingal at the time. His father Raghava Varma Koil Thampuran died of severe fever when he was one year old. At the time of Varma's birth, Trippappur Swaroopam (Thiruvithamkoor or Travancore) was a small chiefdom extending from Edava in the north to Aralvaimozhi in the south. The fundamental politico-economic structure of medieval Kerala was going through a crisis. The power of the king of Venad was very weak and he could not sustain his control over his territory. The old political structure of the medieval Kerala was going through a crisis in the beginning of the 18th century. * Decentralized state (complex feudal and political relations).Ganesh, K. N. (1990). The Process of State Formation in Travancore. Studies in History, 6(1), 15‚Äì33. Influence of the local land lords (the Ettuveetil Pillamar) and the barons (landlords known as Madampimar). The authority of the throne was also curbed by the Council of Eight and a Half (the Yogakkar), the managing committee of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. There was no standing army. * European monopoly in Indian Ocean spice trade. The constant Dutch blockade of the Malabar Coast. Trade with the Europeans was an important source for augmenting the financial reserves of the Kerala kingdoms. *Quarrels and open warfare among the various royal lineages (increased the dependence of the royals on their warriors and collectors of dues). Trade rivalries between the Dutch and English companies had a role in intensifying the conflict among the branches. An English East India Company factory was established at Vizhinjam in 1644. The Ajengo Fort was established in 1695. The ruler Rama Varma (1721/22 - 1729) entered into treaties with the English East India Company (1723) and the Madurai Nayaks with the aim of strengthening his position (in the fight against the nobles and other hostile elements in Tranvancore). The role played by Marthanda Varma in these moves are highlighted by P. Shungoonny Menon, the 19th-century Travancore court historian. The Dutch Company positioned themselves against the emerging Travancore by helping Quilon and Kayamkulam. The English Company became an ally of Travancore against the Dutch.  Rule of Marthanda Varma  Marthanda Varma ascended the throne when the crisis in Travancore had already deepened. King Rama Varma was forced to invite troops from Tamil Nadu to collect dues and impose order. Even the Padmanabha Swamy Temple affairs were heading towards a crisis due to lack of funds. The Thampi brothers, sons of Rama Varma, immediately revolted against Marthanda Varma (who was the legitimate successor on the basis of the Nair matrilineal system) with the assistance of a Tamil army. Marthanda Varma's reign was one of constant warfare, against opponents both inside and outside his territory. After reducing the power of the Ettuveetil Pillamar, the Nair aristocracy, and their associates, the Yogakkars, Marthanda Varma turned his attention to central Kerala. He realised that Dutch power in Kerala stemmed from their flourishing spice trade at the port of Kochi. He set out to conquer the major spice-producing areas supplying cargo to Kochi. After declaring a state monopoly on pepper in Travancore in 1743, between then and 1752, the king annexed Quilon, Kayamkulam, Thekkumkur, Vadakkumkur and Purakkad to Travancore (thereby delivering a serious blow to the commerce of the Dutch). * In 1731, the port of Kollam (Quilon) - which was ruled by a branch of the Venadu family to which Marthanda Varma also belonged - was defeated and its last chief was made to sign a treaty allowing the annexation of his chiefdom by Travancore after his death. The chief was brought to Trivandrum and lodged almost as a state prisoner in the Valikoikkal Palace. A contingent of the Travancore army under Dalavay Arumukham Pillai was stationed at Kollam. * Marthanda Varma next turned his attention towards the little chiefdom of Marta and seized it. The neighbouring chiefdom of Kayamkulam - sensing an imminent invasion by Travancore - soon allied itself with Kochi, Purakkad and Vadakkumkur. The Kayamkulam chief was also successful in rescuing the Kollam chief from his Trivandrum prison. The allies built new fortifications and strengthened their defences against the threat of Travancore. The Dutch East India Company also professed to support the war effort. * The subsequent invasion of Marta by the Kayamkulam chief signalled the outbreak of the war. The Travancore army seized Nedumangadu and Kottarakkara and prevented the joined forces of Elayadathu and Kayamkulam. Travancore Dalavay Ramayyan then lead an expeditionary force to capture the city of Kollam. But, he was forced to withdraw without accomplishing his mission. * Having equipped their forces with the help of the French and the English Companies, Travancore renewed a military operation against the chief of Kollam. In the campaigns that ensued, the ruler of Kayamkulam was killed (1734). But the defence of Kollam continued under the leadership of the brother of the deceased chief and Travancore forces were forced to fall back once again. * Travancore's next campaign was against Elayadathu Swaroopam (Kottarakara). When the chief of Kottarakara who was kept in solitary confinement in Trivandrum died in 1739, Marthanda Varma refused to recognise the claim of the senior female member to succession. The princess fled to Thekkumkur where the chief gave granted her asylum. At this juncture, the Dutch Governor of Ceylon Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff sensed an opportunity to involve further in the politics of Kerala. * In 1739, van Imhoff arrived in Kochi, took up the cause of the female ruler of Kottarakara and protested against the annexation of that chiefdom by Marthanda Varma in a meeting between the two. In 1741, the Dutch reinstated the female ruler of Kottarakara against the wishes of Marthanda Varma, who attacked the chiefdom and defeated the combined Kottarakkara - Dutch forces before finally fully annexing the chiefdom to Travancore while the female ruler fled to Kochi. =Battle of Colachel (1741)= The chapel at 193x193px Travancore then launched a series of raids on the Dutch forts in the area and captured them all. In retaliation, a Dutch artillery force landed at Colachel from Ceylon and conquered up to Kottar. The Dutch forces then advanced against Kalkulam, Travancore's capital. Marthanda Varma, who was then in the north of his state promptly marched his forces to the south and arrived at Kalkulam just in time to prevent its fall to the Dutch. In the following battle at Colachel (10 August 1741), the Travancore forces won a resounding victory over the Dutch. More than twenty Dutch were taken as prisoners of war from Colachel. Among them was Eustachius de Lannoy, who attracted the king's special notice. Eustachius de Lannoy, commonly known in Travancore as the 'Valiya Kappittan' (Senior Captain) was entrusted with the organisation and drilling of a special regiment, which he did to the \\"entire satisfaction of the king\\". De Lannoy was raised to the rank of general in Travancore army and proved of considerable service to Marthanda Varma in subsequent battles. = Treaty of Mavelikkara (1753) = * Following the expulsion of the Dutch, Marthanda Varma now turned his attention once again towards Kayamkulam (which continued to seek help from the Dutch Company). In 1742, Travancore forces attacked Kayamkulam possessions at Kollam and fought the Kayamkulam army led by Achuta Warrier and chiefs from Valiya Kakkanadu Madhom. Although Travancore was defeated in this battle, Marthanada Varma reinforced his army with cavalry brought in from Tirunelveli before mounting an attack on Kayamkulam, which led to the final defeat of the chiefdom. A treaty known as the Treaty of Mannar (1742) was signed, under which Kayamkulam became a tributary state of Travancore. * However, by 1746, the Kayamkulam chief once again showed signs of rebellion and when his \\"conspiracies\\" with the northern chiefdoms such as Kottayam, Changanassery, Kochi and Ambalapuzha came to the attention of Marthanda Varma, Kayamkulam was annexed by a final battle in which the chief fled to Kochi and a branch of the family settled near Charamood known as \\"Moothantedom\\". Travancore now extended from Kanyakumari to Kayamkulam in the north. * Following this, Ambalapuzha, Kottayam and Changanassery were also annexed to Travancore by 1753. The principality of Meenachil was also annexed. * In 1753, the tributary states of Kochi collectively known as Karappuram and Alangad were ceded to Travancore. In 1755, the ruler of Kozhikode was also defeated at a battle in Purakkad. He was supported by the armies of some other local chiefs. The ascent of Travancore seems to have been particularly rapid after about 1749. Marthanda Varma had declared a state monopoly on pepper in Travancore in 1743, thereby delivering a serious blow to the commerce of the Dutch. A treaty (the Treaty of Mavelikkara) was concluded between Marthanda Varma and the Dutch East India Company. It was signed at Mavelikkara on 15August 1753. Thereafter, the Dutch Company officials report that \\"considerable spice producing lands came under direct royal control, while those merchants participating in illegal trade in spices stood in danger of being executed\\". Administration * Use of maritime outlets: Marthanda Varma made a determined bid to consolidate his authority by the use of Indian Ocean spice trade. The control of ocean trade was crucial for the statecraft of 18th century India. Travancore challenged and eventually broke the Dutch blockade of the southern Malabar Coast. * Royal monopoly (the Kuttakam): a number of traded goods such as black pepper were defined as royal monopoly items. These items required a state license for trade in Travancore. * Dismantling of the old aristocracy - complete restructuring of the medieval political framework: Marthanda Varma reduced the power of the Nair aristocracy (especially the Ettuveettil Pillamar, and their associates, the Yogakkar of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple) in Travancore. Kings of Kerala had earlier been dependent militarily on these powerful community of nobles. * Patronage to Syrian Christians: To limit the European involvement in trade, Marthanda Varma extended his patronage to the ancient mercantile community in Kerala. The Syrian Christians soon enhanced their position as landholders and those who controlled the new monopoly. * Extensive bureaucratisation : a Dalava was appointed to head the military, fiscal and commercial administration. Below the Dalava was established an extensive hierarchy, from the Valia Sarvadhi Kariakkars to the Kariakkars, Manikars and Adhikaris. Upper positions of this new system was dominated by Brahmins effectively reduce the Nairs influences in the administration. The old Pandara Kariakkar and Swarupi Janam were replaced by a new administrative system. Divisions known as Adhikaram and Mandapattu Vatukkal were introduced. **Dalavas under Marthanda Varma ***Arumukham Pillai 1729‚Äì1736 ***Thanu Pillai 1736‚Äì1737 ***Ramayyan Dalavay 1737‚Äì1756 ***Marthanda Pillai 1756‚Äì1758 *Military machine: a substantial standing army, roughly estimated at around 50,000, was created. The soldiers were mainly ordinary Nairs who received tax concessions (the Irayili) for the period under service and a pension (the Irayili Aduthoon) on retirement. Marava Cavalry and Pathan Cavalry was also used by Marthanda Varma. Assistance from some defected Dutch officers were also received (after the victory at Colachel). With the beginning of the conflict against Quilon and Kayamkulam (who were being supplied arms by the Dutch), supply of English arms and ammunition also began to increase. Artillery batteries were positioned facing the Arabian Sea from Purakkad to Cape Comorin. Construction of intricate fortifications in Travancore, including the Travancore Lines. *Expansion of agricultural production: development of water harvesting and irrigation projects, and the so-called \\"Kulikkanam\\" tenure. The Kulikkanam was applicable to \\"newly planted trees and freshly sown lands\\", where a tax reductions (the Naduvukkur and Vettalivu) were granted. The tenure was found along with the Otti tenure, similar to the Kanam tenure (found elsewhere in Kerala). A number of commercial crops were cultivated in lands under this tenure. The Kulikkanam cultivators usually went to the market to sell their goods for cash (and hence the Kulikkanam dues were collected as cash). *The basis for the changes in the political and economic relations was provided by the transformation of the old agrarian relations. Extensive land survey and settlement. Culture and religion Marthanda Varma started normalising the relationship between the royal family (the ruler) and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple (the administrative body of the temple) as soon as he came to the throne. He undertook the Prayaschittam retribution that was long overdue from the earlier Venadu kings. He reorganized the collection of dues from the temple lands. After the land survey of 1739-40, the allotment of expenses for the temple was fixed. Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram was re-created as the gigantic structure of today and new state ceremonies such as Murajapam, Bhadra Deepam, and others were introduced by Marthanda Varma. The main Vishnu idol of the shrine, which was mostly destroyed in a fire during his predecessor Rama Varma's time, was also re- constructed. He also created Ottakkal Mandapam as well as the Sheevelippura. Out of the seven floors of the temple gopura, five were finished during his reign. Thiruvananthapuram became a prominent city in Kerala under Marthanda Varma. As a result of the annexation of neighboring chiefdoms, the artists and scholars from these places migrated to Trivandrum, turning it into a cultural center. Marthanda Varma gave patronage to different temple art forms including Koothu, Padhakam, Kathakali, Thullal, and Koodiyattam. Noted artists such as Ramapurathu Warrier and Kunchan Nambiar amongst others served as his court poets. Marthanda Varma was a Samantan Nair. Desiring the dignity of Kshatriya , he performed a set of elaborate and expensive Mahadaanam rituals. They included the Hiranyagarbha, in which has was reborn from a golden cow. While this secured him the status of a Kshatriya, the effect was temporary, he and his descendants had to perform these rituals at regular intervals. Thrippadidanam In 1749‚Äì50, Marthanda Varma decided to \\"donate\\" his realm to Sri Padmanabha (Vishnu) and thereafter rule as the deity's \\"vice-regent\\" (Sri Padmanabha Dasa). = Purpose of Thrippadidanam = * Separation of the newly formed \\"unitary kingship\\" (and political power) from the disputes and frictions in the civil society. * Formalisation of the new power structure in Travancore. * To integrate the existing social divisions in Kerala under the emerging power structure. Death Ramayyan Dalava, prime minister and a close friend of Marthanda Varma, died in 1756. Ramayyan's death caused terrible grief to Marthada Varma, and he died two years later in 1758. He was succeeded by his nephew Rama Varma (\\"Dharma Raja\\"). Marthanda Varma's policies were continued in large measure by Dharma Raja (1758‚Äì98). He also went on to successfully defend Travancore against the aggression of the Kingdom of Mysore. Marthanda Varma's legacy involved a major restructuring of the medieval political and economic relations of southern Kerala.

Together with the village of Wakefield, it is treated by the U.S. Census as a component of the census-designated place identified as Wakefield-Peacedale, Rhode Island. The Peace Dale Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1987. The historic district is roughly bounded by Kersey Rd., Oakwoods Dr., Kingstown Rd., School, Church and Railroad Sts., and contains the historic core of the village. History Peace Dale was established as an official town in 1793 by South Kingstown industrialist Rowland Hazard who named the village in honor of his wife, Mary Peace Hazard. Around 1804, Hazard reputedly pioneered the use of carding machines to process wool in Rhode Island. In 1814, Hazard was also one of the first American manufacturers to employ narrow-width power looms, and also was the first woolen manufacturer to combine all his manufacturing processes under one roof, from wool carding through spinning, weaving, and dyeing. In 1819 Rowland Hazard's sons Isaac P. Hazard and Rowland G. Hazard assumed management responsibility for the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company.Rowland Gibson Hazard, Rhode Island Manufacturer, Politician, and Philosopher, University of Rhode Island Library, Special Collections and University Archives, 2007Peace Dale Manufacturing Company Records, Rhode Island Historical Society, Manuscripts Division A third brother, Joseph P. Hazard, joined them as a partner in 1828, and the business took the name \\"R.G. Hazard & Co.\\" Around 1820 the senior Rowland Hazard renamed the nearby industrial village to Wakefield after the town and family of the same name in England, who were friends of his. Prior to this, the village had been called McCoon's Mill for the snuff mill that by the 1820s had been converted to manufacturing woolen textiles. After an 1845 fire destroyed one of the mill buildings, the brothers built new facilities, including expanded hydropower systems and a fireproof stone factory. In 1848 the partnership incorporated, becoming the Peace Dale Manufacturing Company, with Isaac P. Hazard as president and Rowland G. Hazard as secretary/treasurer.Rowland G. and Caroline (Newbold) Hazard Papers, Rhode Island Historical Society, Manuscripts Division In 1849 the business started a transition into making woolen shawls and other high-quality woolens instead of cheaper fabrics.Peace Dale History and Historic Sites, Peace Dale Neighborhood Revitalization, Inc., 2007 Later in the 19th century, the sons of Rowland G. Hazard, John N. and Rowland Hazard II (1829-1898), assumed responsibility for operating the Peace Dale Mills. In 1856 Rowland Hazard II, an amateur architect, designed several new buildings in Peace Dale, including a new stone weaving mill and a stone building located across from the mills that housed offices, a store, the village post office, and a public hall. Over the next several decades he influenced the construction and design of numerous additional buildings, accounting for more than half of the built environment of modern Peace Dale. Rowland Hazard II also was an initial investor in the Solvay Process Company, with works at Solvay, New York, and served as the company's first president. Peace Dale's mills operated for woolen manufacturing until 1948, when the manufacturing machinery was removed.Historic and Architectural Resources of South Kingstown, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report, Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, 1984 =Contributing properties= Buildings in Peace Dale that are identified as contributing properties in the historic district include: * Peace Dale Congregational Church, a Gothic Revival church built in 1870-72 on Columbia St. * Peace Dale Manufacturing Company Barn, a secondary structure built in 1866, on Green St. * Peace Dale Grammar School, a Colonial Revival school built in 1923, on Kersey Rd. * Former Peace Dale Grammar School, built in 1902 at 8 Kersey Rd., later used for storage. * Peace Dale Manufacturing Co.

Guo Xi's style name was Chunfu (Ê∑≥Â§´Ôºâ was a Chinese landscape painter from Henan ProvinceCi hai: Page 452 who lived during the Northern Song dynasty. One text entitled \\"The Lofty Message of Forest and Streams\\" (Linquan Gaozhi ÊûóÊ≥âÈ´òËá¥) is attributed to him. The work covers a variety of themes centered on the appropriate way of painting a landscape. He was a court professional, a literatus, well-educated painter who developed an incredibly detailed system of idiomatic brushstrokes which became important for later painters. One of his most famous works is Early Spring, dated 1072. The work demonstrates his innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives which he called \\"the angle of totality.\\" This type of visual representation is also called \\"Floating Perspective\\", a technique which displaces the static eye of the viewer and highlights the differences between Chinese and Western modes of spatial representation. The following is an excerpt from his treatise, \\"mountains and waters\\": > The clouds and the vapours of real landscapes are not the same at the four > seasons. In spring they are light and diffused, in summer rich and dense, in > autumn scattered and thin, in winter dark and solitary.

His son later described how Guo Xi approached his work: \\"On days when he was going to paint, he would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left.

It is a grid-planned city, designed by surveyor Jens Beckfor, originally to 14x14 blocks but built 7x7 to enhance the island commerce in the 1700s. Frederiksted has fewer than 1,000 people in the town proper, but nearly 10,000 in the greater western side of the island. Christiansted (mid-island on the north) is about 30 years older but commerce was limited by its natural, shallow protective reef. Frederiksted was built in the leeward side of the island (shadow of the wind) for calm seas and a naturally deep port. It is home to Fort Frederik, constructed to protect the town from pirate raids and attacks from rival imperialist nations and named after Frederick V of Denmark, who purchased the Danish West Indies in 1754. Frederiksted is often referred to as \\"Freedom City\\" by locals. This nickname has to do with the fact that the town was the site of the emancipation of slaves in the then-Danish West Indies. On July 3, 1848, freed slave and skilled craftsman Moses Gottlieb, who also was known as \\"General Buddhoe,\\" led the uprising, organized slaves on St. Croix's West End plantations, and marched on the town of Frederiksted. The emancipation of slaves was proclaimed on July 3, 1848, at Fort Frederik on the waterfront at the northern edge of Frederiksted by Governor-General Peter von Scholten. Frederiksted is home to one of two deep water ports on St. Croix and is the sole port for cruise ships visiting the island. Passengers disembark at the Frederiksted Pier, where they may explore the town, enjoy the beaches, rent a car, or catch a waiting taxi that will take them to other points of interest across St. Croix. The other deep water port is located at the South Port which includes the tank farm of the former Hovensa oil refinery as well as Renaissance Industrial Park. The territory's legislature is also located in Frederiksted. There are also several government offices that occupy historic buildings. Briefly in the early 2000s, Frederiksted was a port for Seaborne Airlines seaplanes, which are based in the town of Christiansted. Seaplane service ended after less than one year of service due to a tropical storm damaging the port facility. History Fort Frederik The town was destroyed by a labor revolt (known as \\"The Fireburn\\" because arson was utilized as a means of revolt) in October 1878, which was led by four Crucian female laborers. Frederiksted was later restored during the Victorian era, as reflected in the town's architecture. Modern Frederiksted operates at a slower pace than Christiansted, except for carnival in January and whenever cruise ships dock in Frederiksted's deepwater port. In recent years successful redevelopment efforts have begun to restore and revitalize this National Historic Site. The 2000 census population of the town was 732, and that of the larger sub-district was 3,767. Image:Saint Croix carnival dancer.jpg  A costumed carnival dancer.

Coastal Systems was retained by the Public Finance Authority to develop concepts for a waterfront park, beach, cruise pier, and other site improvements. Teams of land planners, engineers, and landscape architects met with local interest groups to develop conceptual plans for the redevelopment of the area. Environmental regulatory surveys and permits were managed by the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Agency of the USVI. Phase I of the project was completed, which consisted of the reconstruction of the waterfront park while maintaining the historical facade representative of St. Croix's heritage. Natural stonework was used throughout the project site in accordance with the local architectural style, enhancing the authenticity of the arrival experience. Phase II of the project, contemplated for the future, will involve the reconstruction of the community waterfront north of the fort and include the recreation of breakwaters, the reconstruction of Paul E. Joseph Stadium, and the restoration of the beach, restroom facilities, retaining pond, utilities, parking areas, and soccer fields.  Volunteers, Community, and Art  Volunteer-ism is a big part of Frederiksted. Clean Sweep Frederiksted engages volunteers in community clean ups, mural and garden projects among opportunities. They also worked with the Artists Guild of St. Croix to install dozens of painted rum barrels as community trash bins. The Artists Guild of St. Croix has installed several murals, paintings, and sponsors scholarships. Delta Dorsch who was born in Frederiksted, wrote two books The Role of the Storyteller in the Preservation of Virgin Islands Culture (1999) and contributed to The Glory Days of Frederiksted (2004) about cultural aspects of the community.  Climate  Frederiksted has a tropical climate with warm weather year-round. Water temperatures of 78-79'F in winter and ~85'F in September. The waters are typically very calm as Frederiksted is in the leeward side (shadow of the island's wind) with ~12 inch tide. The sunrise varies from 5:30 a.m. in summer and 7:00 a.m. in winter. Sunset varies between 5:40 p.m. in winter and 7:10 p.m. in summer. St. Croix does not use the daylight saving time. The ultraviolet index or UV index varies from 10+ UV index in the summer and a maximum of 7 UV index in winter. Persistent Easterly trade winds, moving from east to west across the island year round create a cool breeze. Rainforests are located on this western side of St. Croix due to the topography and 1,400 foot peaks and the tradewinds. This rainforest climate is unique to the Frederiksted side of St. Croix.

Mid-1950s Stewart-Warner automotive instruments in \\"Hollywood\\" panel The company was founded as Stewart & Clark Company in 1905 by John K. Stewart. Their speedometers were used in the Ford Model T. In 1912 John Stewart joined with Edgar Bassick to make vehicle instruments and horns. Bassick owned Alemite Co. and Stewart had bought the Warner Instrument Company; thus the name was changed to the Stewart-Warner Corporation. The company started in Chicago and built a manufacturing plant on Diversey Parkway. The building kept expanding and finally covered one million square feet (93,000 m¬≤) and six floors. At its peak S-W employed 6000 people at the Diversey complex.\\"A Plan for Stewart Warner Site,\\" Chicago Tribune, June 17, 1993 They also made radios and refrigerators, among other products, and produced the ubiquitous \\"zerk\\" grease fitting, named after its inventor, associated with the company. In the last years of the company's Chicago factory, it owned a number of aging six-spindle Brown & Sharpe and New Britain screw machines. Stewart-Warner had other locations, including at 2600 North Pulaski in Chicago, and in later years a distribution center in Elgin, Illinois, located just south of I-90 and east of Rt. 25.The Milwaukee Road in Chicago; book published by the Milwaukee Road Historical Association, 2007, Special Publication Number 6 The company also opened a plant in Harlow, Essex, England in the late 1950s, which became its European headquarters. Stan Hagerman initially was Director of the UK plant, followed by Curtis W. Van Allen in 1960, who later became vice president and general manager of international operations in Chicago. The Diversey Parkway complex was the site of both S-W's international headquarters and the Instrument & Alemite manufacturing operations. \\"Alemite\\" referred to S-W's line of lubricating stations, and \\"Instruments\\" referred to speedometers and similar gauges. The front that faced Diversey was the location of corporate offices, while to the rear was manufacturing with a warehouse south of Diversey. A large employee cafeteria was inside the main building, which also included an underground garage for executives (including CEO Bennett Archambault, who arrived each morning by limousine) with an entrance off Wolcott just north of Diversey. Corporate archives were housed in the basement below the main tower, and executive offices were in the top floors of the tower. Stewart-Warner operated a free shuttle van service for employees who commuted by train to and from the Clybourn Metra (C&NW;) station. In 1981 S-W experienced a labor strike at the Chicago operations.Ackland, Len (1981-03-25). \\"Union votes to end strike at Stewart\\". Chicago Tribune. p. 3, section 4 . The Elgin site was eventually taken over by Middleby Corporation. The main Chicago plant and headquarters of Stewart-Warner along Diversey Parkway in Chicago were located in the Deering Industrial Area in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood. As such, S-W was served by both the Chicago and North Western Railroad on the north side, and by both the Milwaukee Road and C&NW; on the south end at the warehouse north of Clybourn and east of Wolcott. In later years S-W was served by only the C&NW; off tracks along the east side of the S-W plant and parallel to the C&NW; North Line.\\"The Chicago Files: Milwaukee Road's Deering Line;\\" Tom Burke, author, Spring 2006 edition of The Milwaukee Railroader historical journal.

Stewart-Warner ranked 95th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M., The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 The Stewart-Warner name is still in use, but there is no corporate link to the original S-W, and the website is hyphenated: http://www.stewart-warner.com. Stewart-Warner was also a manufacturer and distributor of scoreboards, beginning in 1966. Scoreboards created and installed by Stewart-Warner during the 1960s and 1970s included those at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York; Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium; Fenway Park in Boston, Tiger Stadium in Detroit; Exhibition Stadium in Toronto; Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Anaheim Stadium, Arrowhead Stadium and Royals Stadium in Kansas City; Aloha Stadium in Honolulu; Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey; McNichols Sports Arena and Mile High Stadium in Denver; Milwaukee County Stadium in Wisconsin; Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh; Veterans Stadium and the Spectrum in Philadelphia; Busch Stadium in St. Louis; and the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. The latter featured the first videoscreen in a stadium or arena, the Telscreen. Perhaps most famously, Stewart-Warner supplied the scoreboards for the six stadia that hosted the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina as a joint venture with Argentinian state company Autotrol. Stewart-Warner 7400 Series integrated circuit In 1963, Stewart-Warner established an integrated circuit fabrication facility, Stewart-Warner Microcircuits, in Sunnyvale, California. In the mid-1980s, Stewart-Warner's scoreboard division was sold off to another Chicago company, White Way Sign, which took over the maintenance, upgrading and replacement of most of these aforementioned scoreboards. The last CEO of Stewart-Warner was Bennett Archambault, who died in 1996. He was appointed president and CEO in 1954.Chicago Tribune obituary On September 9, 1987, British Tire & Rubber BTR plc entered into an agreement \\"Stewart-Warner, BTR Reach Merger Agreement:\\" AP News Archive to purchase Stewart-Warner.\\"The Chicago Files: Milwaukee Road's Deering Line;\\" Tom Burke, author, Spring 2006 edition of The Milwaukee Railroader historical journal.

Maxima Technologies was then acquired by Actuant Inc., a diversified multi-national industrial corporation in 2006, and renamed Maximatecc. Currently Stewart Warner is headquartered in Lancaster, and is a part of Actuant's Engineered Solutions Business Segment. On April 25, 1993, a spectacular fire destroyed most of the empty S-W Chicago headquarters and factory buildings.

Under Sakiewicz' watch, the NLL has experienced huge growth, expanding from nine to 13 teams, and has seen an increase in attendance every year starting with the 2016-2017 season. Sakiewicz also secured the largest media rights deal in the history of the league, partnering with B/R Live, Turner's live streaming service, for all games to be streamed on the platform starting with the 2018-2019 season. Previously, Sakiewicz was a founder, operating partner and CEO of the Philadelphia Union and a former professional soccer goalkeeper. He is a 21-year veteran of Major League Soccer and was part of a small group of people that started the League in 1995. He helped launch the league as its first Vice President of Sponsorship Sales and went on to serve as the president and general manager of two inaugural teams, the Tampa Bay Mutiny and the MetroStars. He also led the efforts to build two soccer-specific stadiums (New York and Philadelphia) and was cofounder of Major League Soccer's 16th expansion franchise, the Philadelphia Union. Until October 2015, he served as the CEO and Operating Partner of Keystone Sports & Entertainment, LLC, the ownership group of the Philadelphia Union. He played in both the Major Indoor Soccer League and American Professional Soccer League and coached at the youth and college levels. Early life and playing career Sakiewicz, the son of a Polish immigrant father and mother, attended the University of New Haven where he played on the school's NCAA Division II soccer team from 1979 to 1982. He was a 1981, 1982 and 1983 All New England and 1982 Division II Second Team All American goalkeeper.1982 NSCAA All Americans After graduating from New Haven, he moved to Europe where he played in FC Nantes as a developmental player. He also spent a short time with Belenenses of Portugal in 1984. He returned to the United States and played for the New York Arrows of the Major Indoor Soccer League during the 1983-1984 season.MISL statistics He spent an extended hiatus from the professional game after a serious leg injury and pursued business opportunities, continuing with the game by coaching and playing at the amateur level. In 1990, he returned to the professional game for one season with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the American Professional Soccer League.1990 Tampa Bay Rowdies Following his retirement as a player, Sakiewicz coached youth soccer in Florida and was an assistant coach with the College of Boca Raton. In the late 1980s, Sakiewicz was a co-owner of the South Florida- based Ezell-Titterton Inc. Major League Soccer In 1995, Sakeiwicz joined Major League Soccer as a founding executive and was named the first Vice President of Commercial Sponsorship Sales for the league. During his tenure as an MLS executive, Sakiewicz helped grow the league from ten teams in 1996 to 23 teams before leaving for the NLL in late 2015. =Tampa Bay Mutiny= In October 1996, he became the President and General Manager of the Tampa Bay Mutiny.[5] and was named MLS Executive of the Year in 1999. =New York MetroStars= In 2000, he left to become President and General Manager of the MetroStars and won a second consecutive MLS executive of the year after the MetroStars finished atop the Eastern Division in the regular season. Over five seasons the MetroStars appeared in the 2003 U.S. Open Cup final and qualified for the MLS playoffs four times, but only won one playoff series. The team improved their sponsorship revenue and local broadcasting contracts under his management. Sakiewicz helped engineer the deal the build a soccer-specific stadium, Red Bull Arena. During the 2005 season, Sakiewicz was promoted to President of AEG New York, LLC, where he oversaw the record-breaking $100 million sale of the MetroStars to Red Bull Energy Drink Company in 2006. In November 2007 he left AEG to become the co-founder and CEO of the Philadelphia Union, which were announced as the 16th MLS franchise in February 2008 and began play in 2010. =Philadelphia Union= Sakiewicz led all efforts in planning and construction of the Union's soccer-specific stadium PPL Park, including securing naming rights and other key sponsorships. On October 2, 2015, Sakiewicz was removed from his duties as CEO and Operating Partner of the Philadelphia Union. Majority owner Jay Sugarman cited a difference in philosophy regarding the management of the franchise as the reason for his dismissal. Sakiewicz had also developed a contentious relationship with fans and the local media. In May 2015 he was the target of a protest by Philadelphia Union fans at PPL Park. Following his dismissal, allegations arose that Sakiewicz had threatened members of the local media with libel suits for their reporting on the franchise. On January 7, 2016, Sakiewicz was introduced as the fifth commissioner in the history of the National Lacrosse League.  National Lacrosse League  Since taking over as commissioner, Sakiewicz has partnered with Twitter to live stream select games, increased ticket sales and led the way in launching NLL TV. In March 2018, Sakiewicz secured the largest media rights deal in the history of the league, partnering with B/R Live, Turner's live streaming service, for all games to be streamed on the platform starting with the 2018-2019 season. Under Sakiewicz' watch, the league has seen attendance growth for three consecutive years and games routinely average 10,000 fans per game. Sakiewicz' biggest impact has come with league expansion. The last time the league added expansion franchises before Sakiewicz took over as commissioner was in 2007, when the Chicago Shamrox and the New York Titans joined the league. Starting with the 2008 season, the league saw continued consolidation, with the league going from 13 teams in 2007 to nine teams in 2012. Under his watch, the NLL has grown back to 13 teams, and Sakiewicz has repeatedly stated his intention to grow the league by two teams per year to eventually reach 20-30 teams. Sakiewicz' biggest initiative for expansion franchises is to get what he calls \\"blue-chip owners\\" in the league, with teams who have favorable arena deals and to be in a good sports and entertainment market. The first team to be announced as an expansion franchise was the San Diego Seals on August 30, 2007. Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the Chinese e-commerce platform Alibaba Group, was announced as the ownership group. Two weeks later, on September 14, 2017, the NLL awarded an expansion franchise to Comcast Spectacor to return the Wings to Philadelphia. Tsai and Comcast each paid a reported $5 million for their expansion franchises. On September 13, 2018, Sakiewicz announced that the Rochester KnightHawks would be moving to Halifax, Nova Scotia for the 2019-2020 season. Rochester will be awarded an expansion franchise under the ownership of Terry and Kim Pegula, who also own the Buffalo Bandits. On December 11, 2018, Sakiewicz announced that New York would be awarded an expansion franchise to begin play during the 2019-2020 season. The team will play at the newly renovated NYCB LIVE, home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, and will be owned by live events and sports media entertainment company GF Sports Sakiewicz also oversaw the sale and move of the Vancouver Stealth from previous owner, Denise Watkins, to the Canucks Sports & Entertainment group. The Stealth moved from Langley Events Centre to the Rogers Arena and were rebranded as the Vancouver Warriors, starting with the 2018-2019 season.

Throughout its existence, they released demo tapes, one EP and three studio albums. Vio-lence is best-known for their association with the 1980s Bay Area thrash metal scene, and often credited as one of the leading lights of the second wave of the genre, along with Pantera, Sepultura, Sacred Reich, Dark Angel, Annihilator and Flotsam and Jetsam as well as their Bay Area counterparts Testament, Death Angel and Forbidden. Their most stable line-up was Phil Demmel and Robb Flynn on guitars, Deen Dell on bass, Perry Strickland on drums and Sean Killian on vocals; this lineup recorded all their studio albums. After breaking up in 1994 and reforming for occasional live performances from 2001 to 2003, the members of Vio-Lence reunited in January 2018 for a benefit of Killian, who was battling with liver cirrhosis. The band announced their third reunion in January 2019. History =Initial career= Vio-lence, then-called Death Penalty, was formed in 1985 with the line-up of Jerry Birr (vocals), Phil Demmel (guitar), Troy Fua (guitar), Eddie Billy (bass ‚Äì brother of musicians Andy and Chuck Billy) and Perry Strickland (drums). Not long after playing their first gig, which reportedly took place at a house party, Death Penalty changed their name to Violence and eventually then to Vio-lence, as the former was taken by another band. After recording two demos in 1986, they parted ways with Birr, Fua and Billy, who were replaced by Sean Killian, Robb Flynn (formerly of Forbidden Evil) and Deen Dell respectively. Their live success at local clubs in Northern California ‚Äì opening for bands like D.R.I., Voivod, Kreator, Dark Angel, Suicidal Tendencies and the Mentors, as well as their Bay Area thrash metal peers Testament, Exodus, Death Angel, L»ß»ßz Rockit and Heathen ‚Äì allowed Vio-lence to record another demo, this time for major labels, including MCA Records' sister label Mechanic, who offered them a recording contract. From February to April 1988, Vio-lence recorded their debut album, Eternal Nightmare, at two studios: The Music Grinder in Los Angeles and Alpha & Omega in San Francisco. The album received mostly positive reviews upon its release in the summer of 1988, and peaked at number 154 on the Billboard 200, becoming the band's only album to enter that chart;Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Albums. 6th edn, p. 1105. this can be attributed to the album selling over 30,000 copies. Vio-lence toured throughout 1988 and 1989 in support of Eternal Nightmare, with bands such as Testament, Voivod, Death Angel, Sanctuary, Nuclear Assault, D.R.I., M.O.D. and the Cro-Mags. The underground success of the album also caught the attention of several labels, including Megaforce Records (then-home to bands such as Testament, M.O.D., Anthrax, and Overkill), who eventually signed the band. In December 1989, Vio-lence entered the studio to record what would be their second album and only release on Megaforce (distributed by Atlantic) Oppressing the Masses; however, the album faced multiple delays until its release in the summer of 1990. Although the album's success did not match that of Eternal Nightmare, it received some positive reviews and a video for the song \\"World in a World\\" was released. Oppressing the Masses also generated some controversy, when the original album (which reportedly sold only 20,000 copies) was destroyed because of Atlantic's objection to the lyrical content of \\"Torture Tactics\\"; as a result, the album was reprinted without this track. Vio-lence toured in support of the album for about a year, with bands such as Overkill, Exodus, Forbidden, Flotsam and Jetsam, Prong, Defiance and Rigor Mortis. In 1991, after being dropped from Atlantic/Megaforce, Vio-lence released an EP Torture Tactics, which included three studio songs (recorded in 1989 during the sessions of Oppressing the Masses) and one \\"live\\" track from 1988. Internal conflicts in 1992 resulted in the departure of Robb Flynn who would move on to form groove metal band Machine Head. A year later, Vio-lence released their third and final album, Nothing to Gain, which was actually recorded in 1990. They never toured in support of that album, and Strickland left the band after its release. =Breakup= After an attempt to make a fourth album, and performing what would be their final show for eight years on December 18, 1993 with a new lineup in San Francisco, Vio-lence split up. Phil Demmel, Deen Dell, Ray Vegas and Mark Hernandez formed a groove/thrash metal band called Torque which disbanded after releasing a studio album and playing several live shows. Demmel then went to form Technocracy. Robb Flynn has been the guitarist and singer of Machine Head since its inception in 1991. Demmel joined Machine Head in 2003, first as a session guitarist and later becoming a full-time member of the band; he would stay in Machine Head until his departure in 2018. =Reunion= Initially planning only a few shows as part of the tribute to Testament frontman Chuck Billy during the Thrash of the Titans benefit in 2001, the band decided to reunite with early guitarist Ray Vegas replacing Robb Flynn. In addition to their 2005 re-release of Eternal Nightmare, the band released a 7-inch vinyl record containing two demo tracks from their original 1986 demo tape as well as one previously unreleased track. Only 1000 copies were produced and pressed by Bone Crusher Records. The 7 inch collectible was well marketed and advertised, but due to disagreements between the band and the Bone Crusher record producers, only Vio-lence was allowed to distribute and sell the 500 given to them by the producers. A deal was made to distribute a small quantity (about 100) through a Seattle record store, the only known store to stock the item for sale to the public. A DVD entitled Blood And Dirt was produced by Jerry Allen (Tales From The Pit video magazine) and released on August 8, 2006 through Megaforce. On November 6, 2017, it was announced that the members of Vio-Lence would reunite for a performance at \\"Killian on Command: An Evening of Vio-Lence\\", a benefit for the band's singer Sean Killian, who was diagnosed with stage four liver cirrhosis earlier that summer. The benefit took place at The Midway in San Francisco, California on January 20, 2018, and included performances by the members of Vio-Lence and their Bay Area thrash metal peers Testament, Exodus, Death Angel, Forbidden and Mordred. The show concluded with a performance of \\"World in a World\\" featuring four-fifths of the Eternal Nightmare and Oppressing the Masses lineup; vocals were provided by Flynn instead of Killian, who did not perform due to his health condition. On November 11, 2018, Killian's wife Dana posted a photo on her personal Facebook page, cryptically confirming that her husband has recovered from his illness. The possibility of a Vio-lence reunion was renewed in September 2018 when Flynn announced that guitarist Phil Demmel was leaving Machine Head after a farewell tour with then-current lineup of Flynn, Demmel, Jared MacEachern and Dave McClain; at first it was speculated that Machine Head was actually breaking up, but Flynn announced shortly thereafter that he was going to continue the band with a new lineup. Musical outlets reported in November 2018 that, following Demmel's departure from Machine Head, there were rumors Vio-lence would reform \\"in the not-too-distant future\\" for shows and possibly new music. On January 8, 2019, it was announced that Vio-lence would reunite for a performance on April 13 at the Metro in Oakland to perform their debut album, Eternal Nightmare, in its entirety. The show intended as a one-off sold out shortly after its announcement, resulting in a matinee appearance at the Metro, which took place on the following day. On February 16, 2019, it was announced that Vio-lence would play their first European show at the Alcatraz Metal Fest in Kortrijk, Belgium that August. In addition to their first live appearance in Los Angeles in over a decade on May 31, 2019 at The Regent with Sacred Reich, Excel and Sworn Enemy, they played their first shows in New York in nearly 30 years at the Brooklyn Bazaar on November 8‚Äì9. The band also will reportedly play shows with their Bay Area thrash metal peers Testament and Death Angel, and has continued their reunion with more shows into 2020. On August 9, 2019, Bloodstock Open Air announced that Vio-lence would be playing their first ever and only UK show at the festival in 2020. The members of Vio-lence have expressed their desire to write the follow-up to 1993's Nothing to Gain. In an August 2019 interview with Australia's Heavy magazine, Demmel said, \\"Sean's itching to write some new music. I'm not itching as hard. I've got a lot on my plate. Vio-lence is definitely a priority, but that's just a step I haven't... It's hard, because you have this comeback, and then you play the songs, and you want to be good. I don't want to put out something that isn't as good as Eternal Nightmare or some of the songs from Oppressing. I want to have something that's quality.\\" In an interview with Exodus frontman Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza on his \\"Toxic Vault\\" video channel, Killian stated, \\"Phil and I have talked a couple of times. It's kind of up to him because he is very busy doing a soundtrack for a video game and I guess a Netflix series, and he's doing Allegiance and these other things he's doing.\\" Killian also said that the other members of Vio-lence are interested in writing a new album; however, he concluded that \\"it's Phil and I that need to connect.\\" In January 2020, Ray Vegas announced that he had left Vio-lence and was replaced by former Overkill guitarist Bobby Gustafson. Longtime bassist Deen Dell left the band shortly thereafter and was replaced by former Fear Factory bassist Christian Olde Wolbers. In March 2020, it was announced that Vio-lence had signed to Metal Blade Records and the band was going to record a new EP in the coming months. On August 20, 2020, Vio-lence released their first song in over 25 years, which was a cover of Dead Kennedys' \\"California √úber Alles\\". Vio-lence will promote their new EP by headlining the 2021 installment of the MTV Headbangers Ball tour in Europe, with support from Voivod, Exciter and Artillery.

A researcher of natural history, she was an author and illustrator of natural history texts as well as a co-author of natural history texts with her husband, Louis Agassiz, and her stepson Alexander Agassiz. Agassiz accompanied her husband on his journey to Brazil in 1865-6 and on the Hassler expedition in 1871-2; of the second, she wrote an account for the Atlantic Monthly. She published A First Lesson in Natural History (Boston, 1859) and edited Geological Sketches (1866). Early life and education Elizabeth Cabot Cary was born on December 5, 1822 into a Boston Brahmin family of New England ancestry. She was born at the house of her grandfather, Thomas Handasyd Perkins, on Pearl Street in Boston, Massachusetts. Her parents were Mary Ann Cushing Perkins Cary and Thomas Graves CaryPaton, Lucy Allen. Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz; a biography. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1919. (who was a graduate of Harvard University in 1811). The Cary and Perkins families were from England, and came to Massachusetts during the seventeenth century. Elizabeth Cary was the second of five daughters and seven children and was referred to as \\"Lizzie\\" by her immediate family and close friends.\\"AGASSIZ, Elizabeth Cabot Cary (Dec. 5, 1822-June 27, 1907)\\". Notable American Women: 1607‚Äì1950. Boston: Harvard University Press, 1971. Because of her fragile health, she was tutored at home in Temple Place, Boston, which included the study of languages, drawing, music, and reading. She additionally received informal history lessons from Elizabeth Peabody. Career Portrait of Agassiz, 1852 She traveled with her husband and family to Charleston, South Carolina for his professorship in the medical school throughout the winters of 1851-1852 and 1852‚Äì1853. She also visited Europe with him in 1859. She worked closely with her husband in his scientific research. Specifically, she accompanied him as the main writer and record keeper for the Thayer Expedition to Brazil, from April 1865 to August 1866, and the Hassler Expedition through the Strait of Magellan, from December 1871 to August 1872. In 1856, in their home in Cambridge, Agassiz founded a school for girls from Boston. Her husband supported her by giving courses as well as arranging for courses from other Harvard professors. After the closure of the school in 1863 she helped organize and manage The Thayer Expedition with her husband, who she accompanied to Brazil (1865‚Äì1866). This expedition, occurring from 1865‚Äì1866, came at the end of the American Civil War, its maiden voyage from New York to Rio de Janeiro beginning in the war's final week. In 1867, she began a correspondence with Arnold Guyot, a geologist and meteorologist. She also helped organize and manage the next expedition (the Hassler Expedition in 1871-1872), which was the first important U.S. government marine exploration, and made transcripts. After her husband's death in 1873, she published several books on natural history for which she had conducted research for many years.Bailey, Martha J. (1994). American Women in Science: A Biographical Dictionary. ABC-CLIO, Inc. . Agassiz contributed to the founding of the coeducational Anderson School of Natural History. She was (from 1869) one of the first women members of the American Philosophical Society (with Mary Fairfax Somerville and Maria Mitchell); she became a member on October 15. =Society for the Private Collegiate Instruction for Women= In 1879, she was one of seven female managing directors of the Society for the Private Collegiate Instruction for Women (Harvard Annex). This provided qualified women who intended to pursue an advancement in their education in Cambridge with the opportunity to have private tuition from professors at Harvard College. Agassiz was essential in ensuring that the \\"Harvard Annex\\" for women's education was transformed in 1894 from Harvard University into Radcliffe College. From 1894 to 1900, this college was under their direction and from 1900 to 1903 she was honorary president. With her tact and her fundraising skills she promoted the college and contributed significantly to its continuity. Agassiz became a member of the Ladies' Visiting Committee for the Kindergarten for the Blind, under the Perkins Institution for the Blind. She acted as treasurer for the Cambridge branch of the committee until an illness in 1904. = Research and published works = Her research can be studied throughout her published books in addition to her series of diary entries depicting her global ventures. Her publications include A First Lesson in Natural History (1859) and Seaside Studies in Natural History (1865), in which she was assisted by her stepson, Alexander Emanuel Agassiz. Elizabeth Agassiz originally published A First Lesson under the pseudonym Actaea. Additionally, Elizabeth Agassiz co-authored A Journey in Brazil (1868)Agassiz, Elizabeth Cabot Cary. Diary of Elizabeth Cabot Cary Agassiz, May, 1865. A Journey in Brazil. Boston: Ticknor & Co., 1868. and edited and published Louis Agassiz: His Life and Correspondence in 1885. A biography of Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz was later written by her sister Emma F. Cary and Lucy Allen Paton, published in the Spring of 1917 with the assistance of the Council of Radcliffe College.  Personal life  Gravestone of Louis and Elizabeth Agassiz Following the marriage of her older sister Mary to Harvard Professor Cornelius Conway Felton (later president of Harvard University), she began socializing with a group of intellectuals in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1846, she met scientist Louis Agassiz at a dinner with Mary and her husband. Though they wanted to marry, he still had a wife and three children (Pauline, Ida and Alexander) in Switzerland. His wife died in 1848. In December 1849‚Äîwhen socially acceptable to wed‚ÄîLizzie's father gave his blessing. They married on April 25, 1850 in Boston, Massachusetts at King's Chapel. Agassiz organized the household and took care of the finances and the children. She developed strong relationships with her step-children, Alexander, Ida, and Pauline, and her grandchildren. She had no children of her own. After her husband's death in 1873, she continued to devote time to her work and family. She continued to enjoy traveling, and in 1892, Agassiz ventured with family to the Pacific Coast, specifically California, for three months. She died on June 27, 1907 in Arlington, Massachusetts of a cerebral hemorrhage. She is buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery with her husband. The monument is a boulder selected from the moraine of the Aar Glaciers, near where Agassiz once lived.

He served as the 39th mayor of San Francisco, California from 1988 to 1992 and as the Regional Head of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1993 to 2001. Biography =Early life= Agnos was born Arthouros Agnos in Springfield, Massachusetts, to Greek immigrants. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Bates College and a Master of Social Work from Florida State University. He moved to San Francisco in 1966 and went to work at the San Francisco Housing Authority as a social worker with senior populations. On December 13, 1973, Agnos, who was then a member of the California Commission on Aging, was attending a meeting in the largely black public housing project in the San Francisco neighborhood of Potrero Hill, to discuss building a publicly funded health clinic in the area. After the meeting concluded, he was shot twice in the chest at point-blank range. His life was saved only by the downward trajectory of the bullets, and by his own account he lost a year of his life to recuperation. This was one attack of the Zebra murders and attempted murders in the city from October 1973 to April 1974. The 15 known killings and attempted murders were perpetrated by an offshoot group of the Nation of Islam, in which \\"points\\" were earned by killing a white person. Ch. 4 KRON-TV interview with Art Agnos from January 31, 1974, in which Agnos describes being shot twice in the back =Early political career= Agnos was asked by California State Assemblyman Leo McCarthy to join his staff in January 1968. McCarthy was elected Speaker of the Assembly in 1974 and Agnos became his Chief of Staff. During this period, Agnos helped obtain the first California state funding for community- based mental-health services serving the lesbian and gay community, helped pass nursing-home reform, and worked for preservation of farm land. In 1976, Agnos was elected to the California State Assembly, defeating Harvey Milk in the Democratic primary in the 16th District, which at the time covered the eastern neighborhoods of San Francisco. He served as the Chair of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee and as chair of the health subcommittee of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. Agnos also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on South East Asian Refugees. Agnos authored legislation that received national attention for innovative approaches to challenges in health care, welfare, and civil rights, among other areas. He authored California's model welfare reform, GAIN, that matched work requirements with funding for job training, education, and child care.Los Angeles Times, September 25, 1985, \\"Liberals Provided Key; California's Workfare; Compromise All Around\\" Agnos also authored much of California's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, working directly with President Reagan's Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, M.D., and the President of the National Academy of Sciences, David Baltimore, M.D.L A Times, March 4, 1987, \\"A Chance to Move Quickly\\" Although Agnos arranged for the nation's first Joint Legislative Session on the AIDS/HIV epidemic with Koop and Baltimore, the comprehensive approach to the epidemic failed to muster a majority of votes when the governor failed to support the measure. Since then, nearly all aspects of Agnos' proposals have become law and policy in California. Agnos also authored laws that provide support for family caregivers, fair child-support payments with a calculation that remains known as the Agnos calculator, safeguards against brain damage in the boxing ring, and legislation to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.San Diego Union, March 14, 1984, \\"Veto of Gay Job Rights Bill Brings Criticism, Praise.\\" =Mayor of San Francisco= In 1987, Agnos ran for mayor to replace Dianne Feinstein, who was term-limited. Agnos came from behind to defeat Supervisor John Molinari, garnering 70 percent of the vote. Agnos took San Francisco in a different direction, agreeing to a consent decree opposed by Feinstein that opened the way for hiring and promotion of African-Americans and women in the fire department. He changed the priorities for the Redevelopment Commission from creating economic and business opportunities to focus on housing, resulting in the largest increase in affordable housing in twenty years. He disbanded the police unit that had engaged in spying on demonstrations. He empowered the Commission on the Status of Women with subpoena powers and independence and named more minorities and lesbians and gay men to top city commissions and department directors than ever before. He was the first mayor to ride in the annual LGBT Freedom Parade. During his term, the city won top bond ratings, ended deficit spending, and endorsed comparable worth and domestic partners, including health insurance for city workers. Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, Agnos refused to move homeless people forced from shelters until new housing was available, which led to a nine-month presence in Civic Center, changing the earlier policy of simply moving homeless from one place to another. In 1991, Agnos lost his re-election bid to the former police chief who promised to put the city \\"back on track\\" and who was strongly supported by the firefighters and others opposed to Agnos's policy initiatives. Agnos' liberalism also ran counter to other conservative interests. As mayor, Agnos and his family became the first to ride in the Lesbian Gay Freedom Day Parade, appointed minorities, lesbians and gays to high city posts, and ended the city's opposition to a court-ordered consent decree to hire and promote minorities and women in the fire department which a federal judge opined was \\"out of control\\" due to racism when Agnos took office.San Francisco Chronicle, February 7, 1990, \\"Agnos Assails Suit Opposing Black Fireman\\" Agnos ended a police department policy seen as permitting spying on local political organizations and ended the Department's Tactical Squad that critics blamed for abusing citizens. Agnos also strengthened civilian oversight of the Police Department. Agnos is best known for leading the city through the recovery of the Loma Prieta earthquake, the worst since 1906, and the decision to tear down the Embarcadero Freeway (SR 480), a double-decker freeway along the city's Embarcadero that was a wall between the waterfront and the city. His decision was strongly opposed by the Chamber of Commerce and the Chinatown community, who found the freeway a convenience for business purposes, and nearly 25,000 signatures were collected to put a measure on the ballot to repeal the decision to tear down the freeway. Once Agnos obtained federal funding, that opposition melted away. A 6‚Äì5 vote at the city's Board of Supervisors paved the way to tear down the freeway, which led to the start of a decades-long effort to open up the San Francisco waterfront into what is widely considered one of the best outcomes from the earthquake. However, Agnos's 1991 opponent used the decision to play to Chinatown's sentiments and indicated he opposed tearing down the freeway. In 1991, Chinatown played a significant role in his failure to win re-election. Agnos lost in a 51.5%‚Äì48.5% election by a few thousand votes, almost the same as the Chinatown vote. In recent years, Agnos's decision has been looked to by city leaders and elected officials in Seattle and Toronto, Canada, where Agnos' Embarcadero result is considered a potential model for replacing elevated freeways in urban areas.KIRO Channel 7 Eyewitness News, February 28, 2007 \\"Elevated Waterfront Freeway Torn Down; Example for Seattle?\\" Under Agnos, the waterfront transit system gained an uninterrupted streetcar line with historic trolley cars running from Fisherman's Wharf in the north to Mission Bay in the south.San Francisco Chronicle, October 17, 2004, 15 Seconds that Changed the World\\" Agnos added to the waterfront by laying plans for the city's first public access pier, Pier 7, to allow pedestrians to walk out into the Bay. Today, San Francisco has dedicated a new public pier, Pier 14, to honor Agnos for his leadership in opening the city's waterfront.Beyondchron.org, June 16, 2006, \\"New Public Pier Dedicated to Former Mayor Art Agnos\\" Agnos' San Francisco struggled with homelessness, a challenge that faced a number of cities in the late 1980s. Agnos convened a task force of providers, homeless advocates, city agency representatives and others to develop an approach that hoped to end the reliance on overnight shelters in favor of programs to help homeless individuals and families become self-reliant. The plan, Beyond Shelter, won national recognition and awards.New York Times, July 19, 1990, \\"SF Homeless Shelter Spartan but Hospitable\\" The 1989 earthquake resulted in the loss of more than 1,000 low-rent housing units, including units housing those recovering from homelessness. Agnos championed changes in earthquake recovery programs from the federal and state government and from the Red Cross that provided funds to build new facilities and housing to implement the Beyond Shelter program and to restore arts programs and facilities. In 1993, the results were named a Finalist in the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. During the nine months that it took to renovate and open the Beyond Shelter multiservice centers, Agnos allowed homeless individuals to camp in the park in front of City Hall, saying that the alternative was to drive them into neighborhoods and that, as long as they were in front of City Hall, city leaders would be confronted daily with the urgency of the crisis. Critics dubbed the result \\"Camp Agnos\\" and called on him to use police force to remove them, which Agnos refused to do. Agnos remained committed to a program of expanding affordable, low-cost housing in San Francisco. The city increased funding to repair and rehabilitate public housing by 300 percent, changing the vacancy rate from ten percent to one percent. He increased other affordable housing production from 342 units when he took office to 2,240 units, winning San Francisco's first national recognition from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for Excellence in Rental Rehabilitation and a Special Achievement Award. Agnos signed a law establishing domestic partner recognition for lesbian and gay couples that had been vetoed by his predecessor, which then became a target of repeal efforts.Associated Press, June 5, 1989, \\"San Francisco Mayor Signs Domestic Partner Bill\\" In 1989, voters narrowly repealed domestic partner recognition. Agnos moved forward with a Family Policy Task Force that recommended broad changes to San Francisco policy and law, including health insurance for domestic partners of city workers. In 1991, the city formally adopted domestic partner health insurance rights for the city's 20,000 employees, the largest employer to do so at that time.San Francisco Chronicle, May 8, 1991, \\"Domestic Partners Policy Cost\\" In 1991, San Francisco voters approved a new domestic partners recognition law for the city. Agnos served as Chair of the US Conference of Mayors AIDS Task Force, where he organized the lobbying effort that resulted in passage of the Ryan White Care bill.San Francisco Chronicle, March 14, 1990, \\"Agnos to Head AIDS Panel\\" He implemented the policies he advocated as a state legislator, including a 98 percent increase in the city's AIDS budget. He created the Mayors Task Force on the AIDS/HIV Epidemic staffed by Dr. Don Francis, a national leader on AIDS/HIV and credited with leading the effort to eradicate smallpox worldwide.San Francisco Chronicle, January 5, 1989, \\"S.F. Civic Leaders Picked for Agnos AIDS Panel\\" During his tenure, Agnos also undertook major improvements to the city's infrastructure. As first lady of San Francisco, Agnos's wife Sherry co-chaired the bond campaigns for public school renovations and a new Main Library at Civic Center, and Agnos designated that the existing Main Library become the new home for the Asian Art Museum that had been in Golden Gate Park. In 1990, Sherry Agnos also raised funds and oversaw the construction of the $2 million Jelani House that has become a most successful drug rehabilitation facility for pregnant addicted women. Agnos ended the nation's longest stalled public works project at Yerba Buena to develop a cultural hub that includes the Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Center, and Yerba Buena Gardens.San Francisco Chronicle, October 21, 1991, \\"Yerba Buena Gardens\\" Agnos also proposed a waterfront site for a new San Francisco Giants ballpark, but the proposal narrowly lost in November 1989 weeks after the Loma Prieta earthquake absorbed public attention. Later the Giants ballpark was sited at the location Agnos designated and built to the same overall design by the architects and developers he selected originally. =Post-mayoral career= During the Clinton administration, Agnos served as Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for California, Arizona, Nevada, and Hawaii. Agnos also served as Acting FHA Commissioner and Acting Assistant Secretary for Housing, as well as Director of the Special Actions Office. Agnos led HUD's effort to uplift San Francisco's Visitacion Valley, blighted by twin 20-story high-rises supported by HUD and which were unsafe for the residents and the community. Agnos created a partnership with the city, the residents, local community leaders, and HUD that led to the demolishing of Geneva Towers in 1998 and a new resident-led housing development of townhouses and apartments. Agnos also crafted a HUD partnership for teacher housing in San Francisco and communities with excess land set aside for schools. Under the program, HUD financing supported construction and rental assistance for housing dedicated for teachers. San Jose, California, has a similar program now in effect. Agnos worked with city leaders throughout the region to create the first funding for homeless coordination between neighboring cities to address concerns that services were not well matched with those in need. Agnos also led an effort to combat predatory lending aimed at minority homeowners and to repeal \\"racial covenants\\" barring non-whites from living or staying overnight in many California communities. Agnos worked with his mentor former California Assembly Speaker and Lt. Governor Leo T. McCarthy to establish the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco. He has frequently been called upon by the US State Department, the National Democratic Institute, the Asia Foundation, and other international bodies to provide leadership development on democracy building, including in the Russian Far East, the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Zaire, Sierra Leone, Angola, Korea, and as one of the first officials to arrive in Bethlehem to offer disaster assistance after the Palestinian-Israeli army siege of the Church of the Nativity ended on May 10, 2002. He also is frequently sought as a speaker on disaster preparedness and recovery. In 2007, Agnos was appointed as receiver for the troubled San Francisco Housing Authority. The Housing Authority sued to block the court order, and the matter went before the California Court of Appeals.San Francisco Chronicle, March 22, 2007, \\"Housing Agency to Challenge Appointment of Agnos.\\" The city still failed to act for two years, while appealing Agnos' appointment. By April 2009, the SF Chronicle reported that continued inaction while Agnos' appointment remained in court \\"seemed to jolt City Hall into action. Agnos never took control of the agency; instead, Fortner resigned under pressure from Newsom, who appointed Mirian Saez, director of operations at Treasure Island, to run the agency on an interim basis before hiring Alvarez. Under Saez and then Alvarez, the agency sold off properties to satisfy the judgments.\\"San Francisco Chronicle, April 10, 2009, \\"Housing Authority Pays Off $3.2 Million.\\" Agnos' most recent projects also include advising the founders of Open House, the first senior housing planned for elderly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in San Francisco as well as a project working with young families seeking to improve neighborhood schools in their neighborhood of Potrero Hill in San Francisco,Potrero Residents Education Fund website. and he has worked as a consultant with Minnesota-based Cargill and Arizona-based DMB Associates on their controversial plan to develop a bay salt pond in Redwood City. Agnos has become involved with restricting the building of new housing in San Francisco. He strongly opposed the 8 Washington condominium project in 2013, in support of \\"No Wall on the Waterfront\\". Agnos also was a prominent advocate for Proposition B, a precedent-setting measure approved by a wide margin by voters in June 2014 that required developments along the waterfront to win voter approval if the plan called for a height that exceeded the height limits established in the Waterfront Land Use plan first approved by voters in 1990 and implemented in 1997. He is also involved with attempts to block the redevelopment of the San Francisco Flower Mart. Personal life The San Francisco Chronicle called Agnos a \\"longtime practical joker\\". Agnos is married to Sherry Hankins and has two sons.

It is located in Mequon, Wisconsin. The campus consists of 22 buildings, including a library that has over 58,000 volumes and a collection of rare pre-18th century theological books. History Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary has been located in several different places throughout its history. =Origins in Watertown= The origins of the school date to 1863, when the main sources of clergy in the Wisconsin Synod were the mission societies in Germany. As the Wisconsin Synod moved to a more conservative and confessional theological stance, the theological character of clergy from the German mission societies came into question. Furthermore, it became more and more difficult to provide pastors in adequate numbers. To alleviate these problems the Wisconsin Synod formed the Theological School of the Wisconsin Synod in Watertown, Wisconsin. The first students met in the professor's home. In 1864 the Wisconsin Synod in convention resolved to provide a permanent building for the seminary. of Watertown land were purchased for $600.00. Ground was broken on July 22, 1864, on what is now the campus of Luther Preparatory School. The building was dedicated on September 14, 1865. The third floor of the building was used for the seminary classes, and the first two levels were used for the synod's college, Northwestern College. =Merger with Concordia Seminary= Because of small enrollments and an increasing desire to enter into fellowship with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, the school merged with Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod's Concordia Seminary in 1870. As part of the merger, it was agreed that the Missouri Synod should actively participate in Northwestern College by providing a professor for the school, and assisting the school with financial support. Wisconsin was to send students to St. Louis, provide a professor, and contribute financial support for Concordia. Each synod was to retain management of its own institution. Six Wisconsin Synod students began study in St. Louis in March, 1870. =WELS reopens the seminary= In 1878, the WELS reopened a seminary in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to help prevent the assimilation of the entire synod into the Missouri Synod. Wisconsin Synod leaders stressed that doctrinal fellowship was possible with the Missouri Synod without organizational unity. Two small houses were rented at the corner of Hubbard & Garfield and served as the school's campus for two years. Prof. Eugen Notz also served as the pastor of St. Marcus Lutheran Church a block away. The school quickly outgrew that limited capacity. The Seminary Board authorized the purchase of a small nearby park at 13th & Vine Sts. to serve as the new campus. The park pavilion was remodeled into classrooms and residence for Prof. Notz. Classes there began in 1880. =The move to Wauwatosa= Because the increasing number of seminarians outgrew the 13th St. facility, a new seminary campus was opened in 1893 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin with 31 students. The facility was a two-story building with a full basement and a large attic. The first floor held two classrooms, a chapel, a faculty lounge, several study rooms, and a restroom in each of the two wings. The second floor mirrored the layout of the first floor, with a large hall in the center. This space was later occupied by the library. The basement contained a kitchen and dining area, a washroom, and a recreation room. Years later, the attic was finished and outfitted for additional student quarters. =A permanent campus in Mequon= As enrollment at Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary continued to increase, synod and seminary administrators realized that a bigger facility would become necessary in the coming years. The synod purchased an farm in present-day Mequon, Wisconsin, near the village of Thiensville for $25,000. Seminary professor John Philip Koehler was given charge of the general design, incorporating the style and features of the Wartburg Castle in Eisenach, Germany. Ground was broken for construction in 1928, and the cornerstone was laid that same year. The process of moving to the new campus began in the summer of 1929 and the first classes were held in the autumn semester of 1929. Campus The Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary campus is situated on 80 acres in Mequon, Wisconsin. With large trees, expansive grassy fields, woods, a stream, and a small holding pond, the campus resembles a park. =Architectural features= The design of the campus mimics the architectural style of the Wartburg Castle in Eisenach, Germany. Features include stone walls and slate roofs. The overall layout of the dormitory and academic center is a ring, creating a courtyard in the center of the main complex. \\"Fachwerk,\\" timber- framed brick walls are also common on the campus. =Buildings= The seminary tower that acts as a gateway to a central courtyard, divides the main building into two areas: the residence hall and dining hall life to the west and administration-classroom building, chapel, and library to the east. The residence hall, consisting of eight units, can accommodate about 80 students. The dining hall seats approximately 150. Between 1997 and 2002 the residence hall was expanded to provide more room for each student. The classrooms were simultaneously remodeled to provide current technology. An auditorium- gymnasium, built in 1986, seats 1200. The campus features these main buildings and areas: *Administration-Classroom *Chapel *Library *Residence and Dining Hall *Gymnasium =Gymnasium= Opened in 1986, the gymnasium seats 1200. The main gymnasium contains two basketball courts and a volleyball court. The building also has a racquetball court, two locker rooms, and an exercise/weight room. The gymnasium is also used for concerts, holiday services, and graduations. =Chapel= Included in the 1929 building project was a chapel for campus worship. The original chapel was quite plain and did not contain any pews, musical instruments, art glass windows, or even a pulpit and altar. It was not until the 1930s that the chancel was decorated with the help of a local craftsman. For decades the chapel featured a small wooden altar, a pulpit, a lectern, wooden pews, tile floors, a Wick's organ, and three art glass windows behind the altar. Unfortunately, the low ceiling and small amount of natural light detracted greatly from the atmosphere. Renovation In 2002 the Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary facilities committee presented a study on the chapel, noting the surface deficiencies of the chapel and pointing out that the chapel architecture did not promote by example the type of liturgical worship practices currently taught at the seminary and commonly in practice among WELS congregations. The committee proposed a chapel renovation. The renovation, funded primarily by special gifts, began in 2004 and took a full year to complete. Construction was completed in May, 2005. A dedication service was not held until the beginning of the following academic year, on August 29, 2005. The new chapel design features large, clear windows to allow natural light to pour into the room. The windows are etched with symbols representing the four theological disciplines. The ceiling is now opened up to the tall gable roof. Dark stone tile floors contrast with the white paint on the walls and ceiling. Other features of the chapel include: * Ambo - The ambo replaces pulpit and lectern as one central location for the reading of Scripture. * Paschal candle - The Paschal candle reminds worshippers of Christ the lamb who was sacrificed for sin. * Font - The baptismal font reminds worshippers of their own baptisms. The design allows for a constant flow of water that adds a gentle sound to the chapel. * Freestanding altar - The altar and chairs are all freestanding and can be moved as needed. In practice, the chapel layout has remained the same since its dedication. Design award In May, 2006 the newly renovated chapel received a merit award from the American Institute of Architects Wisconsin chapter.AIA Wisconsin, 2006 AIA Wisconsin Design Awards =Library= The Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary library houses over 58,000 books, almost all on the subject of theology and the Bible. The library subscribes to over 300 periodicals and journals from around the world, most of which are theological in nature. The library contains more than 2000 rare books, some from as early as 1500. Several examples are on display on the main level on the library. Other features of the library include a World Mission Collection, with mission materials printed in over 30 different languages. The library also maintains a vertical file of over 3000 essays written by Wisconsin Synod pastors and professors, many of which can be accessed on the library's essay file website.

Following demobilisation, he studied psychology and anthropology at the University of Sydney, and between 1953 and 1979 he carried out research amongst the Warlpiri (Walbiri) of Central Australia and the people of Enga Province, Papua New Guinea. Throughout the 1950s he was a lecturer in anthropology at Sydney, but in the 1960s he took up a position as a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York. His works include The Lineage System of the Mae Enga and Desert People: A Study of the Walbiri Aborigines of Australia. But perhaps his most noted work is \\"Blood is Their Argument,\\" an intensive analysis of the warfare habits of the Enga tribes. The book is widely considered to be among the first ethnographic studies of warfare. In his work on the people of Enga in Papua New Guinea Meggitt found a firmly patrilineal system. This was unusual as compared to other highland groups, which tended to be organized on a basis of residence as well as descent. Restudies of his material as well the Enga suggest that Meggitt overstated the case, and the Enga may be more like other highland groups than was thought in previous decades.

A member of the Radical Party, he was chosen as the Popular Front's candidate for the 1938 presidential election, and was elected. He governed Chile until his death in 1941. Pedro Aguirre Cerda was of Basque descent. Early life He was born in Pocuro, a small village near the city of Los Andes, in Chile. The seventh of eleven children of Juan Bautista Aguirre and Clarisa Cerda. His father, a farmer, died when he was eight years old in 1887. His mother had to run the farm and raise him and all his siblings alone. He finished his university studies in Santiago, at the Pedagogic Institute and became a teacher of Spanish in 1900. In 1904 he became a lawyer. He married his cousin Juana Rosa Aguirre Luco, with whom he had no children. In 1910, thanks to a government scholarship he studied administrative and financial law at La Sorbonne, plus political economy and social legislation at the College de France. He returned to Chile in 1914 and took a position as a teacher at the Instituto Nacional. He also became president of the National Society of Teachers. He was a very distinguished teacher, attorney, deputy and senator. He was also the first dean of the new school of economy of the Universidad de Chile. As a member of the Radical Party, he was minister of Public Instruction and of the Interior during the administrations of Juan Luis Sanfuentes and Arturo Alessandri. During the period of military domination, he was persecuted and became an active opposition leader to the government of General Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo. For the 1938 Chilean presidential election, he was the Popular Front candidate, and narrowly defeated conservative candidate Gustavo Ross, mostly because of the political backlash caused by the Seguro Obrero Massacre. Presidency Monument commemorating Pedro Aguirre Cerda in Santiago Pedro Aguirre Cerda was elected and assumed his duties as president on December 25, 1938 under the slogan \\"Gobernar es educar\\" (to govern is to educate.) As a teacher, his priority in government was education. As such, he promoted the development of the technical-industrial schools as a means to promote the formation of technicians for the nascent industrialization of the country. He also created thousands of new regular schools and encouraged the growth of the university system to cover the whole of the country. Aguirre‚Äôs government also redistributed some land, encouraged the formation of agricultural settlements, built low-cost housing and schools, and integrated the Marxist parties into the political system.A History of Chile, 1808-1994, by Simon Collier and William F. Sater During his first year he had to face military opposition to his plans, which boiled over with the so-called Ariostazo. He also promoted and campaigned for a Nobel prize for Gabriela Mistral, which only came to fruition under his successor, Juan Antonio R√≠os. On the economic side, and prompted in part by the devastating earthquake of 1939, he created the Production Development Corporation (Corporaci√≥n de Fomento de la Producci√≥n - CORFO) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization. This was the basis for the industrialization of Chile. From there sprung the steel, manufacturing and sugar industries. In 1941 due to his rapidly escalating illness, he appointed his minister of the Interior, Jer√≥nimo M√©ndez as vice-president. He died soon after, of tuberculosis, on November 25, 1941 in Santiago, Chile. M√©ndez served as acting President until Juan Antonio Rios, elected on February 1, 1942, took office on April 2.

Ace Books) Cover artist: Ron Miller Coyote (2002) is a science fiction novel by American writer Allen Steele. The book is a compilation of some of Steele's short stories into one novel. Perspective is taken from many of the major characters of the book. Coyote is part of a trilogy, that also includes the sequels Coyote Rising and Coyote Frontier. There are three spinoff novels, Spindrift, Galaxy Blues, and Hex, which are set in the same universe, although not directly tied to the events in Coyote. The series is continued by the Coyote Chronicles, a two-book series, including Coyote Horizon, released in March 2009 and Coyote Destiny, which was released on March 2, 2010. Plot summary  The year is 2070, and the United Republic of America, an authoritarian conservative regime constructed after the second revolution, has built its first starship: the URSS Alabama. The welcoming celebration for Captain Robert E. Lee takes a sudden turn when Lee initiates his plan to steal the Alabama. Working with a handful of conspirators, Lee manages to take the ship by the helm and override the clearance codes. URS soldiers climb aboard to stop Lee, but they are too late. Not wishing to abandon their orders, Colonel Reese and the other soldiers become stowaways. Captain Lee knew exactly what he was doing. His destination: the 47 Ursae Majoris system, some 46 light years away‚Äîfar enough to escape the tyrannical United Republic. At a cruise velocity of .2c, Alabama would not arrive at its destination until 230 earth years have passed. So the crew of 104 soldiers, scientists, and civilians were put in biostasis, to be awakened from their virtual immortality by the ship's AI 226 years into the future. (Four years are spared due to time dilation.) 47 Ursae Majoris' system has four planets- named Fox, Raven, Bear and Wolf after Native American mythology. Bear has six satellites- Dog, Hawk, Eagle, Coyote, Snake and Goat. Of these six, Coyote is large enough to support its own biosphere.Coyote, p.158 Just three months into the journey, something goes terribly wrong. Leslie Gillis, the senior communications officer, is awakened from biostasis. Expecting the year to be 2300, Gillis is horrified when he questions the AI. There was a mix up, and now it is inexplicably impossible for Gillis to return to his dreamless sleep. His gruelling options are either suicide or a lonely existence surviving off the ship's supplies. While suicide may be more honorable than devouring his crewmates‚Äô rations, Gillis chooses life. After a brief chat with the AI, Gillis learns that Eric Gunther was originally scheduled to awake three months into the trip. Gunther is an agent for the URA, and would attempt to contact the president, or destroy the ship. The program was changed at the last minute to wake someone else instead - Les Gillis. Gillis leaves a note for Captain Lee explaining Gunther's plans for treason. Why they were changed at the last minute remains a mystery, but it was a change that would cost Gillis his life. During Leslie Gillis‚Äô solitary life, he did everything he could to keep from going insane, attempting to eat and sleep at regular hours, reading all of the books which were on board, playing chess against the AI, writing stories, and painting. Using practically all of the ship's art supplies, Gillis created a story about a prince named Rupurt and the fantastic alien world he lived in. He painted scenes of his books on the ship's inside walls. Eventually, Gillis died in his old age after a fall from a ladder while trying to get a better look at an alien ship he had seen. The AI automatically expelled his body into space with the arms of a maintenance bot, and the ship sailed on to 47 Ursae Majoris with no more incidents. The crew is awakened as planned in the year 2300. The Alabama has entered the 47 Ursae Majoris system and is approaching its third planet, Bear. Bear (currently known as 47 Ursae Majoris b) is a gas giant that orbits 47 Ursae Majoris at 2.1 AUs and Coyote, its fourth moon, is larger even than Mars. This habitable satellite is lush with green plants and rivers of water. This will be the crew's new home. Captain Lee directs the landing procedures of the two ships docked to the Alabama, the Wallace and the Helms. The crew finds Coyote to be habitable, but very peculiar nevertheless. Coyote's seasons change at a much slower rate than Earth's. A year for Coyote consists of 1,096 days with 27 hours per day. Life forms on Coyote seem similar to those on Earth at first glance, but behave in unique ways. As described in Gillis‚Äô novel, the world is home to gigantic bird-like creatures which are anything but friendly. The settlers call them \\"boids\\", which was Gillis‚Äô term for the beasts in his novel. Boids are common in the grasslands around the new settlement. The remainder of Coyote tells of the adventures of Carlos Montero and Wendy Gunther along the banks of the equatorial river which stretches around Coyote.  Characters  *Captain Robert E.

His specimens from Angola and Mozambique were sent out to Portugal, where they were later examined by several zoologists and botanists, chiefly among them J.V. Barboza du Bocage. Life Anchieta was born in 1832, in Lisbon, and started his studies in mathematics at the University of Coimbra. Due to his fierce independence and eccentric character, however, he did not adapt well and moved to the Escola Polit√©cnica de Lisboa (Polytechnic School of Lisbon). In 1857, one of his closest friends moved to Portuguese Cape Verde, a Portuguese colony and a group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa, and Anchieta went to join him. He spent his time studying the local flora and fauna in the island of Santo Ant√£o, and finally ended up helping the local inhabitants as an amateur physician (he had studied some medicine). A cholera epidemic killed most of the inhabitants and he almost died too, but he was able to return to Portugal after two years. Following what he thought was his vocation, he studied medicine in Lisbon, London and Paris, but could not complete the course, and returned to Africa again, this time to Angola, one of the largest West African Portuguese colonies. He was successful as an explorer of the hinterland and as a naturalist, and after studying and collecting many new animal and plant species, he returned to Portugal. Most of his collections were lost when his canoe foundered in a river, but he donated what remained to the natural history museum of the Polytechnic School. Laboratory of Anchieta in Caconda, around 1870 In 1865, he travelled back on his own once again to Angola. This time, he was married and his wife accompanied him. He stayed on his own in the region of Benguela, establishing a laboratory inside the ruins of a church, and exploring and collecting animals, until, in 1867, the Portuguese government hired him, ostensibly as a naturalist. But what is most probable is that Anchieta was recruited as a secret agent and informer in the Caconda region of Angola, one of the most extreme points of its territory. He stayed there, researching, exploring and sending many specimens and letters to his scientific correspondents in Lisbon. He also helped medically in the local hospital and was much appreciated by the population as a dedicated and humane care-giving person. Little is known in the manner of documentation about this period of Anchieta's life, because most of the museum specimens disappeared, as well as his many letters to Bocage, in a catastrophic fire in the museum, in 1978. Anchieta died while returning from a zoological expedition to Caconda, in 1897, at 66 years of age, probably of the chronic consequences of malaria, which he and his wife caught, and which had severely undermined his health for many years. In all, according to Bocage, Anchieta's zoological output was truly prolific. He was responsible for identifying 25 new species of mammals, 46 birds, and 46 amphibians and reptiles. He didn't care much for writing scientific papers, though, but left this to his correspondents in Lisbon. Many of the species of birds, amphibians, lizards, snakes, fishes and mammals collected by him were unknown and thus were named for Anchieta with the species designation anchietae. Some of them were: * Anchieta's sunbird (Anthreptes anchietae), a bird * Anchieta's barbet (Stactolaema anchietae), a bird * Anchieta's tchagra (Tchagra anchietae), a bird * Anchieta's ridged frog (Ptychadena anchietae) * Anchieta's dune lizard (Meroles anchietae)Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The club was founded in 1937 and currently plays in Ligue 2, the second division of French football. Toulouse plays its home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse located within the city. Les Pitchouns have won Ligue 2 on three occasions. Toulouse have participated in European competition five times, including in 2007 when they qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time. Toulouse is presided over by the French businessman Olivier Sadran, who took over the club following its bankruptcy in 2001 which resulted in it being relegated to the Championnat National. The club has served as a springboard for several players, most notably the World Cup-winning goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and international striker Andr√©-Pierre Gignac. History The city was left without a big side in 1967 when Toulouse FC sold its players and place in the French top flight to Paris outfit Red Star, but three years later a new club, Union Sportive Toulouse, rose from the ashes. Adopting red and yellow jerseys, the club started out in Ligue 2 and in 1979 reclaimed the name Toulouse FC. Now wearing purple and white, Les Pitchouns gained top-flight promotion in 1982. A side containing Jacques Santini and Swiss forward Daniel Jeandupeux earned a penalty shoot-out victory against Diego Maradona's Napoli in the 1986‚Äì87 UEFA Cup, Toulouse's maiden European campaign. Toulouse fans celebrate qualifying for the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Champions League After goalkeeper Fabien Barthez made his breakthrough and moved on, Toulouse were relegated in 1994. They subsequently bounced back and forth between Ligues 1 and 2 before slipping to the third flight in 2001 after financial problems. Toulouse were back in the top flight two seasons later, and in 2007 they finished third to earn a place in the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round. There, Liverpool overpowered them 5‚Äì0 on aggregate. In 2008‚Äì09, Toulouse finished fourth in the Ligue 1 table with 64 points, and secured a spot in the new Europa League, while Andr√©-Pierre Gignac led all scorers in Ligue 1 with 24 goals and was awarded a call-up to the French national team. In the 2015‚Äì16 Ligue 1 season, Toulouse avoided relegation to Ligue 2 in the last game of the season. With 12 minutes to go, Toulouse were behind to Angers 2‚Äì1 and needed a win to survive, and scored two late goals and win the match 3‚Äì2. Two years later, they finished 18th and won the promotion/relegation playoff 4-0 on aggregate against Ligue 2's AC Ajaccio. On 6 January 2020, Toulouse dismissed manager Antoine Kombouar√© following the club's 1‚Äì0 loss to Championnat National 2 side Saint-Pryv√© Saint-Hilaire FC in the Coupe de France. Under Kombouar√© the club had lost ten matches in a row, leading him to be dismissed and replaced by Denis Zanko. On 30 April that year, Toulouse were relegated to Ligue 2 after the LFP elected to end the season early due to the coronavirus pandemic. On 21 July 2020, RedBird Capital Partners acquired a 85% stake in Toulouse FC. Name changes * Union Sportive Toulouse (1970‚Äì79) * Toulouse Football Club (1979‚Äìcurrent) Stadium Toulouse play their home matches at the Stadium de Toulouse. Built in 1937, the stadium presently has a capacity of 33,150. The stadium was used as a venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, 2007 Rugby Union World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016. Colours The violet is a reference to one of two Toulouse nicknames: la Cit√© des violettes (the City of Violets), the second one being la Ville rose (the Pink City), which explains the colour of former alternate jerseys. The team's logo displays the gold and blood-red Occitan cross, the symbol of Occitania, of which Toulouse is a historical capital. Club rivalries =Derby de la Garonne= The Derby de la Garonne is a derby match between Girondins de Bordeaux and Toulouse. The derby derives from the fact that Bordeaux and Toulouse are the two major clubs that play in cities that situate themselves along the Garonne River. The consistency and competitiveness of the rivalry developed following Toulouse's return to Ligue 1 after being administratively relegated to the Championnat National in 2001.

He seized power amidst the ensuing chaos following the 15 January 1966 military coup, which decapitated the country's leadership. He ruled from 16 January 1966 until his assassination on 29 July 1966 by a group of mutinous Northern Nigerian officers and men who were led by Major Murtala Mohammed and included Captain Theophilus Danjuma, Lieutenant Muhammadu Buhari, Lieutenant Ibrahim Babangida and Lieutenant Sani Abacha in a revolt against his government in what was popularly called the July Counter Coup.  Early life  Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi was born into the family of Mazi (Mr.) Ezeugo Aguiyi on the 3rd of March 1924, in Ibeku, Umuahia, located in the present-day Abia State, Nigeria. At the age of eight, he went to live with his older sister, Anyamma, who was married to Theophilius Johnson, a Sierra Leonean diplomat working in Umuahia. Aguiyi-Ironsi subsequently took the last name of his brother-in-law as his first name, in admiration of Mr. Johnson for the father-figure role he played in his life. Aguiyi-Ironsi had his primary and secondary school education in Umuahia and Kano, respectively. At the age of 18, he joined the Nigeria Regiment against the wishes of his sister. Military career In 1942, Aguiyi-Ironsi joined the Nigerian Regiment, as a private with the seventh battalion. He was promoted in 1946 to company sergeant major. Also in 1946, Aguiyi-Ironsi was sent on an officer training course in Staff College, Camberley, England. On 12 June 1949, after completion of his course at Camberley, he received a short-service commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal West African Frontier Force, with a subsequent retroactive promotion to lieutenant effective from the same date. Aguiyi- Ironsi was granted a regular commission on 16 May 1953 (seniority from 8 October 1947), and was promoted to captain with effect from the same date (seniority from 8 October 1951). Aguiyi-Ironsi was one of the officers who served as equerry for Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Nigeria, at the time she visited Nigeria in 1956, for which he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). He was promoted to major on 8 October 1958. In 1960, Aguiyi-Ironsi was made commandant of the fifth battalion in Kano, Nigeria, with the rank of lieutenant colonel Later in 1960, Aguiyi-Ironsi headed the Nigerian contingent force of the United Nations Operation in the Congo. From 1961‚Äì1962, Aguiyi-Ironsi served as the military attach√© to the Nigeria High Commission in London United Kingdom. During this period he was promoted to the rank of brigadier. During his tenure as military attach√© he attended courses at the Imperial Defence college (renamed Royal College of Defence Studies in 1961), Seaford House, Belgrave Square. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE) in the 1962 New Year Honours list. In 1964 he was appointed as the commandant of the entire United Nations peace keeping force in the Congo. In 1965, Aguiyi-Ironsi was promoted to the rank of major general. That same year Major General C.B. Welby-Everard handed over his position as the general officer Commanding, GOC of the entire Nigerian Army to Major General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi- Ironsi (making him the first Nigeria indigenous officer to head the entire Nigerian Army). In January 1966, a group of army officers, led by Major Chukwuma Nzeogwu, overthrew the central and regional governments of Nigeria, killed the prime minister, and tried to take control of the government in a failed coup d'√©tat. Nzeogwu was countered, captured and imprisoned by Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. Aguiyi-Ironsi was named military head of state on 17 January 1966, a position he held until 29 July 1966, when a group of northern army officers revolted against the government, and killed Aguiyi- Ironsi.  Fall of the First Republic  On 14 January 1966, Soldiers of mostly Igbo extraction led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, an Igbo from Okpanam near Asaba, present day Delta state, eradicated the uppermost echelon of politicians from the Northern and Western provinces. This and other factors effectively led to the fall of the Republican Government. Though Aguiyi- Ironsi, an Igbo, was purportedly slated for assassination, he effectively took control of Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory.Time Magazine \\"Nigeria: The Men of Sandhurst\\". With President also an Igbo Nnamdi Azikiwe refusing to intervene and insure the continuity of civilian rule, Aguiyi-Ironsi effectively compelled the remaining members of Balewa's Government to resign seeing that the government was in disarray, he then allowed the Senate president Nwafor Orizu, another Igbo who was serving as acting president in Azikiwe's absence, to officially surrender power to him, thus ending the First Nigerian Republic. Head of state Aguiyi-Ironsi inherited a Nigeria deeply fractured by its ethnic and religious cleavages. The fact that none of the high-profile victims of the 1966 coup were of Igbo extraction, and also that the main beneficiaries of the coup were Igbo, led the Northern part of the country to believe that it was an Igbo conspiracy. Though Aguiyi-Ironsi tried to dispel this notion by courting the aggrieved ethnic groups through political appointments and patronage, his failure to punish the coup plotters and the promulgation of the now infamous \\"Decree No. 34\\"‚Äîwhich abrogated the country's federal structure in exchange for a unitary one‚Äî crystallized this conspiracy theory. During his short regime (194 days in office) Aguiyi-Ironsi promulgated a raft of decrees. Among them were the Constitution Suspension and Amendment Decree No.1, which suspended most articles of the Constitution (though he left intact those sections of the constitution that dealt with fundamental human rights, freedom of expression and conscience were left intact). The Circulation of Newspaper Decree No.2 which removed the restrictions on press freedom put in place by the preceding civilian administration. According to Ndayo Uko, the Decree no.2 was to serve \\"as a kind gesture to the press..\\" to safeguard himself when he went on later to promulgate the Defamatory and Offensive Decree No.44 of 1966 which made it an \\"offense to display or pass on pictorial representation, sing songs, or play instruments the words of which are likely to provoke any section of the country.\\" He also as per the proposals of a single man committee passed the controversial Unification Decree No. 34 aimed to unify Nigeria into a unitary state. Counter coup and assassination On 29 July 1966 Aguiyi-Ironsi spent the night at the Government House in Ibadan, as part of a nationwide tour. His host, Lieutenant Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi, Military Governor of Western Nigeria, alerted him to a possible mutiny within the army. Aguiyi-Ironsi desperately tried to contact his Army Chief of Staff, Yakubu Gowon, but he was unreachable. In the early hours of the morning, the Government House, Ibadan, was surrounded by soldiers led by Theophilus Danjuma. Danjuma arrested Aguiyi- Ironsi and questioned him about his alleged complicity in the coup, which saw the demise of the Sardauna of Sokoto, Ahmadu Bello. The circumstances leading to Aguiyi-Ironsi death still remain a subject of much controversy in Nigeria. His body and that of Fajuyi were later discovered in a nearby forest. Legend The swagger stick with a stuffed crocodile mascot carried by Aguiyi-Ironsi was called \\"Charlie\\". Legend had it that the crocodile mascot made him invulnerable and that it was used to dodge or deflect bullets when he was on mission in the Congo. Despite the stories, the crocodile mascot probably had something to do with the fact that the name \\"Aguiyi\\" translates as \\"crocodile\\" in Igbo. Personal life Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi was married to his wife Victoria in 1953. Aguiyi-Ironsi's son, Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi, was appointed to the position of Nigeria's Defence Minister on 30 August 2006 ‚Äì forty years after his father's death. Award Gallantry medal (was awarded by the Austrian Government to Lt Col Aguiyi-Ironsi, Maj Njoku, two expatriates and twelve Nigerian soldiers for their role in the Congo in 1960, in freeing an Austrian ambulance unit which was arrested and imprisoned by the Congolese authorities because they claimed the unit were Belgian parachutists).

In 1998, McDonagh became Labour's first female general secretary, after serving as deputy general secretary the previous year. She was not always popular with the grassroots and parts of the Parliamentary Party due to her perceived 'control-freakery'. She was considered to have badly mishandled the party's London mayoral candidate selection process, which resulted in Ken Livingstone winning the election as an independent candidate, leaving the official Labour candidate Frank Dobson in third place, with subsequent disaffection amongst the party members. McDonagh later apologised for the mayoral electoral loss. Her organisational skills came to the fore however in the delivery of a second landslide victory at the 2001 general election. She was also criticised for accepting, without consultation, a ¬£100,000 donation from Daily Express an adult magazine publisher Richard Desmond, and still counting as party members those in arrears of up to 15 months to delay news of declining membership emerging.

Early life Gouverneur was born in 1799 in New York City. His father was Nicholas Gouverneur (1753‚Äì1802), a merchant with the firm Gouverneur & Kemble, and mother was Hester (n√©e Kortright) Gouverneur (1770‚Äì1842), sister of the First Lady Elizabeth Kortright Monroe. His younger sister, Maria Charlotte Gouverneur (1801‚Äì1867), was married to Thomas McCall Cadwalader (1795‚Äì1873). His maternal grandparents were Lawrence Kortright, a wealthy merchant, and Hannah (n√©e Aspinwall) Kortright. His paternal grandparents were Samuel Gouverneur (1720‚Äì1798) and Experience (n√©e Johnson) Gouverneur (1720‚Äì1788). He was a first cousin of U.S. Representative Gouverneur Kemble (1786‚Äì1875) through his aunt Gertrude Gouverneur, wife of merchant Peter Kemble. He graduated from Columbia College in 1817. Career In 1824, Gouverneur was elected as a People's Party (faction of the Democratic-Republican party) member of the New York State Assembly, serving in the 48th New York State Legislature in 1825. He was aligned with Assembly Speaker Clarkson Crolius, also from New York County. On November 19, 1828, he was appointed Postmaster of New York City, succeeding former U.S. Representative and Senator Theodorus Bailey who died in office on September 6, 1828. While in New York he invested in racehorses, and the Bowery Theatre along with James Alexander Hamilton, son of Alexander Hamilton, and Prosper M. Wetmore. Gouverneur served as Postmaster until July 4, 1836, when he was succeeded by Jonathan J. Coddington. =Relationship with Monroe= Gouverneur served as private secretary to his uncle, the fifth U.S. President James Monroe who served two consecutive terms as President from March 4, 1817 until March 4, 1825. Gouverneur helped former president Monroe to press his claims to Congress to repay mounting debts. After Elizabeth Monroe's death in 1830, Monroe came to live at the Gouverneurs' home, and died there in 1831. Gouverneur was executor of Monroe's estate, which had to be sold off to pay the debts. Monroe was buried in the Gouverneur family vault at the New York City Marble Cemetery, until descendants had the remains moved to the James Monroe Tomb in the Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. A ceremony was held at the Gouverneur vault 175 years later, on July 8, 2006. Monroe's personal papers were left to Gouverneur, who also was asked to support his wife's sister Eliza Monroe Hay (also his cousin, then a widow). Gouverneur started work on publishing the papers or a book on Monroe, but it was never finished. After Mrs. Hay died in 1840, the Gouverneurs moved to Washington, DC where he worked in the consular bureau of the U.S. Department of State from 1844 to 1849. After congress agreed to buy the papers of President Madison, Gouverneur proposed a similar arrangement, which was concluded in 1850. Some personal papers would be retained for a few generations. Personal life On March 9, 1820, Gouverneur was married to Maria Hester Monroe, his first cousin and the daughter of President Monroe. The wedding was officiated by the Rev. William Dickinson Hawley Excerpt from and was the first wedding held in the White House for a child of a president. The wedding was small, with only 42 guests and no cabinet members invited, and General Thomas Jesup served as groomsman for Gouverneur. The couple went on a brief one-week honeymoon, and upon their return, Commodore and Mrs. Stephen Decatur gave them a reception at the Decatur House on May 20, 1820. Another ball was planned, but was cancelled due to Decatur's death two days later in a duel. After moving to New York, the Gouverneur's bought and lived at 63 and 65 Prince Street at Lafayette Street in Manhattan. Together, Samuel and Maria were the parents of three children: * James Monroe Gouverneur (1822‚Äì1885), a deaf-mute who died at the Spring Grove Asylum in Baltimore, Maryland; * Elizabeth Kortright Gouverneur (1824‚Äì1868), who married Dr. Henry Lee Heishell, James M. Bibby, and Colonel G. D.

In 1832, the Gouverneurs' sold their Prince Street residence to Miles R. Burke. On June 20, 1850, his wife Maria died at the Oak Hill estate, which was sold two years later in 1852. In September 1851, the widower Gouverneur married Mary Digges Lee (1810‚Äì1898), a granddaughter of Thomas Sim Lee (1745‚Äì1819). They retired to the Lee estate called \\"Needwood\\", near Frederick, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. This stressed family relations during the American Civil War, with Gouverneur associated with the Union government, while his in-laws had deep roots in the Confederate states. Gouverneur died at his Needwood estate on September 29, 1865. His estate was left to his second wife. =Descendants= His granddaughter Rose de Chine Gouverneur, born in China in 1860, married Roswell Randall Hoes (1850‚Äì1921) and died on May 26, 1933. Their sons Gouverneur Hoes (1889‚Äì1943) and Laurence Gouverneur Hoes (1900‚Äì1978) established the James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library in the Fredericksburg, Virginia building that housed the James Monroe Law Office, administered by the University of Mary Washington.

It is about halfway between City Island and Hart Island and south of High Island. It is one of the Pelham Islands. Description The small irregular island is about in area. It has a dual-humped appearance and is mostly a lump of Manhattan schist bedrock. There is a small channel that cuts into the bedrock on the southern side of the tiny island that was used for launching small boats. This channel is filled with mussel shells. There is a purple-bluish \\"beach\\" made of mussel shells mixed with bird bones on the west side of the island with some reed grass. The highest point on the island is usually covered in gull bird guano and is underwater during high tide storms. The largest inhabitant of the island is usually a great blue heron that sleeps on the island during daytime. History Rat Island was included in the purchase by Thomas Pell in 1654. During the typhoid fever scares of the 1800s, Rat Island was used by Pelham, New York, as a typhoid quarantine hospital for about 40 infected people called the \\"Pelham Pesthouse\\".Rat Island p.551, New York City Guide, Federal Writers' Project, 1939. The remains of cobblestone walls and foundations are still there. It was abandoned due to storm floods. Local legends say there was also a lighthouse for a while. New York City purchased the island in 1888. It became a mini-colony for writers and artists in the early 20th century. It was bought by Dr. H. A. Parmentier in 1908. He subsequently leased the island to the Mount Vernon Club in 1931. It was owned by a Brooklyn lawyer until 1972 when it was sold to Edmund \\"Red\\" Brennen. He said he bought it to do salvage work and store equipment. For many years crane buckets and lattice booms and other equipment were visible. In March 2009 Brennen put Rat Island up for sale for $300,000. On September 26, 2011, The New York Times published an article about the island, stating the property would go up for auction on October 2, 2011. It was sold at that auction for $160,000 to 71-year-old retired Port Authority worker Alex Schibli, a Swiss resident of nearby City Island. Schibli said he has no immediate plans for physical changes to the island, but is considering renaming it Malina Island after his granddaughter.Bronx man buys ‚ÄòRat Island‚Äô for $160,000, CBS New York via Yahoo News, October 4, 2011, accessed October 5, 2011, retrieved October 5, 2011. In summer months, a couple dozen people may come to the island. In the past, during summer the Parks Department used to put waste drums so they may contain their garbage. Sometimes, the local first responders use it to practice rescue missions with boats and helicopters. In August 2016, a polyester copy of the statue of the Swiss freedom fighter William Tell was erected on the island for the 725th Swiss National Day. The original is located in Altdorf, Uri, Switzerland. In March 2017, Schibli was sued unsuccessfully in a People's Court episode for fees charged by an engineer whom he asked to give an estimate on what was needed to put a more permanent statue of William Tell on the island.People's Court S20, Ep99, March 16, 2017 Name It is not known how the island received its name. It has been proposed by Red Brennan and others including former prison workers that prisoners escaping from Hart Island nearby, nicknamed \\"rats\\", used the small island to rest before swimming on to City Island and freedom. Another theory is that when the island housed typhoid victims in the 19th century it presumably attracted vermin.Rat Island gets new owner, might get new name According to Schibli, the island's original name was \\"Rattle Island,\\" because rattling noisemakers were used to ward off ships.

Haggerty and Bonnie Zimmerman (eds), Gay Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia, Volume 2. New York: Garland Publishing, 2000. Based in New York City, Ligon engages in intertextuality with other works from the visual arts, literature, and history, as well as his own life. He is noted as one of the originators of the term Post-Blackness.  Early life and career  Ligon was born in 1960 in the Forest Houses Projects in the south Bronx. When he was seven, his divorced, working-class parents were able to get scholarships for him and his younger brother to attend Walden School, a high-quality, progressive, private school on Manhattan's Upper West Side.Hunter Drohojowska-Philp (December 11, 2009), \\"Glenn Ligon gets Obama's vote\\", Los Angeles Times. Ligon graduated from Wesleyan University with a B.A. in 1982. After graduating, he worked as a proofreader for a law firm, while in his spare time he painted, working in the abstract Expressionist style of Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock. In 1985, he participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Program.Glenn Ligon, Luhring Augustine Gallery, New York.

Work  Ligon works in multiple media, including painting, neon, video, photography, and digital media such as Adobe Flash for his work Annotations. Ligon's work is greatly informed by his experiences as an African American and as a gay manCarol Vogel (February 24, 2011), \\"The Inside Story on Outsiderness\\", The New York Times. living in the United States. = Painting = Although Ligon's work spans sculptures, prints, drawings, mixed media and neon signs, painting remains a core activity. Highly influenced by wide reading, he has incorporated texts into his paintings, in the form of literary fragments, jokes, and evocative quotes from a selection of authors, which he stencils directly onto the canvas by hand.Glenn Ligon, Stranger #44 (2011), Artists for Haiti, September 22, 2011, Christie's New York. His source materials concern issues of the lives of black Americans throughout history, often alluding to other prominent black figures. In 1989, he mounted his first solo show, \\"How It Feels to Be Colored Me,\\" in Brooklyn. This show established Ligon's reputation for creating large, text-based paintings in which a phrase chosen from literature or other sources is repeated continuously, eventually dissipating into murk. Untitled (I Am a Man) (1988), a reinterpretation of the signs carried during the Memphis Sanitation Strike in 1968 ‚Äî made famous by Ernest Withers's photographs of the march, is the first example of his use of text.Carol Vogel (November 15, 2012), \\"National Gallery of Art Acquires Glenn Ligon Painting\\", The New York Times, November 16, 2012. In several other paintings, he overlaps repeating text to a point of illegibility, demanding the viewer‚Äôs attention as they try to make out the obscured words. Ligon‚Äôs Prologue Series #2 (1991) includes the opening text of Ralph Ellison‚Äôs Invisible Man, stenciled in various shades of black and grey, the words becoming less discernible as they progress towards the bottom of the composition. He uses this same passage of text in Prologue Series #5 (1991), but obscures the words further, creating a further sense of abstraction and ambiguity about the subject. Ligon gained prominence in the early 1990s, along with a generation of artists including Janine Antoni, Ren√©e Green, Marlon Riggs, Gary Simmons, and Lorna Simpson. In 1993, Ligon began the first of three series of gold-colored paintings based on Richard Pryor's groundbreaking stand-up comedy routines from the 1970s. The scatological and racially charged jokes which Ligon depicts are expressed in the vernacular language of the street and reveal a complex vision of black culture.Glenn Ligon, October 27 ‚Äì December 8, 2007 Regen Projects, Los Angeles. In 1993, Ligon's show To Disembark was released. This show commented on the linkage between slavery of the past and the time's racial injustices. Ligon was inspired by historical moments throughout slavery, and was specifically inspired by the story of Henry \\"Box\\" Brown. Brown was a slave who literally shipped himself from Virginia to freedom in Philadelphia via a box crate. Much of To Disembark centers around the crates that Ligon has constructed and are dispersed throughout the gallery. Ligon also took note of how Brown was allegedly singing when he arrived in Philadelphia. To incorporate this element, Ligon placed speakers inside the crates quietly playing songs such as \\"Strange Fruit\\" sung by Billie Holiday and \\"Sound of da Police\\" by KRS-one. The juxtaposition of these two songs, one released in the early 1900s and the other the early 2000s, is a comment on although many years have passed, but the struggle is still present. \\"Strange Fruit\\" has been used by other black artists such as Hank Willis Thomas in his photography series of the same name. In Notes on the Margin of the Black Book (1991-1993), Ligon reacts to Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs of black male bodies from his 1996 book titled, Black Book. Ligon separately framed 91 erotic photographs of black males cut from Robert Mapplethorpe's 1988 Black Book, installing them in two horizontal rows. Between them are two more rows of small framed typed texts, 78 comments on sexuality, race, AIDS, art and the controversy over Mapplethorpe's work that was launched by then-Texas Congressman Dick Armey.Christopher Knight (October 24, 2011), Art review: 'Glenn Ligon: America' at LACMA Los Angeles Times. Ligon explicitly points out the problematics of these visuals in Mapplethorpe's book with his row of textual placards between the rows of photographs. These images, because they were first published in Mapplethorpe's book, had a limited the scope under which they were viewed. Ligon, however, made these pictures public literally in how they were present, in a museum, but also through how they were viewed. Ligon forced viewers to look at these images in a room full of others. This brings forward the uncomfortability of viewing such images publicly, and allows for open discussion of them. It was this show that quickly led Ligon into Feast of Scraps. In A Feast of Scraps (1994‚Äì98), he inserted pornographic and stereotypical photographs of black men, complete with invented captions (\\"mother knew,\\" \\"I fell out\\" \\"It's a process\\") into albums of family snapshots including graduation photographs, vacation snapshots, pictures of baby showers, birthday celebrations, and baptisms. Some of the latter photos include the artist's own family. Ligon uses this sort of imagery to subvert the stereotype of the black American family, as well as express part of his own sexuality. In this sense, photography is used as a way of representing multiple identities through the disruption of images, which expresses the fragmentation of black identity, specifically the artist‚Äôs own identity. Ligon acknowledges that sexuality is something that is not necessarily visible, so it can be erased in photographs such as photos from his teenage years. The imagery causes the viewer to imagine the identity and narrative of those depicted in these photographs, as well as recognize their own internalized perceptions of the black American family. This project draws from the secret histories and submerged meanings of inherited texts and images. Another series of large paintings was based on children's coloring and additions to drawings of iconic figures in 1970s black-history coloring books. = Installation art = In 1994, Ligon's art installation To Disembark was shown at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. The title alludes to the title of a book of poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks. To Disembark functions in both works to evoke the recognition that African Americans are still coping with the remnants of slavery and its manifestation in racism.Kimberly Connor. Imagining Grace: Liberating Theologies in the Slave Narrative Tradition. University of Illinois Press, 2000. In one part of the installation, Ligon created a series of packing crates modeled on the one described by ex-slave Henry \\"Box\\" Brown in his Narrative of Henry Box Brown who escaped from Slavery Enclosed in a Box 3 Feet Long and 2 Wide. Each crate played a different sound, such as a heartbeat, a spiritual, or contemporary rap music. Around each box, the artist placed posters in which he characterized himself, in words and period images, as a runaway slave in the style of 19th-century broadsheets circulated to advertise for the return of fugitive slaves. In another part of the exhibition, Ligon stenciled four quotes from a 1928 Zora Neale Hurston essay, \\"How It Feels To Be Colored Me\\", directly on the walls: \\"I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background,\\" \\"I remember the very day that I became colored,\\" \\"I am not tragically colored,\\" and \\"I do not always feel colored.\\" Ligon found Hurston's writing illuminating because she explores the idea of race as a concept that is structured by context rather than essence. = Neon works = Since 2005, Ligon has made neon works. Warm Broad Glow (2005), Ligon's first exploration in neon, uses a fragment of text from Three Lives, the 1909 novel by American author Gertrude Stein. Ligon rendered the words \\"negro sunshine\\" in warm white neon, the letters of which were then painted black on the front.Glenn Ligon: Neon, October 26 - December 8, 2012 Luhring Augustine Gallery, New York. In 2008, the piece was selected to participate in the Renaissance Society's group exhibit, Black Is, Black Ain't.The Renaissance Society It was installed on the Whitney Museum's facade in 2011.Carol Vogel (October 26, 2012), \\"New School's New Neon\\", The New York Times. Other neon works are derived from neon sculptures by Bruce Nauman. One Live and Die (2006) stems from Nauman's 100 Live and Die (1984), for example. Ligon's large-scale installation A Small Band consists of three neon pieces illuminating the words \\"blues,\\" \\"blood,\\" and \\"bruise.\\" Commissioned for the facade of the Central Pavilion at the fifty-sixth Venice Biennale, the work has been subsequently arranged in a new, site-specific formations at the Stony Island Arts Bank in Chicago, Illinois, the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia. The three words of A Small Band reference composer Steve Reich's 1966 sound piece Come Out, which looped a fragment of the recorded testimony of Daniel Hamm, who was one of the Harlem Six, a group of young black men wrongly accused and convicted of murder in the mid-1960s. = Film = In 2009, Ligon completed a short film entitled \\"The Death of Tom.\\" It is based on Thomas Edison's 1903 silent film Uncle Tom's Cabin. Playing the character of Tom, Ligon had himself filmed re-creating the last scene of Edison's movie, from which he took his title. But the film was incorrectly loaded in the hand-crank camera that the artist used, so no imagery appeared on film. Embracing this apparent failure, Ligon decided to show his film as an abstract progression of lights and darks with a narrative suggested by the score composed and played by jazz musician Jason Moran.  Exhibitions  Ligon's work has been the subject of exhibitions throughout the United States and Europe. Solo exhibitions in the early 21st century include at the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2001); the Kunstverein M√ºnchen, Germany (2001), the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (2000); the St. Louis Art Museum (2000); the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia (1998); and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1996).Glenn Ligon: Off Book, December 12, 2009 ‚Äì January 23, 2010 Regen Projects, Los Angeles. A first survey of Ligon's work opened at The Power Plant in Toronto in June 2005 and traveled to the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh; Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston; Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus; Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in Vancouver, and the Mudam in Luxembourg. The first comprehensive mid-career retrospective devoted to Ligon's work, was organized in 2011 by Scott Rothkopf at the Whitney Museum of American Art and travelled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.Whitney Museum of American Art. Group shows in which Ligon has participated include the Whitney Biennial (1991 and 1993), Biennale of Sydney (1996), Venice Biennale (1997), Kwangju Biennale (2000), and documenta 11 (2002). In 2013, Ligon started writing letters to artists whose work had made an impression on him in his life, asking if he could borrow that particular work for an exhibition. While some of the letters were sent to living artists, others are letters that Ligon would have sent to those of the past,Florence Waters (April 7, 2015), Encounters and Collisions: Glenn Ligon looks back on history in his latest, exploratory exhibition Wallpaper. including Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Felix Gonzalez-Torres.Glenn Ligon: Encounters and Collisions, April 3 - June 14, 2015 Nottingham Contemporary. The resulting show at Nottingham Contemporary in 2015 featured work by 45 different artists from Warhol to Steve McQueen, as well as Black Panther Party posters, press shots and footage from the Birmingham riot of 1963. Ligon also curated the 2017 exhibition Blue Black at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation, which was inspired by the museum's permanent, site-specific sculpture of the same name by Ellsworth Kelly. Featuring nearly sixty works, including several of Ligon's, the exhibition explored the appearance of blue and black in twentieth- and twenty-first- century art. According to critic Holland Cotter, the effect of Blue Black was \\"a show that isn't reductively 'racial' but includes race on a spectrum of meanings that runs from polemical to personal and poetic.\\"  Collections  Ligon's work is represented in many public collections, including the Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Tate Modern, London; the Minneapolis Institute of Art; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; the Blanton Museum of Art, Austin; the Saint Louis Art Museum; the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford; the Warwick Arts Centre, Coventry; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. In 2012, the National Gallery of Art in Washington bought the painting Untitled (I Am a Man) (1988).Carol Vogel (November 15, 2012), \\"National Gallery of Art Acquires Glenn Ligon Painting\\", The New York Times. In 2012, Ligon was commissioned to create the first site-specific artwork for the New School's University Center building, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, on the corner of 14th Street and Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. The work features about 400 feet of text from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass rendered in violet neon light, running around the top of a wall in the center's first-floor caf√©.

Recognition  In 2005, Ligon won an Alphonse Fletcher Foundation Fellowship for his art work. In 2006 he was awarded the Skowhegan Medal for Painting. In 2010, he won a United States Artists Fellow award.United States Artists Official Website In 2009, President Barack Obama added Ligon's 1992 Black Like Me No. 2, on loan from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, to the White House collection, where it was installed in the President's private living quarters. The text in the selected painting is from John Howard Griffin's 1961 memoir Black Like Me, the account of a white man's experiences traveling through the South after he had his skin artificially darkened. The words \\"All traces of the Griffin I had been were wiped from existence\\" are repeated in capital letters that progressively overlap until they coalesce as a field of black paint. Art critic Jerry Saltz called this work a \\"black-and- white beauty.\\" At the annual Gala in the Garden at the Hammer Museum in 2018, he was honored by attorney and social justice advocate Bryan Stevenson.Makeda Easter (October 15, 2018), Hammer Gala raises $2.6 million, honors Margaret Atwood and Glenn Ligon for their socially engaged works Los Angeles Times.

It was directed and edited by Chris Bran of the Vapour Brothers. It was released on DVD on 1 December 2004. The DVD release contains all four episodes of the original broadcast from Radiohead Television, an online television station, featuring unheard songs from the band, live studio performances, as well as interviews. The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time is named after a collage by German artist John Heartfield. Background Episodes of The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time were originally developed to be a programme on a regular television channel, or even on Radiohead's own channel. \\"This was originally meant to be four episodes shown on our very own television channel,‚Äù Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke explained on the band's website. Instead, the group went on to create an internet TV channel Radiohead Television in conjunction with the release of their 2003 album Hail to the Thief. Along with the episodes for The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time, other clips including promotional videos, webcast footage from live performances, as well as webcast footage from the studio were broadcast. On 10 May 2003, a two-minute trailer went live with the promotional video for Radiohead's single \\"There There\\". The site fully launched on 26 May with a 30-minute show. All four episodes were shown on Radiohead Television, where they could be watched for free in QuickTime format. Programming started on the hour, with visitors who did not get to the site on time faced with a test card and 1970s-style intermission music. After running for several months this website was replaced with an advertisement for the DVD. Release The DVD cover features original artwork by long-time collaborators Stanley Donwood and Thom Yorke, under the alias \\"Dr. Tchock\\", plus sleeve notes written by Yorke. Several of the short films were shown as interval entertainment at Jonny Greenwood's performances at the 2005 Ether Festival. The DVD was self-released, as Radiohead's contract with record label EMI (Parlophone/Capitol) was fulfilled after COM LAG (2plus2isfive). It was initially available to order through the band's website. In January 2020, Radiohead released it free on their website. Episodes Some of the sections of The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time were created by Chris Bran, Stanley Donwood and Radiohead, while others were directed by fans who submitted videos that were selected for inclusion by the band.

He was the President of Bangladesh from 15 August to 6 November 1975, after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Background Ahmad completed his BL degree at the University of Dhaka and entered politics in 1942. He was one of the founder joint secretaries of the East Bengal Awami Muslim League. Political career Ahmad was elected a member of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly in 1954 as a candidate of the United Front. After the central government of Pakistan dissolved the United Front, Ahmad was jailed in 1954 along with other Bengali leaders. He was released in 1955 and elected the chief whip of the United Front parliamentary party. In 1958, with the promulgation of martial law, he was arrested by the regime of Ayub Khan. During the 6 Point Movement, Ahmad was again jailed in 1966. Following his release, Ahmad accompanied Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (then the most senior leader of the Awami League) to the all-parties conference called by Ayub Khan in Rawalpindi in 1969. In 1970 he was elected a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan. =Government of Bangladesh in exile= At the onset of the Bangladesh War of Independence and Mujib's arrest, Ahmad and other Awami League leaders gathered in Meherpur to form the Government of Bangladesh in exile. Syed Nazrul Islam served as the acting President while Mujib was declared President, Tajuddin Ahmad was appointed Prime Minister and Ahmad was made the Foreign Minister. In this capacity, Ahmad was to build international support for the cause of Bangladesh's independence. But his role as the Foreign Minister became controversial as he wanted a peaceful solution, remaining within Pakistan in line with the Six Point Charter of his leader Sheikh Mujib. Zafrullah Chowdhury alleges that Ahmad did not act alone in this regard and that Awami League leaders were involved. After the liberation, Ahmad was appointed the Minister of Power, Irrigation and Flood Control in 1972 as part of the Second Sheikh Mujib cabinet. In 1973, he took charge of the Ministry of Commerce in the Third Sheikh Mujib cabinet. He was a member of the executive committee of Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL) which was formed in 1975. President of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujib and all members of his family, except his daughters, who were in West Germany at the time, were assassinated by a group of army personnel on 15 August. Ahmad immediately took control of the government, proclaiming himself President. Major General Ziaur Rahman was appointed as Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army, replacing K M Shafiullah. He praised the killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman calling them Shurjo Shontan (sons of the sun). Ahmad also ordered the imprisonment of leaders Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmad, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman and Muhammad Mansur Ali. He replaced the national slogan of Joy Bangla with Bangladesh Zindabad slogan and changed the name Bangladesh Betar to 'Radio Bangladesh'. He proclaimed the Indemnity Ordinance, which granted immunity from prosecution to the assassins of Mujib. Mujib's daughters Sheikh Hasina Wazed and Sheikh Rehana were barred from returning to Bangladesh from abroad. BAKSAL and pro-Mujib political groups were dissolved. On 3 November, in what became infamously known as the \\"Jail Killing Day\\", the four imprisoned leaders Tajuddin Ahmad, Syed Nazrul Islam, A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman, and Muhammad Mansur Ali, who had refused to co-operate with Mostaq, were killed inside Dhaka Central Jail by a group of army officers on the instruction of President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. However, Ahmad was ousted from power on 6 November following a coup on 3 November led by Khaled Mosharraf and Shafat Jamil among others. Later life and legacy Ahmad was imprisoned by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf and later by the Ziaur Rahman administration until 1978. Upon his release, he formed Democratic League and attempted to resuscitate his political career, but to no avail. He spent his last years in Dhaka and died on 5 March 1996. Ahmad was named in the investigation of the murder of Sheikh Mujib launched in 1996 by his daughter Sheikh Hasina, who had just won the national elections to become Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Hasina blamed Ahmad for her father's death. Due to his death, he was not charged or tried. Historians and critics assert that Ahmad was one of the key plotters of Mujib's murder. He has been criticized by Bangladeshi liberal public for legitimizing political murders by protecting Mujib's killers.

Description  Measurements: * Length: 3.5-4.3 in (9-11 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.4 oz (9-11 g) * Wingspan: 19.7 cm (7.75 in) It ranges from southern British Columbia south through various discontinuous parts of the western U.S. (northwest U.S., Sierra Nevada range, southern Rockies, etc.), to central Mexico. It is usually found in pines (especially ponderosa pines), Douglas-firs, and other conifers. Pygmy nuthatches clamber acrobatically in the foliage of these trees, feeding on insects and seeds; less often they creep along limbs or the trunk like bigger nuthatches. Pygmy nuthatches nest in cavities in dead stubs of conifers, lining the bottom of the cavity with pine-cone scales, plant down, and other soft plant and animal materials. They may fill cracks or crevices around the entrance with fur; the function of this behavior is unknown. The female lays 4-9 eggs, which are white with fine reddish-brown spotting. She does most of the incubation, which lasts about 16 days. The young leave the nest about 22 days after hatching. This species is highly gregarious. A nesting pair may have other birds as helpers. Outside the breeding season, this bird wanders in noisy flocks. It also roosts communally; over 100 birds have been seen huddled in a single tree cavity. At a feeder All plumages are similar, with a warm gray cap, blue-gray upper-parts, and whitish underparts. The only feature not seen in the photograph is a whitish spot on the nape, particularly in worn plumage (summer). Vocalizations are highly varied chirps, peeps, and chattering. This species is very similar to the brown-headed nuthatch of the southeastern U.S. Their ranges have no overlap. The pygmy nuthatch features prominently in the climax of the 2000 film Charlie's Angels, in which Cameron Diaz's character, Natalie, discovers the location of the villains' fortress by identifying the call of the pygmy nuthatch, which she says only live in Carmel, California‚Äîthough the bird shown is not a pygmy nuthatch, which in any case is found in a much wider range.

El Bols√≥n is a town in the southwest of R√≠o Negro Province, Argentina, at the foot of the Piltriquitron Mountain. Due to a series of valleys through the mountains of Chile to the Pacific Ocean, El Bols√≥n has an unusually mild climate for its southern location. El Bols√≥n area's first non-indigenous inhabitants were Chilean farmers Lucas C√°rdenas and Elcira Estrada, a couple who came in 1885 from San Pablo, near Osorno, and established themselves in the then known as \\"Valle Nuevo\\" (New Valley); in 2018 El Bols√≥n inaugurated the new Public Clock Square after the couple's names. In the 1970s hippies from Buenos Aires migrated to El Bols√≥n; some of them practised horticulture and made handcrafts. El Bols√≥n has a tourism economy based on an outdoor artisan market, fly fishing, trekking, rafting, climbing, and other outdoor activities in the surrounding lakes and mountains. The nature tourism offers are complemented with the production of cheeses, smoked trout, special brew beer, regional chocolates and ice cream, as well as organic and wild-crafted jams and preserves, particularly elderberries. Communication El Bols√≥n is located approximately 120 km south of the major city of San Carlos de Bariloche and is served by El Bols√≥n Airport. Climate El Bols√≥n has a cool Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csb) owing to its rain shadow location. Winters are the coldest time of year with a July mean of with nighttime temperatures regularly falling below . During cold waves, temperatures can occasionally fall below . During the winter months, precipitation is abundant (mostly rainfall and occasionally snowfalls), resulting in most days being overcast, averaging 15‚Äì17 overcast days per month from May to August. Spring and fall are transition seasons featuring warmer temperatures than in winter. Summers are warmer and sunnier with temperatures during the day averaging in January and comparatively high diurnal ranges, with lows averaging . Frosts can even occur during the summer months. Owing to its location in a valley, wind speeds are lower ranging from a low of in May and June to a high of in January.  History  There have been many different inhabitants in the Bols√≥n region. However, the first settlers of the region were the tsonek. By custom they were hunters/gatherers and seasonally nomadic. It was normal for them to stay in the more sheltered regions of the forests and lakes during the winter and to hunt Guanaco more intensely during the summer and warm autumns. Very little is known about them before the sixteenth century, but through the process of Araucanization they were strongly influenced by the Mapuches. They were the most solid and cohesive culture around and were gaining ground toward eastern Patagonia, through both peaceful means and expansionist wars. This town was not founded by any conqueror, Adelantado , explorer, or discoverer. This region simply served as a place of passage for the migrations of tsonek communities, transhumant looking for game, and gatherers for a long time. Afterwards, it was purely Mapuche territory. Later, with the first inroads of the Europeans in the region, it also provided temporary shelter to those who were carrying cattle and herdsmen crossing the cordillera in an east-west direction, and vice versa, from one sea coast to another. This, as well as Argentina's expansion into the region, resulted in frequent conflicts and disagreements with The Mapuche people. The founding date of El Bolson is considered to be January 28, 1926. That day locals gathered at the home of Candido Azcona, resolving to create the first politically administrative organization in the region, and signing the charter, Commission for the Promotion of El Bolson . The elected members were: President Pedro Pascual Ponce: an Argentine born in the Province of San Luis. He was a teacher, informant ad honorem of the Ministry of Agriculture, rattle raiser, and took part in the Statistics and Census of the Nation of Argentina; Vice President Candido Azcona: a Spaniard from Basque Country, a farmer, and a merchant; Secretary Antonio Merino Rubio: a Spaniard from Malaga, a merchant, and a farmer; Treasurer Jos√© Ulieldin: a Lebanese merchant; pro-treasurer Miguel Anden: also a Lebanese merchant.

It can be aided with a reading of a Bible passage, aleatory opened or not, or even without any scriptural reference. Impromptu preaching was practiced by the Christian apostles. The Bible says that the Holy Spirit gives disciples the inspiration to speak: Matthew 10:16-20 :16: Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. :17: But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; :18: And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. :19: But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. :20: For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. According to some people, when Jesus says \\"take no thought how or what ye shall speak\\" he is saying that it is better not to script your speeches or sermons, but to let the Holy Spirit of your Father speak through you. Others see the expression as simply a comforting exhortation not to worry or be anxious, but to rest confident that God is in control (cf. Phil. 2:12-13). In other places the apostle Paul emphatically underscored the importance of diligent work in study and preparation (I Tim. 4:13-16; II Tim. 2:15). Today impromptu preaching is practiced by unprogrammed Quakers, Mennonites and some Pentecostals.

In 1978, WVSOM graduated its first class of 33 students. Extensive renovations started in 1992 and continue into the present time, with construction just completed on a new building that includes exam rooms and laboratory space. WVSOM has spent more than $38 million on construction and renovation projects while increasing from one building in 1974 to 12 campus facilities across its more than campus, all of this was accomplished while maintaining a debt free financial status. On August 15, 2016, State Senator Craig Blair proposed privatizing the institution. Blair stated that the institution was diverting money from other functions and could thrive as a private institution freed from state bureaucratic regulations.  Academics  WVSOM was founded on the principles of osteopathic medicine, a branch of medicine founded by frontiersman Andrew Taylor Still in the mid-to-late 19th century. The basic premise of osteopathic medicine is that a physician's primary role is to facilitate the body's inherent ability to heal itself. While originally designed as an improvement on the traditional medicine of 19th century America, osteopathic medicine became a reformation within the U.S. healthcare system while remaining distinct from other forms of medicine. In addition to a medical education, students at WVSOM also learn holistic techniques and are trained in Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM), manual-based therapies used to relieve pain, restore range of motion and foster the body's own ability to heal itself. Medical school at WVSOM is a four-year program, with two years of training located at the Lewisburg-based campus and the final two years taking place off-campus during clinical rotations.  Demographics  WVSOM's current enrollment stands at 778 students, with out-of-state students composing the majority (557 out of state :221 in state). The median age is 27, and there are students from 46 states currently attending WVSOM. The male female ratio is roughly equal with 384 females and 408 males. WVSOM maintains a diverse ethnic community on campus, with 161 minority students. AACOMAS reports that 5,298 students applied for admission into WVSOM's most recent class (Class of 2020).

As the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh, he led the wartime provisional government during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Tajuddin is regarded as one of the most influential and instrumental figures in the birth of Bangladesh, due to his leadership of the provisional government in 1971, in which he united the various political, military and cultural forces of Bengali nationalism. Tajuddin was among the first generation of Dhaka-based leading pro-democracy, secular activists in Pakistan. As a member of the short-lived Jubo League, he actively participated in the Language Movement in 1952. As a close confidante, he assisted Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in revitalizing Awami League into a secular political party, during the late 1960s. As General Secretary of Awami League, he coordinated the party during the tumultuous time of late 1960s and early 1970s. Inspired by some early sources, he formulated the early draft of the historic six- points that would eventually lead to the birth of Bangladesh. Tajuddin coordinated Awami League's election campaign for the 1970 Pakistani general election, in which the League gained a historic parliamentary majority to form a government. Tajuddin, along with Mujib and Kamal Hossain, led negotiations with President Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for the transfer of power to the elected National Assembly. Early life Tajuddin Ahmad was born on 23 July 1925 at Dardaria village, in Kapasia, Gazipur district in British India (now Bangladesh), to Maulavi Muhammad Yasin Khan and Meherunnesa Khanam. He went to Saint Gregory's High School in Dhaka, from where he matriculated in 1944, securing 12th position in merit. After matriculation, Tajuddin would briefly lose interest in formal education due to his activism, pausing his studies for three years. On his mother's insistence, he resumed his studies and got admitted to Dhaka College. At Dhaka College, he was irregular at classes, again due to his activism. As a result, couldn't appear in the Intermediate of Arts examination from there; instead he took the examination from a private college as an irregular student in 1948 and passed, securing 4th position. He obtained BA with honours in Economics from the University of Dhaka.  Late British India  Tajuddin's formative years were spent in the last days of British India, in Bengal‚ÄîEast Bengal, to be more precise‚Äîhotbed of anti-British activism, battered with famines, communal riots, and other problems. Those anti-British activists were his earliest inspiration to politics. On this backdrop, his political activism started at a very early age, sometimes interrupting his studies. Muslims of Bengal as well as those of present-day Pakistan enthusiastically supported the Pakistan Movement, demanding a separate state for Muslims of India, under Muslim League's lead. He, like the usual Muslim youths of Bengal of his time, eagerly joined the movement, joining Muslim League in 1943. The Pakistan Movement eventually succeeded; India was partitioned in 1947 and Pakistan was born, geographically consisting of two wings, awkwardly thousands of miles apart, with no common land borders: the more enormous West Wing (current Pakistan), adjacent to the western border of India, consisted of four provinces and the smaller East Wing, adjacent to the eastern edge of India, consisted of only one section, namely East Pakistan. On 4 January 1948, Ahmad joined East Pakistan Student League as a founding member. East Pakistan Tajuddin Ahmad at a young age Right from the beginning, tensions were developing between East and West Pakistan over various issues, most notably on the state language question, which would later culminate into a significant movement. East Pakistan was grossly discriminated both economically and culturally. West Pakistan dominated politics, administration, commerce, industry, and education; At the same time, West Pakistani cities, like Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi, became centers of decision making, thrived as centers of trade, commerce, and opportunity, the East Pakistani capital Dhaka was neglected to near obscurity; even major East Pakistani businesses, like jute and tea, were dominated by West Pakistani businesspersons. The East Pakistani population felt betrayed. The complacent Muslim League leadership of East Pakistan, consisting mostly of elites with ties to West Pakistani ruling elites, detached from the mass, was doing very little for them. During his Dhaka University years, in the newly independent Pakistan, Tajuddin, a resident student of Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall, took part in student politics. He was, however, more interested in national politics. At that time, the newly founded, Awami Muslim League (later Awami League), founded in 1949, in Dhaka, was winning popularity among the masses of East Pakistan. He was attracted towards the party's leader Maulana Bhashani, though showed little interest to his party. Instead, he and a few other disillusioned ex-Muslim League fellows were envisioning new political parties; they even drafted two parties: People's Freedom League (Gono Azadi League) and Democratic Youth League, none of them took off. At last, he and his fellows, notably Oli Ahad and Mohammad Toaha, founded Jubo League, in 1951, (not to be confused with the one founded later in 1972, with the same name, in independent Bangladesh) in a meeting that took place on boats on the river Buriganga to avoid police detection. In 1952, the Bengali Language Movement broke out in East Pakistan; on 21 February, police shot fire on protests at various places, killing several of the protesters. Tajuddin, as a Jubo League worker, got involved by organizing protests and other activities. Police would raid Jubo League's office on 21 and 22 February; he barely avoided arrest. He was arrested by police and imprisoned for several months. Despite its critical role in the Language Movement, Jubo League didn't succeed as a mainstream political party for various reasons. Meanwhile, Awami Muslim League emerged as the most promising political party of East Pakistan. Tajuddin joined Awami Muslim League in 1953, his fellow Jubo League comrade Oli Ahad also followed; the same year, he got elected as the General Secretary of the party in Dhaka District. Awami Muslim League participated in the 1954 East Pakistan Provincial Assembly election in coalition with some other parties (called Jukta Front), with their famous joint 21-points election manifesto. Tajuddin, running on the ticket of Jukta Front, got elected from his constituency, defeating the formidable General Secretary of East Pakistan Muslim League, Fakir Abdul Mannan, by an overwhelming proportion of 3 to 1 vote . Jukta Front won a majority in the election. It formed a cabinet, raising hope in East Pakistan, with veteran politician A. K. Fazlul Huq as Chief Minister. Within months, however, the cabinet was abolished on the pretext of the conspiracy of secession by Chief Minister Huq, to East Pakistan's frustration. Tajuddin was arrested following the dismissal of the cabinet. He took the law examination from prison and got a BA degree in Law. After his return from imprisonment, he was elected as the Social Welfare and Cultural Secretary of Awami League in 1955, and eventually rose to Organizing Secretary in 1964. A military junta, led by Ayub Khan, seized power in a coup d'√©tat in 1958, thus beginning a long period of oppressive military rule in Pakistan. Ayub Khan instituted a new constitution, legitimizing his junta rule, in 1962, reformed the election process to his favor, and brutally suppressed democratic activities. Under Ayub's despotic rule, suffering and deprivation of East Pakistan only aggravated. Tajuddin got arrested, in 1958, just after Ayub Khan took over, and was imprisoned for a year. = Six-points and the 1969 uprising = The 1965 India-Pakistan War severely damaged Ayub regime's prestige. Opposition parties sought to exploit the situation by negotiating with the junta for more democratization; they called for a conference in Lahore on 3 February 1966 and invited rising Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in a bid to win Awami League's support. Meanwhile, just before the conference, President Ayub Khan visited Dhaka at the end of January 1966, and invited East Pakistani political leaders, including Sheikh Mujib, in a talk. Mujib wanted to seize the opportunity to put forward a few demands, highlighting East Pakistan's interest, to the President. Prior to the meeting, Tajuddin, close confidante of Mujib by then, put down the demands as a number of specific points on paper, precursor of the historic six-points demand. Sheikh Mujib tried to persuade the other East Pakistani leaders invited to the talk to support him while he presents the demands to the President in the meeting; they, however, found the demands too radical and refused to help, the demands didn't make it to Ayub Khan on that occasion as a result. Sheikh Mujib and Tajuddin attended the Lahore Conference and put forward the revised version of those points as the six-point demand to the committee. In its essence, the six-points called for a new Constitution, ensuring autonomy of provinces on key matters like monetary policy and defense instead of the prevalent absolute central governance. Mujib's Six-Point was received with absolute disappointment by the West Pakistani leaders present there; they viewed it as a radical secessionist proposal and refused to raise it in the meeting. Disheartened, Sheikh Mujib released the demands to the press instead. Six-points was formally published later in March 1966. Promulgated by Awami League, six-point became the voice of the oppressed East Pakistani people, their charter of emancipation, while getting little support in West Pakistan; the military junta as well as West Pakistani political parties viewed six-point as a threat to Pakistan's unity. In the party council of Awami League on 14‚Äì15 March 1966, about a month after the Lahore Conference, Sheikh Mujib was elected the President of Awami League and Tajuddin the General Secretary, thus consolidating support to six-points within the party. The Ayub administration was determined to suppress six- points by any means. Awami League workers, already being brutally oppressed, came under even greater persecution. Tajuddin himself got arrested in 1966 like many other senior Awami League leaders. In 1968, Tajuddin being still in prison, Ayub regime arrested Sheikh Mujib and others, mostly East Pakistani public service and military officials, on charges of high treason in an infamous case. To make matters even worse, one of the accused, Sergeant Zahurul Haq was shot dead in prison custody. That ignited a massive popular uprising in East Pakistan. In the face of overwhelming popular unrest, Ayub regime started to show signs of compromise. On 1 February 1969, Ayub Khan announced a conference with DAC (popularly known as the Round Table Conference or RTC), in Rawalpindi, on 17 February 1969. Meanwhile, opposition parties of both East and West Pakistan united under Democratic Action Committee (DAC), endeavoring to reach a common charter of demands in negotiations with Ayub Khan. Upon request from DAC to join them, Awami League replied that the conference wouldn't gain credibility without their President Mujib, who is still in prison and they won't join the conference without him. DAC requested for Mujib's release to Ayub Khan; Ayub, however, rejected the request citing legal difficulties. A legal battle ensued between Awami League and the government over Mujib's release. In the face of popular pressure the conference was postponed. Tajuddin, just released from imprisonment, joined his two Awami League comrades, lawyers Kamal Hossain and Amir-ul Islam, who were already leading the legal front, in their flight to Rawalpindi on 17 February 1969 in order to negotiate Mujib's release. Despite initial objections, Ayub government eventually conceded and agreed to release Mujib unconditionally so that he can attend the Round Table Conference. At last, Sheikh Mujib, the unanimous leader of East Pakistan, got released from prison on 23 February 1969; a massive crowd welcomed him in a meeting, conferring him the title Bangabandhu. The Round Table Conference between President Yahya Khan and the Democratic Action Committee started on late February, immediately after Mujib's release, and concluded on 13 March. Mujib joined the conference with Tajuddin. In this conference again, Mujib's six-point came under strong opposition from the West Pakistani politicians; they refused to include six- point in the common charter of the DAC; Awami League had to submit it separately as a party demand. On 13 March, on the concluding session, Ayub Khan, approved the federation proposal, however, refused to comment on autonomy of provinces as the six-points demanded, citing it as a matter that only elected legislators can decide, thus postponing it until a general election takes place. West Pakistani leaders rejoiced, however, Sheikh Mujib and Awami League rejected the award. President Ayub Khan resigned shortly after the conference, ending his 11 year rule; his ambitious commander-in- chief of the army, General Yahya Khan, who reportedly had been pulling the strings of the Round Table Conference from behind, took over. Yahya immediately abrogated the 1962 constitution, imposed martial law and promised a general election. = The 1970 general election = Upon assuming power, Yahya Khan promised a general election. The general election was held on 7 December 1970, after years of military rule. Awami League, lead by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a landslide victory, securing 160 out of 300 seats, as a triumph to the six-points. Tajuddin also ran for and got elected from his constituency. Awami League's victory proved to be an outright challenge to West Pakistani dominance, few West Pakistani leaders wanted to see an East Pakistani party lead the central government, besides, they still viewed the six-point as a threat. After the election, in January 1971, Yahya Khan called for a talk with Awami League leadership to decide the future Constitution, seeking potential compromises on the six-points. Tajuddin accompanied Sheikh Mujib, along with fellow senior Awami League Leaders, Syed Nazrul Islam, M Mansur Ali, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, and A H M Qamaruzzaman, in the Mujib-Yahya talk. The Awami League leadership made it clear that the election had been their people's mandate to six-points, constitution must be based on six points, there will be no compromise on this matter. Yahya khan, however, was conspiring otherwise, with the pro-junta West Pakistani opposition party (PPP) leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. March 1971 begun with uncertainty and apprehension in East Pakistan. On 1 March, Yahya Khan whimsically postponed the inaugural session of the National Assembly due two days later, on 3 March, indefinitely as, according to him, \\"it was imperative to give more time to the political leaders to arrive at a reasonable understanding on the issue of Constitution making ...\\". Sheikh Mujib immediately called for non-cooperation to his people, effectively taking control of East Pakistan, issuing directives to people and party workers regularly since then. Non-cooperation was an immediate success; people spontaneously started to defy curfew imposed by the Army. Speculations started to develop on Yahya Khan's next move. On 3 March, Yahya Khan announced that a round table conference will be held in Dhaka on 10 March to settle the disputes on Constitution. On 7 March 1971, however, in a historical speech, in front of a massive gathering, Sheikh Mujib called for an indefinite general strike, asked his people to be prepared for any emergency. On 15 March, Yahya Khan arrived Dhaka and met Mujib the next day. Since then, a series of meetings took place between them, almost everyday, until late March; upon Yahya's insistence, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto joined them from 21 March. Mujib pressed Yahya to withdraw the Martial Law immediately; Yahya refused, claiming legal difficulties with that. Mujib offered his assistants Tajuddin and Kamal Hossain meet Khan's legal experts and sort out the difficulties; Yahya accepted the offer and Kamal Hossain and Tajuddin met his experts accordingly, and made some progress too. During those talks, news of war preparations in East Pakistan were reaching Awami League leadership, troops and arms were being concentrated from West Pakistan. Mujib asked Yahya to stop the reinforcement, warning him about the consequences. Awami League leadership were expecting that on 24 March, final negotiations would take place. On 25 March, however, they came to know that, with discussions unfinished, Yahya's delegation had secretly left Dhaka, killing hope for a peaceful settlement. Bangladesh Liberation War Though Yahya Khan promised to resume talks on 25 March, everybody were apprehending that an armed conflict was imminent. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman kept ordering his workers to escape to safety. Despite repeated insistence, by Tajuddin and others, until 25 March, Mujib himself refused to escape fearing massacre of the innocent by Pakistanis using his escape as pretext. Tajuddin stayed in Dhaka until 25 March 1971, the night Yahya secretly left Dhaka and Pakistan Army cracked down on the Bangladeshi population in Dhaka, killing thousands of people. Mujib got arrested on that very night, leaving a critical leadership void. Just as the entire nation, Awami League leadership was also taken by surprise; they became scattered, each busy finding their own paths to safety, thereby losing contact with each other for few days. On the night of 25 March, Tajuddin and his trusted long- time comrade Barrister Amir-ul Islam left home and went into hiding for the next day. The duo secretly left Dhaka on 27 March for neighbouring India. = Formation of Bangladesh Government in Exile = After a perilous and exhausting journey, through Kushtia and Chuadanga Tajuddin and Amir-ul Islam reached the Indian border. Crossing the border, on 30 March, Tajuddin met the regional head of the Indian border security force (BSF), Golok Majumdar, and found to his dismay that there had been no prior arrangements with the Indian government for any contingency. Even greater disaster was yet to come as from the key cities the Pakistani force would spread around the country, creating a staggering influx of refugees. Contact with the rest of the senior Awami League leadership severed, every moment being precious, he made an immediate fateful decision to travel to Delhi and reach for the Indian government. On 1 April, Tajuddin and Islam, accompanied by Majumdar, left for Delhi aboard a military cargo plane, on a secret flight. Tajuddin's first meeting with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi took place on 4 April. On their second meeting next day, Gandhi informed him that Sheikh Mujib had been arrested and transported to Pakistan though Pakistan didn't make it official yet.. Being asked about the Bangladesh government, he replied, as consulted with Amir-ul Islam the day before, that a provisional government has been formed, with Sheikh Mujib as its President and all senior leaders who attended the Mujib-Yahya talk as cabinet members; moreover, except for Sheikh Mujib's arrest, all other members' whereabouts being unknown until then, Tajuddin presented himself as the Prime Minister of the Government. Two crucial resolutions were reached in that meeting: firstly, India opened its borders for Bangladeshi refugees, thereby saving millions of lives in the upcoming days when Pakistani aggression reached outside major cities; secondly, India allowed the Bangladesh Government to operate within Indian territories. Indian government also promised to help the liberation war of Bangladesh by all possible means. While Tajuddin was in Delhi, part of Awami League leadership, notably the young leaders: Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani, Serajul Alam Khan, Abdur Razzaq, and Tofael Ahmed, all furious against Tajuddin, congregated in Kolkata; they viewed Tajuddin's meeting with the Indian Prime Minister as an outrageous act sidelining them. Upon returning to Kolkata, on 8 April, Tajuddin found out and met the group of leaders, including A H M Qamaruzzaman, and informed them about the Delhi meeting outcomes, including the government . Contention arose among the leadership present there: opinion got divided mainly over Tajuddin's legitimacy as prime minister; among the young leaders, Sheikh Mani even rejected the whole idea of the cabinet outright, claiming that there had been no such instruction from Sheikh Mujib. He rather proposed a Revolutionary Council. Amir-ul Islam explained the inadequacy of Revolutionary Council and a legal government's necessity. After that, at Qamaruzzaman's mediation, most of the leadership present there accepted Tajuddin's proposal. In the face of others' fury, Tajuddin, remained committed to the idea of government-in-exile, believing only a legitimate government can muster the international support necessary for the liberation war. On 10 April, he, accompanied by Amir-ul Islam, boarded an old Dakota plane and set off in search of other cabinet members scattered around the borders. Picking up cabinet members Muhammad Mansur Ali, Abdul Mannan, and Syed Nazrul Islam from various places on the way, on April 11 the entourage arrived in Agartala, where the remaining cabinet member, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad and Colonel M A G Osmani, a retired veteran of the Pakistan army turned Awami League politician, were waiting. The key Awami League leadership, reunited after a while, now pondered over the cabinet agenda. While rest of the senior leadership had already accepted Tajuddin as prime minister, Khondaker Mostaq, however, initially claimed to be the rightful candidate for the Prime Minister's office, he eventually accepted the Foreign Minister's. Among others, in the absence of President Sheikh Mujib, Syed Nazrul Islam served as acting President, Qamarauzzaman was given State Minister's office and Mansur Ali Finance Minister's; Colonel Osmani was declared commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The whole cabinet returned to Kolkata on 13 April set to take oath on 14 April at some place in Chuadanga and form the Bangladesh Government in exile. The initial date and place of oath was cancelled due to security concerns. The oath taking ceremony of the first government of Bangladesh took place on the soil of Bangladesh, at the Baidyanathtala village, along the India-Bangladesh border, in Meherpur District on 17 April 1971. While answering a journalist during the ceremony, Tajuddin named the place Mujibnagar, after Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, capital of Bangladesh until victory. Later the government-in-exile came to be popularly known as the Mujibnagar Government. Mujibnagar was abandoned quickly after the oath ceremony fearing raid by Pakistani forces. Thereafter the government headquarter briefly settled at a house at Ballyganj and then at 8 Theatre Road in Kolkata for the rest of the war months. On 15 April, as a preemptive diplomatic support measure, Tajuddin secretly met Hossain Ali, the then Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan in Kolkata, persuading him to switch allegiance to the Bangladesh government along with his Bengali colleagues on 18 April, just the day after the cabinet takes oath. As promised, Ali along with 70 other employees at the Deputy High Commission swore allegiance to the Bangladesh Government on time, overturning the Pakistan High Commission at 9 Circus Avenue into Bangladesh Mission at Kolkata for good. Under Tajuddin's premiership, many Bengali bureaucrats, diplomats and military officers serving Pakistan defected to the new Government of Bangladesh. The Government soon established a capable civil administration. Amidst occasional pressures from within his party, Tajuddin played the key role in keeping the administration from becoming politicized. = Organizing the Liberation War = As the war broke out, Bengali soldiers serving in various Pakistani battalions revolted spontaneously and put up armed resistance against the Pakistani force all over Bangladesh. Commanders of those battalions met themselves along with Colonel M A G Osmani on 4 April. On that meeting, Bangladesh Forces (BDF) was formed, with Osmani as its commander-in-chief, and provisional command structure and operation plan was adopted until a government is formed. Among Tajuddin Government's top priorities was coordinating those ongoing war efforts. Tajuddin's support was vital for Osmani in maintaining the Bangladesh Army as a professional body out of direct political influence. Despite initial vigor, the BDF's activity faltered within couple of months, mainly due to lack of logistics and manpower. In order to salvage the situation, in mid July (10 to 15) the Sector Commanders of BDF met at a crucial conference at Bangadesh Government Headquarter at Theatre Road in Kolkata. Initially, the Sector Commanders, reportedly instigated by Major Ziaur Rahman, proposed a War Council, consisting of the Sector Commanders, promoting Osmani from commander- in-chief of the forces to the Minister of Defense, leaving the field operations up to the War Council. Among the Sector Commanders, Major Khaled Mosharraf opposed the proposal. Osmani, however, treated the idea as an attempt to sideline him and resigned immediately. At Tajuddin's intervention, Osmani resumed command the next day and the discussion continued. The resolutions reached in the conference provided crucial guidance and set course for the conduct of war in the upcoming months. Tajuddin initiated numerous diplomatic and cultural missions which toured world capitals advocating the Bangladesh cause. He would regularly visit the liberated regions of Bangladesh and inspire the Mukti Bahini and other freedom and raise moral. During this period, Tajuddin encountered some intra party conflict led by Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad who conspired to harm the national struggle for independence through a failed attempt to form a confederacy with Pakistan. Among his great diplomatic achievements were to win international support and recognition of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation by the government of India. Post-independence career After nine months of war, the Pakistani occupation forces in Bangladesh surrendered at Dhaka on 16 December 1971. Tajuddin and his cabinet, returned to Dhaka, now the capital of newly independent Bangladesh, from Kolkata on 22 December 1971. In an address at the Dhaka airport on that day and later at the Dhaka Secretariate on the next day, Tajuddin declared that Bangladesh will be built upon the principles of Socialism, Democracy, and Secularism. On 23 December recognizing the sacrifice of freedom fighters and their tremendous potential in building the newborn nation, Tajuddin government declared that all enlisted and non-enlisted freedom fighters will be inducted into a National Militia. His administration quickly embarked on the immediate task of restoring law and order in the newly independent country. Released from nine months of Pakistani imprisonment, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman returned to Dhaka on 10 January 1972. Tajuddin and Mujib met privately the next day, on 11 January, to decide the future leadership. As was the popular wish, Tajuddin happily agreed to transfer prime minister's office to Mujib. Though Mujib initially proposed a presidential government, however, on Tajuddin's insistence, accepted the parliamentary system. In the reformed cabinet, with Sheikh Mujib as the Prime Minister, Tajuddin was given charge of the ministries of finance and planning. Additionally, he was also appointed member of the committee in charge of drafting the Constitution of Bangladesh. As minister of finance, Tajuddin reserved strong resentment against foreign aid, particularly from the United States. He regarded the World Bank as an instrument of United States' domination. During World Bank President Robert McNamara's visit to Bangladesh, in 1972, his response was cold, their meeting ended without bearing any fruit. According to the 1970 election manifesto spirit, in the first Bangladesh National Budget, in 1972, Tajuddin declared nationalization of industries. That, however, came under strong criticism. One of the major arguments against it was that nationalized industries won't be able to find enough skilled manpower to run them. Tajuddin and his fellow planning commission member Nurul Islam argued that while private enterprises can find manpower within country same must be the case for public enterprises and imposed policies accordingly. In the newly independent country, in the new Awami League and in the new cabinet, Tajuddin increasingly found himself cornered by rival factions. His frustration with government and his party was rising fast; rumors of his desire to resign were circulating. Sensing his frustration, the burgeoning newly-formed political party Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD), desperately in search of a prominent face, approached him. He, however, declined their offer. By September 1974, fully aware that his political future will be uncertain, he was resolved to resign from cabinet after his month-long state tour. However, his intention to resign somehow reached top of the government ahead of that. As a result, within days of his return from the tour, in October, he was ordered to resign by the Prime Minister preemptively, depriving him from the honor of voluntary resignation. At last, on 26 October 1974, Tajuddin resigned from the cabinet. After resignation, Tajuddin remained largely inactive in politics. Tajuddin fell out with Mujib after the creation of the one-party system of BAKSAL. When Mujib assumed the title of President and banned other political parties in 1975, Tajuddin became the odd man out, declining and opposing the formation of a one-party system known as BAKSAL. A rift developed between Mujib and Ahmad. They differed on a number of issues. Mujib declared a general amnesty for many war criminals and collaborators which Ahmad disagreed on . Ahmed wanted to create a militia with freedom fighters but Mujib created one with the members of the Mujib Bahini, it was the Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini . He was against Mujib forming the BAKSAL . On April 1975, members of the government travelled to Mujibnagar to commemorate the anniversary of the forming of Mujibnagar Government. Tajuddin Ahmad was not invited, even though he played a crucial role in the formation of the Mujibnagar Government . Tajuddin remained loyal to Mujib and on July 1975, he having heard rumours of plots against Mujib rushed to warn him . Mujib did not take the threat seriously. Assassination A small detachment of the army killed President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family on 15 August 1975. Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who held office in Sheikh Mujib's cabinet at that time and was complicit in the conspiracy, ascended to presidency immediately and imposed martial law. Following Sheikh Mujib and his family's assassination Tajuddin was immediately placed under house arrest. On 22 August, he was arrested along with fellow Awami League politicians Syed Nazrul Islam, A H M Qamaruzzaman, and Muhammad Mansur Ali and imprisoned at the Dhaka Central Jail. On 3 November, in what became infamously known as the \\"Jail Killing Day\\", Tajuddin along with the other three imprisoned leaders was killed inside the jail by a group of army officers on the instruction of President Mostaq. Family Tajuddin was born in a middle class conservative Muslim family, eldest of nine siblings: three brothers and six sisters. His father was Maulavi Muhammad Yasin Khan and mother Meherunnesa Khanam. He lost his father at his twenty-two and took over the family responsibilities since then. On 26 April 1959, Tajuddin married Syeda Zohra Khatun (d. 20 December 2013), daughter of a professor, his trusted companion in both his family and political life. They had four children, three daughters Sharmin Ahmad (Reepi), Simeen Hussain Rimi, Mahjabin Ahmad (Mimi) and one son Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujib and of Tajuddin following that, Zohra reorganized and led the Awami League from 1975 to 1981. Tajuddin's son Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj was the Minister of State for Home Affairs in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet in 2009. Ahmad's second daughter Simeen Hussain was elected as a Member of Parliament from Awami League in 2012. Legacy On 25 March 2007 a documentary on Tajuddin Ahmad was released, Tajuddin Ahmad: An Unsung Hero (directed by Tanvir Mokammel). Shahid Tajuddin Ahmad Medical College in Gazipur was named after him.Ahmad is the national hero of Bangladesh,according to most Bangladeshi residents or immigrants in the U.S. There has been numerous statues of him in Bangladesh.

Mays taught and mentored many influential activists, including Martin Luther King Jr, Julian Bond, Maynard Jackson, and Donn Clendenon, among others. His rhetoric and intellectual pursuits focused on the spread of nonviolence and civil resistance in the mold of Mahatma Gandhi. The peak of his public influence coincided with his nearly three-decade tenure as the sixth president of Morehouse College, a historically black institution of higher learning, in Atlanta, Georgia. Mays was born in the Jim Crow South on a repurposed cotton plantation to freed sharecroppers. He traveled North to attend Bates College and the University of Chicago from where he began his career in activism as a pastor in Georgia's Shiloh Baptist Church. After a brief career as a professor, he was appointed the founding Dean of the School of Religion at Howard University in 1934 which elevated him to national prominence as a proponent of the New Negro movement. Six years later, Mays was tapped to lead Morehouse out of its financial insecurity. Over his tenure from 1940 to 1967, the college's financial endowment doubled, enrollment quadrupled, and it became academically competitive. By the 1960s, Mays established the college as a feeder school for \\"African-American firsts\\" in the United States. Due to college's small student body, Mays personally mentored many students, most notably King; the two first met in 1944. King was known as Mays' \\"spiritual son\\" and Mays his \\"intellectual father.\\" After King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, Mays gave the benediction. Five years later, upon King's assassination and death, Mays delivered the eulogy where he described King in his \\"No Man is Ahead of His Time\\" speech. Mays stepped down from the Morehouse presidency in 1967 continuing to work as a leader in the African American community through national social tours. He presided over the Atlanta Board of Education from 1969 to 1978, where he initiated the racial desegregation of Atlanta. Mays' contributions to the civil rights movement have had him credited as the \\"movement's intellectual conscience\\" or alternatively the \\"Dean [or Schoolmaster] of the Movement\\". Historian Lawrence Carter described Mays as \\"one of the most significant figures in American history\\".Jelks (2012), p. 292‚Äì98 Memorials include hundreds of streets, buildings, statues, awards, scholarships, grants, and fellowships named in his honor. Numerous efforts have been brought forward to posthumously award Mays the Presidential Medal of Freedom as well as feature him on a U.S. postage stamp. Mays has, since 1995, been entombed on the campus of Morehouse, with his wife, Sadie Gray, after an initial burial in Augusta.  Early life  = Early life and ancestry = Benjamin Elijah Mays was born on August 1, 1894 in Epworth, South Carolina, in the small town of Greenwood, South Carolina, the youngest of eight children.Roper (2012), p. 5 His mother, Louvenia Carter Mays, and father, Hezekiah Mays, were born into slavery on Virginia and South Carolina plantations, respectively.Roper (2012), pp. 5‚Äì6 Both were freed in their later lives with the passage of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Mays' father often hit him, his siblings and Louvenia growing up, expressing anger about how he was treated by his master.Roper (2012), p. 6 The \\"Mays\\" family name was derived from their slaver and owner's name, Henry Hazel Mays; he owned 14 slaves in the same area.Roper (2012), pp. 7, 10 Hezekiah worked as a cotton sharecropper to generate income for his family.Roper (2012), p. 11 Mays was told to be cautious of white people and exhibit black pride whenever possible growing up. Mays' older sister, Susie, began to teach him how to read before his formal schooling commenced, which gave him a year's growth in reading compared to the other students in his primary schools. School officials cited him as \\"destined for greatness.\\"Dumas (2006), p. 33 Growing up, he went by the nickname \\"Bennie\\" and was inspired by Fredrick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, and Thomas E. Miller.Roper (2012), p. 12 The Bible was influential to young Mays because he could see his name (of Biblical origins) mentioned frequently, instilling a feeling of empowerment within.Roper (2012), p. 13 During this time, Benjamin Tillman rose to power in South Carolina which saw to the redoubling of lynching and segregation in Mays' neighborhood.Roper (2012), pp. 17‚Äì18 Throughout his tenure as governor, 18 black men were lynched and dozens were hurt in the 1876 shoot-off.Roper (2012), p. 25 On November 8, 1898, members of the Phoenix Riot‚Äìa white suprematist mob‚Äìrode up on horses to the Mays household, a repurposed cotton plantation. They drew their guns at Mays' father and told him to remove his hat and bow down to them.Roper (2012), p. 15 The event would stay with Mays throughout his life. A year later, white mobs and Ku Klux Klan members searched his house in search of relatives after local newspapers announced that cotton prices had plummeted.Roper (2012), p. 33 = Early education = Mays traveled to Maine to study at Bates College when he was 23.In 1911, he was enrolled at the Brick House School in Epworth, a Baptist-sponsored school.Roper (2012), p. 35 He then transferred to the High School Department of South Carolina State College in Orangeburg. He graduated in 1916, aged 22 as its valedictorian.Roper (2012), pp. 44‚Äì46 In high school, teachers often let Mays instruct parts of the mathematics curriculum to students in exchange for extra credit.Roper (2012), p. 47 He won awards for debate and mathematics.Roper (2012), p. 52 A teacher at the school had told Mays to seek graduate school at the University of Chicago as he thought the school would best nurture Mays' intellect. However, before attending graduate school Mays needed to seek an undergraduate education. His relatives and teachers forced him to attend a Baptist university‚Äìthe Virginia Union University. He grew weary of the violence against blacks in Virginia so he sought the guidance of his academic advisors at Virginia Union.Roper (2012), p. 55 They advised him to look into schools in the North as they were typically seen as more prestigious, challenging, and prominent than those of the South. Four professors at the university had attended Bates College in Lewiston, Maine and urged Mays to apply.Roper (2012), p. 55‚Äì57 However, its exacting standards prohibited him from attending. After a year more in Richmond, Mays elevated his grades to the top of his class and wrote personally to Bates president George Colby Chase. Chase granted him a full financial aid package and boarding upon hearing his story and reviewing his academic background.Roper (2012), p. 59, 60, 62‚Äì64 Virginia Union's president warned him that studies at Bates would be \\"too hard for a colored boy\\" and that he should stay in Virginia.Roper (2012), p. 59 Mays ignored his warnings and enrolled in 1917, aged 23. While at Bates he felt pressure to compete with \\"Yankees at the Yankee level\\" which drove him to dedicate him to his studies.Roper (2012), p. 60 He would write in a diary: \\"Yankee superiority was the gauntlet thrown down. I had to pick it up.\\"Roper (2012), p. 61 Working to midnight weekly and arising at 4 AM, Mays excelled at Greek, mathematics, and speech.Roper (2012), p. 64 Although he would experience little racism in college, upon seeing The Birth of a Nation in a local cinema, the crowd cheered for the white slaver which frightened Mays.Roper (2012), p. 68 In college, he was captain of the debate team, played on the football team and served as the Class Day Speaker. He graduated with departmental honors with a B.A. in 1920. Contrary to popular writing and official college records, Mays never received Phi Beta Kappa; his attendance of a \\"high school school from the South\\" disqualified him.Roper (2012), p. 71 = Marriages = Shortly after graduation, he married his first wife, Ellen Edith Harvin, in August 1920 in Newport News, Virginia.Roper (2012), p. 73 The two met when Mays was still in South Carolina and wrote to each other frequently. She was a home economics teacher at a local college before she died after a brief illness two years after they married at age 28. He met his second wife, Sadie Gray, while working at South Carolina State College. After months of courtship, they married on August 9, 1926. Mays kept private the details of his relationship with his second wife; he burned the majority of letters and correspondence between them.Roper (2012), p. 75  Early academic career  Mays studied at the University of Chicago after receiving his B.A. from Bates; he received a M.A. in 1925 and PhD. in 1935.On January 3, 1921, he then entered the University of Chicago as a graduate student, earning an M.A. in 1925. Early on in his academic career he decided to join Omega Psi Phi, a national fraternity for colored men.Roper (2012), p. 107 This organization was known for pooling resources and information among its members so Mays viewed it with great interest. Mays viewed it as \\"a mountain top from which he could see above and beyond\\". In 1924, upon hearing news that there was to be a fraternity meeting in St. Louis, Missouri, Mays traveled by train. However, his decision to travel first class from Birmingham to St. Louis was indirectly against the Jim Crow laws. The ticket salesman only sold Mays a ticket when he lied about who it was for. While riding to St. Louis, the Pullman warned Mays that he was risking his life by sitting in first class and that he should get off at the next stop. Shortly after, three white men, guns drawn, escorted Mays into a car in the back known as the \\"Jim Crow car\\".Roper (2012), p. 108 He eventually made it to the Omega Psi Phi meeting, where he spoke of his experience. To finance his time in university, Mays worked as a Pullman Porter, a railway assistant.Roper (2012), p. 79 Much of the money he had earned growing up was spent financing his time at Bates, on Christmas Day 1921, Mays held only $45 dollars ($587 in 2018 USD).Roper (2012), p. 80 Mays began labor organizing to increase his wage, which was seen negatively by the Porter managers. Although he legally established a labor group for Pullman Porters, he was fired from his job for \\"attracting too much attention to labor rights.\\" His time at the University of Chicago was marked by segregation. He was asked to sit at the colored area in the dining halls and was only allowed to use certain rooms for reading.Roper (2012), p. 81 Mays tolerated the segregation with the mindset that he was \\"only there to get a degree, to convince another brilliant set of Yankees that he could do their work.\\" Although he was licensed to preach in 1919, he was officially ordained a Baptist minister in 1921. During this time he encountered John Hope, the current president of Morehouse College. Hope spoke to Mays about the lack of \\"a fine education for the colored in Atlanta\\". Mays traveled to Atlanta in 1921 and served as a pastor at the Shiloh Baptist Church until 1923. In March 1925, Mays was award an M.A. in religious studies from the university.Roper (2012), p. 117 Upon receiving his master's degree, he wrote to the pastorate with his intention of resigning to pursue a doctorate in the coming years.Roper (2012), p. 118 However, due to his financial status, he took up a teaching position instructing English at South Carolina State College from 1925 to 1926.Roper (2012), p. 119 Mays left his teaching position after routinely clashing with other faculty over grade inflation and academic standards.Roper (2012), p. 126 From 1928 to 1930, he worked as the national student secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA). A couple of months later, he was asked to serve as the director of Study of Black Churches in the United States by the Institute of Social and Religious Research of New York. In 1932, Mays returned to the University of Chicago with the intent of completing a Ph.D. in line with what was asked by the Institute of Social and Religious Research of New York. After some deliberation between fields of studies he could pursue a doctorate in, he eventually decided to study religion and not mathematics or philosophy. Mays also worked as a student assistant to Dr. Lacey Kirk Williams, pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago and President of the National Baptist Convention. In 1933, he wrote his first book with Joseph Nicholson, The Negro's Church. It was the first sociological study of the black church in the United States and was submitted to the university faculty as his dissertation in 1935.Roper (2012), pp. 150, 156 Historian John Herbert Roper estimates that Mays was one of 20 African Americans so earn a doctorate during that year.Roper (2012), p. 159 = Howard University = Mays worked at Howard University from 1934 to 1940. Shortly after receiving his doctorate, he was called by the presidents of multiple universities to lead their religion departments.Roper (2012), p. 174 Mays chose to accept a position at Howard University in Washington as its dean of religious studies.Roper (2012), p. 175 He was instructed to build up the department and establish a reputation for well-trained ministers. Mays first renovated its library and secured loans from the federal government to expand it.Roper (2012), p. 180 His second objective was to separate the federally-funded portions of Howard University from the new school of religion. At the time, the university was partially funded by the U.S. Department of the Interior which prohibited funding to religious enterprises.Roper (2012), p. 181 After he successfully removed the School of Religion from the auspices of the federal government he was tasked with securing funding from wealthy donors from the North.Roper (2012), p. 182 Mays secured a multi-million dollar package from donors by 1930, and was averaging yearly contributions of $750,000 during the Great Depression. The expanding Department of the Interior under Franklin D. Roosevelt, coupled with Mays' fundraising led to unprecedented growth at the university.Roper (2012), p. 183 Salaries for professors increased, new dorms were built and refurbished, the library Mays had been developing was completed, and new lecture halls were established. In 1938, he published his second book, The Negro's God as Reflected in His Literature. In 1939, he secured a large collection of theology books for his new library which prompted the American Association of Theological Schools to accredit the new School of Religion.Roper (2012), p. 189 During this time Mays developed a reputation for exacting standards and elitism.Roper (2012), p. 182 states: \\"Mays was not afraid to be an elitist, but he preferred the treat of merit, value, and worthiness.\\" He was a vocal opponent of the notion that black men are inherently more violent than their white counterparts in universities.Roper (2012), p. 192 He was a vocal proponent of the New Negro movement and frequently lectured about its foundlings and applications.Roper (2012), p. 193 In January 1940, Mays was secretly approached by, John Hervey Wheeler, a trustee of Morehouse College, to see if he was interested in an upcoming search for the college's next president.Roper (2012), p. 204 Wheeler told Mays that the school had a tough time with getting tuition payments out of the students, growing their endowment, and establishing national prominence.Roper (2012), p. 205 Mays expressed interest in the position but Wheeler cautioned him about the odds of him actually being offered the job. On March 10, 1940, Mays was offered the presidency of Morehouse by its trustees; he moved to Atlanta shortly after. When Mays left Howard University, he was honored with the renaming of the newly constructed home of the divinity school to \\"Benjamin Mays Hall.\\"  Meeting with Gandhi  In 1936‚Äì37, Mays traveled to Mysore, India, where, at the urging of Howard Thurman, a fellow professor at Howard, he spoke at some length with Mahatma Gandhi. The two spoke for an hour and a half about the realities and powers of militant pacifism which he used to shape his civil rights ideology and practice.Roper (2012), pp. 193‚Äì95 Mays asked Gandhi about the influence nonviolence had in his life and what his personal thoughts were on the caste system in India.Roper (2012), p. 195 Gandhi told Mays that there was never an instance where violence was acceptable especially that which was undertaken in retaliation. He was told that \\"one must pay the price for protest, even with one's life\\". In response to the caste system. Gandhi believed that there those with darker skin were not inherently untouchable but labeled it a \\"necessary economic injustice\\".Roper (2012), p. 196  Morehouse College, 1940‚Äì1967  = Early years = Mays as the 6th president of Morehouse College.Mays was offered the presidency on March 10 and inaugurated the sixth president on August 1, 1940.Roper (2012), p. 208 Upon his assumption of the presidency, the school was in severe financial distress. In his first speech to an incoming freshman class in 1940, he said, \\"If Morehouse is to continue to be great; it must continue to produce outstanding personalities.\\"Jelks, Randal Maurice. Benjamin Elijah Mays, Schoolmaster of the Movement : A Biography. Chapel Hill, NC, USA: University of North Carolina Press, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 5 November 2014. Mays set out to improve the training of Morehouse men, increase enrollment, grow its endowment, and collect tuition payments. Many associated with the college referenced him as a \\"builder of men.\\" To improve the training of Morehouse men, Mays set out to advance a new curriculum based on the New Negro movement.Roper (2012), p. 210 He specifically wished to increase the training of black physicians, ministers and lawyers. Although Morehouse College was not a medical, law, or ministry school, it was a feeder institution into them so Mays took the preparation of his students into these schools seriously. = Financial planning = During his first three months nothing was planned to be or currently being constructed on campus. Mays had inherited \\"mountains of uncollected student bills\\" which served as a threat to the liquidity of the college. In 1933, Morehouse was doing so poorly financially that it had allowed Atlanta University to take over its financial direction and budget. He earned a reputation for being a penny-pincher and demanded tuition fees on time, which earned him the nickname \\"Buck Bennie;\\" the student newspaper occasionally ran headlines such as \\"Buck Bennie Rides Again,\\" during the first couple of years of his Morehouse presidency. However, he often helped students pay their bills by offering work or finding it around campus. He would write to the employers of the college's graduates to ask them how the recent grads were doing as a way to measure the Morehouse education. Within two years of his presidency, Mays was so successful that he was able to regain control of Morehouse's finances.Mays, Benjamin E.. Born to Rebel : An Autobiography. Athens, GA, USA: University of Georgia Press, 2003. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 5 November 2014. = Effects of World War II = Soon after primary advancements were made with the college, World War II broke out and many students were drafted for military service. The Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Morehouse approached Mays and requested the school be shut down for the remainder of the war, which prompted Mays to lash out and reject his proposition publicly. Mays counter-proposal was to open the school to younger students who were ineligible to be drafted. He moved to improve the academic quality of the students by lowering admissions rates, and reforming the academic platform. College faculty often were encouraged to befriend students and provided them with guidance in a tumultuous social scene at the time. = Recognition = The introduction to his speech compilation at Morehouse notes him with the following: > In physical stature Mays stood six feet tall, but appeared taller because of > his erect posture--a habit he developed during his youth to walk around with > dignity and pride; he weighted approximately 180 pounds and had a full head > of iron-grey air with a contrasting dark complexion. His distinctive > physical appearance commented his towering intellectual stature. When Mays > walked into a room, eyes were likely to focus in his direction. His mere > physical presence attracted attention. He received an honorary doctorate and the \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" Award from Bates College in 1947 and the University of Chicago in 1949, respectively. Although he was a college president, he was not allowed to vote in the 1950s until he was 52 years old. Pulpit, a magazine focusing on black religious preachers, ranked him among the top 20 preachers in America in 1954. The same year he was one of the \\"Top Ten Most Powerful Negros\\" in the nation according to black magazine, Our World. = Jackie Robinson = In 1966, as president, Mays was invited to sit at an Atlanta Braves baseball game as a guest-of-honor by Jackie Robinson when the sports franchise moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta. Robinson invited Mays because of his efforts to integrate the baseball team in Atlanta. Robinson said of Mays: \\"When we first moved here it was the first team of major league caliber to ever move this far south to play baseball. And of course [Mays] was one of the guys, one of the persons really that made things a lot easier for myself and some of the other black ball players.\\" = Roles in the White House = As president he was in great demand as a public speaker. He met hundreds of national and international leaders and served as a trusted advisor to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter. He was appointed by President Truman to the Mid-Century White House Conference on Children and Youth. When Pope John XXIII died in 1963, President Kennedy sent Mays and his Vice President to represent the United States at the funeral in Rome, Italy. During the Kennedy administration, southern members of the Senate blocked Mays' appointment to the United States Civil Rights Commission by accusing him of being a Communist. Mays denied the charges. His relationship with President Jimmy Carter was marked with \\"warmth\\" and \\"hospitality.\\" Carter visited Mays' home in Atlanta, and Mays in turn campaigned for Carter during his 1976 and 1980 presidential runs. Carter wrote to Mays on a monthly basis during his presidency asking him about \\"humans rights, international affairs, and discrimination.\\" = Final years = Mays wanted to hire more teachers, and to pay those teachers a better salary. To do that, Mays sought to be more strict in the collection of student fees, and wanted to increase Morehouse's endowment from $1,114,000. He more than quadrupled the endowment that he inherited by the end of his 27-year tenure.Roper, John Herbert. Magnificent Mays : A Biography of Benjamin Elijah Mays. Columbia, SC, USA: University of South Carolina Press, 2012. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 5 November 2014. Over Mays' twenty-seven years leading Morehouse, the enrollment increased 169%, from 238 to almost a thousand students and furthered the motivation for graduates to pursue graduate studies.  Connection to Martin Luther King Jr.  Martin Luther King Jr. considered Mays his \\"spiritual father\\". Mays first became associated with Martin Luther King Jr. during his time as a student at Morehouse College. While King was a student from 1944 to 1948 he often went to Morehouse's chapel to hear Mays preach. After the sermons, King would run up to Mays and engage with him about the ideas he presented often following him into his office, hours after the sermon ended. He was also a friend of Martin Luther King Jr.'s father, Martin Luther King Sr. and often participated with him religious organizations in Atlanta. Mays dined at the King's homes every so often and spoke with the young Martin Luther King Jr. about his career prospects and ambitions. His mother, Alberta Williams King said Mays was a \\"great influence on Martin Luther King Jr.,\\" \\"[an] example of what kind of minister Martin could become,\\" and \\"possessor of great moral principles.\\" While King was only his 20s, Mays helped him assume the responsibility of his actions in the civil rights rallies in which he participated. King needed Mays \\"for spiritual support as he faced the burden of being perceived as the personification of black America's hopes and dreams, it was Mays who held the job as King's consigliere over the next fourteen years as the death threats against him grew more ominous and the public battles more dangerous.\\" After King gained national attention as a consequence of his 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, he began to refer to Mays as his \\"spiritual and intellectual mentor\\", which enhanced the friendship they had and prompted Mays to be more involved with King's civil rights endeavors. Mays revered him as his \\"spiritual son\\". Mays gave the benediction at the close of the official program of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where King delivered his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in 1963. = \\"No man is ahead of his time\\" speech = The two developed a close relationship that continued until King's assassination by James Earl Ray on April 4, 1968.\\"King Encyclopedia,\\" http://mlk- kpp01.stanford.edu/kingweb/about_king/encyclopedia/mays_benjamin.htm. King and Mays promised each other that whoever outlived the other would deliver the eulogy at the other's funeral. On April 9, 1968, Mays delivered a eulogy that would later be known as the \\"No Man is Ahead of His Time\\" speech. He noted King's time in history to an estimated 150,000 mourners by stating in his most famous passage: The speech was well received by the attendants of the funeral and the American populate. It was later hailed as \\"a masterpiece of twentieth century oratory.\\" After the death of King, Mays drew controversy when his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church urged an audience of mostly white people, \\"not to dishonor [King's] name by trying to solve our problems through rioting in the streets. If they could turn their sorrow into hope for the future and use their outrage to invigorate a peaceful climb to the mountaintop, Martin Luther King Jr. will have died a redemptive death from which all mankind will benefit.\\"  After Morehouse, 1967‚Äì1981  = Social tours and advocacy = Mays, during his social tours, was honored at the South Carolina State House in 1978. Mays began teaching again, and served as a private advisor to the president of Michigan State University and went on to publish Disturbed About Man, a collection of his sermons at Morehouse College. His publications described his early life in South Carolina and the racial tensions he had to overcome. During this time he began to give speeches and commencement addresses at various intuitions to spread both religious and racial tolerance. He ended his social tours in the early 1980s, giving a total of 250 commencement addresses at colleges, universities, and schools. In 1978, the U.S. Department of Education granted him the Distinguished Educator Award and the South Carolina State House hung a commissioned portrait of him in its chamber. These awards from South Carolina were deeply appreciated by Mays as he left the state in fear of his life and this he loved. During the social transformation of the South in the 1970s, Mays' legacy in his birthplace was solidified and he took on the title of \\"native son\\". = Atlanta board presidency = At age seventy-five, Mays was elected president of the Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education, where he supervised the peaceful desegregation of Atlanta's public schools as a consequence of the 1970 federal court order. Members of the board argued that since the bussing was not a part of their system they did not have to create one for desegregation; however, the idea was shot down by Mays, who cited the Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education Supreme Court decision. It was during this time that Mays ordered the city to create bus routes to cater to African-American neighborhoods. The board did not support the decision and asked the Georgia's Attorney General, Arthur K. Bolton, for a review of the case. Bolton brought the city government together with the board and with Mays created what was known as the Atlanta Compromise Plan. His \\"commanding and demanding personality\\" was largely credited for the exponential levels of desegregation in Atlanta. The Atlanta Compromise Plan prompted Mays to advocate for the administration of the plan to be \\"colorless\\", that is to say, black and white students were transported on the same routes, in the same buses. This was named the \\"Majority to Minority\\" volunteer plan, better known as the \\"M to M\\" plan. The plan also allowed each student whose race was in the minority to transfer to a school that had the majority race; this was advantageous to the black populace of Atlanta. The program was later known as the \\"Volunteer Transfer Program\\" or VTP, and was ministered by the federal courts and the board. On July 28, 1974, Mays signed the alignment order declaring that the Atlanta School System was unitary. On July 1, 1973, Mays appointed Alonzo Crim as the first African-American superintendent of schools, which was met with backlash from the other board members and city officials. He used his power and influence in Atlanta to shield Crim from the criticism and allowed him the opportunity to run the school system. During the later part of his tenure he greatly expanded the jurisdiction of the board, and upon his retirement in 1981 Mays was honored by the naming of a street. Near the end of his tenure, the board voted to name a newly constructed school after Mays; Mays High School was constructed on February 10, 1985, and was open to students of all races. He retired from the board in 1981. The Atlanta Board of Education had a rule against naming buildings after people unless they had been deceased for two years; they waived it for Mays; he visited the school frequently when it was being built. He is widely credited as the most influential figure in the desegregation of Atlanta, Georgia.  Death and legacy  A statue of Mays sits feet away from his memorial on the grounds of Morehouse College. Benjamin Mays died on March 28, 1984 in Atlanta, Georgia. He was initially buried at South-View Cemetery, but in May 1995 his body was entombed on the campus of Morehouse College along with his wife Sadie. Morehouse College established the Benjamin E. Mays Scholarship shortly after his death. Boston University professor Lawrence Carter described Mays as \\"one of the most significant figures in American history.\\" Andrew Young said of Mays: \\"if there hadn't a Benjamin Mays there would not have been a Martin Luther King Jr. He was very much a product of Dr. Mays religious thinking.\\" He was known to Dillard University president Samuel DuBois Cook as \\"[one of the] great architects of the civil rights movement. Not only in training individuals but in writing his books, leadership in churches, as a pastor, college president. He set the standard. And he was uncompromising.\\" In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Benjamin Mays on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Amherst, New York. Prometheus Books. . = Sites and honors = In his home state of South Carolina he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame in 1984. His childhood home was relocated from Epworth to Greenwood, SC and is listed as a State Historic Site by the government of South Carolina, and was referred to as an \\"education icon\\" by the South Carolina Radio Network in 2011. Upon his death Mays was designated Phi Beta Kappa, Delta Sigma Rho, Delta Theta Chi, Omega Psi Phi. Nationally, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1982. He was elected to the Schomburg Honor Roll of Race Relations along with \\"only a dozen major leaders to be so honored.\\" In 2011, Wiliams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, introduced the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship at Williams College. The National School Boards Association created the Benjamin Elijah Mays Lifetime Achievement Award for \\"an individual who‚Äîduring his or her lifetime‚Äîhas demonstrated a longstanding commitment to the educational needs of urban school children through his or her service as a local school board member.\\" Due to his stature in academia he was frequently awarded honorary degreess from universities. He was awarded 40 of them during his lifetime and as of February 2018, he has received 56 honorary degrees. Bates College's highest alumni distinction is known as the Benjamin E. Mays Medal and is reserved for \\"the alumna or alumnus who has performed distinguished service to the larger (worldwide) community and been deemed a graduate of outstanding accomplishment.\\" The inaugural winner was Mays himself. The college established the Benjamin E. Mays Distinguished Professorship in 1985. Mays has been the subject or inspiration of memorials, and the eponym of hundreds of buildings, schools, streets, halls, awards, grants, scholarships, fellowships, and statues. Although he through his life had been appreciative of all of them, he \\"[was] reported to have said he was moved most deeply when a small black church in Ninety Six, South Carolina, renamed itself Mays United Methodist Church.

Mays High School in Pacolet, South Carolina, U.S. = Medal of Freedom effort = After Mays stepped down from the Atlanta Board of Education presidency in 1981, a petition was sent to the desk of U.S. President Ronald Reagan requesting that Mays be given the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but it was turned down. Georgian representative John Lewis proposed a bill in January 1993 that would commemorate Mays on a federal stamp and requested that Mays be given the Medal of Freedom posthumously. The request was sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton but his time as president ended before he could address the request. A request was sent once again to U.S. President George Bush by Georgian representatives Max Cleland and Zell Miller which passed both houses of Congress but has yet to be signed by a U.S. president. The petition was sent once more in 2012 to U.S. President Barack Obama, yet failed to be awarded.

It was first described in 1982 in Scotland's Royal National Larbert Institution by Dr D.A.A. Primrose. Primrose syndrome appears to occur spontaneously, regardless of family history. The cause is currently unknown and there are no known treatments. Signs and symptoms The common symptoms in all reported cases of primrose syndrome include ossified pinnae, learning disabilities or mental retardation, hearing problems, movement disorders (ataxia, paralysis, and parkinsonism among others (likely due, in part, to calcification of the basal ganglia), a torus palatinus (a neoplasm on the mouth's hard palate), muscle atrophy, and distorted facial features. Other symptoms usually occur, different in each case, but it is unknown whether or not these symptoms are caused by the same disease. Pathophysiology The cause of Primrose syndrome is currently unknown. This condition is extremely rare and seems to spontaneously occur, regardless of family history. In the case studied by Dalai et al. in 2010, it was found that an abnormally high amount of calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland to stabilize blood calcium levels, was present in the blood serum. This suggests that the thyroid gland is releasing an abnormal amount of calcitonin, resulting in the disruption of calcium level homeostasis. No molecular cause was found, but an expanded microarray analysis of the patient found a 225.5 kb deletion on chromosome 11p between rs12275693 and rs1442927. Whether or not this deletion is related to the syndrome or is a harmless mutation is unknown. The deletion was not present in the patient's mother's DNA sample, but the father's DNA was unavailable. Diagnosis Management Currently there are no known treatments. History There have been very few reported cases of Primrose syndrome worldwide. The first known case was described by D.A. Primrose in 1982. The patient was a 33-year-old mentally retarded male whose outer ears had ossified. Additional symptoms included muscle atrophy in the legs and hands, deafness, cataracts, and a tissue mass covering the roof of his mouth. In 1986, Calacott et al. described a mentally handicapped patient whose pinnae had ossified. The patient also experienced deafness, cataracts, skeletal deformities, and muscle atrophy. As the second reported case of such symptoms, it suggested that these symptoms were part of one entity, named \\"Primrose syndrome\\" In 1996, Lindor et al. reported a 43-year-old male patient with schizophrenia, as well as other neurological disorders, and severe pinnae calcification. Additional symptoms included hearing loss, stiffened joints, and facial deformities. In 2006, Mathijssen et al. described an adult male mentally retarded patient who had calcified pinnae and a neoplasm of the palate. The patient also had extensive hearing loss, little to no body hair, distorted facial features, and joint contractures. The patient also developed testicular cancer, but it is unknown whether or not it is related to the syndrome. The patient experienced cryptorchidism, a birth defect where one of the testes is not present at birth, that may have played a part in the formation of the tumor. In 2010, another similar case was studied extensively by Dalal et al. The patient was a mentally retarded 43-year-old woman who had hearing impairment, distorted facial features, muscle atrophy, cataracts, and ossification of cartilage. Additionally, she was born with Ebstein malformation, a congenital heart defect, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and hip dysplasia. Other symptoms included hypothyroidism, diabetes, and muscle control problems. A brain MRI showed that her basal ganglia had partially calcified, which may have contributed to her paraparesis and motor tics.

The pathway of the facial nerve is long and relatively convoluted, so there are a number of causes that may result in facial nerve paralysis. The most common is Bell's palsy, a disease of unknown cause that may only be diagnosed by exclusion of identifiable serious causes. Signs and symptoms Facial nerve paralysis is characterised by facial weakness, usually only in one side of the face, with other symptoms possibly including loss of taste, hyperacusis and decreased salivation and tear secretion. Other signs may be linked to the cause of the paralysis, such as vesicles in the ear, which may occur if the facial palsy is due to shingles. Symptoms may develop over several hours. Acute facial pain radiating from the ear may precede the onset of other symptoms. Causes =Bell's palsy= Bell's palsy is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis. There is no known cause of Bell's palsy, although it has been associated with herpes simplex infection. Bell's palsy may develop over several days, and may last several months, in the majority of cases recovering spontaneously. It is typically diagnosed clinically, in patients with no risk factors for other causes, without vesicles in the ear, and with no other neurological signs. Recovery may be delayed in the elderly, or those with a complete paralysis. Bell's palsy is often treated with corticosteroids. =Infection= Lyme disease, an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria and spread by ticks, can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, but it is expanding into other areas. The first sign of about 80% of Lyme infections, typically one or two weeks after a tick byte, is usually an expanding rash that may be accompanied by headaches, body aches, fatigue, or fever. In up to 10-15% of Lyme infections, facial palsy appears several weeks later, and may be the first sign of infection that is noticed, as the Lyme rash typically does not itch and is not painful. Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics. Reactivation of herpes zoster virus, as well as being associated with Bell's palsy, may also be a direct cause of facial nerve palsy. Reactivation of latent virus within the geniculate ganglion is associated with vesicles affecting the ear canal, and termed Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. In addition to facial paralysis, symptoms may include ear pain and vesicles, sensorineural hearing loss, and vertigo. Management includes Antiviral drugs and oral steroids. Otitis media is an infection in the middle ear, which can spread to the facial nerve and inflame it, causing compression of the nerve in its canal. Antibiotics are used to control the otitis media, and other options include a wide myringotomy (an incision in the tympanic membrane) or decompression if the patient does not improve. Chronic otitis media usually presents in an ear with chronic discharge (otorrhea), or hearing loss, with or without ear pain (otalgia). Once suspected, there should be immediate surgical exploration to determine if a cholesteatoma has formed as this must be removed if present. Inflammation from the middle ear can spread to the canalis facialis of the temporal bone - through this canal travels the facial nerve together with the statoacoustisus nerve. In the case of inflammation the nerve is exposed to edema and subsequent high pressure, resulting in a periferic type palsy. =Trauma= In blunt trauma, the facial nerve is the most commonly injured cranial nerve. Physical trauma, especially fractures of the temporal bone, may also cause acute facial nerve paralysis. Understandably, the likelihood of facial paralysis after trauma depends on the location of the trauma. Most commonly, facial paralysis follows temporal bone fractures, though the likelihood depends on the type of fracture. Transverse fractures in the horizontal plane present the highest likelihood of facial paralysis (40-50%). Patients may also present with blood behind the tympanic membrane, sensory deafness, and vertigo; the latter two symptoms due to damage to vestibulocochlear nerve and the inner ear. Longitudinal fracture in the vertical plane present a lower likelihood of paralysis (20%). Patients may present with blood coming out of the external auditory meatus), tympanic membrane tear, fracture of external auditory canal, and conductive hearing loss. In patients with mild injuries, management is the same as with Bell's palsy - protect the eyes and wait. In patients with severe injury, progress is followed with nerve conduction studies. If nerve conduction studies show a large (>90%) change in nerve conduction, the nerve should be decompressed. The facial paralysis can follow immediately the trauma due to direct damage to the facial nerve, in such cases a surgical treatment may be attempted. In other cases the facial paralysis can occur a long time after the trauma due to oedema and inflammation. In those cases steroids can be a good help. =Tumors= A tumor compressing the facial nerve anywhere along its complex pathway can result in facial paralysis. Common culprits are facial neuromas, congenital cholesteatomas, hemangiomas, acoustic neuromas, parotid gland neoplasms, or metastases of other tumours. Often, since facial neoplasms have such an intimate relationship with the facial nerve, removing tumors in this region becomes perplexing as the physician is unsure how to manage the tumor without causing even more palsy. Typically, benign tumors should be removed in a fashion that preserves the facial nerve, while malignant tumors should always be resected along with large areas of tissue around them, including the facial nerve. While this will inevitably lead to heightened paralysis, safe removal of a malignant neoplasm is worth the often treatable palsy that follows. In the best case scenario, paralysis can be corrected with techniques including hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, end-to-end nerve repair, cross facial nerve grafting, or muscle transfer/transposition techniques, such as the gracilis free muscle transfer. Patients with facial nerve paralysis resulting from tumours usually present with a progressive, twitching paralysis, other neurological signs, or a recurrent Bell's palsy-type presentation. The latter should always be suspicious, as Bell's palsy should not recur. A chronically discharging ear must be treated as a cholesteatoma until proven otherwise; hence, there must be immediate surgical exploration. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging should be used to identify the location of the tumour, and it should be managed accordingly. Other neoplastic causes include leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. =Stroke= Central facial palsy can be caused by a lacunar infarct affecting fibers in the internal capsule going to the nucleus. The facial nucleus itself can be affected by infarcts of the pontine arteries. Unlike peripheral facial palsy, central facial palsy does not affect the forehead, because the forehead is served by nerves coming from both motor cortexes. =Other= Other causes may include: * Diabetes mellitus * Facial nerve paralysis, sometimes bilateral, is a common manifestation of sarcoidosis of the nervous system, neurosarcoidosis. * Bilateral facial nerve paralysis may occur in Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, an autoimmune condition of the peripheral nervous system. * Moebius syndrome is a bilateral facial paralysis resulting from the underdevelopment of the VII cranial nerve (facial nerve), which is present at birth. The VI cranial nerve, which controls lateral eye movement, is also affected, so people with Moebius syndrome cannot form facial expression or move their eyes from side to side. Moebius syndrome is extremely rare, and its cause or causes are not known. * Facial piercings, namely eyebrow piercings or tongue piercings, can in very rare cases cause damage to the facial nerve. Diagnosis A medical history and physical examination, including a neurological examination, are needed for diagnosis. The first step is to observe what parts of the face do not move normally when the person tries to smile, blink, or raise the eyebrows. If the forehead wrinkles normally, a diagnosis of central facial palsy is made, and the person should be evaluated for stroke. Otherwise, the diagnosis is peripheral facial palsy, and its cause needs to be identified, if possible. Ramsey Hunt's syndrome causes pain and small blisters in the ear on the same side as the palsy. Otitis media, trauma, or post-surgical complications may alternatively become apparent from history and physical examination. If there is a history of trauma, or a tumour is suspected, a CT scan or MRI may be used to clarify its impact. Blood tests or x-rays may be ordered depending on suspected causes. The likelihood that the facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease should be estimated, based on recent history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats during warmer months, recent history of rash or symptoms such as headache and fever, and whether the palsy affects both sides of the face (much more common in Lyme than in Bell's palsy). If that likelihood is more than negligible, a serological test for Lyme disease should be performed. If the test is positive, the diagnosis is Lyme disease. If no cause is found, the diagnosis is Bell's Palsy. =Classification= The facial nerve Facial nerve paralysis may be divided into supranuclear and infranuclear lesions. In a clinical setting, other commonly used classifications include: intra-cranial and extra-cranial; acute, subacute and chronic duration. The Plastics Fella Guide to Facial Nerve Anatomy Supranuclear and nuclear lesions Central facial palsy can be caused by a lacunar infarct affecting fibers in the internal capsule going to the nucleus. The facial nucleus itself can be affected by infarcts of the pontine arteries. These are corticobulbar fibers travelling in internal capsule. Infranuclear lesions Infranuclear lesions refer to the majority of causes of facial palsy. Treatment If an underlying cause has been found for the facial palsy, it should be treated. If it is estimated that the likelihood that the facial palsy is caused by Lyme disease exceeds 10%, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. All other patients should be treated with corticosteroids and, if the palsy is severe, antivirals. Facial palsy is considered severe if the person is unable to close the affected eye completely or the face is asymmetric even at rest. Corticosteroids initiated within three days of Bell's palsy onset have been found to increase chances of recovery, reduce time to recovery, and reduce residual symptoms in case of incomplete recovery. However, for facial palsy caused by Lyme disease, corticosteroids have been found in some studies to harm outcomes. Other studies have found antivirals to possibly improve outcomes relative to corticosteroids alone for severe Bell's palsy. In those whose blinking is disrupted by the facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping.

For some time, Yoshinaka had desired to seize control of the clan from his cousins. Upon returning to Kyoto from his victories at Shinohara and Kurikara, he decided to split from the clan, plotting with Minamoto no Yukiie to kidnap Emperor Go-Shirakawa, and establish a government of their own, in the provinces north of Kyoto. But Yukiie did not, in the end, aid Yoshinaka in this scheme. Yoshinaka attacked the H≈çj≈´jidono (also known as the H≈çj≈´ji Palace), set it aflame, killed the defenders, and seized Emperor Go-Shirakawa. He was opposed by a number of court nobles and warrior monks from Mount Hiei and Miidera, but ultimately made it out of the city victorious, with the cloistered emperor as hostage. However, at this point, the Minamoto armies, under Yukiie, Yoritomo, Yoshitsune, and Noriyori were surrounding the capital.

Monument of Vasil Levski  History  The town was first mentioned in a 15th-century source as Uradmur. The current form appears for the first time in a source from 1488. The name is derived directly from the personal name Radomir or its adjectival form. In 1918, Bulgaria was ruled by Ferdinand of Bulgaria, under whom Aleksandar Stamboliyski had been imprisoned for opposing Bulgaria's participation in the Balkan War and its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. When in September the Allied forces broke into Bulgaria, Ferdinand agreed to release Stamboliyski in return for a promise to help restore order in the military. However, Stamboliyski instead aligned himself with the uprising and in Radomir proclaimed Bulgaria to be a republic. His supporters then attempted an attack on Sofia. The Radomir Rebellion was stopped when this force was defeated by Bulgarian and German tsarists, who also did not retain control for long as Bulgaria had signed an armistice with the Allies by the end of the month.  Places of interest  Radomir municipality hall The village of Baykalsko is a quiet and beautifully preserved natural settlement. The old church of Sveta Bogoroditsa, partially destroyed and rebuilt in the 19th century, has a recently restored, historic bell tower. A new cemetery bears the remains of generations on the opposite side of the village. The mayor's office and the post office are located across from the church of Bogoroditsa. The village is home to fewer elderly people and a growing population of seasonal visitors. Natural trails leading in and about nearby Konyavo Mountain, and the Choklyovo Marsh (, ), are tourist attractions of Baykalsko. The old name of the village, Choklyovo, has not been restored to date. The marsh of Choklyovo is a preserved area (Regional Environment and Waters Inspectorate ‚Äî Sofia), as it is the natural habitat of rare bird species and a repository of therapeutic mud. The village overlooking the lake consists of small houses traditionally made of mud and sticks. There is some small-scale construction from the 1970s and 1980s and several newer villas. Legend has it that a Medieval ruler, settled opposite the lake, issued a decree for all houses to face in his direction. Baykalsko may be reached by bus from Sofia or Kyustendil, or by train via Zemen. Bed & breakfast accommodations are available by arrangement.  Sport  The town is home to the FK Strumska Slava football team, who play in the Second Professional Football League, from the 2017‚Äì18 season.  Royalty  Radomir (1000‚Äì?) was also the name of a Bulgarian prince. Stounova house Radomir was the surname of Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: –ì–∞–≤—Ä–∏–ª –†–∞–¥–æ–º–∏—Ä), who ruled Bulgaria from October 1014 to August 1015.

The region played a significant role in the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. Inclusion in Italian Libya Detailed 1935 map of the Aouzou Strip The Aouzou strip was defined for the first time in the discussions between France and Italy after World War I, in relation to an award to Italy for the victory in that war. At the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, the Kingdom of Italy did not receive any of the German colonies, but instead was given the Oltre Giuba from the United Kingdom, and France agreed to give some Saharan territories to Italian Libya. After many discussions during the 1920s, in 1935 the Franco- Italian Agreement was signed between Benito Mussolini and Pierre Laval, which included a provision under which Italy would receive the Aouzou strip, which was to be added to Libya.Hodder, Lloyd, McLachlan (1998). Land-locked states of Africa and Asia, Volume 2, p. 32. Frank Cass, London, Great Britain. France's other motivations in concluding this agreement with Italy were to settle the status of the Italian Tunisian community in its protectorate of the country, to remove irredentist Italian claims to Nice, and to prevent Italy from growing closer to Nazi Germany by keeping it closely aligned with France and the United Kingdom (the Stresa Front). This policy failed two years later after Italy drifted into the German orbit by concluding the Pact of Steel with Nazi Germany, leading to the \\"instruments of ratification\\" of the Mussolini- Laval Treaty never being exchanged with France. Despite this the new border was conventionally assumed to be the southern boundary of Libya until 1955. History Claimed to be rich in uranium deposits,Libya Issue Brief, Congressional Research Service (US State Department). April 10, 2002. the area was the cause of dispute with Libya, which led to a war between the two countries. In 1973, Libya engaged in military operations in the Aouzou Strip to gain access to minerals and to use it as a base of influence in Chadian politics. This ultimately resulted in the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. Libya argued that the territory was inhabited by indigenous people who owed vassalage to the Senoussi Order and subsequently to the Ottoman Empire, and that this title had been inherited by Libya. It also supported its claim with an unratified 1935 treaty between France and Italy (the Mussolini-Laval Treaty), the colonial powers of Chad and Libya, respectively, that confirmed the possession of the strip by Italy. The frontier claimed by the Chadian government was based on a 1955 treaty between France and Libya, which, in turn, referred back to an 1899 agreement between Great Britain and France about \\"spheres of influence\\". Despite other differences, this was one position on which all Chadian political parties and factions were able to agree. During the so-called Toyota War in 1987, the final stage of the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, Chadian forces were able to force the Libyans to retreat from the Aouzou Strip. A cease-fire between Chad and Libya held from 1987 to 1988, followed by unsuccessful negotiations over the next several years. Finally a 1994 International Court of Justice decision found (by a majority of 16 to 1) in favour of Chad sovereignty over the Aouzou strip, and ended the Libyan claim. The United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Aouzou Strip Observer Group in Resolution 915 (May 1994) to monitor the withdrawal of Libyan troops, and terminated it in Resolution 926 (June 1994), when the withdrawal was completed.

() was a low-cost airline based in Don Mueang, Bangkok, Thailand.\\"Contact Us .\\" One-Two-GO Airlines. Retrieved on 4 March 2010. Its main base was Don Mueang International Airport, Bangkok. Always owned and managed by Orient Thai Airlines and owned by CEO Udom Tantiprasongchai and his wife Nina Tantriprasongchai, the One-Two-GO brand was retired in July 2010, and the aircraft re-branded as Orient Thai Airlines. On October 9, 2018, the airline ceased all operations.  History  The airline started operations on 3 December 2003. Following the crash of OG 269 in Phuket, Thailand on September 16, 2007, One-Two-GO was banned from flying in European Union nations due to safety concerns. On April 8, 2009, the European Commission added One-Two-GO Airlines to its blacklist of airline operators banned from entering European airspace. = Fallout from the crash of Flight 269 = Corruption within One-Two-GO Airlines and the Thai Department of Civil Aviation was a factor for the crash investigators of Flight 269. Australia's Channel 9 broadcast a program in November 2007 which detailed accusations of maintenance fraud and specifically by CEO Udom Tantiprasongchai, coercion and bribery of pilots to fly excessive hours. The program contained an interview with lead Thai investigator Director-General Vuttichai Singhamany as he reviewed the daily flight rosters for One-Two-GO given to him by reporter Ferguson, documenting the Captain and First Officer's schedules showing that both pilots had flown beyond the legal limit for the week and for the month of the crash. Director-General Vuttichai said he would demand an explanation for the fraud from One-Two-GO. In late February 2008, the victim's families, concerned about the impartiality and transparency of the crash investigation, created a website and on-line petition called InvestigateUdom.com calling for a proper investigation into the root causes of the crash. The lead Thai Department of Civil Aviation investigator reported that documents he had received from One-Two-GO were fiction. The National Transportation Safety Board (which were also investigating the accident) report included the true work rosters, obtained by the family of a victim. The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) report documented possible check ride fraud among four other One-Two-GO pilots in the months following the crash. Three years after the crash, the British government began its inquest process into the deaths of the eight British citizens killed. The inquest, held 22‚Äì23 March 2011, was presided over by H.M. Coroner, S.P.G. Fisher. Coroner Fisher relied on a British aviation investigator, the NTSB, and Thai reports, and victim and family statements to make his conclusions. He cited the \\"flagrant disregard for passenger safety\\" by the airline and said, \\"the primary failure so far as I am concerned relates to the corporate culture which prevailed both One-Two- GO Airlines and Orient Thai Airlines prior to and following the air crash.\\" Fisher twice contacted the airline to send a representative to the hearing. The airline replied that they would not take part in the proceedings.

Thai aviation officials initially claimed that weather was a probable factor. The cause of the crash was later determined to be multiple flight crew errors caused by systemic failures including corruption and lack of training at One-Two-GO and within Thailand's Civil Aviation Authority, Department of Civil Aviation.

History Tellabs traces its roots to a meeting in 1974 over a kitchen table in suburban Chicago. According to company founder Michael Birck, a group of six men with backgrounds in electrical engineering and sales drank coffee and brainstormed ideas for a new telecom company. They aimed to build a company that offered customers products and services that met their specific needs. After raising $110,000 in capital, they incorporated as Tellabs in the spring of 1975; the name combined the idea of telephones and laboratories. The start-up only had a one-man research department, a second-hand soldering iron picked up for $25, and an outdated oscilloscope. In a matter of months, Tellabs began making echo suppressors, which suppress annoying echoes on phone calls. During this time, the founding partners drew no salaries. The company went public in July 1980, ending the year with sales of $43.7 million. In September 1981, Tellabs introduced the industry's first echo canceller, an advance over the original echo suppressors that synthesized an echo and electronically subtracted it. By 1990, Tellabs had grown to 2,000 employees at 25 locations globally and sales of $211 million. Tellabs made several acquisitions and expanded globally in the 1980s and into the 1990s, including Coherent Communications Systems Corp. and Martis Oy in Finland. In 1991, the company took a new direction, releasing its SONET- based TITAN 5500 digital cross-connect system. These systems switch traffic from one circuit to another, connecting traffic inside and between networks. Richard Notebaert, who had led Ameritech, the Midwestern AT&T; spin-off until it was acquired by SBC in 1999, took over Tellabs as CEO in September 2000. Pundits labeled Notebaert the ‚Äú$6 billion man.‚Äù However, as the Chicago Sun- Times also reported, the telecom industry also collapsed. The Chicago Sun- Times reported: ‚ÄúTelecom went from boom to bust as venture capital dried up and customers cancelled orders for the sort of equipment made by Tellabs and its competitors, including Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies.‚Äù In 2003, following industry trends and after 28 years as a manufacturer, Tellabs sold its last plant in Illinois and outsourced its manufacturing. The company continued downsizing. Krish Prabhu, former chief operating officer of Alcatel, took over as CEO in February 2004. Prabhu saw opportunities as Internet use grew and demanded faster connections, as well as video and better VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) calling. Tellabs acquired two companies in 2004. They purchased AFC, a top provider of broadband access solutions with a customer base of more than 800 service providers worldwide at the time of the mergerhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afc-announces-agreement-to- acquire-marconis-north-american-access-business-58706017.html in a deal worth $1.9 billion, and Marconi Communications North American Access, which sold fiber-access services to regional Bell operating companies and local exchange carriers; At the time of the merger, Marconi had a customer base that included many of the world's largest telecommunications operators, managing more than 4 million lines of capacity and about 1 million deployed lines. By 2007, nearly half of Tellabs' revenue came from products added since 2003. Prabhu also presided over more cutbacks as the telecom industry continued to struggle. In January 2008, Tellabs announced that it was cutting 225 jobs during the year. This would leave Tellabs with about 3,500 jobs, down from a peak of 9,000 during the boom in 2001. Prabhu stepped down in March 2008 for personal reasons; Birck praised him at his departure. Tellabs internally promoted Robert W. Pullen, who had 23 years of varied experience at Tellabs, to succeed Pradhu as chief executive and president effective March 1, 2008. He was chairman of the executive board of Telecommunications Industry Association. In 2009 Tellabs acquired WiChorus, a San-Jose based Silicon Valley start-up with a mobile packet core platform, a decision that led to the decline of their data business. After Pullen was hospitalized in June 2012 due to cancer, Dan Kelly was appointed acting CEO and president; Kelly later assumed the full offices in November 2012, following Pullen's death. Kelly had previously served as executive vice president of global products and had worked with the company for over 25 years. In 2013, Tellabs was acquired by Marlin Equity Partners, a global investment company. Marlin announced plans to establish an independent business for the Tellabs Access product portfolio, aiming to accelerate Tellabs' development of Optical Local Area Network (OLAN) technology. Marlin announced it would target OLAN to Enterprise and Government agencies, while continuing to support and expand its TeleCommunications portfolio. The Optical Transport, Metro Ethernet and Mobility business units of Tellabs were spun off into Coriant, a separate company owned by Marlin Equity. Mike Dagenais, an industry veteran who had previously served as CEO of Radisys Corporation and as president and CEO of Continuous Computing, was tapped to head Tellabs as president and CEO. The focus of Tellabs is now OLAN technology. OLAN uses fiber, which is faster, more secure, and more stable in comparison to traditional copper infrastructure. For service providers, Tellabs Access Platforms provide Broadband access to more than 5 million homes in North America. On October 11, 2017, it was announced that Jim Norrod had been named president and CEO of Tellabs, following the retirement of Mike Dagenais. In December 2019, Tellabs announced that Rich Schroder had been appointed president and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Schroder has held numerous positions within Tellabs and most recently served as Chief Operating Officer. Rich is a telecom industry veteran with past experience running global multi-site organizations in Asia, Europe and across the U.S. on behalf of AFC, Marconi, RELTEC, DSC and Siemens. Corporate Tellabs global corporate headquarters is located in the northwet quadrant of Dallas, Texas in the city of Carrollton, Texas.

The Gargon Terror (UK title), The Boy from Outer Space, and originally titled The Ray Gun Terror) is a 1959 American independent black-and-white science fiction cult film released by Warner Bros. The film was produced, written, and directed by Tom Graeff and stars David Love, Dawn Bender, Bryan Grant, Harvey B. Dunn, Tom Graeff, and King Moody. Teenagers from Outer Space was distributed theatrically by Warner Brothers on a double feature with Gigantis the Fire Monster, the English- dubbed version of the 1955 Japanese giant monster film Godzilla Raids Again. In the film, a young alien named Derek abandons his crew to search for a new life on Earth, while one of his crewmates is sent to find him while they attempt to eradicate human life in order to farm Earth with giant lobster-like livestock they call Gargons. Plot A flying saucer arrives on Earth while searching for planets suitable to raise \\"Gargons\\", a lobster-like but air- breathing monster that is a delicacy on their home planet. Thor (Bryan Grant) shows his alien contempt for Earth's creatures by vaporizing a dog named Sparky. Crew member Derek (David Love), after discovering an inscription on Sparky's dog tag, fears that the Gargons might destroy Earth's native inhabitants. This makes the other aliens scoff at the thought. Being members of the \\"supreme race\\", they disdain \\"foreign beings\\", no matter how intelligent; they pride themselves that \\"families\\" and \\"friendships\\" are forbidden on their world. Derek turns out to be a member of an underground rebellion that commemorates the more humane periods of their world's history. The Gargon they brought with them suddenly falls sick to Earth's atmosphere. While his crew members are distracted, Derek escapes on foot. Eventually, the Gargon revives from being unconscious. When the Captain gives his report, Derek is quickly connected to the Leader of their race (Gene Sterling); revealing to be his son, although Derek is unaware of this. Thor is sent to hunt down Derek, with orders to bring him back alive or kill him and any other intelligent beings to protect their mission to Earth. The rest of the crew returned to their homeworld, leaving the Gargon behind in a near by cave. Meanwhile, Derek finds the home address he found on the dog's tag. There he meets Betty Morgan (Dawn Anderson) and her Grandpa Joe (Harvey B. Dunn). They have a room to rent, and Derek inadvertently becomes a boarder. When Betty's friend, reporter Joe Rogers (Tom Graeff), cannot make it to their afternoon swim at Alice Woodward's place (Sonia Torgeson), Derek tags along with Betty. He shows the tag to Betty, who recognizes it immediately. Derek takes her to the place where the spacecraft landed and shows her Sparky's remains. She does not believe him, so he describes Thor's weapon that can also vaporize humans. Betty takes this surprisingly well and vows to help Derek stop his crewmate. For the rest of the day, Betty and Derek have several run-ins with Thor, and Joe follows up on stories of skeletons popping up all over town. Eventually, Thor is wounded, and he kidnaps both Derek and Betty to help him receive medical attention, in the process revealing Derek's true parentage to them. Two car chases and a gunfight follow, and Thor is finally captured by Earth authorities after plummeting off a cliff in a stolen car. Shortly after, the Gargon grows immensely large, after killing and devouring a policeman investigating the alien's landing site, and attacking numerous people. Derek and Betty go to the car wreck site to look for Thor's raygun. They share a kiss, and Derek vows to stay on Earth. The Gargon suddenly appears and ruins their romantic moment, but Derek finds the disintegrator ray under a rock just in time for them to escape. Unfortunately, it is damaged and out of power. The giant Gargon begins heading towards the town. They follow and confront it, having used the electricity from the overhead power lines to fuel the raygun's components. Derek eventually kills the monster, but it is too late. The invading fleet appears in Earth's orbit. Derek retrieves Thor from the police and the whole gang, including Joe and Grandpa, hurry to the landing site. He then reunites with the Captain and meets his father for the first time. Derek pretends to feel regret for his insubordination and offers to help guide the spaceships to land. Derek then goes into the spacecraft alone, making the ultimate sacrifice. Leading the invasion fleet at full speed directly towards his ground location, causing a massive explosion, killing his father, the Captain and Thor in the process. Derek does not survive the blast but is remembered by Betty for declaring, \\"I shall make the Earth my home. And I shall never, never leave it.\\" Cast * David Love as Derek * Dawn Bender as Betty Morgan * Bryan Grant as Thor * Harvey B.

One notable aspect of the film is that it was largely the work of a single person, Tom Graeff, who, in addition to playing the role of reporter Joe Rogers, wrote, directed, edited, and produced the film, on which he also provided cinematography, special effects, and music coordination. Producers Bryan and Ursula Pearson (\\"Thor\\" and \\"Hilda\\") and Gene Sterling (\\"The Leader\\") provided the film's $14,000 budget, which was less than shoestring even by the standards of the day. =Cost-effective measures= According to Bryan Pearson, the crew employed many guerrilla tactics in order to cut costs. Director Tom Graeff secured for free the location used for Betty Morgan's house by posing as a UCLA student (which he had attended and graduated from 5 years earlier). The older woman who owned the house even let the crew use her electricity to power their equipment. Graeff shot in many nearby locations, mostly in the vicinity of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, that doubled as more important city landmarks. Graeff's steady hand and framing kept most of the real locations subdued, creating a convincing low-budget illusion of a small town. Other cost-cutting measures didn't work as well: The aliens' costumes were simple flight suits clearly decorated with masking tape, dress shoes covered in socks, and surplus Air Force flight helmets. The use of stock footage, in lieu of real special effects and pre-Spielbergian \\"looking\\" shots that replaced actual visuals of the invading alien spaceships, seriously undercut the film's ending. Props included a single-bolted-joint skeleton re- used for every dead body seen on screen, a multi-channel sound mixer that was not camouflaged (clearly bearing the label \\"Multichannel Mixer MCM-2\\") as a piece of alien equipment, and a dime store Hubley's \\"Atomic Disintegrator\\" toy as the aliens' disintegrator ray gun. =Sound design and score= Graeff also pre-recorded some of the film's dialog for several scenes and had the actors lip-synchronize their dialog with their scene actions. The film score used stock music, which had been composed by William Loose and Fred Steiner. The same stock music has been recycled in countless B-movies, like Red Zone Cuba, The Killer Shrews, and most notably Night of the Living Dead. Release and legacy In June 1958 Bryan Pearson, who invested $5,000 in the production with his wife Ursula, took Graeff to court in order to gain back the original investment and a percentage of any profits. The Pearsons had learned that Graeff had allegedly sold the film (originally titled The Boy From Out of This World),p.72 Ryfle, Steve Japan's Favorite Mon-star: The Unauthorized Biography of \\"The Big G\\" ECW Press, 1998 which did not happen until early 1959. He heard nothing more on their investment or a percentage of profits to which they were entitled. The legal dispute dragged on for a year. Pearson received his $5000 investment, but the judge ruled there was no profit to share. Tom and the Pearsons, who had been good friends during the production of Teenagers, never spoke to each other again.Los Angeles County Superior Court Records, Case No. 702 320, July 3, 1959 The film failed to perform at the box office, placing further stress on an already-burdened Graeff, and in the fall of 1959, he suffered a breakdown, proclaiming himself as the second coming of Christ. After a number of public appearances, followed by a subsequent arrest for disrupting a church service, Graeff disappeared from Hollywood until 1964. He committed suicide in 1970. The film went on to become a cult classic among sci-fi fans and was later shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000, Elvira's Movie Macabre, and Off Beat Cinema. It was also included in the video game Destroy All Humans! It becomes unlocked and ready to play in full once the player beats the game. =Critical reception= The film opened on June 3, 1959 to negative but not crippling reviews. The Los Angeles Times review stated \\"what a curious little film this is [...] there are flashes of astonishing sensitivity half buried in the mass of tritisms.\\" And of the director, Tom Graeff, \\"when he stops spreading himself so incredibly thin, I think his work will bear watching\\". '' Public domain In 1987, the film entered the public domain in the United States and worldwide because Warner Bros. did not renew the film's copyright registration in the 28th year after its creation. As a result, the film has received numerous \\"bargain bin\\" DVD releases. MST3Ks version was released by Rhino Home Video as part of their \\"Collection, Volume 6\\" box set.

His fourth term was marked by allegations of widespread corruption which were popularized by muckraking journalist Lincoln Steffens in a 1903 article in McClure's Magazine titled The Shame of Minneapolis. Ames was found guilty of corruption, but after a successful appeal and multiple mistrials the charges were dropped. Early life and military service Ames was born in Garden Prairie, Illinois on January 18, 1842 to Dr. Alfred Elisha Ames and Martha A. Ames. In 1852, Ames' family relocated to near Fort Snelling in the Minnesota Territory. At this point the area was still largely undeveloped (they were only the seventh homestead claim made in Minneapolis). Ames attended local public schools which were partially run by the federal government. While attending high school in 1857, Ames became employed as a \\"printer's devil\\" and a newspaper carrier for the Northwestern Democrat (one of the first newspapers in Minneapolis). After graduating from high school in 1858, Ames pursued a career in medicine. Though he received much of his experience and training by observing and working with his father, he attended some classes at Rush Medical College in Chicago and received his M.D. on February 5, 1862. After graduating with his M.D., Ames returned to Minneapolis intending to start his career as a doctor. After the outbreak of the American Civil War and tensions with the Dakota people began to flare up, he enlisted in the 9th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a private. He was later transferred to the 7th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment as an assistant surgeon. He served with the 7th Minnesota for three years in both the Dakota War of 1862 and in several battles in the western theater of the Civil War. He was promoted to the rank of surgeon major before mustering out of service in August 1865. Medical career Following the war, Ames briefly returned to Minnesota to work in the medical field with his father. His popularity among Civil War veterans was such that he was elected to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1866 on a \\"soldiers' ticket.\\" In 1868, he decided to move west to California. Once there he joined the newspaper business, becoming managing editor of the Alta California. Ames remained in California until 1874 when he was summoned home due to his father's death. Ames took over his father's medical practice in Minneapolis and developed a reputation as a kind and sympathetic figure. He was well known for treating the poor at no charge and for answering calls at any time of the day. He also served as a firefighter. In 1880, when a tornado devastated both St. Cloud and Sauk Rapids, \\"Doc Ames\\" arrived at the scene in order to treat the injured. This brought him to nationwide attention. Political rise Ames became active in the city's Democratic party. He served on the Minneapolis City Council in 1875‚Äì1876 and was named the city's health officer in 1878. He was elected the city's mayor three times in 1876, 1882 and 1886. His first term was described as \\"an indifferent success\\" but his second and third terms generated accusations of corruption. Ames was not as successful with his attempts at higher office. During this era Minnesota was heavily dominated by the Republican party and thus Ames faced difficult odds for most state offices. In 1877 he ran unsuccessfully as lieutenant governor. In 1886, he ran for governor but narrowly lost to Andrew Ryan McGill. The narrow margin of victory sparked controversy over who was the actual winner, and the election was contested until Ames decided the effort was not worth the time. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives and, at one time, had been under consideration as a candidate for the vice presidency. Ames was instrumental in the creation of a veteran's home in Minneapolis. He initially promoted the idea at the state's Democratic convention in 1886. Despite losing the election, the Republican administration accepted his suggestions and authorized the construction of the Minnesota Veterans Home. Ames later served there as a surgeon. After being defeated in an election for park board in 1888 and losing an independent campaign for mayor in 1898, Ames devised a new strategy. In the 1900 primary election for mayor, he exploited a newly adopted rule which changed the city's primary elections to an open primary (allowing voters to vote for candidates in either party). He campaigned for votes as a Republican (knowing the competition was limited) and narrowly won the nomination. He went on to win the general election in 1900. Between his underhanded election strategy and accusations of corruption in his prior administrations, Ames was described as \\"damned politically, socially and professionally\\" when he entered office in 1901. \\"The Shame of Minneapolis\\" After entering office, Ames consolidated his power over the city's police department (the one area of city government which the mayor had full control over). He fired nearly half of the city's officers and replaced them with political allies and henchmen. He installed his brother Frederick W. Ames, \\"a weak, vacillating individual,\\" as the city's police chief. Norman W. King, a gambler and underworld figure, became the city's chief of detectives. Medical student and confidant Irwin A. Gardner was put in charge of the city's vice squad. Ames and the Minneapolis police began operating as an organized crime syndicate, extorting protection money and \\"fines\\" from illegal businesses of various kinds. The money collected was turned over to Ames and divided between him and his associates. Minneapolis was promoted as an \\"open city\\" to criminals across the country and criminals were released from the city's jail. Illegal businesses such as opium joints, gambling parlors, and houses of prostitution blossomed, many in the Gateway district. It was speculated that women were setting up candy stores to run a legitimate business to children and workers out front, but providing the services of prostitutes in the back. After a year in office, Ames' organization began to swirl out of control. Ames was drinking heavily and the various police and politicians under him began to fight among themselves, withholding money from Ames or developing their own extortion schemes without his approval. Attempts by the Hennepin County sheriff to crack down on the widespread criminal activities were quashed, but even average citizens were aware of the city's descent into corruption. Prosecution In April 1902, a grand jury under the leadership of foreman Hovey C. Clarke began an investigation into the Minneapolis city government and its officials. Clarke was a respected and successful citizen who singlehandedly took on the case, dismissing the county's prosecutor when he was unwilling to attack Ames. Clarke paid private detectives, both locally known men and others from out of town, to investigate. After obtaining enough evidence to indict two of Ames' henchmen, they were convinced to turn state's evidence and provide information on others in the organization. By June 1902, indictments has been made against Fred Ames, Gardner and others. Before he too was convicted, Ames fled the city after announcing he has been hired to run a hotel in West Baden, Indiana. He attempted to stay in power from Indiana, but finally announced his resignation as mayor effective September 6, 1902. As his former allies were tried and indicted, Ames remained on the run. In February 1903, he was arrested at the house of Rev. C. H. Chapin in Hancock, New Hampshire. Despite a \\"strong fight on the part of the fugitive,\\" Ames was extradited to Minnesota and put on trial for receiving a bribe of six hundred dollars from a prostitute. Based on the testimony of his co-conspirators, including his bagman Irwin A. Gardner, Ames was found guilty and sentenced to six years in the Minnesota State Prison at Stillwater. The sentence was overturned on appeal and, after two additional trials ended as mistrials, all legal action against him was ceased. Later life After the end of the final trial, Ames returned to Minneapolis to practice medicine. He died quite suddenly during the night on November 16, 1911. His obituary in the Minneapolis Morning Tribune described Ames as a 33rd degree Scottish Rite Freemason, and a Knight Templar. He was also a member of the Knights of Pythias. After a service inside his home by a Unitarian minister, his body was cremated in Minneapolis's Lakewood Cemetery. He left his widow a sum of $1,410.94 and a sum of $1 to each of his surviving children.

He is best known for his 18 year playing career with Leeds United making over 400 first team appearances. With Leeds he won the 1972 FA Cup Final and the 1973-74 Football League. He was a runner-up in 3 other senior cup finals with Leeds. Harvey gained 16 caps for Scotland including 3 at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. He and his compatriots were eliminated unbeaten at the end of the group stage when Harvey kept a clean sheet against Brazil and conceded only one goals in 3 games. Playing career =Leeds United= Born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire in 1948, Harvey attended Foxwood School (in the Seacroft area of the city), and played for Leeds City Boys before leaving school to work in a Stylo shoe factory. He was signed as a professional footballer by Don Revie in February 1965, after having played as an apprentice for two years. Harvey was the reserve goalkeeper for Leeds United during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was on the reserves' bench when Leeds won the League Cup and the Fairs Cup in 1968, the League championship in 1969, and the Fairs Cup in 1971. In the 1970 FA Cup Final, an error by first-choice goalkeeper Gary Sprake allowed opponents Chelsea to equalise in the first half. Sprake was blameless for the second equaliser, but Harvey replaced him for the replay, which Leeds lost 2‚Äì1. In the 1971‚Äì72 season, Harvey played only eleven matches, but was selected ahead of Sprake for the 1972 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, as Sprake was suffering from a knee injury. Leeds won 1‚Äì0 with an Allan Clarke goal, and from that point on Harvey was the first-choice goalkeeper. Harvey played 63 times in the 1972‚Äì73 season, and played in both the FA Cup Final and the European Cup Winners Cup Final ‚Äì ending up on the losing side both times. Leeds put together a 29-match unbeaten start to the 1973‚Äì74 season, winning the League championship and earning Harvey the title medal to which he had not been entitled five seasons earlier. At the start of the 1974‚Äì75 season, Harvey took the last penalty during the shoot-out at the Charity Shield game against Liverpool but missed, thus allowing Liverpool to carry the trophy home. Later in the season Harvey was injured in a car crash. He missed the rest of the season replaced by his understudy David Stewart. Stewart was praised for his bravery and \\"inspirational saves\\" beating Anderlecht and F.C. Barcelona in the 1974-75 European Cup. Leeds were beaten 2‚Äì0 by Bayern Munich in the final in Paris. The rest of the 1970s saw Leeds decline after the ageing team Revie built broke up. Harvey left in 1980. =Vancouver Whitecaps= Harvey moved to NASL club Vancouver Whitecaps in 1980. He had an unsteady first season with Vancouver, and even though his form improved in the second season in the NASL, injuries from another car accident prevented him from regaining his form and place. =Return to Leeds United= Harvey returned to Leeds in 1983, by which time the club had been relegated to the old Second Division. By the time he left in 1985, he had played under three of his old teammates: Allan Clarke, Eddie Gray and Billy Bremner. Harvey made over 400 career first team appearances for Leeds.https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/heritage-and- retro/retro/david-harvey-fans-memories-dependable-leeds-united- goalkeeper-2907856 =Later career= Harvey played 6 league games for Bradford City in 1985. This was under the management of an ex-Leeds teammate, Trevor Cherry. He then played 3 league games in Scotland for Morton in 1986. He next played non-league football with Whitby Town and Harrogate Town before his retirement from the game aged 37. =International career= Harvey made his debut for Scotland in a 2‚Äì0 win over Denmark, selected through his Scots father. In his 16 full caps he was part of eight victories, four draws and four defeats. He was selected as Scotland's first-choice keeper for the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. Scotland went out after the group stage unbeaten on goal difference after a 2‚Äì0 win against Zaire and draws with Brazil (0-0) and Yugoslavia (1-1). Life after football He retired from football at the age of 37 years. He managed a public house at Stamford Bridge, near York. He then became a postman, saying, \\"The sorting office atmosphere was like a dressing room\\". In 1994, with his second wife, June (and their five children), he bought a 150-year-old stone cottage with 10 acres of farmland on Sanday in Scotland's Orkney Islands. He again worked as a postman. On 24 December 2009, he suffered a heart attack, from which he recovered. In July 2020 Harvey relocated to the Lochmaben near Dumfries for greater accessibility to his grandchildren in comparison to Orkney.

Many but not all cycloadditions are concerted and thus pericyclic. Nonconcerted cycloadditions are not pericyclic. As a class of addition reaction, cycloadditions permit carbon‚Äìcarbon bond formation without the use of a nucleophile or electrophile. Cycloadditions can be described using two systems of notation. An older but still common notation is based on the size of linear arrangements of atoms in the reactants. It uses parentheses: (i + j + ...) where the variables are the numbers of linear atoms in each reactant. The product is a cycle of size (i + j + ...). In this system, the standard Diels-Alder reaction is a (4 + 2)-cycloaddition, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is a (3 + 2)-cycloaddition and cyclopropanation of a carbene with an alkene a (2 + 1)-cycloaddition. A more recent, IUPAC-preferred notation, first introduced by Woodward and Hoffmann, uses square brackets to indicate the number of electrons, rather than carbon atoms, involved in the formation of the product. In the [i + j + ...] notation, the standard Diels-Alder reaction is a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition, while the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is also a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition. Thermal cycloadditions and their stereochemistry Thermal cycloadditions are those cycloadditions where the reactants are in the ground electronic state. They usually have (4n + 2) œÄ electrons participating in the starting material, for some integer n. These reactions occur for reasons of orbital symmetry in a suprafacial-suprafacial or antarafacial-antarafacial manner (rare). There are a few examples of thermal cycloadditions which have 4n œÄ electrons (for example the [2 + 2]-cycloaddition). These proceed in a suprafacial- antarafacial sense, such as the dimerisation of ketene, in which the orthogonal set of p orbitals allows the reaction to proceed via a crossed transition state. Photochemical cycloadditions and their stereochemistry Cycloadditions in which 4n œÄ electrons participate can also occur via photochemical activation. Here, one component has an electron promoted from the HOMO (œÄ bonding) to the LUMO (œÄ* antibonding). Orbital symmetry is then such that the reaction can proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. An example is the DeMayo reaction. Another example is shown below, the photochemical dimerization of cinnamic acid. The two trans alkenes react head- to-tail, and the isolated isomers are called truxillic acids. :Cinnamic Acid CycloAddition Cycloaddition of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene Supramolecular effects can influence these cycloadditions. The cycloaddition of trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethene is directed by resorcinol in the solid-state in 100% yield. Some cycloadditions instead of œÄ bonds operate through strained cyclopropane rings, as these have significant œÄ character. For example, an analog for the Diels-Alder reaction is the quadricyclane-DMAD reaction: center In the (i+j+...) cycloaddition notation i and j refer to the number of atoms involved in the cycloaddition. In this notation, a Diels-Alder reaction is a (4+2)cycloaddition and a 1,3-dipolar addition such as the first step in ozonolysis is a (3+2)cycloaddition. The IUPAC preferred notation however, with [i+j+...] takes electrons into account and not atoms. In this notation, the DA reaction and the dipolar reaction both become a [4+2]cycloaddition. The reaction between norbornadiene and an activated alkyne is a [2+2+2]cycloaddition. Types of cycloaddition =Diels-Alder reactions= The Diels-Alder reaction is perhaps the most important and commonly taught cycloaddition reaction. Formally it is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction and exists in a huge range of forms, including the inverse electron-demand Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction, Hexadehydro Diels-Alder reaction and the related alkyne trimerisation. The reaction can also be run in reverse in the retro- Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. :Diels-Alder reaction Reactions involving heteroatoms are known; including the aza-Diels‚ÄìAlder and Imine Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction. =Huisgen cycloadditions= The Huisgen cycloaddition reaction is a (2+3)cycloaddition. :1,3-cycloaddition =Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition= The Nitrone-olefin cycloaddition is a (3+2)cycloaddition. :Nitrone olefin cycloaddition =Iron-catalyzed 2+2 olefin cycloaddition= Iron[pyridine(diimine)] catalysts contain a redox active ligand in which the central iron atom can coordinate with two simple, unfunctionalized olefin double bonds. The catalyst can be written as a resonance between a structure containing unpaired electrons with the central iron atom in the II oxidation state, and one in which the iron is in the 0 oxidation state. This gives it the flexibility to engage in binding the double bonds as they undergo a cyclization reaction, generating a cyclobutane structure via C-C reductive elimination; alternatively a cyclobutene structure may be produced by beta- hydrogen elimination. Efficiency of the reaction varies substantially depending on the alkenes used, but rational ligand design may permit expansion of the range of reactions that can be catalyzed. =Cheletropic reactions= Cheletropic reactions are a subclass of cycloadditions. The key distinguishing feature of cheletropic reactions is that on one of the reagents, both new bonds are being made to the same atom. The classic example is the reaction of sulfur dioxide with a diene. :150px Other Other cycloaddition reactions exist: [4+3] cycloadditions, [6+4] cycloadditions, [2 + 2] photocycloadditions, and [4+4] photocycloadditions Formal cycloadditions Cycloadditions often have metal-catalyzed and stepwise radical analogs, however these are not strictly speaking pericyclic reactions. When in a cycloaddition charged or radical intermediates are involved or when the cycloaddition result is obtained in a series of reaction steps they are sometimes called formal cycloadditions to make the distinction with true pericyclic cycloadditions. One example of a formal [3+3]cycloaddition between a cyclic enone and an enamine catalyzed by n-butyllithium is a Stork enamine / 1,2-addition cascade reaction: Intermolecular Formal [3+3] Cycloaddition Reaction References Category:Reaction mechanisms Category:Ring forming reactions ","title":"Cycloaddition"},{"id":"1256648","text":"A sigmatropic reaction in organic chemistry is a pericyclic reaction wherein the net result is one œÉ-bond is changed to another œÉ-bond in an uncatalyzed intramolecular reaction.Carey, F.A. and R.J. Sundberg. Advanced Organic Chemistry Part A The name sigmatropic is the result of a compounding of the long-established sigma designation from single carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds and the Greek word tropos, meaning turn. In this type of rearrangement reaction, a substituent moves from one part of a œÄ-bonded system to another part in an intramolecular reaction with simultaneous rearrangement of the œÄ system. True sigmatropic reactions are usually uncatalyzed, although Lewis acid catalysis is possible. Sigmatropic reactions often have transition-metal catalysts that form intermediates in analogous reactions. The most well-known of the sigmatropic rearrangements are the [3,3] Cope rearrangement, Claisen rearrangement, Carroll rearrangement, and the Fischer indole synthesis. Overview of sigmatropic shifts =Woodward‚ÄìHoffman sigmatropic shift nomenclature= Sigmatropic rearrangements are concisely described by an order term [i,j], which is defined as the migration of a œÉ-bond adjacent to one or more œÄ systems to a new position (i‚àí1) and (j‚àí1) atoms removed from the original location of the œÉ-bond. When the sum of i and j is an even number, this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral, all C atom chain. An odd number is an indication of the involvement of a charged C atom or of a heteroatom lone pair replacing a CC double bond. Thus, [1,5] and [3,3] shifts become [1,4] and [2,3] shifts with heteroatoms, while preserving symmetry considerations. Hydrogens are omitted in the third example for clarity. :500px A convenient means of determining the order of a given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new œÉ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor. :500px In the case of hydrogen atom migrations, a similar technique may be applied. When determining the order of a sigmatropic shift involving a hydrogen atom migration it is critical to count across all atoms involved in the reaction rather than only across the closest atoms. For example, the following hydrogen atom migration is of order [1,5], attained by counting counterclockwise through the œÄ system, rather than the [1,3] order designation through the ring CH2 group that would mistakenly result if counted clockwise. :300px As a general approach, one can simply draw the transition state of the reaction. For a sigmatropic reaction, the transition state will consist of two fragments, joined together by the forming and breaking œÉ-bonds. The sigmatropic reaction is named as a [i,j]-sigmatropic rearrangement (i ‚â§ j) if these two fragments consist of i and j atoms. This is illustrated below, with the relevant fragments shown in color. :500x500px =Suprafacial and antarafacial shifts= In principle, all sigmatropic shifts can occur with either a retention or inversion of the geometry of the migrating group, depending upon whether the original bonding lobe of the migrating atom or its other lobe is used to form the new bond. :500px In cases of stereochemical retention, the migrating group translates without rotation into the bonding position, while in the case of stereochemical inversion the migrating group both rotates and translates to reach its bonded conformation. However, another stereochemical transition effect equally capable of producing inversion or retention products is whether the migrating group remains on the original face of the œÄ system after rebonding or instead transfers to the opposite face of the œÄ system. If the migrating group remains on the same face of the œÄ system, the shift is known as suprafacial, while if the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift,Woodward, R.B.; Hoffmann, R.

The Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules dictate that it would proceed in an antarafacial shift. Although such a shift is symmetry allowed, the Mobius topology required in the transition state prohibits such a shift because it is geometrically impossible, which accounts for the fact that enols do not isomerize without an acid or base catalyst.Miller, Bernard. Advanced Organic Chemistry. 2nd Ed. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Prentice Hall. 2004. :Impossible shift Thermal alkyl shifts Thermal alkyl [1,3] shifts, similar to [1,3] hydride shifts, must proceed antarafacially. Here the geometry of the transition state is prohibitive, but an alkyl group, due to the nature of its orbitals, can invert its geometry, form a new bond with the back lobe of its sp3 orbital, and therefore proceed via a suprafacial shift. These reactions are still not common in open-chain compounds because of the highly ordered nature of the transition state, which is more readily achieved in cyclic molecules. :[1,3] Alkyl shifts Photochemical [1,3] shifts Photochemical [1,3] shifts should proceed through suprafacial shifts; however, most are non-concerted because they proceed through a triplet state (i.e., have a diradical mechanism, to which the Woodward-Hoffmann rules do not apply). =[1,5] shifts= A [1,5] shift involves the shift of 1 substituent (hydride, alkyl, or aryl) down 5 atoms of a œÄ system. Hydrogen has been shown to shift in both cyclic and open-chain compounds at temperatures at or above 200 ÀöC. These reactions are predicted to proceed suprafacially, via a H√ºckel- topology transition state. :[1,5] hydride shift in a cyclic system Photoirradiation would require an antarafacial shift of hydrogen. Although rare, there are examples where antarafacial shifts are favored:Kiefer, E.F.; Tana, C.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1969, 91, 4478. :Antarafacial [1,5] hydride shift In contrast to hydrogen [1,5] shifts, there have never been any observed [1,5] alkyl shifts in an open-chain compound. Several studies have, however, been done to determine rate preferences for [1,5] alkyl shifts in cyclic systems: carbonyl and carboxyl> hydride> phenyl and vinyl>> alkyl.Fields, D.J.; Jones, D.W.; Kneen, G. Chemical Communications 1976. 873 ‚Äì 874. Miller, L.L.; Greisinger, R.; Boyer, R.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969. 91. 1578. Alkyl groups undergo [1,5] shifts very poorly, usually requiring high temperatures, however, for cyclohexadiene, the temperature for alkyl shifts isn't much higher than that for carbonyls, the best migratory group. A study showed that this is because alkyl shifts on cyclohexadienes proceed through a different mechanism. First the ring opens, followed by a [1,7] shift, and then the ring reforms electrocyclically:Schiess, P.; Dinkel, R. Tetrahedron Letters, 1975, 16, 29, 2503. :alkyl shift on cyclohexadiene This same mechanistic process is seen below, without the final electrocyclic ring-closing reaction, in the interconversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2. =[1,7] shifts= [1,7] sigmatropic shifts are predicted by the Woodward‚ÄìHoffmann rules to proceed in an antarafacial fashion, via a Mobius topology transition state. An antarafacial [1,7] shift is observed in the conversion of lumisterol to vitamin D2, where following an electrocyclic ring opening to previtamin D2, a methyl hydrogen shifts. :conversion of Lumisterol to Vitamin D2 Bicyclic nonatrienes also undergo [1,7] shifts in a so-called walk rearrangement,Klaerner, F.G. Agnew. Chem. Intl. Ed. Eng., 1972, 11, 832. which is the shift of divalent group, as part of a three-membered ring, in a bicyclic molecule. :walk rearrangement of bicycle nonatriene =[3,3] shifts= [3,3] sigmatropic shifts are well studied sigmatropic rearrangements. The Woodward‚ÄìHoffman rules predict that these six-electron reactions would proceed suprafacially, via a H√ºckel topology transition state. Claisen rearrangement Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen, the Claisen rearrangement is the first recorded example of a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.Claisen, L.; Ber. 1912, 45, 3157. Claisen, L.; Tietze, E.; Chemische Berichte 1925, 58, 275. Claisen, L.; Tietze, E.; Chemische Berichte 1926, 59, 2344. This rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction. An example of Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3] rearrangement of an allyl vinyl ether, which upon heating yields a Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated carbonyl. The formation of a carbonyl group makes this reaction, unlike other sigmatropic rearrangements, inherently irreversible. :The Claisen rearrangement =Aromatic Claisen rearrangement= The ortho-Claisen rearrangement involves the [3,3] shift of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol. :Aromatic Claisen rearrangement When both the ortho positions on the benzene ring are blocked, a second [3,3] rearrangement will occur. This para-Claisen rearrangement ends with the tautomerization to a tri-substituted phenol. :Para-Claisen rearrangement Cope rearrangement The Cope rearrangement is an extensively studied organic reaction involving the [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes.Cope, A. C.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1940, 62, 441. Hoffmann, R.; Stohrer, W. D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971, 93, 25, 6941‚Äì6948. Dupuis, M.; Murray, C.; Davidson, E. R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 26, 9756‚Äì9759. It was developed by Arthur C. Cope. For example, 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene heated to 300 ¬∞C yields 2,6-octadiene. :The Cope rearrangement of 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene =Oxy-Cope rearrangement= In the oxy-Cope rearrangement, a hydroxyl group is added at C3 forming an enal or enone after keto-enol tautomerism of the intermediate enol:Berson, Jerome A.; Jones, Maitland. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964, 86, 22, 5019‚Äì5020. :Oxy-Cope rearrangement Carroll rearrangement The Carroll rearrangement is a rearrangement reaction in organic chemistry and involves the transformation of a Œ≤-keto allyl ester into a Œ±-allyl-Œ≤-ketocarboxylic acid.Carrol, M. F. Journal of the Chemical Society 1940, 704‚Äì706. . This organic reaction is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a Œ≥,Œ¥-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation. :Carroll Rearrangement Fischer indole synthesis The Fischer indole synthesis is a chemical reaction that produces the aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions.Fischer, E.; Jourdan, F. Chemische Berichte 1883, 16, 2241.Fischer, E.; Hess, O. Chemische Berichte 1884, 17, 559. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer. :The Fischer indole synthesis The choice of acid catalyst is very important. Br√∏nsted acids such as HCl, H2SO4, polyphosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid have been used successfully. Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, zinc chloride, iron(III) chloride, and aluminium chloride are also useful catalysts. Several reviews have been published.van Orden, R. B.; Lindwell, H. G. Chem. Rev. 1942, 30, 69‚Äì96. Robinson, B. Chem. Rev. 1963, 63, 373‚Äì401. Robinson, B. Chem. Rev. 1969, 69, 227‚Äì250. =[5,5] Shifts= Similar to [3,3] shifts, the Woodward-Hoffman rules predict that [5,5] sigmatropic shifts would proceed suprafacially, H√ºckel topology transition state. These reactions are rarer than [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, but this is mainly a function of the fact that molecules that can undergo [5,5] shifts are rarer than molecules that can undergo [3,3] shifts. :[5,5] shift of phenyl pentadienyl ether =[2,3] shifts= An example of a 2,3-sigmatropic rearrangement is the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement: :2,3-Wittig rearrangement =Walk rearrangements= The migration of a divalent group, such as O, S, N‚ÄìR, or C‚ÄìR2, which is part of a three-membered ring in a bicyclic molecule, is commonly referred to as a walk rearrangement. This can be formally characterized according to the Woodward-Hofmann rules as being a (1, n) sigmatropic shift.Jensen, F. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1989, 111, 13, 4643 ‚Äì 4647. An example of such a rearrangement is the shift of substituents on tropilidenes (1,3,5-cycloheptatrienes). When heated, the pi-system goes through an electrocyclic ring closing to form bicycle[4,1,0]heptadiene (norcaradiene). Thereafter follows a [1,5] alkyl shift and an electrocyclic ring opening. :norcaradiene rearrangement Proceeding through a [1,5] shift, the walk rearrangement of norcaradienes is expected to proceed suprafacially with a retention of stereochemistry. Experimental observations, however, show that the 1,5-shifts of norcaradienes proceed antarafacially.Klarner, F.G. Topics in Stereochemistry, 1984, 15, 1‚Äì42. Theoretical calculations found the [1,5] shift to be a diradical process, but without involving any diradical minima on the potential energy surface.Kless, A.; Nendel, M.; Wilsey, S.; Houk, K. N. J.

He was a member of Scandal, playing drums on their debut EP, and, at various stages, played the drums with Bon Jovi, David Johansen, Bryan Adams, and John Waite. In the 1990s, he became an A&R; man and producer with his most notable work being with the Spin Doctors on their breakthrough album Pocket Full of Kryptonite. Musical history LaRocka started his career playing drums with David Johansen on Johansen's self-titled album from 1978. He joined Scandal in 1982 and played on their self-titled album of the same year as well as earning credit on John Waite's Ignition album. LaRocka toured with Bryan Adams on his 1983 world tour, and was part of the band when they appeared that year live in concert on the televised Rockpalast show (also broadcast live on European radio). Bon Jovi opened for Scandal in a 1984 tour which led to that band's signing by Polygram Records. La Rocka played drums on their 1984 Bon Jovi album. After parting company with Scandal, he returned to session work playing on sessions by John Waite and in 1985 appearing with him in his band on TV shows like Solid Gold. In the early '90s, LaRocka played drums with Company of Wolves, a straight- ahead rock band signed to Mercury Records. LaRocka also signed a girl group from London called NeverBlue managed by Christopher Waller, Tasha Leaper, Lisa Hurley and Susan Motley. The group worked with Brian Rawlings, famed for Cher's Believe album. NeverBlue was signed to Straight Line Records under Atlantic Records. A&R; and production work LaRocka's first stab at production was with Irish band Silent Running, whom he signed while working in the A&R; department at Atlantic Records. He also played drums on their album Deep. He began working for Sony Music and one of his first signings was the Spin Doctors. He produced their 1991 debut Pocketful of Kryptonite. The album sold slowly at first but it eventually became a hit after their song Little Miss Can't Be Wrong started picking up airplay on MTV and radio. The follow-up single Two Princes was a top ten hit and the album reached a peak of #3 on the Billboard charts in 1993. LaRocka produced subsequent albums for the Spin Doctors but they failed to achieve the same success. LaRocka signed Columbus, Ohio, powerpop band Watershed to Epic Records in 1993.Review of book that documents Franke La Rocka's signing of Watershed Under his supervision, the band recorded one live EP, Three Chords and a Cloud of Dust, and a Jim Steinman-produced album, Twister. Neither effort charted and Watershed was dropped from Epic in 1995. He produced the soundtrack of the 1993 movie Philadelphia. It reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 album chart and featured a top-ten single hit in the Bruce Springsteen song \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\". Springsteen won an Academy Award for Best Song as well as a Golden Globe. Neil Young was also nominated for an Academy Award for his track \\"Philadelphia\\" and the album also featured tracks by Peter Gabriel and the Spin Doctors. By the end of his career at Sony, LaRocka was vice president of the A&R; department. He was back playing drums for a New York band Hot Monkey Love and with Noel Redding on a 2002 live album recorded at Prague. He also had an independent production company, Straight Line Productions, and had signed the band happyendings to J Records where they were recording their debut record. LaRocka died after undergoing heart surgery in New York in May 2005.

The Nightingales) are a British post-punk/alternative rock band, formed in 1979 in Birmingham, England, by four members of Birmingham's punk group The Prefects. They had been part of The Clash's 'White Riot Tour', recorded a couple of Peel Sessions, released a 45 on Rough Trade and, years after splitting up, had a retrospective CD released by New York indie label Acute Records. Described in John Robb's book on 'post punk' Death To Trad Rock as \\"The misfits' misfits\\" and comprising an ever-fluctuating line up, based around lyricist/singer Robert Lloyd, the Nightingales enjoyed cult status in the early 1980s as darlings of the credible music scene and were championed by John Peel, who said of them ‚Äì \\"Their performances will serve to confirm their excellence when we are far enough distanced from the 1980s to look at the period rationally and other, infinitely better known, bands stand revealed as charlatans\\". The original members were Robert Lloyd on vocals, Eamonn Duffy on bass and Paul Apperley on drums, all formerly of The Prefects. The band, before splitting up, played more sessions on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show than any other band excluding The Fall and Half Man Half Biscuit. In the late 1980s, the Nightingales stopped working but, following the occasional gig between times, they re-grouped in 2004, with Lloyd being joined by original Prefects guitarist Alan Apperley. The current line up features Robert Lloyd, James Smith, Andreas Schmid on bass and ex-Violet Violet drummer Fliss Kitson. Since restarting the group have been more productive than ever ‚Äì releasing five 7\\" vinyl singles, a 10\\" EP and six studio albums (plus two live albums), touring England, mainland Europe and US numerous times, recording many radio sessions along the way. They have been invited to play various festivals in Europe and the States, including Glastonbury and SXSW. Their \\"Let's Think About Living\\" 45 was 'Single of the Week' on BBC 6 and they have continued to receive regular rave reviews for their records and live shows. A feature- length documentary about the band - King Rocker - fronted by comedian and writer Stewart Lee and directed by Michael Cumming is to be released in 2020. 1979‚Äì86 Their debut single, \\"Idiot Strength\\" was released in 1981 on Rough Trade, following which Duffy was replaced by Steve Hawkins on bass and Andy Lloyd and Nick Beales joined on guitars. The band signed to Cherry Red Records and released three more singles before debut album Pigs on Purpose (Produced by Richard Strange) was issued in late 1982. John Nester replaced Hawkins on bass before next release, the \\"Urban Ospreys\\" single. Peter Byrchmore replaced Beales (who went on to form Pig Bros) in time for second album, Hysterics (1983), Nester then departed to be replaced by Howard Jenner. The new line-up issued two singles in 1985. Further changes then ensued with Andy Lloyd and Paul Apperley leaving, to be replaced by Maria Smith and Ron Collins. The group continued to release singles, record Peel Sessions and tour northern Europe, as headliners and supporting acts as diverse as Bo Diddley and Nico, but after the third album, In The Good Old Country Way, the band split up in 1986. Post-Nightingales After the split, Robert Lloyd formed a new band, Robert Lloyd & The New Four Seasons, who after a few releases on In Tape Records were signed by Virgin Records. Lloyd recorded one solo album for Virgin, \\"Me and My Mouth\\". Maria and Peter formed The Capitols, later known as The Rotten Swines (Maria was also a member of Rumblefish),\\"Total Namedrop: The Rotten Swines\\", Underground, April 1988, p. 33 Ron Collins joined The Noseflutes, while Andy Lloyd formed Little Red Schoolhouse. Lloyd is currently active in the reformed Nightingales. Peter Byrchmore plays guitar for The Membranes and Goldblade. Nick Beales is in Church of Elvis and Andy Lloyd is in Del Mar Rey. Paul Apperley is now a firefighter. John Nester runs a successful fruit and veg business. Howard Jenner was last heard of working for Help The Aged. Eamonn Duffy, Maria Harvey (formerly Smith) and Ron Collins still live and work in Birmingham. Steve Hawkins' whereabouts are unknown. The Nightingales re-form The band re-grouped in 2004 featuring mainstay/band leader Lloyd, original Prefects guitarist Alan Apperley, ex- Nightingales Byrchmore and Duffy, plus former PWEI drummer Robert \\"Fuzz\\" Townshend. This line-up released four 7-inch singles in 2004/5 before Townshend was replaced by Aaron Moore of Volcano The Bear. Live appearances include radio sessions for Marc Riley's Rocket Science on BBC 6 Music, John Kennedy's XFM show, Terre T's Cherry Blossom Clinic on WFMU (USA) and Another Nice Mess (NL) in addition to gigs around England. The band also played American music festival South By Southwest in March 2005, alongside dates in Chicago and New York City. The band's first American dates ever. Since then they have also played at the Klangbad festival in Germany, organised by Jochen Irmler of Faust, and undertaken a second US tour in March 2007. After several line up changes since reforming, the group line-up settled, for a while, as Robert Lloyd (vocals), Alan Apperley (guitar), ex-Pram drummer Daren Garratt, \\"teenage guitar sensation\\" Matt Wood, and Stephen 'The Night' Lowe (bass). For a brief July‚ÄìAugust 2007 UK and European tour (including a return to the Klangbad Festival on 4 August), Nick Blakey of the Boston, Massachusetts band The in Out substituted for Lowe on bass. The Nightingales released their first studio album for 20 years in early October 2006; Out of True on independent Birmingham label Iron Man Records. A new mini album, What's Not To Love? was released by Caroline True Records on 30 April 2007. In 2007 Lowe left the band and after being replaced briefly by Nick Blakey (who appears on the Live in Paris CD) was replaced by John Roberts. After dates in New York and Boston in March 2008, the group travelled to Faust Studio, Scheer, Germany to record a new album ‚Äì Insult to Injury ‚Äì for Jochen Irmler's Klangbad label. During recording bassist John Roberts left the group. The band played dates in Germany, Switzerland and in Amsterdam, with Christy Edwards of Christy and Emily on bass. Matt Wood left following these dates. For the remainder of 2008 in to 2009 Edwards moved to guitar and Faust Studio engineer Andreas Schmid joined the band on bass. This line up was augmented on various dates in USA and Germany by U.S avant-garde composer Katherine Young on bassoon and Emily Manzo on keyboards. In June 2009, this Nightingales, minus Young, played the John Peel Stage at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK. The seven piece line up also played several festivals in Germany during Summer '09 and recorded \\"The Lost Plot\\" EP and another album but the album recordings remain unreleased. In late 2010, Garratt left the group to be replaced by former Violet Violet drummer, Fliss Kitson. Being based in New York also relegated Edwards to an occasional guest Nightingale and guitarist Matt Wood rejoined the band. A return to Faust Studio in 2011 saw the Nightingales record the No Love Lost album, which was released by Cooking Vinyl in early 2012. Described by Mojo magazine as \\"Brilliant. One of the fiercest and most exhilarating rock records in ages\\", the record features guests Young on bassoon and Hans-Joachim Irmler on keyboards. Wood left the band for the second time shortly after recording the album and has since joined Telegram. In May 2011, the Nightingales played at The New Adelphi Club in Hull, East Yorkshire. Robert Lloyd The new four piece Nightingales ‚Äì Lloyd, Apperley, Schmid and Kitson ‚Äì recorded another album For Fucks Sake in September 2013 for vinyl LP release in April 2014. The band's press statement for this record said, \\"Having been dumped by their fourth consecutive label, following the release of one album each, the group are self releasing the new LP on their own terms.

The Notman House in Montreal was his home from 1876 until his death in 1891 and has since been named after him. Biography Five men curling (albumen print) The National Galleries of Scotland Notman was born in Paisley, Scotland, in 1826, and moved to Montreal in the summer of 1856. An amateur photographer, he quickly established a flourishing professional photography studio on Bleury Street, a location close to Montreal's central commercial district. His first important commission was the documentation of the construction of the Victoria Bridge across the St. Lawrence River. The Bridge opened with great fanfare in 1860, attended by the Prince of Wales and Notman's camera. The gift to the Prince of a Maple Box containing Notman's photographs of the construction of the bridge and scenes of Canada East and Canada West so pleased Queen Victoria that, according to family tradition, she named him \\"Photographer to the Queen.\\" The first Canadian photographer with an international reputation, Notman's status and business grew over the next three decades. He established branches throughout Canada and the United States, including seasonal branches at Yale and Harvard universities to cater to the student trade. Notman was also an active member of the Montreal artistic community, opening his studio for exhibitions by local painters; the studio also provided training for aspiring photographers and painters. Notman was highly regarded by his colleagues for his innovative photography, and held patents for some of the techniques he developed to recreate winter within the studio walls. He won medals at exhibitions in Montreal, London, Paris, and Australia. Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, February 1899. The carefully prepared composite photograph was a Notman specialty Photography during the mid-19th century was not the simple process it later became. The typical tourist generally did not carry a camera and much of the Notman studio's images were taken with the tourist's needs in mind. Visitors would look through Notman's picture books and chose views, to buy individually mounted or perhaps made up into an album, and have a portrait taken as well. Street scenes in the burgeoning cities of Canada, the magnificence of modern transportation by rail and steam, expansive landscapes and the natural wonders, were all in demand either as 8\\" x 10\\" print, or in the popular stereographic form, and were duly recorded by the many staff photographers working for the Notman studio. He was a regular contributor to the photographic journal Philadelphia Photographer and in partnership with its editor, Edward Wilson, formed the Centennial Photographic Company for the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, held in honour of the 100th anniversary of the United States in 1876. He won the only gold medal to be awarded by the British judges and the portrait identification card required for entrance to the grounds was the ancestor of today's various photo-ID cards. When William Notman died suddenly in November 1891 after a short bout of pneumonia, management of the studio Wm Notman & Son was left to his son William McFarlane Notman, an experienced photographer in his own right, who with his brothers, had accompanied the itinerant settlement known as \\"End of Track\\" for the Canadian Pacific Railway and documented the completion of the railway in Western Canada. Legacy At Notman's death, his eldest son and partner, William McFarlane Notman, inherited the company. When William McFarlane Notman died of cancer in 1913, his younger brother Charles assumed responsibility. In 1935, Charles retired and sold the studio to the Associated Screen News, In 1957, the Notman Collection was purchased by McGill University. The 200,000 negatives, 43 Index Books, 200 Picture Books and assorted memorabilia were transferred to the McCord Museum of Canadian History. The Notman Photographic Archives was created with the addition of the McCord Museum's existing photographic holdings to the Notman Collection, and the Notman Collection served as the kernel for an extensive Canadian photography department, covering Canada from Newfoundland to Victoria, the Great Lakes to the Arctic, from 1841 to 1935. His residence from 1876 until his death, Notman House in Montreal was added to the R√©pertoire du patrimoine culturel du Qu√©bec historic registry on 8 December 1979.

Although the definitive pathologic process is poorly understood, there are several hypotheses: *Intra- or extravascular nitrogen in bones, \\"nitrogen embolism\\". *Osmotic gas effects due to intramedullary pressure effects. *fat embolism *hemoconcentration and increased coagulability. Presentation The lesion begins as a localised area of infarction, usually without symptoms. Early identification of lesions by radiography is not possible, but over time areas of radiographic opacity develop in association with the damaged bone. Symptomatic lesions usually involve joint surfaces, and fracture where attempted healing occurs. This process takes place over months to years and eventually causes disabling arthritis, particularly of the femoral head (hip). Dysbaric osteonecrosis lesions are typically bilateral and usually occur at both ends of the femur and at the proximal end of the humerus Symptoms are usually only present when a joint surface is involved, which typically does not occur until a long time after the causative exposure to a hyperbaric environment. The initial damage is attributed to the formation of bubbles, and one episode can be sufficient, however incidence is sporadic and generally associated with relatively long periods of hyperbaric exposure and aetiology is uncertain. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made by x-ray/MRI appearance and has five juxta-articular classifications and forehead, neck, and shaft classifications indicating early radiological signs. Early on there is flattening of articular surfaces, thinning of cartilage with osteophyte (spur) formation. In juxta-articular lesions without symptoms, there is dead bone and marrow separated from living bone by a line of dense collagen. Microscopic cysts form, fill with necrotic material and there is massive necrosis with replacement by cancellous bone with collapse of the lesions. The following staging system is sometimes useful when managing lesions. * Stage 0 - Intravascular coagulation * Stage 1 - Dead Bone without repair * Stage 2 - Dead Bone with repair but without collapse * Stage 3 - Dead Bone with repair and with collapse * Stage 4 - Secondary degenerative arthritis In a study of bone lesions in 281 compressed air workers done by Walder in 1969, 29% of the lesions were in the humeral head (shoulder), 16% in the femoral head (hip), 40% in the lower end of the femur (lower thigh at the knee) and 15% in the upper tibia (knee below the knee cap). Worsening of the condition from continued decompression in an asymptomatic x-ray finding may occur. Prevention Prevention is a more successful strategy than treatment. By using the most conservative decompression schedule reasonably practicable, and by minimizing the number of major decompression exposures, the risk of DON may be reduced. Prompt treatment of any symptoms of decompression sickness (DCS) with recompression and hyperbaric oxygen also reduce the risk of subsequent DON. Treatment Treatment is difficult, often requiring a joint replacement. Spontaneous improvement occasionally happens and some juxta-articular lesions do not progress to collapse. Other treatments include immobilization and osteotomy of the femur. Cancellous bone grafts are of little help. Prognosis If the diver has not been exposed to excessive depth and decompression and presents as DON, there may be a predisposition for the condition. Diving should be restricted to shallow depths. Divers who have suffered from DON are at increased risk of future fracture of a juxta-articular lesion during a dive, and may face complications with future joint replacements. Because of the young age of the population normally affected, little data is available regarding joint replacement complications. There is the potential for worsening of DON for any diving where there might be a need for decompression, experimental or helium diving. Physically stressful diving should probably be restricted, both in sport diving and work diving due to the possibility of unnecessary stress to the joint. Any diving should be less than 40 feet/12 meters. These risks are affected by the degree of disability and by the type of lesion (juxta-articular or shaft). Prevalence Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a significant occupational hazard, occurring in 50% of commercial Japanese divers, 65% of Hawaiian fishermen and 16% of commercial and caisson divers in the UK. Its relationship to compressed air is strong in that it may follow a single exposure to compressed air, may occur with no history of DCS but is usually associated with significant compressed air exposure. The distribution of lesions differs with the type of exposure - the juxta-articular lesions being more common in caisson workers than in divers. There is a definite relationship between length of time exposed to extreme depths and the percentage of divers with bone lesions. Evidence does not suggest that dysbaric osteonecrosis is a significant risk in recreational scuba diving.

Established as a monastic church in the thirteenth century, it became a parish church after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Following its destruction in the Great Fire of London of 1666, it was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. Except for the tower, the church was largely destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The decision was made not to rebuild the church; the ruins are now a public garden. History =Gothic church= Christ Church Greyfriars had its origins in the conventual church of a Franciscan monastery, the name 'Greyfriars' being a reference to the grey habits worn by Franciscan friars. The first church on the site was built in the mid-thirteenth century, but this was soon replaced by a much larger building, begun in the 1290s and finished in about 1360. This new church was the second largest in medieval London, measuring long and wide,Bradley/Pevsner, London: The City Churches p. 53. with at least eleven altars. It was built partly at the expense of Marguerite of France, second wife of King Edward I. She was buried at the church, as was Isabella, widow of Edward II and her daughter Joan of the Tower, Queen of Scotland. The heart of Eleanor of Provence, wife of Henry III, was also interred there. Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor of London, founded a library in connection with the church in 1429. The monastery was dissolved in 1538 during the English Reformation. The building and fittings suffered heavy damage in this period. Tombs disappeared, sold for their marble and other valuable materials; monuments were defaced.\\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\\" Tucker, T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 In 1546, Henry VIII gave the priory and its church, along with the churches of St Nicholas Shambles and St Ewin, Newgate Market, to the City Corporation. A new parish of Christ Church was created, incorporating those of St Nicholas and St Ewin, and part of that of St Sepulchre. The priory buildings later housed Christ's Hospital school, founded by Edward VI, and the church became its pupils' principal place of worship. In the 1640s Christ Church was the church of the Presbyterian polemicist Thomas Edwards, and during May 1647 became a centre of operations for attempts to disband and pay arrears to members of the New Model Army.Michael Braddick, God's Fury, England's Fire: A new history of the English Civil Wars, London, Allen Lane, 2008, p493 =Wren's church= Christ Church as depicted in an 1845 edition of the Illustrated London News. The medieval church was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Reconstruction was assigned to Wren, who oversaw a decades long-programme that rebuilt St. Paul's Cathedral and approximately 50 parish churches in the fire zone. There appears to have been some debate about the form the new Christ Church should take. A surviving unused design shows a structure considerably larger than what was eventually built. The parish was united with that of St Leonard, Foster Lane, which was not rebuilt Parishioners raised ¬£1,000 to begin work on the design that in the end was selected. To save time and money, the foundations of the gothic church were partially reused. The new church and tower (without steeple) were completed in 1687,\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p69:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 at a total cost of ¬£11,778 9s. 7¬ºd.Jeffery, The City Churches of Sir Christopher Wren p. 191. Smaller than the gothic structure, the building measured long and wide, occupying only the eastern end of the site of the medieval church, the western part becoming its churchyard. The tower, rising from the west end of the church, had a simple round-arched main entranceway and, above, windows decorated with neoclassical pediments. Large carved pineapples, symbols of welcome, graced the four roof corners of the main church structure. Unique among the Wren churches, the east and west walls had buttresses. The interior was divided into nave and aisles by Corinthian columns, raised on tall plinths so that their bases were level with the gallery floors. The aisles had flat ceilings, while the nave had a shallow cross-vault. The north and south walls had large round-arched windows of clear glass, which allowed for a brightly lit interior. The east end had trinity windows, a large wooden altar screen and a carved hexagonal pulpit, reached by stairs. There was elaborate carved wainscoting. A pavement of reddish brown and grey marble to the west of the altar rails was said to date from the original gothic church. Galleries stood over the north and south aisles, built at special request of the officers of Christ's Hospital as seating for the school's students. Pews were said to have been made from the timbers of a wrecked Spanish galleon. The organ, on the west wall over the main nave door, was built by Renatus Harris in 1690, according to a pre-war guide to the church. The steeple, standing about tall, was finished in 1704 at an additional cost of ¬£1,963, 8s. 3¬Ω d. It has three diminishing storeys, square in plan, the middle one with a freestanding Ionic colonnade. Over the course of the church‚Äôs existence, significant modifications were made. In 1760, a vestry house was built against the facade‚Äôs south side and part of the church's south wall. At some point, rooms were enclosed in the north and south aisles beneath the galleries. Stained glass depicting Jesus with the children was installed in the centre trinity window to replace the original clear glass. The church functioned as an important centre of City of London society and music. The Lord Mayor attended an annual service to hear the Ancient Spital Sermon on the second Wednesday after Easter, placing his ceremonial sword in a special holder. Felix Mendelssohn played Bach's A minor fugue and other works on the organ in 1837. Samuel Wesley also performed at the church. The Christ's Hospital boys continued to attend services, sitting in the galleries. According to the pre-war guide book to the church, they included the young Samuel Coleridge and Charles Lamb. Sixth Form boys tasked with maintaining order sat in special seats placed over those of the younger students. A few boys carved initials in the woodwork. =Decline of the congregation= In 1902 Christ's Hospital moved out of the City to Horsham, West Sussex, ending the Sunday influx of its schoolboys. A new vicar, T.R. Hine-Haycock, took over in 1912. A July 1922 Christ Church newsletter preserved at Guildhall Library shows that at that time it had an 8:30 a.m. Holy Communion service every Sunday, and musical services at 11 a.m. every first and third Sunday.The church was open daily for private prayer from noon to 3 p.m. In its final years, the congregation continued to drop in size, a common trend for City churches as people relocated to suburban neighbourhoods of London. Parish records at the Guildhall Library show there were 112 members in April 1933, mostly residents of places outside the parish boundaries. Many of those who made their homes in the parish were \\"housekeepers\\", people who lived in and looked after commercial buildings. In April 1937, the membership had dropped to 77. =Destruction= The church was severely damaged in the Blitz on 29 December 1940. During one of the Second World War's fiercest air raids on London, a firebomb struck the roof and tore into the nave.Bell and Reynes, Christchurch, Newgate Street: Its History and Architecture p. 33. Much of the surrounding neighbourhood was also set alight‚Äîa total of eight Wren churches burned that night. At Christ Church, the only fitting known to have been saved was the cover of the finely carved wooden font, recovered by an unknown fireman who ran inside as the flames raged. The roof and vaulting collapsed into the nave; the tower and four main walls, made of stone, remained standing but were smoke-scarred and gravely weakened. A photograph taken the following day shows two firemen hosing down smouldering rubble in the nave. =Post-war period= In 1944, The Times wrote about the ruins of Christ Church In 1949, in a reorganisation of Church of England parishes in London, authorities decided not to rebuild Christ Church. The remains of the church were designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. In 1954, the Christ Church parish was merged with that of the nearby St Sepulchre- without-Newgate. Christ Church Greyfriars, neo-Georgian brick offices The steeple, still standing after the wartime damage, was disassembled in 1960 and put back together using modern construction methods. The surviving lower part of the south wall and the entire east wall were demolished in 1962 to make way for a widening of King Edward Street. In 1981, neo-Georgian brick offices were constructed against the southwest corner of the ruins, in imitation of the 1760 vestry house that had stood there. In 1989, the former nave area became a public garden and memorial.Bradley/Pevsner, London: The City Churches p. 54. The tower's lowers levels functioned as commercial rental space. In 2002, the financial firm Merrill Lynch completed a regional headquarters complex on land abutting to the north and the west. In conjunction with that project, the Christ Church site underwent a major renovation and archeological examination, King Edward Street was returned to its former course, and the site of the church regained its pre-war footprint. The churchyard was spruced up and its metal railings restored. In 2006, work was completed to convert the tower and spire into a modern twelve-level private residence. The nave area continues as a memorial; the wooden font cover, topped by a carved angel, can today be seen in the porch of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

Biography Rysanek was born in Vienna and made her operatic debut in 1949 in Innsbruck. In 1951 the Bayreuth Festival reopened and the new leader Wieland Wagner asked her to sing Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre. He was convinced that her unique, young and beautiful voice, combined with her rare acting abilities, would create a sensation. She became a star overnight, and the role of Sieglinde followed her for the rest of her career. Her final performance was at the Salzburg Festival in August 1996, as Klyt√§mnestra in Elektra by Richard Strauss. Her Metropolitan Opera debut came in 1959 as Lady Macbeth in Verdi's Macbeth, replacing Maria Callas who had been \\"fired\\" from the production. Over her lengthy career, she sang 299 performances of 24 roles there. She starred in productions of Verdi's Nabucco, in the title role of Ariadne auf Naxos by Richard Strauss, the Empress in Die Frau ohne Schatten, also by Strauss, and Jan√°ƒçek's K√°≈•a Kabanov√°. She made her farewell there as the Countess in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades in January 1996. She was appointed curator of the Vienna Festival a few months after her retirement, a post she held until her death in Vienna at age 71 (she had been diagnosed with bone cancer during her last Met performances). Two days later, a Metropolitan Opera production of Wagner's Lohengrin with Ben Heppner in the title role was dedicated to her memory. In that opera, she had sung the role of Ortrud in the 1985-86 production. Voice and roles Leonie Rysanek's voice was astride the spinto and dramatic soprano voices in certain roles. Although her voice fell in the upper end of the jugendlich-dramatisch and dramatischer Sopran categories in the German repertoire, it was exclusively dramatic by Italian operatic standards. In the octave just above middle C, the voice could occasionally sound dry with wobbly intonation, but at the top of the staff it blossomed into one of the most glorious sounds of the twentieth century. Her endurance in the high tessitura of Strauss' operas is legendary. She excelled in the music of Richard Strauss. She was especially successful as the Empress (Kaiserin) in Die Frau ohne Schatten, the title role in Salome, the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier and Chrysothemis in Elektra. She occasionally sang Ariadne/Prima Donna in Ariadne auf Naxos and female leads in Strauss operas rarely staged (Die √§gyptische Helena and Die Liebe der Danae). However, cautious of playing out of her league, she didn't tackle Salome until 1972 when she was age 46, although she kept the role of Sieglinde in her active repertoire from her early 20s until age 62. She avoided offers to sing Isolde in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde despite speculation that the role would be perfect for her. She sang Br√ºnnhilde in Die Walk√ºre in 1950 in Innsbruck but did not return to this role. She stated in interviews that her great respect for her colleague Birgit Nilsson was a factor in her avoidance of that soprano's signature roles. Extraordinarily, one of her performances in Die Walk√ºre took place in the same week as her appearance as Gilda in Rigoletto. This little-known feat equals the more often cited accomplishment of Maria Callas, who once performed Die Walk√ºre and Bellini's I puritani within the same week. Strauss sopranos often make excellent Puccini voices and accordingly Rysanek sang the title role of Tosca often, and of Turandot a few times. She also sang a remarkable Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio. In Wagner, she sang Elisabeth in Tannh√§user often, also Elsa and Ortrud in Lohengrin. She virtually \\"owned\\" the role of Senta in Der fliegende Holl√§nder for two decades, but the role in which she was most revered, in addition to Strauss's Kaiserin and Chrysothemis, was Sieglinde in Die Walk√ºre. Such a powerful, well-projected, and expressive voice as Rysanek's allowed her to sing many Verdi leads, notably Desdemona in Otello, Lady Macbeth, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera, Elisabetta in Don Carlo, Leonora in La forza del destino, and the title role of Aida. She also sang Abigaille in the Metropolitan Opera's first staging of Nabucco in 1960. She found this last role uncongenial, and the strain of performing it numerous times during that season brought on something of a vocal crisis, from which she successfully recovered. The overall nature of Rysanek's voice is particularly evident in her 1959 recording of Lady Macbeth, when she was in her prime at age 33, where her somewhat hollow lower register is combined with soaring, dramatic power in her upper range, with strong skills at negotiating Lady Macbeth's upper range coloratura. As an Austrian and a Mitteleurop√§erin, Rysanek also took an interest in music from Slavic countries, both Russian (Tchaikovsky) and Czech (Smetana, Jan√°ƒçek). Of the notorious five \\"biggest\\" soprano roles, Rysanek sang Turandot and enjoyed success as Kundry in Parsifal at the Met, Vienna, and the Bayreuth Festival. Starting her career when Kirsten Flagstad was still alive and Birgit Nilsson and Astrid Varnay at the peak of their vocal abilities, Rysanek knew better than to go for Wagner's Isolde or any of his three Br√ºnnhildes. However, in 1981, Karl B√∂hm persuaded her to sing Elektra for a Unitel film (with the soundtrack recorded in the studio), not a live production in an opera house. In her later years, and like many \\"big\\" soprano voices, Rysanek reverted to dramatic mezzo-soprano roles like Herodias in Salome, Klytemnestra in Elektra and the Kostelniƒçka in Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa.

Diving medicine, also called undersea and hyperbaric medicine (UHB), is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions caused by humans entering the undersea environment. It includes the effects on the body of pressure on gases, the diagnosis and treatment of conditions caused by marine hazards and how relationships of a diver's fitness to dive affect a diver's safety. Diving medical practitioners are also expected to be competent in the examination of divers and potential divers to determine fitness to dive. Hyperbaric medicine is a corollary field associated with diving, since recompression in a hyperbaric chamber is used as a treatment for two of the most significant diving-related illnesses, decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Diving medicine deals with medical research on issues of diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accidents and diving fitness. The field includes the effect of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure on the human body and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and at first aid level, an important part of diver education.  Range and scope of diving medicine  The scope of diving medicine must necessarily include conditions that are specifically connected with the activity of diving, and not found in other contexts, but this categorization excludes almost everything, leaving only deep water blackout, isobaric counterdiffusion and high pressure nervous syndrome. A more useful grouping is conditions that are associated with exposure to variations of ambient pressure. These conditions are largely shared by aviation and space medicine. Further conditions associated with diving and other aquatic and outdoor activities are commonly included in books which are aimed at the diver, rather than the specialist medical practitioner, as they are useful background to diver first aid training. The scope of knowledge necessary for a practitioner of diving medicine includes the medical conditions associated with diving and their treatment, physics and physiology relating to the underwater and pressurised environment, the standard operating procedures and equipment used by divers which can influence the development and management of these conditions, and the specialised equipment used for treatment. = Scope of knowledge for diving medicine = The ECHM-EDTC Educational and Training Standards for Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine (2011) specify the following scope of knowledge for Diving Medicine: * Physiology and pathology of diving and hyperbaric exposure. ** Hyperbaric physics ** Diving related physiology ** Hyperbaric pathophysiology of immersion ** Pathophysiology of decompression ** A brief introduction to acute dysbaric disorders ** Chronic dysbaric disorders ** Hyperbaric oxygen therapy basis - Physiology and pathology ** Oxygen toxicity ** Pressure and inert gas effects *** Nitrogen narcosis *** High pressure neurological syndrome ** Medication under pressure ** Non-dysbaric diving pathologies * Diving technology and safety ** Basic safety planning ** Compressed air work ** Diving procedures *** Wet bells and stages *** Scuba diving on air and mixed gas *** Surface supplied diving *** Standard diving (copper helmet) *** Rebreather diving (semi-closed and closed circuit) *** Other diving procedures ** Characteristics of various divers ** Diving equipment as used to c.50m and Chambers ** Diving tables and computers ** Regulations and standards for diving ** Saturation diving *** Saturation mode *** Physiology of deep exposure *** Compression *** At depth in a living chamber *** Bell excursions * Fitness to dive ** Fitness to dive criteria and contraindications for divers, compressed air workers and HBOT chamber personnel ** Fitness to dive assessment ** Fitness to dive standards (professional and recreational) * Diving accidents ** Diving incidents and accidents ** Emergency medical support with no chamber on site *** Barotrauma: ENT; dental; cutaneous, conjunctival, etc. *** Physical injuries ** Decompression illness *** Pathophysiological basis and mechanisms of DCI *** Differential diagnosis of decompression illness *** Management of decompression incidents at the surface *** Immediate management, recompression tables and strategies ** Rehabilitation of disabled divers ** Diving accident investigation * Clinical HBO ** Recompression chambers = Scope of knowledge for hyperbaric medicine = The ECHM-EDTC Educational and Training Standards for Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine (2011) specify the following scope of knowledge for Hyperbaric Medicine additional to that for Diving medicine: * Physiology and pathology of diving and hyperbaric exposure. ** HBO-Basics - effects of hyperbaric oxygen - physiology and pathology * Clinical HBO ** Chamber technique (multiplace, monoplace, transport chambers, wet recompression) ** Mandatory indications ** HBO Recommended indications ** HBO Experimental and anecdotal indications ** HBO Data collection / statistics / evaluation ** HBO General basic treatment (nursing) ** HBO Diagnostic, monitoring and therapeutic devices in chambers ** Risk assessment, incidents monitoring and safety plan in HBO chambers ** HBO Safety regulations  Diagnostics  The signs and symptoms of diving disorders may present during a dive, on surfacing, or up to several hours after a dive. Divers have to breathe a gas which is at the same pressure as their surroundings, which can be much greater than on the surface. The ambient pressure underwater increases by for every of depth. The principal conditions are: decompression illness (which covers decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although some of these may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities. The disorders are caused by breathing gas at the high pressures encountered at depth, and divers will often breathe a gas mixture different from air to mitigate these effects. Nitrox, which contains more oxygen and less nitrogen is commonly used as a breathing gas to reduce the risk of decompression sickness at recreational depths (up to about ). Helium may be added to reduce the amount of nitrogen and oxygen in the gas mixture when diving deeper, to reduce the effects of narcosis and to avoid the risk of oxygen toxicity. This is complicated at depths beyond about , because a helium‚Äìoxygen mixture (heliox) then causes high pressure nervous syndrome. More exotic mixtures such as hydreliox, a hydrogen‚Äìhelium‚Äìoxygen mixture, are used at extreme depths to counteract this. = Decompression sickness = Decompression sickness (DCS) occurs when gas, which has been breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. = Pulmonary barotrauma and arterial gas embolism = If the breathing gas in a diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, the lungs may be expanded beyond their compliance, and the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The gas may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. = Nitrogen narcosis = Nitrogen narcosis is caused by the pressure of dissolved gas in the body and produces temporary impairment to the nervous system. This results in alteration to thought processes and a decrease in the diver's ability to make judgements or calculations. It can also decrease motor skills, and worsen performance in tasks requiring manual dexterity. As depth increases, so does the pressure and hence the severity of the narcosis. The effects may vary widely from individual to individual, and from day to day for the same diver. Because of the perception-altering effects of narcosis, a diver may not be aware of the symptoms, but studies have shown that impairment occurs nevertheless. The narcotic effects dissipate without lasting effect as the pressure decreases during ascent. = High-pressure nervous syndrome = Helium is the least narcotic of all gases, and divers may use breathing mixtures containing a proportion of helium for dives exceeding about deep. In the 1960s it was expected that helium narcosis would begin to become apparent at depths of . However, it was found that different symptoms, such as tremors, occurred at shallower depths around . This became known as high-pressure nervous syndrome, and its effects are found to result from both the absolute depth and the speed of descent. Although the effects vary from person to person, they are stable and reproducible for the individual. = Oxygen toxicity = Although oxygen is essential to life, in concentrations significantly greater than normal it becomes toxic, overcoming the body's natural defences (antioxidants), and causing cell death in any part of the body. The lungs and brain are particularly affected by high partial pressures of oxygen, such as are encountered in diving. The body can tolerate partial pressures of oxygen around indefinitely, and up to for many hours, but higher partial pressures rapidly increase the chance of the most dangerous effect of oxygen toxicity, a convulsion resembling an epileptic seizure. Susceptibility to oxygen toxicity varies dramatically from person to person, and to a smaller extent from day to day for the same diver. Prior to convulsion, several symptoms may be present ‚Äì most distinctly that of an aura.  Treatments  Treatment of diving disorders depends on the specific disorder or combination of disorders, but two treatments are commonly associated with first aid and definitive treatment where diving is involved. These are first aid oxygen administration at high concentration, which is seldom contraindicated, and generally recommended as a default option in diving accidents where there is any significant probability of hypoxia, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which is the definitive treatment for most incidences of decompression illness. Hyperbaric treatment using other breathing gases is also used for treatment of decompression sickness if HBO is inadequate. = Oxygen therapy = The administration of oxygen as a medical intervention is common in diving medicine, both for first aid and for longer term treatment. Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues. There is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database. = Recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy = Recompression treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was initially used as a life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness. Now, it is a highly specialized treatment modality that has been found to be effective in the treatment of many conditions where the administration of oxygen under pressure has been found to be beneficial. Studies have shown it to be quite effective in some 13 indications approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is generally preferred when effective, as it is usually a more efficient and lower risk method of reducing symptoms of decompression illness, but in some cases recompression to pressures where oxygen toxicity is unacceptable may be required to eliminate the bubbles in the tissues in severe cases of decompression illness. Medical examination for fitness to dive Fitness to dive, (or medical fitness to dive), is the medical and physical suitability of a person to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver that he or she does not suffer from any of the listed disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, to a detailed medical examination by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a procedural checklist, and a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner. The most important medical examination is the one before starting diving, as the diver can be screened to prevent exposure when a dangerous condition exists. The other important medicals are after some significant illness, where medical intervention is needed there and has to be done by a doctor who is competent in diving medicine, and can not be done by prescriptive rules. Psychological factors can affect fitness to dive, particularly where they affect response to emergencies, or risk taking behaviour. The use of medical and recreational drugs, can also influence fitness to dive, both for physiological and behavioural reasons. In some cases prescription drug use may have a net positive effect, when effectively treating an underlying condition, but frequently the side effects of effective medication may have undesirable influences on the fitness of diver, and most cases of recreational drug use result in an impaired fitness to dive, and a significantly increased risk of sub-optimal response to emergencies.  Education and registration of practitioners  Specialist training in underwater and hyperbaric medicine is available from several institutions, and registration is possible both with professional associations and governmental registries. = Education = = Registration = The American Medical Association recognises the sub-speciality Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine held by someone who is already Board Certified in some other speciality. The South African Department of Employment and Labour registers two levels of Diving Medical Practitioner. Level 1 is qualified to conduct annual examinations and certification of medical fitness to dive, on commercial divers (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 1. Medical Examiner of Divers), and Level 2 is qualified to provide medical advice to a diving contractor and hyperbaric treatment for diving injuries (equivalent to ECHM-EDTC Level 2D Diving Medicine Physician) Australia has a four tier system: In 2007 there was no recognised equivalence with the European standard. * GPs completing the first tier four- to five-day course on how to examine divers for ‚Äòfitness to dive‚Äô can then add their names to the SPUMS Diving Doctors List * GPs completing the second tier two-week diving medicine courses provided by the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Adelaide Hospital, or the two-week course in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine provided by the ANZ Hyperbaric Medicine Group, qualify to do commercial-diving medicals. * The third tier is the SPUMS Diploma in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. The candidate must attend a two- week course, write a dissertation related to DHM and have the equivalent of six months‚Äô full-time experience working in a hyperbaric medicine unit. * The fourth tier is the Certificate in Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine from the ANZ College of Anaesthetists.  Training of divers and support staff in relevant first aid  = Divers = A basic knowledge understanding of the causes, symptoms and first aid treatment of diving related disorders is part of the basic training for most recreational and professional divers, both to help the diver avoid the disorders, and to allow appropriate action in case of an incident resulting in injury.  Recreational divers  A recreational diver has the same duty of care to other divers as any ordinary member of the public, and therefore there is no obligation to train recreational divers in first aid or other medical skills. Nevertheless, first aid training is recommended by most, if not all, recreational diver training agencies.Staff, National Association of Underwater Instructors, Scuba rescue diver specialty, http://www.naui.org/specialty_courses.aspx#040 Staff, British Sub-Aqua Club, First Aid for Divers, http://www.bsac.com/page.asp?section=3606&sectionTitle;=First+Aid+for+DiversCMAS Rescue diver training standard, http://www.cmas.org/technique/rescue-diver- training-programme Recreational diving instructors and divemasters, on the other hand, are to a greater or lesser extent responsible for the safety of divers under their guidance, and therefore are generally required to be trained and certified to some level of rescue and first aid competence, as defined in the relevant training standards of the certifying body. In many cases this includes certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first aid oxygen administration for diving accidents.  Professional divers  Professional divers usually operate as members of a team with a duty of care for other members of the team. Divers are expected to act as standby divers for other members of the team and the duties of a standby diver include rescue attempts if the working diver gets into difficulties. Consequently, professional divers are generally required to be trained in rescue procedures appropriate to the modes of diving they are certified in, and to administer first aid in emergencies. The specific training, competence and registration for these skills varies, and may be specified by state or national legislation or by industry codes of practice.The Diving Medical Advisory Committee DMAC, November 2001, Provision of First Aid and the Training of Divers, Supervisors and Members of Dive Teams in First Aid, DMAC 11 Rev. 1, Diving supervisors have a similar duty of care, and as they are responsible for operational planning and safety, generally are also expected to manage emergency procedures, including the first aid that may be required. The level of first aid training, competence and certification will generally take this into account. * In South Africa, registered commercial and scientific divers must hold current certification in first aid at the national Level 1, with additional training in oxygen administration for diving accidents, and registered diving supervisors must hold Level 2 first aid certification. * Offshore diving contractors frequently follow the IMCA recommendations. = Diver Medic = A diver medic or diving medical technician (DMT) is a member of a dive team who is trained in advanced first aid. A Diver Medic recognised by IMCA must be capable of administering First Aid and emergency treatment, and carrying out the directions of a doctor pending the arrival of more skilled medical aid, and therefore must be able to effectively communicate with a doctor who is not on site, and be familiar with diving procedures and compression chamber operation. The Diver Medic must also be able to assist the diving supervisor with decompression procedures provide advice as to when more specialised medical help should be requested, and must be fit to provide treatment in a hyperbaric chamber in an emergency, and must therefore hold a valid certificate of medical fitness to dive. Training standards for Diver Medic are described in the IMCA Scheme for Recognition of Diver Medic Training.  Ethical and medicolegal issues  Experimental work on human subjects is often ethically and/or legally impracticable. Tests where the endpoint is symptomatic decompression sickness are difficult to authorise and this makes the accumulation of adequate and statistically valid data difficult. The precautionary principle may be applied in the absence of information allowing a realistic assessment of risk. Analysis of investigations into accidents is useful when reliable results are available, which is less often than would be desirable, but privacy concerns prevent a large mount of information potentially useful to the general diving population from being made available to researchers.

VECSELs are used primarily as near infrared devices in laser cooling and spectroscopy, but have also been explored for applications such as telecommunications. Comparisons with VCSELs Unlike a VCSEL, in which two high-reflecting mirrors are incorporated into the laser structure to form the optical cavity, in a VECSEL one of the two mirrors is external to the diode structure. As a result, the cavity includes a free-space region. A typical distance from the diode to the external mirror would be 1 cm. Several workers demonstrated optically pumped VECSELs, and they continue to be developed for many applications including very high power diode laser sources for use in industrial machining (cutting, punching, etc.) because of their unusually high power (see below) and efficiency when pumped by multi-mode diode laser bars. These lasers are in the process of challenging conventional high power lasers such as solid state (e.g., Nd:YAG) and carbon dioxide lasers for machining operations. However, electrically pumped VECSELs (another matter entirely), were the brainchild of Aram Mooradian, an engineer known for fundamental contributions to diode laser linewidth studies, who worked for many years at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. Mooradian formed a company, Novalux, Inc., which was the first to demonstrate VECSELs (which they called \\"NECSELs\\"). Applications for electrically pumped VECSELs include frequency doubling of near-IR VECSEL emitters to attain compact powerful sources of single-mode blue and green light for projection display purposes. Semiconductor gain One of the most interesting features of any VECSEL is the thinness of the semiconductor gain region in the direction of propagation, less than 100 nm. In contrast, a conventional in-plane semiconductor laser entails light propagation over distances of from 250 Œºm upward to 2 mm or longer. The significance of the short propagation distance is that it minimizes the effect of \\"antiguiding\\" nonlinearities (the same phenomenon is coincidentally quantified by the linewidth enhancement factor relating to Mooradian's above-mentioned earlier work) in the diode laser gain region. The result is a large-cross-section single-mode optical beam which is not attainable from in-plane (a.k.a. \\"edge-emitting\\") diode lasers. In a VECSEL, the external mirror permits a significantly greater area of the diode to participate in generating light in a single mode, resulting in much higher power than otherwise attainable. Monolithic VCSELs emit powers in the low milliwatt range. By contrast, at the 2004 Optical Society of America \\"Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics,\\" held in San Francisco, California, one company (Coherent, Inc.) announced 45 watt continuous wave single-mode emission from an optically pumped VECSEL. Numerous other companies and organizations worldwide have adopted the optically pumped architecture for its simplicity.

He was the sixth son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo. As children, he and his brothers Yoritomo and Yoshitsune were spared by Taira no Kiyomori in 1160, following the death of their father, after their mother Tokiwa became Kiyomori's concubine. Noriyori seemingly disappears from any record until 1180, when he served his brother Yoritomo in Kamakura. Beginning in 1184, four years into the Genpei War, he was sent out from Kamakura by Yoritomo, and made his way to the Taira strongholds of Shikoku. Noriyori helped defeat the wayward Minamoto no Yoshinaka, his cousin, at the Second Battle of the Uji and the Battle of Awazu, before moving on to play a central role in the Battle of Ichi-no-Tani. The Taira were pushed back, and the war fell into a lull for about six months, during which Noriyori returned to Kyoto. Noriyori was sent out once more, in September 1184, to secure the provinces of the Ch≈´goku region, and then to move on into Ky≈´sh≈´. He played a major role in the Battle of Kojima. However, attempting to push further, he ran into difficulties of a lack of supplies, and the fact that the Inland Sea was controlled by his enemies. He wrote to his brother in Kamakura, and was told that supplies were on the way, but that the Taira were watching, so any shipments had to be done very carefully. Noriyori finally managed to get rice, other supplies, and a handful of war junks from a magnate in Suo Province. He moved on into Ky≈´sh≈´ as planned, and remained there, playing no role in the decisive Battle of Dan-no-ura. After the Genpei War was over, Noriyori returned to Kamakura, where he was rewarded by Yoritomo for his services. However, there was now a feud for dominance of the clan between Yoritomo and Yoshitsune. Yoritomo ordered Noriyori to arrest their brother; after unsuccessfully trying to convince Yoritomo to change his mind, Noriyori simply disobeyed outright. In May 1193, when Yoritomo held a grand hunt on Mount Fuji, an incident occurred in which two brothers of the Soga clan killed Kudo Suketsune, an enemy of their father. A rumor spread that Yoritomo had been killed. Yoritomo's wife, H≈çj≈ç Masako, was worried, but Noriyori comforted her, assuring her that even if Yoritomo were killed, he would be there for her and for the clan. These words caused Yoritomo to doubt his brother, who confined Noriyori to Izu Province. In 1193, Yoritomo had Noriyori killed on charges of conspiracy.

In other provinces, such as Alberta and Nova Scotia, the term refers to municipal districts that are not explicitly urban, rather than being a distinct type of municipality.  History  The Municipal Ordinance of 1883 was enacted by the then North-West Territories to provide services to a rural area and provide some means of municipal governing. Saskatchewan and Alberta became provinces in 1905. The Government of the North-West Territories issued Statute Labour Ordinance (1897) and sets of fire districts, statute labour and fire (SLF) districts or statute labour districts. Community residents could pay taxes or supply a couple days per quarter section labour constructing roads, bridges, fireguards instead of paying taxes. Prairie fires in the 19th century were devastating affairs. Fire districts were later called local improvement districts that were later reformed into rural municipalities. In Saskatchewan, local improvement districts (1898) were the precursors of rural municipalities. Discontinuance of local improvement districts in favour of smaller rural municipalities began on December 13, 1909. Typically, a rural municipality consists of about nine townships, each six miles by six miles in area. Settled areas of denser populations could form urban municipalities such as villages, towns and cities. In northern Saskatchewan, the large Northern Local Improvement District was replaced by the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District in 1972, and was not subdivided into smaller rural municipalities.

The population was 6,011 at the 2010 census. The town is home to Fox State Forest and part of Low State Forest. The main village of the town, where 1,976 people resided at the 2010 census, is defined as the Hillsborough census-designated place (CDP), and encompasses the main urban area of the town, located along the Contoocook River at the junction of New Hampshire Route 149 with Henniker Street and Main Street. The town also includes the villages of Hillsborough Center, Hillsborough Upper Village, Hillsborough Lower Village, and Emerald Lake Village. History School Street in 1907 The town was first granted in 1735 by colonial governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire Jonathan Belcher as \\"Number Seven\\", one in a line of nine Massachusetts towns set up as defense barriers against Indian attacks. The towns were renamed after the border between the two provinces was fixed in 1739, placing the towns in New Hampshire. Settled in 1741, the town was granted in 1748 by Governor Benning Wentworth as \\"Hillsborough\\", named for Sir Wills Hill, Earl of Hillsborough. It would be incorporated in 1772 by Governor John Wentworth. Hillsborough was the birthplace of Franklin Pierce, the 14th president of the United States and the only president from New Hampshire. The Pierce Homestead was built in 1804 (the year of his birth) by his father, Benjamin Pierce, a general in the Revolutionary War, and twice governor of New Hampshire. Restored in 1925, the home was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the house is today a museum owned by the state, and operated by the Hillsborough Historical Society. Pierce Homestead c. 1922 Five granite arch bridges built during the 19th century in Hillsborough are designated as National Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks. Railroad service was supplied to Hillsborough by the Boston and Maine Railroad from 1878 to 1972. Rail service north to Henniker had ceased in 1942, and Hillsborough became the end point on a line that once stretched in an arc from Nashua to Concord, New Hampshire. The rails in Hillsborough were torn up in 1979. Hillsborough was once home to an iconic railroad covered bridge and a curved wooden trestle. The bridge burned due to arson in 1985, and the trestle was dismantled shortly thereafter. The Hillsborough Branch now ends at Bennington; the line from Bennington to Hillsborough is a rail trail. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water, comprising 2.23% of the town. The town center, or census- designated place, has a total area of . The highest point in Hillsborough is Thompson Hill, at above sea level, in the northern part of town. Hillsborough is drained by the Contoocook River, in addition to Beard's and Sand brooks. Part of Franklin Pierce Lake is in the southwest. The town lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed. = Adjacent municipalities = * Bradford, New Hampshire (north) * Henniker, New Hampshire (east) * Deering, New Hampshire (southeast) * Antrim, New Hampshire (south) * Windsor, New Hampshire (west) * Washington, New Hampshire (northwest) Demographics Contoocook Mills in 1907 As of the census of 2010, there were 6,011 people, 2,392 households, and 1,614 families residing in the town.
