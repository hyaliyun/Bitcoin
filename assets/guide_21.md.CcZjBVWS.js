Its features include LED lighting, hidden cargo ramps, all-around cameras, and active aerodynamics meant to improve fuel efficiency at high speeds. The active aerodynamics should improve the Atlas's fuel economy by two mpg.  Features  A 360 degree camera provides a birds eye view during low speed driving and helps the truck get into small spaces. The new tailgate step was designed for easy entrance into the truck bed. Another feature is cargo ramps which were designed to make it easier to load wheeled items. The Trailer Backup assist automatically lines up the truck with the trailer. The last feature is automatic start/stop button. This feature was meant to improve fuel economy. Mileage is improved due to start/stop button and active grille shutters. The weight is unknown, however the next generation F150 based on the Atlas concept may be 700 pounds lighter than the current F-150 due extensive use of aluminum.  Interior  The interior has blue LED lighting, four air conditioners, a screen with GPS and two cup holders. The Atlas also features leather seats. There is also a backseat with a tiny screen and two air conditioners.  Exterior  The Atlas has 110 volt outlets in the bed. It will also have tailgate steps. The front has adjustable air dams. This feature was added to improve fuel efficiency and improves ground clearance when off-road. Active Grille Shutters will also improve fuel efficiency.

He ruled from 1649 to 1679. He completed the work of his predecessor, Nasir bin Murshid, in driving the Portuguese out of Oman. Their last base in Muscat fell to his forces in January 1650. He built up Omani sea power, taking the fight against the Portuguese to their bases in India and East Africa. During his reign the country was peaceful and increasingly prosperous. Accession Rustaq fort Sultan bin Saif was the cousin of the Imam Nasir bin Murshid bin Sultan al Ya'Aruba, who had founded the Yaruba dynasty in 1624. The Imam Nasir died on 14 April 1649 and was buried at Nizwa. He left no sons. The notables who gathered at Rustaq on the day he died selected Sultan bin Saif and proclaimed him Imam. The succession appears to have been undisputed. War with the Portuguese Fort Al Jalali, built by the Portuguese in Muscat harbor When Nasir died, the Portuguese, who had once occupied several ports along the coast, now only had a tenuous hold on Muscat. Sultan bin Saif was resolved to finish the task of expelling them from Oman, but first built up his own fleet. He started his campaign against Muscat towards the end of 1649. Although Sultan gathered a large force outside the port of Muttrah, next to Muscat, the town was captured by a small group that made a surprise attack at night. The Portuguese commander took refuge in Fort Capitan. On 28 January 1650 it surrendered. The Omanis also captured two Portuguese naval vessels that were anchored in the port of Muttrah. Following this the Portuguese continued sporadic war at sea, but made no serious effort to recapture Muscat. Sultan bin Saif initiated a naval offensive against the Portuguese bases in India and on the east coast of Africa. He added captured ships to his navy, which became increasingly powerful. Sultan launched a raid on the Portuguese at Mumbai in India in 1655. The Omani fleet attacked the Portuguese in Mumbai in 1661 and Diu in 1668, 1670 and 1676. Sultan received a petition from the people of Mombasa on the East African coast asking for help in removing the Portuguese and offering to accept Omani sovereignty in return. A force was dispatched and blockaded the fort of Mombasa for five years before it surrendered. An Arab governor was installed. However, the Portuguese returned soon after and recaptured the town. Trade and construction The Dutch had a factory at Gombroon, now Bandar Abbas, on the Persian side of the Strait of Hormuz. After the fall of Muscat in 1650 they received large shipments of goods from the Netherlands and greatly expanded their trade in the Persian Gulf region. In 1651 Sultan bin Saif visited Gombroon in person, and offered to open a land route for the Dutch traders via Abu Dhabi and Qatif to Basra by which the Dutch could avoid paying Persian customs duties. The Dutch politely declined. In 1659 Sultan bin Saif was visited by Colonel Rainsford of the English East India Company, seeking to negotiate a lease on the port of Muscat. Sultan refused this request. Oman became the strongest sea power in the western Indian Ocean. Trade mounted from Omanis based in Africa, bringing wealth into the country. Sultan bin Saif's trading activity drew criticism from the religious leaders, who felt that this was inappropriate for an Imam. The round tower of the Nizwa Fort, built by Sultan bin Saif Some of the new wealth was used to fund construction of the aflaj underground water system. Sultan bin Saif built the falaj daris from Izki to Nizwa, the largest falaj in the country. He erected the huge round tower of the Nizwa Fort. The structure, high, was built on an earlier fort that had itself been assembled from several smaller forts. This was where he located his capital. Sultan bin Saif set up a strong and stable administration, with governors and judges who applied the laws justly. According to George Percy Badger, in his 1871 A History of the Imaums and Sayyids of Oman, Sultan bin Saif died in 1679 and was succeeded by his son, Bil'arab bin Sultan.

He was a torpedo expert and his extensive experience as a commander of destroyers and destroyer formations made him more knowledgeable about the escort of convoys than most Japanese commanders of his time. He is best known for his command of the 5th Fleet during the latter stages of the Aleutians campaign in the spring and summer of 1943.The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia: Kawase Shiro (1889-1946) Biography Kawase was born on 7 July 1889. He graduated from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy on 18 July 1910, ranked 22nd in a class of 149 cadets. Early career As a midshipman, Kawase was assigned after graduation to the protected cruiser , then transferred briefly to the armored cruiser on 23 March 1911 and then to the armored cruiser on 1 April 1911. Receiving his commission as an ensign on 1 December 1911, he attended the basic classes at the Gunnery School and Torpedo School in 1912 and 1913. Promoted to lieutenant, junior grade, on 1 December 1913, he served aboard the destroyer before transferring to the protected cruiser on 27 May 1914. World War I Kawase was aboard Chikuma when Japan entered World War I on the side of the Allies on 23 August 1914. Chikuma was part of the Imperial Japanese Navy squadron which gave chase to the German East Asia Squadron in 1914, then joined the armored cruisers and in hunting for the Imperial German Navy light cruiser SMS Emden, which was raiding Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean. From December 1914 to February 1915, Chikuma and the protected cruiser patrolled off the northern coast of Queensland, Australia. Kawase transferred to the new battleship , still fitting out, on 30 June 1915, and was aboard her for her commissioning on 8 November 1915. She entered service with the 1st Fleet in December 1915 and patrolled off the coast of China without seeing combat. On 1 December 1916, Kawase was promoted to lieutenant and reported aboard the destroyer . On 2 July 1917, Kawase reported ashore for duty with the 2nd Naval District. Later in the year, he took the B Class at the Naval War College, then located in Tokyos Tsukiji district, and in 1918 he took the Advanced Class at the Torpedo School. World War I ended on 11 November 1918 before his next sea tour began. Interwar, 1918‚Äì1941 Kawase returned to sea duty on 1 December 1918, when he began an assignment aboard the destroyer . He joined the staff of the 3rd Fleet on 26 June 1920, then returned for more duty aboard Amatsukaze on 1 October 1920. On 1 December 1920 he began the A Course at the Naval War College in Tokyo. After completing the class, he was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 December 1922 and was assigned to the Yokosuka Guard Force. Kawases next tour was his first as a commanding officer, when he took command of the destroyer on 1 December 1924. He began duty with the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff in Tokyo on 20 May 1925 before taking command of the destroyer . On 1 December 1925 he joined the staff of the Combined Fleet, and on 1 December 1926 he became an instructor at the Torpedo School. He became a member of the staff of the Naval Shipbuilding Command on 20 August 1927, and on 1 December 1927 received a promotion to commander. On 10 March 1929, Kawase began duty in the United Kingdom. Returning to Japan, he became executive officer of the battleship on 15 January 1931. On 2 November 1931 he returned to destroyer duty as commanding officer of Destroyer Division 3, and he received a promotion to captain on 1 December 1931. He took command of Destroyer Division 6 on 15 November 1932. On 1 November 1934, Kawase returned to the Naval Shipbuilding Command for another tour of duty. While there, he was promoted to rear admiral on 1 December 1937, with his first assignment as a flag officer being service as Chief, B2, Naval Shipbuilding Command. He returned to sea duty on 15 November 1938 as commanding officer of Destroyer Squadron 5, and he took command of Destroyer Squadron 1 on 25 November 1939. He joined the staff of the 1st Fleet on 15 October 1940, and then took command of aircraft carriers, first as commander of Carrier Division 7 on 15 November 1940 and then as commander of Carrier Division 11 on 10 April 1941. He became schoolmaster at the Torpedo School on 1 September 1941 and received a promotion to vice admiral on 15 October 1941. World War II, 1941‚Äì19451941‚Äì1943= Japan entered World War II on 7 December 1941 - 8 December 1941 across the International Date Line in Japan - with its attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Soon thereafter, Kawase took command of the 3rd China Expeditionary Fleet - responsible for operations off northern China, in the Bohai Gulf and off Tsingtao - on 26 December 1941. He transferred to the Navy General Staff in Tokyo on 10 April 1942, then on 15 September 1942 became commander of the ≈åminato Guard District, the major Imperial Japanese Navy base in northern Honshu, responsible for control of Tsugaru Strait and patrols along the coasts of Hokkaid≈ç and Karafuto and in the Kurile Islands. =Aleutians campaign= Vice Admiral Boshir≈ç Hosogaya, commander of the 5th Fleet and the Northern Area Force, put in an embarrassing performance in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands on 26 March 1943 while in command of a task force escorting a convoy bringing reinforcements to the Japanese garrison on Kiska in the Aleutian Islands, sending the convoy back to port and withdrawing in the face of a smaller United States Navy force. As a result, Hosogaya was relieved of command on 31 March 1943, and Kawase was placed in charge of the 5th Fleet and the Northern Area Force the following day with his headquarters at Paramushiro in the Kurile Islands. Attu, May 1943 In addition to the troops on Kiska, Japan had an Aleutian garrison on Attu; a U.S. Navy force of cruisers and destroyers bombarded Attu in late April 1943, but Kawase missed a chance to attack that force when a false report of an enemy ship off Shumushu in the Kurile Islands caused him instead to divert forces to deal with it, only to find that it was a neutral Soviet ship laying mines in Soviet waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, pp. 39-40. By early May 1943, Japan had alerted the troops on Attu that an American invasion of the island was imminent. One of Kawases first priorities as the new fleet commander was to send reinforcements to Attu to aid in defense of the island. However, heavy losses in the Guadalcanal campaign and the ongoing Solomon Islands campaign had forced Japan to divert forces to the defense of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and Kawase was forced to inform the island commander, Imperial Japanese Army Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki, that no reinforcements could arrive until late May, when increased fog in the Aleutians would help a reinforcement convoy avoid detection by American forces and by which time Japanese merchant ships earmarked for the reinforcement operation would have radar installed. Meanwhile, Kawase ordered Yamasaki to hold Attu with the forces he already had.Garfield, Brian, The Thousand-Mile War: World War II in Alaska and the Aleutians, Fairbanks, Alaska: University of Alaska Press, 1995, , pp. 269, 271. The Battle of Attu began on 11 May 1943, when United States Army troops landed on the island. Kawase put to sea from Paramushiro in his flagship, the heavy cruiser , accompanied by a destroyer to rendezvous with the seaplane tender , which was part of a small convoy carrying floatplanes to Attu. In response to Kawases urgent request for more warships with which to oppose the American landings, Combined Fleet commander-in-chief Admiral Mineichi Koga assigned a task force centered around a heavy cruiser and two light cruisers to the 5th Fleet, and it departed Paramushiro on 17 May to rendezvous with Kawase south of the Komandorski Islands. However, Kawase had received reports that the U.S. Navy task force of 40 ships included three battleships and an aircraft carrier, and - not knowing that the American ships were temporarily out of ammunition after providing gunfire support to American troops ashore - he ordered his outnumbered and outgunned task force to loiter 300 nautical miles (556 km) west of Attu, hoping for a break that would allow him to get the reinforcements through.Garfield, p. 309. He was still circling there on 20 May when Imperial General Headquarters ordered him to attack U.S. Navy forces off Attu; when he responded that his force did not stand a chance against the superior U.S. Navy force around the island, Imperial General Headquarters changed its orders the same day, directing him instead to use submarines to evacuate the Attu garrison. Accordingly, Kawase ordered his submarine force to move toward the island, and on 23 May informed Yamasaki that no reinforcement convoy would arrive and that his troops should prepare to evacuate by submarine.Garfield, p. 314.Morison, p. 43 Plagued by bad weather, Japanese aircraft made their only appearance at Attu on 23 May 1943 when 16 naval Mitsubishi G4M (Allied reporting name \\"Betty\\") bombers made an unsuccessful torpedo attack against American ships offshore, losing nine of their number. On 28 May, Kawase informed Yamasaki that the 5th Fleets submarine force had been recalled because of losses it had suffered to U.S. Navy destroyers, and Attu fell to the Americans on 30 May after the almost complete annihilation of the isolated Japanese garrison.Garfield, pp. 321, 327, 332-333. Kiska, July 1943 The loss of Attu placed American forces in between Paramushiro and Kiska, allowing them to blockade Kiska. United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft soon began to operate from Attu; USAAF aircraft staging through Attu even made the first airstrike against Paramushiro on 18 July 1943, causing a startled Kawase to wheel his office chair to a window to see what was happening after a string of bombs detonated on a taxiway. The USAAF aircraft on Attu strengthened the blockade of Kiska and made it impossible for Kawase to send supplies or reinforcements to Kiska in surface ships; only his submarine force made resupply runs there, completing 20 such trips by 9 June 1943. Imperial General Headquarters wanted the Kiska garrison withdrawn so that its troops could be employed in the defense of the Kurile Islands, and ordered Kawase to use his submarines to evacuate them. The pace of American operations in the Aleutians suggested that the Allies would invade Kiska by late July 1943, and Kawase doubted that his submarine force - originally 13 submarines, but reduced to eight thanks to combat losses since the Battle of Attu began - could complete the 40 to 50 trips necessary to complete an evacuation by then. By 21 June, when Kawase ordered an end to the submarine evacuation operations, the 5th Fleet had lost three more submarines, and Japanese submarines had managed to evacuate only 820 troops, of whom 300 had died in the sinking of the submarines carrying them.Garfield, pp. 357-358Morison, p. 57. An American naval bombardment of Kiska on 6 July 1943, the first in nearly a year, convinced Kawase that an American invasion was imminent, and that his submarines could never get the garrison off the island in time; he wrote, \\"We cannot be...dependent on the submarines any longer...the evacuation has to be completed as soon as possible before mid- July.\\"Garfield, pp. 358-359 He decided to gamble on a bold move: Running the American blockade by steaming a surface force to Kiska in what the Japanese designated as Operation Ke-Go. Ordering a screen of submarines to deploy south of Amchitka to cover the surface ships, he placed the commander of Destroyer Squadron 1, Rear Admiral Masatomi Kimura, in command of an evacuation force made up of the light cruisers , , and , ten destroyers, an escort vessel, and an oiler. With Kawase aboard Tama as an observer, the force departed Paramushiro on 21 July 1943 bound for a point 500 nautical miles (926 km) south of Kiska, where it would refuel and await fog cover for its run to the island.Garfield, pp. 358-361, 368. Receiving reports on 25 July that a U.S. Navy PBY Catalina flying boat had made radar contact on Japanese ships operating southwest of Attu, a force of U.S. Navy battleships, cruisers, and destroyers set off in search of it and, on 26 July opened fire on phantom radar contacts (\\"pips\\") south of Amchitka in what became known as the \\"Battle of the Pips.\\" The American ships then withdrew to refuel and replenish their ammunition. Kawases and Kimuras force was 400 nautical miles (741 km) to the south at the time.Garfield, pp. 364-368.Morison, pp. 59-61 Five of the Japanese ships collided with one another on 26 July, and the escort vessel and a destroyer were so badly damaged that they could not make the final run in to Kiska Harbor, but Kawase and Kimura began a high-speed dash to Kiska that day with the remaining ships under cover of an advancing fog front. On 27 July, the Japanese ships steamed right through the area where the American force had \\"fought\\" the Battle of the Pips the day before; had the Americans preserved their ammunition supply and remained on station, they would have intercepted Kawases and Kimuras ships. Giving up on awaiting the arrival of a storm before entering port, Kawase ordered the ships forward on 28 July to make the final run in to Kiska. While Tama with Kawase on board waited 20 nautical miles (37 km) offshore to cover the operation, Kimura and the remaining ships entered Kiska Harbor, took aboard all 5,183 Japanese troops in an hour, rendezvoused with Tama and Kawase, and made a high-speed dash back out of the area, arriving at Paramushiro on 31 July-1 August 1943.Garfield, pp. 370-372.Morison, pp. 58-59. Assisted by the weather and the American confusion that resulted in the Battle of the Pips, Kawase and Kimura completed Operation KE-GO without firing a shot - except when Abukuma fired a spread of four torpedoes at Little Kiska Island on 26 July in the mistaken belief that it was an enemy ship - or suffering any casualties and without being detected by Allied forces. In fact, American and Canadian forces earmarked for the invasion of Kiska were so unaware of the Japanese evacuation that they continued a heavy air and naval bombardment of the island and dropped propaganda leaflets there until their troops stormed ashore in Operation Cottage on 15 August 1943 expecting heavy combat with the Japanese - only to find the island uninhabited.Garfield, pp. 357-372, 373-396.Morison, pp. 61-65. =1943‚Äì1945= With the Aleutians campaign over, the Imperial Japanese Navy abolished the Northern Area Force on 4 August 1943, and replaced it the following day with a new Northeast Area Fleet combining the assets of the 5th Fleet and the 12th Air Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Michitaro Tozuka. Kawase retained command of the naval surface component of Tozukas fleet, reduced to one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, two destroyer divisions, seven troopships, and a number of patrol vessels and other small craft.Morison, Samuel Eliot, History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Volume VII: Aleutians, Gilberts, and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1984, p. 65n. Kawase began another tour of duty with the Navy General Staff in Tokyo on 15 February 1944, then moved briefly to the position of assistant chief of staff of the Southwest Area Fleet - which coordinated naval, air, and ground forces for the occupation and defense of the Philippine Islands, French Indochina, the Malay Peninsula, and the Netherlands East Indies - on 5 June 1944. He became the commander of the 2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet, responsible for operations in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies, on 18 June 1944; during his time in command, U.S. Navy submarines attacked Japanese shipping in the area, and aircraft from British aircraft carriers struck targets on Sumatra in July, August, and September 1944Sturtivant, Ray, British Naval Aviation: The Fleet Air Arm, 1917‚Äì1990, Annapolis, Maryland: Naval Institute Press, 1990, , pp. 124-125. and January 1945.Hobbs, David, \\"The Royal Navy's Pacific Strike Force,\\" Naval History, February 2013, p. 27. Kawase returned to the Navy General Staff on 29 January 1945. Retirement Kawase retired from the Navy on 20 March 1945, five months before World War II ended on 15 August 1945. Death Kawase died in Japan on 20 July 1946 at the age of 57.

Hensel attended Franklin and Marshall College and graduated in 1870. Hensel had an early interest in politics, and in 1872 he canvassed for Charles R. Buckalew in his unsuccessful run for governorship. Hensel was admitted to the bar in 1873. In 1874, Hensel bought a half-interest in the Lancaster Intelligencer and became its editor. Under his direction, the paper went from the typical small-town litany of local trivia to the more big-town news-as-drama and political advocacy. In 1875, Hensel became even more involved in local Democratic politics, being elected Chairman of the Democratic Committee of Lancaster County. Hensel kept up his law practice, and when in 1880 the paper ran an editorial criticizing a judge, he and his co-owner were disbarred. On appeal to the state Supreme Court, with several prominent state lawyers, and fellow newspaperman and politician Alexander McClure defending him, they were unanimously readmitted. In 1882 Hensel was elected President of the Pennsylvania State Editorial Association. In 1886 Hensel sold his interest in the Intelligencer, and in 1887 opened a law office with J. Hay Brown that proved very successful. In 1891, Governor Pattison appointed Hensel to Attorney General. Among other things, he tried to root out corruption within Pattison's cabinet, and prosecuted the state Attorney Auditor and state Secretary of the Treasurer. In his later years he devoted himself strongly to local history and affairs. Hensel helped found the Lancaster County Historical Society. In 1914, Hensel's health declined sharply and he retired from practice, and moved south for his health, finally dying in Savannah, Georgia.

He ruled from 1624 to 1649. He took power during a chaotic period when the former dynasty had collapsed and the interior of the country was lawless, while the Portuguese held the main coastal ports. In a series of campaigns he established his authority over the Omani tribes and expelled the Portuguese from most of their bases. Background By the early 17th century the ruling Nabhani dynasty of Oman had become weakened, exerting control over only half of the kingdom. The interior of Oman was divided into a number of small states and tribal regions. Ibadi tribes originating from Yemen had once formed the large majority, but over time Sunni Nizar tribes had become equal in strength, in part due to immigration. Two Nabhani brothers were competing for power, Makhzoom bin Fellah bin Mohsin at Yanqul and Nebhan bin Fellah. Around 1615 Makhzoom died and his cousin Omair bin Himyar entered the fray, defeating Nebhan bin Fellah at Yanqul in 1617. Omair bin Himyar died around 1624, the last of his dynasty, and a succession struggle erupted. The leading candidates were from the Yaareba, one of the best established and most powerful of the tribes. Malik bin Abul Arar al-Yaarebi controlled Rustaq and tried to seize power. An assembly of notables was convened at Rustaq to settle the matter, and Sheikh Nasir bin Murshid al-Yaarebi was unanimously elected Imam. Internal struggles Rustaq fort Nakhal fort The new Imam was not universally accepted, and faced a potential threat from the Nizar tribes. Nasir bin Murshid immediately began to assert control over the interior. Nasir bin Murshid built up his army and took the main towns as well as the forts of Rustaq and Nakhal. He quickly took the Rustaq fort, which had been held by his cousins since his grandfather Malik bin Abul Arar had died in 1620. In 1625 Nasir gathered a force that he led to Nakhal, which he captured from his great uncle Sultan bin Abul Arar. He was attacked in this position, but broke out and returned to Rustaq, then took Izki and Nizwa. Nasir moved the capital to Nizwa, the former capital of the Ibadi Imamate. Nasir continued his successful campaign, eventually feeling strong enough to attack the Nizar tribes, who controlled the Al Dhahireh region. The campaign was protracted, lasting several years, but was militarily successful although the Nizar tribes remained hostile. In the 1630s Nasir faced a challenge from a group of Nizar tribes led by the Beni Hilal under Sheikh Nasir bin Katan al-Helali. The Beni Hilal raids, for the purpose of taking slaves and booty, became a menace that the Imam was unable to suppress. Eventually he had to resort to paying a large ransom to Sheikh Nasir, which resolved the problem. Campaigns against the Portuguese Nasir was able to unify the tribes with a common goal of expelling the Portuguese, who had taken control of the coastal cities of Sur, Qurayyat, Muscat and Sohar. Around 1633 Nasir raised a large army that he dispatched in an unsuccessful attempt to take Muscat. Nasir next dispatched an army against Julfar (now Ras al-Khaimah). This port was defended by two forts, one manned by the Persians and the other by the Portuguese. Both forts were captured and the Persians were ejected. The Portuguese were also forced to leave Julfar. In 1633 Nasir sent an army against Sohar, also held by the Portuguese, but it was defeated. A temporary truce was arranged with the Portuguese, but Nasir then took Sur and Qurayyat from the Portuguese, who were now seriously weakened and demoralized. In 1643 he took the fort at Sohar. In 1646 he signed a trade agreement with Britain. In 1648 fighting resumed against the Portuguese, who now held only Muscat. A treaty was agreed in October 1648 very much to the Omani advantage. Nasir bin Murshid died on 14 April 1649 and was buried at Nizwa. He was succeeded by his cousin, Sultan bin Saif, who was to soon drive the Portuguese entirely out of the country.

The team was led by Charles Fickert, the first former Stanford player to serve as head football coach at his alma mater. The team played its home games at Stanford, California. Stanford compiled a 3‚Äì1‚Äì2 record in the regular season and was invited to represent the West in the Tournament East-West football game to be held in Tournament Park in Pasadena, California on New Year's Day, 1902, facing East representative Michigan, a team which had yet to yield a point all season. Stanford had no better luck, losing 49‚Äì0 in what would eventually be known as the Rose Bowl. ScheduleGame summaries=Michigan (Tournament East‚ÄìWest Football Game) After the conclusion of the 1901 football season, Stanford was invited to play against Michigan in a game to be held on New Year's Day, 1902 in Tournament Park in Pasadena, California. The game was dubbed the Tournament East‚ÄìWest Football Game and was held as part of the Tournament of Roses event to encourage tourism to the mild climate of Southern California at a time of year when most of the nation was experiencing cold winter weather. In the game, Stanford was no match for Michigan, which had outscored its opponents 501‚Äì0 during the regular season. Led by fullback Neil Snow, who ran for five touchdowns, the Wolverines led 49‚Äì0 with eight minutes remaining before the teams agreed to end the game early. The outcome of the game soured the Tournament of Roses committee on football, and it was not until 1916 that football was again included as part of the festivities. The game is considered the first-ever postseason bowl game in college football.

Her courses involved the sensitisation of all the sensory organs, mental training and individual psychological sessions. One student observed that \\"She was convinced that she could place us, the students, by means of music and a self-induced trance state, into an inner equilibrium that would strengthen and harmonize our creative powers\\". Grunow claimed that her work could help develop any human ability, even boxing. She developed a 'twelve-tone circle of colour' which was analogous with the twelve-tone music of the Austrian composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951). She also explored the correlation between form and colour, as did her Bauhaus colleagues Itten, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee.

Etymology of the name Wilyakali Etymologically the word kali appears to be an archaic term meaning 'people' and is incorporated in numerous tribal names of the Darling River valley, including Paakantyi (Creek People),Bula-ali (Hill people) and Thangkakali. In this construction the name would mean the Wilya people. Wilyakali language The Wilyakali language is part of the Paakantyi subgroup family. The language is considered to be largely extinct from the 1930s with only 23 speakers. Country Traditional lands of the Wilyakali, shown as \\"Wiljali\\". Wilyakali traditional lands covered an estimated from the Barrier Ranges westwards to Olary in South Australia. They encompassed Silverton, Mutooroo and Boolcoomata. To the northwest they reached Mootwingee, and northeast to just south of Sturt Meadows. The tribe apparently moved south in the first half of the 19th century from its earlier domain to resist strong-arm cultural pressures from the Ngadjuri to adopt circumcision. The Malyangapa lived on their northern tribal borders, while the Yadliyawara were to their west. Traditional culture Traditional Wilyakali adopted many cultural influences from people to their north and west, such as mura stories. According to A. P. Elkin, its kinship system terms bore some overlap with those of the Wadikali. History=Arrival of Europeans The ethnographer A. W.

Ruiz had become the WBA heavyweight champion in 2001 after defeating ageing four-time champion Evander Holyfield. Ruiz would successfully defend his title twice, first fighting to a draw in a third match with Holyfield later in 2001 and then defeating Kirk Johnson by disqualification in his only fight in 2002. Ruiz's promoter Don King spent much of 2002 negotiating with Jones in an effort to get him to agree to move up to heavyweight and challenge Ruiz. Eventually Jones accepted an offer that guaranteed him $10 million. Ruiz, however, received no guaranteed money and instead agreed to take a share of the pay-per-view profits.

By round four Jones' punches caused Ruiz's nose to bleed, which hindered Ruiz for the remainder of the fight. The fight went the full 12 rounds with neither man being able to score a knockdown.

Jones' victory made him the first former world middleweight champion to become a world heavyweight champion in 106 years, since Bob Fitzsimmons from Great Britain did so in 1897. Jones' victory over Ruiz also made Jones only the second light-heavyweight boxer in history to move up and win a major heavyweight title in his first fight in the heavyweight division (Michael Spinks being the first to do so in 1985, when defeating Larry Holmes).Jones Makes History With Decision Over Ruiz, N.Y.

The first phase was approved for development in October 2013. Physical work on the project is to begin on 3 August 2020. Background The existing rail-based transport systems in South Wales were severely degraded following the 1960s Beeching cuts, with the closure of many lines serving the former mining communities and their links to ports on the South Wales coast. These left many smaller former mining communities isolated and without rail services. From the 1980s, some of the closures have been reversed: services reinstated on Cardiff's City Line in 1987, the Aberdare Line in 1988, the Maesteg Line in 1992, the Vale of Glamorgan Line between Barry and Bridgend in 2005, and the Ebbw Vale Line in 2008. Development In February 2011, Cardiff Business Partnership (CBP) and the Institute of Welsh Affairs published a report by Professor Mark Barry of Cardiff University, calling for an investment of ¬£2.5bn over 10 years to connect Cardiff, Newport and the South Wales Valleys. The report concluded that with the stated investment in a regional metro system, by 2025 it would be possible to travel from the Heads of the Valleys to Cardiff or Newport in 40 minutes, by combining electrified heavy rail and light rail systems and boosted by faster rail links to London and Heathrow Airport. After the Welsh Government, supported by parties including a CBP team led by Mark Barry, lobbied at Westminster for the extension of the Great Western Main Line electrification programme west to , and north into the South Wales Valleys, Barry developed a more detailed blueprint plan for Cardiff. After internal consultation, this was submitted by CBP to the Welsh Government's Business Minister Edwina Hart in December 2012. The scheme proposed a ¬£200m investment in a Cardiff cross-rail scheme based on trams, between St Mellons in the east via Cardiff Central, south into Cardiff Bay, north to , converting a number of Valley Lines heavy rail routes to light rail, and a new route north-west via Ely and Radyr Court to the M4 motorway near Creigiau. From Autumn 2012, Barry led the private sector Metro Consortium, with the common aim of promoting the South Wales Metro project, which included representatives from Capita, Jones Lang LaSalle, The Urbanists and Steer Davies Gleave. They produced a further interim report, \\"A Cardiff City Region Metro: transform  regenerate  connect\\" published in February 2013. Hart then commissioned Barry to lead a more detailed analysis of the potential benefits, leading to the publication of The Metro Impact Study in October 2013. This more substantive report concluded that an initial ¬£1bn investment in an integrated metro transport network for South East Wales could, over a 30-year period, add 420,000 people to the regional transport network, create 7,000 new jobs and plough an additional ¬£4bn into the regional economy. In October 2013, after Barry had submitted his report to Hart at the end of summer 2013, the Business Minister endorsed the report. She allocated ¬£62m for phase one of the scheme to improve bus and rail links, including rail infrastructure improvements, station upgrades, park and ride schemes, bus corridors, and walking and cycling schemes. She also set up a working group to examine detailed proposals for the potential subsequent stages of the Cardiff Capital Region Metro system. Implementation Llandaf station sign with interim Metro branding, July 2017 First Minister Carwyn Jones formally launched the South Wales Metro in November 2015, with the Welsh Government setting out its aspirations for the Metro in its November 2015 publication, \\"Rolling Out Our Metro\\".http://gov.wales/docs/det/publications/160224-metro-information- brochure-en.pdf Procurement for the Metro began in July 2016, as part of the procurement process for the next Wales & Borders franchise.

In August 2019 it was announced that work on the project would be delayed, due to \\"unresolved issues\\" particularly around maintenance cost estimates, which are preventing sale of the freehold land, buildings, and operational assets, by current owner Network Rail to the Welsh Ministers. The deal will require approval from the Office of Rail and Road before contractor Amey Keolis Infrastructure can undertake work including electrification and other improvements. The project faces a deadline of 2022 for some work, as the work will need to meet the deadline for the ¬£159m in awarded European Regional Development funding, which will not be available after that date due to Brexit. It has been announced that the first work on the project will start on 3 August, beginning with track improvements on lines to Merthyr Tydfil, Aberdare and Treherbert. These lines will operate as a rail replacement service between 8pm and 5am until December 2020, except on Fridays and Saturdays. The phase two works are scheduled to be completed by 2023.

Ami, 1 September 2013, pp. 128-132. was a Hasidic composer of Jewish liturgical music and choirmaster in the main synagogue of the Gerrer Rebbes both in Ger, Poland, and in Jerusalem, Israel. Known as \\"the Beethoven of the Gerrer Rebbes\\", he composed dozens of new melodies every year for the prayer services, including marches, waltzes, and dance tunes. Though he had no musical training and could not read music, Talmud composed over 1,500 melodies. Early life Yaakov Dov (Yankel) Talmud was born on 18 December 1885 (10 Tevet 5646) in Warsaw, Poland, to a family of Gerrer Hasidim. His father, an accomplished Talmid Chacham, worked in the lumber trade. Yankel was orphaned at a young age and was raised by Kotzk Hasidim in that city. As a young child, Yankel often sneaked into the main Ger synagogue to listen to the choir rehearse for the High Holy Days. When he was 12, choirmaster Yisrael Eckstein spotted him and demanded to know why he was there. Yankel begged Eckstein to test his voice. He became a member of the choir the very next Shabbat. Talmud broadened his understanding of music and prayer by visiting well-known baalei tefillah (prayer leaders) such as Reb Zeidel Rovner and Reb Nissan Belzer. As a young man, he was given the responsibility of importing the niggunim of Reb Yonah Erlich, Reb Nissan Koshinover, and others to Ger. Often he altered the tunes with his own additions and revisions. Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, third Gerrer Rebbe (center), walking with his Hasidim in Europe, circa 1920s/1930s. He became the choirmaster in the main Ger synagogue during the leadership of the third Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, the Imrei Emes. Singing and leading his choir of 20 boys under the age of bar mitzvah, he also began composing his own melodies. In the Ger tradition, the prayer leader is the only one who sings the words of the prayers with their melody; the choir and congregants sing only the melody. Talmud wrote hundreds of melodies for every part of the prayer service, investing each tune with rich emotional expression. The Gerrer Hasidim would return home after a visit to their Rebbe humming Talmud's new melodies, popularizing them in their hometowns. Talmud received many requests from other choirs and musicians to compose music for them, but he demurred, reserving his talent solely for the Gerrer Rebbes and their Hasidim. His inspiring melodies became so popular and widely known that it is said that thousands of Gerrer Hasidim sang them in the Nazi death camps. Yehuda Meir Abramowicz, a Gerrer Hasid who later served in the Israeli Knesset, wrote in an article after Talmud's death: > Countless people were slaughtered during the Holocaust years. Among them > were many thousands of Gerrer Hasidim who went to their deaths with the > tunes of Reb Yaakov Talmud on their lips. When I told this to Reb Yaakov > when he was in chutz la'aretz (outside the Land of Israel), he became very > emotional. \\"This is my portion from all my toil\\", he said. \\"This is my > comfort in my sorrow\\". Move to Mandatory Palestine Talmud married, went into business, and served as a community activist in Poland. He was a representative to the first Knessiah Gedolah of the World Agudath Israel in Frankfurt in 1923. In 1933 he and his family immigrated to Mandatory Palestine. He found work as a kashrut supervisor at Assaf Harofeh Hospital. In 1940, when the Imrei Emes arrived in Mandatory Palestine after his escape from war-torn Europe, he encouraged Talmud to continue to compose new melodies. Talmud proceeded to compose 20 new pieces for Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Purim, and Shavuot every year, up to and including the year of his death. Additionally, he often composed new melodies for Shabbat prayers such as \\"Lekhah Dodi\\" and \\"Keil Adon\\" in honor of Special Shabbats, such as Shabbat Shekalim and Shabbat Hanukkah.Marks, Yehudah. \\"Sing Only for Hashem's Honor\\". Hamodia Israel News, 12 September 2013, pp. A24-A25. He traveled to Jerusalem for every Shabbat Mevorchim (the Shabbat preceding a new month) to lead the prayers in the synagogue of the fourth Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Yisrael Alter (the Beis Yisrael, who succeeded his father as Rebbe in 1948), and to eat a meal by the Rebbe.Mandelbaum (2005), p. 214. Talmud suffered a heart attack in his later years and underwent surgery in 1963. Shortly after conducting the Ger choir in Jerusalem for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur 1965, he fell ill. He died a few days later during the Sukkot holiday. The Beis Yisrael led his funeral. Musical style Talmud never studied music. He did not know the rules of musical composition or how to read music.Mandelbaum (2005), p. 213. As soon as he composed a new tune, he would ask a professional musician to write down the score. His son, Chaim, often assisted him in this task. Despite his lack of training, Talmud had a natural ear for music. He composed hundreds of pieces in all music types, including marches, waltzes, and dance tunes. His emotional melodies brought his listeners to tears and stirred their religious fervor.Mandelbaum (2005), pp. 213-214. His total output is estimated at over 1,500 melodies, most of them sung by him and his choir in the main Ger synagogue in Poland and in Israel. In 1955 the Israeli government accorded Talmud special recognition for his 1,000th composition. Several of Talmud's compositions are still widely sung today. These include his rousing \\"Shir Hamaalos\\" march tune, performed at many weddings, and \\"Lo Sevoshi\\", sung in Hasidic shtiebels. Recordings Cantor David Werdyger, who performed as a soloist in Talmud's choir in Ger at age 12,Werdyger and Frankel, Songs of Hope (1993), pp. 36-37. later arranged and produced hundreds of Talmud's compositions through his recording company, Aderet Records. Talmud collaborated with Werdyger to prepare the first three collections of Songs of the Gerer Chassidim, with Werdyger singing to the accompaniment of a choir and orchestra.Werdyger and Frankel, Songs of Hope (1993), p. 283. Werdyger's recordings include: *Songs of the Gerer Chassidim Loi Sevoishi (1962) *A Gerer Melava Malka (1963) *Songs of the Gerer Chassidim Vehoer Eineinu (1966) *Ger Holiday Songs (1973) *Ger Favorite Nigunim (1974) The contents of these albums were re-mastered and re-released in 2008 in a three-CD set as 1100 Gerrer Niggunim by Aderet Records.

Crc Handbook of Coastal Processes and Erosion. Crc Series in Marine Science. Boca Raton, Fla.: CRC Press, 1983. Print.Bird, E. C. F. Coasts. An Introduction to Systematic Geomorphology,. Cambridge, Mass.,: M.I.T. Press, 1969. Print. The primary agent in coastal sediment transport is wave activity (see Wind wave), followed by tides and storm surge (see Tide and Storm surge), and near shore currents (see Sea#Currents) . Wind-generated waves play a key role in the transfer of energy from the open ocean to the coastlines. In addition to the physical processes acting upon the shore, the size distribution of the sediment is a critical determination for how the beach will change (see Grain size determination). These various interactions generate a wide variety of beaches. (see Beach). Other than the interactions between coastal land forms and physical processes there is also the addition of modification of these landforms through anthropogenic sources (see human modifications). Some of the anthropogenic sources of modification have been put in place to halt erosion or prevent harbors from filling up with sediment. In order to assist community planners, local governments, and national governments a variety of models have been developed to predict the changes of beach sediment transport at coastal locations. Typically, during large wave events, the sediment gets transported off the beach face a deposited offshore generating a sandbar. Once the significant wave event has diminished, the sediment then gets slowly transported back onshore.  History  In the mid-1970s a significant amount of attention was paid to coastal sediment transport. In part, due to the National Sea Grant College Program and the U.S. Congress Mandated Sea Grant Act of 1976. One of the research areas included \\"the development and the experimental verification of hydrodynamic laws governing the transport of marine sediments in the flow fields occurring in coastal waters.\\" From this request for research, the Office of Sea Grant reviewed, accepted, and funded the Nearshore Sediment Transport Study (NSTS). Due to unforeseen complications the NSTS conducted only two major field experiments and a validation experiment. This was a significant contribution to the field of coastal sediment transport and helped initialize a great deal of future research.  Glossary  ; shore : zone between the water's edge at normal low tide and the landward limit of effective wave action. ; shoreline : the water's edge, migrating up and down with the tide. ; foreshore : exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide. ; backshore : extending above normal high tide level. ; nearshore zone : between shoreline and the line where the waves begin to break. ; beach : an accumulation of loose sediment sometimes confined to the backshore but often extending across the foreshore as well.  Beach profile measurements  A variety of measurements are used to determine the beach profile, sediment grain size, and various other important parameters to determine what is influencing coastal sediment transport. Below are a few of the multitude.  Coastal research amphibious buggy (CRAB)  A three- wheeled vehicle deployed at the beach to measure the beach profile. (more information can be found at http://frf.usace.army.mil/vehicles2.stm)  Emory beach profile measurement  A simple depiction of measuring a beach profile and compiling a median grain size. In order to determine what the profile of a beach looks like, one method for determination is the Emory Beach Profiling Method. Initiating a benchmark, the researcher establishes a control point to start the surveys at. Typically this is far enough away from the swash zone that large changes in elevation will not occur during the sampling time. Once the initial benchmark is established, the researcher will take the Emory sampling device and measure the change in elevation over the distance the device is covering. Then, they will pick up the device and move it to the end point of their last survey, and so on. Until they reach the shoreline. Typically this is done during neap tide (see Tide for more information on neap tide).  Grain size determination  Since the sand grain diameters can vary throughout the entire beach the median grain size is used to determine sediment fall velocity. Determining sediment fall velocity allows the determination of what sediment is left where...Dean, Robert G., and Robert A. Dalrymple. Coastal Processes : With Engineering Applications.

Life  Winfried Orthmann studied the ancient history of the Middle East, classical archaeology and Assyriology from 1954 to 1961 at universities in Munich, Berlin and Ankara. He received his doctoral degree in 1961 promovierte at the Free University of Berlin (thesis title: Keramik der Fr√ºhen Bronzezeit aus Inneranatolien). After his studies, he was an instructor at the German Archaeological Institute in Istanbul. From 1966 to 1969 he received a scholarship from the German Research Foundation (DFG) to support his habilitation, which took place in 1969 at Saarland University with his publication of Untersuchungen zur sp√§thethitischen Kunst (Investigations of Late Hittite Art). In 1971 his was appointed as a scientific advisor and professor at Saarland University, where he remained from 1971 to 1994 as a professor for Near Eastern archaeology. From 1994 to 2000 Orthmann was a professor and dean for art, classical and ancient studies at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. He became a professor emeritus at the end of the summer semester in 2000 and remains professionally active to this day. His research focus includes Syrian archaeology from the third to first century BCE and the archaeology of the southern Caucasus region in the early and middle Bronze Age.  Work and projects  Travels in near eastern countries and excavation campaigns in Ilica (Turkey) and in Mumbaqat (Syria) since 1973-1974 supported his work as a specialist in archaeology, particularly in the area of Hittite culture. After the death of Anton Moortgat in 1977, who was a professor of near eastern archaeology at the Free University of Berlin, Orthmann continued the excavations of the ancient settlement at Tell Chuera (in northeast Syria) from 1982 to 1983 together with Ursula Moortgat-Correns of Berlin. As of 1986, he assumed sole responsibility for the excavations. The project was relocated to the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in 1994. During the 1996 campaign, his team excavated parts of a large temple complex in the southeastern part of the city and parts of a palace in the west of the city in strata dated to the third millennium BCE. A larger building complex from the middle Assyrian period (13th century BCE) was also excavated. Until 1997 Orthmann was also responsible for work in the Alazani valley in eastern Georgia on behalf of the German Research Foundation (DFG) with the objective of completely excavating a large grave mound (kurgan originating in the last third of the third millennium BCE near the Alazani River. Excavations were also performed under his direction by an expedition from Saarland University at Halawa (Syria) in the Euphrates Valley from 1975 to 1986. He is a full member of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI).  Publications  * Die Keramik der Fr√ºhen Bronzezeit aus Inneranatolien. Berlin 1963. * Der Alte Orient.

Education  He studied mathematics during Cephalonia's occupation by the French in 1808, under the direction of Ecole polytechnique's alumnus Charles Dupin, a very good mathematician, who was a navy officer at that time. Then, under Lord North government on Ionian Islands, his talent was remarked and he was sent to study mathematics in Ecole polytechnique, under Biot, Cauchy, Poisson and Fourier. Then he went to England for a study trip, and went back to Corfu to establish the Ionian Academy, where he created the first course of modern mathematics in Greek language. He made contributions to the formalisation of analysis, which were published in 1828 in the Journal des Savants. He taught an entire generation of Greek mathematicians, and is thus seen as the founder of the modern Greek analysis school.

Hashemi had a 9-year relationship with the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), beginning soon after his arrival in the UK in 1984. Hashemi and his brother Cyrus Hashemi played a role in the 1980 October Surprise affair (Jamshid later testified to the House October Surprise Task Force in 1992) and in the mid-1980s Iran-Contra affair. Career Hashemi and his brother Cyrus Hashemi supported the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and Jamshid was appointed to oversee the national radio network, where he worked with Mehdi Karroubi's brother Hassan. In late 1979 Jamshid flew to London at his brother's invitation, where he met John Shaheen. Shaheen procured a multiple-entry US visa for Jamshid within a day, and Jamshid flew to the US on 1 January 1980. Hashemi and his brother Cyrus Hashemi went on to play a role in the 1980 October Surprise affair (Jamshid later testified to the House October Surprise Task Force in 1992) and in the Iran-Contra affair. Upon arriving in the US after the Revolution, Hashemi set up RRC Co Inc in Stamford, Connecticut, which Hashemi described in an affidavit as \\"an import-export company ... (which) originally dealt in commodities such as rice and sugar, construction machinery parts and Oriental rugs\\". Towards the end of 1980 Hashemi was approached by a contact on behalf of the Iranian Air Force in regards to acquiring aircraft spare parts. The company shipped millions of dollars' worth of spare parts and related goods to Iran, with billing handled via a London office. RRC's operations ceased in late 1981 over a dispute between partners regarding allocation of profits.Kenneth R. Timmerman (1988), Fanning the Flames: Guns, Greed & Geopolitics in the Gulf War, CHAPTER 6: OPEN FOR BUSINESS In July 1984 the Hashemis were tipped off by the CIA that the FBI was in pursuit of them for arms deals violating the Iran arms embargo; both settled in Britain, with Cyrus dying of a rare leukemia in 1986. Soon after his move to the UK in 1984, Jamshid Hashemi developed a relationship with the UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) which would last nine years. Hashemi broke off the relationship in 1993 after the UK Government refused to issue him a British passport.Richard Norton-Taylor and William Raynor, The Guardian, 6 February 1999, Jailed 'go-between' on UK-Iran arms deals is freed to keep MI6 secrets out of court At one time Hashemi gave the UK Conservative Party \\"¬£55,000 after meeting Margaret Thatcher at the home of the then foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe.\\" Hashemi deals that MI6 approved of included the supply of ¬£350 million worth of Silkworm missiles from China to Iran in 1987 (the agency had supported this by sending an agent to China in 1985 to help arrange the deal) and the transfer of Portuguese 155mm ammunition. In July 1997 Hashemi was arrested in Dublin whilst travelling to the US for a second triple heart bypass. He was released in February 1999, having pleaded guilty to three fraud charges and one of using a false passport, while four charges were dropped to avoid UK security matters being aired in open court. At the time of his release The Guardian said that \\"A source close to the case yesterday described MI6 as lucky.\\" The judge in the case described Hashemi as a \\"ruthless international conman\\", with the Serious Fraud Office accusing Hashemi of setting up companies to defraud suppliers of at least ¬£3m using non-existent commodity deals with Iran. The judge also noted that the three-year sentence would have been longer had Hashemi not had a record of supplying \\"valuable information\\" to MI6, as attested in court by Hashemi's anonymous case officers.

Career Mosh began building her modeling portfolio at the age of 17, networking on Modelmayhem.com to set up photo shoots with local photographers while juggling high school, a job and an internship.

History 43rd Regiment, North Carolina Infantry: 43rd Infantry Regiment was assembled at Camp Mangum, near Raleigh, North Carolina, in March, 1862. Its members were from counties in Mecklenburg, Wilson, Halifax, Edgecombe, Warren, Union, and Anson Roster of NC's 43rd Infantry . During the war the 43rd was assigned to General Junius Daniel's, Robert F. Hoke's, and Bryan Grimes' Brigade. It fought in the Seven Days' Battles and saw action at Goldsboro, Gettysburg, Plymouth, Drewry's Bluff, and Cold Harbor. The regiment was then involved in Early's Shenandoah Valley operations and the Appomattox Campaign. It was organized with 1,066 officers and men, lost twenty-six percent of the 572 engaged at Gettysburg, and had 4 killed and 13 wounded at Plymouth. On April 9, 1865, it surrendered 9 officers and 164 men.43rd North Carolina Regiment National Park Service Malvern Hill In the Battle of Malvern Hill the 43rd was ordered to occupy a road near the James River, where it was exposed to galling fire from the Federal gunboats, and from the Union artillery batteries on Malvern Hill in front. However, the regiment was not actively engaged. The 43rd remained at Drewry's Bluff protecting Richmond during the Sharpsburg Campaign, and was later sent to Kinston, NC in the spring of 1863 in order to help relieve Washington, NC from the federal occupation. Gettysburg From the public monument at Gettysburg: Forty-third North Carolina Regiment, Daniel's Brigade Rodes's Division, Ewell's Corps, Army of Northern Virginia. Thomas Stephen Kenan, Colonel; William Gaston Lewis, Lieutenant Colonel; Walter Jones Boggan, Major. As they approached the field of battle on the morning of July 1, the 43rd North Carolina, along with the rest of Daniel's Brigade, heard the distant booming of cannon. Early in the afternoon the regiment moved to the right and onto open ground where they were met by a furious fire. Their steady progress was checked by the deep railroad cut, but subsequent assaults were successful in breaking the Union line. Having suffered heavily, the regiment rested for the night west of town. The next morning the 43rd supported a battery just north of the Seminary. Shelling from guns on the nearby heights inflicted some losses. Toward evening the Regiment took up a position on the southern edge of town. Before daybreak on July 3, the 43d moved to the extreme left of the Confederate line to take part in an assault on Culp's Hill. Passing this point and advancing under heavy fire, they occupied earthworks abandoned by Union troops. Attempting to push beyond the works, the regiment was exposed to a most severe fire of canister, shrapnel and shell at short range. During the attack Col. Kenan was wounded and taken from the field and command passed to Lt. Col. Lewis. The Regiment retired to this point an remained exposed and under fire until ordered to recross Rock Creek in the early evening. \\"All that men could do, was done nobly\\"43rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment The monument to the 43rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment is southeast of Gettysburg on East Confederate Avenue.

The command was given \\"The Thanks of the Confederate Congress\\" for their success. The regiment then aided in the attacks on New Bern, NC and Washington, NC. They returned to Virginia in May 1864. Snicker's Gap The 43rd North Carolina Infantry was part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864, which included Battle of Cool Spring or Snicker's Gap. As Jubal Early's Confederate troops were leaving the area around Washington, DC, pursuing Federal forces caused a battle in a small gap in the Blue Ridge mountains. \\"The troops then moved toward the Valley of Virginia, and crossed the Blue Ridge at Snicker‚Äôs Gap on 17 July, the Union troops slowly following and an additional force threatening the flank of the Confederate right.

Appomattox Courthouse The 43rd Regiment, North Carolina State Troops, participated in the Battle of Appomattox Court House, and surrendered on April 9, 1865, with 9 officers and 164 men. General Bryan Grimes' Division was composed of four brigades, and on April 10, 1865, there were present for duty 1,659 officers and men, with 722 .58 calibre muskets among the men, 11 more muskets in the brigade trains, and 30 more muskets in the division trains. There were thus twenty regiments with 722 muskets in their hands, an average of 36 muskets to each regiment and less than four to each company, with 32 rounds of ammunition for each musket with the troops, and forty in the brigade ordnance wagons and another fifteen rounds per musket in the division trains, a total of about 87 rounds per musket, enough to put up a pretty stiff fight. 722 muskets among 1,659 men represents the fighting strength of Grimes‚Äô division at Appomattox Court House at the time of the surrender.James R.

He writes, \\"there is plenty of this Confederate money and it may be no count if I was to lay it all up.\\" In a 26 October 1863 letter he discusses eating beef for nearly every meal and his longing for milk or vegetables. In an 18 July 1864 letter addressed from Harpers Ferry, Barnes discusses marching to Sharpsburg, skirmishing with the 6th Yankee corps, and marching on \\"Washington city.\\" In addition, Barnes writes that the unit had marched some 3,000 miles and that \\"our brigade is not as large now as it once was.\\" He notes a decision not to attack Washington because \\"finding them so well fortified our Genl. commanding . . . thought he would make too grate [sic] a sacrifice of life to undertake to enter the town.\\" In passing, Barnes also writes, \\"tell father that Bennett has got old Francis P. Blair's sword. He is United States Postmaster and a Black hearted notorious abolitionist.\\" * Beavans, William. William Beavans Diary and Letters. 1861.

It was originally designed as an emulation of the Nord Lead 2 synthesizer, and has since become a unique Virtual Studio Technology instrument and one of the most downloaded VST plug-ins of all time. The software used to be a DirectX instrument plugin, but became solely VSTi from version 1.08 on. Version 1.13 was the first version to introduce a native 64-bit version of the plugin.  History  Synth1 was first released as a DXi plug-in on October 9, 2002. It was updated to support the VSTi format six days later, on October 15, 2002. Version 1.02 was released on October 27, 2002, and dealt with some of the major bugs that arose from converting the software to VST, such as a memory leak and the LFO waveform selector not working. The next three versions dealt primarily with compatibility issues. 1.05a was a major update which added the ability to modulate the FM parameter, added fine tuning to the VCOs, added synchronization to the LFOs, and fixed quality issues with the ADSR envelope. The next version would not be released until September 20, 2003. Version 1.06 added a unison mode, an automatic portamento, and new Voltage-controlled filter parameters. This was the first version when Synth1 became noticeably different from the Nord Lead 2, upon which it was based. Version 1.07, released May 3, 2006, added new parameters and effects, primarily the chorus/flanger, as well as cleaning up the GUI. 1.07 would be the last version with DXi support, as version 1.08, released on April 23, 2010, discontinued the DXi version and removed the now unnecessary installer. One week later, on the first of May, 2010, the now solely VSTi program was updated to version 1.09, which added a Phase Control function and expanded the number of voices in the polyphony and unison modes. May 2010 would contain the last of Synth1's updates for Windows, with the bug-fix version 1.10 released on the fourth, version 1.11 on the ninth, and the current version 1.12 on the twenty-third of that month. Version 1.11 added a sub-oscillator and version 1.12 added the ability to read sound banks from .zip files. The last update, version 1.13 beta, was released October 2, 2011, and allowed Synth1 to function on Macintosh operating systems. Toda announced on October 28, 2012 that he intended to release an iPhone/iPad version of Synth 1 \\"by the Spring of next year\\", although there have been no version updates or blog posts since.  Synthesis  Synth1 is a digital synthesizer based on the Clavia Nord Lead 2. Since the Nord Lead 2 is also a digital synthesizer, Synth1 is able to emulate it more closely than digital synthesizers that aim to emulate analogue synthesis. Synth1 combines the common sound synthesis method of subtractive synthesis with FM synthesis, with the first oscillator having a parameter for frequency modulation. Structurally, the software behaves as though it were a modular analogue synthesizer. MIDI from the host music sequencer goes into the arpeggiator, which then sends the final MIDI information to all active voices, which each consist of the oscillators, filter, and amplifier. The LFOs exist outside of the chain, and can modulate certain parameters of the oscillators, filter, and amplifier. The information from the voices, after the LFO modulation has been added, is then sent to the mixer. From the mixer, the sound information is sent through the equalizer, delay, and chorus modules, after which the sound data is output to be turned into audible sound by the sound card associated with the host program.  Specifications  * Three oscillators, one with a FM modulation, one with ring modulation and synchronization, and one sub-oscillator. Osc 1 can operate as detuned supersaw. * One filter section, with distortion. Four filter types: two high-pass, one low-pass, and a band-pass filter. * Two assignable LFOs, which can be synchronized to a host tempo. * An arpeggiator which can be synchronized to a host tempo. * Several built-in effects, including a tempo delay, distortion, phaser, and chorus/flanger. * Polyphony, monophony, and legato voices. * Unison and portamento modes * 32 notes polyphony * Automation * Low CPU usage  Recognition  Synth1 is the all-time most downloaded VST plug-in on KVR Audio, and was ranked number 5 on MusicRadar's list of \\"The 27 best free VST plug-ins in the world today\\".

The fifteenth named storm and sixth typhoon in the western Pacific that year, Krovanh originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough on August 13\\\\. Despite rather favorable conditions, the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18\\\\. However, these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later. Intensification was rather rapid upon the storm's reformation ‚Äì the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later. Shortly after, Krovanh made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm, though it was able to restrengthen over warm waters. Once again at typhoon intensity, Krovanh clipped Haiyan before moving over the Leizhou Peninsula on its way to a final landfall near C·∫©m Ph·∫£, Vietnam on August 25\\\\. Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred as Krovanh moved across northern Vietnam, where the storm met its demise the following day. Krovanh first struck the Philippines, resulting in heavy rainfall and displacing approximately 1,000 families. The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person. Krovanh's effects were much more severe in China. In Hong Kong, eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon's outer rainbands. However, Guangdong Province, Hainan Province, and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted. The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi. In those three regions combined, 13,000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large swath of farmland was damaged. Two people were killed in China and economic losses approximated at ¬•2.1 billion (US$253 million). Due to its positioning and track, of all areas in Vietnam only the country's more northern regions were impacted by Krovanh. Flash flooding occurred in those regions, and 1,000 homes were flattened. One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam. Overall, the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons. Meteorological history The origin of Typhoon Krovanh can be traced back to an area of persistent convection well east of Chuuk State on August 13\\\\. Over the course of the day the disturbance gradually consolidated within favorable atmospheric conditions, and at 1800 UTC that day the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the system to have organized sufficiently to be classified as a tropical depression. Shower activity was suppressed by a nearby upper-level low for much of the storm's early existence; however, at 0600 UTC on August 15, the system was classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as a tropical depression. The depression tracked northwestward under the influence of a nearby ridge. Strengthening and development of the tropical cyclone was very minimal over the next few days, and on August 18, both tracking agencies discontinued monitoring the system due to the lack of an identifiable low-level circulation center. Redevelopment of the disturbance was a possibility following its degeneration, and on August 19, convection once again increased, prompting the JTWC to resume monitoring the system as a tropical depression at 0900 UTC, with the JMA following suit nine hours later. Due to slight wind shear, the depression's circulation center remained slightly displaced from the stronger convection. At 0600 UTC on August 20, the JTWC determined that the disturbance had intensified to reach tropical storm status. Upon the 1200 UTC upgrade to such an intensity by the JMA, the tropical cyclone was assigned the name Krovanh. Subsequently, following reclassification, Krovanh began to quickly intensify as it tracked in a somewhat southwest bearing. By August 21, the tropical storm had begun to develop a banding eye feature. At 0600 UTC that day, the JMA upgraded Krovanh to severe tropical storm intensity, whilst the JTWC indicated that the storm intensified into a typhoon. On August 22, the JMA reassessed Krovanh as a typhoon and determined that the storm had reached its peak intensity with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Meanwhile, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have peaked with one-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h (105 mph); this was followed by the storm making landfall on Luzon, just north of Palanan, Isabela, at 1115 UTC later that day. alt=Image of a tropical cyclone to the right of a group of small landmasses. The tropical cyclone is characterized by a sprawling mass of spiralingclouds, though no eye is evident. Land interaction during Krovanh's passage of Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000 UTC on August 22, Krovanh was classified as only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just four hours later the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August 24, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August 25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity and indicated that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on C·∫©m Ph·∫£, Vietnam at approximately 1500 UTC on August 25\\\\. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August 26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi. Preparations and impact=China Tropical Storm Krovanh in the South China Sea on August 24 As Krovanh was approaching the Philippines, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau cautioned the residents of the island against strong winds and warning ships in the Bashi Channel. After the typhoon entered the South China Sea, sea warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh moved closer to the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No. 1 on August 23, which was upgraded to a Strong Wind Signal No. 3 at around noon the following day.

Other rainfall totals of at least 70 mm (2.75 in) were measured over a majority of the country. Gusts peaked at 144 km/h (89 mph) on Cheung Chau. The strong winds and gusts uprooted trees and caused scaffolding at an estate to collapse. In the province, 11 people were injured due to effects from Krovanh. A ferry service and four bus routes were temporarily suspended following the storm. Guangdong and Hainan provinces, as well as Guangxi, were the regions of China most heavily impacted by Krovanh. In Zhanjiang, Guangdong, two people were killed. Economic losses from western Guangdong alone amounted to ¬•1.2 billion (US$144 million). In Hainan, heavy rainfall was reported, peaking at 394 mm (15.51 in) in Jinjiang. Roughly 1,700 homes collapsed and 16 reservoirs were contaminated and destroyed.

Other high rainfall totals included 263 mm (10.35 in) in Baguio and 203 mm (7.99 in) in Iba, Zambales. The flooding rains displaced 1000 families on the archipelago and killed a girl. Although full damage reports were never released, damages were estimated at ‚Ç± 4.3 million (US $73,000) and of \\"severe extent\\". Typhoon Krovanh was the strongest tropical cyclone to affect Vietnam in 2003. One person was killed in M√≥ng C√°i after their house collapsed. Hundreds of other homes were unroofed and traffic was halted. Trees were also uprooted and power outages resulted from strong winds, particularly in Qu·∫£ng Ninh Province.

History  J-Keys, born in South Sacramento and Money Mike born in Hammond, Louisiana both name church and family as having a huge influence on the development of their musical talents. Graduates of the Los Angeles Recording School in Hollywood, CA, the duos first full production credit came in 2009 on Before I Self Destruct for rapper 50 Cent. After further work in 2010 on hip hop albums such Dom Kennedy‚Äôs From the Westside with Love, II, Redman'sReggie and Sheek Louch‚Äôs Donnie G: Don Gorilla, The Futuristiks became a prominent production team for hip-hop, R&B; and Gospel artists. Proving to be a life- altering year for The Futuristiks, in 2011, their work ranged from hip hop records with chart-topping artists Eminem, Royce da 5‚Äô9‚Äù and Ras Kass as well as other known acts such as Strong Arm Steady and Mitchy Slick. In 2011, they also produced rapper Problem‚Äôs \\"Last Love\\" for the unreleased mixtape Plan B which received video spins on BET‚Äôs 106 & Park making to the Top Ten Countdown and other video mediums. Moreover, in 2011, they also produced the lead singles for Dom Kennedy‚Äôs The Original Dom Kennedy and Skeme‚Äôs mixtapes The Statement and Before My Next Statement. Continuing their catalog growth, the production duo began working with R&B; artists Jeremih on the highly anticipated Late Nights with Jeremih Mixtape, as well as debut projects for other R&B; artists TeeFlii and Elijah Blake. Not leaving their hip hop roots, in 2012, the pair produced tracks for rappers T.I., Freddie Gibbs, Fat Joe, Bad Lucc, 8Ball, Jay Rock, Curren$y and OverDoz. The Futuristiks made the Billboard Top 100 in 2012 for their production on Capitol Records Tito Lopez‚Äôs song Mama Proud.

As their sound developed and territory expanded in 2013, the Futuristiks were nominated for their first Recording Academy Grammy Award in the Best Rap Album category for their contribution on Lupe Fiasco‚Äôs Food & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album, Pt. 1. Lupe's II topped Billboard's Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums and Rap Albums charts, while debuting and peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.

Ahmann (September 10, 1931 ‚Äì December 31, 2001) was an American Catholic layman and civil rights activist. He was a leader of the Catholic Church's involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, and in 1960 founded and became the executive director of the National Catholic Council for Interracial Justice. By initiating the 1963 National Conference on Religion and Race, Ahmann worked to establish the civil rights movement as a moral cause. He was one of four white men who joined the \\"Big Six\\" to organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He gave a speech during the march that preceded the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech of Martin Luther King Jr. Following the Civil Rights Movement, he directed several civil rights and Catholic service initiatives. He is not commonly thought of when thinking of the civil rights movement but has been said to have acted as a catalyst for the Catholic Church's involvement in the movement.  Early life and education Mathew Ahmann was born on September 10, 1931 in St. Cloud, Minnesota, to Norbert Ahmann, a dentist, and Clothilda Ahmann, n√©e Hall, a nurse.Murray, Paul T. \\"From the Sidelines to the Front Lines: Mathew Ahmann Leads American Catholics into the Civil Rights Movement.\\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society 107.1 (2014): 77,115,8. ProQuest. Web. 13 May 2015. Ahmann's grandfather, Mathew Hall, was a German-American immigrant and St. Cloud businessman. Ahmann was the oldest of three brothers; religion was a large part of everyday life as they attended Catholic school and religious retreats. They each attended Saint John's Preparatory School in Collegeville, Minnesota. Ahmann grew up a Boy Scout and playing music in a band. Ahmann studied social science at Saint John's University for three years. After graduating in 1952, he entered a master's degree program in sociology at the University of Chicago. Ahmann's brother David recalled: Ahmann's intent was to finish his master's program but he left to focus on his work with the civil rights movement.  Civil rights movement  Ahmann worked in Chicago for several years as director of the Chicago Catholic Interracial Council. In 1960, he founded and became the executive director of the National Catholic Council for Interracial Justice. As director, Ahmann organized the National Conference on Religion and Race, the first national meeting on civil rights between Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish leaders. The conference was held at the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago on January 14‚Äì17, 1963. Ahmann scheduled it to coincide with the Emancipation Proclamation's 100th anniversary. Ahmann said his goal for the conference was to: Leaders from 78 denominations attended, and speakers included Martin Luther King Jr., Sargent Shriver, and Abraham Joshua Heschel. One attendee said it was an achievement in itself that Protestant, Catholic Jewish and Orthodox leaders had even come together: \\"A total of 1,000 delegates ‚Äî about 750 official delegates and 250 observer delegates\\" attended.Mays, Benjamin E. \\"MY VIEW: The National Conference on Religion and Race.\\" New Pittsburgh Courier (1959-1965), National edition ed.: 11. Feb 02 1963. ProQuest. Web. 15 May 2015 . After Ahmann's speech, Heschel invited Ahmann to the stage and said, \\"We are here because of the faith of a 33-year-old Catholic layman.\\" Heschel kissed Ahmann on the head, and Ahmann received a standing ovation. A journalist who attended concluded that even if the attendees did nothing after they left the conference, they would never be the same. He also explained that after the conference it was expected that committees of the three religions would form on local and regional levels but in order to be successful they needed to be more unanimous in action, not independent. Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C., 1963 Ahmann was asked by organizers of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom to find a Catholic bishop who would serve as a Catholic chairman for the march. Unable to find a willing bishop, Ahmann himself volunteered to join the organizing committee and make a speech at the march. Ahmann, as the Catholic presence, along with white leaders Walter Reuther, Eugene Carson Blake, and Joachim Prinz, joined the original \\"Big Six\\" to organize the march as the \\"Big Ten.\\" At the August 28 March on Washington, Ahmann gave a speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He asked: Ahmann's speech preceded King's \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. In 1965, Ahmann urged all United States diocese clergy to attend the Selma to Montgomery marches, in response to King's call for participation. In the same year, he gave the commencement speech at the College of Saint Benedict, where he encouraged women to fight for rights. In 1967, Ahmann wrote a letter to the incarcerated King, saying, \\"Our conference sends you greetings while you serve sentence for your witness for humanity, dignity and justice.\\" The King Center has uploaded this telegram to their online archives for the public to view. Ahmann continued to show his support to King and the movement in 1967 when he sent him a telegram on the 10-year anniversary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to congratulate them on all of the work they had done and continued to do for human rights.  Later activities and death  Ahmann worked with the National Catholic Council for Interracial Justice until 1968. In 1969, he moved to Texas and became the executive director of the Commission on Church and Society for the Archdiocese of San Antonio. During the 1972 presidential election, Ahmann worked for vice-presidential candidate Sargent Shriver. He then worked for 16 years as the associate director of government relations for Catholic Charities USA in Washington, D.C. He was also an executive committee member of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Ahmann died of cancer on December 31, 2001, at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. A memorial Mass was held at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Washington, D.C, on January 12, 2002. William L. Taylor remarked, \\"Mr. Ahmann was a quiet voice of conscience in the civil rights movement, who helped make the Leadership Conference the effective organization that it is today.\\" In October 2013, Ahmann was posthumously awarded the Colman J. Barry Award for Distinguished Contributions to Religion and Society from Saint John's University. Personal life In 1954, Ahmann married Margaret C. Ahmann. Together they raised six children.

The road begins at a junction with Interstate 10 (I-10) and U.S. Highway 67 (US 67) in Pecos County west of Fort Stockton and extends northward through the town of Coyanosa before ending at State Highway 18 (SH 18) in Ward County south of Monahans. The road has an interchange with US 285 northeast of Fort Stockton. Before the road was established, TxDOT had previously assigned the road's numerical designation to two other roads in eastern Texas. Route description FM 1776 begins at I-10 Exit 248 as a northward extension of the US 67 roadway which approaches from the southwest from Alpine and merges with I-10. The two-lane road continues to the north beneath the US 285 underpass and reaches Coyanosa. North of Coyanosa, FM 1776 joins and follows FM 1450 for a stretch southeast of the city of Pecos before turning off to the northeast. The road then leaves Pecos County at the Pecos River and crosses into Ward County where it intersects FM 1927 south of Pyote. The road then proceeds to the northeast crossing FM 1219 between Royalty and Wickett before terminating at SH 18 approximately south of Monahans. FM 1776 provides the most direct access to Monahans and points further east along I-20 from Alpine and more southern communities including Lajitas, Study Butte, and Terlingua. FM 1776 has a rural major collector functional class as rated by TxDOT. The road has a speed limit in Pecos County except for a section between US 285 and Coyanosa and a speed limit of in Ward County. The road has average annual daily traffic (AADT) counts ranging from a low of 440 vehicles along the section between I-10 and US 285 to a high of 960 vehicles between Coyanosa and FM 1450\\\\. TxDOT projects these numbers to increase by 2030 to a low of 760 vehicles between I-10 and US 285 to a high of 1460 vehicles between FM 1450 and the Pecos River. Peak hour truck traffic ranges from 23.5 percent between Ward County Road 94 and SH 18 to 39 percent between US 285 and Pecos County Road 72. History FM 1776 was originally designated northward along a former alignment of US 96 between SH 184 at Bronson in Sabine County and SH 21 at Ford's Corner in San Augustine County on September 19, 1951. The former road became an extension of FM 1 on October 14, 1954. FM 1776 was briefly designated on February 17, 1955 along a Grimes County route from FM 149 in Richards southeastward toward Dacus to the Montgomery County line. The designation of the route did not survive the year before being combined with FM 1486 on November 2 of that year. The current route was designated on February 24, 1956 between FM 1450 and SH 18\\\\. The road was extended southward through Coyanosa to US 67 and US 290, the predecessor route to I-10 in much of western Texas, on May 6, 1964.

At an elevation of , it is the country's highest station with a scheduled passenger stop (although the now-closed Waiouru Railway Station is higher). About north of the station the railway performs the convoluted dance that is the Raurimu Spiral, one of New Zealand's most impressive feats of engineering. History Originally the station and town were called Waimarino (calm waters). In 1926, the New Zealand Railways renamed the railway station as National Park. This name had come into common usage, due to the station's proximity to Tongariro National Park, and it also served to avoid confusion with other places called Waimarino. The opening of the Main Trunk Line in 1908 created a vast opportunity to log and mill the large trees in the native forests with 30 saw mills and associated bush tramways established in the National Park area alone. With the arrival of caterpillar tractors in the 1930s, the extraction process was accelerated with National Park station having one of the greatest throughputs of timber in New Zealand. Today, only one mill is still operating. In the 1960s, National Park became the railhead for all the heavy equipment and machinery for the Tongariro Power Scheme Development with local pumice roads substantially upgraded to take the heavy traffic.

The goods sold are cheaper than other places. They are mainly run by the elderly and the homeless. Some sell products collected from bins or donated goods. Background There are seven dawn markets and they are mainly located in relatively poorer areas of Hong Kong (such as Sham Shui Po and Yuen Long). However, only two of the seven Dawn Markets are legal. Different Dawn Markets sell different goods. The Dawn Market in Mong Kok mainly sells goldfish, marine animals and appliances (like small aquarium and pipes) while the market in Aberdeen sells frozen fish. Tai Po Dawn Market sells fresh vegetables and fruits cultivated by the elderly. The dawn market in Sham Shui Po sells cheap clothes, household utensils and toys collected by elderly. The market at Hung Hom provides clothes, cosmetics, shoes and accessories. Sheung Shui Dawn Market is another legal market that includes nearly 200 stalls selling vegetables and fruits. Fresh fish can also be found. The hawkers in these areas will dismiss at the break of dawn to hide from inspectors. Sellers Sellers in the Dawn Market are usually the underprivileged elderly and housewives. They sell many of those products to earn a living, though they don't always earn much from the trades. Some housewives take part in selling after their children go to school, while some prefer taking their children with them. Housewives go all out to earn more through selling, as their families have limited domestic expenses while they have to take good care of their children. They choose to sell at those areas because the living standard in those areas are comparatively lower than other areas, where the residents are relatively poorer than those who live in other places. Apart from that, gaining a strong sense of belonging to those places is another factor that motivates them to sell products there. They help each other whenever in need and they will alert each other to run away when the Hawker Control Team comes. Problems=Hegemony Hegemony refers to imperial dominance. It is the consequence of the fact that the government only work with single property developer. They have signed agreements to preserve the right of gaining profit of the developer which finally causes the hegemony of the developer. The developer carries out high land-value policy, and monopolizes land management These actions cause the increase of shop's rent and even the farmers' market's rent. It also introduced chain stores into housing estates. Eventually the price of necessities rises in places such as Yuen Long, those relatively poorer areas. Therefore, residents there cannot afford the price of food and other goods for daily life. Dawn Market turns out to be a helpful platform for those people to buy goods in acceptable and reasonable price to live one's life.

However, the government also concerns the hygiene and risks in these illegal markets. For example, unlicensed hawkers selling goods in public places will affect the cityscape and posed dangers to other road users. Especially when the Hawker Control Team staff work overnight shift to tackle unlicensed hawking activities,http://www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pleasant_environment/hawker/control.html Food and Environmental Hygiene Department the unlicensed hawkers will panic and escape from the staff, which means they will run with a trolley of products in the street.

History The route was established by 1942 as a new primary routing from US 52 in Effingham, to SC 51 in Evergreen. In 1947 or 1948, SC 327 was extended east as a new primary routing from Evergreen to US 76/US 301 in Winona. By 1952, the Effingham to Evergreen section was paved, and later extended east to Clausen a year later; by 1958 the entire route was paved. By 1958, SC 327 was rerouted from Claussen to US 76/US 301 in Mars Bluff; the old alignment was downgraded to secondary roads: National Cemetery Road (S-21-13) and Paper Mill Road (S-21-24). In 1971, SC 327 was extended north, overlapping with US 76/US 301 then north along existing roads to I-95. In 1992, the US 76/US 301 to I-95 section was widened to a divided four-lane highway.

It was developed by the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (NC-PTSD), a section of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, in 2006. It has been spread by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), the American Psychological Association (APA) and many others. It was developed in a two-day intensive collaboration, involving more than 25 disaster mental health researchers, an online survey of the first cohort that used PFA and repeated reviews of the draft.http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/manuals/psych-first-aid.asp  Definition  According to the NC-PTSD, psychological first aid is an evidence-informed modular approach for assisting people in the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism to reduce initial distress and to foster short and long-term adaptive functioning. It was used by non-mental health experts, such as responders and volunteers. Other characteristics include non- intrusive pragmatic care and assessing needs. PFA does not necessarily involve discussion of the traumatic event.

It was intended to reduce the incidences of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a major disaster. PTSD is now widely known to be debilitating; sufferers experience avoidance, flashbacks, hyper-vigilance, and numbness. Debriefing procedures were made a requirement after a disaster, with a desire to prevent people from developing PTSD. The idea behind it was to promote emotional processing by encouraging recollection of the event. Debriefing has origins with the military, where sessions were intended to boost morale and reduce distress after a mission. Debriefing was done in a single session with seven stages: introduction, facts, thoughts and impressions, emotional reactions, normalization, planning for future, and disengagement. Debriefing was found to be at best, ineffective, and at worst, harmful. There are several theories as to why debriefing increased incidents of PTSD. First, those who were likely to develop PTSD were not helped by a single session. Second, being re-exposed too soon to the trauma could lead to retraumatization. Exposure therapy in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) allows the person to adjust to the stimuli before slowly increasing severity. Debriefing did not allow for this. Also, normal distress was seen to be pathological after a debriefing and those who had been through a trauma thought they had a mental disorder because they were upset. Debriefing assumes that everyone reacts the same way to a trauma, and anyone who deviates from that path, is pathological. But there are many ways to cope with a trauma, especially so soon after it happens. PFA seems to address many of the issues in debriefing. It is not compulsory and can be done in multiple sessions and links those who need more help to services. It deals with practical issues which are often more pressing and create stress. It also improves self efficacy by letting people cope their own way. PFA has attempted to be culturally sensitive, but whether it is or not has not been shown. However, a drawback is the lack of empirical evidence. While it is based on research, it is not proven by research. Like the debriefing method, it has become widely popular without testing.

Local lore has it that the three-and-a- half-story house was built for his would-be bride who later refused to marry him, giving rise to the house's popular name, \\"O'Donnell's Folly.\\" Between 1907 and 1937, it was home to Josephine Pinckney; both the Charleston Poetry Society and the Society for the Preservation of Spirituals were formed at the house during her ownership. It is a classic example of a side hall plan; the house has large, adjacent rooms on the south side with a piazza and a stair hall that runs along the north side of the house. A carriage house in the baronial style was added along the rear property line in 1888 by Thomas R. McGahan. In 1987, the house was for sale for $750,000, and the Preservation Society of Charleston considered purchasing it. The Society was interested in using the house as a museum house and as its headquarters, and the neighborhood initially supported the plans. Later, the neighborhood changed its position because of worries about parking, and the membership of the Society was split on the proposal. In April 1987, The Society dropped its plans. The house sold for $7.2 million in June 2007 to James Pallotta, a part owner of the Boston Celtics. At the time, the seven-bedroom, 9,700 square foot house's price was the highest ever paid in Charleston for a house. The previous record holder had been the William Gibbes House at 64 South Battery which had sold for $6.1 million in January 2006. The O'Donnell House retained that distinction until the sale of 37 Meeting St. in May 2009 for $7.37 million.

As pioneers, from Wisconsin by way of Colorado, they crossed the Raton Pass in a covered wagon and establish a new home in New Mexico. Manly Chase purchased the land from Lucien Maxwell, part of the Maxwell Land Grant. The ranch is near the Ponil Creek, a mile north of the Cimarron River, not far from the Santa Fe Trail.cimarronnm.com, Cimarron Area Ranches and the Maxwell Wildlife Refuge The Ranch included the old Kit Carson homestead. Before pioneers the land was near by was populated by Apaches and Ute people. Manly helped make the local Native Americans good neighbors, he provided them with beef. Map of the Chase RanchSouthWestFarmPress.com, Chase Ranch, Cow Girl, Oct 30, 2013 Manly Chase (b. 1842) started with a sheep ranch. By 1875, he started raising cattle with Texas Longhorns and Corriente cattle. Hereford cattle were introduced onto the ranch in 1883. Manly also planted an apple orchard that continues today. Manly and Theresa Chase raised six children in their 14-room ranch house. The Chase Ranch is famous for its heart-shaped brand and allegedly the Marlboro Man's place of origin. There is a much known about the Chase family as Manly Chase wrote more than 70 books of records, including several daily diaries that are now in the New Mexico State University Library. The Chase Ranch remained a family-owned ranch run by Chase descendants. This ended in August 2012, when Manly and Theresa's great-granddaughter Gretchen Sammis died. After Gretchen‚Äôs death, ownership of the ranch changed to the Chase Ranch Foundation. Gretchen had created the foundation to preserve the 11,000-acre ranch and her family‚Äôs heritage. Gretchen Sammis owned and operated the ranch for 58 years. Long before her death in August 2012, she had drafted the Chase Ranch Foundation paperwork. She wanted the Chase Ranch to educate young people in ranching. She was secretary of the Cimarron School Board, a member of the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame and 2007 New Mexico Cattleman of the year.

He is known for ', a Polish language play. Karen Majewski wrote, in Traitors and True Poles, that Chrostowski is an exemplar of an alternative Polish collective identity based on social class in preference to ethnic group or nationality.  Biography  Chrostowski was born in Russian Poland of a noble Polish Family. He was a self-proclaimed active member of the Russian Nihilist movement. He was educated in Moscow, where he was involved in revolutionary circles and joined the Black Hand Society. He was wounded in an attack on a government newspaper office which resulted in his expulsion under a police guard. He was sent back home by the government. He escaped or emigrated to the United States before 1887. He was a member of Ognisko, a New York group of immigrant radical leftist journalists and social activists. \\"While he played a role in the establishment of Immaculate Heart of Mary Church,\\" Charles Kaczynski wrote, in Polish American Studies, that \\"Chrostowski became a pivotal character in the establishment of the American Catholic Church.\\" In 1894, a national convention of seceding Polish Roman Catholics, according to The New York Times, organized \\"a new church society, under the adopted name of American Catholic Church\\" in which \\"the separate churches comprising the society are to control and possess their own property\\" and feature \\"free seats and parochial schools\\". During the convention, Archbishop Joseph Ren√© Vilatte \\"was appointed the ecclesiastical head of the new church\\" but he was \\"to be without arbitrary powers\\" and subordinate bishops would be elected. Chrostowski proposed a motion \\"that all allegiance to the Pope of Rome be renounced, but after a warm discussion this motion was not carried.\\" After announcing plans to hold its second convention, according to Kaczynski, \\"the American Catholic Church seemingly disappeared from the historical record.\\" Majewski wrote that \\"all traces of him seem to disappear within Polonia by early 1900s\\"; except, in 1915, he was arrested \\"on a warrant charging him with being deranged\\" based on letters he wrote to President Woodrow Wilson and his Cabinet and was held for observation at Bellevue Hospital Center, and according to Majewski, he is listed in 1920 United States Census as a 48-year-old playwright.

Hebb of McGill University and N.W. Morton that assists in testing visual intelligence as well as understanding human behavior. The test includes a series of pictures that each show a typical situation but have something out of place in the photo and provides evidence that supports the idea that the right temporal lobe is involved in visual recognition. When patients with lesions to the right temporal lobe were given the MPAT, they were unable to point to the absurdity in the photo and perceived that nothing was out of place. The test is used to measure a cultural comprehension which allows for a basis to then estimate an individual's intelligence. However, this test alone is not enough to accurately give a single score or representation of a person's overall intelligence. The MPAT is not meant to be used across a variety of populations due to the fact that the social norms of varied populations can be tremendously different, causing the results of the test to be indeterminate. Background The McGill Picture Anomaly test was created in 1937 by Donald O. Hebb and N.W. Morton, a member of the McGill Psychology Department. Hebb applied for a job with Wilder Penfield, the founder of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) where he, once hired, would study the psychological effects of brain operations. His research included observing the different cognitive impairments that resulted from lesions of various areas of the brain. He also conducted similar experiments in rats. After reviewing his observations, Hebb wanted to look for specific aspects of intelligence that were affected by a brain lesion. He wanted to look at these specific changes instead of attempting to measure an overall intellectual change. In Hebb's looking into specific aspects of intelligence affected by a brain lesion, he was led to the creation of both the verbal Comprehension Test as well as the non-verbal Picture Anomaly Test which he developed alongside N.W. Morton. Right Temporal Lobe The temporal lobes are very important in the visual system as well as in the production and comprehension of language. The left temporal lobe contains Wernicke's area and Broca's area, which are both important in the production and comprehension of language. The right temporal lobe is a part of the ventral stream in the visual pathway. The ventral stream is involved in object perception and visual recognition such as faces and objects, and is therefore often referred to in relation to the McGill Picture Anomaly test. The ventral stream is often referred to as the \\"what\\" stream and provides a portrayal of the objects in the receptive field that ultimately aids in identifying the importance of the object. The different functions of each lobe account for the \\"disturbance of non-language capacities\\" experienced after the removal of the right temporal lobe. If the ventral stream is disturbed or altered, the subject will not lose his vision but the ability to recognize \\"what\\" the object is in his receptive field. Disturbances in the ventral stream can be caused by damage or deterioration to any part of the brain involved in the ventral stream including the right temporal lobe. Conducting the test The McGill Picture Anomaly Test is a non-verbal test and requires the subject to simply point out the aspect of the photo or drawing that is out of place. When conducting the test, Hebb and Morton made it clear that the experimenter should use very little verbal instructions in order to eliminate the possibly of influencing the subject. Any remarks made by the participant during testing are ignored and do not contribute to the participant's overall score because the test is purely visual. Each series of the MPAT consists of 34 pictures each with an absurdity that is obvious to subjects with intact and normal functioning right temporal lobes but is more difficult for subjects with lesions or injuries of the right temporal lobe to recognize . An example of the pictures that may be included in the test is if the picture had a group of people dressed in nice evening wear but one person is wearing a hula girl outfit. In this picture, the absurdity would clearly be the hula girl. Donald O. Hebb and N.W. Norton combined the MPAT with the verbal situation series to create the McGill Adult Comprehension Examination which is used to measure adult intelligence. Hebb and Norton intended for the MPAT to be used alone with the idea that it would aid in diagnostic tests; they also created the test with the intention that the test could be used for other experiments trying to measuring intelligence. The test is often used in experiments involving patients diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy because of the damage in their temporal lobe(s). It has also been shown in a study that the recognition of picture absurdities, such as those shown in the MPAT, was significantly lower in a group of patients with dementia of Alzheimer type. The dementia of Alzheimer type patients' results were compared to the results of patients with dementia syndrome of depression and cerebrovascular dementia. This impairment can be attributed to the reduced cognition and judgement utilizing visual data. Experiments The McGill Picture Anomaly Test has been used in studies trying to measure intelligence and in studies trying to use it as a component of diagnosis. Experiments that used the MPAT for diagnostic value have shown no significant results that support any diagnostic value to the test. The potential diagnostic value of the MPAT would be in visual perception. The MPAT has been used in diagnosing patients with visual-constructive disabilities, and if they receive a normal score on the test, then they are not considered to have any difficulties with picture- interpretation tasks. An experiment conducted by William Sloan and Barbara Oblinger at Lincoln State School and Colony attempted to see if there were diagnostic values of Picture Anomaly tests and Verbal Absurdity tests in mental institution evaluations of patients. Sloan and Oblinger found that the Verbal Absurdity tests had some significant findings but there were no significant findings when using the MPAT. Sloan and Oblinger believe that the sample size may have affected the findings for the MPAT but have not conducted a follow up experiment testing that hypothesis. Another experiment conducted by Denis Shalman attempted to see if the McGill Picture Anomaly Test has a diagnostic value with temporal lobe epilepsy. Shalman used patients with right temporal lobe epileptic episodes and patients with left temporal lobe epileptic episodes; Shalman hoped to replicate Brenda Milner's results which used the MPAT on patients with a temporal lobe lobectomy which found that certain dysfunctions in patients with disturbances of the right temporal lobe affected visual recognition. Milner found that when the right temporal lobe was removed from a patient, pictures and representational drawings became unclear and lost their distinctiveness to the patient. Shalman's findings did not support Milner's findings and showed that the McGill Picture Anomaly Test does not have the diagnostic value that Milner had previously claimed. Although the McGill Picture Anomaly Test has had little diagnostic value, the test is still a common test that experimenters use to determine if there are any problems with visual recognition and interpretation or the right temporal lobe.

He is a member of the Republican Party. Pantelides was elected in November 2013, defeating incumbent Josh Cohen.Republican Mike Pantelides wins Annapolis mayoral election Baltimore News Journal Pantelides was 30 years old at the time of his election and was the city's first Republican mayor in more than a decade. Early life and education Pantelides was born in Annapolis, Maryland on September 5, 1983 to parents John and Gloria Pantelides. He attended Archbishop Spalding High School in Severn. In 2007, he earned B.A. degree in philosophy from West Virginia University where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity. A third generation Annapolitan, Mike's grandparents arrived in Annapolis from Greece and Cyprus in the 1940s and opened The Royal Restaurant in the heart of the city's historic district. Pantelides' first political experience came when he was 3, during his father's congressional campaign in 1986. Career After graduating from college, Pantelides moved back to Annapolis. He served as an at-large member of the Annapolis Republican Central Committee and was president of the Germantown- Homewood Civic Association. He managed the campaign for Republican David Cordle, who in 2009 lost to Josh Cohen in the race for mayor. Pantelides also served as campaign manager for Jerry Cave when Cave ran for the state Senate in 2010. Before being elected mayor, Pantelides sold government relations software (2012-2013) at Vocus, a Beltsville-based cloud marketing software firm. Prior to that position he sold advertising for The Capital newspaper in Annapolis, and The Baltimore Sun, for less than a year each. He also worked for his father, John Pantelides, as a land development consultant. Pantelides is an Eagle Scout, and said during the campaign that he has been a volunteer with the Annapolis Jaycees, Habitat for Humanity, and 21st Century Education Foundation. In November 2013, Pantelides was elected Mayor of Annapolis, becoming the city's first Republican mayor since 1997. At the time, he credited his campaign's success to his volunteers. During the campaign, Pantelides ran on a \\"Sweep Annapolis Clean\\" platform, creating a crusade to change policy and processes in the city. During his first 100 days in office, he reorganized departments and created initiatives in an attempt to support business and economic development in the city. He worked with the city council to pass the city's 2015 budget, which succeeded by an eight to one vote. He also dealt with several resignations from city leaders in the early months of this term. Mayor Pantelides set his own standard for the transition process in his administration. Pantelides opened up the application process for his transition team to the public. More than 200 citizens applied, and he appointed Democrats, Republicans, and Greens in an effort to be bipartisan. Pantelides wanted an inclusive approach for citizen involvement. One way the Mayor's office is making it possible to communicate with populations that, in the past, were difficult to reach, is the Language Bank. Made up of 61 residents that speak 23 different languages, they offer their talents to the city, helping individuals to communicate through their translation services. Pantelides also brought on a Hispanic liaison to work with local faith based groups and the growing Hispanic community. But even with this effort, the mayor faced early criticism for a lack of diversity in city government. Pantelides established an open door policy, and on the first Tuesday of each month citizens could come into his office and discuss concerns, offer advice, or ask questions related to Annapolis. In March 2014, Pantelides came under fire for passing a profane note to an Annapolis City Alderman during a City Council meeting. Pantelides also faced criticism when it was revealed that the acting city attorney met with the mayor's cousin in an Annapolis police station after the cousin was arrested for attempted murder. Pantelides is an ex officio member of the National Sailing Hall of Fame, is a board member on the Annapolis and Anne Arundel County Visitors Bureau and sits on the Legislative Committee for the Maryland Municipal League. In 2014, Pantelides endorsed Republican Anne Arundel County executive candidate Steve Schuh in the general election. In 2017, Pantelides lost re-election to Democrat Gavin Buckley.

It was released on July 3, 2014, for the Wii U on the Nintendo eShop. A Windows port was later released on July 3, 2020.  Gameplay  Armillo is an action platform game in which the playable character, an armadillo named Armillo, rolls around a 3D space. He can perform three primary actions: roll, jump, and boost. The game is designed around the concept of an obstacle course, so the player is constantly being presented to various new puzzles, mechanics, and challenges. Gameplay has been likened to other games such as the Sonic the Hedgehog series, Super Mario Galaxy, and the Super Monkey Ball series. Players primarily progress through levels by rolling Armillo and have the option to utilize the tilt controls of the Wii U's GamePad to do so. Armillo is aided in his quest through special abilities and power-ups such as a size boost and the Critter gun which fires the non-playable Critters at Armillo's enemies. While the majority of the game takes place in a 3D world, there are unlockable 2D bonus stages in every single non-boss level. Purchasable upgrades, obtained using blue orbs collected in levels, also enable optional backtracking of previously completed levels.  Development  Armillo was developed by Fuzzy Wuzzy Games for the Wii U and is distributed on the Nintendo eShop. The game will be a timed exclusive on the platform, as it is scheduled to be released on other platforms in the future. The decision was made in honor of Nintendo's recent support for independent developers.  Reception  Armillo received mixed reviews since its release. It holds an aggregate score of 79% at GameRankings and 72 at Metacritic, the latter of which indicates mixed or average reviews.

They see the emperor's massive army, his intense cruelty, and the devastating magic that keeps his power in place. It's not till they leave that they discover he's about to launch a major invasion of Gyongxe. The mountain land is home to many temples... including the First Temple of the Living Circle, which Rosethorn has vowed to defend. With time running out, the mages race to warn their Gyongxin friends of the emperor's plans. Duty, mystery, magic, and terror will drive them apart on the way. And while new friends will do their best to bring the mages together again on the field of battle, deadly enemies hide in every mountain pass, just waiting to destroy them.

His research goal was to \\"...discover the social location of the innovators of linguistic change and therefore focuses on the embedding of individuals in their neighborhood.\\" Ash, Sharon. \\"Social Class.\\"\\" The Handbook of Language Variation and Change, 402-422. Malden, Mass: Blackwell.Labov, William. Principles of Linguistic Change, vol iii: Social Factors. Malden and Oxford: Blackwell. 2001. Methods To test his hypothesis, Labov identified socially and ethnically central groups by gathering information on five Philadelphia neighborhoods through census data and initial surveys. He selected particular blocks in each neighborhood as an initial research point using a specific set of criteria including full occupancy of dwellings, high levels of interaction between people, and public spaces where interaction can occur. The field workers presented their research goals to the residents broadly and ‚Äúwithout singling out language for specific attention‚Äù in the sociolinguistic interviews. The goals of these interviews were to gather social data on the residents, their block, and the neighborhood and analyze linguistic variants without facing the problem of the Observer's paradox. That is, the field workers attempted to create an environment where the speaker would speak informally. To gauge each speaker‚Äôs social position within the community, Labov created a socioeconomic status index based on education and occupation, each ranked on levels from 0 to 6, where 6 was the highest level of education or occupation. He studied a series of ‚Äúnew and vigorous‚Äù vowel changes, including the fronting and raising of (aw) and (ey) and the centralization of (ey). He also studied the nearly completed changes involving (ow) and (aeh) and incipient changes such as the lowering of (e) and (ae).Labov, William. 1984 ‚ÄúField methods of the Project on Linguistic Change and Variation.‚Äù Language in Use. 43-70. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall. 1984. Results Graph of the curvilinear principle, showing that the frequency of use is highest in the interior classes and lowest in the exterior classes. Labov discovered that incipient changes did not provide a strong correlation with age or social class because these variants were too early in their stages of development to display any social significance. The nearly completed and most advanced changes displayed the most stability within the study and showed intermediate correlation with the middle classes. The new and vigorous changes‚Äîthe focal point of the study‚Äîdisplayed the strongest curvilinearity and most clearly encompassed the linguistically innovative nature of the inner classes. Through these Results, Labov asserted the truth and significance of what he named the Curvilinear Principle. With the social information gathered from the interviews, he discovered that it is not the education or occupation factors that drove the middle class to spur linguistic change. Rather, it was the central location within their communities‚Äîboth socially and literally. They were not only central in the social hierarchy, but also in their local environments and interactions. Other Factors Labov considered age as a factor in his research along with social class, occupation, and education. He discovered in the majority of vowel variables, adolescents aged 13‚Äì16 had the highest values of use of innovative forms. To eliminate bias and errors due to other social factors such as age, Labov created the Philadelphia Telephone Study to corroborate the curvilinear hypothesis. Philadelphia Telephone Study The telephone study was designed as a means to cancel out any possible errors that may have occurred in the neighborhood study, including but not limited to errors in selecting neighborhood representatives, errors in choosing neighborhoods to represent Philadelphia class distribution, and errors involving the physical research equipment. The telephone survey was done through random sampling of Philadelphia phone numbers, and therefore eliminated the biases that occur with selection of neighborhoods and interviewees. Due to the nature of telephone interviews, there was a possibility of error from the quality of sound, but this error was not present in the neighborhood study. The findings of the telephone study were closely related to the findings of the neighborhood study, strengthening the curvilinear hypothesis and leading Labov to the creation of the principle.

His father was an officer at the Imperial Russian Army. After the 1917 October Revolution Gr√∂nhagen family fled to the Finnish town of Viipuri. He graduated from University of Helsinki and studied later at the University of Sorbonne in Paris. In 1935 the German newspaper Frankfurter Volksblatt published Gr√∂nhagen's article on Kalevala folklore. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler showed interest on his thoughts and asked Gr√∂nhagen to work for Ahnenerbe. He led a 1936 Finnish-German voyage through Karelia. This expedition mostly recorded pagan sorcerers and witches. In 1937 and 1938 Gr√∂nhagen made two more voyages to Karelia, alone this time. He also worked shortly as one of the institute's directors but was dismissed by professor Walter W√ºst who considered Gr√∂nhagen incompetent. During World War II, the Nazi-minded Gr√∂nhagen worked for Finland's propaganda department and served as its military attach√© in Berlin. He was arrested in Oslo 1945 and held in custody for two years. After his release Gr√∂nhagen was a businessman and emigrated to Greece in 1964.

Plot When Wong Chi-sing (Louis Koo) was training in the police academy, he achieved prominent grades which prompts Superintendent Ko (Joe Lee) to send him undercover before his graduation. After five years, Chi-sing finally gains the trust of Hung Hing Gang's most prominent leader Lung Yat-fei, known as Fei-lung Gor (Andy Lau). One time, Fei-lung's sworn brother Tong Pau (Anthony Wong) was fighting for territories with another triad boss Loan Shark Ko (Steve Lee), which happened on the day of Fei-lung's mother's (Paw Hee-ching) birthday party. Unknown to Pau, the police have planted undercover cop Big Head Man (Eric Wan) in his gang for many years. On that night, Pau was arrested and hospitalized due to heavy injuries. Since Pau is seriously injured, the Hung Hing Gang forces Fei- lung, who has been dealing with legal business for the past five years, back to the underworld, to which Fei-lung refuses. Pau's son Man-chun (Patrick Tam), a ruthless man, takes the opportunity for vengeance and makes a deal with the elders that whoever is able to find the mole and kill Superintendent Ko and Loan Shark Ko, will get the opportunity to be the new leader. When Chi- sing hears of this, he decides to immediately inform Big Head Man. Since Man lost his pager, Chi-sing was unable to call him and tries to find Man in his son's school. When Chi-sing makes it there, Man has left with his son and while trying to find him everywhere, he finds Man and his son killed by Man- chun and his henchmen. Man-chun is actually desperate to take his father's position as Hung Hing's leader and pretends to feel sad for his father and tells Chi-sing to kill Superintendent Ko, which Chi-sing neglects. Fei-lung does not want to deal with the underworld and tells Chi-sing to beware of moles around him, which makes Chi-sing feel guilty. Man-chun calls Chi-sing to negotiate with Loan Shark Man, while on the other hand orders his henchmen to sweep Ko's business and rape his wife and daughter. While Ko was negotiating with Chi-sing, he finds out that his business were all swept and his wife and daughter raped and decides to kill Chi-sing before he was rescued by Fei-lung, which makes Ko believe that Fei-lung is behind all this and decides to take revenge on him. Later, Superintendent Ko tells Chi-sing to immediately assist in arresting Fei-ung, but Chi-sing explains to Ko that Man-chun is the mastermind behind this and persuades him to arrest Man-chun instead, which leads Ko to misunderstand that Chi-sing has renegaded and detains him. When Chi-sing's girlfriend Judy (Joey Meng) learns that Man-chun sent his top henchmen Ma Wong (Frankie Ng) and Fa Fit (Lung Fong) to kidnap Fei-ung's wife Daisy (Suki Kwan), Judy immediately informs Daisy; while on the other hand, Loan Shark Ko has captured Fei-lung's mother to threaten Fei-lung to surrender and Man-chun unexpectedly arrives and kills Ko while trapping Fei-lung, his mother and son in a farm. When Superintendent Ko finds Loan Shark Ko dead in Fei-lung's house, he lists Fei-lung as a wanted criminal. When Chi-sing rescues Daisy, he learns that Man-chun has captured Fei-lung and his family and goes to find Man-chun in his company. While also with the help of Chi- sing, Daisy was able to avoid being rapped by Man-chun and holds him hostage to the farm to rescue Fei-lung, his mother and son. However, after rescuing Fei-lung where a major gunfight occurs, Daisy was killed by Man-chun in the process. In the end, Fei-lung decides to take revenge. When Chi-sing learns of this, he immediately rushes to stop him from this mistake. There, Fei-lung uses Chi-sing's gun to resolve Man-chun. Chi-sing shoots Man-chun for self- defense where Man-chun also falls off the building and dies.

Capacity building for indigenous peoples to engage with United Nations processes and natural resource management, including promoting traditional knowledge, has supported increasing participation. Representatives said IIFPCC proposals were mostly ignored at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference that resulted in the Canc√∫n Agreement, in which the need for safeguards for local communities in REDD+ was documented in Annex 1. Indigenous representatives developed the Oaxaca Action Plan of Indigenous Peoples: From Canc√∫n to Durban and Beyond, a plan for indigenous peoples‚Äô advocacy and lobbying from COP17 through to the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples at UN Headquarters in 2014. The plan aimed to address the lack of implementation of elements of the Canc√∫n Agreement about indigenous peoples‚Äô human rights and their participation in making climate change policies. The IIFPCC has asked the SBSTA for more effective participation of indigenous peoples and respect for indigenous traditional knowledge in REDD+ monitoring systems. It has articulated links between climate change mitigation and adaptation projects and human rights. It has called for the Green Climate Fund to be more transparent and for greater financial support of indigenous peoples' natural resource management, monitoring and participation in governance. A new global UNFCC initiative is underway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions released during deforestation, due to a concern that current regulations restrict the ability of native people to regulate the forests that are on their own land. The initiative is called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Developing Countries. The UNFCC hopes that this initiative may lead to billions of dollars of annual payment for carbon emissions avoided by conservation efforts.

Lengson is best known for his involvement in the Tooth & Nail/SolidState metal band, MyChildren MyBride and is currently performing under the moniker The Woodsman's Babe.  Early life  Lengson was born in Los Angeles, California and raised in Bullhead City, Arizona. He began playing piano at age seven and had participated in many local musical projects growing up ranging from early American folk to death metal. Lengson wasn't brought up in a spiritual household, however found faith at the age of seventeen on his own after extensive research and questioning. Before Lengson discovered he could be a musician, Lengson wanted to be a medical doctor.  Musical life  Lengson's first solo record was released in 2004 under the name Red Lights & Semis, which was an instrumental ambient electronic project that stemmed off the aspiration to create film score soundtrack music. \\"Red Lights & Semis One\\" garnered attention from musical published agencies and utilized the track \\"Magnum\\" over a Biological Education Series on Discovery Channel in 2006. Lengson released Red Lights and Semis Two in 2005, and Red Lights and Semis Three in 2007. In 2006 Lengson and friends started the hardcore band \\"XBraveheartX\\", where Lengson sat in as the drummer. In 2008, XBraveheartX signed to 1981 Records that released the band's debut album Speak To These Bones. In 2007, Lengson's former high school bandmate, Robert Bloomfield, asked Lengson to join Mychildren Mybride to be a full-time bassist when they signed to the record label Tooth & Nail Records / Solid State Records. At the time Lengson was studying medical at Northern Arizona University. Lengson joined in September 2007 and was a part of Mychildren Mybride. The band released the 2008 debut record Unbreakable, (Joey Sturgis, Adam Dutkiewicz) the 2010 album Lost Boy, (Matt Goldman, Jason Seucof,) which landed on the Billboard 200 and the 2012 self-titled album, Mychildren Mybride, (Zeuss.)  Solo works  In the fall of 2010, Lengson was offered a position hosting a MTVu television show counting down the top music videos, after winning a contest hosted by Mountain Dew, but declined the offer to continue to tour. In May 2011, Lengson's book, Sleeping in Parking Lots, a 30-chapter memoir of tour stories and personal life lessons, was published worldwide. In 2012 Lengson left MyChildren MyBride and moved back to Los Angeles to focus on a new solo musical project, The Woodsman's Babe. Lengson played his last show with Mychildren Mybride at the House of Blues in Anaheim, CA. In 2013, Lengson had his second literary work \\"Too Many States Get in the Way\\" published by Autumn + Colour. The book's subtitle is \\"Poems About Love & Loss\\" and is of poetry and lyricism that Lengson wrote while transitioning from Mychildren Mybride to The Woodsman's Babe.  The Woodsman's Babe  In February 2012, nine months after announcing his departure with MyChildren MyBride, Lengson premiered The Woodsman's Babe via Alternative Press along with first single Red or White. Lengson on the name of the project, \\"It was the title of an old book that I found in a used book store. I found the name to be masculine and sexy at the same time. None of my friends liked the name, they didn't really get it, that's probably why I chose it. I didn't put too much thought into it, the name was really the least important element to the whole project to me.\\" In May 2013, the music video of Red or White premiered on MTV on the program AMTV, where MTV noted Lengson a MTV Buzzworthy artist and quoted Lengson to be \\"all over the darn place.\\" In August 2013, The Woodsman's Babe signed with the independent record label Autumn + Colour, where he released the self-titled EP . In February 2015, The Woodsman's Babe signed with CI Records, where the debut full-length album is to be released. On April 15, 2016, The Woodsman's Babe released the second album under CI Records, \\"BABELAND\\" which was produced by Stephen Keech. In an interview for Urban Outfitters, Lengson states he was \\"drinking a lot and sleeping a lot\\" in the month that he wrote Babeland.

During his residency in Verona, he is alleged to have accomplished a number of feats, including composing or copying a large volume of texts, founding or helping to found several institutions in and around Verona, as well as several inventions that have been attributed to him. His works have been referenced and idealized by many inhabitants of Verona throughout history, and his charters were frequently used as evidence in debates surrounding the authority of the bishops and archdeacons of the city. He was reportedly well educated on a variety of subjects and has been held up by some as an example of a Carolingian Uomo Universale. There is a street named after him in Verona. Sources Not much can be determined about Pacificus from contemporary documents, as few survive from his time. His existence is proved by at least one private document bearing his autograph signature from 809,Pacificus, Fondo Veneto, I, no. 6529. 13 May 809. Verona.

These documents relate to the properties held by the schola sacerdotum (a school for priests) he is credited with founding in Verona. There are several other charters or documents claimed to have been written or signed by Pacificus, but their authenticity is currently a matter of debate.Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed.

Other sources providing details from Pacificus' life include the fourteenth-century work Historiae Imperialis (Imperial History) by Giovanni de Matociis (commonly known as Giovanni Mansionario), and the 16th- century work Antiquitates Veronenses by the Augustinian monk Onuphrius Panvinius. Life=Early Life and Career Little is known about Pacificus' early life. He was supposedly descended from noble stock, and was educated at the Abbey of Reichenau,Maureen C Miller, The Formation of a Medieval Church: Ecclesiastical Change in Verona, 950-1150, (New York: Cornell University Press, 1993), 124. known for it clerical school which produced clerks for many Imperial and ducal chanceries during the Carolingian period. When he returned to Verona he took charge of the Veronese cathedral chapter's school and scriptorium. One of the few known events from his early life, when Pacificus was a deacon in Verona. The earliest account of this event comes from Panvinius' Antiquates Veronenses. In 798 Charlemagne decided to rebuild the city walls to protect the city against the threat of the Avar Khaganate. The cost of rebuilding the walls led to disputes between the clerical and civic authorities of the city over the burden of payment. The citizens demanded that the clergy pay one third of the cost, while the clergy insisted that they only need pay one quarter, as was customary. Without proof to support either side, it was decided to subject a representative of both sides to an ordeal by cross, and Pacificus was chosen to represent the clergy. Both parties stood against a cross holding their arms out while the Passion according to Matthew was read aloud. Pacificus held his arms upright through the entire reading while his opponent lowered his, leading the judge to rule that God favored Pacificus' side. Pacificus' victory was considered proof of an established custom afterwards, such as when Lothair planned to restore the city walls, and the clergy of Verona only had to pay one quarter of the costs of restorations of the walls.Onuphrius Panvinius, Antiquitates Veronenses, (Patavii: 1648), cited in Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed.

Yitzhak Hen and Matthew Innes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 262-264. Archdeacon of Verona Pacificus was promoted to the position of archdeacon of Verona most likely in 803, thought issues have been raised with this date. After this, there are two mutually exclusive accounts of his life, around which there is some debate. The long accepted version paints Pacificus as a pious, model clergyman, who was a staunch defender of his bishop Ratoldus, even going so far as to administer the diocese during Ratoldus' absence from 834-840, until his death in 844.Maureen C Miller, The Formation of a Medieval Church: Ecclesiastical Change in Verona, 950-1150, (New York: Cornell University Press, 1993), 124. As archdeacon, Pacificus was known for his active role in administering and establishing institutions in the city. He was reportedly the founder of the city's schola sacerdotum at the beginning of the ninth century, which he later made directly subject to the Patriarch of Aquileia. He is described as participating in writing a document from June 813 with Bishop Ratoldus which grants the schola an independent income, and later arguing that the schola was independent from the authority of the bishop. He also is credited with donating the land upon which the schola's church was built, which was used as an argument that it remained outside the authority of the bishop.Pacificus, II-I-Ir. 24 June 813.

In the church's Veronese archives there are marginalia and notes attributed to Pacificus on texts such as the Sapiential Books, Psalms, and the Rule of St Benedict. He also was responsible for copying and restoring a number of other texts in the chapter's possession, and notes and corrections believed to be in Pacificus' hand are found on copies of texts by St Augustine, Pope Gregory the Great, Sulpicius Severus and St Jerome.\\"Codices Latini Antiquiores: a paleographical guide to latin manuscripts prior to the ninth century,\\" Italy: Perugia-Verona, Vol. 4, ed.

He is also credited with the invention of several devices, including a means to throw flames from ships,G. B. C.

Abbot, Abbot's American Watchmaker: An Encyclopedia for the Horologist, Jeweler, Gold and Silversmith, (Skyhorse Publishing, 2012). In medieval texts and illustrations however, it is shown that his \\"clock\\" was in fact an observation tube with crosshairs, accompanied by an argumentum, a text containing instructions on how to interpret the observations, and it was intended to be used not just so that monks could determine the hour of night, but also for calendrical purposes.St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod.

The first of such medieval descriptions is the same poem by Pacificus, published as rhythmus 116 by K. Strecker in M.G.H. \\"Poetae\\" IV/2, and followed by rhythmus 117, \\"Carmen sperae caeli\\", a praise of the Christian zodiac, signed by the author himself with the same formula (Hirenicus humilis levita) found in the ms. Paris 1924 in a folio written, according to Campana, by Pacificus himself. Another poetical text on computus, rhythmus \\"Anni domini notantur\\", has been also attributed to Pacificus.Robertini 1996. Doubts and Criticisms The life and accomplishments of Pacificus of Verona has recently come under fire, most prominently by the Italian medievalist Cristina La Rocca. La Rocca makes an argument that much of what is attributed to Pacificus is in fact a fabrication constructed by later medieval writers to support their own arguments.Cristina La Rocca, Pacifico di Verona. Il Passato Carolingio Nella Costruzione Della Memoria Urbana, (Nella Sede Dell'Istituto, 1995), cited in Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed. Yitzhak Hen and Matthew Innes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000).Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed. Yitzhak Hen and Matthew Innes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). La Rocca argues that Pacificus, while still real and holding the position of archdeacon of Verona for some time, was not the illustrious, well-educated and charitable author, inventor and architect he is purported to be. La Rocca notes that Pacificus, along with the rest of the cathedral chapter, likely sided with King Bernard of Italy during his rebellion against his uncle, Emperor Louis the Pious, of whom the Veronese Bishop Ratoldus was a staunch supporter. According to La Rocca, this rivalry between Pacificus the Archdeacon and Ratoldus the Bishop likely ended with Pacificus' banishment following the failure of Bernard's rebellion, a fact supported by the fact that a monk named Pacificus (a relatively rare name) appears in the records of the Abbey of Nonantola in 826. If Pacificus was banished, it is likely that he remained in Nonantola until his death.Mayke de Jong, \\"Book Reviews. Pacifico di Verona.

La Rocca's arguments hinge upon the fact that there are few documents about Pacificus that can be proven to have been written from his lifetime. She admits the two documents relating to the establishment of the schola as legitimate, and little else. The epitaphs in the Verona cathedral, which had long been thought contemporaneous to Pacificus, she argues in fact date from the construction of the cathedral in the twelfth century. She argues that it was during the tenure of Theobald as archdeacon of Verona (1120-1135), who was the first bishop to be appointed from the ranks of the cathedral chapter (1135-1157), that Pacificus' name first appeared in reference to many documents related to the cathedral chapter's history and the founding of the schola and xenodochium. She argues that these documents were created to strengthen the chapter's claims to a number of churches and other properties in Verona, by constructing the story around Pacificus to illustrate the chapter's Carolingian roots and traditions in an attempt to support its claims of autonomy from the bishop of Verona and protect the chapter from the reforms within the church at the time. One of the items constructed during this period, according to La Rocca, is the epitaphs, or at least the first one, which were mounted in the Verona Cathedral, where they were publicly visible, to support their claims surrounding Pacificus and have him serve as a model of the duties of an archdeacon.Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed.

She argues that it is based on this epitaph that much of the later work written about Pacificus is based upon, with later additions to his story being similarly constructed to serve the purposes of the present by moving the argument into the past, such as Panvinius' account of the trial surrounding the payment for the reconstruction of the city's walls being fabricated to underscore an argument the clergy of Verona were having at the time with the Venetian Republic's tax assessment of the church.Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed. Yitzhak Hen and Matthew Innes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 262-266. La Rocca was not the first to raise issues regarding the epitaphs, however, as there was much debate in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries over their provenance. Issues were raised regarding the date of their construction, their original location within the cathedral as well as that of Pacificus' tomb, and surrounding the dates mentioned for when Pacificus served as archdeacon. It was noted that the two epitaphs contained conflicting dates as to his death, and that the years listed for Pacificus archdeaconship conflicted with established facts regarding the dates during which Lothair was King of Italy, the fact that the first epitaph specifically names the day (Sunday) and month in which he died despite the fact that the day he supposedly died did not fall on a Sunday in the year mentioned, as well as the existence of separate documents listing different archdeacons in Verona during the years he was supposedly in office, Tisus in 806 and Audo in 845.Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed. Yitzhak Hen and Matthew Innes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 266-272. The documents used to justify the chapter's exemptions were also challenged prior to La Rocca, and were eventually declared to be forgeries by an investigation instigated by Benedict XIV in 1756.O. Viviani, \\"La fine delle controversie per l'ensenzione giurisdizionale del capitolo veronese\\", Atti e memorie dell'Accademia di agricoltura, scienze e lettere di Verona 6a s, 5 (Verona, 1995), cited in Cristina La Rocca, \\"A man for all seasons: Pacificus of Verona and the creation of a local Carolingian past,\\" chap. 11 in The Uses of the Past in the Early Middle Ages, ed. Yitzhak Hen and Matthew Innes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). While La Rocca has raised a number of questions about the veracity of the claims surrounding Pacificus of Verona, her arguments are not entirely accepted among medieval scholars. Some scholars accept the conclusions she has reached, such as Nicholas Everett, who in his 2003 book Literacy in Lombard Italy describes \\"... the more famous examples of marginalia attributed to Bishop Pacificus [sic] and his schola sacerdotum, both of which appear to belong more to the realm of myth than history.\\"Nicholas Everett, Literacy in Lombard Italy, c. 568-774, (Cambridge: Cambridge Press, 2003), 287. However there are also those who do not accept her version of Pacificus' history, such as the late Donald A. Bullough, who in his 2004 book Alcuin, Achievement and Reputation, stated \\"The elaborate attempt by C. La Rocca ... to impugn the authenticity of the epitaphs and their evidence for Pacificus' life and career has not persuaded me or others.\\" Specialists of Carolingian poetry, such as Gabriel Silagi, Gian Paolo Marchi, Grazia Di Pasquale, Francesco Stella disputed some aspects of La Rocca's reconstruction and called attention to the poetical, exegetical and epistolary works of Pacificus which have been overlooked in La Rocca's volume.Donald A Bullough, Alcuin, Achievement and Reputation: Being part of the Ford lectures delivered in Oxford in Hilary Term 1980, (Leiden: Koninklijke Brill NV, 2004), 308-309, n180; Di Pasquale 1997, Marchi 2002 e Silagi 1996 NotesReferences * A.

Early life D√ºzdidil Kadƒ±n was born in 1825 in North Caucasus. Born as Ay≈üe Di≈üan, she was a member of Ubykh family, Di≈üan. Her father was ≈ûƒ±hƒ±m Bey Di≈üan and her mother was an Abkhazian princess belonging to Shervashidze. Upon Yahya Bey's decision, Ay≈üe had been brought to Istanbul as a young child, where she entrusted to the imperial harem, along with her nanny Cinan Hanƒ±m, and a maid Emine Hanƒ±m. Here her name according to the custom of the Ottoman court was changed to D√ºzdidil. Marriage D√ºzdidil married Abdulmejid in 1839, and was given the title of \\"Third Consort\\". On 31 May 1840, she gave birth to the Abdulmejid's first child and daughter, Mevhibe Sultan in the Old √áƒ±raƒüan Palace. The princess died on 9 February 1841. On 13 October 1841, she gave birth to twins, Neyyire Sultan and M√ºnire Sultan in the Old Be≈üikta≈ü Palace. The princesses died two years later on 18 December 1843. On 17 August 1843, she gave birth to her fourth child, Cemile Sultan in the Old Beylerbeyi Palace. On 23 February 1845, she gave birth to her fifth child, Samiye Sultan in the Topkapƒ± Palace. The princess died two months later on 18 April 1845. Charles White, who visited Istanbul in 1843, wrote following about her: Death The prayer book of D√ºzdidil that was designed when she fall in the epidemic of tuberculosis D√ºzdidil had fallen victim to the epidemic of tuberculosis then raging in Istanbul. A luxuriously decorated prayer book was commissioned around 1844 for her. As was fitting for her position, the prayer book was lavishly ornate. She died on 18 August 1845, and was buried in the mausoleum of the imperial ladies at the New Mosque Istanbul. Cemile Sultan was only two years old when D√ºzdidil died.

Clark Smith; July 31, 1877 ‚Äì October 8, 1935) was an important African-American musician, composer, and music educator in the United States during the early decades of the 1900s. Born on the Army base at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Smith began his music education very early organizing bands in Wichita starting in 1893. His strict military style leadership led to prominence and over the next 30 years he would lead bands in Chicago, Wichita, Kansas City, the Tuskegee Institute, and in St. Louis. He was an important educator for many of the prominent early Jazz musicians from Kansas City, Chicago, and St. Louis. He died in 1935 as the result of a stroke. Many primary documents about Smith's life have been lost as a result of a fire that destroyed most of his personal documents. Early life Nathaniel Clark Smith was born July 31, 1877 (or possibly in 1866) in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to Dan and Maggie Smith. His father was an Army Trumpeter at the fort. His mother was half Cherokee. At Fort Leavenworth, he learned music under the German bandleader H.E. Gungle who identified Smith's talent and encouraged him to continue his musical education. After finishing formal education, he worked briefly in Kansas City in the publishing industry before beginning service in the Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma as an Army trumpeter in 1891. However, eye problems prevented him from pursuing a military career, so he moved with his wife, Laura Smith (n√©e Lawson), to Wichita, Kansas in 1893. Smith claimed that his father knew Frederick Douglass and that at the age of eight the younger Smith accompanied Douglass in playing the famous Negro spiritual, and song that would become a famous arrangement of Smith's, Steal Away to Jesus. Bandleader Wherever he moved, Smith would organize a variety of different bands and choirs. These included beginner bands, youth touring bands, choral societies, and even symphony orchestras. He began organizing bands in Wichita where one of the bands was selected to attend the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. While in Chicago with the band Smith signed an agreement with Lyon & Healy to work in their music publications division by organizing a number of bands and choruses. For this job, he moved to Chicago where he started a number of bands. In addition, he led the band for the Eighth Illinois Infantry unit for four years. During this time, he went with the infantry unit to the front lines in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War where he met Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Roosevelt at the Battle of San Juan Hill. His military rank and promotion during this period are not precisely clear, however, it is generally contended that during this period he achieved the rank of Major in the United States Army. While living in Chicago he studied at the Chicago Musical College, where he had to register as a \\"private student\\" to attend classes at the otherwise all white school. It was during this time in Chicago that his daughter Anna was born. He returned to Kansas City in 1898 in order to lead a youth band on an 18-month tour of Europe and Australia which would include a performance at the 1900 Paris Exposition. After touring, Smith returned and continued forming and leading bands in Chicago and Wichita until 1905. In that year, Teddy Roosevelt convinced him to become the bandleader at the Tuskegee Institute led by Booker T. Washington. To honor his new institution, he composed the Tuskegee Institute March. After eight years at the Tuskegee Institute, Smith decided to leave because of a rumored disagreement between him and Washington about the number of plantation songs in his orchestral arrangements. Once again, his connection with Teddy Roosevelt, led him to accept a position to head the military and music departments at the Western Baptist University in Kansas City in 1913. His rigorous instruction and strong results led to Smith leaving the university to join the Lincoln High School in Kansas City in 1916. Although his instruction was quite strict, he began encouraging students to experiment with the developing new musical genre of Jazz. He moved again in 1922 to become the bandleader at the Wendell Phillips Academy High School in Chicago. At each place he moved, Smith was noted for organizing many bands in the area including the first African-American symphony orchestra, a number of women's choruses and bands, and youth bands (including the Chicago Defender's Newsboys Band, which included a young Lionel Hampton). In 1931, he moved again to begin teaching at Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri. Although he continued organizing a number of community bands and musical societies, it was in St. Louis that his work achieved the most wide success. His composition Negro Folk Suite won the Wannamaker Prize in 1932 and was performed by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra that same year. During the same period, CBS Radio broadcast a weekly program from 1933 until 1935 titled St. Louis Blues with Smith as the bandleader. Death and legacy Smith returned to Kansas City in 1935. After attending the Joe Louis versus King Levinsky boxing match in Chicago in August 1935 and returning home to Kansas City, he suffered a stroke. He died on October 8, 1935. The University of Missouri-Kansas City page about Smith calls him \\"America's Greatest Colored Bandmaster\\" and his legacy was significant on African-American music and particularly on jazz. He was very rigorous and strict with his musical instruction. One student, Harlan Leonard explained that Smith was \\"short, gruff, military in bearing, wore glasses and was never without his full uniform and decorations. His language was rather rough and occasionally shocking to the few young ladies who were taking music classes, though never offensive.\\" The students he instructed who went on to have significant musical careers include: * Lammar Wright, Sr. * Harlan Leonard * Walter Page * Eddie Cole, brother of Nat King Cole and Ike Cole * Lionel Hampton * Milt Hinton * Ray Nance * Jimmy Forrest * Jessalyn Coleman * Roberta Dodd Crawford * Quinn Wilson * Hayes Alvis * Ernie Wilkins * Pauline James Lee ‚Äì who would become the President of the Chicago University of Music Smith composed almost 100 works and many of these and his other arrangements are notable. Many involved creating musical accompaniment for Negro spirituals and plantation songs. The list of notable compositions include: * Steal Away to Jesus * Frederick Douglass Funeral March * 'Tuskegee Institute March * Negro Folk Suite In addition, he wrote a number of pieces on music practice. This included a weekly column for The Call Newspaper and two books: * The Elements of Music * New Jubilee Songs for Quartette, Choir or Chorus References Category:1877 births Category:1935 deaths Category:American jazz educators Category:African-American jazz composers Category:People from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Category:Musicians from Kansas Category:African-American jazz musicians Category:American bandleaders Category:American people of Cherokee descent ","title":"Nathaniel Clark Smith"},{"id":"41056350","text":"Dom Simon Jubani Dom Simon Jubani (8 March 1927 - 12 July 2011) was a Catholic priest and Albanian political prisoner confined in Burrel Prison for 26 years during the regime of Enver Hoxha.

Life  Kim Min Jeong was born in Incheon, South Korea in 1976. She studied creative writing at Chung-Ang University and also completed master's level coursework there. She began writing for a magazine in her third year of university and later joined Random House Korea as an editor. She edited the Random House series of poetry collections, which served as a springboard for South Korean Futurist poets and made a large impact on the country's poetry scene in the 2000s. As editor of the series, she discovered a number of young poets like Kim Kyung Ju and Hwang Byungsng. She became editor-in-chief at Random House Korea. She made her literary debut in 1999 when Geomeun nanaui kkum (Í≤ÄÏùÄ ÎÇòÎÇòÏùò Íøà Nana's Black Dream) and nine of her other poems won the Munye Joongang Literary Award for Best First Poem. In the 2000s, she became a well-known poet and a leading literary editor. She currently serves as the President of Nanda Books, an imprint of Munhakdongne, and edits Munhakdongne poetry series and novels. Kim won the 8th Park In-Hwan Literary Award and 17th Weolgan Contemporary Poetry Award. She has produced and edited many unconventional works and bestsellers including poetry collections, literary essays, travelogues by writers, and special features. She also teaches university courses.  Writing  Kim's poems criticize the pretentious and male- dominated nature of the South Korean poetry scene. They bluntly expose social injustices using fierce poetic diction and imagination, and have served as a source of inspiration for later poets. Rejecting the dichotomy of \\"good versus evil\\" and \\"truth versus lies,\\" Kim's works capture raw images of our times with intensity and wit. She ridicules the notion that poetry should be serious or mysterious, and has striven to make South Korean poetry more accessible. Themes of her poetry include the hope for a society without violence and hypocrisy.  Works = Poetry collections  1\\\\. „ÄéÎÇ†ÏúºÎäî Í≥†Ïä¥ÎèÑÏπò ÏïÑÍ∞ÄÏî®„Äè(Ïó¥Î¶ºÏõê, 2005) { Flying Miss Hedgehog.

At the time Korea was under Japanese colonial rule. Ha was the eldest son of Ha Jae- jung and Bak Yeon-hak. His primary and secondary education was under the aegis of the Japanese \\"naisen ittai\\" movement, an attempt by the Japanese colonial government to create Japanese citizens out of Korean ones. In fact, not uncommonly, he did not learn Korean in earnest until he entered higher education, in this case a teacher's college. Ha passed his teacher-licensing exam and began teaching elementary school. Ha entered Dong-a University, but did not complete his studies, and after serving his military service in 1958, began a career as a writer. Work Although Ha Geun-chan is a writer who belongs to the ‚Äúpostwar generation,‚Äù his literary concern does not include urban devastation or the consciousness of petit-bourgeois as shaped in the aftermath of the war, which characterize other works of fiction from that generation. Rather, he uses rural landscape and simple-hearted country folk to shed light on another dimension of the Korean War's traumatic impact on Korean people. ‚ÄúSuffering of Two Generations‚Äù presents a man who lost an arm during World War II and his only son, who returns home from the Korean War, having lost his leg. Yet the simplicity of the man and his son, who accept their tragedy as a fate to be overcome, affirms the possibility of rejuvenation.

In ‚ÄúThe Royal Tombs and Occupying Forces,‚Äù (Wangneunggwa judungun) a dedicated tomb keeper, who tries to protect the sacred grounds from being used as a site for prostitution, is horrified to discover that his only daughter has had sexual relations with foreign soldiers. At times comical and even obtuse, Ha Geunchan's characters nonetheless possess the strength of will to survive, the heartiness to endure and the regenerative spirit rooted in simple faith. The author maintains a sympathetic attitude towards his subjects without drifting towards sentimentality.Source-attribution\\"Ha Geunchan\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Works in Translation * The suffering of Two Generations (2013) * The Spring Song, Ill-Fated Father and Son, The Color of Mugwort, in Two Travellers.

science. He has been characterised as \\"fanatically Lamarckian, atheist, monist, materialist and determinist\\".Fernando Vidal, Piaget before Piaget, Harvard University Press, 1994, p.47  Biography  He obtained his Bachelor of Science degree at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, where he later worked as an associate-trainer in the laboratory of Louis Pasteur. He then became an assistant in the laboratory of chemical physiology at the √âcole pratique des Hautes √©tudes under the directorship of Emile Duclaux. In 1889-90 he performed his military service in French Indochina as a participant of the Mission Pavie. Inspired by the work of Elie Metchnikoff, he supported his doctorate in science with a study on intracellular digestion in protozoa (1891). In 1891 he was sent by Pasteur to Sao Paulo in order to conduct investigations of endemic yellow fever.Rep√®res chronologiques Service des Archives de l'Institut Pasteur F√©lix Le Dantec (1869-1917) In 1893 he was appointed lecturer of zoology at the University of Lyon, where he continued studies of intracellular digestion. Later, he returned to Paris (1896), where he worked in the laboratory of Alfred Giard at the √âcole Normale Superieure and taught classes in embryology at the Sorbonne. During this time period, he began publishing a series of works on the philosophy of science. In 1900-01 he was stricken by tuberculosis, forcing a lengthy stay at the Hauteville sanatorium. Here he engaged in long discussions with a priest on the subjects of religion and atheism, publishing the book Le conflit (1901) as a result. In 1902, he returned to the Sorbonne, where from 1908, he taught classes in general biology. The Lyc√©e F√©lix Le Dantec in Lannion is named in his honor.Etudier √† Lannion Tr√©gor Lyc√©e Le Dantec Evolution Le Dantec was a supporter of Lamarckian evolution. His book Lamarckiens et Darwiniens was reviewed in the Nature journal as \\"a well-intended, but scarcely adequate, endeavour to reconcile the Darwinian with the Lamarckian conception of evolution.\\"F. A. D. (1900). Lamarckiens et Darwiniens; Discussion de quelqites Th√©ories sur la Formation des Esp√®ces. Nature 62: 388. He rejected the ideas of August Weismann and proposed his own biochemical theory of heredity which allowed for the inheritance of acquired characters.Bowler, Peter J. (1983). The Eclipse of Darwinism: Anti-Darwinian Evolutionary Theories in the Decades Around 1900. Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 113-114. Scientism Le Dantec was a positivist who found the approach of scientism useful: :\\"I believe in the future of Science: I believe that Science and Science alone will solve all the questions that make sense; I believe that it will penetrate to the mysteries of our emotional life and that it will even explain to me the origin and the structure of the hereditary anti-scientific mysticism that coexists with me in the most absolute scientism. But I am also convinced that men ask themselves many questions that mean nothing. Science will show the absurdity of these questions by not answering them, which will prove that they do not have an answer.\\" (Grande revue, 1911)  Selected works  * Le d√©terminisme biologique et la personnalit√© conscience, 1897 - Biological determinism and conscious personality. * Evolution individuelle et h√©r√©dit√©, 1898 - Individual evolution and heredity. * Lamarckiens et Darwiniens, 1899 - Darwinism and Lamarckism. * √âl√©ments de philosophie biologique, 1907 Paris: Felix Alcan Elements of Biological Philosophy * L'ath√©isme, 1907 - Atheism. * La crise du transformisme, 1909 - The crisis of transformation. * Le chaos et l'harmonie universelle, 1911 - Chaos and universal harmony. * Contre la M√©taphysique.

The group took its name from the village of Oeldorf (a part of the municipality of K√ºrten, 40 kilometers east of Cologne and seven kilometers from the central village of K√ºrten), where they lived and worked in a rented farmhouse . They had their own studio for electronic music and studio productions, and in the barn adjacent to the house they were able to present concerts for audiences up to about 300 people, although they also performed in various other places. They also published their own music. The core members were Peter E√∂tv√∂s (at that time best known as a composer) who performed electronics and keyboards, the violinist/violist and composer Joachim Krist, electronics specialist and composer Mes√≠as Maiguashca, who also played keyboards, and Maiguashca's wife, the cellist Gaby Schumacher. They were closely associated with the Cologne-based Feedback Studio, consisting of David C. Johnson, Johannes Fritsch, and Rolf Gehlhaar (; ). Through their long-standing contact with the Westdeutscher Rundfunk, the Oeldorf Group was able to receive commissions for compositions, invitations to perform in the Musik der Zeit concert series, as well as having many of their summer concerts recorded for the late-night broadcasts of WDR3 . One example was Oeldorf 8 by Mes√≠as Maiguashca, a two-year retrospective portrait of the Oeldorf Group commissioned by the WDR. It consists of a series of eight short pieces for four instrumentalists (clarinet, violin, cello, electric organ/synthesizer) and tape, which may be played either simultaneously or continuously without a break. The score is dedicated to Maiguashca's three Oeldorf colleagues who, together with the composer, premiered the composition at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse in 1974 (; ). The barn in which the Oeldorf Summer-night Concerts were held The Oeldorf Summer-night Concerts began as no more than private country musical soirees for a small circle of composers, but quickly grew to become a byword in the Cologne music scene. The 1973 summer season consisted of three concerts, the last of which took place on 23 June and consisted entirely of premieres of new compositions: David C. Johnson's Progranca‚Äîein Oeld≈ìuvre, Ulrich Stranz's D√©ja-vue, Silvio Fortiƒá's Drei Lieder aus dem unvollendeten und unvollendbaren Zyklus 'la merde de si√®cle', and Emmanuel Nunes's The Blending Season . In 1978 the group joined with the British Hydra Ensemble to inaugurate the newly built hall of the London Goethe Institute in a week of concerts and seminars organised by Rolf Gehlhaar . Characteristics Live electronics were an important aspect of the Oeldorf performances, as illustrated by the Portuguese composer Emanuel Nunes's 73-Oeldorf-75, for two electric organs and electronics, which was written for the group . According to Maiguashca, > Stockhausen's group was different from both ours and Feedback because it was > fully professional. His group was based at Westdeutsche Rundfunk and had the > advantage of having \\"state of the art\\" professional equipment and setups. No > expense was spared. A Stockhausen concert involved sometimes truck loads of > WDR equipment, and a brace of technicians. We were much more modest. Our > equipment was semi-professional: we carried our own loudspeakers and did all > the setups ourselves. Guest artists In addition to the core members, guest artists also frequently appeared. In the 1973 summer series, Australian dancer Philippa Cullen (who had come to Germany to work with Karlheinz Stockhausen, who lived nearby) performed with a Theremin connected to a synthesizer, and the Slovenian violinist Miha Pogaƒçnik played Bach‚Äôs partitas for solo violin (; ). Clarinetists Walter Seyfarth, David Smeyers, Suzanne Stephens, and Beate Zelinsky appeared at various times, and Stockhausen performed in his own composition Herbstmusik, which was written for the group in 1974 (; ). In 1976, the Hungarian violinist J√°nos N√©gyesy performed the violin sonatas by Charles Ives .

Forming as a depression in the Arabian Sea on November 8, the cyclone strengthened into a deep depression before making landfall in the Puntland region of Somalia at peak intensity on November 11. After making landfall, the cyclone rapidly weakened over land and degenerated into a well-marked low pressure area later on the same day. Although the cyclone remained weak throughout its life, torrential rainfall associated with the system killed 162 people across Somalia, and left about 300 others missing. Meteorological history On November 6, 2013, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a broad low-pressure area over the southeastern Arabian Sea. Accompanied by bursts of convective activity, the low tracked generally westward over an area slightly favoring tropical cyclogenesis. Moderate wind shear offset the positive effects of upper-level outflow, though high sea surface temperatures aided further development. By November 8, organized banding features wrapped around the northwestern side of a consolidating circulation. Subsequently, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the disturbance as Depression ARB 01 at 1000 UTC, making it the first tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea during 2013. At this time, the depression was located about 680 km (425 mi) east-southeast of Ras Binnah, Somalia. Based on continued development, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert two hours later before declaring the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 2100 UTC. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system on a westward course that would bring it over Somalia in two days. Some limited intensification was anticipated, though the JTWC also noted the potential for dissipation before landfall. Early on November 9, an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit pass of the system revealed a mid-level eye feature, indicative of an intensifying system; however, scatterometer data showed little changes in intensity. Around this time, IMD assessed the system to have intensified into a deep depression and attained its peak intensity, with three-minute sustained winds of 55 km/h (35 mph) and a barometric pressure of 1002 mbar (hPa; 29.59 inHg). The JTWC estimated the system to have been slightly stronger at peak intensity, with one-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Continued moderate wind shear displaced most convection to the northwest of the center of circulation, counteracting the favorable poleward outflow prevailing over the cyclone. The wind shear took its toll by November 10, leaving the storm's center devoid of showers and thunderstorms. More pronounced decay took place later in the day as the storm neared the coastline, with land interaction disrupting the circulation. Between 2300 UTC on November 10 and 0000 UTC on November 11, the deep depression made landfall along the border of the Nugal and Bari regions; the JTWC issued its final warning on the system shortly after landfall. According to the JTWC, the system was only the fifth known tropical storm to make landfall in Somalia since the start of accurate satellite measurements in 1966. Although it retained some organized convection, the system gradually weakened as it moved inland; it was last noted by the IMD later on November 11 as it neared Ethiopia. Preparations and impact ARB 01 after landfall on November 11 On November 9, Puntland's Interior Minister Ali Yusuf Ali Hosh announced on Radio Garowe that the Puntland authorities had been informed by international meteorological agencies that flood-inducing cyclones were expected to hit Somalia's northeastern coast. The Puntland government concurrently firmed up on its surveillance system, alerting regional authorities, fishermen and other civilians of the impending tropical storm through the local media and via text messages. The cyclone primarily impacted the Alula, Bayla, Dangorayo, Eyl and Hafun districts. Up to of rainfall was registered, around more than the average regional amount per year. According to the Puntland government, 162 fatalities were confirmed while an additional 300 people were listed as missing. Of 650 medical consultations, around 80 deaths were confirmed from hypothermia and exposure, mainly of children and the elderly. According to the Puntland Disaster Management and Rescue committee, the torrential rains inundated littoral towns and faraway rural areas at a higher level than expected. A number of bridges, villages, buildings, homes and boats were destroyed during the storm. Photos taken by Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) units using special boats captured images of submerged dirt roads between urban and rural areas, as well as debris from flattened houses and fallen trees that was blocking off parts of the Bosaso-Galkayo highway. Additionally, in part due to icy rain, around 100,000 livestock died. Regular flights to and from the Bender Qasim International Airport in Bosaso and the Abdullahi Yusuf International Airport in Galkayo were also affected by the cyclone's torrential rains, and the airports' gravel runways sustained some damage. Mobile phone masts were likewise destroyed, and electricity was interrupted. Aftermath The Puntland government established a Puntland Disaster Management and Rescue committee to oversee local relief efforts in the wake of the cylone. Puntland Maritime Police Force units and government rescue teams were also deployed to the impacted areas. PMPF troops assisted in the transportation of emergency supplies, including blankets, tents, non- perishable food items and medicines. Accessibility to the most affected areas was slowed by flash floods and the collapse of a bridge linking Bosaso with the administrative capital Garowe. Government rescue teams consequently utilized donkey carts to reach remote localities. The Puntland Highway Authority (PHA) also established an alternative land route for trucks transporting relief materials. In total, the Puntland government sent 32 trucks carrying supplies to the affected areas. Along with the Puntland regional authorities, the Federal Government of Somalia declared a state of emergency in the cyclone struck areas. It also indicated that $1 million would be earmarked for the impacted communities. In addition, the Somaliland regional administration in northwestern Somalia pledged to provide humanitarian assistance. Neighboring Djibouti and Ethiopia also dispatched relief shipments. According to OCHA, strong coordination between the Puntland government and humanitarian agencies led to an effective emergency response for the nearly 30,000 people affected by the cyclone. The UN World Food Programme sent 340 tons in food rations, intended to sustain around 4,000 impacted households for one month. The International Federation of the Red Cross likewise treated 757 individuals for acute respiratory infections and skin-related diseases over three days, and recommended that clean drinking water be made available to the impacted areas to avert waterborne illnesses like diarrhoea. In conjunction with the Somali authorities, the Qatar Alliance led by the Qatar Red Crescent also distributed essential supplies to around 1,000 impacted families. By November 25, focus had shifted to rebuilding lost livelihoods, including the restocking of livestock. To this end, the Puntland government distributed around 15,887 heads of livestock in December to hundreds of pastoralist households affected by the storm. According to Puntland officials, the Bosaso and Galkayo airports' runways were also undergoing repair work.

He grew up as a sickly infant, who first thought of entering a career in writing when he read The Count of Monte Cristo while in the hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis. He married Sun-nam in 1958 and made his literary debut with the publication of Warning Zone. In 1961 his writing brought him into conflict with the government and when his work Land of Excrement (Î∂ÑÏßÄ) was re-published in North Korea. Nam continued to write anti-government pieces, and was imprisoned two more times. Work Using literary techniques of hyperbole, irony, allegory, and satire to depict inverted values of the modern man and the society in which he lives, Nam Jeonghyeon has unleashed strong invectives against the oppressive political regime and the corrupt society. ‚ÄúThe Land of Excrement‚Äù (Bunji, 1965), for example, likens post-war South Korea as a polluted land overrun by cunning, flattery, and abuses of power on the one hand, and by American imperialism on the other. An acerbic indictment of the South Korean situation in the 1960s, the work was later reprinted in the North Korean journal, Unification Front Line (Tongil jeonseon). This fact was used by South Korean authorities, who then found Nam in violation of the Anti- Communist Law and sentenced him to imprisonment. He was released in 1967 but was jailed a second time in 1974 on charges of violating the notorious Presidential Emergency Ordinance No.1. It is precisely such abuses of power and the resulting injustice, of which he has been a victim, that Nam denounces in his fiction. The voice of critique reaches its height in ‚ÄúA Letter to Father‚Äù (Buju jeonsangseo). But Nam Jeonghyeon's critique of all-pervasive injustice, as scathing as it is, can often leave the reader feeling somewhat hollow. His works stop at addressing surface phenomena and fail to reflect on what may lie crouched underneath.Source-attribution\\"Nam Jung-hyun\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# Works in translation * Land of Excrement (Î∂ÑÏßÄ, 2013) Works in Korean (partial) Short Stories * ‚ÄúA Letter to Father‚Äù (Buju jeonsangseo) * ‚ÄúWarning Zone‚Äù (Gyeonggo guyeok) * ‚ÄúAn Imitation Corpse‚Äù (Moui siche) * ‚ÄúWhat Are You?‚Äù (Neoneun mwonya) * ‚ÄúAn Epilogue to Revolution‚Äù (Hyeongmyeong hugi) * ‚ÄúMr. Heoheo‚Äù (Heoheo seonsaeng) * ‚ÄúThe Land of Excrement‚Äù (Bunji, 1965) Novels * The Sound of Loving (Saranghaneun sori).

Plot Under the backdrop of a city with a mysterious killer on the loose, story introduces to an exceptional young cafe owner, who possess the ability of rapid healing along with heightened physical abilities. The story begins with his encounter with a strange-looking little girl who asks to borrow his phone. He gladly obliges but, as he is appreciating the evening breeze, the girl's hat is blown off and she chases it out into traffic. He dives in front of the child to protect her and is hit by a truck. Some distance away a jewel cracks and a shadowy figure celebrates finding something.Webcomic/Ability - Television Tropes & Idioms Characters=Han Yu-Hwa Han Yu-Hwa is the main protagonist of the series. After saving Su-Jin Ji from a truck accident and an Another, he is drawn into the world of the supernatural. Yu-Hwa has average looks. His blonde hair is tied back in a ponytail. He wears metal earrings on both ears. Irrationally selfless, he throws himself into life or death situations with almost no regard for his own well being, doing what he can to assist someone. Back when he was a kid, his contemporaries threw him out, once they noticed his unusual ability. He has stayed away from any sort of company since then. Sa-Ryun Sa-Ryu is the primary antagonist in the series. He saves Han Yu- Hwa from an Another, and helps him develop his abilities. Han Yu-Hwa believes this as an act of selflessness, but in reality, Sa-Ryun is only helping him develop his abilities so that he can steal them later on. He was a former member of the organization of Atran which is supposed to be an ally of Hon. He was given the title 'Hunter' for being an extraordinary assassin of Atran and is somewhere on the top of the Most dangerous list. Yet he was deemed a traitor after killing the heir of Atran's ruler because he found out about the whereabouts of the Pandora's box and was about to report it to Atran. This would be bad for extremely powerful Anothers like Sa-Ryun, Mase and Jacra. Despite not being allies, they don't seem to be attacking each other because of this very same reason. Once Atran would get their hands on Pandora's box and open it, the Ruler of Atran would become the ruler of the world which would strip every high level Another of their title because their powers would be useless. Sa-Ryun has many abilities he uses and also some hidden ones we don't know about. His favorite technique is Sa-Ryun Spheres which are red spheres appearing mid air, attacking his enemy with beams of light. Su-Jin Ji Su-Jin Ji (also called as \\"The Young Lady\\") is the head of Hon. At the start of series, She is saved by Han Yu-Hwa. She looks like a child in her early tens. She has a short figure with long brown hairs, is very bright and intelligent for her age. In the begin of the manhwa you really wouldn't take her for the type to lead a whole organization, but instead like a spoiled rich girl. Despite being just a kid, she is also the key to open the pandora's box which Atran found and therefore planned on attacking Hon so they could capture the Young Lady. Mase Mase is a mysterious character running the Hon. He acts as a protector to Su-Jin Ji, the head of Hon. He seems very strict and tries to keep a stable relationship between Hon and Atran. Yet he did not know about Atran's ulterior motive of attacking Hon if it weren't for Sa-Ryun taking away their focus and making Atran focus on him instead. Mase decided to use Han Yu-Hwa as bait to lure out Sa-Ryun before, because he found out they were connected after Yu-Hwa used Sa-ryuns spheres to defeat some Anothers who were about to kill Un. Mase was willing to give both Sa-Ryun and Han Yu-Hwa to Atran to avoid a conflict with Atran. After Sa-Ryun's fight with Lector (it isn't sure if Mase was watching until the end to dive in and snatch away Lector's orb), he dove in to fight the heavily wounded Sa-Ryun and to capture him. Yet during this fight, Lectors orb got absorbed by Han Yu-Hwa, making both Mase and Sa-Ryun stop fighting. That's when Sa-Ryun explained why he was being chased by Atran being him having killed the heir of Atran's ruler. It was all to prevent them getting their hands on the Pandora's box, which Mase didn't seem to know about. Until the end Mase is an overpowered character who seems to be able to hold his own, even with Atran's top Anothers. Ye Rin Ye Rin is high-ranking member of Hon and shows a small attraction towards Han Yu-Hwa. Has ability to see 'foot prints' left behind by spiritual energy and uses hand-to-hand combat. She is supposed to be on the Most Dangerous List, but was left out on purpose to be one of Hon's secret weapons. She is a halfling (half human, half Another) Un Un is a high-ranking member of Hon and is seen protecting Han Yu-Hwa quite often along with Yu Rin. Un uses a pair of tonfa like weapons to channel his energy into to make more concentrated and deadly attacks. Jacra Head of the Salamander's, Some aggressive-type group, still not connected to Atran. For him, the perfect world is where the strong consume the weak and that's how it should be. He seems intrigued by Han Yu-Hwa being able to withstand his attacks even though any other person or Another would have died right away. He joins Atran's attack on Hon because he was being paid, but when he heard about Atran's real motive of capturing Pandora's key, he has a change of heart and decides to give Han Yu-Hwa a fight with his disciple Tar, a highly dangerous Another, with the condition they'd leave if Han Yu-Hwa would defeat him. Jacra is said to be right next to Sa-Ryun on the most dangerous list, it is not known which one of them is superior in strength, yet both seem to respect and acknowledge each other's power. Setting It is set in a fantasy world. An Another is a type of supernatural beings which live among normal people. People don't see their real appearance, though their look can be really different and inhuman. Anothers have special powers. Anothers seem to have difficult relationships with each other. The Strong can eat the weak to obtain power. Vocabulary Ability ‚Äì 'Anothership'. Power inside Another, non-human beings. Abilities vary differently from each Another which includes physical (regeneration, healing, strengthening, etc.) and magical (energy balls, electricity stealing, extra-smelling, step-seeing, etc.). Anothers ‚Äì nonhuman creatures that live among humans. In the eyes of human beings Another look like fellow humans but they have animal ears, fangs, eyes or a totally non-human appearance. Orb ‚Äì An essence of an Another's power. A sphere that remains after an Another's death holds only part of its power. An another can consume this sphere to obtain power, only a part of a sphere's power will be gained by the taker. Only Anothers and half-breeds (and Yu-Hwa as an exception) can consume spheres. Extremely Dangerous List ‚Äì A list of extremely dangerous Anothers and half- breeds whose powers are much stronger than the average Another. Usually they have enormous defense and often some kind of 'special attacks'. Pandora's Box ‚Äì An ancient artifact with the power to reload a world. Organisations=Hon Hon is an organisation headed by Su Jin to protect weaker Anothers. While providing a policy of non-harming weaker ones, Hon has plenty of enemies among other organisations. Authorities in the human world know about the existence of Hon. Atran Atran is an organisation that acts under a motto of strong rules over the weaker ones. Atran opposes Hon's work. Sa-Ryun previously worked as an assassin in Atran until he killed the Heir of the ruler and was deemed a traitor. Salamander Ruled by Jacra, this is some aggressive-type group, still not connected to Atran.

Main St. in Anna, Illinois. The library was designed by Walter Burley Griffin in 1913 and constructed in 1913-14\\\\. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 9, 1978. Architecture Walter Burley Griffin studied under Frank Lloyd Wright, and while his early work was similar to Wright's Prairie School designs, his later work exhibited an Expressionist influence as well; the Stinson Memorial Library was one of the latter designs. The building's exterior consists of three main design elements: a tall limestone base, a concrete band of windows encircling the top of the base, and large concrete pillars on either side of the entrance. The limestone in the base is roughly cut and coursed to give the building a natural appearance. The windows in the upper band are made from leaded glass and feature concrete piers on each side. The sill and lintel of the windows continuously circle the building; the lintel is topped by the library's low hip roof. The library's entrance leads to a vestibule with three flights of stairs, one heading to the upper-level library and two to the lower-level auditorium. The library was designed as a single open room with bookshelves delineating the different areas within the space. The room is accentuated by decorative light fixtures and stained glass patterns. The auditorium, which features a stage for performances, is lit by five windows on the rear side of the building. History In 1903, Anna businessman Robert Burns Stinson bequeathed his estate to the city to fund a public library. By 1913, the donation had grown large enough to fund the construction of a library, and Griffin was hired to design the building. While the lowest bid on the library initially came from a contractor in St. Louis, Griffin hired F. P. Mueller of Chicago to construct the building, as he was concerned that the original contractor could not carry out his design. Work on the building began in 1913 and was completed in 1914. The library was dedicated on August 14, 1914, shortly after Griffin relocated to Australia; it was one of the last buildings Griffin designed in America. The building has only undergone minor alterations since its construction and still serves as Anna's public library.

His early poems discarded the trend of nihilistic, traditional lyric poetry from the postwar period, to explore the possibilities of transcending the pain of reality within the tense relationship between the dreams of self and of the external world. Even as his poetry addressed the conflict and strife of conflicting ideas or elements like pain and celebration, water and fire, heaviness and lightness, and sadness and happiness, it explored the dynamic tension of a mentality that sought to transform pain into happiness, and reality into a dream.

The film stars Vidya Balan and features Ali Fazal, Arjan Bajwa, Supriya Pathak, Rajendra Gupta and Tanvi Azmi in supporting roles. It tells the story of Bilqees \\"Bobby\\" Ahmed, a Hyderabadi woman who aspires to be a detective despite facing a series of obstacles.  Plot  Living in a middle-class orthodox family of Old Hyderabad, Bilqees Ahmed aka Bobby (Vidya Balan) is a wannabe private detective. She lives with her Abba (Rajendra Gupta), Ammi (Supriya Pathak), Kausar Khala (Tanvi Azmi) and two younger sisters including Noor (Benaf Dadachandji) in Moghalpura area near Charminar. To pursue her passion of spying, Bobby solves petty neighbourhood cases such as helping Tasawwur (Ali Fazal), a TV show host, to get rid of marriage proposals brought home by his parents. Bobby finally gets her big break when a rich NRI Anees Khan (Kiran Kumar) hands her a case of finding two missing girls named 'Niloufer' and 'Aamna' with a birth mark on their hand and shoulder respectively. To solve the case, Bobby takes up many get-ups such as 'beggar', 'peon', 'hawker', 'nerd student', 'astrologer' and even a fake 'TV producer'. After locating the targets, Khan pays her a tremendous fee and also offers huge amount of money to both girls' fathers for reasons unknown to Bobby. Khan also hands over his third and final case of finding a boy with a missing toe named 'Ali'. Meanwhile, Bobby and Tasawwur's family fix their marriage leaving both into the dilemma of how to get rid of this situation. A local goon Lala (Arjan Bajwa) also offers a case to Bobby to break Lala's girlfriend Aafreen (Anupriya Goenka)'s marriage, which is forcefully fixed by her mother Saida (Zarina Wahab). On Bobby's denial, Lala makes her realize that she has been helping the NRI for a wrong cause. Doubting on that Bobby tries to know the whereabouts of the two girls, but gets to know that both girls have gone missing. Scared and shocked, Bobby takes help from Tasawwur and sneaks into Khan's 5 star hotel room to check his background, only to be caught and thrown out by Khan and the hotel staff. But Bobby manages to get a hold of Khan's diary and his old photograph, which later gets into the hands of Lala, who since then starts following Bobby. Khan now suddenly goes into hiding and Bobby starts searching for him with the belief that Khan will not leave the town without his third target Ali. With the help of clues in Khan's diary such as a London based library's stamp and a Biryani order from a local restaurant, Bobby gets to know about Khan's background and later Khan is shown following Ali. It turns out to be a trap to capture Khan. With the twist in the climax, it is revealed that the three people Khan was looking for were his long lost children during communal riots. Khan has offered money to both girl's foster parents for helping them and sent the girls to London to pursue higher education. Tasawwur also enters the scene along with Lala who is actually Khan's long lost son 'Ali'. The film ends with Bobby becoming a famous detective, while she and Tasawwur are now in love with each other but are still confused about their marriage.

Launched in 2007, it is operated in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 93.48¬∞ east. Built by the Indian Space Research Organisation, INSAT-4B is based upon the I-3K satellite bus. It had a mass at launch of , with a dry mass of and was expected to operate for twelve years. Two solar arrays power the satellite, while its communications payload consists of twelve C and twelve transponders. Arianespace was contracted to launch INSAT-4B using an Ariane 5 ECA carrier rocket. The launch occurred on 11 March 2007 at 22:03 UTC, from ELA-3 at Kourou. The Skynet 5A military communications satellite for the British Ministry of Defence was launched aboard the same rocket. INSAT-4B was successfully inserted into geosynchronous transfer orbit, from which it raised itself into geostationary orbit using a liquid-fuelled apogee motor. It received the International Designator 2007-007A and Satellite Catalog Number 30793. As of 11 November 2013, it is in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , inclination of 0.07 degrees and an orbital period of 23.93 hours.  Partial power failure  On 10 July 2010 INSAT-4B suffered a disruption in power supply from one of the two solar panels, rendering half of its transponder capacity useless. After review the cause of malfunction was found out to be electric arcing in slip ring of one of the solar panels. Similar partial power supply failure also affected Eutelsat W2M now known as Afghansat 1 and caused delay in launch of GSAT-8 due to required design changes in relevant power systems of satellite bus.

Name The ethnonym Paakantyi means \\"River people\\", formed from paaka river and the suffix -ntyi, meaning \\"belonging to\\", thus \\"belonging to the river\\". They refer to themselves as wimpatjas. The name Paakantyi therefore simply means the River People. Language Traditionally they speak the Paakantyi language of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan family, and one of the three major Aboriginal languages for the people of present-day Broken Hill region. The major work on the Paakantyi language has been that of the late linguist Luise Hercus. Country Paakantyi indigenous house in 1935 The Paakantyi dwelt along the Darling River, from Wilcannia downstream almost to Avoca. Inland from either side of the Darling, their territory extended to a distance of roughly 20‚Äì30 miles. According to Norman Tindale, they inhabited an area of some They lived also in the back country from the river, around the Paroo River and Broken Hill. They were close neighbours of the Maraura, further down the Great Darling Anabranch. The landscape is characterized by brick-red sandhills and grey clay flats. The Barkindji today derive from several dialects, all speaking variations of the same language or Barlku. Historically these dialects were distinct groups, but with colonisation these groups are more singularly recognised as Bsarkindji today, with the language, Barkindji barlku and intermarriage linking these smaller dialect groups together in far western nsw. Baarundji Wilyakali - wilyali Pulakali - Pulaali Pantjikali - Pantjarli Wanyuparlku - wanyuwalku Barkindji Barrindji Thankakali - Dhangaali Marawara - maraura The land was harsh: drought was not rare. When parched conditions set in, the Paakantyi would withdraw into the backcountry around the few perennial springs, and cull the starving wildlife that came to slake themselves there. Mythology In Paakantyi lore, the landscape of and around the river was created by Ngatji, the dreamtime rainbow serpent This figure is still believed to travel underground from waterhole to waterhole, and should not be disturbed. His presence is seen in such phenomena as when whirly breezes stir up the Darling's waterways. History of contact A photograph by Frederic Bonney. Bonney is in the pith helmet, Old Peter is on the right, Wonko Mary is on the far left wearing a mourning cap. Another man holds a boomerang and a short throwing stick known as a kutjurru. Behind them are two barbed spears and in the fire is a billy can and a recycled tin. The first colonizer who travelled through their territory, Thomas Mitchell, appears to be referring to the Barkindji when he mentions the Occa tribe in the area of Wilcannia. One estimate of the population for the period immediately before contact with whites, taking into account the hard climatic conditions, suggested that the could have sustained no more than 100 people. On the other hand, Simpson Newland, a contemporary familiar with the district where they lived, wrote in illustration of the point that:\\" we cannot but admit that our happy prosperous lot in these bright colonies is purchased at the cost of the welfare, nay, even the lives of the possessors of the soil,\\" and illustrated the point in the following words: > A few years ago the aboriginals of the Upper Darling were comparatively > numerous; now they, in common with other tribes wherever the European has > settled, have nearly passed away. This has been brought about by no > epidemic, nor the use of intoxicants, or cold, or hunger; none of these have > had much to do with it. I can vouch for their being well fed and clothed, > and for years spirits were almost entirely kept from them; yet they died > off, the old and young, the strong and weakly alike, sometimes with > startling suddenness, at others by a wasting sickness of a few days, weeks, > or months.' The people the explorer Mitchell encountered and called Occa, are, according to Norman Tindale, probably to be identified with the Paakantyi. Tindale argues that Mitchell misheard the name for their section of the river, Ba:ka. Sometime around 1850, according to elders' memories, an epidemic attacked the Paakantyi and the neighbouring Naualko, affecting their numbers drastically tribes, killing off an estimated third of each tribe. Panic overtook the two peoples, they took flight, leaving those struck by the illness unburied in the sandhills, - the mortality was particularly high around Peri Lake - as they sought refuge at the Paroo river, where the disease was unknown. Frederic Bonney was one of the earliest settlers in their area, and ran stock there for 15 years. In the nineteenth century, they were much reduced by disease and they ended up working for the immigrants who had invaded their lands. Pictures were taken by Bonney at Momba Station over 15 years from the mid-1860s down to 1880 which have provided a sympathetic and accurate picture of these people. Bonney wrote sympathetically of the Paakantyi, stating that they were \\"naturally honest, truthful, and kind-hearted. Their manner is remarkably courteous and to little children, they are very kind. Affectionate and faithful to chosen companions, also showing exceeding respect to aged persons and willingly attending to their wants.\\" With the disintegration of traditional tribal ways, the Paakantyi have been afflicted by alcoholism, high unemployment, and have a high incidence of inter-group and domestic violence. The Paakantyi were considered to be a \\"vanishing tribe\\" by the mid-twentieth century. In recent times their descendants are concentrated in Wilcannia. At a conservative estimate of Wilcannia's approximately 600 residents, 68% are of Paakantyi descent. The town enjoyed a colonial boom, being the third largest inland port in those times, and was occasionally referred to, humorously and ironically, as \\"Queen City of the West\\", alluding to the nickname of the powerful river port in the US, Cincinnati. Overgrazing by cattle and sheep, the arrival of rabbits in the early 1890s and the Federation drought led to soil degradation and extensive loss of vegetation. Non-native species of fish introduced into the river system also damaged its ecology. In later periods the extraction of water for cotton farming higher up on the northern reaches of the Darling has drastically reduced water flow through this area for tribes once known as the \\"people of the river.\\" Native title In 1997, the Barkindji people filed a lawsuit claiming the national native title tribunal. To support their claim they collected documents from traditional owners and reports written by anthropologists, historians and linguists. Their native title was officially recognised by the Australian government, in a ruling handed down by federal judge Jayne Jagot, after 18 years of legal battle, in 2015. The area covers from the South Australian border, eastwards to Tilpa, south to Wentworth and northwards to Wanaaring.

In Byzantine times came to be applied to independent or semi-independent rulers in the periphery of the Byzantine world. Ptolemaic Kingdom The term originates in Hellenistic times, when topos (œÑœåœÄŒøœÇ, \\"place, locale\\") was established as an administrative unit, most notably in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, but also among the Seleucids and Attalids, although less well attested in comparison to Ptolemaic practice. The Ptolemaic topos comprised a number of villages (komai, sing. komƒì) under a toparchƒìs and was in turn a subdivision of the nomos (nome or province), which is governed by a strategos. In Ptolemaic Egypt, the toparches was usually an Egyptian, and was responsible for the collection of revenue and administration, much as the nomarchƒìs for the nomos and the komarchƒìs for each komƒì. In an account, the toparchies constituted the hyparchies such as Gaulanitis, Galilaia, Samaraia, Judaia, Peraia, and Idumaia during the New Testament times. The title remained in use under the Roman Empire in the Greek East, for the governor of a district. Such districts were then called \\"toparchies\\" (sing. toparchy, from Greek œÑŒøœÄŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±, toparchia). Byzantine Empire In the 6th century, in the Novellae Constitutiones of Emperor Justinian I, the term toparchƒìs was used to encompass all local magistrates, both civilian and military. More often, however, Byzantine writers use the term to refer to local monarchs, especially during the 10th‚Äì13th centuries, when, according to the Byzantinist Paul Lemerle, \\"a toparchƒìs is the independent ruler of a foreign territory adjoining the Empire... He is in some manner under the influence of the Empire, as it is supposed that he may rebel against the Byzantines\\". This usage extended not only to actual breakaway or de facto autonomous Byzantine governors, who appear during the military crises and administrative disintegration of the 11th‚Äì12th centuries, but was also applied to independent rulers, usually on the periphery of the Byzantine Empire (e.g. the Emir of Crete, various Turkish lords in Anatolia, or the rulers of Bulgaria or Serbia), of territories which the Byzantines considered rightfully theirs. In this context, the late 11th-century writer Kekaumenos dedicates a large part of his Strategikon to advising the toparchƒìs on his conduct and dealings with the emperor and the other Byzantine governors.

It has three basic forms, being sometimes ruffled, sometimes reclining and sometimes encrusting, and each form is typically found in a different habitat. This seaweed occurs worldwide. It is the type species of the genus Lobophora, the type locality being the Antilles in the West Indies. Description Lobophora variegata has three different morphological forms; an erect ruffled form, a decumbent or reclining form which grows flattened against the substrate and an encrusting form. Each of these forms may dominate its habitat. This seaweed is generally greenish-brown or pale brown. The sporangial sori are scattered across both surfaces of the thalli (fronds). The ruffled form grows in ball- like clumps of wavy fronds as a result of the continued growth of the lateral blades. It is most often found in sandy areas and among turtle grass (Thalassia testudinem). It is usually anchored to the seabed or the prop roots of the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle by a holdfast, but it sometimes forms loose masses which roll about with the movement of the water. The decumbent form grows in overlapping flat blades which may cover large areas of the seabed with a roof-tile like pattern. It is most abundant on back reefs, on shallow patch reefs and on the lower surfaces of hard corals. In deeper water it forms thin semicircular plates projecting horizontally from vertical rock faces or from under overhangs. The encrusting form resembles Ralfsia and consists of irregular low-growing lobes attached to the substrate by a matted, rhizoidal holdfast. It grows in very shallow water on coral rubble, red mangrove prop roots and the waterlogged soils around mangroves. Distribution Lobophora variegata is widely distributed in tropical and warm temperate marine waters, from the intertidal zone down to at least . It is common in the western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, its range extending from Bermuda and North Carolina to Brazil. It also occurs in European waters, the Mediterranean Sea, the Azores, around the coasts of southern and eastern Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, the coasts of southeastern and southwestern Asia, the Pacific Ocean islands, northern Australia and New Zealand. Ecology Lobophora variegata is one of the commonest species of brown algae in the Caribbean area and is often abundant in shaded areas, under overhangs and in caves. It forms part of the diet of many fish and various herbivorous invertebrates. It is often covered in sediment and many epiphytes grow on the surface of the thalli. In feeding trials in Belize it has been shown that the three different forms of this seaweed have different degrees of palatability to herbivorous fish and crabs (Mithraculus sculptus). The ruffled form is the most palatable and is only found to any extent in areas with low grazing pressure such as seagrass meadows. The decumbent form is relatively unattractive to fish and crabs but is eaten in areas with high grazing pressure. It is also eaten intensively by sea urchins such as Diadema antillarum. The encrusting form is unpalatable to all the herbivores and is principally found in areas with high grazing pressure. Lobophora variegata is a widespread and successful species and it is suggested that the three forms have developed in response to variations in grazing pressure. The tissues of Lobophora variegata and other brown algae contain phlorotannins, unpalatable phenolic compounds that are thought to deter herbivory. These secondary metabolites are more abundant in Lobophora variegata growing in nutrient-poor water with a low nitrogen content than elsewhere.

The street to the south west is Cumhuriyet Street and the street to the east is Anafartalar Street. (Atat√ºrk is the founder of modern Turkey, √áankƒ±rƒ± is the name of a city to the north of Ankara, Cumhuriyet means Republic and Anfartalar was the location of a critical battle during the Gallipoli Campaign.) The only open area of the square is an area allocated to the Statue of Victory to the east of the square. History Before the formation of Republic of Turkey, Ankara was a typical Anatolian town. The only important trade center of Ankara was Ta≈ühan (i.e., \\"Stone inn\\") which was built in 1880s. The neighborhood around Ta≈ühan was also called Ta≈ühan.Ta≈ühan in Ankara history (4 December 2009) After Ankara was included in the railroad network in 1892, Ta≈ühan became one of the most important quarters of Ankara and after the Young Turk Revolution the Committee of Union and Progress built its Ankara branch office building to the west of Ta≈ühan.Ministry of Culture page / Ankara - Kurtulu≈ü Sava≈üƒ± M√ºzesi (I.

These peppers are the fruit of an herbaceous annual plant of the family Solanaceae. It is short -- -- , triangular and pointed at the end (similar to a bottle capAntoni Maria Alcover's dictionary with a fresh weight of between 17 ‚Äì 20 grams, a dry yield (whole pepper) about 18 ‚Äì 20% and sweet. The collection is done in steps, three harvests, and is unique because the fruits grow erect, looking skyward. Origins Tap de Cort√≠ Plantation in Sant Jordi, Palma de Mallorca Paprika arrived in Majorca in the late sixteenth century from America and it quickly became a popular condiment. Already in the nineteenth century Archduke Ludwig Salvador of Austria (Die Balearen) pointed out that its main use was intended as a condiment, after being sun-dried. He also stresses that the quality of the local pepper was much higher than the pepper from outside. The pepper Tap de Cort√≠ is cultivated in most villages of Majorca: Felanitx, Sa Pobla, Manacor, Sant Joan, Santa Maria, Sant Jordi, Muro, Llucmajor and Campos among others. Later, between August and October, the fa√ßade of the houses in these villages were completely covered with strings of pepper, sun-dried to keep their antioxidants or preservative power, this gave a decorative touch to the Majorca landscape. Nails can be found even today in some of the fa√ßades. Nevertheless, these images are not as common as 30 years ago. From the 70's the Tap de Cort√≠ production started to decrease due to the loss of competitiveness caused by the entry of the paprika from Murcia at a price unreachable by the Majorca farmer. Resurgence Facade of the Pilar and Joan Mir√≥ Foundation covered with peppers Tap of Corti. Son Boter, Mallorca In order to preserve the local products, in 2008 a traditional Majorcan company started a recovery campaign of paprika Tap de Cort√≠, seeding approximately 6,000 plants, that has led to the agricultural and gastronomic resurgence. In 2009 an eco-grastronomic association that believed in the potential of the product, started another recovery campaign distributing about 16,000 free seedlings to a group of ecological farmers committed to the conservation of seeds and local plant varieties. All of them were aware that a union with a diverse groups of gastronomes offered huge possibilities to bring back to the marketplace this variety of paprika on the verge of extinction. The project included different groups of volunteers like the people from the village of Santa Mar√≠a, inmates from the island's prison and a NGO working with drug addicts. Among all of them strung 3,000 kilos of peppers, in a total of 950 strings that were hung in buildings as ca s'Apotecari of Santa Mar√≠a del Cam√≠.  Preparation  Paprika Tap de Cort√≠ The peppers are collected by steps, there are until three or four harvests, when the fruit is very ripe and preferable when it having lose a high humidity grade in the plant. The optimal dried is in the sun with traditional strings of peppers (normally in form of helices or also named three ended points) that are hung in the house's fa√ßade, looking for a properly solar orientation, during fifteen days approximately, depending on various factors as the climatological. In this way the pepper natural antioxidant are not lost, like the Vitamin C, and that is the reason why the paprika become the best preservative of the sobrassada. Then it is baked at a low temperature, below 50‚Äì60¬∞ Celsius, to eliminate the last degree of moisture and facilitate the grinding. The stem is removed leaving a portion of the seeds, and crushed before grinding. The ground is done using stone mills and is necessary to do it from 5 to 6 times. Finally it is sieved and packaged.  Properties  207x207px This paprika is characterized by its red colour, inimitable aroma and a sweet taste. The ASTA index (a measure of colour) of paprika Tap de Cort√≠ is between 130 and 140 ASTAS ground with its seeds that gives to Tap de Cort√≠ vitamin E. This is a natural antioxidant which is good for seasoning typical dishes of the islands but also for Majorcan sobrassada. Furthermore, as Capsicum annuum also contains a high level of vitamin C. The Tap de Cort√≠ is hygroscopic; this means that once is dry and even ground recovers some of the lost moisture absorbing it from the atmosphere.  Uses  Collection of paprika of Tap de Cort√≠. Two are the main uses of Tap de Cort√≠, on the one hand paprika Tap de Cort√≠ is typical in the traditional Balearic Islands recipes as a seasoning, mainly in stews but also in Majorcan dishes like bullit, arr√≤s brut, various soups, tombet, snails, frito Mallorqu√≠n, etc. On the other hand, paprika Tap de Cort√≠ is used as a preservative for the Majorcan sobrassada (is a raw, cured sausage from the Balearic Islands made with ground pork, paprika and salt and other spices), providing that characteristic red colour and deep aroma. Before Christopher Columbus brought sweet paprika from South America the sobrassada was white and with early expiration, but thanks to the Paprika antioxidant properties it could keep up to a year if carefully cured in a fresh place. This fact made changed sobrassada from luxury product, consumable only within the first few months regarding its preparation, to a daily consumer product. The high number of tourism in the Balearic Islands has led to open both national and internationals restaurants increasing the culinary offer in the islands, this has made paprika Tap de Cort√≠ be used in a large quantity national dishes: Galician octopus (Pulpo a feira), Avila patatoes (patatas revolconas) or Madrid boiled (Cocido Madrile√±o), as well as international dishes such as the famous Hungarian goulash.  Nutrition and health  Tap de Cort√≠ contains mostly water, carbohydrates and fiber, while low fat and protein. Its main contribution is found in the large amount of vitamin C - it contains almost double that of orange or kiwi - a large portion of vitamin A and carotenoids, which give its characteristic red colour while providing Vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin K and in a lesser extent Vitamin B. Among the minerals, the paprika Tap de Cort√≠ supplies calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium. It also has a wealth of non-nutrient compounds, such as the polyphenols, which give it strong antioxidant power, and lycopene (which is also found in tomatoes), with strong anticancer action. In addition, Capsiate Capsicum extract is obtained from Tap de Cort√≠, which contains spicy substances (capsinoids), with the ability to increase the metabolism, thus increasing energy consumption and diminishing accumulation of fat in the body.  Conservation and care  Paprika of Tap de Cort√≠ To get the best yield, the paprika Tap de Cort√≠ should be consumed within the first two years of life. During this period the aroma, taste and colour reflect the highest quality, after this time lose its properties. If instead is used to make sobrassada, has to be noted that paprika Tap de Cort√≠ over a year is not advisable as it doesn't have the same qualities organoleptics. Do not to forget that, in addition to taste and aroma, Tap de Cort√≠ has an important role in the correct ripe of sobrassada from a physiochemical point of view.

Plot The People of Forever Are Not Afraid tells the story of three young Israeli women - Lea, Avishag and Yael - following them from their high school years in a small northern village, through their enlistment in the Israeli Defence Force where they train marksmen, guard a border and man a checkpoint, and on to their twenties. The book describes the progress of the three women in a series of vignettes. Reviews In the United States, the Wall Street Journal said the book is ‚Äúa dark, riveting window into the mind-state of Israel's younger generation‚Ä¶[and] ‚Ä¶marks the arrival of a brilliant writer,‚Äù and cited the ‚Äúcandid, convincing psychological profiles of the three heroines.‚Äù LA Review of Books called it a ‚Äúbeautifully rendered account of the absurdities and pathos inherent to everyday life in Israel.‚Äù\\"Words Are Not Enough: A Novel of Life in Israel,\\" LA Review of Books. The Washington Post said the prose ‚Äúhas a flat, harsh glare that can seem benumbing at first but evokes the deadening that comes of constant war.‚Äù\\"Book World: ‚ÄòThe People of Forever Are Not Afraid‚Äô is a stark portrait of constant war,\\" The Washington Post. NPR said the novel has ‚Äúappealing main characters‚Äù and ‚Äúrefreshing frankness‚Äù but that there is ‚Äúnot much war‚Äù in the book, ‚Äújust small doses of bad behavior on both sides of the line, and nearly 350 pages of frank and episodic scenes about female life in the IDF, which by midway through the book begin to lose their charm.‚Äù\\" 'The People of Forever are Frank but Flawed,\\" NPR. The Washington Independent Review of Books said the book is ‚Äúengaging and revealing ‚Ä¶ a fascinating look at Israeli army life‚Äù but that its ‚Äúawkward structure‚Äù and first-person voices made it ‚Äúhard to follow the chain of events,‚Äù so ‚Äúthe stories and anecdotes never quite come together in a unified whole.‚Äù\\"The People of Forever Are Not Afraid ,\\" Washington Independent Review of Books. The Examiner found Boianjiu's ‚Äúflat‚Äù characters to be authentic and said the author forced the critic \\"to breathe, think, and feel the pain of her characters and her enemies,‚Äù and that the book ‚Äúwas validly realistic. The style suited the age of the characters and their situation.‚Äù\\"Shani Boianjiu‚Äôs war treatise: The People of Forever are Not Afraid,\\" examiner.com. Jewish Ideas Daily said the author's unique use of the English language, ‚Äúput her solidly within the modern Jewish tradition of transnational and multilingual literature.\\"\\"Shani Boianjiu and the Past and Present of Jewish Literature,\\" Jewish Ideas Daily. The New York Times said that \\"though it‚Äôs called a novel, it‚Äôs really a bracing collection of linked stories,\\" and that the author's ‚Äúvoice is distinct. It‚Äôs confident, raw, amusing ‚Äî a lot like her women.\\"\\"New Books by Shani Boianjiu, Michael Sears and More ,\\" The New York Times. The New Republic said the novel is \\"carefully wrought, consciously structured [and] creatively imagined.\\"\\"Voices of Their Generations? An Israeli Novelist Shows That Lena Dunham May Have Something To Say,\\" The New Republic. In the United Kingdom, The Daily Telegraph said the book was ‚Äúa memorably bold novel‚Ä¶ Boianjiu has created a brave, beautiful political literature that is entirely her own.‚Äù The Sunday Times said the book was an ‚Äúimpressive first novel... In a humorous, restrained and beguiling deadpan,‚Äù the book delivers ‚Äúa rare insight into the boredom, fear and thrills of young Israelis being minced through military service.‚Äù The Observer said that ‚Äúthe author successfully finds a voice to express the dehumanising horror of warfare in this fragmented plot held together with a passionate, poetic eloquence.‚Äù The Guardian said the novel's prose, initially ‚Äúseems charmingly stilted, but soon ‚Ä¶ starts to grate like a bad translation,‚Äù and that it ‚Äúcaptures well the dissonance of a transition into womanhood that must take place within the fear-soaked tedium of compulsory military service‚Ä¶but ‚Ä¶the narrative feels more like a succession of vignettes.‚Äù The Economist described the novel as a ‚ÄúBildungsroman‚Äù and said that in it ‚Äúlife in the army initiates a metamorphosis from girl to woman‚Ä¶Boianjiu‚Äôs depiction of‚Ä¶the psyches of these young women is fascinating‚Ä¶ The prose [reads] alternately like a nightmare and a dream, but this feverish indecision is what gives it its power.‚Äù The Financial Times said ‚ÄúThe corrosive effects of existing on [the] continual knife-edge of boredom and horror are charted in a prose style that is, by turns, sharply comic, lyrically beautiful and chillingly flat ‚Ä¶ The People of Forever is a modern anthem for doomed youth, a brilliant anatomisation of the yearning for normality in a situation that renders it impossible ... If you still need convincing, read this book.‚Äù In Canada, the Winnipeg Free Press said the novel \\"is intelligent, disconcerting and powerful... Boianjiu tells it like it is, and in the telling conveys the emotional toll taken on young lives when they are raised in a nascent country where politics, cultures, faiths and histories clash, and borders are always just a stone's throw away.‚Äù The Calgary Herald wrote ‚Äúthe book is a remarkably frank, funny, cynical and ultimately sad portrayal of young Israelis, both in and out of military service.‚Äù The Canadian Jewish News said, ‚ÄúPowerful, touching stuff‚Ä¶ Boianjiu is an exciting, youthful writer, not afraid to take on heavy themes.‚Äù\\"A dark, cynical look at life in the army ,\\" Canadian Jewish News. Chatelaine said that ‚ÄúBoianjiu‚Äôs voice is light, believable and addictive, perfectly contrasting her bubbly teenage characters against the dark moments they go through... This novel is like taking a roller-coaster ride.‚Äù\\"A riveting story of girls coming of age in the military ,\\" Chatelaine. In Germany, the prominent feminist Alice Schwarzer wrote in Emma, ‚Äúthe tone is rough, cool, funny and heartbreaking, despite or because of the unending tragedy ‚Ä¶ The book is a harrowing voice against the war.\\" S√ºddeutsche Zeitung called it ‚Äúa very good book ‚Ä¶ gripping, cocky and authentic‚Äù.\\"Das Volk der Ewigkeit kennt keine Angst ,\\" Perlentaucher. Badische Zeitung said the book ‚Äúis a strong anti-war novel, and can be compared with large genre classics such as Joseph Heller's Catch-22.‚Äù In the Netherlands, VPRO Magazine said it was ‚Äúa remarkable debut. Boianjiu conjures a harrowing image of the army ‚Äì an inert and brooding image: the heat, the boredom, the humiliations, the loneliness and the fear. But at the same time the tone of voice is breezy and darkly humorous.‚Äù Boek Magazine said ‚ÄúShani Boianjiu is a more than welcome, necessary new voice in literature who, with her first novel, delivered a fine, bold, painful and moving book. Remember her name.‚Äù In Belgium Knack Focus called it ‚Äúa brilliant novel in which despair, irony and sexuality power a new generation of women.‚Äù\\"Het eeuwige volk kent geen angst ,\\" Ambo Anthos. In Hungary, Gittegylet said about the author: ‚ÄúA young and extremely talented first-time author holds a mirror up to the reader, and cheekily asks the question: What is good? What is wrong? Who is right? Who is wrong? ‚Ä¶Boianjiu‚Äôs novel is both overwhelming and fun. Life in it is not a joke, not for kids, but sometimes it's hilarious, yet at the same time there is always a kid who is dying, and the weird thing is, the kid is someone you could have been. I do not like it that this is so, but so it goes‚Ä¶An excellent novel by a great writer.‚Äù Holdkatlan said that ‚ÄúBoianjiu‚Äôs very lyrical text is out of control, and the reader can almost wander through the captivating prose‚Äôs emotions as if they were music, or popular videos‚Ä¶The polyphonic narrative, beautifully dispatched by the different points of view at different years in the army, and even the language enable you to trace the development of the personality of the girls, their thought, and their physical process of growing up.‚Äù. In Sweden, GP said the book was ‚Äúan exhausting but also very touching and informative read, not least for the language's sake. Boianjiu knows how to use it to portray both darkness and light.‚Äù\\"Shani Boianjiu Det eviga folket √§r inte r√§dda,\\" GP. Corren said ‚Äúthis is an important book for those who want to familiarize themselves with how it is to live, especially as a young woman in today's Israel. Teenage boredom, trials, lack of confidence, are portrayed with a strong, intense language and a voice like no other. However, the book as a novel, is not particularly coherent. Time, space and perspective shift a bit too often, and the text becomes feverish - and just as in a fever dream, it becomes difficult to know what really happens in real life.‚Äù\\"Shani Boianjiu: Det eviga folket √§r inte r√§dda ,\\" Corren. Sveriges Radio said ‚Äúeven though a soldier‚Äôs life is monotonous and boredom takes up a good part of the text, it is often a fun book. Boianjiu portrays zealous army regulations in a way that is reminiscent of Joseph Heller's Catch 22.\\"\\"Shani Boianjiu: \\"Det eviga folket √§r inte r√§dda,\\" Sveriges Radio. In Portugal, Di√°rio Digital called Boianjiu a ‚Äúsmall genius ‚Ä¶ an inexhaustible source of energy.‚Äù Time Out Lisbon said she was an ‚ÄúIsraeli hurricane‚Äù, and that the book's stories were ‚Äúall united by ‚Ä¶ urgency, a pace that takes the reader from start to finish.‚Äù RUADEBAIXO said that \\"we may feel close to the protagonists, but we will never be able to understand the feelings of those girls. This story, as much or more than it is the story of young women who have been put to the test by imminent war and a world dominated by men, is also a story about time. How time heals and changes ... So much and so little changes in two years. It all depends on how we choose to spend them.\\"\\"The People of Forever Are Not Afraid - Shani Boianjiu,\\" RUADEBAIXO.com. In Spain, El Imparcial said the book was \\"a brave, fierce and politically incorrect testimony of Israeli youth ... fictional or real stories of the past ‚Ä¶ give the book a very light and pleasant pace, with many jumps in time and space ... told with genuine suspense and almost like a movie. The author reveals an amazing ability to get into the atrocities of the war with extreme harshness ... promising writer who undoubtedly awaits many years of career ahead.‚Äù\\"Shani Boianjiu: La gente como nosotros no tiene miedo ,\\" El Imparcial. En Femenino, which picked the book as one of its ten not-be-missed books of fall 2013, said it is ‚Äúa provocative story about girl soldiers of Israel ‚Ä¶ Ultimately, this is an intelligent story that shows the unknown reality of some women who are forced to choose a destiny.‚Äù\\"10 libros que no te puedes perder este oto√±o ,\\" En Feminino. Revista Kritica called the book ‚Äúa novel in which there is no unnecessary idealism, glory or heroism. Boianjiu presents the situation in her country and the army in total rawness, without masking the reality and beauty. A very faithful portrait.‚Äù\\"La gente como nosotros no tiene miedo de Shani Boianjiu,\\" Revista Kritica. In Brazil, Revista Brasileiros said \\"between the lines, Shani draws up a treaty of a whole generation‚Äôs aspirations and the troubled, unpromising future that lies ahead. Her girls figure out that to get out alive they must mature, and fast. When they see each other, they talk about their crushes, make fun of the rules, and try to escape from the boring routine, always under the pressure of their superiors. And just like that, a dark world, little by little, closes in on them ... It‚Äôs an impressive story, showing the damages caused by war without resorting to ideological arguments or demonizing the enemy.\\"\\"Maturidade for√ßada,\\" Revista Brasileiros, 1/5/13. Correio Braziliense said \\"with a bittersweet tone ‚Ä¶ [it is] a narrative stitched with wit and humor.\\"\\"O olhar feminino diante da insensatez,\\" Correio Braziliense. Brazilian Rolling Stone said \\"the story ... is told so bravely and with such talent by the author - that it reveals the characters, who sound like typical teenagers full of regrets, to be true heroes of an epic journey.\\"\\"Guia de Livros - O Povo Eterno N√£o Tem Medo,\\" Rolling Stone Brasil. In the Czech Republic, iFORUM said it was \\"an intimate, must-read account of women in the army; a matrix of conflict, danger, hierarchy, politics, sexism and unapologetic reality, dramatically contrasted with relatable, approachable themes of womanhood. Illuminated with the cutting, witty personality and deeply personal experiences of Boianjiu.\\"\\"Faculty of Humanities Introduces a Debut Author with Revolutionary Words,\\" iFORUM. IHNED said that \\"at nearly three hundred and fifty pages of prose scrambles war drama with a girl novel ... It has a sharp style, a surprising distinctive view of the situation, which is usually difficult or even tragic.\\"\\"Jsou mlad√©, kr√°sn√© a ozbrojen√©. Izraelsk√° spisovatelka ost≈ôe l√≠ƒç√≠ slu≈æbu u arm√°dy,\\" IHNED.cz. Literarni Koutek said that \\"although the book deals with the serious issue of war and death in the army ... it is not a depressing, but a very interesting reading ... a breathtaking novel that becomes great.‚Äù\\"Recenze: Vƒõƒçn√Ω n√°rod se strachy net≈ôese - ≈†ani Boianjiu,\\" Literarni Koutek. In Italy, Lundici said it was \\"an unusual book, a valuable testimony... The language is simple, fresh and dismissive of young people, often paradoxical and streaked with nonsense, in which the narrative voices alternate, today and yesterday take turns ... Sometimes [the girls] are afraid, but at the same time, they are courageous in facing the dangers and know how to laugh at their own weaknesses.\\" TGCOM said, \\"forget Amos Oz, Grossman and Yehoshua. Shani Boianjiu remembers more than Yizhar, the writer who 60 years ago described the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian villages of the soldiers of Israel. Boianjiu give voice to girls scared and arrogant ... able to surprise you with moments of their delusions and paranoia, and also with moments of their independence.\\" SoloLibri said the book was \\"a repeated punch in the stomach...There is no lack of irony in the novel's moments. Joy and love always remain in the mouth, but so does the bitterness of knowing that the meeting with those teenagers was not just a feeling but the truth.‚Äù In Serbia, Domino said it was an \\"exquisite and moving drama about the life of women in Israel ... Although the novel's subject matter is serious and difficult, it was written with a lot of irony and humor.\\" In Poland, Uwazam Rze wrote that the book has \\"moving themes of friendship, sex, violence, family, nationalism, war and trauma. Boianjiu has a unique voice ... For the Polish reader there may be a lesson: let us rejoice that we live in a country without compulsory military service. And let us be grateful to those who serve voluntarily.\\"\\"Women in Uniform,\\" Uwazam Rze. In Iceland, Sp√°ss√≠an wrote that the book is ‚Äúa collection of events, a holistic, flowing narrative. The story has a beginning and an end, and the narrative seems to be more or less in chronological order. Shani, however, chooses rather to focus on individual events and describe them in great detail, rather than trying to describe life in the military in general terms ‚Ä¶ focusing on the human side of the conflict by allowing us to get to know the characters on both sides of the line ... but in the end, the reader is left with a bad taste in the mouth about the reality of young people living in the area.‚Äù\\"Leiki√∞ me√∞ √æungavopn ,\\" Sp√°ss√≠an. In France, Elle wrote that \\"Shani Boianjiu delivers a remarkable novel... Delirious dreamlike delusions, little tricks between colonies, kibbutz and check-point, broken friends, remorse, excesses, exactions, hobbies under the watchtowers and full of sand, there is all this in this generational and desperate, spasmodic and tragic novel\\" In Israel, Haaretz wrote that the book \\"may be dark and grim, but does not in any way lack humor. Shani Boianjiu is a very funny writer, and she places her characters in some drolly amusing situations ... What gives Boianjiu‚Äôs work an extra jolt is that every so often, without warning, she crosses the line delimiting reality to present a surreal, often grotesque vision. We know that it can‚Äôt be real, but we aren‚Äôt sure just when the line was crossed. Suddenly, though, there‚Äôs a feeling of the oxygen having been sucked from the room.\\"\\"A kingdom of children in a dystopian Israel ,\\" Haaretz. Ynet said that \\"[Boianjiu] wrote a moving novel, in English, for Americans who don't know the details and horrors of the reality of life here, and she did that with a clear and uncompromising voice that forces the Israeli reader to look at that reality, that oftentimes he might want to deny and repress, at least through a literary work. There's nowhere to escape to in this book, because the comic moments get broken to pieces and collected back together by the hand of an artist. One can only be saddened by the content, admire the achievement and enjoy the realistic-absurdity of it.\\"\\"Brought the IDF to the Americans: Shani Boainjiu's Novel,\\" Ynet. Awards and recognition Boianjiu was the first Israeli author to be longlisted for the UK's Women's Prize for Fiction, and the youngest nominee that year (2013).\\"Israel's Shani Boianjiu in the running for top U.K. book award,\\" Haaretz.

It was officially created in 194 AD and after c. 400. Phoenice Syria was divided into Phoenice proper or Phoenice Paralia, and Phoenice Libanensis, a division that persisted until the region was conquered by the Muslim Arabs in the 630s.  Administrative history  Map of the Diocese of the East with its provinces, as recorded in the Notitia Dignitatum, c. 400 Phoenicia came under the rule of the Roman Republic in 64 BC, when Pompey created the province of Syria. With the exception of a brief period in 36‚Äì30 BC, when Mark Antony gave the region to Ptolemaic Egypt, Phoenicia remained part of the province of Syria thereafter. Emperor Hadrian (reigned 117‚Äì138) is said to have considered a division of the overly large Syrian province in 123/124 AD, but it was not until shortly after c. 194 AD that Septimius Severus (r. 193‚Äì211) actually undertook this, dividing the province into Syria Coele in the north and Syria Phoenice in the south. Tyre became the capital of the new province, but Elagabalus (r. 218‚Äì222) raised his native Emesa to co-capital, and the two cities rivaled each other as the head of the province until its division in the 4th century. Diocletian (r. 284‚Äì305) separated the district of Batanaea and gave it to Arabia, while sometime before 328, when it is mentioned in the Laterculus Veronensis, Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337) created the new province of Augusta Libanensis out of the eastern half of the old province, encompassing the territory east of Mount Lebanon. Phoenice I & Phoenice Libanensis Constantine's province was short-lived, but formed the basis of the re-division of Phoenice c. 400 into the Phoenice I or Phoenice Paralia (, \\"coastal Phoenice\\"), and Phoenice II or Phoenice Libanensis (Œ¶ŒøŒπŒΩŒØŒ∫Œ∑ ŒõŒπŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒ∑œÉŒØŒ±), with Tyre and Emesa as their respective capitals. In the Notitia Dignitatum, written shortly after the division, Phoenice I is governed by a consularis, while Libanensis is governed by a praeses, with both provinces under the Diocese of the East.Notitia Dignitatum, in partibus Orientis, I This division remained intact until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s. Under the Caliphate, most of the two Phoenices came under the province of Damascus, with parts in the south and north going to the provinces of Jordan and Emesa respectively.  Ecclesiastical administration  The ecclesiastical administration paralleled the political, but with some differences. The bishop of Tyre emerged as the pre-eminent prelate of Phoenice by the mid-3rd century. When the province was divided c. 400, Damascus, rather than Emesa, became the metropolis of Phoenice II. Both provinces belonged to the Patriarchate of Antioch, with Damascus initially outranking Tyre, whose position was also briefly challenged by the see of Berytus c. 450; after 480/1, however, the Metropolitan of Tyre established himself as the first in precedence (protothronos) of all the Metropolitans subject to Antioch.

They are relatively large ghost crabs, with a carapace growing up to long and wide. They are easily recognisable by their golden yellow colouration. Like other ghost crabs they have box-like bodies with unequally sized claws. They also have large eyestalks with the cornea occupying most of the bottom part. Golden ghost crabs are common inhabitants of open sandy beaches, living in burrows in the intertidal and supratidal zones. They are predominantly nocturnal and semi- terrestrial. They are a generalist species, feeding on carrion and debris, as well as preying on small animals. Along with the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), they are significant as one of the main predators of eggs and hatchlings of Western Australian sea turtles, particularly the Endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) which has one of the largest rookeries in the region. Classification Ocypode convexa is classified under the genus Ocypode in the ghost crab subfamily Ocypodinae of the family Ocypodidae. It was first described by the French naturalists Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1824 as Ocypode convexus.The specific name has been emended to Ocypode convexa because the grammatical gender of the genus Ocypode is feminine. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature requires gender agreement between the specific name and the generic name. The type specimens were recovered from Dirk Hartog Island, Shark Bay, Western Australia, during the circumnavigational voyage of the French corvettes Uranie and Physicienne (1817‚Äì1820) under the command of Louis de Freycinet. Etymology While the specific name is derived from Latin convexus (\\"vaulted\\" or \\"domed\\"). The latter is a direct translation of Quoy and Gaimard's \\"French name\\" of the species, Ocypode bomb√©, referring to the dome-like shape of the carapace. They are commonly known as the \\"golden ghost crab\\". They are also sometimes referred to as the \\"western ghost crab\\", or the \\"yellow ghost crab\\". Taxonomic history The species was more widely known in scientific literature by its junior synonym Ocypode pygoides in the early 20th century due to the uncertainty regarding the original descriptions and illustrations by Quoy and Gaimard. Jean Ren√© Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard's original 1824 illustration of Ocypode convexa In 1837, the French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards used Quoy and Gaimard's French \\"translation\\" of the name, Ocypode bomb√© (writing it as Ocypode bomb√©e), instead of the Latin name, Ocypode convexus. However, he also declared that the species \\"hadn't been described or illustrated in enough detail for it to be recognised in some way\\".French:\\"... n'a pas √©t√© d√©crite ni figur√©e avec assez de d√©tail pour pouvoir √™tre reconnue d'une mani√®re certaine.\\" The British zoologist Edward J. Miers also regarded it as a possible synonym of either Ocypode kuhlii or Ocypode cordimanus in 1882, again due to the vagueness of the original descriptions. In 1894, the Prussian-American zoologist Arnold Edward Ortmann described Ocypode pygoides without consulting Quoy and Gaimard's original work. Although he did posit the possibility that Ocypode pygoides and Ocypode convexa might actually be the same species later on in 1897.German: \\"Nach der Localit√§t und dem Habitusbild w√§re es m√∂glich, dass diese Art dieselbe ist wie pygoides. Beschreibung und Abbildung geben aber keine Einzelheiten, die dies gewiss machen k√∂nnten.\\" (English: \\"After the locality and habitus image, it is possible that this species is the same as pygoides. But the descriptions and illustrations do not provide any details that could make this certain.\\") In 1957, due to the discovery of a name conflict with an unrelated crab species also originally described as Ocypode convexusAs Ocypode (Chasmagnathus) convexus, now valid as Chasmagnathus convexus by the Dutch zoologist Wilhem de Haan in 1833, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) suppressed Quoy and Gaimard's Ocypode convexus. This ruling was made on the basis that the consulted specialists regarded Quoy and Gaimard's Ocypode convexus as nomen dubium. It wasn't until 1965 when the Australian carcinologists Ray W. George and Mary E. Knott finally clarified the confusion surrounding the name by demonstrating that Ocypode pygoides and Ocypode convexa were identical and formally synonymised the former with the latter. The name Ocypode convexa is now regarded as the valid name and the species has been referred to as such in subsequent publications. Ocypode stimsponii, a different species found in East Asia, was also initially described by the American zoologist William Stimpson as Ocypode convexa in 1858. Like de Haan, Stimpson was unaware that the name had already been used previously by Quoy and Gaimard. Ortmann realised that Stimpson's name for the species was a junior homonym in 1897 and renamed the species Ocypode stimpsonii. Ocypode nobilii, another species from Southeast Asia, was also mistakenly identified as Ocypode convexa on its discovery in 1899 by the Italian carcinologist Giuseppe Nobili. In 1902, the Dutch biologist Johannes Govertus de Man recognised that it was actually a new species and named it Ocypode nobilii in honour of Nobili. Description Golden ghost crabs are relatively large and robust ghost crabs with strong legs and claws. Their carapace is deep and box- like in shape, and can grow to a length of up to and a width of . They are easily identifiable by their colouration. As their common name implies, the overall colour of golden ghost crabs is usually creamy white to a rich golden yellow with faint brown markings. Ocypode convexa eyestalks and anterior profile of the carapace (top); and the stridulating ridge (a row of 19 to 24 tubercles) on the larger claw (bottom). Like other ghost crabs, the eyestalks of golden ghost crabs are large and swollen, with the cornea occupying the lower surface. Their tips do not extend into a spike (style) making them easy to distinguish from the similarly-sized horned ghost crab (Ocypode ceratophthalma) which also occurs in Western Australia. The upper margins of the eye orbits curve around the bases of the eyestalks, then gently curve again towards the sides of the carapace. The outer edges of the upper margins of the eye orbits are triangular in shape and distinctly pointing forward. The lower margins of the eye orbits have deep notches on the center and on the sides. The carapace is wider than it is long, being broadest at the width between the outer edges of the eye orbits. The upper surface is covered densely with small bumps (tubercles) that gradually become sparser towards the anterolateral regions. The carapace bulges outward on the outer thirds and is separated from the central regions by shallow furrows. As in other members of the family Ocypodidae, one of the claw appendages (chelipeds) of golden ghost crabs is much larger than the other. This occurs in both males and females, though the difference is much more pronounced in males. The palm (propodus)The second to the last segment of crustacean appendages of both larger and smaller chelipeds are covered coarsely with large irregularly-arranged tubercles on the outer surface, giving them a rough appearance. The larger claw is longer than it is wide, with its upper and lower edges possessing rows of spine-like tubercles, arranged irregularly on the upper margin and regularly on the lower margin. The inner surface of the palm of the larger claw in both sexes features stridulating (sound-producing) ridges, which is important for identifying different species within the subfamily Ocypodinae. In golden ghost crabs, the stridulating ridge is composed of a row of 19 to 24 tubercles. The smaller cheliped tapers towards a pointed end. Golden ghost crabs eating a dead octopus The propodi of the first and second pair of walking legs possess bristles (setae) on the upper surfaces and the upper margins, while the propodi of the third and fourth pair of walking legs are naked. The first gonopod (appendages modified into sexual organs) of the male is three-sided in cross-section at the base, narrowing towards a sideways-curving tip. A bulging palp is present at the sides near the tip. The rim of the genital opening in females is horn-shaped and located in front of the genital covering (operculum). The operculum is rounded in shape. Ecology and behaviour Like other ghost crabs, golden ghost crabs are predominantly nocturnal, though they may sometimes emerge during the day. They are semi-terrestrial and breathe oxygen from the air through moistened gills. They must periodically wet their gills with seawater, usually by taking water from moist sand or by running into the surf and letting the waves wash over them. However, in 1962, the Australian zoologist William Ride reported golden ghost crabs foraging inland as far as away from the sea following heavy rains. This indicates that they are able to tolerate freshwater, and can still breathe by taking in moisture through wet vegetation. Golden ghost crabs must return to the sea to release their eggs. They hatch into marine planktonic larvae. Golden ghost crabs live in deep burrows in the intertidal and supratidal zones of open sandy beaches. Some burrows may be found as much as away from the high water mark and in the dune zone, but they are densest in the intertidal zone (71%). The burrows are vertically constructed, with the bottom commonly situated south of the entrance. It is believed that this is to prevent sunlight from shining into the burrow during the day. A golden ghost crab preying on a loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) hatchling at Gnaraloo, Western Australia They are swift runners, darting away to their burrows at the slightest sign of danger. In the presence of potential threats (like humans), golden ghost crabs have been observed to only raise one eyestalk at a time, keeping the other one protected within its eye orbit. This may be to avoid having both eyes damaged in case of an attack. Golden ghost crabs are a generalist species. They scavenge carrion and debris like dead fish or seaweed washed up by the waves; as well as prey on small animals like molluscs, other crustaceans, and sea turtle hatchlings. Effects on sea turtle conservation The Western Australian coast is the site of a significant number of rookeries of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), and hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), all of which are classified Endangered to Critically Endangered. The nesting sites are particularly numerous for loggerhead sea turtles, whose rookeries from Shark Bay to Gnaraloo Bay, Ningaloo Reef, and the Cape Range National Park are some of the largest in the world. Along with the introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes), golden ghost crabs are significant as one of the main predators of sea turtle eggs and hatchlings in these regions. A golden ghost crab on a marked sea turtle nest In the Gnaraloo Bay Rookery, where red fox populations have largely been kept in check, sea turtle eggs and hatchlings are mostly preyed upon by golden ghost crabs and, to a lesser extent, horned ghost crabs. Aside from directly preying on emerging hatchlings heading towards the water, there are also indications that golden ghost crabs actively burrow into nesting sites and feed on turtle eggs. In a 2010 assessment by the Gnaraloo Turtle Conservation Program, golden ghost crabs were found to be responsible for the most number of sea turtle egg and hatchling predation. Golden ghost crabs disturbed 38% and 46.7% of the egg chambers in the total number of nests within the study area during day and night studies respectively. They were also recorded to be responsible for the predation of 12% of the total number of hatchlings that emerged. In comparison, red foxes were responsible for only 6.51% (day) and 9.5% (night) of nest disturbances, and only 0.3% of hatchling predation. During the peak nesting season in 2010 to 2011, golden ghost crabs were also recorded to have disturbed 35%Disturbed nests refer to ghost crab burrows being found in nests but with no evidence of egg mortality visible from the surface. They may not necessarily indicate predation as some nests with ghost crab burrows were still observed to successfully hatch of the nests and to have actively preyed upon another 38%,Nest predation refers to ghost crab burrows being found in nests with clear evidence of egg mortality visible from the surface such as egg fragments, yolk, or an exposed egg chamber for a cumulative 73% of the nests affected. Areas with higher numbers of turtle nests also had higher numbers of ghost crabs, indicating a possible positive correlation between the two. The ghost crab population was highest during the summer seasons, and it is hypothesised that this might be because of greater food availability, as the summer tides leave a greater amount of debris on the beaches. However, gauging the true extent of the effects of golden ghost crabs on sea turtle hatchling and egg mortality still remains difficult, largely due to the fact that they usually flee at the presence of human observers and thus skew the data. Nest monitoring with night vision cameras has been proposed as a possible means of acquiring a more accurate assessment. Some methods for protecting the nests against golden ghost crabs have been proposed for trial in Gnaraloo. These include wire or plastic screens placed over the nests and continued human presence to discourage predators. Distribution Ocypode ceratophthalma) Golden ghost crabs are endemic to the coast of Western Australia, from Broome to Perth. They are one of five ghost crab species found in the Western Australian coast, the others being Ocypode ceratophthalma, Ocypode cordimanus, Ocypode fabricii, and Ocypode pallidula. Among these, Ocypode fabricii is also endemic to Australia (from Darwin to Shark Bay). Golden ghost crabs can easily be distinguished from all other species by their large size, their golden yellow colouration, and the rough tuberculation on their claws. The only similarly sized species in the region is the horned ghost crab, which are also easily distinguishable as they are the only ghost crab in Australia exhibiting spikes (exophthalmy) on the tips of their eyestalks. Younger individuals may be identified through the examination of their stridulating ridges and the shape of their gonopods. Conservation Due to the limited range of golden ghost crabs in Western Australia, they are deemed vulnerable to large scale environmental disasters that might affect the region (like oil spills). Like other ghost crabs, they are also strongly affected by human activity on their beach habitats, particularly by vehicles. In Western Australia, where driving off-road vehicles are common recreational activities by locals and tourists, ghost crabs are often crushed inside their burrows due to the weight of the passing vehicles. This is believed to contribute to their very low populations (up to 90% lower) in beaches near the urban areas in southern Australia. Golden ghost crabs, however, remain abundant in places with little to no human habitation, particularly in beaches with restricted vehicular access (such as the Gnaraloo Station).

The matter related to Native title rights, their extension to other persons and their extinguishment by Statute. Facts A group of Torres Strait Islanders, (the Claim Group) applied to the Federal Court seeking a determination that they had native title rights and interests in a major part of the sea area of Torres Strait, including a right to fish for sale and trade. This was opposed by the Commonwealth and Queensland State Governments who argued that, based on the decision in Western Australia v Ward,. that native title was a bundle of rights that were subservient to statute and that successive generations of fishing regulations over the subject waters from the 1850s, had required fishing licences and so had caused extinguishment of some of these native title rights specifically the right to fish for sale and trade. The Claim Group argued that it was never the intention of the Government to extinguish native title. They argued that fishing licensing did not prohibit but merely regulated commercial fishing. Indeed, a number of government schemes had been enacted to assist Torres Strait Islanders in setting up fishing enterprises. Finn J held that the Claim Group had for the most part, established their native title.. The Commonwealth appealed to a Full Court of the Federal Court. A majority, Keane CJ and Dowsett J, allowed part of the appeal, holding that the native title rights did not include the right to fish for sale or trade. Mansfield J dissented.. The Claim Group appealed to the High Court of Australia. Judgment In a unanimous decision handed down in two judgments the High Court found for the Claim Group. Taking a lead from cases like Yanner v Eaton,Yanner v Eaton ; 201 CLR 351. and the Commonwealth v YarmirrCommonwealth of Australia v Yarmirr ; 208 CLR 1. the High Court held that The Commonwealth Fisheries Act 1952 and the Queensland Fisheries Act 1887, which both required licensing of fishing activates, did not extinguish the relationship of the people to the land nor extinguish the native title bundle of rights. The first of the two judgments, by French CJ and Crennan J held a test as that asked: * if the native title right being used cannot be exercised without abrogating the statutory right, ‚Äúthen by necessary implication, the statute extinguishes the existing right.\\"Akiba v Commonwealth ; 250 CLR 209 at [31] but also found that ‚Äúthat a particular use of a native title right can be restricted or prohibited by legislation without that right or interest itself being extinguished.Akiba v Commonwealth ; 250 CLR 209 at [26]. The second judgment handed down by Bell, Kiefel and Hayne JJ arrived at the same result as the primary Judgment, however, they posited that it was not the subjective thinking of the law makers (i.e. intending to extinguish native title rights) that was important but rather the issue of inconsistency between the statute and the native title rights. The test they asked was: * ‚Äúwhether the activity which constitutes the relevant incident of native title is consistent with competent legislation relating to that activity\\"Akiba v Commonwealtha ; 250 CLR 209 at [65]. In answering this the judgment found that there was a native title right to take fish. The purpose for taking the fish was not at issue, and that shift of focus, from right to activity, led to error in this matter by the lower court.Akiba v Commonwealth ; 250 CLR 209 at [67]. They also found that the statutes regulated but did not extinguish the Native title rights Extension of Native title rights A number of third parties bought a cross claim in this matter. These were people who had familial and clan relationship and hereditary trading relationships with the native title holders, and they were seeking recognition of their rights. The court rejected this cross claim noting that although these relationships under Islander law and culture were very real and strong these were ‚Äúreciprocal rights as rights of a personal character dependent upon status and not rights in relation to the waters‚Äù itself.Akiba v Commonwealth ; 250 CLR 209 at [45].

After EBERs 1 and 2, ebv-sisRNA-1 is the third most abundant EBV RNA generated during a highly oncogenic form of virus latency (latency III). Conservation of ebv-sisRNA sequence and secondary structure between EBV and other herpesviruses suggest shared functions in latent infection.  Background  The Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (EBV) infects as many as 95% of adults and is the infectious agent responsible for mononucleosis (\\"mono\\"). Infection with EBV results in lifelong. Latent infections are \\"dormant\\", meaning no active virions are produced, however the virus generates proteins and RNAs to modulate host-virus interactions that maintain latent infection. In ways yet to be fully determined, these interactions make EBV-infected B cells more prone to becoming cancerous (e.g. Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma). Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have a role in this process. Structured ncRNAs are of particular interest as they serve a wide array of functions, which are the focus of intensive efforts to characterize and archive in such projects as Rfam. A recent study of ncRNAs in EBV using bioinformatics and RNA-Seq identified multiple regions within its genome likely to contain functional RNAs. These regions included EBER-1 and -2, v-snoRNA1, and most of the known viral miRNAs. In addition to these known EBV ncRNAs, this analysis identified new RNAs, including two stable intronic sequence (sis)RNAs. Introns, typically are rapidly degraded in the cell, but can persist and accumulate to high abundance when they serve a functional role. Such sisRNAs have been found in Xenopus oocytes. Stable introns are also found in other herpesviruses, for example, the HHV Latency Associated Transcript, which plays important roles in the maintenance of virus latency. (Free full-text article: ) Figure 1. EBV latency III transcript showing location of EBV W repeat stable introns. Figure 2. Secondary structure of ebv- sisRNA-1 In EBV, sisRNAs are generated from a region known as the W repeats. This region is transcribed during a type of viral latency that is highly oncogenic (latency type III) and also in a rare type of latency (Wp-restricted latency) observed in ~15% of endemic Burkitt's lymphoma. Splicing of these W repeat transcripts produces a short intron and a long intron (Fig. 1), both of which accumulate to high abundance in EBV-infected human B cells. Indeed, ebv- sisRNA-1 is the third most abundantly produced EBV RNA after EBER1 and EBER2, which are highly expressed in EBV-infected cells., The presence of these RNAs in a pathogenic form of latency suggests roles in EBV-associated cancers.  ebv-sisRNA-1  The short W repeat intron, rather than being spliced and rapidly degraded, persists after splicing and is the third most abundant EBV- produced small ncRNA in latency III. Nucleotides 4 to 26 of ebv-sisRNA-1 form a short hairpin loop that presents a Uridine-rich sequence motif (a possible platform for protein interactions) into the loop. The remainder of the sequence is unlikely to form stable RNA structure. This unstructured stretch of sequence may be exposed to allow for interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins. The sisRNA sequence is ~100% conserved in EBV strains and homology extends to include other lymphocryptoviruses. The hairpin structure is also conserved and includes structure-preserving mutations in its stem.  ebv-sisRNA-2  Ebv-sisRNA-2 is generated from the long W repeat intron. Evidence of stable and conserved RNA structure covers ~40% of this RNA and one region can fold into a remarkably long (586 nt) and thermodynamically stable hairpin loop (Fig. 2). In addition to EBV strains, where the hairpin is ~100% conserved in sequence, this structure is also found in other lymphocrypoviruses. Despite high divergence of sequence between these homologous RNAs, the long hairpin structure is well conserved. This suggests that this RNA plays an important functional role in ebv-sisRNA-2. The size of ebv-sisRNA-2 (2,791 nt) more closely resembles that the HHV Latency Associated Transcript) and may perhaps play a similar role in the maintenance of virus latency. Figure 3.

She was the Romanian national champion six times before moving to the Netherlands in 1974. In the Netherlands she was the national champion in 1974 and the years 1976 to 1979. Her best worldwide rank among women was fifth. Early life Nicolau was born in Bucharest as the daughter of »òtefan S. Nicolau, a Romanian virology expert. She would herself study the Chinese language. She was introduced to chess at the age of six by one of her brothers, who taught her how to play. Chess career Nicolau won the Romanian Women's Chess Championship six times: 1960, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1965 and 1973. For Romania, Nicolau also participated in the Chess Olympiad. At the 17th Chess Olympiad (1966) and 20th Chess Olympiad (1972), she was a member of the women's team which won the silver medal. As an individual, she won silver at the Olympiads in 1963 and 1966 at the first board, and won bronze in 1972 at the second board. In 1974 she started playing for the Netherlands, after staying in the country following her participation in the Hoogovenstoernooi the same year. She was awarded permanent residency and later Dutch nationality when she married Kees van der Mije. Nicolau had earlier resided for several months in the Netherlands after a tournament; she lacked permission from the Romanian government to do so. In 1969 she wished to study at Leiden University; however, while completing formalities in Romania, she was not allowed to return to the Netherlands and was banned from playing international chess tournaments. Her ban was removed after pressure from FIDE president Max Euwe. However, she was forced to promise members of the Securitate secret police that she would return after playing international tournaments until 1974. The Hoogovenstournooi was the first tournament for which Nicolau did not have to promise to return, and she immediately chose to remain in the Netherlands. She won the Dutch Women's Chess Championship in 1974 and again from 1976 to 1979. She also competed at the Olympiads for the Netherlands, first on the women's team at the 22nd Chess Olympiad (1976), winning the bronze medal. In 1980 she quit playing professional chess. Her final appearance at the Olympiad was at the 28th Chess Olympiad (1988). At her peak, Van der Mije-Nicolau was the fifth-ranked woman player in the world, but was never able to show great results at the Women's World Chess Championship due to her nerves. After her third-place finish at the Interzonal tournament in Roosendaal in 1976, she was awarded the title of Woman Grandmaster. Personal life Van der Mije has said she was not fanatical enough to only spend her time on chess, as she also liked to read detective stories and visit museums. After her retirement, she was a weekly member of the Het Spaarne chess club in Haarlem, where she was club champion in 2007. She died from cardiac arrest on 14 October 2013 at the age of 73.

Situated on a slight rise southwest of Banff, it looks across to Banff Bay. Originally owned by the Currour family, it was purchased by the Ogilvies of Dunlugas in 1557 and became their main family seat. The Ogilvies were staunch Royalists, which resulted in the castle coming under attack from the Covenanters in 1640. George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff was murdered in 1713 and his body hidden inside the castle, which was then set on fire. The castle came under siege again in 1746, during the Jacobite rising of 1745‚Äì46. At the start of the 19th century, following the death of the 8th Lord Banff, the property was inherited by the Abercromby of Birkenbog family, who leased it to a tenant. It became uninhabited after 1836 and the structure deteriorated. Over the following century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure wind and water tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 after the death of Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building. Early history The castle's exact construction date is unknown, but it was some time in the early to mid 16th century, during the reign of either James IV or James V. Various spellings are used: Inch Druar (or Inchdruar as one word); Inchdruer; Inchdrewir; or Inchdrewr. Originally owned by the Curror (Currour) family, in 1557 it was purchased by Walter Ogilvy of Dunlugas (1509‚Äì58), and became the main family seat. James Currour was a notary in Banff and is linked with several of Dunlugas' contracts and witnessing leases. During the late 16th century the Dunlugas Ogilvies undertook re-furbishment and extension work, including the addition of courtyard buildings and a distinctive circular tower that incorporated the hall into its first storey. An act recording the lands in favour of George Ogilvy was ratified by King Charles I in late June 1633. George was the son of Walter Ogilvy, and an ardent Royalist and supporter of the king against the Covenanters. Inchdrewer Castle was left in ruins after being attacked by Covenanter forces led by General Robert Monro in 1640; another of the family properties, a town house, was also devastated. George Ogilvy was appointed a peer in 1642, becoming the first Lord Banff. George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff, inherited the property when his father, the 2nd Lord Banff, died on 10 September 1668. He was murdered in 1713 and the castle destroyed by fire; his body had been concealed inside. Restoration work was once more undertaken. The castle came under attack by troops led by the Duke of Cumberland in 1746 in the course of the Jacobite rebellion. Yet more restoration work was carried out during the later part of the century. When William Ogilvy, 8th Lord Banff, died on 4 June 1803, the estate was inherited by his sister Jean (sometimes named Jane), who had married George Abercromby (Abercrombie) of Birkenbog. Her son, Sir Robert Abercromby succeeded her. Sir Robert was appointed member of Parliament for the Banff constituency in 1812 but four years later claimed financial difficulties prevented him seeking re- election. In 1820 he asked George IV to allow the Banff peerage, which had become dormant or extinct when the 8th Lord Banff died, to continue by declaring his mother Baroness Banff, or granting him the title of Lord Banff, but the request was denied. The main residence of the Abercromby's was at Forglen House, Turriff. The castle was in a sufficient state of repair to be leased to tenants until 1836. MacGibbon and Ross refer to the castle as being in the ownership of Sir R. J. Abercromby of Birkenbog when writing about it in their architectural book published in 1887. The ground-floor plan given in the book shows two parts of the building as being \\"ruinous\\". The castle was abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century, and it soon became dilapidated. Later history alt=Plan showing the ruinous sections of Inchdrewer Castle in 1887 The castle was purchased by Count Robin Mirrlees in 1962 or 1963. Renovation work was possibly undertaken in 1965 by architect Oliver Hill, although his undated drawings may not have been fully implemented. After visiting the property in 1966, Nigel Tranter, author and historian, reported that work had begun on the structure but described it as a \\"ruinous shell of a house\\". Some structural restoration work was undertaken and the castle was slightly repaired, sufficient to have made it \\"wind and watertight\\" by 1971. But it was then abandoned again, and further deterioration occurred; it had been uninhabitable since 1836, and Mirlees never lived in it. Internally, only basic work was undertaken. Local residents believed the only time the interior was used during this period was when a ceremony was held to site a plaque commemorating the completion of external work in 1971. Historic Scotland designated Inchdrewer Castle a category A listed building in February 1972. The poor condition of the property was highlighted in a report expressing concern by the Scottish Civic Trust in 1999. Inspections by Aberdeenshire Council officials described it as \\"showing signs of a lack of maintenance\\" in February 2008, with all its windows broken. Further decline was noted in October 2010, and the castle was said to be \\"on the cusp of ruination\\". Further deterioration was noted when the castle was visited in December 2012. Mirlees died on 23 June 2012. Together with the title of \\"Baron of Inchdrewer\\" the castle ruins were put up for sale in April 2013, and purchased in November 2013 for about ¬£400,000 by Olga Roh, former Valentino and Versace model and owner of Rohmir. Roh had never been to Scotland and had not seen the castle before she bought it, but said she planned to restore it so it could be used for fashion shoots, as a film location, or as a residence. Other suggestions were used as a holiday destination for friends or a boutique hotel. Architecture Layout of the first floor of Inchdrewer Castle in 1887 Starting as a basic L-shaped tower built from tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was extended in a southerly direction by the addition of a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century. A staircase was inside the new tower and further structures were added to the south and north sides of the courtyard at this stage of the development. Replacement entrances were installed and the original first-floor doorway was closed off. Access on the west side was gained through a narrow round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was incorporated in the south elevation. Some of the architectural features incorporated throughout the castle included: corbelled battlemented wallheads on the towers; turrets set above first or second storey level; a large elongated aperture provided light in the first floor hall; and shot holes in the southwest tower. The fenestrations on the wing added in the late 18th century differed from those used in earlier parts of the structure, being larger and more regular in appearance. The restorations completed in 1971 made the structure wind and water tight, added extra windows and installed fresh glazing, but as it was then abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by vandalism led to further structural deterioration. The castle was in a ruinous condition in 2013 and unfit for habitation. Superstition and haunting Twenty-first century newspaper stories report that the ghost of the murdered George Ogilvy, 3rd Lord Banff, haunts the castle. Nigel Tranter visited Inchdrewer again in the 1970s and a large white dog, which he speculated may have been a Samoyed, bounded out of the castle as he approached it with a local builder. Unable to explain how the dog could have been confined in the castle for seven days, he was later sent a copy of the magazine Vogue, in which it was stated that the castle was \\"haunted by a lady in the shape of a white dog\\".

The tract addresses Milton's own problems with the doctrines, practices, and ceremonies associated with the pope or the papal system of the Roman Catholic Church and, with what Milton called, the implicit faith of its members. The anti-Catholic ideas in Milton's writing are in direct response to the tolerant stance of King Charles II of England toward the Roman Catholic Church. Pro-Catholic sentiments had not been popular in England since the very bloody reign of the devout Roman Catholic queen Mary I of England. The obvious anti-Catholic ideas present in Milton's writing, coupled with Milton's own influence, may have inspired such social movements as the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the eventual passing of the Popery Act of 1698.  Content  Milton accuses the Roman Catholic Church of blatantly changing scripture and of blindly leading gullible members astray. He argues that the Catholic Church's reliance on popery is false religion and uses that as evidence of heresy within the institution. Milton begins his argument with the claim that \\"the increase of popery is at this day no small trouble and offence to the greatest part of the nation.\\"John Milton, Protestant Union: A Treatise of True Religion, Heresy, Schism, Toleration, and what Best Means May be Used Against the Spread of Popery. Milton continues his argument by juxtaposing the supposed errors of the Catholic Church with his own definition of \\"true religion.\\" He maintains that true religion \\"is the true worship and service of God, learnt and believed from the word of God only.\\" Milton also suggests that members of the Roman Catholic Church live by a system of implicit faith. He proposes a solution to the problem, stating that two principles of true religion would \\"cut off many debates and contentions, schisms, and persecutions\\" between Christians.  Two Principles  In his tract, John Milton frequently cited Biblical passages as a way of providing substantial evidence against the Catholic Church. Milton quoted from the books of Deuteronomy (Deut. 4:2) and Revelation (Rev. 22:18,19) and argued that the two main principles of true religion were (1) the word of God only, and (2) \\"that faith ought not to be an implicit faith, that is to believe, though as the church believes, against or without express authority of scripture.\\"  Historical context  Milton wrote his pamphlet in 1673, one year before his eventual death. With his greatest works behind him, Milton could focus on his current state and the condition of his country. He had undoubtedly studied the consequences of a state-run church in EnglandGordon Campbell, ‚ÄòMilton, John (1608‚Äì1674)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2009 accessed 12 Nov 2013 and fully believed in the separation of the church from the state. Milton was a witness of the unpopularity of the tolerant attitude of King Charles II toward the Catholics. Charles II had promulgated the declaration of indulgence (which had suspended the penalties for Catholicism and nonconformity) in March 1672, but had been forced to rescind it in March 1673. \\"Milton's tract is tolerant of the sectarians, who ‚Äòmay have some errors, but are not heretics‚Äô, but mounts a vicious attack on Roman Catholicism, which he denounces as politically dangerous and theologically idolatrous.\\" Although his views and opinions did not receive much attention during his lifetime, they would later prove worthy influences of future parliamentary issues like the Popery Act of 1698. His writings later became wildly popular to the future revolutionary movements in France and America.

Education Cassaday did her BA, MA (Hons) in Experimental Psychology, at University College, University of Oxford (1986,1990); her PhD was in Psychopharmacology, at Institute of Psychiatry, University of London (1990) Research Her research is focused on investigating the underlying biology of associative learning processes, fundamental to normal cognition in animals and humans. Her research group investigates the underlying biology of associative learning processes, fundamental to normal cognition, in laboratory rats and mice. The animal learning theories can also be applied to our understanding of age-related cognitive decline, as well as to human diseases in which associative processes are disordered. When there is a time gap between events, we are less able to make a connection between them in learning and later memory. Thus it is harder to keep track of things that could in fact be causally related, in order - for example - to know that even distant engine noise can predict a future hazard or to anticipate dinner based on the smell of raw ingredients. The ability successfully to bridge a time gap between events is known to deteriorate with age in humans and other animals. This line of work (funded by the BBSRC) aims to identify the neural substrates of trace conditioning, and to compare these with those of delay-dependent forgetting measured in other procedures. In schizophrenia, her team finds that learning occurs inappropriately, about stimuli that would normally be treated as irrelevant, redundant or in some other way indistinct. This line of work (funded by the MRC and Wellcome Trust) has focused on the neural substrates of selective learning. Recent work compared the effects of localised treatments within nucleus accumbens on latent inhibition, based on past experience with the cue or ‚Äòacquired salience‚Äô, and cue competition through overshadowing, based on relative intensity of the cue or ‚Äòintrinsic salience‚Äô. To promote translation of these findings to our understanding of human disorder, a number of her graduate students (Ellen Migo, Ebrahim Kantini, Zhimin He, Meghan Thurston, Becci Gould) have also successfully established associative learning procedures suitable for use with human participants. In addition to projects on selective learning mechanisms and their dysfunction, she and her colleagues have shown the validity of a non-invasive objective measure of stress in laboratory mice (Ann Fitchett, BBSRC-funded studentship, welfare remit).

She was the widow of Thomas Pope, another Shrewsbury resident. The Ottley family were part of the landed gentry of Shropshire and claimed descent from the more ancient Ottleys of Oteley, near Ellesmere, Shropshire.Grazebrook and Rylands, p.380-381 However, Thomas Ottley, the ancestor who bought Pitchford Hall in 1473, was a Merchant of the StapleB.D.

Richard Ottley was born on 5 August 1626 and christened on 15 September.Horton, p.13 He had a brother, Adam, who was born in 1628 and a sister, Mary, who was born in 1630. He was admitted to Shrewsbury School on 9 April 1638, the same day as his brother Adam.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.234. but his education beyond that stage was interrupted by the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642. The Civil War and Commonwealth Francis Ottley was quick to act to disrupt Parliamentary mobilization in Shropshire as Civil War threatened in the summer of 1642Coulton, p. 91 and was instrumental in preparing the king's move from Nottingham to Shrewsbury in September, when the king knighted him.Subscription required: free to most UK public library members. Richard Ottley served under his father in the Shrewsbury garrison. Sir Francis held the town after the king's departure and was formally appointed as military governor in January 1643. He was removed by Prince Rupert in the summer of 1644. Sir Francis was captured by Parliamentarian forces in February 1645 on the eve of the fall of Shrewsbury, although later released. Richard was present at the siege of Bridgnorth in 1646 and was covered by the surrender agreement negotiated by his father, which allowed the Royalist garrison to choose between peace and exile. The agreement explicitly granted permission to Lady Ottley and her children to live at Pitchford.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.303. The estates of both Sir Francis and Lady Ottley had been sequestrated by Parliament. Lady Ottley used the good offices of a friend and relative, Elinor Davenport, in contacting the sequestrators over furnishings and clothing.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.306. and employed Thomas Lee, a relative of Sir Francis and a Lincoln's Inn lawyer, to negotiate recovery of her own estates.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.307. On 16 June 1646 Richard was given a pass to travel to Shrewsbury to speak to Parliament's County Committee,Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.308-9. probably in connection with his father's request to compound for delinquency, which was made on that date. A decision on the allowance for Lady Ottley and the children was soon made: a fifth of Sir Francis's estates was handed over to them for their maintenance by an order of 5 September 1646.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.310. However, the outstanding issues took three years to resolve. Goldsmith's Hall. Frontispiece to Eikon Basilike. Richard Ottley spent a considerable part of this time in London with his father, often having to attend Goldsmiths' Hall, where the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents was housed. On 12 January he wrote to his mother from Gray's Inn to report that his father had obtained permission to live at home and that his personal property had been secured while he compounded. He thanked her for a pie.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.234-5. Richard was admitted to Gray's Inn for legal training on 1 March 1647.Foster, Folio 1020, p.243 In April Lady Ottley wrote to him to report that Sir Francis had not actually gone home as there was a possibility he would be prosecuted by Humphrey Mackworth,Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.236-7. who, although reckoned a cousin, was the Parliamentarian governor of Shrewsbury. Later in the year, on 2 August, Richard's younger brother Adam was also admitted to Gray's Inn.Foster, Folio 1027, p.245 Adam wrote to Lady Ottley in September 1648 in anticipation of Richard's engagement to Lady Lettice Ridgeway,Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.242-5. \\"soe good a sister in ye place of yt deare one w'ch I soe lately lost.\\" The marriage probably took place in January 1649: their first child was born on October. On 24 March Sir Francis, with his last extant letter, sent Lettice a copy of Eikon Basilike,Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.257-8. purportedly a collection of Charles I's final meditations and apologia: the same book had recently been sent by Adam Ottley to his mother.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.253-4. The Ottleys were clearly finding resources to sustain their royalist faith. On 13 April 1649 Sir Francis asked for Richard to be included in his composition.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.242. A reduced fine of ¬£1860 was announced on the very next day. In recognition that the estates were encumbered by about ¬£4,000 of debts, a further reduction of ¬£660 was ordered on 25 June 1649, leaving a fine of ¬£1200 to pay. Sir Francis survived only a few weeks, dying on 11 September, and leaving Richard as his heir. On 9 March 1650 Richard Ottley took the oath of loyalty before two Middlesex justices of the peace to the Commonwealth, \\"as it is now established, without a King or House of Lords.\\"Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.260. This was necessary to gain permission to travel, as recusants and delinquents needed a pass from their county committee to travel more than five miles from home. With permission from the Parliamentary committees in Shropshire and Staffordshire, he was able to travel to the Midlands, settle his affairs and regain his estates. In July he obtained a pass to journey into Wales and to Oswestry on business, and in September he travelled to Yoxall to visit his wife's grandmother.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.261-2. Lettice Ottley was by this time pregnant with their second child, as one of her great aunts, Cassandra Willoughby of Wollaton Hall noted shortly afterwards in a letter.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.265. The end of the year brought prospects of Ottley's completion of his business with the Commissioners for Compounding. On 20 December he was told that he owed ¬£296 and could discharge this in two equal instalments at fortnightly intervals.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.265. However, the sum seems to have been wrongly transcribed, for the next communication from the commissioners, dated 17 January, refers to a debt of ¬£269.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.267. Ottley had already promptly paid ¬£134 10s. The commissioners had reviewed his debts and told him that they required only another ¬£35 10s. This he paid immediately and on 24 January 1651 all seizures, sequestrations and penalties on the Ottley estates were discharged. Ottley seems thereafter to have been mainly quiescent during the rule of Oliver Cromwell. He took no part in the Penruddock uprising of 1655, although he probably alluded to it in a letter of May 1655, sent from his Inn of Court, where he stayed when in London.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.270-1. However, later that year he was faced by a large claim for compensation from a Mary Moloy, widow of Hugh Lewis, a London goldsmith. In a letter to Ottley, Humphrey Mackworth, the son and successor of the earlier governor, alleged that Sir Francis Ottley had confiscated from Lewis jewellery to the value of ¬£600 during the Civil War. When she later sued him, Sir Francis had offered ¬£300. Mackworth recommended that Ottley pay up, as Cromwell was exasperated by royalists because of the recent rising.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.271. Apparently Ottley decided to wait on events and Moloy's petition to Cromwell portrayed her as the daughter of a hero of the Nine Years' War in Ireland who had taken refuge in England during the Civil War. Now having four small children to feed, she had in turn sued Sir Francis and asked his heir for recompense.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.272-3. On 13 October Cromwell referred the matter to Mackworth, who was authorised to summon and question Richard Ottley. The matter seems to have been resolved the following month by Ottley paying Moloy the much smaller sum of ¬£60. Ottley witnessed the funeral of Cromwell in November 1658 and wrote from Gray's Inn to inform his mother, enclosing a printed description.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.275-6. The Protectorate fell apart during the succeeding year. On 25 November 1659, a day after General Monck took overall command of the army, Richard and Adam Ottley were given a pass by Charles Fleetwood allowing them to travel between London and Pitchford without further hindrance:Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.277. the regime had ceased to wield effective authority and had given up the attempt to control its enemies. Restoration and repression Francis Lord Newport, the Lord Lieutenant, was responsible for purging Calvinists from public office after the Restoration. He later suffered a similar fate himself for his opposition to the succession of James II. Thomas Jones, the town clerk of Shrewsbury. A Presbyterian who had remained in the town when it was under royalist military occupation during the Civil War, Jones was nonetheless seen as a threat by Newport and Ottley who went to considerable lengths to remove him. This did not impede his later career and he went on to become Chief Justice of the Common Pleas under James II. After General Monck's intervention against the remaining Commonwealth forces, at the beginning of 1660, Richard Ottley came back into public life and began to take part in local government. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Shropshire in March 1660. There are no records for 1660 but he and Adam, his brother, are recorded as sitting on the bench at the January quarter sessions of 1660/61.Lloyd Kenyon, p.71 Thereafter he does not appear in the record again until July 1662Lloyd Kenyon, p.79 and his attendance thereafter seems to have been sporadic. Ottley contacted Charles II and on 5 March Charles issued a commission from Brussels, appointing Ottley, his friend Richard Scriven and others as commissioners for Shropshire. They were authorised to raise a large militia force for the king's cause, to set up a command structure and to levy contributions for its support.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.144-5 Shrewsbury was still held by the stalwart Parliamentarian Colonel Thomas Hunt, who carried out a review of military resources and preparedness during April and arranged a muster of his forces for 1 May.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.146 However events were moving too quickly for Hunt's measures to take effect. The Convention Parliament accepted Charles II as king on 8 May. Ottley set off for DoverOwen and Blakeway, p.478 to welcome Charles to England in May. Charles entered London on 29 May and Ottley wrote from there to his mother: :\\"My most deare and evere honored Mother, :\\"I prayse God we are safe come to towne, and his Matie, with his two brotheres, the duke of Yorke and duke of Glouster, are now at Whitehall. I met them at Canterbury, and had the happinesse to be of the life guard since Fryday last; wherein my content over ballanced the paynes I underwent. I most, humbly thanke yor Lap for your py which I shiall enquire after. I beg pardon that I am soe short in wrighting, being weary at p'sent: I humbly crave yor blessing: wth my duty and thanks for yor goodnesse to mine, for whom my hearty prayers to God are : I rest \\"Yor Laps most dutiful sonne and servant, :\\"May 29, Ric. Ottley.\\" Shortly after the king's return, Ottley was knighted. On 19 June Ottley and Scriven issued a document at Shrewsbury that effectively annexed the resources promised to Hunt's militia to their own force, ending the dual military authority that had existed formally to that point.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.147-8 On 16 July a letter was issued by command of Charles II urging the Mayor of Shrewsbury to appoint Adam Ottley as town clerk. However, then position was not, as the king had been informed, vacant: the post had been filled during the Commonwealth by Thomas Jones, who was to prove a resourceful opponent to the new dispensation. On 26 July Francis Lord Newport of High Ercall was commissioned Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire with wide-ranging powers.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.149-52 Ottley was made his Deputy Lieutenant on 3 September.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.153-4 The following month Newport appointed him captain of a cavalry troop in the county.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.155 Repression of the old Parliamentarians began with claims that some had taken property from High Ercall and other places. Their houses were ransacked of their houses, resulting in a petition of protest from Thomas Hunt, an alderman of Shrewsbury, to the House of Commons, alleging he had lost goods to the value of ¬£1377 18s. 9d. Edmund Waring, a former Parliamentarian governor of Shrewsbury, and Vavasor Powell, a Welsh Independent preacher and theologian, were arrested and imprisoned. Ottley released Waring after a short time, as he was not persuaded there were good grounds or valid warrant for his detention. A Fifth Monarchist rising in London on 6 January 1661 panicked the Privy Council. On 8 January Newport was ordered to disarm any disaffected people in the county and to administer to them the Oath of Supremacy.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.156-7Coulton, p.137-8 On 22 January a further letter stepped up the pressure greatly with a demand that the county authorities arrest \\"dangerous persons.\\"Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.157-8Coulton, p.17-8 Forwarding the Privy Council's letter to Ottley on 24 January, Newport rebuked him for being too lenient: :\\"I send you enclosed a letter from the Councell, and a proclamation for the moderating of your proceedings. Though it may bee conceived a very ineffectual way for the securinge of persons to send warrants to a constable, yet if souldiers bringe the warrant to him, your ends may seeme accomplishable. You see the letter speakes of leadinge men. Therefore you did ill in releasinge Waringe, and you needed not have apprehended his ranting demand of a mittimus, which will serve him for discourse in his two pot houses. I would advise you to send for him agen, though not as a criminal by proofe, yet as a dangerous person, especially havinge the comand of the Councell for it.\\"Owen and Blakeway, p.480Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.158-60 However, Newport then drew Ottley's attention to an enclosed complaint from Captain Turner, who had been detained while visiting his wife and children at Shrewsbury, though he had a valid pass to do so from the authorities at Hull to do so:Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.160 Newport urged Ottley allow him to leave the town. With neither Newport nor the Council quite able to define their desired balance of clemency and repression, Ottley seems to have erred on the side of rigour. By 4 March the Council was troubled that the Shropshire authorities might be overstepping the mark. They wrote to tell Newport that the king was troubled by large numbers of petitions from those arrested on mere suspicion and that they were to be released forthwith. Many of those arrested were Quakers, who had suffered persecution even before the Restoration. Henceforth, decreed the Council, only the \\"Ringleaders of Faction\\" were to be detained.Phillips, 1904, Lord Lieutenants of Shropshire, p.161-2 Nevertheless, Newport had already recommended Ottley and Sir Francis Lawley as MPs for the county of Shropshire,B.D.

However, the borough of Shrewsbury elected as its two members its town clerk, Thomas Jones, a leading Presbyterian although never an enthusiastic Parliamentarian,B.D.

Accessed 11 November 2013 and Robert Leighton, who had been uncommitted in the Civil War. Attempts under the Convention Parliament (1660) to accommodate the Presbyterians within the Church of England had come to nothing. Jones was determined to entrench Presbyterianism in Shrewsbury for as long as possible. In October 1661 he had a new deed of appointment drawn up for Francis Tallents, the Presbyterian minister of St Mary's church,Coulton, p.139 which was technically a Royal Peculiar but actually in the gift of the council. Jones was supported in this by the mayor, Richard Bagot, and the headmaster of Shrewsbury School, Richard Pigot. The Corporation Act of December 1661 gave Newport and Ottley an opportunity, as it sought to remove Presbyterians from office by forcing them to abjure the Solemn League and Covenant. Newport urged Ottley to use his seat at Westminster to speak out against Jones.Coulton, p.139-40 Ottley's intervention sent Jones back to Shrewsbury, where he tried to get all vacant places on the council immediately filled with supporters. However, the deputy lieutenants sent men to impose house arrest on the mayor and aldermen and removed them from office for refusing to take the oath. Tallents and Pigot, together with other known Presbyterians and ex-Roundhead officers were imprisoned in July 1662.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.310. Newport and a group of county gentry were appointed commissioners to review and reform the governance of the town. They appointed Adam Ottley town clerk in place of Jones on 9 August,Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.295. citing Jones's long record of political manoeuvring, promoting Presbytrerianism, giving legal advice to suspects.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.296-300. This was followed by a thorough purge of Nonconformists from public life. There was widespread agitation against the restored monarchy early in 1663. Repressive activity in Shropshire was initially at a lower level than in neighbouring counties.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.303. However, in July 1663 Newport used the rumour of a plot to seize Chester Castle to send Ottley after supposed conspiratorial meetings of ejected ministers in Shrewsbury, with detailed instructions for spying and intimidation.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.304-5. In October, with rumours of plots still abounding, Newport told Ottley to confine military preparations to the close guarding of the major towns to avoid the expense of mobilising the militia outside the time of the general muster.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.305-6. Later he reverted to warning that the Presbyterians of Shrewsbury might be in league with conspirators in the North of England and recommending that they and Waring be subject to a fishing expedition with a view to \\"entrap some of them in their answers.\\" A similar group of suspects were subjected to further detention in August 1665.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.315. Cavalier Parliament Ottley was elected to the Parliament of 1661‚Äì79, the longest-lasting English parliament, and did not survive to the end of it, dying in 1670. The parliament was known as the Cavalier Parliament because it was largely royalist in sympathy, although important divisions appeared long before it ended. Ottley's election was almost certainly the result of Newport's influence. Newport, later first Earl of Bradford, was to dominate elections until his death in 1708, gradually evolving into a Whig and suffering for it when he opposed the succession of James II. After being a very active lieutenant of Newport in the county, Ottley became a very active member of Parliament, which probably accounts for his decreasing participation in local and regional affairs. He was a member of no less than 230 committees. Initially much of his work reflected his work at local level, with a focus on legislation that repressed religious dissent. He was on the committee that steered the Act of Uniformity 1662. He was also a member of the committees for the Conventicle Act 1664 and a second Corporations Act, both elaborating the Clarendon Code which bore down on both Catholics and Protestant Nonconformists. His political loyalty and zeal brought appointment as a Gentleman of the Privy chamber on 18 December 1663.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.311. After the fall of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon in 1667, Ottley served on the committee to investigate his Sale of Dunkirk to France and another which looked into the running of the fund for loyal and indigent officers, which had been set up by the king to compensate royalist officers ruined by the Civil War. He had been one of the commissioners implementing the scheme in Shropshire.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.301-3. It had proved a disappointment and protests in 1666 led to a review. Ottley's own compensation took the form of commissions to collect taxes in Shropshire, which he undertook with his close friend and business partner, Richard Scriven, later MP for Bishop's CastleB.D.

Accessed 11 November 2013 First they were made receivers of the county's hearth tax, the key tax on property. In 1663 they made a successful bid of ¬£2,800 for the farm of the county's excise. However, the hearth tax concession was revoked in 1667 and Ottley and Scriven were ordered to pay arrears of ¬£700. They sought to collect the amounts owing but this led to public disorder, with distrained goods and papers being stolen. To help his efforts at repayment, he was given any prize-money concealed during the Commonwealth that he could discover. He and Scriven were also granted all treasure trove found since the Restoration, as well as part of a Cheshire outlaw's estate. However, they were still unsuccessful. Ottley's arrears were remitted shortly before he died in 1670, although Scriven did not settle his debt until 1682. Marriage and family Richard Ottley was married to Lady Lettice Ridgeway, daughter of Robert Ridgeway, 2nd Earl of Londonderry. The Ridgeway family fortune was based on the first earl's exploitation of land assigned to him as an \\"undertaker,\\" or government contactor, during the Plantation of Ulster.

Situated about south east of Looma and about south east of Derby in the Kimberley region, the property is currently owned by the Indigenous Land Corporation and occupies an area . It is south of the Fitzroy River and runs back to the edge of the Great Sandy Desert. It has a range of soil types from the black soil of the flood plains to the red sandhills and spinifex country. The manager since 2011 is Chris Daniell and the property runs approximately 23,000 head of Brahman cattle mostly for the live export trade from Broome. Both the Margaret River and Fitzroy River severely flooded in 1894, so much so that the rivers that are normally about apart were united for at least two days. Heavy losses were expected at Myroodah similar to the losses at Yeeda and Mount Anderson Stations. Two landing strips were cleared at Myroodah in 1946 for the mail plane to land on when Upper Liveringa's strip, located across the river and away, was unavailable. The first time the strip was to be used, no ground sheets, to indicate safe landing, had been put out so the plane dropped the mail and continued its run. The property was stocked with about 28,000 sheep in 1947, of which 13,000 were lost while mustering them for shearing. The station manager, Stephen Godbhaer, claimed that the late rains caused phenomenal growth of the cork screw grass, forming a jungle through which it was impossible to drive them. The 1951 wool clip of 185 bales had to be transported off the property by a Douglas DC-3 aircraft after the Fitzroy River had become impassable and the wool had to reach Derby urgently to be in time to be shipped to England.

Lazzarini is a scientist, author and researcher on neurogenetic disorders, including Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. She is an assistant professor of Neurology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS, previously known as University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey or UMDNJ), where her work helped establish the genetic basis of Parkinson's. Later in life, she was diagnosed with Parkinson's‚Äîthe very disease she had spent decades researching. Huntington's disease Lazzarini is a geneticist, who worked in New Jersey as a genetics counselor and coordinator at Middlesex General-University Hospital's Huntington's Disease Family Service Center, serving individuals with HD and their families. The News Tribune said in 1985 that it was \\"one of a handful of multi-disciplinary facilities in the country where various specialists join[ed] forces to address the problems faced by victims and their relatives ... serv[ing] more than 200 families since its opening in 1979\\". Lazzarini helped lobby the New Jersey assembly for a bill to establish a residential facility for HD patients.  Genetic disease research  Alice Lazzarini and Thomas Zimmerman with their poster for Machado-Joseph ataxia at the American Academy of Neurology meeting, 1992 Lazzarini was recruited in 1990 to study ataxia as part of the RWJMS new William Dow Lovett Center for Neurogenetics. In the early 90s, she was a member of the team studying neurodegenerative syndromes including olivopontocerebellar atrophy (a degeneration of neurons in the brain present in syndromes such as Machado- Joseph disease) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). To study the causes of SCA, the researchers first had to locate a family having a large number of members with the disease; according to UMDNJ, Lazzarini \\"established a pedigree that may be the largest in North America\\". One of Lazzarini's patients had located family records the led to a hundreds of individuals in one family encompassing eight generations and including 21 members who had the disease. Lazzarini located another physician who was following a distant cousin of the same family, yielding a combined pedigree of thousands of family members dating to the 17th century. In the 1995 \\"W\\" Family Newsletter published by the UMDNJ- RWJMS Department of Neurology, Division of Neurogenetics, Lazzarini wrote: \\"We have found the 'W' [Whipple] family gene! ... While observing large family trees with many individuals having ataxia, Lazzarini noticed that many family members also had restless legs syndrome. Lazzarini is published in the fields of X-linked intellectual disability and other neurologic disorders such as restless legs syndrome, Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease, and prion diseases. She has been a contributor as well to the literature on genetic counseling. Parkinson's disease Lazzarini was a member of The GenePD Study, a 20-site research collaboration to identify genetic factors influencing Parkinson disease (PD). Studying familial aggregation in a large group of family members with PD, she determined that a subset of Parkinson's cases are familial. She was the head author on a paper published in 1994 pinpointing a genetic component to PD; according to the UMDNJ Science blog, \\"she defined the pattern of inheritance in 80 multicase families\\". Years earlier, the neurology clinic at RWJMS had located a family of Italian origin that encompassed at least five generations of more than 400 individuals and at least 60 members with PD. Lazzarini began studying the family whose ancestors were traced to the small village of Contursi, Italy. In 1995, the RWJMS team joined with the National Center for Human Genome Research at the National Institutes of Health to take advantage of the laboratory resources available from the NIH in an effort to locate the gene causing PD in the Contursi family. Collecting samples from patients in Italy, Lazzarini was a member of the team that reported the first Parkinson disease-causing mutation (PARK1) in the brain protein, alpha- synuclein. Lazzarini worked with the Italian Instituto de Scienze Neurologiche to get blood samples from the family members in Italy whose relatives in the US were also being studied; she \\"pounded the pavement\\" to get samples from strangers, sometimes meeting resistance. Once she \\"witnessed what seemed to be a vicious argument, carried out in Italian with hand gestures aplenty\\"; the 80-year-old woman whose sample was needed was afraid of needles, but eventually allowed her blood to be taken. The findings by the team, including scientists from the NIH and UMDNJ-RWJMS, were published in Science magazine. The New York Times reported that \\"scientists said that finding a site for the gene should help in finding other genetic factors that contribute to Parkinson's disease, which should eventually help in developing diagnostic tests and treatments\\". For ten years, Lazzarini and her colleagues had studied several generations of the large Italian-American family to establish the genetic basis of PD; \\"they believed[d] that fragments of alpha-synuclein bind to other proteins to form the Lewy body, an insoluble proteinaceous material characteristic of Parkinson's disease\\". In less than a year, the NIH and the UMDNJ-RWJMS team of Roger Duvoisin, William Johnson, Lawrence Golbe and Alice Lazzarini, working with the NIH and colleagues in Italy, had linked PD to DNA markers on chromosome 4. Within days of the publication of the PARK1 findings, alpha-synuclein was discovered to be the major component of Lewy bodies within brain cells of PD patients; according to the UMDNJ magazine, \\"This discovery changed the direction of research into PD by providing scientists with an entirely new protein whose manufacture, function or breakdown could be the key to the disease.\\" Personal life Lazzarini was diagnosed with PD, the very disease she had spent a decade researching. She published a memoir chronicling her journey since being diagnosed.

Early life Williams was born on 12 July 1809 at Llwyn Drain in the parish of Ystradowen, near Cowbridge, Glamorgan. When he was around twelve years old he moved to Aberdare with his parents and after working as a sawyer, his father's trade, at the ironworks at Abernant, he became involved in coal-mining and appears to have been one of a small group of miners who struck upon a rich vein of coal at Ynysgynon. In 1837 he married Ann Morgan at St John's Church, Aberdare and they had a son, Gwilym. Williams was a self-made man, in a similar mould to another native Welsh coal owner, David Davis, Blaengwawr His first venture was at Ynysgynon in the 1840s, in partnership initially with one Lewis Lewis. This was a successful venture and he soon opened another colliery at Aberaman, generally known as 'Williams's Pit' having obtained a lease from Crawshay Bailey. His next venture was the Deep Duffryn colliery at Mountain Ash, which he eventually sold to John Nixon for ¬£42,000. With this money he again sank another colliery at Cwmdare in 1853, and, after a further success, he again sold out. In this way he became a wealthy man, owning land at Llanwonno, Trealaw, which is named after him, and Miskin Manor. Cultural interests Williams became a wealthy man, but continued to interact with working class. It was said of him that 'many a man who had plied the mandril, side by side with him could claim him as a close friend to the hour of his death'. He was a generous sponsor of Welsh culture, involved in early attempts to establish a 'gorsedd', and conducting and sometimes adjudicating at local eisteddfodau. A number of these were held in the Aberdare district. He was himself an amateur poet, publishing under his pseudonym, Alaw Goch. He was a prominent sponsor of the movement to establish the national eisteddfod alternately in North and South Wales. In 1861, Williams was the leading figure in arranging a National Eisteddfod at Aberdare, an important milestone in its development as an all-Wales festival. He was also involved with the establishment of the Gwladgarwr newspaper at Aberdare in 1858, which became for a time the most popular newspaper among the miners of south Wales more generally. Industrial relations Williams was regarded as a conciliator, seeking to bridge the gulf between masters and men. In due course, however, he found himself at odds with his employees, most notably during the bitter Aberdare Strike during the winter of 1857-8. Politics His involvement with politics, both locally and wider afield, was far more limited than a number of his contemporaries. He did, however, take the chair at the public meeting held in February 1848 at Siloa, Aberdare to protest against the evidence given by the vicar of Aberdare, John Griffith to the commissioners preparing the 1847 Education Reports. This episode proved to be a notable milestone in the political life of the valley. His comments at this meeting, however, reveal the limits to the radicalism of Alaw Goch, in that he was fiercely critical of the Chartists and considered those attempts to establish trade unions in the valley as being the work of outsiders from England. He was also actively involved in the British School movement and chaired the public meeting to mark the opening of the first such school at Aberdare, known as Ysgol y Comin in 1848. Williams died suddenly at Bridgend on 28 February 1863. On the day of the funeral, according to one local correspondent, 'our town presented quite a sombre appearance. The shops were- closed, St. Elvan's bell tolled solemnly, and a gloomy feeling seemed to pervade the masses of people who loitered in the streets, anticipating with melancholy eagerness the arrival of the remains of the departed bard and patriot.' He was buried in the Aberdare cemetery.

He is presented as a sanctimonious exploiter of her memory, who ill-treated her during their association. Jane Birkin plays both Mansfield in flashbacks and the fictitious Marie Taylor who finds a letter from the dying Mansfield to Murry in his papers. The theme was developed by New Zealand director Stanley Harper, but he was fired two weeks before shooting, and John Reid took over the project, introducing the \\"ghost\\" element and the two time frames. Shot in France at Moulin d'Ande and St Pierre du Vauvray with finance raised by Pacific Films, the film had to be finished before the 1984 cut-off date for New Zealand tax breaks. Plot The film is set in France in 1956, 33 years after the death of Mansfield and a year before Murry‚Äôs own death. Murry visits Andr√© de Sarry a (fictional) French publisher who is about to publish an edition of her collected letters and journals. Murry is presented as struggling with his conscience as he recalls the ill and alone Mansfield (seen in flashbacks), and decides to publish almost all of her work. de Sarry‚Äôs New Zealand partner Marie Taylor reads Mansfield‚Äôs work and among Middleton Murry‚Äôs papers finds a letter to him from the dying Mansfield. She confronts him as \\"another exploitative male\\" who makes a sanctimonious speech at the book launch.

She is best known for her work in child cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychiatry, particularly on disorders of impulsiveness, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and conduct disorder. She uses techniques such as structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and fMRI-neurofeedback.  Education and Profession  Katya Rubia received her BA in Philosophy and Psychology in 1987 at the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. She obtained her PHD in neuropsychology (on the neuropsychology of timing functions in brain lesion patients) in 1994 at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, Germany. After graduating, she was a post-doc research assistant for six months at the Technical University of Munich, in the Neurology Department. She was a post-doc research assistant in Amsterdam, Netherlands at the University of Amsterdam for one year from 1994-1995. Since 1995, she has been working at King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry (Child Psychiatry Department) in London, England, where she became Professor in 2008. She teaches cognitive neuroscience, and is head of the section of developmental neuropsychology and neuroimaging. Research career Some of Katya Rubia's early contributions to the field are that children with ADHD have difficulties with timing functions, which are closely associated with impulsiveness. Her main contribution to the field has been her work in neuroimaging of the disorder. She was a pioneer in imaging the brains of ADHD children in the 90s, which she carries on researching till today, and has substantially contributed to dispel the view that ADHD is a \\"myth\\" of naughty children by showing that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by abnormalities in brain chemistry, brain structure and brain function. She also has imaged a wide range of other child and adult psychiatric disorders such as autism, depression, schizophrenia, child abuse, obsessive-compulsive disorder and others with the aim to understand which brain abnormalities are specific to ADHD and which are shared with other childhood disorders. Another line of research has been to investigate the effects of stimulant medication, the gold-standard treatment of ADHD, and of non-stimulant medications, on brain structure, function and chemistry in ADHD. Recently her research is focusing on the clinical application of neuroimaging to help with diagnosis and treatment. She has used machine learning techniques to test whether we can diagnose ADHD patients based on structural and functional MRI scans. One other exciting direction Prof Rubia has taken with neuroimaging is using fMRI- Neurofeedback to teach children to self-regulate those brain regions that her research has shown to be underfunctioning. ADHD individuals have been found to have abnormalities in very specific regions of the brain, specifically the right prefrontal cortex. She does this by creating a video game that is connected to the brain activation the patients have to learn to increase, and in response a rocket ship moves higher in the sky within the game. . She also uses brain stimulation combined with cognitive training to modulate these brain regions that are not working well in ADHD patients. The hope is to develop brain therapies that have longer-term neuroplastic effects that can help to reduce the symptoms of ADHD. Katya Rubia has over 200 publications in academic journals., an h factor of 61 and sits on the editorial board of the journals of \\"Biological Psychiatry\\", \\"Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging\\" and \\"ADHD\\". She was awarded the Kramer-Pollnow prize in 2013 for her contribution to the research of child psychiatric disorders.  Other interests  Other interests are the research of the effects of Meditation on brain function and structure. She has also studied how meditation could be used as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatment in children with ADHD.

Life and work Appelbee was born in Fulham, the son of a coppersmith. He attended Goldsmiths College of Art from 1931 to 1934, before studying at the Royal College of Art until 1938. In 1939 he produced a poster design, Wimbledon Championships, for London Transport. Whilst at the RCA, Appelbee met his future wife, the artist Frances Macdonald. Appelbee served in the Army throughout World War II. Early in the war he was in charge of a mobile anti- aircraft battery before taking part in classified operations for the Special Operations Executive. At the end of the war Appelbee completed two short commissions for the War Artists' Advisory Committee, one on returning former prisoners of war and the other of a scientist. After the war, Appelbee had works exhibited at the Royal Academy initially in 1947 and then on a regular basis thereafter. His first solo show was held at the Leicester Galleries in 1948. In 1951, the Arts Council commissioned large paintings from both Appelbee and Macdonald for the exhibition 60 Paintings for '51, which was part of the Festival of Britain celebrations in London. Macdonald contributed a painting of Penrhyn Quarry, entitled The Welsh Singer, whilst Appelbee produced the painting One-man Band. Appelbee taught at the Bournemouth College of Art but lost his job after the College implemented the recommendations of the Coldstream Report on the future teaching of art. He continued to paint and exhibit. He produced a number of fine portraits, notably for both Eton College and Corpus Christi, Cambridge, but was also well known for his still-life paintings of fish and other sea creatures. He also completed commissions for Sir Edward Marsh and for Essex County Council. In 1970, Appelbee won the Silver Medal at the Paris Salon and in 1977 he had a solo show at Plymouth. After 1977, a badly broken leg inhibited him from standing at an easel to paint and he turned to picture framing and then to writing verse. An illustrated volume of his poetry, That Voice was published by the Hillside Press in 1980. In 1989 Appelbee and Macdonald moved from the West Country to Kincardine-on-Forth and then to Aberdeen, to be near their only daughter. Works by Appelbee are held in the Imperial War Museum, the Tate and several regional museums in the United Kingdom, including Aberdeen Art Gallery, Leamington Spa Art Gallery and the collection of Leeds University.

Ruins of an old Hindu Temple at Vitcher Nag near Srinagar. Now used as a Mahomedan burial ground Famous Anchar Lake is close to this monumental pride of ancient Kashmir. Vichar Nag is mentioned several times in the history of Kashmir, including the famous 'Rajtaragni' by Kalhan. Vichar Nag Temple  Vichar Nag Temple  Vichar Nag is famous for its spring and two old Shiva temples. One temple is made of chiselled and dressed devri stones. There are two springs with the main big spring as the centre of attraction and sanctity. The spring has a length of 430 feet and breadth of 35 feet. Big sized ‚ÄòDevri‚Äô stones have been used for construction of stairs to the spring on the west and south sides. There is no access on north and east sides, probably to face the morning glory of the Sun. In the middle of the spring there is a stone cylinder of about 3 feet height with a Shivalingam resting on it. Before the exodus of Kashmir Pandits in 1990 the water from the spring used to come out in the shape of a small brook, joining the other brook called ‚ÄòMukhta Pukhri'. After covering a sizeable distance the water used to flow into Lake Anchar. The 1990s saw the exodus of almost all the Hindus of Vicharnag and the temple maintenance suffered badly. With lack of interest either in the history of Kashmir or an ancient temple, the local Muslim population let it fall into a state of disrepair. Dharamshala in ruins Till early 1990s from the time immemorial, the spring water contained many fish. The other feature of the spring is that the water turns ice cold in summer and lukewarm in winter. In the vicinity of Vichar Nag, there were many springs earlier, which have been lost over the time, largely due to encroachments and non-care by the local population.  Religious & historical importance  Vichar Nag was seat of discussion (hence the name, Vichar) and it was in this temple that Kashmiri Brahmins used to discuss Panchang. It is said Jagat Guru Shankaracharya also visited this temple for discussion. Kashmir has been always a seat of learning and it is believed that The 2nd Fourth Buddhist Council (Sarvastivada tradition) is said to have been convened by the Kushan emperor Kanishka (r. 127-151 CE), perhaps in 78 CE at Vichar Nag in Kashmir. Before 1990, on Chaitra Amavasiya, the last day of Kashmiri calendar, a festival was celebrated at this place. On this day, devotees used to take a bath in the holy spring and there after performed puja in the Shiva Temple known as ‚ÄòVichar Saheb‚Äô. Panoramic Shot of the Vichar Nag Temple = Current situation = Due to the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits the temple maintenance suffered. The temple turned into ruins and vandals desecrated the idols and damaged excellent murals, which were centuries old. The centuries-old Shivling was secretly taken away to avoid any damage to it. The springs were used as garbage dumping ground and were almost invisible in the wild vegetation that had grown in the temple complex. Recent efforts of some individuals has resulted in the springs being cleaned and temples and two of its many dharamshalas being restored.

Like a B-tree, a fractal tree index is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children. Furthermore, unlike a B-tree, a fractal tree index has buffers at each node, which allow insertions, deletions and other changes to be stored in intermediate locations. The goal of the buffers is to schedule disk writes so that each write performs a large amount of useful work, thereby avoiding the worst-case performance of B-trees, in which each disk write may change a small amount of data on disk. Like a B-tree, fractal tree indexes are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data. The fractal tree index has been commercialized in databases by Tokutek. Originally, it was implemented as a cache-oblivious lookahead array, but the current implementation is an extension of the BŒµ tree. The BŒµ is related to the Buffered Repository Tree. The Buffered Repository Tree has degree 2, whereas the BŒµ tree has degree BŒµ. The fractal tree index has also been used in a prototype filesystem. An open source implementation of the fractal tree index is available,Github Repository which demonstrates the implementation details outlined below.  Overview  In fractal tree indexes, internal (non-leaf) nodes can have a variable number of child nodes within some pre-defined range. When data is inserted or removed from a node, its number of child nodes changes. In order to maintain the pre- defined range, internal nodes may be joined or split. Each internal node of a B-tree will contain a number of keys that is one less than its branching factor. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. Keys in subtrees are stored in search tree order, that is, all keys in a subtree are between the two bracketing values. In this regard, they are just like B-trees. Fractal tree indexes and B-trees both exploit the fact that when a node is fetched from storage, a block of memory, whose size is denoted by B, is fetched. Thus, nodes are tuned to be of size approximately B. Since access to storage can dominate the running time of a data structure, the time-complexity of external memory algorithms is dominated by the number of read/writes a data structure induces. (See, e.g., for the following analyses.) In a B-tree, this means that the number of keys in a node is targeted to be enough to fill the node, with some variability for node splits and merges. For the purposes of theoretical analysis, if O(B) keys fit in a node, then the tree has depth O(\\\\log_B N), and this is the I/O complexity of both searches and insertions. Fractal trees nodes use a smaller branching factor, say, of \\\\sqrt{B}. The depth of the tree is then O(\\\\log_\\\\sqrt{B} N) = O(\\\\log_B N), thereby matching the B-tree asymptotically. The remaining space in each node is used to buffer insertions, deletion and updates, which we refer to in aggregate as messages. When a buffer is full, it is flushed to the children in bulk. There are several choices for how the buffers are flushed, all leading to similar I/O complexity. Each message in a node buffer will be flushed to a particular child, as determined by its key. Suppose, for concreteness, that messages are flushed that are heading to the same child, and that among the \\\\sqrt{B}+1 children, we pick the one with the most messages. Then there are at least \\\\frac B {\\\\sqrt{B}+1} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{B} messages that can be flushed to the child. Each flush requires O(1) flushes, and therefore the per-message cost of a flush is O\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 \\\\sqrt{B}\\\\right). Consider the cost of an insertion. Each message gets flushed O(\\\\log_B N) times, and the cost of a flush is O\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 \\\\sqrt{B}\\\\right). Therefore, the cost of an insertion is O\\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\log_B N} \\\\sqrt{B}\\\\right). Finally, note that the branching factor can vary, but for any branching factor B^{\\\\varepsilon}, the cost of a flush is O\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {B^{1-\\\\varepsilon}}\\\\right), thereby providing a smooth tradeoff between search cost, which depends on the depth of the search tree, and therefore the branching factor, versus the insertion time, which depends on the depth of the tree but more sensitively on the size of the buffer flushes. Comparisons with other external-memory indexes This section compares fractal tree indexes with other external memory indexing data structures. The theoretical literature on this topic is very large, so this discussion is limited to a comparison with popular data structures that are in use in databases and file systems.  B-trees  The search time of a B-tree is asymptotically the same as that of a fractal tree index. However, a fractal tree index has deeper trees than a B-tree, and if each node were to require an I/O, say if the cache is cold, then a fractal tree index would induce more IO. However, for many workloads most or all internal nodes of both B-trees and fractal tree indexes are already cached in RAM. In this case, the cost of a search is dominated by the cost of fetching the leaf, which is the same in both cases. Thus, for many workloads, fractal tree indexes can match B-trees in terms of search time. Where they differ is on insertions, deletions and updates. An insertion in a fractal tree index takes O\\\\left(\\\\frac {\\\\log_B N} \\\\sqrt{B}\\\\right) whereas B-trees require O(\\\\log_B N). Thus, fractal tree indexes are faster than B-trees by a factor of O(\\\\sqrt{B}). Since B can be quite large, this yields a potential two-order-of-magnitude improvement in worst-case insertion times, which is observed in practice. Both B-trees and fractal tree indexes can perform insertions faster in the best case. For example, if keys are inserted in sequential order, both data structures achieve a O\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 B\\\\right) I/Os per insertion. Thus, because the best and worst cases of B-trees differ so widely, whereas fractal tree indexes are always near their best case, the actual speedup that fractal tree indexes achieve over B-trees depends on the details of the workload. Log-structured merge-trees Log-structured merge-trees (LSMs) refer to a class of data structures which consists of two or more index structures of exponentially growing capacities. When a tree at some level reaches its capacity, it is merged into the next bigger level. The IO-complexity of an LSM depends on parameters such as the growth factor between levels and the data structure chosen at each level, so in order to analyze the complexity of LSMs, we need to pick a specific version. For comparison purposes, we select the version of LSMs that match fractal tree indexes on insertion performance. Suppose an LSM is implemented via O(\\\\log_B N) B-trees, each of which has a capacity that is \\\\sqrt{B} larger than its predecessor. The merge time depends on three facts: The sorted order of keys in an N-item B-tree can be produced in O\\\\left(\\\\frac N B\\\\right) IOs; Two sorted lists of N and M items can be merged into a sorted list in O\\\\left(\\\\frac{N+M} B\\\\right) IOs; and a B-tree of a sorted list of N items can be built in O\\\\left(\\\\frac N B\\\\right) IOs. When a tree overflows, it is merged into a tree whose size is O(\\\\sqrt{B}) larger, therefore a level that holds k items requires O\\\\left(\\\\frac k \\\\sqrt{B}\\\\right) IOs to merge. An item may be merged once per level, giving a total time of O\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log_B N} \\\\sqrt{B}\\\\right), which matches the fractal tree index. The query time is simply the B-tree query time at each level. The query time into the ith level is O(\\\\log_B B^{\\\\frac i 2}) = O(i), since the ith level has capacity B^{\\\\frac i 2}. The total time is therefore O(\\\\log^2_B N). This is larger than both the B-tree and fractal tree indexes by a logarithmic factor. In fact, although B-trees and fractal tree indexes are both on the optimal tradeoff curve between insertions and queries, LSMs are not. They are incomparable with B-trees and are dominated by fractal tree indexes. A few notes about LSMs: there are ways to make the queries faster. For example, if only membership queries are required and no successor/predecessor/range queries are, then Bloom filters can be used to speed up queries. Also, the growth factor between levels can be set to some other value, giving a range of insertion/query tradeoffs. However, for every choice of insertion rate, the corresponding fractal tree index has faster queries. BŒµ trees The fractal tree index is a refinement of the BŒµ tree. Like a BŒµ tree, it consists of nodes with keys and buffers and realizes the optimal insertion/query tradeoff. The fractal tree index differs in including performance optimization and in extending the functionality. Examples of improved functionality include ACID semantics. B-tree implementations of ACID semantics typically involve locking rows that are involved in an active transactions. Such a scheme works well in a B-tree because both insertions and queries involve fetching the same leaf into memory. Thus, locking an inserted row does not incur an IO penalty. However, in fractal tree indexes, insertions are messages, and a row may reside in more than one node at the same time. Fractal tree indexes therefore require a separate locking structure that is IO-efficient or resides in memory in order to implement the locking involved in implementing ACID semantics. Fractal tree indexes also have several performance optimizations. First, buffers are themselves indexed in order to speed up searches. Second, leaves are much larger than in B-trees, which allows for greater compression. In fact, the leaves are chosen to be large enough that their access time is dominated by the bandwidth time, and therefore amortizes away the seek and rotational latency. Large leaves are an advantage with large range queries but slow down point queries, which require accessing a small portion of the leaf. The solution implemented in fractal tree indexes is to have large leaves that can be fetched as a whole for fast range queries but are broken into smaller pieces call basement nodes which can be fetched individually. Accessing a basement node is faster than accessing a leaf, because of the reduced bandwidth time. Thus the substructure of leaves in fractal tree indexes, as compared to BŒµ trees allows both range and point queries to be fast. Messaging and fractal tree indexes Insertions, deletions and updates are inserted as message into buffers that make their way towards the leaves. The messaging infrastructure can be exploited to implement a variety of other operations, some of which are discussed below.  Upserts  An upsert is a statement that inserts a row if it does not exist and updates it if it does. In a B-tree, an upsert is implemented by first searching for the row and then implementing an insertion or an update, depending on the result of the search. This requires fetching the row into memory if it is not already cached. A fractal tree index can implement an upsert by inserting a special upsert message. Such a message can, in theory, implement arbitrary pieces of code during the update. In practice, four update operations are supported: # x = constant # x = x + constant (a generalized increment) # x = x ‚àí constant (a generalized decrement) # x = if (x=0, 0, x-1) (a decrement with a floor at 0) These correspond to the update operations used in LinkBench, a benchmark proposed by Facebook. By avoiding the initial search, upsert messages can improve the speed of upserts by orders of magnitude. Schema changes So far, all message types have modified single rows. However, broadcast messages, which are copied to all outgoing buffers, can modify all rows in a database. For example, broadcast messages can be used to change the format of all rows in a database. Although the total work required to change all rows is unchanged over the brute-force method of traversing the table, the latency is improved, since, once the message is injected into the root buffer, all subsequent queries will be able to apply the schema modification to any rows they encounter. The schema change is immediate and the work is deferred to such a time when buffers overflow and leaves would have gotten updated anyway.  Implementations  The fractal tree index has been implemented and commercialized by Tokutek. It is available as TokuDB as a storage engine for MySQL and MariaDB, and as TokuMX, a more complete integration with MongoDB. Fractal tree indexes have also been used in a prototype file system, TokuFS.

There are different types of orientation camps. ‚ÄúBig ocamps‚Äù (Â§ßO) are organized by the students' union or constituent colleges, while ‚Äúsmall ocamp‚Äù (Á¥∞O) are usually organized by faculty or departmental societies with a view to welcome students who study in the same faculty. The duration of ocamps is usually two to seven days. The aim of organizing Ocamps is to enable freshmen in meeting new friends through getting along with a group of freshmen in the camp. Also, it aims to let freshmen understand and then adapt to the lifestyle and culture in university. It also boosts the sense of belongings of students to the university. Furthermore, some Ocamps like to spread messages to students, for example, standing up against injustice etc.  History  There is no accurate information about the first orientation camp in Hong Kong but the earliest ocamp recorded was in the 1970s,The University of Hong Kong, Growing with Hong Kong: The University and Its Graduates-The First 90 Years, 2002, p. 293 held by University of Hong Kong. Then other universities started organizing it following Hong Kong University.  Group Mother and Father  In each group, there will be two to four group leaders, mostly voluntary senior students (Year 2 or above) and also some alumni. They are known as ‚ÄúGroup Mother‚Äù () and ‚ÄúGroup Father‚Äù ()Negotiating Rebellion: Obscene Poems of Chinese University Orientation Camp, Jimmy Tsz Hsien YUAN, 2009, p. 4 as their role in the groups is to take care of the freshmen, i.e. the ‚Äúgroup sons‚Äù () and ‚Äúgroup daughters‚Äù (). They also have to design and create some handy gifts to the freshmen such as bags, hand fans and bracelets, which represent their groups.  Dem Beat  Dem beat (demonstration of beat), also known as dem cheers in some universities, means shouting slogans with a certain beat or rhythm created by claps and steps. All groups (either as university houses or colleges) have their own beat. The aim of this activity is to promote team spirit and togetherness.  Campfire  Students forming a circle surrounding the fire. ‚ÄúCampfire‚Äù is held at night in which house captains start a fire together with torches and then all participants form a circle surrounding the fire and dance with music. Some common songs are My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean, Dschinghis Khan (Cantonese version) and Pieces of Sea Wave and Spray. Before the activity ends, captains will share their feelings towards the camp.  Game =Situation Game Situation Game, known as ‚ÄúSit. Game‚Äù, in which committees of the camp first gather all participants in a venue, usually a sports centre. The committees deceive the participants by creating a situation that all group leaders have to leave the camp immediately. Group leaders sometimes cry in front of the participants to make the situation more convincing. They then ask freshmen to speak out if there is any solution towards the situation. Before the committees announce the truth, they let participant enjoy their ‚Äúlast moment‚Äù with their leaders. Situation Game aims to teach and encourage participants to stand out and give voice to unfairness. Besides, it consolidates the relationship in groups including participants and group leaders. Students playing with each other at the beach. Hong Kong Hunt Students are required to complete different tasks set by the committee as they run around in the city in limited time. By completing each task, students can get a certain score. At the end of the day, the team getting the highest score will be crowned the champion. Water Game Water game () is a common game in orientation camp. It is the game playing with water such as playing in the beach or playing with water guns. Participants will absolutely get wet. Room Game As a pastime after the conclusion of all planned activities in a day, ‚Äúroom games\\" (Êàø Game) are often played. Room games often last overnight. Participants will follow committees' instructions and play. Usually the games involve some penalties for the losers. Popular room activities include \\"First Impression\\".  Controversy  In recent years, orientation camp has sparked controversy owing to the games played there as criticized for ethical problems. For example, in 2004 Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Health and Social Sciences Faculty freshmen were asked to kiss strangers on the lips, some of whom might develop a bad feeling during such an activity.Complaints Over Orientation Camp Sex Games, South China Morning Post, 2004 Besides, games requiring close contact between the participants have been long described as being obscene and having too much intimacy. These include the ‚Äúcaterpillar game‚Äù as both the girls and boys in participation are required to wrap their legs around one another's waist. Another example is the ‚Äòjumbo‚Äô held by students at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2013, where the females were asked to lay down above the male's body. Activities of cheers have also been condemned by some mass media for the inappropriate slogans used by students, which simply aim to verbally abuse the others. For example, in 2002, in the ocamp held by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), students from Shaw College slandered girls from New Asia College with the use of chants. Some wordings were said to be even discriminating the disabled. According to a daily news article, the Chairperson of Joint Committee on New Student Orientation of CUHK, Kenneth W.Y. Leung, responded that the committee will explain the problems instead of launching a censorship as they believe the self-discipline of students.

The building was originally a church, constructed by the Apostolic Faith Church in 1922. In 1982, Larry Hurwitz converted the building to a music venue called Starry Night. In 1990, the club's 21-year-old publicity agent was murdered in one of the theater's hallways; Hurwitz was convicted for this murder ten years later. Hurwitz sold the club in 1991, claiming he had lost support from the local music industry. The venue was given its current name during the 1991 ownership transfer. During the 1990s, Double Tee acquired control of the hall's operations, then purchased and renovated the building. The theater features a standing-only main floor and an upstairs balcony with an adjacent bar. Peter's Room, an intimate showcase venue with a 400-person capacity, includes a restaurant and bar. Roseland has been named \\"Best Haunted Venue\\" by one local publication, referring to the 1990 murder. The venue is known for hosting a variety of music acts and for its good acoustics. History=Apostolic Faith Church The Apostolic Faith Church bought the property at 8 Northwest Sixth Avenue from the A. Meier estate in 1922 and immediately began constructing a two-story building at the site. To make way for the new structure, church members first razed an older building that had housed a saloon at that address. The new building was finished in August 1922. Made of brick and constructed entirely with donated labor, the structure had a footprint of next to a parking lot. The lower floor contained 11 storerooms, some of which were rented to others, a printing room, the church headquarters, and a small chapel with a seating capacity of 200. The upper floor consisted of a large meeting hall that could seat 1,150 people. The meeting hall was designed partly with music in mind. Its raised platform held up to 70 people, including a 40-piece orchestra and male and mixed quartets that performed during church services. The church sold the building in 1981. A neon sign reading \\"Jesus, the Light of the World\\", hung on the building but was removed in 1981. Starry Night Larry Hurwitz owned and operated the Starry Night nightclub in the building from 1982 through 1991. The venue had a capacity of less than 1,000 people. In the 1980s, the Starry Night hosted musical acts including Animotion, Nu Shooz, and the Crazy 8s. Hurwitz sold the Starry Night in February 1991, claiming he had \\"lost the support of the local music industry\\". The transfer in ownership resulted in a name change to Roseland Theater. In 1992, Roseland's manager for the new owners, Oregon Theater Management, said the name was changed to disassociate from Hurwitz's business and reputation. =Murder of Starry Night employee= In 2000, Hurwitz was convicted of the murder 10 years earlier of the Starry Night's 21-year-old publicity agent, Timothy Moreau, to keep Moreau from alerting authorities to a counterfeit ticket scam at the club. Another club employee, George Castagnola, pleaded guilty to helping Hurwitz kill Moreau. Moreau was strangled in the theater after a John Lee Hooker concert. After selling the club, Hurwitz moved to Vietnam, but in 1997 a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of tax evasion related to the scam. Extradited to the United States and pleading guilty to the tax evasion charges, he was sentenced to a year in federal prison. Publicity generated by the tax-evasion trial led to new information about the murder. Hurwitz was sentenced to 11 years in prison after pleading no contest to one count of murder in 2000, and released in 2008 after serving between 7 and 8 years. Meanwhile, to settle a civil wrongful-death suit filed against him by Moreau's parents, Hurwitz in 2001 stipulated to his part in the murder, agreed that a jury would have found him guilty if he had not pleaded \\"no contest\\", and agreed to pay the Moreau family 3 million in damages. The details of the case were reported in a 23-part series in the newspaper PDXS during the 1990s. Roseland Theater Marquee at the intersection of Northwest Sixth Avenue and West Burnside Street in 2014 In 1991, Double Tee Promotions acquired control of Roseland's operations. In December 1995, The Oregonian reported that the company and its president, David Leiken,David Leiken: * * would be purchasing and renovating the building over several months. Leiken founded Double Tee, which produces events throughout the Pacific Northwest and continues to manage Roseland, in 1972. The project, which included purchase of the building, new lounges and restrooms, and a ventilation system, was estimated to cost between $1.75 million and $2 million. The size of the street-level floor would also increased to accommodate an additional 350‚Äì440 guests, replacing a small club called the Garden. The renovation project ended in 1997; Leiken updated the building's facade and opened a nightclub and sports bar on the lower level. Roseland remained open during the renovation, which reportedly cost around $2.5 million. Theatre signage in 2014 View from the balcony of Kim Petras performing in 2019 Roseland Theater has been called a \\"somewhat chaotic\\" Portland staple, hosting \\"multi-generational concerts every night of the week by everyone from small local bands to huge national icons\\".

Only in the extreme east, by the Steinberg, does the Holzland transition without any clearly defined features into the Frankenweide. The valleys that border and cut through the Holzland are, in places, largely natural. Many, mighty sandstone rock formations outcrop on the valley sides. Hillsides and heights are covered by valuable mixed forest, except in the immediate vicinity of villages. The old sessile oaks harvested here, which are often several centuries old, earn the highest lumber prices overall.  History  View of the Holzland from the Luitpold tower on the Wei√üenberg in the Holzland The quality and density of its stands of trees gives the Holzland (\\"wood land\\") its name. Even during times when large areas of the Palatine Forest were depleted by wood pasture practices, charcoal burning and mining, valuable stands of woodland survived for centuries in this area. Nevertheless, there were clearings here, mainly made in the 9th century in connection with the settlement arrangements of Hornbach Abbey, to whom the hitherto imperial estate had probably been gifted by the Count of Homburg. Lordship over the region was given to Electoral Palatinate. After the dissolution of Hornbach Abbey in 1558 in the wake of the Reformation these rights of ownership went to the House of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken, which, from then on, was in perpetual dispute with the Palatinate. As a result, in 1776 there was an exchange treaty, whereby Zweibr√ºcken surrendered its rights in the Holzland to the Electorate.  Population and transport  The largest municipality and seat of the collective municipality of Waldfischbach-Burgalben lies on the southwestern edge of the area in the Moosalb valley. Upstream are the settlements of Steinalben and Schopp. In the middle of the Holzland, at a height of 430 m above sea level (NN) lies the tourist resort of Heltersberg, and the hill villages of Geiselberg and Schmalenberg. A total of about 11,500 people live in the Holzland. The main transport axes are the B 270 federal highway from Pirmasens to Kaiserslautern, which runs through the Moosalb valley from south to north, and the parallel railway line. In the extreme southwest the Holzland reaches Pirmasens Nord station, where the railway line crosses the Queich Valley Railway from Landau to Saarbr√ºcken.  Sights  Original pilgrimage chapel of Maria Rosenberg The Clausensee *In Waldfischbach-Burgalben there is a pilgrimage site, Maria Rosenberg, that goes back to the 12th century. An annual pilgrimage takes place every year on the Thursday after Pentecost. *The Heltersberg Local History Museum is especially interesting on account of its clogmaker's and shingler's workshop. *At the Hirschalber Mill near Schmalenberg there is one of the largest trout breeding centres in Germany. *Between Schopp and Steinalben there are the ruins of a powder mill that was destroyed in 1927 by a mighty explosion. Until then explosives made here were exported worldwide, particularly for the construction of railway lines.  Leisure and tourism  The Holzland communities are trying to regain a share of tourism in the Palatine Forest. The Friends of Nature and the Palatine Forest Club maintain several mountain huts. There are campsites by the Clausensee lake, at Hundsweiher and in the Schwarzbach valley. An extensive network of hiking trails has been signed by the Palatine Forest Club. There are also several mountain bike routes. Especially popular are the ravine-like valleys with ponds and springs around the Heltersberg and the valley of the Hirschalb, which empties into the Moosalb at the power mill. In Heltersberg is a mountain open-air pool that was completely renovated in 2001.

The highway runs along the western, northern and eastern edges of the city. From the western terminus at I-20/SH 158/SH 349 to Bus. SH 349, the highway is a freeway. Route description Loop 250 begins at an interchange with I-20/SH 158/SH 349 in southwest Midland, with SH 158 beginning at concurrency with Loop 250. The highway runs near many industrial parks with exits for Industrial Avenue and BL I-20 (W. Wall Street). Near Thomason Drive, the freeway passes near many subdivisions on the city's west side. The concurrency with SH 158 ends at an interchange with SH 191 near Grande Communications Stadium and Security Bank Ballpark. Near Wadley Avenue, the freeway turns from a more north direction towards the east. The corridor of Loop 250 from Midland Drive to Garfield Street is the sight of many restaurants and shopping centers, including Midland Park Mall. Between Garfield Street and Bus. SH 349 (Big Spring Street), the southern frontage road serves as the northern boundary for Midland Airpark. Just east of Fairgrounds Road, freeway status ends and Loop 250 continues as a divided highway.

This highway was cancelled on August 17, 1954 with the mileage being transferred to US 183. The Loop 250 designation was used again as Spur 250 on August 27, 1959 as a connector route between Interstate 45 and U.S. Route 75 in Texas near Mossy Grove. This route was cancelled on October 8, 1965 with the mileage being transferred to FM 2989. The current Loop 250 was designated on August 31, 1977.
