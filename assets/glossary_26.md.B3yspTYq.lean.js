This card is the original version of Saturn's Accelerator II (thus the Accelerator II PCB shares both Saturn Systems' and NNCC's logos.) At $598, the Saturn was much cheaper than the NNCC, but little information about the board is available today.  SpeedDemon – Microcomputer Technologies (M-c-T)  * Platform: Apple II, Apple II Plus, Apple IIe * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 3.58 MHz * Cache: 4 KB cache * DMA compatible: No * Upgradeable: No Microcomputer Technologies (M-c-T) SpeedDemon card was the one of early Apple II accelerator which used the newer 65c02 microprocessor, and the first to implement caching technology. This allowed the card to use small amounts of memory, making the card less expensive to produce and eliminated the need to waste clock cycles in order to refresh the dynamic RAM that other cards used. Other accelerators which did not use caching operated at 3.58 MHz most of the time but had to slow down to 1 MHz for this refresh cycle. For peripheral cards that required 1 MHz \\"slow\\" operations, the Speed Demon always slowed access to slot #6 to 1 MHz, while an on-card jumper controlled the slot #4 and #5 slowdown. The SpeedDemon originally retailed for $295.  Accelerator II – Saturn Systems (Titan Technologies)  * Platform: Apple II, Apple II Plus * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 3.58 MHz * Cache: 64 KB on board RAM * DMA compatible: No * Upgradeable: No Saturn System's Accelerator II was the original accelerator for the Apple II series of computers. The card accelerated the Apple II and the Apple II Plus using a faster MOS 6502 microprocessor and on-board high speed RAM. When the accelerator card was activated, software would execute within the CPU and memory on the card, not utilizing those components on the motherboard. The card used a series of 8 DIP switches to configure slot access speeds as well as the speed of the card. Since the Accelerator II was released before Apple Computer's introduction of the Apple IIe, while the card would run in an Apple IIe, software which required a 65C02 microprocessor or used auxiliary memory would not function properly—this problem was solved with the Accelerator //e, which was a complete redesign. Saturn Systems changed their name during the early 1980s to Titan Technologies due to trademark complications.  Accelerator IIe – Titan Technologies (formerly Saturn Systems)  * Platform: Apple II, Apple II Plus * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 3.58 MHz * Cache: 64 KB on board RAM + 16 KB shadow ROM * DMA compatible: No * Upgradeable: No The Accelerator //e was released in 1984 by Titan Technologies, an upgraded version of the original Saturn Accelerator, in response to the introduction of the Apple IIe. The card maintained the 64 KB of RAM of the original card and added the newer 65c02 microprocessor. This card solved the Auxiliary RAM incompatibility problem of the older card, however it did not speed up this second bank of RAM which was common on the Apple IIe.  TransWarp – Applied Engineering  * Platform: Apple II, Apple II Plus, Apple IIe * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 3.58 MHz * Cache: 256 KB on board RAM * DMA compatible: No * Upgradeable: No Applied Engineering was the last company to offer a slot-based Apple II accelerator card, the TransWarp. This new card offered complete slot configurability via DIP switches and speed control via both DIP switches and software. A user could hold down the ESC key upon bootup, to disable the card for speed sensitive applications. In an Apple II Plus, the TransWarp emulated the 16k language card. The TransWarp ran at the same 3.58, 1.79 and 1.02 (commonly listed as \\"1\\") MHz speeds as other accelerators of its time, however, it included a whopping 256 KB of on-board RAM. According to the March 1986 Apple Assembly Line (volume 6, number 6) this is how the TransWarp utilized the RAM: > TransWarp's 256K RAM is effectively divided into four 64K banks. When you > power-up your Apple with TransWarp installed, all of the ROM from $D000 > through $FFFF is copied into one of the high-speed RAM banks. The rest of > this bank is not used. A second bank is used in place of the motherboard > RAM.

If you have a large RAMWORKS in the auxiliary slot of a //e, any > additional banks beyond two will still be usable but at \\"only\\" 1 MHz.Apple > Assembly line v6, #6 March 1996 The same issue of the publication determined that the TransWarp was faster than either the McT SpeedDemon or Titan Accelerator //e when running the same applications, even though all three cards ran at the same 3.58 MHz native speed. The TransWarp was released during the early-mid 1980s with an original retail price of $279. Applied Engineering offered a unique $89 upgrade to the 16-bit 65802 microprocessor, for people who were able to use its advanced features.  TransWarp II – Applied Engineering (AE)  * Platform: Apple IIe * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 3.58 MHz or 7.16 MHz * Cache: Unknown * DMA compatible: No * Upgradeable: No The TransWarp II was a completely redesigned accelerator from Applied Engineering (AE). The company scrapped the on-board RAM design of the original TransWarp in favor of a licensed cache based implementation like Zip Technology used. However, instead of using a hybrid chip, Applied Engineering chose to implement the design on a card. Unfortunately, since the design was licensed from Bits and Pieces, makers of the Rocket Chip, and not from Zip Technologies, Applied Engineering was forced to stop selling the TransWarp II not long after its introduction, due to Zip winning a patent infringement lawsuit against Bits and Pieces for Zip's implementation of caching technology.  TransWarp III (never released) – Applied Engineering  * Platform: Apple IIe * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 8 MHz+ * Cache: Unknown * DMA compatible: Yes * Upgradeable: Yes Applied Engineering's TransWarp III was supposed to be the TransWarp II's replacement after that product's abrupt discontinuation. Because of a dwindling Apple II market in the early 1990s, the TransWarp III never saw the light of day. Some believe that images in advertisements announcing the TransWarp III in Apple II related magazines were complete mock-ups and that the product never existed. The ads touted faster speeds and easy upgradeability when faster 65c02 microprocessors became available.  Zip Chip – Zip Technologies  * Platform: Apple IIe * Form Factor: CPU replacement chip * Speed: 4 MHz, 8 MHz * Cache: 8 KB * DMA compatible: Yes * Upgradeable: No Zip Technologies, introduced the 4 MHz Zip Chip Model 4000 (also: Zip Chip II - 4) at AppleFest in May 1989(?). This was a revolutionary design. Rather than building an accelerator on an expansion card, Zip used a hybrid chip design known as System in Package (SiP), and used this chip module to directly replace the microprocessor in the Apple II. They took a 65C02 core and combined it with control logic and 8 KB of cache ram into a very compact 40-pin DIP package, not much bigger than the original 65C02 CPU it replaced. By creating this ultra compact, slotless accelerator, the entire untapped market of tens of thousands of Apple IIc computers became available. Within the Zip Chip, all settings were software controllable, including individual slot speeds which could be set at 1 MHz or \\"accelerated.\\" The accelerator was a cache type, based on Zip Technology's US patent #4,794,523 and was capable of 10 different speed settings. Zip later introduced a Zip Chip Model 8000 (also: Zip Chip II - 8) which had identical features but operated at 8 MHz.  Zip GSX – Zip Technologies  * Platform: Apple IIGS * Form Factor: 50-pin slot card * Speed: 7—15 MHz * Cache: 16, 32, or 64 kB (8, 16, or 32 kB data, 8, 16, or 32 kB tag) * DMA compatible: Yes * Upgradeable: Yes The accelerator consists of the CPU WDC 65C816 running at most at 15 MHz. A cache divided into 32 kByte \\"data\\" and 32 kByte \\"tag\\". The result is an average 4x performance boost. Two less expensive models were advertised but never released: model 1500 \\"ZipChipGS\\" and model 1525 \\"ZipChipGS Plus\\". These two models were designed to fit into the CPU socket (similar to the 8-bit ZipChip models) rather than taking up a slot. The less expensive model 1500 would have omitted DMA support and was supposed to run at 8 MHz with 8 kB of cache. The 1525 would also have run at 8 MHz but it would have included DMA support and 16 kB of cache. The slot-based model 1600 (\\"Zip GSX\\") was made available at several different clock speeds and with varying amounts of cache. Both the cache and CPU speed were upgradeable.  Rocket Chip – Bits and Pieces  * Platform: Apple IIe * Form Factor: CPU replacement chip * Speed: 5 MHz, 10 MHz * Cache: Unknown * DMA compatible: No * Upgradeable: No Bits and Pieces introduced the Rocket Chip soon after the Zip Chip was released. The product was nearly identical in look and function to Zip Technology's Zip Chip, however it operated at 5 MHz vs the Zip Chip Model 4000's 4 MHz, and the Rocket Chip II ran at a then blistering 10 MHz when it was released after the 8 MHz Zip Chip Model 8000. One unique feature of the Rocket Chip was its ability to slow the speed of an Apple II down to 0.05 MHz for \\"slow motion\\" operability. Although the Rocket Chip was faster in both instances than the Zip Chip, there were some rare software incompatibilities with the chip, while the Zip Chip didn't have any reported problems. These problems were perhaps due to Bits and Pieces pushing the physical limit of their 65C02 cores to squeeze out the extra speed in a game of one-upmanship with Zip Technologies. Zip Technologies ended up with the upper hand when they successfully sued Bits and Pieces for patent infringement and in turn forced the company out of business.  Apple IIc Plus motherboard  * Platform: Apple IIc Plus * Form Factor: Motherboard built-in * Speed: 8 - 10+ MHz * Cache: 8 KB * DMA compatible: N/A * Upgradeable: Yes Apple Computer licensed the cache based accelerator design from Zip Technologies for their design of the Apple IIc Plus. This enabled the computer to run 4 times faster than its 1 MHz predecessor, the Apple IIc. Rather than using a monolithic System in Package design of the Zip Chip, which may have caused overhead clearance problems as well as added cost to the compact Apple IIc Plus, Apple economically separated the Zip Chip design into its individual components, using off the shelf static RAM chips for the 8 KB cache. =Overclocking= In October 2001, Michael J. Mahon, an enthusiast who frequents the Apple II usenet newsgroup comp.sys.apple2, proposed overclocking the Apple IIc Plus.Oct. 2001 M.J.M. comp.sys.apple2 Apple IIc+ overclocking proposal Over the next few years, newsgroup members reported speeds ranging between 8 MHz - 10 MHz simply by changing the 16 MHz crystal oscillator on the motherboard to a faster one (the Apple IIc Plus divides the oscillator frequency by four to attain the actual processor frequency). Some users with 120ns static RAM cache reported problems attaining 10 MHz while others with 100ns chips were more successful.

She is best known for her appearances with NWA:TNA from 2002 to 2003. Professional wrestling career=Early career (2002) Lynne made her wrestling debut in early 2002, acting as a valet in the Columbia, Tennessee-based NWA Main Event promotion. NWA:TNA (2002-2003) She went on to appear with NWA:TNA as \\"Lollipop\\", a dancer who took her name from her omnipresent lollipop. She first appeared in the August 21, 2002 weekly PPV. In September 2002, Lynne decided to train as a wrestler, and began taking lessons from Leilani Kai. In a controversial angle, Lynne appeared topless on the March 12, 2003 TNA pay-per-view while brawling with members of Sports Entertainment Xtreme. Lynne was then involved in a feud with the all-female stable known as Bitchslap, which consisted of Tracy Brooks and Nurse Veronica. During an in-ring segment, Bitchslap issued an open challenge to any women in attendance. Lynne (who was attacked by Brooks several weeks earlier) and fellow TNA cage dancer April Pennington accepted the challenge. They tried attacking Brooks and Veronica but were stopped by TNA security guards. The following week, Lynne challenged Bitchslap to a match. Veronica (without Brooks present) accepted, but was attacked by both Lynne and Pennington until TNA security again stopped the catfight. Veronica then replaced Brooks with a new partner, Cheerleader Valentina (who had earlier competed as JV Love on TNA Xplosion in a match against Brooks). Veronica and Valentina attacked the TNA cage dancers during a dance routine, but were separated by TNA security. A match was finally scheduled between Bitchslap (Veronica and Valentina) and the TNA cage dancers (Pennington and Lynne). However, before the match could fully start it was interrupted by Trinity, who revealed herself as the newest member of Bitchslap and attacked Pennington and Lynne. The TNA cage dancers retaliated against Bitchslap the following week. They summoned Bitchslap to the ring; however, Trinity forced Veronica and Valentina into the ring to fight the cage dancers. Pennington and Lynne attacked Veronica and Valentina with leather straps until they fled up the entrance ramp to rejoin Trinity. The storyline with Bitchslap was then dropped because TNA didn't have enough female wrestlers to compete against the group, and Veronica turned down a two-year contract with TNA, instead attempting to sign with either WWE or a company in Japan. Lynne and Pennington returned to their roles as cage dancers, Brooks and Trinity were then placed into other storylines, and TNA stopped booking Valentina. Independent circuit (2003-2006) After leaving TNA, Lynne worked on the independent circuit as a wrestler and valet, appearing with promotions such as Ring of Honor. On January 8, 2005, Lollipop wrestled in South Korea with the Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling promotion, teaming with Gail Kim to defeat Malia Hosaka and Nidia. In January 2006, Lynne began teaming with Amber O'Neal as \\"Team Blondage\\", replacing O'Neal's original partner, Krissy Vaine. In the process, Lynne replaced Vaine as one half of the Women's Extreme Wrestling Tag Team Champions. The duo held the titles until the April 6, 2006 WEW pay-per- view, when Lynne and O'Neal lost to the tag team of April Hunter and Talia Madison after defeating them in singles bouts earlier in the evening. In September 2006, she decided to leave the wrestling business. She returned for a one-time appearance in November 2007 and wrestled Christie Ricci.

They are easily detected by their loud calls especially during the breeding season. Thomas C. Jerdon noted that the species was found mainly in Central India south of the Narmada and to the east of the Western Ghats as well as the Chota Nagpur and Northern Circars. It can be confused only with the black francolin with which it partly overlaps and is said to sometimes hybridize. This species can be told apart from the female of a black francolin by the lack of a rufous hind collar and the white spots on the underside. The face is rufous and there is no dark stripe running behind the eye. Description This species is endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. It is distributed patchily from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh south into peninsular India (but not along the Malabar coast and rare south of Coimbatore) and in Sri Lanka. The species interbreeds with the black francolin along its northern and appears similar to the female of that species but has no rufous hindcollar, instead having a bright rufous face and throat. The underside has white spots while the legs are orange-yellow to red. It is more arboreal in its habits than the black francolin. The legs of both sexes have no spurs. The species was described by P. J. Selby based on a specimen obtained by his nephew John Atherton of Bangalore (commemorated in Nyctyornis athertoni). The type locality has been designated as Bangalore although the specimen likely came from further north. Three subspecies have been named. The nominate population are from Central and South India south of 20°N while to the north is the form pallidus (type locality Udaipur). This form is paler on the upperparts. The Sri Lankan race is watsoni. In Sri Lanka it has a restricted distribution and is found from the Uvala patinas east to the low- country of Nilgala and Bibile. Populations change during and after the monsoons, and hunters have been known to capture large numbers of nearly 300 from some areas. Distribution and habitat The distribution of this species is to the south of the range of the black francolin. It is found patchily distributed in semi-dry undulating grasslands with scrub or cultivation. It is found in drier areas than the black francolin but wetter zones than the grey francolin. Behaviour and ecology A painted francolin calling from a perch in Pune, India. Sonogram of call of painted francolin They are not easy to spot but become vocal during the breeding season after the Monsoons, from June to October. The call is made in the early morning and has been described as guttural broken crow \\"chee-kee-kerray- Chee-kee-kerray\\" which is answered by other birds in the vicinity. A preliminary click may be heard when at close range. It is usually seen calling from an elevated position such as a mound, bush or tree stump. During the non-breeding season, they may call at dusk. The nest is a scrape in the ground. Six or seven smoky white eggs are laid. They feed on grass seeds (including Brachiaria ramosa) as well as grains of cultivated rice. Beetles and other insects are also eaten. They also feed on the tuberous roots of Cyperus rotundus. When walking around it sometimes has the habit of cocking up its tail and when disturbed it usually freezes and flushes only when approached very close. It roosts in trees but sometimes also on the ground.

Jan Luyken: the man without a wedding garment, Bowyer Bible. The Parable of the Great Banquet or the Wedding Feast or the Marriage of the King's Son is a parable told by Jesus in the New Testament, found in and . It is not to be confused with a different Parable of the Wedding Feast recorded in Luke's Gospel. Narrative The version of the parable in the Gospel of Matthew is as follows: The version of in the Gospel of Luke is somewhat shorter, and refers only to a banquet rather than a wedding feast: The non-canonical Gospel of Thomas also includes the parable as saying 64; its version is quite close to Luke's, although ends slightly differently with a conclusion that \\"Buyers and traders [will] not enter the places of my father.\\"Gospel of Thomas Saying 64 Interpretation The classical interpretation of Matthew's version of the parable is that the king is God; the king's son is Jesus himself; the original invited guests are the Jews; the king's servants who are attacked are God's prophets; and the new guests are the Gentiles and other \\"unworthy\\". The eschatological image of a wedding used by Matthew also occurs in the parable of the Faithful Servant and the parable of the Ten Virgins. The original invitation to the Jews is extended to also include Gentiles.Robert H. Stein, An Introduction to the Parables of Jesus, Westminster John Knox Press, 1981, , pp. 82-91. In Luke, the invitation is extended particularly to the \\"poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame\\" (), evidencing explicit concern for the \\"poor and the outcasts.\\" In early Christianity, the parable may have been taken more openly as a direct reference to Jews who did not convert to Christianity; in particular, the reference in Matthew to the king sending his armies, destroying the murderers, and burning their city seems to be a reference to the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 by Roman armies. Later Christian interpretations have adjusted the original guests more generally to be the already religious who have no time for God, including Christians: they are people who accepted an invitation, but when the food is ready, claim they are too busy to turn up.R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary, Eerdmans, 1985, , pp. 312-313. Matthew's version additionally suggests that even some of the newly invited guests are not worthy of sitting at the table, if they are not wearing a proper wedding garment. What exactly the wedding garment symbolizes is not generally agreed on among Christian theologians. Some commentators suggest that the wedding clothes or garment in this parable were provided by the host, but this is unlikely to be the intended implication. Augustine of Hippo interpreted the garment as symbolizing charity,Augustine of Hippo, Sermon 45 on the New Testament an interpretation not widely accepted even in medieval times.David Paul Parris, Reception Theory and Biblical Hermeneutics, Pickwick Publications, 2008, , p. 250. Martin Luther suggested that the garment represented Christ himself.John Nicholas Lenker, The Precious and Sacred Writings of Martin Luther, 1905 (reprinted by BiblioLife, 2009, , p. 234) John Calvin felt these controversies in interpreting the meaning of the \\"wedding garment\\" were overblown: > As to the wedding garment, is it faith, or is it a holy life? This is a > useless controversy; for faith cannot be separated from good works, nor do > good works proceed from any other source than from faith. Christ intended > only to state that the Lord calls us on the express condition of our being > renewed by the Spirit ... and that, in order to our remaining permanently in > his house, we must put off the old man with his pollutions ... and lead a > new life.John Calvin, Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke - Volume 2. Other commentators focus on the role of clothing (or, in this case, the lack of appropriate clothing) in the New Testament (see Biblical clothing). James L. Resseguie suggests that the missing wedding garment is a MacGuffin-like prop that reveals the guest's inner state or his desires and inclinations (he doesn't really want to be at this party).James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3) 217), 30-31. Bernard Brandon Scott notes that the parable immediately follows the parable of the Wicked Husbandmen in Matthew, and that the harsh treatment of the man without wedding clothes is related to the harsh treatment of the bad tenants in that parable: people hired or invited by the king (God) who do not perform their duties.Bernard Brandon Scott, Hear Then the Parable: A commentary on the parables of Jesus, Fortress Press, 1989, , pp. 161-168. In the Gospel of Thomas, the parable \\"becomes an exhortation against the affairs of business and a life of gain,\\" reflecting Gnosticism's prizing of ascetic lifestyles. Historicity The parable appears in three major works, suggesting it was possibly in the Q source, a hypothetical theorized document or source of sayings of Jesus from the oral tradition of early Christians that later gospel writers drew on. Matthew's version and the version in Luke and Thomas do not entirely line up; textual critics generally suspect it is more likely that it is Matthew's version that drifted from the original, as parts of it seem to be an explanation of the destruction of Jerusalem as divine punishment too closely. Matthew's version makes more sense for a church that has many more Gentiles in it than the one at the time of Jesus's death and additionally has knowledge of the outcome of the First Jewish–Roman War. Art and hymnody Parable of the Great Banquet by Brunswick Monogrammist (circa 1525), location: National Museum, Warsaw The parable has been depicted by artists such as Bernardo Cavallino, Jan Luyken, and John Everett Millais. A number of Christian hymns have been inspired by the parable, such as \\"All is ready\\" by Fanny Crosby,The Cyber Hymnal: All is Ready. and \\"All Things are Ready\\" by Charles H. Gabriel, which begins: > \\"All things are ready,\\" come to the feast! Come, for the table now is > spread; Ye famishing, ye weary, come, And thou shalt be richly fed.The Cyber > Hymnal: All Things are Ready. Music The topic was the prescribed reading for the Second Sunday after Trinity and Twentieth Sunday after Trinity. For the first occasion Bach composed cantatas Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes, BWV 76 in 1723 and Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 in 1724. For the second occasion he wrote Schmücke dich, o liebe Seele, BWV 180 in 1724.

She is best known from MTV's Wrestling Society X. Professional wrestling career=Training (2000) Valentine was trained by Homicide and began her career under the ring name Miss Led with the Long Island Wrestling Federation and spent her time honing her skills all over the Northeast independent circuit. She also appeared in numerous other independent wrestling promotions, managing multiple wrestlers and feuding with multiple others. Independent circuit (2000–2010) In Jersey All Pro Wrestling, she managed Dixie and had her first professional match against April Hunter. Mikosi also managed Nick Berk and Z-Barr in Liberty All-Star Wrestling in Philadelphia and NWA Florida. Valentine also had a career long feud with Alexis Laree. The two faced each other up and down the East Coast in KAPOW!, Southern Championship Wrestling, and Dangerous Women of Wrestling. Valentine has also teamed with the Ballard Brothers in various promotions. She even toured Alaska and wrestled matches for the troops in the Middle East. And as J-Love, she feuded with Pogo the Clown in Xtreme Pro Wrestling. In one match, Elizabeth flipped Tracy Brooks down to the mat by the hair. In early 2009 Valentine took part in the first season tapings of Wrestlicious, where she performed under the ring name 'Kandi Kisses. The show premiered on March 1, 2010. She debuted in the first episode, lip syncing to a song in front of the crowd. She made her in- ring debut on the sixth episode, losing to Lil Slamm. On December 21, 2009, at the tapings of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Impact! television show Valentine defeated Amber O'Neal in a tryout dark match. Lizzy appeared on Lucha Libre USA as Lizzy Valentine Carter. She was a member of The Right with RJ Brewer and Petey Williams. In 2010, Valentine retired from wrestling altogether but stated that she is open to a return as a manager. She stated that injuries to her spine led her to retire. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Valentine also had a brief stint as a TNA Knockout in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. She first competed as JV Love on TNA Xplosion in a match against Tracy Brooks. She was then repackaged as a new character named Cheerleader Valentina and replaced Brooks as the partner of Nurse Veronica in the all-female stable known as Bitchslap. In their first appearance together, they attacked the TNA cage dancers during a dance routine, but were separated by TNA security. A match was finally scheduled between Bitchslap (Stevens and Valentine) and the TNA cage dancers (April Pennington and Lollipop). However, before the match could fully start it was interrupted by Trinity, who revealed herself as the newest member of Bitchslap and attacked Pennington and Lollipop. The TNA cage dancers retaliated against Bitchslap the following week. They summoned Bitchslap to the ring; however, Trinity forced Stevens and Valentine into the ring to fight the cage dancers. Pennington and Lollipop attacked Stevens and Valentine with leather straps until they fled up the entrance ramp to rejoin Trinity. The storyline with Bitchslap was then dropped because TNA didn't have enough female wrestlers to compete against the group, and Stevens turned down a two-year contract with TNA, instead attempting to sign with either WWE or a company in Japan. Brooks and Trinity were then placed into other storylines and TNA stopped booking Miklosi. After her time with TNA, Valentine debuted for Ultimate Pro Wrestling in California and began managing Pro Wrestling Guerrilla heavyweight champion Adam Pearce. Miklosi then auditioned for the 2005 Diva Search held by World Wrestling Entertainment; however, she was not selected as a finalist. Wrestling Society X In 2006, Valentine performed in the short-lived MTV wrestling series Wrestling Society X under the ring name Lizzy Valentine as a valet and girlfriend for Matt Sydal as a heel. On the July 29 edition of Wrestling Society X, Sydal defeated Human Tornado after an interference from Valentine. Valentine accompanied Sydal to the ring where he defeated Scorpio Sky, After the match, Valentine wrote \\"Hater\\" on his back. Sydal began a feud with Syxx- Pac over Valentine, but WSX folded before they ever had a match. Wrestlicious (2009–2010) In early 2009, she took part in the first season tapings of Wrestlicious, which started airing in March 2010, using the character of Kandi Kisses, known as \\"The Britney Spears of Wrestling.\\" She made her debut on March 1 of the first episode of Takedown, performing her new song but was caught lip syncing, causing the fans to turn on her, turning her heel in the process. She made her singles debut on May 26 in the main event of Takedown, facing Lil' Slamm in a singles match, where she lost via pinfall. Championships and accomplishments *KAPOW! **KAPOW!

It is long, and its drainage basin covers . The Chebdar is the only significant and paddleable tributary of the Bashkaus, coming in from the left where the Lower Gorge of the Bashkaus ends, not far from Chulyshman confluence. The river starts on the plateau west to the lower Bashkaus valley and for the first it is a small stream flowing north. At the point where Chebdar valley swings east (towards Bashkaus), three large tributaries, each nearly the size of the main river, come in and make it paddleable. The last of these, Synyrlu, has a trail along coming down to the confluence and this was reported as the optimal put-in. After the Synyrlu confluence, the Chebdar flows in a narrow long gorge that cuts through all the way to Bashkaus. This section was reported as quite similar to the Lower Gorge of the Bashkaus, but narrower, tougher, steeper and with less water. Both banks are generally not passable, and there is significant rock fall danger especially during rainy weather.

They supposedly ruled the lands of Poland prior to the start of the Piast dynasty. Two Polish families claim descent from the Popielids: the Pobog-Pobodze clan is a junior branch of the Popielid dynasty, rulers of Poland from the 7th through 9th centuries, before the era of Bolescic-Piast dynasty (9th to 14th centuries) another junioral branch of the Popielid dynasty. The first document mentioning the dynasty, as well as the last of its members, is the medieval chronicle of Gallus Anonymus. According to it, Popiel II was ousted by a certain Piast the Wheelwright, who in turn gave power to his son, Siemowit. According to a popular legend, Popiel II was then eaten by mice in his tower on the Gopło lake. The predecessors of Popiel II are mentioned by Wincenty Kadłubek and Jan Długosz. Because of a lack of tangible archaeological evidence of the dynasty's existence, little is known of it. Some scholars speculate, basing mostly on the linguistic analysis of personal names, that the Piasts (whose name in Slavic means the one to care for or the one to educate) were initially Popielid mayors of the house responsible for education of the princes, in a similar relation as the Carolingians and Merovingians. Some also speculate that the legend of carnivorous mice (myszy in modern Polish) might contain a grain of truth as the word bears semblance to the name of the first historical ruler of the Piasts, Mieszko (whose name meant bear in old Polish, but see the name section of the article on Mieszko I for controversy on the subject).

He has also published articles in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, and social choice theory. Education and career Gibbard received his BA in mathematics from Swarthmore College in 1963 with minors in physics and philosophy. After teaching mathematics and physics in Ghana with the Peace Corps (1963–1965), Gibbard studied philosophy at Harvard University, participating in the seminar on social and political philosophy with John Rawls, Kenneth J. Arrow, Amartya K. Sen, and Robert Nozick. In 1971 Gibbard earned his Ph.D., writing a dissertation under the direction of John Rawls. He served as professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago (1969–1974), and the University of Pittsburgh (1974–1977), before joining the University of Michigan where he spent the remainder of his career until his retirement in 2016. Gibbard chaired the University of Michigan's Philosophy Department (1987–1988) and has held the title of Richard B. Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy since 1994. Gibbard was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990 and was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences in 2009, one of only two living philosophers to be so honored (the other being Brian Skyrms), and the Econometric Society, and has also received Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities. He served as President of the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association from 2001 to 2002. He gave the Tanner Lectures at the University of California, Berkeley in 2006. Philosophical work Soon after his doctoral degree, Gibbard provided a first proof of a conjecture that strategic voting was an intrinsic feature of non-dictatorial voting systems with at least three choices, a conjecture of Michael Dummett and Robin Farquharson. Once established, this result has been known as the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem. Gibbard is best known in philosophy for his contributions to ethical theory. He is the author of three books in this area. Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment (1990) develops a general theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality. Gibbard argues that when we endorse someone's action, belief, or feeling as \\"rational\\" or warranted we are expressing acceptance of a system of norms that permits it. More narrowly, morality is about norms relating to the aptness of moral feelings (such as guilt and resentment).Allan Gibbard (1990). Wise Choices, Apt Feelings.

Perched on top of a hill, Mirabel is renowned for its mild climate and scenery. It was first mentioned in 1059 as Mirabello Castello. Mirabel-aux-Baronnies is situated next to the river Gaude on a hill halfways between Nyons and Vaison-la-Romaine and had a castle with a tower so high that one could see Orange in Vaucluse. The castle incorporated the chapel of Saint Julien. History Mirabel-aux-Baronnies is the former capital of a Vocontii tribe, the Gaudenses. It is said that Mirabel has its name from the previously mentioned high tower of the former castle, the tower was named Turris Mirabellis. Later known as Castrum Mirabellum, it was part of the county of the Montauban-family. 9 October 1206, baron Dragonet de Montauban and his son Raymond exchanged with Eliarde, abesse of Saint- Cesaire of Arles, Mirabel and its surroundings for the signeurship of Vinsobres. After annexation of the baronnies by the Dauphin, Mirabel grew in importance (it had even its own money) and in number of inhabitants. The castle was fortified and enlarged, the chapel of St-Julien was rebuilt. The domaine de Beaulieu, at the south of Mirabel became one of the principal residences of the Dauphin. In the 14th century Mirabel was heavily damaged by the religion- based wars. Until 1348 Mirabel-aux-Baronnies did have a Jewish quarter called Les Josiols, positioned outside the walls on the north next to the creek Françonne. Due to the suspicion they caused the Black Death, the Jews were either expelled or assassinated in 1348. The houses in the quarter were destroyed. After the arrival of Protestantism in the region, Mirabel-aux-Baronnies changed a lot. First, the chapel of St-Julien was destroyed and in 1633 the castle and a part of the walls. Those walls were restored in 1652 because again the pest was feared, and equipped with 4 new gates. The present church is reconstructed on the remains of the old chapel during 1645-1651. Between 1790 en 1800, Mirabel was chief-lieu of the Canton. After July 1794 (murder of Robespierre) Mirabel was a major centre of royalist parties. Mirabel-aux-Baronnies was one of the first villages having a public water system. In 1876, Italian specialists were hired. They lived for several years in Mirabel and even had an own school for their children. The water coming from the source Tune, more than outside the village, was captured and fed into a system of in-situ made concrete tubes of 20 cm diameter (see figure), alimenting 2 fountains and 4 reservoirs (F: lavoir) with fresh drinking water. The fountains, one of which originated in the 13th century and was later adapted for use with the water system, are still in good condition. Those eldest fountain is situated on the old market- square.

Born in Poitiers in France (Poitou region), Boulestin tried a number of occupations before finding his role as a restaurateur. He worked as secretary and ghostwriter to the author \\"Willy\\" (Henry Gauthier-Villars) in Paris, and then moved to London, where he made his home and career from 1906 onward. There, he opened an interior design shop, which failed to make enough money. He wrote extensively, and was commissioned to write a simple French cookery book for English readers. It was a huge success, and thereafter his career was in cooking. The Restaurant Boulestin, known as the most expensive in London, opened in 1927. Its fame, and the long series of books and articles that Boulestin wrote, made him a celebrity. His cuisine was wide-ranging, embracing not only the French classics but also dishes familiar to British cooks. Among those influenced by Boulestin was the English cookery expert Elizabeth David, who praised Boulestin in her writings, and adopted many of his precepts. Life and career=Early years Born in Poitiers, France, Boulestin was raised by his mother and his maternal grandmother in Poitiers.Allen, Brigid. \\"Boulestin, (Xavier) Marcel (1878–1943)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 25 March 2011 His parents lived apart, and the young Boulestin spent a month each summer with his father in Saint- Aulaye.Hooker, p. 5 He was educated in Poitiers, and later in Bordeaux, where he was nominally a law student, but in practice was a full-time concert-goer and member of the musical scene of the city. He wrote \\"Letter from Bordeaux\\" for Courrier Musical, a musical review,Hooker, p. 6 and published his first book, a dialogue, Le Pacte, for which the humorous writer Willy (Henry Gauthier-Villars), husband of the novelist Colette, wrote a preface. Despite Willy's endorsement, the book was not a success. After compulsory military service in 1899, Boulestin moved to Paris and worked for Willy as a secretary and as one of the several ghostwriters he employed for his sensational and well-selling books, among them Curnonsky and Colette. Willy's stories and novels often included characters taken from his friends and collaborators. His Claudine and Minne series and other novels sketched Colette's youth, peppered with characters taken from other spheres, like the clearly homosexual \\"Hicksem\\" and \\"Blackspot\\", both taken from Boulestin's personality.Caradec, p. 126 Willy's novel En Bombe (1904) portrayed his life with Boulestin and his other secretaries, illustrated with 100 posed photos showing Willy himself as Maugis, Marcel Boulestin as Blackspot, another secretary Armory as Kernadeck, Colette as Marcelle, Marcelle as Jeannine, and Colette's dog Toby-Chien. Also, in 1905, Boulestin's French translation of The Happy Hypocrite by Max Beerbohm was published in the Mercure de France, with a caricature of Boulestin by Beerbohm.David, p. 162 Boulestin had to convince a sceptical editor that Beerbohm really existed and was not an invention of Boulestin's. He also acted on occasion, alongside Colette, in several plays written by Willy.Hooker, pp. 6–7 London and interior design Boulestin was an Anglophile from an early age, even in culinary matters. He attempted to convince his family of the virtues of mint sauce with mutton, bought mince pies and marmalade in Paris, and took Colette to afternoon tea. He moved to London in 1906, and thereafter made his home and career there, though he never considered taking British citizenship (Elizabeth David wrote that he considered it highly improper for a Frenchman to renounce his country). At first, in the words of the biographer Brigid Allen, he immersed himself \\"in the music-halls and theatres, and the follies and ostentatious luxury of the idle rich\\". Among his friends were Robert Ross, Lord Alfred Douglas, and Reginald Turner.Hooker, p. 9 At first he earned his living by writing humorous \\"Letters from London\\" for several magazines, among them Akademos, a sumptuous monthly published by Jacques d'Adelswärd-Fersen. For Akademos, Boulestin also wrote a serial novel with a homosexual theme, Les Fréquentations de Maurice, under the pseudonym \\"Sidney Place\\".Willy, p. 84 The book had a succès de scandale in France, but was thought too racy for publication in Britain.David, p. 164 In the same year he collaborated with Francis Toye, on a lightweight novel, The Swing of the Pendulum.Review, The Observer, 19 March 1911, p. 4 Some of his feuilletons from London were published as Tableaux de Londres in a limited edition (1912). He also wrote for Academy, a review edited by Lord Alfred Douglas; translated plays; and wrote articles that appeared in a variety of publications, including Vanity Fair, Gil Blas, and Mercure Musicale. Boulestin also served as secretary to Cosmo Gordon-Lennox (also known as Cosmo Stuart), a theatrical producer, grandson of the Duke of Richmond and husband of the actress Marie Tempest. In November 1911 Boulestin opened Decoration Moderne, an interior- design shop at 15 Elizabeth Street in the Belgravia district of London.Hooker, p. 16 \\"My stock was small, but modern and first-rate. I had made no concessions. The silks, the velvets, the linens, the knick-knacks and the wallpapers came from Martine, André Groult, and Iribe. I had bought stuffs at Darmstadt, Munich and Vienna; Berlin and Florence supplied me with certain papers, Paris with new and amusing vases, pottery, porcelain, glass, and a few fine pieces of Negro art\\".Boulestin, p. 58 Among his clients was the future interior decorator Syrie Maugham and socialites such as Lady Curzon and Mrs. Hwfa Williams. His firm also attracted the Countess of Drogheda and Princess Lichnowsky, who had been instrumental in the success of the Omega Workshops.Cork, p. 154 During the First World War Boulestin served in the French army as an interpreter to the British Expeditionary Force. Among his incidental tasks was designing the costumes for the famous army concert party, the \\"Rouges et Noirs\\".\\"Obituary\\", The Times, 23 October 1943, p. 6 He sometimes amused himself at the British headquarters by teaching British soldiers how to cook.Beaumont, Tim. \\"Britain's Debt to Boulestin\\", The Illustrated London News, 28 January 1978, p. 77 After the war he returned to London and reopened his design business at 102 George Street, Portman Square. It did not prosper. \\"Perhaps it was a little too advanced—also during those years many shops had started what they called modern decoration; several of the Society women who used to be my customers had themselves become decorators; there was the beginning of the slump, and in addition to all these adverse conditions there were practically no stocks of any kind. Sometimes when there was an important order it could not be executed, the material being out of print, or printed on a cheaper stuff.\\"Hooker, p. 19 During this period Boulestin edited a book of essays and stories, Keepsake, which was illustrated by his friend Jean Émile Laboureur. His income, however, continued to dry up, and he resorted to making extra money through a variety of means, including giving French lessons, making handmade candle-shades, and working as a wine adviser for private individuals.Hooker, p. 20 Around 1923, however, Boulestin was contracted to write a French-cookery book by the director of the British publishing house Heinemann; called Simple French Cooking for English Homes, it was published in June 1923 \\"and was an immediate success with both the Press and the public\\". In England at that time it was regarded as bad manners to talk about food, but to Boulestin, \\"Food which is worth eating is worth discussing\\".\\"Polite Eating – Simple French Cooking\\", The Times, 25 July 1923, p 10 This appealed to the public and such were the sales of his book that it was reprinted six times between 1923 and 1930. Restaurateur and writer In 1925, following on the popularity of his cookery books, Boulestin opened The Restaurant Français in Leicester Square in London. The restaurant was the work of the architect Clough Williams-Ellis and the interior decorator Allan Walton. Its chef was M. Bigorre, a Frenchman who had previously worked for Restaurant Paillard in Paris.Hooker, pp. 20–21 In 1927 Boulestin moved to Southampton Street, Covent Garden, opening the eponymous Restaurant Boulestin on the site of the old Sherry's Restaurant. The new location featured circus- theme murals by Laboureur and the French artist Marie Laurencin and fabrics by Raoul Dufy. Cecil Beaton called it \\"the prettiest restaurant in London\\". The Restaurants of London (1928) described the space—decorated by André Groult—as:Hooker, pp. 23 and 26 The culinary reputation of the establishment was high; the writer Edward Laroque Tinker declared in The New York Times that at Boulestin's \\"one gets the most perfect and récherché dinner to be found in all London\\".Laroque Tinker, Edward. \\"New Editions, Fine & Otherwise\\", The New York Times, 27 March 1938, p. 97 Boulestin's standards were so exacting that despite being reputedly the most expensive restaurant in London, the Restaurant Boulestin did not make a profit, and he was obliged to supplement his earnings by prolific writing of articles and books.David, p. 174 Some of these were written in collaboration with Arthur Henry \\"Robin\\" Adair, a British food writer who in 1923 became Boulestin's companion, literary partner and translator. Among those influenced by Boulestin's writing was Elizabeth David, who after his death emerged as the leading writer in Britain on the subject of food.Cooper, p. xii In her books, she quoted with approval from several of Boulestin's works, including this, originally from What Shall We Have Today?: \\"The chief thing to remember is that all these soups … must be made with plain water. When made with the addition of stock they lose all character and cease to be what they were intended to be. The fresh pleasant taste is lost owing to the addition of meat stock, and the value of the soup from an economical point of view is also lost.\\"David, p. 168 David herself made the same point in many of her writings.See, for example, David, p. 296 She also drew attention to the wide range of Boulestin's culinary tastes. He was not an unswerving advocate of classic French recipes, and wrote with enthusiasm about curries, Basque pipérade, and Irish stew.David pp. 168–174 Boulestin was the first television chef, broadcasting for the BBC in television's earliest experimental days in 1937–1939. In his programmes he demonstrated not only French dishes such as Escalope de Veau Choisy,Escalope of veal cooked in butter, with a white wine sauce: see Saulnier, p. 131 Crêpes d'été,Pancakes filled with summer fruits and Rouget Marseillaise,Poached red mullet in a white wine and saffron sauce: see Saulnier, p. 105 but also deceptively simple food including salads, lamb kebabs, spring vegetables, and picnics.\\"Broadcasting\\", The Times, 18 February 1937, p. 19; 4 March 1937, p. 12; 15 October 1937, p. 28; 13 May 1938, p. 14; 20 June 1938, p. 24; 1 July 1938, p. 4; 19 December 1938, p. 8; and 24 February 1939, p. 7 Last years In the summer of 1939, Boulestin and Adair were taking their customary holiday in a house that Boulestin had built in the Landes. When France was invaded by Germany, Adair was ill, and unable to escape; Boulestin remained with him. Adair was interned as an enemy alien by the Germans, and held first in Bayonne and then nearer Paris. Boulestin moved to Paris to be close to him, and died there after a brief illness, aged 65.David, p. 166 Adair was released at the end of the war and returned to England, becoming the cookery correspondent of the British magazine Harper's Bazaar.Cooper, p. 139 He died in 1956.\\"Obituary\\", The Times, 27 October 1956, p. 11 Boulestin's restaurant continued under various managements until 1994.In 1978 the 75-seat restaurant was purchased by Grand Metropolitan Hotels and relaunched with chef Kevin Kennedy. It was sold to Queens Moat Houses in 1990 and closed in 1994, its site taken over by a Pizza Hut.

Description This is a variable species of frog, reaching 45 mm in length. It is normally brown on the dorsal surface with large lighter or darker patches or raised dots; in some specimens, these patches can be very indistinct to almost nonexistent. A triangular shape of the same colour as the patches is present on the snout, another larger triangular shape is present behind the eyes, almost looking like a reflection to the one on the snout. The iris is a rusty colour in the upper half and brown-grey in the bottom. A white bar extends from in front of the eye around the tympanum and to the arm. The lower lip is marbled black and white. The pads on the fingers are small. The underbelly is white and the throat in males is darker. Ecology and behaviour Despite its name, this species occurs as frequently in sandstone heath habitats as it does in wallum swamps. The call of the male is a duck-like \\"wak\\", similar to that of Litoria latopalmata, although slower. Males will call on warm nights, in spring and summer, often after rain. Breeding takes place in any and all bodies of water the frogs can find, from large swamps, to creeks (stream-side pools are normally used), to temporary puddles (which may depend on follow-up rainfall to see the tadpoles reach metamorphosis).

The Marshalite was a form of rotary traffic signal that was designed in 1936 by an Australian Charles Marshall (1864 - Dunedin, New Zealand \\\\- 3 April 1953, Mornington, Victoria, Australia), founder of the Fitzroy firm of Charles Marshall Pty. Ltd. The Marshalite signal consisted of dials facing each street at an intersection, with a rotating hand pointing to coloured sections that denoted whether traffic in either direction should proceed, prepare to stop, or stop, and how much longer that phase had to go. Variations existed for pedestrian crossings, with additional text instructing people to \\"Walk\\" or \\"Don't Walk\\". The first experimental model was erected in 1937 at the corner of Gertrude and Brunswick streets, Fitzroy, but was removed when its legality came into question. After 1945, Mashalite signals were installed at a number of locations in metropolitan Melbourne, starting with the intersection of Brunswick and Johnston streets, Fitzroy At the intersection of Whitehorse and Union roads, Surrey Hills, the clock was used in conjunction with conventional traffic lights, so that the point of change was absolute and unambiguous. The last Marshalite to operate was situated on the Nepean Highway. A similar system was used in The Netherlands, Vienna and West Germany. In Germany it was called \\"Heuer-Ampel\\", after the engineer Josef Heuer, and was used in a number of places until 1972, when a change in traffic laws outlawed them. For historic reasons, an unused one is still in place in Bochum.

It has two types, accompanied (by breathing) whether after inhalation or after exhalation, and, the ultimate aim, unaccompanied. That state is kevala kumbhaka, the complete suspension of the breath for as long as the practitioner wishes. Breath retention The name kumbhaka is from Sanskrit कुम्भ kumbha, a pot, comparing the torso to a vessel full of air. Kumbhaka is the retention of the breath in pranayama, either after inhalation, the inner or Antara Kumbhaka, or after exhalation, the outer or Bahya Kumbhaka (also called Bahir Kumbhaka). According to B.K.S. Iyengar in Light on Yoga, kumbhaka is the \\"retention or holding the breath, a state where there is no inhalation or exhalation\\". Sahit or Sahaja Kumbhaka is an intermediate state, when breath retention becomes natural, at the stage of withdrawal of the senses, Pratyahara, the fifth of the eight limbs of yoga. Kevala Kumbhaka, when inhalation and exhalation can be suspended at will, is the extreme stage of Kumbhaka \\"parallel with the state of Samadhi\\", or union with the divine, the last of the eight limbs of yoga, attained only by continuous long term pranayama and kumbhaka exercises. The 18th century Joga Pradipika states that the highest breath control, which it defines as inhaling to a count (mātrā) of 8, holding to a count of 19, and exhaling to a count of 9, confers liberation and Samadhi.Joga Pradipika 409-412 The Yoga Institute recommends sitting in a meditative posture such as Sukhasana for Kumbhaka practice. After a full inhalation for 5 seconds, it suggests retaining the air for 10 seconds, exhaling smoothly, and then taking several ordinary breaths. It recommends five such rounds per pranayama session, increasing the time of retention as far as is comfortable by one second each week of practice. Historical purpose 1\\\\. Puraka (inhalation) 2. Kumbhaka (retention) 3. Rechaka (exhalation). Lithograph \\"'breath-control' or Prânayâma\\" by Day & Son from artwork by Sophie Charlotte Belnos in The Sundhya or the Daily Prayers of the Brahmins, 1851 The yoga scholar Andrea Jain states that while pranayama in modern yoga as exercise consists of synchronising the breath with movements (between asanas), in ancient texts like the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, pranayama meant \\"complete cessation of breathing\\", for which she cites Bronkhorst 2007. The Yoga Sutras state: According to the scholar- practitioner of yoga Theos Bernard, the ultimate aim of pranayama is the suspension of breathing, \\"causing the mind to swoon\\". Swami Yogananda writes, \\"The real meaning of Pranayama, according to Patanjali, the founder of Yoga philosophy, is the gradual cessation of breathing, the discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation\\". The yoga scholars James Mallinson and Mark Singleton write that \\"pure breath-retention\\" (without inhalation or exhalation) is the ultimate pranayama practice in later hatha yoga texts. They give as an example the account in the c. 13th century Dattātreyayogaśāstra of kevala kumbhaka (breath retention unaccompanied by breathing). They note that this is \\"the only advanced technique\\" of breath-control in that text, stating that in it the breath can be held \\"for as long as one wishes\\". The Dattātreyayogaśāstra states that kevala kumbhaka gives magical powers, allowing the practitioner to do anything: The 15th century Hatha Yoga Pradipika states that the kumbhakas force the breath into the central sushumna channel (allowing kundalini to rise and cause liberation). The 18th century Gheranda Samhita states that death is impossible when the breath is held in the body. Mallinson and Singleton note that sahita kumbhaka, the intermediate state which is still accompanied (the meaning of sahita) by breathing, was described in detail. They write that the Goraksha Sataka describes four sahita kumbhakas, and that the Hatha Yoga Pradipika describes another four. They point out, however, that these supposed kumbhakas differ in their styles of breathing, giving the example of the buzzing noise made while breathing in bhramari.

Subordinate units * Headquarters and Service Company * Alpha Company * Bravo Company * Charlie Company * Weapons Company History=World War II On May 1, 1942, the 1st Training Battalion was activated at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. A month and a half later, on June 17, the unit was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, 3d Marine Regiment. The battalion received its baptism into combat in November 1943 against the Japanese in the Battle of Bougainville. The Japanese were a formidable foe with the fighting complicated by deep swamps and dense jungles. The battalion fought with distinction for nearly two months before being sent to Guadalcanal to prepare for the next leg of the Pacific Island Hopping Campaign. U.S. Marines from 1/3 fighting on Bougainville in 1943. The Battle of Guam was the next combat assignment for 1st Battalion, 3d Marines. The amphibious assault began on July 21, 1944. Once again, the battalion encountered a tenacious enemy and the fighting on the proved to be both bloody and costly. Organized resistance officially ended on August 10 and the Guam was declared “secured”. However, numerous Japanese remained at large in the jungle refusing to surrender. Subsequently, the battalion participated in “mopping-up” operation through the latter part of October. In early 1945, 1st Battalion, 3d Marines, as part of Regimental Combat Team 3, was to be the floating reserve for the amphibious assault of the Battle of Iwo Jima. The battalion, however, was never called upon to land or to take part in the battle for Iwo Jima. Instead it returned to Guam in March where it continued to remove the small pockets of Japanese resistance that still remained on the island. The battalion remained on Guam through the surrender of the Japanese in September 1945. Although the end of the war signified the end of hostilities, there was still much work to be done. The Islands in the Pacific held by the Japanese had to be demilitarized and the Japanese forces repatriated to mainland Japan, this job fell to 1st Battalion, 3d Marines, soon to be known as the “Chichi Jima” Marines. Chichi Jima was an Island fortress, often referred to as the Gibraltar of the Pacific, located in the Ogasawara Island chain 615 miles south of Tokyo. After 14 years of war in China and the Pacific, Japan had arrived at a mortifying surrender. At exactly 1015 on December 13, 1945, the Japanese flag flying over Chici Jima was lowered from its staff. The Japanese Color Guard folded the flag and presented it to the Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion, 3d Marines. At 1025, the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps sounded Colors and everyone present, American and Japanese alike, rendered a salute as Old Glory was raised to her lofty summit. With the Japanese threat removed from Chichi Jima, 1st Battalion, 3d Marines returned to Guam where it was deactivated on February 9, 1946. Vietnam War A U.S. Marine from 1st Battalion, 3d Marines, moves a supposed NLF activist to the rear during a search and clear operation held by the battalion west of Da Nang Air Base. U.S. Marines from 1/3 near Khe Sahn in 1966. 1st Battalion, 3d Marines became the second American infantry unit to enter South Vietnam. The battalion began its movement, via air, to Da Nang Air Base in early March 1965 and completed its movement by mid-March. Less than six months after its arrival, 1/3 was withdrawn to Okinawa. The battalion was sent back to Vietnam on November 18, 1965. The 1968 Tet Offensive ushered in a new wave of intense combat activity for the Marines and in May, 1/3 found itself heavily engaged in fighting North Vietnamese units at the village of Dai Do near the Cua Viet River. In 1969. the United States began to slowly withdraw combat units from Southeast Asia. One of the first Marine units to be notified to commence stand down operations was 1st Battalion, 3d Marines. The unit departed South Vietnam for the United States on October 5, 1969. Towards the end of the month the battalion arrived in California and was located at again at Camp Pendleton. Shortly thereafter, it was reduced to zero strength, effective November 18, 1969. It then was reestablished at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii as part of the 1st Marine Brigade on November 27, 1969. 1980s Alpha Company aboard USS Tuscaloosa in December 1989 Throughout the 1980s, 1/3 regularly deployed to Okinawa to serve as a forward staged unit in the Western Pacific area as part of the Marine Corps Unit Deployment Program. During the Unit Deployment Program, the battalion would regularly participate in exercises throughout the region, such as in Korea and Thailand. In December 1989, while at Okinawa, 1/3 responded to the 1989 Philippine coup attempt as part of an amphibious task force and sent Marines ashore to reinforce the American Embassy. The battalion formed the ground combat element of CTF-79 (Commander, Landing Force, Seventh Fleet). Bravo Company, 2nd Platoon flew in by helicopter onto the grounds of the American Embassy and afterwards drove through Manila en route to a nearby compound to guard and protect American civilians living in the compound. The Gulf War and the 1990s Weapons Platoon, Bravo Company in the Gulf War In August 1990, 1st Battalion, 3d Marines deployed to Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield and took up defensive positions along the coastal highway leading to Kuwait. In February 1991, 1/3 assaulted into Kuwait as part of the ground war of Operation Desert Storm to liberate the country from Iraqi occupation. In April 1991, the battalion redeployed to their home station in Hawaii. The Global War on Terrorism 1/3 was on the Unit Deployment Program (UDP) to Okinawa, Japan during the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Due to their proximity to Afghanistan, the battalion's Company A was one of the first infantry units to deploy to U.S. Central Command, of which Afghanistan is a part, after the September 11 attacks. The company was attached to the Fifth Fleet, based out of NSA Bahrain and subsequently deployed in direct support of Combined Task Force 53 (CTF 53) for the initial phase of Operation Enduring Freedom. In October 2002, an Army Special Forces Sergeant First Class (SFC) was killed in the Southern Philippines by an IED. Shortly after, Charlie company with some Weapons company attachments deployed to Zamboanga City, Philippines as the Marine Security Element for JTF-555/JSOTF-P in support of Operation Enduring Freedom Philippines. April 2003, 1/3 departed Kaneohe for another UDP in Okinawa, Japan. Alpha company, with Weapons company reinforcements left for the Philippines as the MSE under the guise of JTF-510. Alpha company carried out many joint missions with Navy SEAL/s, SWCC, and the CIA in terrorist surveillance activities, and security missions in Zamboanga Bay. Also, despite the constant threat of attack from the Abu Sayf, and the MILF (Moro Islamic Liberation Front), Alpha carried out security for many Engineering Civic Action Programs (ENCAPs) by building schools and repairing hospitals deep in the jungle. Alpha Company Navy Hospital Corpsman also carried out two major MEDCAPs seeing a total of 17,000 patients. In June 2004, 1/3 (also known at the time as BLT 1/3, and including Battery C 1st Battalion 12th Marines - also from MCBH) set off to tour what was known as a standard deployment around the South Pacific region with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). In early October 2004, the unit arrived in Kuwait and soon after entered Iraq. The unit fought in the Second Battle of Fallujah as part of Regimental Combat Team 7 to clear the city of insurgents and reclaim the city. In one deployment, BLT 1/3 unfortunately lost more men compared to any Marine Corps Battalion during OIF/OEF. BLT 1/3 has produced one of very few nominations for the Medal of Honor thus far in the Global War on Terror, Sergeant Rafael Peralta. After insurgents threw a grenade into a room with several Marines, Sergeant Peralta used his body as a shield to protect his 'brothers-in-arms' from the blast. On January 26, 2005, a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter crashed in the Al-Anbar province taking with it the lives of 26 Kaneohe Bay Marines, along with one Navy Corpsman and four Marine aircrew from a mainland unit. The majority of the 27 Marines lost in the crash were from Charlie Company of Battalion Landing Team 1/3.. Battalion Landing Team 1/3 lost a total of 45 Marines during the course of their first combat tour in Iraq. In January 2006, the battalion deployed to eastern Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. During this five-month deployment they operated throughout the Korangal Valley and were known as \\"Task Force Lava.\\" On June 1, 2006, 1/3 handed over their area of operations to the 1st Battalion, 32nd Infantry Regiment and shortly thereafter returned to Hawaii. In March 2007, 1st Battalion 3d Marines deployed to Haditha, Iraq. 1/3 lost no Marines during this deployment, which was a first for the Marine Corps since the start of OIF. The Battalion deployed to Karma, Iraq in August 2008. The Battalion again deployed to Afghanistan in November 2009 through June 2010, taking up positions in and around FOB Geronimo, within the district of Nawa-I-Barakzayi, Helmand Province. In February 2010, the battalion participated in Operation Moshtarak, the seizure of the Taliban stronghold of Marjah. The activities of Bravo and Charlie Companies were covered extensively in a series of articles by C. J. Chivers in The New York Times, and in the \\"At War Blog\\" posted on The New York Times website. The Battalion deployed once more to Afghanistan in April 2011, taking up positions south of FOB Delhi, in Garmsir District, Helmand Province.

Urem was born in Rijeka, Croatia, where he received his BSc in radiology from the Medical School in Rijeka and also a B. A. in the Croatian language and literature from the Faculty of Philosophy. During 1980–82, he was a singer and a guitarist with a new-wave & punk rock group Istočni izlaz (The Eastern Exit). His name appears in The Little Encyclopaedia of Croatian Pop and Rock Music (1994). He was the literary editor of the Val journal (The Wave, 1985–1989), founder and editor-in-chief of the Rival literary magazine (1988–2000) and also of the Biblioteka Val — an original titles series (since 1987).

He then dumped a bucket of ice water over himself as part of the Ice Bucket Challenge. Shaw has since been heavily involved in efforts to advance ALS research through better funding, and raise awareness about ALS using different platforms. He is considered to be a champion of the cause, and has impacted ALS communities throughout the country. On October 14, 2014, Shaw's college friend Paul Omekanda, who played soccer at Penn State University, founded the Best Man Tim non-profit organization . . to rally the Penn State community in honor of Shaw. Together, Shaw and Omekanda generated new levels of awareness and participation in the funding of ALS research by engaging the Penn State community in innovative fashion. The pair collaborated with Shaw making several television appearances . . while Omekanda ran the organization in the Penn State community. . The organization was a first of its kind at Penn State University, having officially partnered with Penn State Athletics . with a focus on raising new levels of awareness about ALS in the Penn State community. . In 2014, Shaw saw an increase in support from the Penn State community. Omekanda enlisted his mentor Dr. Clarence B. Jones, a close personal friend and attorney of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., . who became the organization's first Board Member. He then led Best Man Tim into partnership with Penn State Athletics (having received unwavering support from Penn State's Athletic Director Sandy Barbour), . . the Penn State Milton S.

It has also been introduced to Belize, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, growing at altitude. The scientific name lusitanica (of Portugal) refers to its very early cultivation there, with plants imported from Mexico to the monastery at Buçaco, near Coimbra in Portugal in about 1634; these trees were already over 130 years old when the species was botanically described by Miller in 1768. __TOC__ Description Cupressus lusitanica is an evergreen conifer tree with a conic to ovoid-conic crown, growing to 40 m tall. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green to somewhat yellow-green in colour. The leaves are scale-like, 2–5 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed cones are globose to oblong, 10–20 mm long, with four to 10 scales, green at first, maturing brown or grey-brown about 25 months after pollination. The cones may either open at maturity to release the seeds, or remain closed for several years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, allowing the seeds to colonise the bare ground exposed by the fire. The male cones are 3–4 mm long, and release pollen in late Winter / Early Spring (February–March in the northern hemisphere). In most of its natural environment the rainfall occurs with more quantity in summer. Varieties There are two varieties, treated as distinct species by some botanists: * Cupressus lusitanica var. lusitanica (syn. C. lindleyi) - Mexican cypress - Foliage in three-dimensional sprays, with small shoots in two planes. Occurs in lower rainfall areas. (Least concern species) * Cupressus lusitanica var. benthamii (syn. C. benthamii) - Bentham's cypress - Foliage in flattened sprays, with small shoots all in one plane. Occurs in higher rainfall areas. (Near Threatened species) Cultivation and uses Fast-growing and drought tolerant, but only slightly frost tolerant, Cupressus lusitanica has been introduced from Mexico's provenances to different parts of the world. It is widely cultivated, both as an ornamental tree and for timber production, in warm, temperate and subtropical regions around the world. Trees have not been selected for cultivation from northern Mexico populations, which have a heavy drought endurance. Locations Its cultivation and subsequent naturalisation in parts of southern Asia has caused a degree of confusion with native Cupressus species in that region; plants sold by nurseries under the names of Asian species such as Cupressus torulosa often prove to be this species. It has been planted widely for commercial production: at high altitudes in Colombia (3300 m), Bolivia, Ethiopia and South Africa, and near sea level throughout New Zealand. In Colombia trees are planted to form windbreak hedges and for preventing soil erosion on slopes. It has been planted by Tanzanian mountain farmers for soil preserving and commercial use since 1990s.UEDA Gen, The Regional System of the Mountain People: Place, Household, and the Communal in Rural Tanzania (Japanese language), Tohoku University Press, 2011, Sendai, Japan, pp.348 - 351. (上田元『山の民の地域システム タンザニア農村の場所・世帯・共同性』、東北大学出版会、2011年) It has been planted as an ornamental tree near sea level in temperate climates and has done very well in Portugal, Buenos Aires Province in Argentina; Austin, Texas and the British Isles where it can reach a height of 30 m (90 feet). It is being planted in the Argentine province of San Luis, Argentina at 1500 m above sea level with forestation purposes for creating artificial forests in a land originally lacking of them in a very similar climate to that of its origin site.

History One of the symbols of Boticas is the Galaico Warrior, an anthropomorphic carved monolith (found in the 17th century) in the castro of Lesenho, at an altitude of 1075 metres, under fields of the parish of São Salvador de Viveiro and municipality of Boticas, considered the most important Gallaecian castro in Portugal.António Pimenta de Castro (2002) The Galaico (or \\"Castrejo\\") Warrior is an important example of Portuguese archaeology and represents, according to several experts, the image of a deity and warrior of the \\"castreja\\" civilisation that lived in this area of Portugal. There were several castros (27) dating back to this early civilization, in addition to various Roman monuments. Boticas has its origins in the Roman civitas Batocas, that was centre of mining, and its Termas de Carvalhelhos, thermal springs with (supposedly) rejuvenating miracle waters. Coins from the period of Byzantine Emperor Constantine X Doukas were also found in Covas de Barroso in 1880, in addition to vestiges in Poços das Freitas or the mines of Carvalhelhos, where Romans were known to have mined gold and silver. No later than 314, Boticas (or Betecas) also became a diocese, as the episcopal term of its only recorded bishop, Sabino (death unknown), starts then. It was presumably suppressed around 400, without direct successor see.http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/bete0.htm Waves of barbarian tribes and Moorish invaders crossed the lands of Boticas during the Middle Ages (many of the local toponymic names reflect this period, such as Côto dos Mouros, Penedo dos Mouros, Estrada dos Mouros, Cova da Moura, Moura Encantada and Mouril). The Barroso surname, which figures prominently in the history of the region, has its origin in the Terras de Barroso, in the Trás-os-Montes. Its first use, came from lineage of the Guedeões (taken from a tower in the locality of Sipiões), whose progeny would adopt and permeate the lands of Botica.Joaquim Garcia (1995), p.313Gabinete de Estudos Heráldicos e Genealógicos (1962), p.107António Machado de Faria (1987), p.88 King Afonso II tried to unite the lands of the Barrosos in 1273, but was unable. It was Egas Gomes Barroso, son of Gomes Mendes Guedeão and his wife Chamôa Mendes de Sousa, both members of the nobility of Count Peter (son of King Denis of Portugal), who were grandchildren of Gueda \\"The Older\\". Egas, a rich man during the reigns of Kings Sancho II and Afonso III, went in 1247 (in the reign of the latter) to Seville to support King Ferdinand III \\"The Saint\\" in Castile. Egas' sons formed two distinct lineages: the Bastos, descendants of his second son, Gomes Viegas de Basto; and the Barroso, descendants of Gonçalo Viegas Barroso and Maria Fernandes de Lima. The Barrosos, were the predominant line, fixing themselves in Braga and Barcelos, becoming signeurs and administrators of the lands of the Trás-os-Montes. Afonso IV continued the process of uniting and defending the territory in 1331, constructing castles and walls around the castle of Montalegre. King Ferdinand donated the lands to Rui Vasques Pereira in 1367, and later to Vasco Gonçalves Barroso. The lands of Boticas changed hands frequently thereafter, until John I finally donated the lands to his friend Nuno Alvares Pereira: the territory would remain in the hands of the Duke of Braganza and their descendants. With a resident population of over 6000 inhabitants in 2001, the municipality was only recently established. It was a creation during the Liberalist regimes of the 19th century, along with the great administrative reforms that developed after the second Liberal Revolution (1832). The municipality of Boticas was legally and definitely established by a 6 November 1836 decree, with parishes de- annexed from the neighbouring municipalities of Chaves and Montalegre, along with the extinction of the municipality of Dornelas and the ancient lands of the Barroso nobility. Other toponymic locations (such as the settlements of Alturas do Barroso and Covas do Barroso), administrative divisions and territory, which also extended to the municipality of Montalegre and the extinct municipality of Ruivães (now part of the municipality of Vieira do Minho), also corresponded to lands of the Barroso family. Boticas, already a central place, was, since the municipality was created, the municipal seat.  Geography = Physical geography  The municipality of Boticas is situated in the northwest part of the Alto Trás-os-Montes in the district of Vila Real, surrounded by five other municipalities: to the north, the municipalities of Montalegre and Chaves, to the south by the Ribeira de Pena; to the east by Chaves and Vila Pouca de Aguiar; and to the west by the municipalities of Montalegre and Cabeceiras de Basto. Its area extends from the Tâmega River until the Serra das Alturas and Serras de Melcas, in addition to the Serra dos Marcos until the Serras do Leiranco and Serra de Pastoria. It is part of the group of municipalities referred to as the Alto Tâmega, integrated into the legendary \\"Region of the Barroso\\", that is constituted by a compact mass of highlands, accented topography, peaks and sierras separated by large depressions. There are primarily two agricultural zones: the lowlands, formed by the interior watershed of the Terva and Beça Rivers (site of vineyards, orchards and cereal fields); and the highlands, (constituted by pasturelands used for cultivation of olive trees, vineyards, potato and rye fields).  Climate  The climate is cold, but dry, conditioned by numerous factors, such as the latitude, altitude, its proximity to the ocean and the predominant vegetation. Its winters are characterized by long cold periods, interspersed by snowfalls and ice-storms, with several weeks of below zero temperatures. The spring, by rule, is very cool, and susceptible to cold- streaks until May, when the vegetation blooms. Summer temperatures are over 35/40 °C.  Human geography  { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Administratively, the municipality is divided into 10 civil parishes (freguesias): * Alturas do Barroso e Cerdedo * Ardãos e Bobadela * Beça * Boticas e Granja * Codessoso, Curros e Fiães do Tâmega * Covas do Barroso * Dornelas * Pinho * Sapiãos * Vilar e Viveiro  Economy  Boticas is known for vinho dos mortos (). During the invasion of the French army between 1807 and 1809 the inhabitants buried their locally produced wine in the sandy soil rather than let it fall into the hands of the enemy. After Napoleon's army, led by General Andoche Junot, was gone, they dug up the bottles. Portugal Virtual Retrieved on March 3, 2010 Initially fearing that the wine had spoiled, the locals found the low temperatures and darkness seemed to concentrate the flavors and improve the taste. The practice of burying them for about two years it still routine and the wine is sold under the title of Vinho Regional Transmontano with the label of Armindo Sousa Pereira. Wine of the Dead - Portugal Retrieved on March 3, 2010  Culture  The municipality is marked by the local gastronomy, which includes the local presunto, stuffed trout, smoked-meats and Barrosan veal.

(Full PDF, p. 162) A version similar to the Ingoldsby one (with some spelling variations) was also noted from 1888. The presence of the song in the United States was noted by Robert M. Charlton in 1842.Charlton, Robert M. (1842). \\"Stray Leaves From the Port- Folio of a Georgia Lawyer, part 2\\", The Knickerbocker 19(3):121–125. p. 123–125. English folklorist Alice Bertha Gomme recorded eight forms in 1894. Highly-differing versions were recorded in Monton, Shropshire, Liphook and Wakefield, Staffordshire, Nottinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire and Enborne. All of these versions were associated with children's games, the rules differing by locality. Early versions of \\"Bingo\\" were also noted as adult drinking songs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYJ2sFJGXNE Variations on the lyrics refer to the dog variously as belonging to a miller or a shepherd, and/or named \\"Bango\\" or \\"Pinto\\". In some variants, variations on the following third stanza are added: > The farmer loved a pretty young lass, and gave her a wedding-ring-o. R with > an I — I with an N, N with a G — G with an O; (etc.) This stanza is placed before or substituted for the stanza starting with \\"And is this not a sweet little song?\\" Versions that are variations on the early version of \\"Bingo\\" have been recorded in classical arrangements by Frederick Ranalow (1925), John Langstaff (1952), and Richard Lewis (1960). Under the title \\"Little Bingo\\", a variation on the early version was recorded twice by folk singer Alan Mills, on Animals, Vol. 1 (1956) and on 14 Numbers, Letters, and Animal Songs (1972). The song should not be confused with the 1961 UK hit pop song \\"Bingo, Bingo (I'm In Love)\\" by Dave Carey, which originated as a jingle for radio station Radio Luxembourg.

John R. HOTALING. http://www.newspaperabstracts.com/link.php?id=41468 1886) was an American soldier, engineer, and businessman. He served as a dragoon in the Mexican–American War and as a cavalry officer and senior staff member of General John Logan's during the American Civil War. After the war, Hotaling was elected postmaster of Rochelle, Illinois; a position he occupied for 15 years, after which he retired and moved his family to Huron. He died there in 1886 of a heart attack. Early life and career Hotaling was born in Sharon, New York, the eldest of ten children. His father, Robert (1796–1886), was a farmer and at the age of 15, the younger Hotaling began training in printing. After completing 18 months of his apprenticeship, Hotaling's father allowed his son to move to New York City, where he began working in a printing office. After a year of employment, Hotaling traveled to Europe; visiting Antwerp, Rotterdam, and other European cities, possibly while doing genealogy research. Upon returning to New York, he took work in a wire factory for several years. On March 20, 1847, Hotaling enlisted in the NY militia as a dragoon, with the intention of serving in the Mexican–American War. Hotaling landed in Veracruz as part of the army that was under the command of General Winfield Scott, and fought his way inland toward Mexico City. During guerrilla action in the Battle for Mexico City, he was severely wounded by a slash to the throat and would have died, were it not for the medical attention of a fellow soldier. On July 21, 1848, Hotaling was discharged due to the end of the war. In 1849, at the height of the California Gold Rush, Hotaling, now a civilian and veteran, accompanied 60 other men on a trip to California by sea. Their ship proved to be very cumbersome, and they were forced to dock for a period in Brazil, where they were invited guests at the birthday celebration of Brazilian Emperor Pedro II. Eight months after initially setting sail, the group finally arrived in California. Hotaling lived for two years in California, but then returned to New York. He married Sophia Waterhouse of Brooklyn, and the newlywed couple moved West, settling in Lindenwood, Illinois, where they lived as farmers. In 1852, Hotaling was contracted to build a two-mile stretch of track through Ogle County. In 1855, Hotaling built what was said to be the first brick building in Lane, Illinois (now Rochelle): a three-story office building which also included an elevator. Civil War In 1861, at the start of the American Civil War, Hotaling helped raise a company of Union cavalrymen that was recognized by the Army as Co. A, 2nd Illinois Cavalry Regiment. His brother Nick, who had also moved to Ogle County from New York, enlisted and served along with him. Three of Hotaling's other brothers served in Eastern Regiments. Hotaling, newly commissioned as a captain, was one of the commanding officers of Company A. He would also command company B of the same regiment at various times. Union General Grant made frequent use of both companies in battle, considering them very mobile and efficient. Hotaling's skill later caught the eye of Union General Edward Ord, who appointed Hotaling and his men as his personal escort group. Hotaling commanded both companies A & B at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Hotaling and Capt. Larison commanded 126 men in the Battle of Shiloh. On November 19, 1863, Hotaling was promoted to the rank of major. After Ord was wounded, Hotaling and his men served as escort to Union General John A. Logan, who later appointed Hotaling as his personal chief of staff. In the summer of 1864, Major Hotaling served under Logan in the ranks of the XV Corps in the Battle of Atlanta. As a part of the Atlanta force, Hotaling may have taken part in Sherman's march to the sea; though, since General Logan had temporarily passed command of the XVth to General Oliver Otis Howard after Atlanta, it is not certain. Major Hotaling did serve under General Logan once more in the Carolinas Campaign. Those who served with and under Hotaling regarded him as a born leader; charismatic, intelligent, and friendly. There soon began talk within the higher ranks of promoting Hotaling to the rank of colonel and a command of his own, but Logan so well-liked his adjutant that he would hear nothing of it. Hotaling was repeatedly passed over for promotions, and would stay at his rank of major until the end of the war. After the war, during Army reunions, Logan was regularly heard praising Hotaling's bravery and resourcefulness. In 1868, General Charles C. Walcott said of Hotaling: \\"Our forces owed their success before Atlanta more to him than any other man.\\" In February 1863, Hotaling received word that his wife Sophia had died in Illinois of tuberculosis. Postbellum career Hotaling retired from service after the war and returned to Illinois, where he married a 39-year-old widow named Carrie Cass on December 9, 1868. In the fall of 1869, Hotaling was elected postmaster of Rochelle, a position he occupied until 1884. In 1871, Hotaling appointed his wife postmistress pro tempore and ventured to Central America, lured by an opportunity in the railroad business. However, the tropical environment proved too harsh for Hotaling, and he returned to the States after six months. In February 1874, perhaps nostalgic about his earlier experiences in Brazil & California, Hotaling traveled to South America with an interest in gold mining. The climate and complex obstacles involved in the trade took their toll once more, and Hotaling returned home after a mere two months. It would be his last known expedition outside the United States. In the 1880s, after purchasing some land in the Dakota Territory, Hotaling moved to Huron but died of a heart attack in 1886, at the age of 62. His body was returned to Rochelle, where it is buried in the Lawnridge Cemetery. His grave, to this day, is routinely decorated on Memorial Day. A 2004 article in the Rochelle News-Leader suggested Hotaling may have played a part in the holiday's creation, due to his close work relationship with General Logan (Logan is regarded as a \\"founding father\\" of Memorial Day); however, evidence of this claim is scant. Hotaling had two children with his first wife Sophia, and one son with his second wife Carrie. ReferencesFurther reading * Fletcher, Samuel and D.H.

There is a firmly established tradition regarding St. Dabheog, who presided over, and possibly established, the monastery on the site during the lifetime of Patrick.Harbison, Peter. Pilgrimage in Ireland: The Monuments and the People. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1995. His name has been associated from early centuries with several places in the area: St. Dabheoc's Chair on the south bank of Lough Derg, the townland of Seedavoc (St. Dabheoc's Seat), and a mountain in that townland, Seavadog Mountain. One of the islands in Lough Derg was also named after him: St. Dabheoc's Island, which may have been Saints Island. Archdall, Mervyn. Monasticon Hibernicum, W. B. Kelly, 1873, p. 206 Many of the modern Catholic pilgrimage rituals at Lough Derg are focused on devotion to St. Dabheog: including the short hike to a pre-Christian Bronze Age burial site (known as Dabheog's Chair or Seat) on a hill overlooking Lough Derg, and the meditation upon one of the beehive cells on Station Island which is dedicated to the saint.McGuinne, Joseph: \\"St. Patrick's Purgatory: Lough Derg, page 18.

In terms of narrative, this discourse tells the story of King Ajatasattu, son and successor of King Bimbisara of Magadha, who posed the following question to many leading Indian spiritual teachers: What is the benefit of living a contemplative life? After being dissatisfied with the answers provided by these other teachers, the king posed this question to the Buddha whose answer motivated the king to become a lay follower of the Buddha. In terms of Indian philosophy and spiritual doctrines, this discourse: * provides the Buddha's own description of the lifestyle, mental, psychic and spiritual benefits (\\"fruit\\") of the Buddhist contemplative life; * provides one of the most detailed accounts in the Sutta Pitaka of the Buddhist community's code of ethical behavior; * describes from the Buddhist standpoint the essence of the teachings of several leading spiritual guides in the Buddha's time (see the table below for more details); and, * through the narrative of King Ajatasattu's confessed transgression and his subsequent psychic unrest, paranoia and karmic impediments, the narrative illustrates Buddhist notions of merit and kamma in juxtaposition to those associated with other contemporaneous teachers (who, for instance, are depicted as advocating views of amorality, fatalism, materialism, eternalism and agnosticism). Thanissaro Bhikkhu refers to this discourse as \\"one of the masterpieces of the Pali canon.\\"In the introduction to his translation, Thanissaro (1997) states: :\\"This discourse is one of the masterpieces of the Pali canon. At heart, it is a comprehensive portrait of the Buddhist path of training, illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes. This portrait is placed in juxtaposition to the Buddhist view of the teachings of rival philosophical teachers of the time, showing how the Buddha — in contradistinction to the inflexible, party-line approach of his contemporaries — presented his teaching in a way that was pertinent and sensitive to the needs of his listeners. This larger portrait of the intellectual landscape of early Buddhist India is then presented in a moving narrative frame: the sad story of King Ajatasattu.\\" Content=The king's unrest Upon a bright uposatha night, King Ajatasattu, monarch of Magadha Kingdom, who was in the mood to hear a Dhamma discourse, asked his ministers if there was any worthy teacher \\"who might enlighten and bring peace to our mind.\\"Thanissaro (1997). The ministers in turn suggested that the monarch visited a variety of teachers, all of whom the King rejected by being silent. But when the King's physician, Jivaka, who was silent all the time, was asked if he could suggest a teacher to visit, the physician quickly replied that the Buddha was currently staying in the physician's mango groves. The King immediately agreed to go there. After preparing the elephants and his followers, the King rode to the mango groves. Yet, upon arriving on the Groves, the King was suddenly overcome with worry and doubt. The hairs on his body even stood up as he felt an agonizing fear. He asked his physician nervously and suspiciously, \\"Are you not deceiving me, Jivaka? Do you not betray me and hand my life to the enemies? How come it happens that there is not a single sound heard at all, not even coughs or sneezes in the huge group of 1,250 Sangha monks?\\" To answer his majesty's paranoia, the physician calmly reassured the monarch, \\"Do not worry, your Majesty. I am not lying, or deceiving, or betraying you to your enemies. Proceed on, your Majesty! There, in the Hall, where the lights are lit.\\" The King proceeded and when he entered the Hall, he had difficulty in spotting where the Buddha was. To his king's aid, Jivaka answered that the Buddha was sitting on the back of a pillar, surrounded by his disciples. The King then approached the Buddha and gave his salutation. Then, while standing, he saw how the Monks sat in silence, calm like a still, waveless lake. He exclaimed: \\"Can my beloved son, Udayi Bhadda, possess such calmness and composure as the Monks show me now?\\" The Buddha asked him, \\"If so, Your Majesty, how do you direct your mind towards compassion and love?\\" \\"Bhante, I love my son very dearly, and I wish for him to possess the calmness as like the monks have now.\\" The Monarch then prostrated himself towards the Buddha, clasped his palms in salutation to the monks, and then proceeded to sit on the Buddha's side. The monarch then asked, \\"If my teacher doesn't mind, may I ask you a question?\\" \\"Ask what you want to ask, King.\\"  The king's questioning of six ascetics  The King asks, \\"Bhante (Teacher), there are a number of skills and talents, such as: elephant-drivers, chariot-drivers, horse riders, archers, palanquin bearers, army commander's adjutants, royal officers, soldiers, warriors with elephant's courage, heroes, fighters, troops in deer- skin uniform, slaves, cooks and chefs, barbers, bathers, bakers, florists, launderers, weavers, crafters, potters, mathematicians, accountants, and many other skills. In their current life, they enjoy the real fruits of their skills. They support their life, their family, parents, and friends with their skills in happiness and welfare. They donate high-valued gifts and offerings to the Brahmins and the ascetics, giving them rewards of a joyful next life in heaven, and other joys. Can the Bhante instruct me in what are the real benefits of a contemplative life in this current life?\\" The Buddha then replied, \\"Your Majesty, have you ever asked this question to any other teachers, brahmins, or ascetics?\\" The King replied by repeating what each of six revered ascetic teachers allegedlyThe king's recollection and/or the Canon's recording of the non-Buddhist ascetics' statements can be viewed with some caution. For instance, Walshe (1995), p. 545 n. 115, notes that the king's restatements of the alleged response by Nigantha Nataputta (which is the Pali Canon's appellation for the Jain's seminal leader, Mahavira) \\"do not represent the genuine Jain teaching but seem to parody it in punning form.\\" Moreover, Walshe further states that the \\"reference to one 'free from bonds' [the literal meaning of Nigantha] and yet bound by these [aforementioned] restraints (whatever they are) is a deliberate paradox.\\" These same statements of parody/paradox are found in MN 56, Upāli Sutta. told him. (These responses are summarized in the adjacent table.) The king found each of these answers to be dissatisfying: \\"Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango.\\" The Buddhist fruit of the contemplative life The Buddha then elaborated on his perspective regarding the benefits of the contemplative life, moving from the material to the spiritual:For instance, Thanissaro (1997) notes in the introduction to his translation: \\"The question [the king] puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding, so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training, beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up, as a way of raising the king's spiritual horizons.\\" * Solitude's delight: For instance, for slaves and farmers, freedom from servitude resulting in being \\"content with the simplest food and shelter, delighting in solitude\\"This and all subsequent quotes on this list are from Thanissaro (1997). as well as the veneration of others. * Virtue's pleasure: \\"[T]he monk ... consummate in virtue sees no danger anywhere from his restraint through virtue. Endowed with this noble aggregate of virtue, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of being blameless.\\" * Simplicity's contentment: \\"Wherever he goes, he takes only his barest necessities along. This is how a monk is content.\\" * Mental calm: With mindfulness and alertness (see sampajanna), a monk cleanses his mind of covetousness, ill will and anger, sloth and drowsiness, restlessness and anxiety, and doubt (see the Five Hindrances). * Jhanic bliss: He attains the four jhanic states which are associated with the permeating of his body with rapture, pleasure, equanimity, and a pure, bright awareness. * Insight knowledge: \\"[W]ith his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability — the monk directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision. He discerns: 'This body of mine is endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion. And this consciousness of mine is supported here and bound up here.'\\" * Supernatural powers: \\"Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful.... He hears — by means of the divine ear- element, purified and surpassing the human — both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far.\\" * Mind reading: He can discern in others states of consciousness such as those with or without passion, lust, delusion, concentration, etc. (see the Satipatthana Sutta regarding mindfulness of the mind). * Three knowledges: He can recollect past lives, see the rebirth of other beings, and knows the ending of suffering and the fermentations of sensuality, becoming and ignorance. * Release from samsara: \\"His heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, is released from the fermentation of sensuality, the fermentation of becoming, the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'\\" Upon hearing the Buddha's explanation, King Ajatasattu declared himself a lay follower of the Buddha. The king's patricide and its karmic consequences The king then confessed that he himself had killed his own father so as to become king. The Buddha replied: :\\"Yes, great king, a transgression overcame you in that you were so foolish, so muddle-headed, and so unskilled as to kill your father — a righteous man, a righteous king — for the sake of sovereign rulership. But because you see your transgression as such and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept your confession. For it is a cause of growth in the Dhamma & Discipline of the noble ones when, seeing a transgression as such, one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma and exercises restraint in the future.\\" The Buddha subsequently declared: \\"... Had [King Ajatasattu] not killed his father [King Bimbisara] — that righteous man, that righteous king — the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye would have arisen to him as he sat in this very seat.\\"Thanissaro (1997). Based on the Pali commentarial literature and tradition, Thanissaro (1997) provides additional details about the king's life: after the Buddha's death, King Ajatasattu sponsored the First Buddhist Council; King Ajatasattu was ultimately killed by his own son, Udayibhadda; because of King Ajatasattu's killing of his own father, upon King Ajatasattu's death he is immediately destined for a hell realm; and yet because of King Ajatasattu's merit in sponsoring the Council, after the hell realm the former king is to be reborn as a human and awakened as a pratyekabuddha.

The development of the shopping centre was a moment of significance in the development of Bankstown as a satellite centre of south-western Sydney. Not only did it bring major retailers such as David Jones Limited, the premium department store, to the area for the first time, it also became a centre of community and governmental service provision for south-western Sydney.M Bailey (2005). \\"Power, politics and payments in pot plants : shopping centre development in Bankstown 1955–2005\\". Melbourne Historical Journal, Vol. 33, p.13-24 Change of ownership and rebranding In 2002, the centre was owned 50-50 by the General Property Trust (GPT) and the Government Superannuation Office (GSO). In October 2002, GPT divested its 50% interest in Bankstown Square to Centro Properties Group for $176 million,General Property Trust Archive News – gpt.com.au. Retrieved 17 August 2006. the remaining 50% share was sold to another Centro vehicle in 2003. The shopping centre was renamed \\"Centro Bankstown\\". Centro Properties Group was restructured in 2011 due to financial difficulty and accounting irregularities. The successor entity, Federation Limited, rebranded the centre to \\"Bankstown Central\\" in 2013.\\"Federation Centres locks in $600m mall deal with Challenger\\", The Australian, 6 June 2013 Redevelopment Expansion of Bankstown Central (2008) Bankstown Central (2008) The shopping centre has undergone a two-stage major \\"redevelopment program\\" which was completed in mid-2008. =Stage I: Extensions and relocations (2006–2007)= In July 2006, the extension to the complex was completed adding 26,000 m² of retail space and bringing the total gross leasable area to 66,500 m².Centro Press Release – burnett.com.au. Retrieved 17 August 2006. It features a new Woolworths, the largest Big W in NSW, as well as 28 additional speciality stores. Franklins moved to the old Woolworths premises in December 2006, and a new mall featuring twenty new stores opened in November 2007 where it was once located. The new mall connects the Grand Market fresh food area with the food court. New stores were opened (e.g. Game, Bankwest), some stores closed down (e.g. JB Hi-Fi, Tandy), while others relocated (e.g. Best & Less) or underwent major renovations (e.g. Dick Smith Electronics). =Stage II: Myer Bankstown (2007–2008)= Myer opened on 17 May 2008, on the site of the old David Jones store. David Jones pulled out of the Bankstown site after the 40-year lease of the store was up because the area did not fit their demographics, making the store unprofitable.http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/David-Jones-dumps-Bankstown- store/2007/05/17/1178995279971.html This is similar to the swap that happened at Westfield Eastgardens and Westfield Burwood, the latter in a reverse direction with David Jones replaced a Myer store. The Bankstown Myer store stocks more than the old David Jones store and is the largest store at Bankstown at 10,150m². Plus a new National Australia Bank branch was located next to the RTA.  Future redevelopments  Vicinity Centres is planning 2 billion redevelopment of Bankstown Central. The redevelopment includes building multiple towers over the shopping centre and creating an additional 300,000 square metres of new space. Development applications are set to be lodged in early 2020.  Incident  On 29 April 2016, a shooting incident occurred on a rooftop carpark of Bankstown Central just before midday. One person was shot dead and two others were injured. The shooting was a targeted and payback attack and the incident could be connected with a fatal shooting in Condell Park earlier in April. The carpark was closed after the incident and the centre continued trading as normal.

On June 17 of that same year, they were redesignated the \\"2d Training Battalion, 3rd Marines\\" and in September were deployed to Tutuila, American Samoa and reassigned to the 2d Marine Brigade. They remained there until they moved to Auckland, New Zealand in May 1943. In June of that year, they were reassigned to the 3d Marine Division and were again moved to Guadalcanal in July. 2/3 participated in the following World War II campaigns: *Battle of Bougainville *Battle of Guam *Battle of Iwo Jima Finally the unit was again relocated in December 1945 to Camp Pendleton, California and by the end of the month (December 31) they were deactivated. 1951–1960 During this near decade long period the unit was reactivated and went through various reassignments and non-combat deployments: * Reactivated on 20 July 1951 at Camp Pendleton, California and assigned to 3d Marine Brigade, Fleet Marine Force. * Reassigned during January 1952 to 3d Marine Division * Deployed during July–August 1953 to Camp Fuji-McNair, Japan * Redeployed during March 1957 to Camp Sukiran, Okinawa * Redeployed during March 1958 to Camp Sukiran, Okinawa * Relocated during November 1959 to Camp Pendleton, California and reassigned to 1st Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force Vietnam War (1961–1969) Marines from 2/3 in Vietnam during the Battle of Khe Sanh 2/3 Marines on the back of an M-60 tank in Vietnam in 1966In January 1961 2/3 was redeployed to Camp Schwab, Okinawa and reassigned to 3d Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force. From there the unit deployed at various times between 1961 and 1967 as the Battalion Landing Team of the Seventh Fleet. In April 1965 2/3 deployed to Da Nang in the Republic of Vietnam. They fought in Vietnam from April 1965 until October 1969, operating from: * DaNang * Camp Carroll * Quảng Trị * Cam Lộ * Dong Ha Combat Base * Khe Sanh During the night of 12 August 1965, the battalion made a night helicopter assault into the Elephant Valley south of Da Nang, shortly after Marine ground troops arrived in the country. In April 1967, 2/3 was flown to Khe Sanh and walked north up into the DMZ and participated in one of the bloodiest fights, later to be known as The Hill Fights. In October 1969, the battalion left South Vietnam and relocated to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and was reassigned to 5th Marine Amphibious Brigade, Fleet Marine Force. 1970s–1980s For this period 2/3 saw more reassignments, redesignations and relocations. * Reassigned during April 1971 to 1st Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force * Relocated during May – June 1971 to Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and reassigned to 1st Marine Brigade, Fleet Marine Force * 1st Marine Brigade redesignated 30 August 1985 as 1st Marine Amphibious Brigade * 1st Marine Amphibious Brigade redesignated 5 February 1988 as 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade The Gulf War and the 1990s In January 1991, under the command of Lt.

The battalion, which was on deployment to Okinawa, Japan, was deployed to Southwest Asia from January to April 1991, when 2/3 returned to Kaneohe Bay until their October 1994 reassignments to 3rd Marine Division. Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom 2/3 Marines in Afghanistan in late 2005 The battalion deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in the Kunar and Laghman provinces in northeastern Afghanistan in 2005–2006. During this deployment, the battalion planned and participated in Operation Red Wings and planned and carried out Operation Whalers. While Red Wings garnered a large amount of press due to the loss of 19 special operations personnel, Whalers, which was successful in defeating the target cell that inflicted the losses of Red Wings, was little reported at the time. 2/3 lost four members of the battalion during this deployment. 2/3 deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in the Haditha \\"triad\\" region of Al Anbar Province in western Iraq in 2006–2007. 2/3 faced some of the worst fighting in the entire war. They were one of the last Marine units to face combat in Al Anbar. 2/3 suffered 23 KIAs from September 2006 to April 2007 and was given the nickname of \\"The Angels of Anbar.\\" In February 2008, the battalion again deployed to Iraq, operating in the vicinity of Fallujah. On June 26, 2008, the commanding officer of 2/3, LtCol Max Galeai and two other Marines (Captain Philip J. Dykeman and Cpl. Marcus W. Preudhomme) from the battalion were killed when a suicide bomber dressed as an Iraqi policeman detonated an explosive vest at a meeting of tribal sheiks in the town of Karmah. The battalion returned from this deployment in late August/early September 2008. 2/3 Deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 (14 KIA) as part of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. They were part of the 17,000 troop increase announced by President Obama in mid-February. 2/3 returned to Marine Corps Base Hawaii late 2009, and redeployed to Afghanistan in November 2010 to Helmand province to the Nawa-I-Barakzayi District. During this deployment, due to increased security in Nawa, Fox Company was attached to 3rd Battalion 9th Marines in Marjah, during less than 6 months the Company found over 270+ weapons caches & IED's, more than any other Marine Company deployed to Afghanistan. Because it was so kinetic a PMT from 2/3 (police mentoring team) was attached to 3/5 (Sangin, Afghanistan) during the 2010 deployment. 2/3 returned from Afghanistan in June 2011. In April 2012 Fox Company was the first US military unit to begin regular training rotations through northern Australia. It is expected that eventually 2500 US Marines will be posted near Darwin, Northern Territory with the 5th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, as part of increased security ties between the two nations (See Australia–United States relations).

Mirabel-aux-Baronnies in France, department Drôme, and to the east of the former Jewish quarter called les Josiols. This quarter existed until 1348, when the inhabitants of Les Josiols were assassinated due to rumours that they had caused the outbreak of the pest in Mirabel by poisoning the wells. The Jews themselves were said not to suffer from the pest as they drank water from the creek Françonne. Françonne is also the name of the site situated east of Les Josiols, the creek passing in between. The Françonne joins the Gaude River, a contributor of the Eygues River.

He has written books and researched, written and presented television documentaries over a period of more than forty years. In 2014, Taylor was awarded both a Royal Television Society lifetime achievement award and a BAFTA special award. Early life Taylor was born in 1942 in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, and was educated at Scarborough High School for Boys, a state boys' grammar school, followed by Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he read Classics, Modern History and Social and Political Sciences. Career Taylor's career reporting on political violence began with ITV’s This Week in 1967, and continued with BBC TV’s Panorama from 1980 to 2014. His Panorama Special, The Spies Who Fooled the World, investigated the intelligence used to justify the Iraq War. He has made many authored series for BBC1 and BBC2 on the security and intelligence services and five documentary series since the 9/11 attacks on Al Qaeda and Islamist extremism, culminating in his acclaimed The Secret War on Terror to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11 which the Financial Times described as \\"a small masterpiece of clarity as to our present condition.\\" In 2015, he investigated the funding of ISIS in his programme World's Richest Terror Army. Taylor has written eight books on political violence, his latest being Talking to Terrorists. A Personal Journey from the IRA to Al Qaeda. Others include Beating the Terrorists?

Each book deals with the Northern Irish conflict from the perspective of one of the three main parties involved: the Provisional IRA; the various Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups; and the British government and security forces. The trilogy provides an insight into all the main groups involved and the violent and political events that occurred throughout this turbulent period in Anglo-Irish history. Taylor's books feature interviews with people connected to some of the most significant incidents and landmark political events in Northern Ireland during this time. In 2000, he presented the three part BBC2 series Brits on the covert war in Northern Ireland including interviews of former members of 14 Intelligence Company, the RUC Headquarters Mobile Support Unit and MI6.

Originally providing musical accompaniment to such old-time radio programs as The Adventures of Ellery Queen and Young Doctor Malone, he transitioned to television in the 1950s. His music accentuated the TV version of Martin Kane, Private Eye with an organ and horn combo. His first known soap opera was Love of Life which he began accompanying in 1953. In 1954 he added The Secret Storm and the short- lived The Road of Life to his duties. By this time Paul had perfected a style that favored the organ, but was often coupled with piano for more intense scenes. On The Secret Storm Paul began his practice of using \\"leitmotif\\" themes to underscore specific characters, such as his tune for matriarch Grace Tyrell (Marjorie Gateson) and his lament for her daughter Pauline Harris (Haila Stoddard). Paul continued this practice on Love of Life and his successive soaps. It was in 1956 that Charles Paul began a stint as the organist for television's first thirty-minute soap opera, As the World Turns. Paul created character themes for Nancy Hughes (Helen Wagner), Pa Hughes (Santos Ortega) and Lisa (Eileen Fulton). He wrote motifs for opening scene shots that identified settings, such as Memorial Hospital and the Lowell, Barnes, Lowell & Hughes law firm. Paul also wrote the first theme song for NBC's Another World which was handled by other organists. Though he was not named in the credits, Paul provided the original scores to headwriter Agnes Nixon's ABC hits One Life to Live and All My Children under the auspices of Aeolus Productions. In the summer of 1969, many behind-the-scenes shifts occurred at CBS soaps. As a result, Paul lost The Secret Storm, maintained his positions at Love of Life and As the World Turns, and assumed the keyboard duties at longtime favorite Guiding Light. By the early 1970s, however, times were changing. Paul soon lost Love of Life but transitioned both As the World Turns and Guiding Light to orchestral arrangements. He would later do likewise for NBC's relatively short-lived Somerset, ABC's successful General Hospital, and the last year of CBS's Love of Life after ten years' absence from that series. In 2009, Soapluvva established a YouTube tribute channel to both Charles Paul and Eddie Layton, who were colleagues of each other at the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan.

History Mirabel, which was first mentioned in 1059, had a flourishing Jewish quarter until 1348. The Jews that inhabited Les Josiols were merchants with flourishing businesses. In 1348, the inhabitants were either expelled or assassinated due to the accusation that they had distributed the pest. In fact, the Black Death-outbreak of 1348 followed several years of bad harvests and had made numerous victims. It was therefore that the inhabitants of Mirabel felt that somebody had to be punished. Finally the Jews were accused of having poisoned the drinking water wells of Mirabel. It has to be noted that the creek Françonne served as source of drinking water for the Jews, so they did not suffer from the poison, was the hearsay. Their houses were completely destroyed, those who resisted were murdered, the ones that fled went to Carpentras. The Dauphin of the Dauphiné (later the French department Drôme) and even the Pope intervened, but could do little to save the Jews of Mirabel.

G. Wodehouse, in alphabetical order by place name.  Angler's Rest The Angler's (or Anglers') Rest is the fictional public house frequented by irrepressible raconteur Mr Mulliner. Actually, P. G. Wodehouse gives us few details about this public house. At the beginning of each short story of the Mulliner's collection, we find Mr Mulliner sipping his hot Scotch and Lemon in the bar-parlour of the establishment, while his pub companions are drinking their own beverages. In most stories, a conversation between these companions induces Mr Mulliner to a recollection of a similar event introducing some new members of the very large Mulliner family. We then leave the pub to enter into the narrator's world. We know that the popular landlord of the place is named Ernest Biggs (\\"The Juice of an Orange\\"), and that his very amiable barmaid is named Miss Postlethwaite. Even though she appears in most of the stories, she is never given a first name, but we do know that she is very fond of motion pictures, and of romance novelettes. Every Sunday afternoon, she retires to her room with a box of caramels and a novel from the circulating library, and on the following night, she places the results of her literary researches in front of the habitués of the Angler's Rest and invites their judgment (\\"The Castaways\\"). The Angler's Rest happens to take residents for longer stay: In \\"Unpleasantness at Bludleigh Court\\", a poet is spending the summer at the place. We also know that, across the passage, there is a larger room, where they sometimes give smoking-concerts (\\"The Knightly Quest of Mervyn\\"). The Angler's Rest seems to be located in a small English town. In this town, we know there is a Bon Ton Drapery Stores in the High Street, whose efficient sales assistant is named Alfred Lukyn (\\"The Story of Cedric\\"). In the same High Street, we find a cinema named the Bijou Dream (\\"A Slice of Life\\", \\"The Nodder\\" and \\"The Rise of Minna Nordstrom\\"). The village also contains a resident doctor (\\"The Truth About George\\"), and of course a church (\\"Anselm Gets His Chance\\"), with its inevitable Choral Society (\\"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\\"). About a mile or two up the river from the Angler's Rest, stands an ancient and historic public-school (\\"The Voice from the Past\\"). In the neighbourhood of the town, there seems to be a golf course (\\"Those in Peril on the Tee\\"), and also a racecourse (\\"Gala Night\\"). Mr Mulliner's pub companions never have a real name. They are named after the beverage they are drinking. Here is a list of some of these names : Aspinall's Aspinall's is a fictional jewellery store in New Bond Street, London, and is referenced in Joy in the Morning (chapter 5), Full Moon (chapter 2), and Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (chapter 8). Aspinall's was based on Asprey's store in New Bond Street. Barribault's Hotel Barribault's Hotel is a fictional hotel in London. It is a posh, dignified establishment, and may have been modeled on Claridge's. Barribault's first appears in Full Moon, in which it is located in Brook Street. In Spring Fever, the hotel is in Duke Street. In Ice in the Bedroom, it is in Clarges Street. Bertie Wooster has lunch there with Ginger Winship in Much Obliged, Jeeves. Barribault's also features in other novels including Something Fishy and Frozen Assets.Ring & Jaggard (2000), Wodehouse with Old Friends, pp. 14–15. It is also featured in Uncle Dynamite. Beckford A fictional school, setting of the novel A Prefect's Uncle, and several short stories. Belpher A fictional small coastal-village in Hampshire, and the setting for the novel A Damsel in Distress. Belpher was once a prosperous fishing-town made famous by the Oyster trade, until it was discovered that the local bay had been polluted, thus driving away much of the tourist and fishing trade. Local points of interest mentioned in the novel include The Belpher Arms, the village tavern, and Belpher Castle, the home of the aristocratic Marshmoreton family since the Wars of the Roses. Berkeley Mansions Berkeley Mansions, Berkeley Square, London W1, is a fictional Mayfair residential building in the Jeeves stories, being the residence of Bertie Wooster. In an early story, Bertie lives at 6A, Crichton Mansions, Berkeley Street, W.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 8, p. 79. but is later residing at Berkeley Mansions in Thank You, Jeeves, though he is obliged to leave after making noise with his banjolele.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 17. Bertie apparently returns to the building, as he is residing in Berkeley Mansions in the later novel The Code of the WoostersWodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 2, p. 27. and specifies that he lives in 3A Berkeley Mansions in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit.Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 1, p. 8. In the 1979 What Ho! Jeeves radio adaptation of Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, the telephone number for Bertie's flat is Mayfair 2631 (as spoken to a telephone operator), though no telephone number is given for the flat in the original stories. In A Pelican at Blandings, Galahad Threepwood lives in Berkeley Mansions, on the fourth floor.A Pelican at Blandings (1969), chapter 2. Galahad had previously lived in a flat in Duke Street, St James's.Full Moon (1947), chapter 6, part VI. Wodehouse briefly lived in a flat in Berkeley Street in 1922, the same year that the story showing Bertie living in Berkeley Street (in Crichton Mansions), \\"Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch\\", was published.Murphy (2015), p. 76. Blandings Castle Blandings Castle is a fictional location central to many P. G. Wodehouse stories. It is an idyllic country house. Blandings Parva A small fictional hamlet near Blandings Castle. The people of the village enjoy much revelry at the annual School Treat, held on August Bank Holiday every year in the grounds of the Castle, much to Lord Emsworth's horror (not only does his garden become an inferno of children, tents and paper bags, but he is required to wear a top hat and make a speech). Blandings Parva is also known for taking in children from London in need of fresh air, such as Gladys and her brother Ern. Brinkley Court The fictional country house of Tom and Dahlia Travers, Brinkley Court is located near Market Snodsbury in Worcestershire, near Droitwich, eight miles from Pershore and about a hundred miles from London.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 41. In one instance, it takes Dahlia Travers about three hours to travel from London to Brinkley Court.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 6, p. 61. The residence of the Traverses' children Angela and Bonzo, Brinkley Court is also a popular destination for Bertie Wooster, Dahlia's beloved nephew. Brinkley's butler is named Seppings and its chauffeur Waterbury. Its most famous domestic employee is the gifted French chef Anatole.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 2, 224, 268. The Travers family also owns a house in London, located at 47 Charles Street, Berkeley Square.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 254. Brinkley Court is the primary setting of \\"The Love That Purifies\\", Right Ho, Jeeves, Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, Jeeves in the Offing, and Much Obliged, Jeeves. Jeeves works there temporarily in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves. Brinkley is said to be modeled on Severn End, Hanley Castle, in Worcestershire. In the television series Jeeves and Wooster, exterior shots of Brinkley Court were filmed at Barnsley Park, Gloucestershire in series 1 and Hall Barn, Buckinghamshire in series 4. All interior shots of Brinkley Court were filmed at Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire. The Travers family's address in London, 47 Charles Street, was the same address where Ian Hay, who collaborated with Wodehouse on three plays, lived in 1926. Bumpleigh Hall Bumpleigh Hall is a fictional location appearing in Joy in the Morning, being the Hampshire residence of Bertie Wooster's Uncle Percy (Percy Craye, Lord Worplesdon) and Aunt Agatha. It is located near the village of Steeple Bumpleigh. Usual residents include Lord Worplesdon's children Florence Craye and Edwin Craye. Chuffnell Hall Chuffnell Hall is the fictional country house of \\"Chuffy\\" Chuffnell, located near Chuffnell Regis in Somerset. The house is featured in Thank You, Jeeves.Cawthorne (2013), p. 215. Bertie Wooster stayed in the nearby cottage called Seaview Cottage, which was burnt down because of Brinkley.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 222. Chuffnell Regis Chuffnell Regis is a fictional village featured in Thank You, Jeeves. The nearest village to Chuffnell Hall, it is located in Somerset (\\"Somersetshire\\" in the novel). In the village is the Seaview Hotel, which has the telephone number Chuffnell Regis 294.Ring & Jaggard (1999),Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 224. Corven Abbey See Dreever Castle below.  Demosthenes Club The Demosthenes Club is a fictional gentlemen's club in Cocktail Time and Ice in the Bedroom. A respectable and dignified institution, it is located across the street from the more boisterous Drones Club. Members of the Demosthenes include Sir Roderick Glossop and John Shoesmith, Freddie Widgeon's employer.Ring & Jaggard (2000), Wodehouse with Old Friends, p. 80. It was based on the Athenaeum Club in London.Murphy (2015), p. 84. Deverill Hall Deverill Hall is a fictional country house with Tudor architecture, located in Hampshire, in the village of King's Deverill. The setting of The Mating Season, Deverill Hall is the residence of Esmond Haddock, Dame Daphne Winkworth, and her sisters, Emmeline, Charlotte, Myrtle and Harriet,Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 222–223. as well as Dame Daphne Winkworth's daughter Gertrude.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 280–281. Jeeves's uncle Charlie Silversmith is butler at Deverill, and Silversmith's daughter Queenie is the parlourmaid there.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 230. In the Jeeves and Wooster television series, Deverill Hall was filmed at Joyce Grove. Ditteredge Hall Ditteredge Hall is the fictional residence of the family of Sir Roderick Glossop in Hampshire in \\"Scoring off Jeeves\\".Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 74. Dreever Castle The fictional setting of much of A Gentleman of Leisure, Dreever is a large old place in Shropshire, with heavy grey walls to defend against Welsh marauders, but a comfortable interior. It is owned by Spennie, Lord Dreever, but run by his rich uncle Sir Thomas Blunt. One of the oldest and grandest houses in England, Dreever is famed for an old ghost story, handed down from generation to generation. There is a picturesque rose-garden, and a lake with an island, ideal for young lovers. In The Gem Collector, an earlier version of the story, the house is called Corven Abbey, and owned by former New York policeman McEachern.  Drones Club The Drones Club is a fictional gentlemen's club for feckless youth, located in Dover Street, London. Easeby Hall Easeby Hall is the fictional Shropshire seat of Bertie Wooster's Uncle Willoughby in \\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\".Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 77 Eckleton A fictional school, setting of the novel The Head of Kay's, and several other school stories.  Emsworth Arms A fictional inn on the High Street in Market Blandings, the Emsworth serves fine ale and makes an ideal meeting-place for conspirators not wishing to be overheard, as well as providing accommodation for anyone wishing to be near Blandings Castle but lacking an invitation. There is a busy bar downstairs, and a more genteel dining-room on the first floor, with comfortable armchairs ideal for anyone in need of a nap. The garden stretches down to the river, with many shady nooks and summer-house, seemingly ideal for conspirators not wishing to be overheard and weary minds and bodies needing rest. The proprietor, G. Ovens, makes excellent home-brewed ale. Halsey Court Halsey Court is a fictional London cul-de-sac that is not fashionable despite being located in Mayfair. It is featured in several stories, including Galahad at Blandings, Money in the Bank, and Frozen Assets.Ring & Jaggard (2000), Wodehouse with Old Friends, p. 130 In Frozen Assets, Halsey Court is said to be located just round the corner from Barribault's.Frozen Assets (1964), chapter 3. Heath House The fictional home of Ukridge's Aunt Julia, Heath House is a large mansion near Wimbledon Common, set back from the road in the seclusion of spacious grounds. Ukridge lives there from time to time, in between being thrown out by his aunt for his misdeeds. The grounds are in much demand for dancing societies and charitable fetes. Among the staff of the house have been, at times, the likes of Oakshott the butler, and \\"Battling\\" Billson, a temporary handyman, and Jimmy Corcoran is rarely welcome there. The house is occasionally called \\"The Cedars\\" in later stories. Ickenham Hall The fictional Hampshire seat of Frederick Twistleton, Lord Ickenham, where he lives much of the time, his wife Lady Jane having forbidden him to visit London lest he wreak his usual havoc. Polly Pott gambolled in the grounds as a child; there are too many statues there.  Junior Ganymede Club The Junior Ganymede Club is a fictional club for valets and butlers, of which Jeeves is a member. The club is located in Curzon Street in Mayfair, as stated in three novels and one short story.The Code of the Woosters (chapter 5), Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (chapter 1), \\"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\\", and Much Obliged, Jeeves (chapter 1). In Much Obliged, Jeeves, while Bertie and Jeeves are in Curzon Street, Jeeves says that the club is \\"just round the corner\\".Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 34. (Curzon Street is not straight, so the club could be \\"round the corner\\" and still on the same street.) Aside from socializing, the club's main activities are bridge and the writing and perusal of the club book, which has been in existence for more than eighty years and has reached its twelfth volume.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 141–142. According to Rule Eleven of the club's constitution, every member must record information about their employers in the club book. Information in the club book about Roderick Spode proves crucial in The Code of the Woosters. The club book was said to have eleven pages on Bertie Wooster. The total eventually ballooned to eighteen pages, before Jeeves agrees to destroy the pages on Bertie in Much Obliged, Jeeves.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 61. A monthly luncheon is held at the Junior Ganymede. Jeeves is asked to chair the luncheon, which entails delivering a speech, in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit.Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 8, pp 76–77. Bertie visits the club in Much Obliged, Jeeves. He is not surprised that Jeeves spends so much time there, noting that the Junior Ganymede, while lacking the sprightliness of the Drones Club, is a very cosy and comfortable establishment.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 4, pp 35–36. It appears that members are not required to resign after relinquishing their positions in service, since one valet, Bingley, retains his membership after retiring. According to Wodehouse scholar Norman Murphy, the club was inspired by a pub that was frequented by butlers, valets, and other servants in Mayfair in the 1920s, located in Charles Street (not far from the eastern end of Curzon Street). The pub is now named The Only Running Footman, or The Footman for short.Murphy (2015), pp. 87–89. King's Deverill King's Deverill is a fictional village near Deverill Hall. The village is featured in The Mating Season.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 144. Malvern House Preparatory School Malvern House Preparatory School is the preparatory school at Bramley-on-Sea where Bertie Wooster, Kipper Herring, Bingo Little, Freddie Widgeon, Gussie Fink-Nottle and Catsmeat Potter- Pirbright studied in their earlier years.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 160–161. During their education, the school was presided over by the Rev. Aubrey Upjohn. The name comes from the real school which P. G. Wodehouse attended from 1891 to 1893.  Mammoth Publishing Company A fictional company owned and run by Lord Tilbury, the Mammoth is based at Tilbury House, Tilbury Street (off Fleet Street). The company's output is large and varied, from the gossipy Society Spice to the children's Tiny Tots, and includes newspapers such as the Daily Record, magazines like Home Gossip, and book imprints like the British Pluck Library, home to the adventures of Gridley Quayle, Investigator. Employees at various times include Tilbury's timid son Roderick, briefly editor of Society Spice, Percy Pilbeam, Roderick's capable assistant who later takes over as editor, Ashe Marson, the writer of the Gridley Quayle stories, Joan Valentine, sometime editor of Home Gossip, and Sam Shotter, who worked for his neighbour Mr Wrenn, editor of Pyke's Home Companion. Monty Bodkin is deputy-editor of Tiny Tots at the start of Heavy Weather, thanks to his uncle Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe meeting with Tilbury at a public dinner; Archie Gilpin was an occasional contributor. Lavender Briggs and Millicent Rigby have both acted as Tilbury's secretary. Mario's Restaurant A fictional restaurant appearing in several novels, including Bill the Conqueror, Summer Lightning, and Big Money.Ring & Jaggard (2000), Wodehouse with Old Friends, p. 176. Mario's was inspired by the Café de Paris. According to Richard Usborne, Bill the Conqueror was Wodehouse's first novel to feature Mario's Restaurant, \\"where Society dines and has fracas and where – as at the old Café de Paris – diners downstairs (Must Dress) cannot see the diners upstairs (Needn't Dress) who can see them\\".Usborne (2003), p. 158. Market Blandings Market Blandings is a fictional town, being the closest town to Blandings Castle. It is the site of the Emsworth Arms and a host of other hostelries (such as the Beetle and Wedge, the Blue Boar, the Blue Cow, the Blue Dragon, the Cow and Grasshopper, the Goat and Feathers, the Goose and Gander, the Jolly Cricketers, the Stitch in Time, the Wheatsheaf, and the Waggoner's Rest), as well as a useful railway station, from where a fast train can get you to Paddington in under four hours. A sleepy old place, Market Blandings is one of England's most picturesque towns, and has an air of having been the same for centuries; the lichened church has a four-square tower, the shops red roofs, and the upper floors of the inns bulge comfortably outward. The most modern thing there is the moving-picture house, which calls itself an \\"Electric Theatre\\", is covered in ivy and features stone gables; the only other up-to-date location is the shop of Jno. Banks, hairdresser. The only taxi cab in town is the station taxi, driven by Mr Jno. Robinson; the chemist's is run by a Mr Bulstrode. Market Snodsbury Market Snodsbury is a fictional town, about two miles from Brinkley Court and near Droitwich. It is at the Market Snodsbury Grammar School that, in Right Ho, Jeeves, Gussie Fink- Nottle gives his immortal drunken prize-giving speech. Market Snodsbury is also home to an inn called the Bull and Bush, which is praised highly in the Automobile Guide and to which Aubrey Upjohn went to stay in Jeeves in the Offing.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 46. Marling Hall A fictional house in the neighbourhood of Blandings Castle, Marling is the home of Colonel Fanshawe, his wife and their attractive daughter Valerie. The butler there is a friend of Beach, and the two of them occasionally share a glass or two in the evenings. The house's coal cellar has, on at least one occasion, served as a makeshift prison. Marvis Bay Marvis Bay is a fictional coastal resort, with smooth firm sands and a long pier at the northern end of the beach, which provides excellent fishing. The Beach View Hotel lies just by the beach, and the Beach Theatre is not far away. Marvis is the peaceful seaside spot par excellence, the ideal place for a quiet week for those not up to the excitements of Roville The beach is the main setting for the events of \\"Deep Waters\\" and \\"Fixing it for Freddie\\", while Marvis Bay Golf and Country Club has a charming links and a comfortable clubhouse, from where the club's Oldest Member dispenses his wisdom in the form of his inexhaustible golf stories. Marvis Bay is variously reported to lie in Dorsetshire (\\"Fixing it for Freddie\\")Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 169 and Cornwall (Uneasy Money). Matchingham Hall Matchingham Hall is a fictional location, being the seat of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe. The hall neighbours Blandings Castle and lies near the village of Much Matchingham. In its grounds resides the \\"Pride of Matchingham\\", Sir Gregory's pig and rival to Lord Emsworth's mighty Empress of Blandings, and later the \\"Queen of Matchingham\\", replacement for the Pride. The telephone number there is Matchingham 8-3. Mervo A small fictional Mediterranean island, Mervo is the smallest independent state in the world, smaller even than Monaco. It is mentioned that \\"Jason went there in search of the Golden Fleece\\", which would place Mervo in the northern Aegean Sea. It is a sleepy little place, with an army of one hundred and fifteen, a small harbour, a small town and a few scattered fishing hamlets. The last prince, Charles, was driven out in 1886, when the place became a republic, but when Mervo is purchased by Benjamin Scobell in order to build a casino and resort, in The Prince and Betty, John Maude is revealed to be heir to the princedom. Much Matchingham The fictional village adjacent to Matchingham Hall. \\"Beefy\\" Bingham inhabits the Vicarage there, the living being in the grant of Lord Emsworth, and his dog Bottles is well known from the Blue Boar on the High Street to the distant Cow and Caterpillar on the Shrewsbury Road. Much Middlefold A fictional village located in Shropshire, similar in name to the real town Much Wenlock. It is the home of cricket enthusiast Joan Romney in five short stories published between 1905 and 1909, of Wilmot \\"Motty\\", Lord Pershore, in \\"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\\", and of Bruce Carmyle in The Adventures of Sally. It is also the birthplace of Jeremy Garnet in Love Among the Chickens (spelled Much Middleford in some editions), Ashe Marson in Something Fresh, and Sally Fitch in Bachelors Anonymous. Psmith is from Corfby Hall, near Much Middleford, in Leave it to Psmith. See editors' notes. Much-Middlefold-on-the-Hill and Lesser-Middlefold-in-the-Vale are located near Beckford College in A Prefect's Uncle. The prefect of the title, Alan Gethryn, is recruited to play cricket for Much Middlefold in the Joan Romney story \\"Personally Conducted\\".  New Asiatic Bank A fictional organisation, the austere and serious New Asiatic is run by John Bickersdyke. Former employees include Mike Jackson and Psmith, employed there for a spell in Psmith in the City. It has the atmosphere of a public school, with the heads of department as autocratic as masters - the Postage Dept. is run by Mr Rossiter, the Cash Dept. by Mr Waller, and the Fixed Deposits Department by a Mr Gregory. The London branch is seen as something of a training ground for new blood - once a period of probation has been completed, most employees head out East. At some point, the bank was successfully robbed of around two million dollars' worth of transferable bonds, by a man by the name of Edward Finglass, a friend of Alexander \\"Chimp\\" Twist and Thomas \\"Soapy\\" Molloy; though Finglass escaped, his haul was eventually recovered, thanks to Sam Shotter, in Sam the Sudden. On another occasion, a Mr John Benyon robbed the bank of $100,000, according to a story in The Man with Two Left Feet. The bank is perhaps inspired by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, where Wodehouse himself worked for a time before his writing career took off, and is mentioned in passing in many other stories and novels. It is described in the chapter 4 of Psmith in the City that the London branch of the New Asiatic Bank is situated somewhere around the Mansion House and Queen Victoria St in the City of London.  Pelican Club A riotous gentlemen's club back in the 1890s, the Pelican was that happy era's equivalent to the Drones. Galahad Threepwood and Uncle Fred were both prominent and popular members; others include \\"Dogface\\" Weeks, champion liar, and Galahad's friends \\"Plug\\" Basham and \\"Puffy\\" Benger. The club was a real gentlemen's club of the era from 1887–1892. Pen and Ink Club The Pen and Ink Club is a fictional club for writers referenced in several stories, including the 1916 novel Uneasy Money (chapter 2) and the 1961 novel Ice in the Bedroom (chapter 10), as well as the short story \\"Mr Potter Takes a Rest Cure\\". Ukridge's Aunt Julia is president of the club, and it is featured in several Ukridge stories such as \\"Ukridge Sees Her Through\\". Rosie M. Banks appears to be a member, since she attends the club's annual dinner in the Drones Club story \\"Leave it to Algy\\". Wodehouse may have drawn inspiration for the club from the Authors' Club, since he played cricket for its associated cricket team, the Authors XI. According to Wodehouse scholar Norman Murphy, the writers association PEN International may have been a source of inspiration for the club. Wodehouse references this organization in his 1971 novel The Girl in Blue, in which amateur poet Homer Pyle attends a PEN conference in Brussels. The first PEN Club was founded in London in 1921; the Pen and Ink Club debuted before this in Uneasy Money but is developed further in later appearances. Roville-sur-Mer Roville-sur-Mer is a fictional resort in Northern France, 'in Picardy' (French Leave) and the setting of the likes of The Adventures of Sally and French Leave; the name, however, is reminiscent of Deauville and Boulogne-sur-Mer, on the Channel. It first appeared in two of the short stories collected in the book The Man Upstairs, published in the U.K. in 1914: Ruth in Exile and The Tuppenny Millionaire. It also appears in the short story, \\"Aunt Agatha Takes the Count\\" (in The Inimitable Jeeves).Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 216–217. Rowcester Abbey Rowcester Abbey is the fictional 147-room home of impoverished aristocrat Bill Belfry, Lord Rowcester. The abbey is the setting for the novel Ring for Jeeves. The abbey dates as far back as the thirteenth century, around the time of Sir Caradoc Belfry, with fifteenth century and Tudor additions, and is alleged to be haunted by the ghost of Lady Agatha, who was Sir Caradoc Belfry's spouse. In the 1950s, the house has fallen into disrepair. Bill manages to sell the house to Rosalinda Spottsworth, who planned to take it down and reconstruct it in California.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 217–218. Rowcester Abbey is located in the fictional county of Southmoltonshire, though in early editions it was the real Northamptonshire. The name was apparently changed due to a complaint from the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire over objections to one of the novel's characters, Colonel Wyvern.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, pp. 236. Sanstead House Sanstead is a fictional school, setting for much of the action in The Little Nugget. An imposing Georgian building in around of land, Sanstead was formerly the private home of a family called Boone, but when the family's fortunes declined and the house became too large and expensive to maintain, one Colonel Boone keenly leased the place out as a school. The place is perfect for the purpose, with ample grounds for cricket and football, and plenty of rooms of various sizes ideal for classrooms and dormitories. Its stables, with their thick walls and iron-barred windows, have been put to use as a gymnasium, carpenter's shop and general storage area, but also make a handy fortress in event of a siege. It is two miles (3 km) from the village, where the principal watering-hole is the Feathers, the barmaid of which, a Miss Benjafield, is a stately type who disapproves of Americans. Run by the somewhat ineffectual Arnold Abney, Sanstead's staff includes the gloomy teacher Mr Glossop, White the smooth mannered butler, and Mrs Attwell the Matron, as well as a cook, an odd-job-man, two housemaids, a scullery-maid and a parlour-maid, before it is enhanced by the arrival of Peter Burns. The boys, who number some twenty-four in total, include Augustus Beckford, are augmented by the Nugget himself, Ogden Ford, who brings all manner of drama and bad behaviour to the school. Sedleigh A fictional, very minor school, which achieves some cricketing success thanks to the arrival of Mike Jackson and Psmith, in Mike and Psmith. Set in pretty countryside, the school has some two hundred boys. The houses, a row of three, lie across the cricket field from the main school; Outwood's, of which Mike and Psmith become members, is the middle one. The school has a thriving archaeological society, thanks to Outwood, and also a fire brigade, run by his colleague Downing but treated as an excuse to mess around by the boys. The drainpipes are sturdy, and there is a fire bell, in an archway near the school, which proves useful to Mike on one occasion; when it is rung, the boys get to flee the building via canvas chutes.  Senior Conservative Club A fictional gentlemen's club, the Senior Conservative Club is staid and old-fashioned. The Senior Conservative is a calm and quiet place with discreet staff and excellent dining. Opposite the wide windows of the lower smoking-room is an excellent flower shop, and there is a Turkish bath not twenty-five yards from the doors, in Cumberland Street. Its numbers (increasing from three thousand, seven hundred and eighteen at the time of Psmith in the City to six thousand, one hundred and eleven by the time of Leave it to Psmith) are all respectable, mostly bald men, who look like they could be politicians or important figures in the City; they include Lord Emsworth, who joined as a country member in 1888, and Psmith, put up for the club by his father. It was based on the Constitutional Club, a London club which has since been dissolved. Wodehouse was a member of a number of London and New York clubs at various times, including the Constitutional Club.  Senior Liberal Club A fictional gentlemen's club, the Senior Liberal Club is where Bertie Wooster and Bingo Little dine while the Drones Club is closed for cleaning in \\"Bingo and the Little Woman\\" (in The Inimitable Jeeves).Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 195. St. Austin's A fictional public school, setting of several early shorts (many of them collected in Tales of St. Austin's), as well as Wodehouse's first published novel The Pothunters. In the Jeeves short story \\"The Ordeal of Young Tuppy\\", it is revealed that Tuppy Glossop is an Old Austinian. Steeple Bumpleigh Steeple Bumpleigh is a fictional location, being a small village in rural Hampshire and the location of Bumpleigh Hall.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 240. It is near the market town of East Wibley, where a fancy dress dance is held in Joy in the Morning. In Much Obliged, Jeeves, Bertie states that Steeple Bumpleigh is in Essex instead,Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 3, p. 21 perhaps because of the real Steeple Bumpstead. Tilbury House The fictional home of the Mammoth Publishing Company lies on Tilbury Lane near Fleet Street, a narrow lane that smells somewhat of cabbage. The Mammoth's premises spill out from the main HQ at Tilbury House to various other buildings in the street. For a time, opposite Tilbury House on the fourth floor are the offices of J. Sheringham Adair, Detective, also known as Alexander \\"Chimp\\" Twist. Totleigh Towers Totleigh Towers is a fictional location in two Jeeves stories, being the setting of The Code of the Woosters and Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves. The country house of Sir Watkyn Bassett, Totleigh Towers is located in Totleigh-in-the- Wold, Gloucestershire.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 250. Sir Watkyn's daughter Madeline Bassett also resides there. The butler at Totleigh is Butterfield.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 47. The house is initially the residence of Sir Watkyn's niece and ward Stiffy Byng, and is frequently visited by Sir Watkyn's friend Roderick Spode. When he first appears in the stories, Harold Pinker is the curate of Totleigh-in-the- Wold. Constable Oates is the local police officer. In the television series Jeeves and Wooster, Totleigh Towers was filmed at Highclere Castle. Totleigh Towers plays a larger role in the television series than in the original Jeeves canon, as it is used as a setting more frequently. In the television series, Totleigh is used as the setting for episodes adapting some of the events of \\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\", The Mating Season, and Much Obliged, Jeeves, though these stories originally had different settings (Easeby Hall, Deverill Hall, and Brinkley Court, respectively). Twing Hall Twing Hall is the fictional Gloucestershire home of Lord Wickhammersley in \\"The Great Sermon Handicap\\", \\"The Purity of the Turf\\", and \\"The Metropolitan Touch\\".Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 258. Valley Fields A fictional suburb in London. Valley Fields is one of London's quiet, leafy suburbs, in the SE21 postal district. The setting of much of Sam the Sudden, it is home to Matthew Wrenn, whose friend Mr Cornelius is the local estate agent and historian; he has many a tale to tell of the suburb, the most exciting being that of Edward \\"Finky\\" Finglass, the notorious bank robber, who lived for a time in the house later inhabited by Sam Shotter. In Uncle Fred in the Springtime, we learn that part of the suburb was formed from the old estate of Lord Ickenham's Uncle Willoughby, known as Mitching Hill, setting of the drama related in \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\". It is also home to Maudie, niece of Blandings Castle butler Beach. The suburb is a setting in many non-series novels, including Ice in the Bedroom, which has a similar plot to that of Sam the Sudden. In the preface to the 1972 edition of Sam the Sudden, Wodehouse wrote: \\"It was the first thing of mine where the action took place in the delectable suburb of Valley Fields, a thin disguise for the Dulwich where so many of my happiest hours have been spent.\\" In his youth, Wodehouse attended Dulwich College in the London suburb of West Dulwich. Wee Nooke The name Wee Nooke was given to two different fictional cottages that Bertie Wooster stays in. The first Wee Nooke, located in Steeple Bumpleigh, appeared in Joy in the Morning, though this cottage was destroyed by Edwin Craye. The second Wee Nooke, located in the town of Maiden Eggesford, appears in Aunts Aren't Gentlemen.Ring & Jaggard (1999), Wodehouse in Woostershire, p. 270. Wrykyn A fictional minor public school with a strong cricketing tradition, Wrykyn is most closely associated with Mike Jackson, hero of Mike at Wrykyn. It also features in the earlier school novels The Gold Bat and The White Feather, as well as a number of early school shorts. The school is an imposing place, especially to new boys; the grounds are in the form of a series of terraces cut from a hill, with the school at the top, training grounds on the next step and on the next the cricket field, from the pavilion of which one can see three counties. The houses are run by the likes of Wain, Donaldson and Seymour, and the school's reputation for cricket is fearsome. The public schools \\"Geddington\\" and \\"Ripton\\" are sporting rivals. Many characters in later works are old boys, including Ukridge, his friends Jimmy Corcoran, George Tupper, and \\"Looney\\" Coote, as well as Sam \\"The Sudden\\" Shotter and his friend Willoughby Braddock.

Along with the eared quetzal, it is the most poleward-occurring species of trogon in the world, ranging from Guatemala in the south as far north as the upper Gila River in Arizona and New Mexico. The most northerly populations of subspecies ambiguus are partially migratory,Elegant Trogon at Encyclopedia of Life and the species is occasionally found as a vagrant in southeasternmost and western Texas. It is a resident of the lower levels of semi-arid open woodlands and forests. It nests high in an unlined shallow cavity, usually selecting an old woodpecker hole, with a typical clutch of 2–3 eggs.  Description  This species is long and weighs (average ). Like other trogons, elegant trogons have distinctive male and female plumages (sexual dimorphism), with soft feathers. Both sexes have a white undertail with fine horizontal black barring. The undertail also has large white tips spaced evenly ending in a black terminal band. Both have a yellow bill, orange-red undertail coverts and lower belly, and a white horizontal breast stripe. Female The male elegant trogon has a metallic deep green head, upper breast and back, black face and throat, and red-orange lower breast and belly. He shows grey upperwing coverts. The female has a metallic bronze head, upper breast, back, upper tail and upperwing coverts. She shows a dull white upper belly, and a small white vertical stripe behind the eye. The usual call is a croaking \\"co-ah co-ah co-ah\\". The trogon will also include some chattering notes. The elegant trogon is listed as endangered in the state of New Mexico. It prefers to live in conditions that would favor the presence of pineoak woodlands and local water making it particularly susceptible to disturbance.  Diet  Elegant trogons feed on insects and fruit, often taken in flight. Their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless.

He dropped out after a year to play in a rock band for two years, then worked on communal organic farms in North Carolina, France, Spain, and Portugal. He lived for a year in a housing cooperative in Chicago, and later became associated with the Arab-Jewish Peace Alliance in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he came into contact with the ISM. Shortly thereafter, in January 2003, he traveled to the West Bank to participate in ISM protests against Israel. Shooting incident In a February 2005 interview, he said: :[W]e weren't two blocks from our apartment when an Israeli convoy of two vehicles, a tank and an armored personnel carrier, drove up the street from the direction that we were walking from. And so as we heard them coming closer, we stepped off to the side of the road to let them pass by, which was again, you know, a very, very typical situation for us to encounter the soldiers, even during the curfew, and for them just to pass on by ... And so we stood to the side of the road, we put our hands out to show we didn't have any weapons and weren't, you know, threatening them in any way. And I was wearing a fluorescent vest to, you know, try to make ourselves as visible as possible. And once they drove within about 30 meters of where we were standing, they opened fire with their machine guns and continued shooting for a very long time, probably shooting about, you know, 30 rounds of ammunition, which is quite a lot when you see them in action. And I was struck in the face with one of the bullets and, you know, was knocked to the ground immediately.http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/02/25/1455249 Avery was hit in the face, his cheek was torn and his eye socket and jaw bones were smashed. The bullet entered at his right tear duct, completely destroying his nasal bone, and exiting his left cheek. His lower left jaw had been sheared in half, and he lost half the teeth on the top left side of his mouth. After three months of hospitalization, Avery found that he would still hear an echo in his skull whenever he spoke. He was left without a sense of smell, or the ability to breathe through his nose. In the first year subsequent to the incident, he endured over six rounds of surgery in which bone was removed from his skull to help reconstruct his face. Because he did not have (affordable) health insurance, being shot in the face created an enormous financial burden for his family. According to The Jerusalem Post (9/20/07; 11/19/08), Brian and his associates were \\"wearing red reflector vests with the word \\"doctor\\" in English and Arabic.\\" The army refused to order a formal investigation of the incident, since that their probe found that no soldiers on patrol in the area that night reported such an incident as it was described by the four witnesses.\\"Wounded activist testifies against IDF\\". The Jerusalem Post, 20th Sept 2007. Israeli Supreme Court hearing Avery appeared before the Israeli Supreme Court on February 28, 2005 to request a criminal investigation into his shooting. He accused Israeli troops of shooting him without provocation. The court responded by ordering the military to reopen Avery's case. Avery's attorney, Michael Sfard, said that the ruling \\"shows the military that even internal inquiries should be managed professionally and with care to get testimony from all sides, not just from military,\\" and that it \\"coerces the military to change its stand on things. This is definitely not usual.\\" Out- of-court settlement In November 2008, Avery accepted a settlement for NIS 600,000 (USD $150,000) from the state of Israel in exchange for dropping the lawsuit. According to Shlomo Lecker, his Israeli lawyer, \\"The sum does not reflect the injuries Avery suffered... On the other hand, it's one of the very few times the state has awarded damages to anyone hurt by the IDF during the Second Intifada.\\" Lecker said that Avery was willing to settle because of the need to defray some of the costs of the reconstructive operations he must still undergo, in addition to skepticism that the 15-month-long investigation would ever reach a satisfactory conclusion.

Members of this genus are marine coastal fishes except for S. otophorus, which also occurs in brackish water. These fish are known by the names of damselfish, gregory and major. They are small tropical fish associated with coral and rocky reefs in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. They are sometimes found in the aquarium trade where they are an easy-to-keep fish, but they do not mix well with other fish of their own or other species because of their territorial habits and aggressiveness. Description The largest species in the genus is S. acapulcoensis, which grows to a maximum length of , while the smallest is S. pictus at . Members of this genus are deep-bodied and laterally flattened fish with forked tails. The head has a blunt snout, a small, terminal mouth, a nostril on each side of the face, and large eyes. The lateral line does not run the full length of the body and has gaps in it. A single large dorsal fin is present and the anal fin has two, or rarely three, spines. The colour varies with the species and sometimes varies in different parts of the fish's range. Juvenile fish tend to have bright colours which are completely different from the appearance of adults of that species. Behaviour These damselfish feed on filamentous algae which make up about 90% of their diet, although they may consume detritus and some invertebrate material, possibly ingesting it accidentally with the algae. They are territorial and cultivate the algae, guarding their garden from other fish. Most species of Stegastes live a solitary existence, though some live in association with a member of the opposite sex and a few form loose aggregations of a small number of individuals. They tend not to face too much competition from other fish because of the very shallow water in which they live and because their habitat is not actually on reefs, but is near them, among boulders, dead branching corals, man-made structures, and junk. Most species are very aggressive and attack anything that moves into their territory, including nipping divers to drive them away. Their behaviour changes somewhat during the breeding season. The male prepares a nesting site by cleaning a smooth piece of rock, removing algae and debris, and removing or driving away from the vicinity unwanted invertebrates such as starfish and sea urchins. He then signals his readiness to breed by changing hue and displaying his brighter colours. A female that accepts his advances lays a single layer of eggs which she attaches to the prepared rock. The male fertilises them and then stays to guard them, removing any debris that lands on them or unfertilised eggs and fanning the developing embryos with his fins to keep them well oxygenated. The eggs hatch in about a week, the larvae drifting away as part of the plankton. About a month later, they settle to the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles, well away from the territories occupied by the adults. In the aquarium Stegastes species may be offered to new aquarists on the grounds that they are easy to care for. They will indeed tolerate poor water quality and feed on the algae which is often a nuisance in reef tanks, but because of their aggressive behaviour, they should not be kept with other fish, especially smaller ones.

The village was popular with tourists as it was the location of a border market which straddles both sides of the border. However, it has lost it popularity following the discovery of mass graves of the victims of human trafficking in the area in 2015, for which it is now known for. It is also the location of a minor border crossing into Thailand. Geography Wang Kelian is located in the northern part of the Malaysian state of Perlis, and is one of the northernmost villages in Peninsular Malaysia. Wang Kelian is located at the foot of the Nakawan Range and is surrounded by hills, with many limestone outcrops. Coming from Kaki Bukit and the rest of Perlis, Road R15 has to climb over a low pass to reach Wang Kelian. Malaysian state Road R15 connects Wang Kelian with the rest of Perlis via the small town of Kaki Bukit about 10 km south. The border crossing into Thailand is located about 4 km north of Wang Kelian village. Padang Besar, where Perlis' main border crossing into Thailand is located, is 20 km away while Kangar, the state capital, is 33 km to the south. At the border crossing, Road R15 connects to Route 4184 which joins Route 406, the main road to Satun town. Attractions=Border market The village was a popular destinations for tourists and locals, because there is a huge market on both sides of the border. The governments of Malaysia and Thailand allow people to move freely across the border to shop within the confines of the market without the need for any documents. Malaysians need to produce their identification card to cross border while Thai nationals can cross without any documentation. Document-free visitors are confined to 1 km radius from the border crossing.http://www.imi.gov.my/bm/perkhidmatan/im_FreeFlow.asp The popularity of the market however took a hit as the Malaysian government tightened border crossing procedures following the discovery of mass graves of the victims of human trafficking and illegal transit camps in the nearby jungles in 2015. In April that year, the Malaysian government stopped the free flow of cross- border visitors as this was reportedly exploited by the human traffickers to bring the victims into Malaysia from Thailand. Perlis State Park Wang Kelian is usually used as a base for visits to the Perlis State Park. Border crossing Wang Kelian is also the location of one of two border crossings between Malaysia and Thailand in the state of Perlis, with the other one at Padang Besar. The village across the border from Wang Kelian is Wang Prachan in Khuan Don District, Satun province, Southern Thailand where the immigration checkpoint is located. A small duty free shop is located beside the immigration checkpoint. Wang Kelian Mass Graves In 2015, mass graves of people believed to be Rohingyas who were victims of human trafficking were discovered in jungles north Wang Kelian in an area called Wang Burma. Reports stated that as many as 139 graves and 29 illegal detention camps were discovered during operations carried out by the Malaysia police. Conflicting reports have emerged as to when the Malaysian police had knowledge of the camps and accusations of a cover up by the police have also been made as reports emerged that the camps were destroyed before investigations were completed. A Royal Commission of Inquiry has been set up by the Malaysian government and is still in progress as of July 2019.

Brandsma was vehemently opposed to Nazi ideology and spoke out against it many times before the Second World War. He was imprisoned in the infamous Dachau concentration camp, where he was murdered. He has been beatified by the Roman Catholic Church as a martyr of the faith. Early life Brandsma was born Anno Sjoerd Brandsma to Titus Brandsma (died 1920) and his wife Tjitsje Postma (died 1933) at Oegeklooster, near Hartwerd, in the Province of Friesland, in 1881. His parents, who ran a small dairy farm, were devout and committed Catholics, a minority in a predominantly-Calvinist region. With the exception of one daughter, all of their children (three daughters and two sons) entered religious orders. The grounds of the Franciscan friary in Megen where Brandsma did his high school studies From the age of 11, Brandsma pursued his secondary studies in the town of Megen, at a Franciscan-run minor seminary for boys considering a priestly or religious vocation. Carmelite friar Brandsma entered the novitiate of the Carmelite friars in Boxmeer on 17 September 1898, where he took the religious name Titus (in honor of his father) by which he is now known. He professed his first vows in October 1899. Ordained a priest in 1905, Brandsma was knowledgeable in Carmelite mysticism and was awarded a doctorate of philosophy at Rome in 1909. From 1909 to 1923 he lived in Oss and worked as a writer and teacher. From 1916 on, he initiated and led a project to translate the works of Teresa of Ávila into Dutch.Rees, Joseph.Titus Brandsma: A Modern Martyr. 49–50. In 1919 he founded and for two years acted as head of a secondary school in Oss—the present day Titus Brandsma Lyceum. In 1921 Brandsma worked to resolve a controversy concerning Belgian artist Albert Servaes' depiction of the Stations of the Cross. From this came his series of meditations on each of the 14 stations. One of the founders of the Catholic University of Nijmegen (now Radboud University), Brandsma became a professor of philosophy and the history of mysticism at the school in 1923. He later served as Rector Magnificus (1932–33). He was noted for his constant availability to everyone, rather than for his scholarly work as a professor. Brandsma also worked as a journalist and was the ecclesiastical adviser to Catholic journalists by 1935. That same year he traveled for a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, speaking at various institutions of his Order. On the occasion of his visit to a Carmelite seminary in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Brandsma wrote of the falls, \\"I not only see the riches of the nature of the water, its immeasurable potentiality; I see God working in the work of his hands and the manifestation of his love.\\" Imprisonment and death After the invasion of the Netherlands by the Third Reich in May 1940, Brandsma's long-term fight against the spread of Nazi ideology and for educational and press freedom brought him to the attention of the Nazis. In January 1942 he undertook to deliver by hand a letter from the Conference of Dutch Bishops to the editors of Catholic newspapers in which the bishops ordered them not to print official Nazi documents, as was required under a new law by the German occupiers. He had visited fourteen editors before being arrested on 19 January at the Boxmeer monastery. After being held prisoner in Scheveningen, Amersfoort, and Cleves, Brandsma was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp, arriving there on 19 June. His health quickly gave way, and he was transferred to the camp hospital. He died on 26 July 1942, from a lethal injection administered by a nurseButler, Alban. Butler's Lives of the Saints.

Legacy Statue of Titus Brandsma on the grounds of Radboud University, Nijmegen Brandsma is honored as a martyr within the Roman Catholic Church. He was beatified in November 1985 by Pope John Paul II. His feast day is observed within the Carmelite Order on 27 July. In 2005 Brandsma was chosen by the inhabitants of Nijmegen as the greatest citizen to have lived there. A memorial church now stands in the city dedicated to him. 210px Brandsma's studies on mysticism was the basis for the establishment in 1968 of the Titus Brandsma Institute in Nijmegen, dedicated to the study of spirituality. It is a collaboration between the Dutch Carmelite friars and Radboud University Nijmegen. In his biography of Brandsma, The Man behind the Myth, Dutch journalist Ton Crijnen claims that Brandsma's character consisted of some vanity, a short temper, extreme energy, political innocence, true charity, unpretentious piety, thorough decisiveness, and great personal courage. His ideas were very much those of his own age and modern as well. He offset contemporary Catholicism's negative theological opinion about Judaism with a strong disaffection for any kind of Antisemitism in Hitler's Germany. Brandsma was honoured by the city of Dachau with a street adjoining the former camp, albeit one of the narrowest streets in the town.

In historical records Hao Meng was from Henei Commandery (), which is around present-day Jiaozuo, Henan. One night in July or August 196, he rebelled against Lü Bu in Xiapi (下邳; present- day Pizhou, Jiangsu), the capital of Lü Bu's domain, Xu Province, and led his men to attack Lü Bu's headquarters. He was unable to break into the building. Lü Bu was not aware of the identities of the rebels, but he heard their voices and recognised from their accents that they were from Henei. He was bare- bodied and his hair was dishevelled when the attack occurred. Lü Bu and his wife escaped by climbing over the wall and then they fled to the camp of Gao Shun, one of Lü's subordinates. Lü Bu told Gao Shun about the Henei accents he heard, and Gao Shun deduced that the rebel leader was Hao Meng. Gao Shun then led his troops to Lü Bu's office and drove the rebels away by firing arrows at them. Hao Meng and his men retreated back to their own camp.(建安元年六月夜半時，布將河內郝萌反，將兵入布所治下邳府，詣廳事閤外，同聲大呼攻閤，閤堅不得入。布不知反者為誰，直牽婦，科頭袒衣，相將從溷上排壁出，詣都督高順營，直排順門入。順問：「將軍有所隱不？」布言「河內兒聲」。順言「此郝萌也」。順即嚴兵入府，弓弩並射萌衆；萌衆亂走，天明還故營。) Yingxiong Ji annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7. Hao Meng's subordinate Cao Xing refused to betray Lü Bu, so he turned against his superior and fought with him. During the fight, Hao Meng injured Cao Xing with his spear, but Cao Xing cut off one of his arms with his sword. By then, Gao Shun had shown up to attack Hao Meng's camp and he beheaded the traitor. Lü Bu praised Cao Xing for remaining loyal to him and he put Cao Xing in charge of Hao Meng's men.(萌將曹性反萌，與對戰，萌刺傷性，性斫萌一臂。順斫萌首，牀輿性，送詣布。布問性，言「萌受袁術謀，謀者悉誰？」性言「陳宮同謀。」時宮在坐上，靣赤，傍人悉覺之。布以宮大將，不問也。性言「萌常以此問，性言呂將軍大將有神，不可擊也，不意萌狂惑不止。」布謂性曰：「卿健兒也！」善養視之。創愈，使安撫萌故營，領其衆。) Yingxiong Ji annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 7.

Life Guo Tu was from Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), which is around present-day Xuchang, Henan. He started his career as a subordinate of Han Fu, the Governor of Ji Province. In 191, Guo Tu, along with Xin Ping, Xun Chen and others, managed to convince Han Fu to relinquish his governorship to the warlord Yuan Shao. Guo Tu then became an adviser to Yuan Shao. In 195, the Han Emperor Xian called for help from the lords, pleading them to escort him and the imperial court away from the tyrants Li Jue and Guo Si. Yuan Shao's strategist Ju Shou advised Yuan Shao to take the emperor in and use him as a puppet to control and manipulate the other warlords. Just as Yuan Shao was about to agree and send out an army to rescue the Emperor, Guo Tu objected and said Emperor Xian would control him, not the other way round. Yuan Shao was persuaded by it and did not rescue the Emperor. As a result, the much less powerful warlord Cao Cao took Emperor Xian into his capital of Xuchang and issued many edicts in the Emperor's name, including a harshly worded edict condemning Yuan Shao for conquering Han provinces from other governors. During the Battle of Boma in 200, Yuan Shao ordered Yan Liang, with Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong providing support, to lead troops to attack Boma (白馬; near present-day Hua County, Henan), which was defended by Liu Yan (劉延), a military officer under Yuan Shao's rival Cao Cao. Yan Liang lost the battle and was slain by Guan Yu, who was then a subordinate of Cao Cao. Later that year, during the Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao led a successful raid on Yuan Shao's supply depot at Wuchao (烏巢) and set fire to the supplies. Zhang He and Gao Lan (高覽), two of Yuan Shao's officers, wanted to lead troops to attack Cao Cao at Wuchao and salvage whatever supplies they could. However, Guo Tu strongly objected to this plan and proposed that they attack Cao Cao's main camp instead to divert Cao Cao's attention away from Wuchao. Yuan Shao heeded Guo Tu's advice and ordered Zhang He and Gao Lan to lead troops to attack Cao Cao's main camp. When news reached Yuan Shao that Zhang He and Gao Lan had failed to capture Cao Cao's main camp, Guo Tu became fearful because his idea had gone wrong. He then accused Zhang He and Gao Lan of not doing their best because they were planning to defect. After Zhang He and Gao Lan heard about it, they were so angry that they led their troops and defected to Cao Cao's side. Shen Pei's two sons were captured by Cao Cao's forces during the Battle of Guandu. After the battle, Meng Dai (孟岱), one of Yuan Shao's subordinates, slandered Shen Pei in front of Yuan Shao. Guo Tu and Xin Ping agreed with what Meng Dai said, so Yuan Shao removed Shen Pei from his command in Ye city and replaced him with Meng Dai. In 202, following Yuan Shao's death, his subordinates became polarised into two camps because Yuan Shao did not clearly designate one of his sons as his successor. In one camp, Pang Ji, Shen Pei and others supported Yuan Shang and wanted him to be the new Governor of Ji Province. In the other camp, Xin Ping, Guo Tu and others supported Yuan Tan, Yuan Shao's eldest son. Pang Ji and Shen Pei feared that Yuan Tan would harm them if he came to power so they lied that Yuan Shao had named Yuan Shang as his successor on his deathbed. Yuan Tan retreated to Liyang County (黎陽縣; present-day Xun County, Henan) and appointed himself General of Chariots and Cavalry (車騎將軍) there. Internal conflict soon broke out between Yuan Shang and Yuan Tan, but they cooperated when Cao Cao led his forces to attack them. After Cao Cao retreated, the Yuan brothers started fighting again for control over northern China. In 205, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Tan at the Battle of Nanpi and eliminated him, along with Guo Tu and his other subordinates.

Among his works was The Scots Peerage, a nine- volume series published from 1904 to 1914. He tried two interesting heraldic cases in Court of the Lord Lyon, the first being in 1909, when Sir Colin Macrae claimed the right to use the coat of arms as Chief of the Name of Clan Macrae, which was opposed by Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap. The second was action brought against Mrs. Fraser Mackenzie by Colonel James Stewart- Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth, in connection with the bearing of arms in right of her father. In the second case, the Lyon's ruling was upheld on appeal by the House of Lords. Shortly before his retirement in 1926, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in the 1926 New Year Honours list.

His father Luo Jun (駱俊), who served the Prince of Chen Liu Chong as his chancellor (陳相) in the Eastern Han dynasty, was killed by the warlord Yuan Shu.(駱統字公緒，會稽烏傷人也。父俊，官至陳相，為袁術所害。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Luo Tong's mother remarried after her husband's death, and became a concubine of the official Hua Xin. Luo Tong, who was seven years old then, returned to Kuaiji Commandery with his close friends. Before he left, his mother tearfully saw him off, but Luo Tong did not look back when he boarded the carriage. When the carriage driver told him his mother was behind him, Luo Tong said, \\"I don't want to make my mother miss me even more. That's why I don't look back.\\" Luo Tong was also known for being filial to his stepmother (Hua Xin's official spouse).(統母改適，為華歆小妻，統時八歲，遂與親客歸會稽。其母送之，拜辭上車，面而不顧，其母泣涕於後。御者曰：「夫人猶在也。」統曰：「不欲增母思，故不顧耳。」事適母甚謹。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. At the time, there was a famine, so the residents in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, \\"I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat.\\" His sister replied, \\"You're right. Why do you suffer in silence and not tell me about this?\\" She then took grain from her personal stores and gave it to Luo Tong, and also informed their mother about it. Luo Tong's mother agreed with what they were doing, and she distributed grain to the people. Luo Tong became famous after this incident.(時饑荒，鄉里及遠方客多有困乏，統為之飲食衰少。其姊仁愛有行，寡歸無子，見統甚哀之，數問其故。統曰：「士大夫糟糠不足，我何心獨飽！」姊曰：「誠如是，何不告我，而自苦若此？」乃自以私粟與統，又以告母，母亦賢之，遂使分施，由是顯名。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. When the warlord Sun Quan was nominally serving as the Administrator (太守) of Kuaiji Commandery, Luo Tong, then 19 years old, was appointed as the Chancellor of Wucheng County (烏程縣; south of present-day Huzhou, Zhejiang), which had over 10,000 residents. He performed well in office and received praise from Sun Quan, who promoted him to an Officer of Merit (功曹) and acting Cavalry Commandant (騎都尉).

Luo Tong was known for being very diligent in examining the state of affairs in his jurisdiction. Whenever he encountered important issues that required action, he would attempt to resolve them within the day itself. He also advised Sun Quan to give greater attention to talented and virtuous people, so as to attract them to serve him. He suggested that Sun Quan meet the guests individually (instead of in groups) and hold private conversations with them to understand them better and make them feel appreciated and grateful to him. Sun Quan accepted Luo Tong's advice.(統志在補察，苟所聞見，夕不待旦。常勸權以尊賢接士，勤求損益，饗賜之日，可人人別進，問其燥濕，加以密意，誘諭使言，察其志趣，令皆感恩戴義，懷欲報之心。權納用焉。) Sanguozhi vol. 57.

Some time later, Luo Tong noticed that the people were suffering not only because of heavy taxes and being recruited to perform hard labour, but also because of contagious diseases spreading around. He wrote a long memorial to Sun Quan, explaining the difficult situation the people are in, and pointing out that if the problems could affect the stability of Eastern Wu in the long term if they were not resolved. He urged Sun Quan to implement policies to help the people and relieve their burdens. Sun Quan felt touched after reading Luo Tong's memorial and he paid greater attention to Luo's ideas.(是時徵役繁數，重以疫癘，民戶損耗，統上疏曰：「臣聞君國者，以據疆土為彊富，制威福為尊貴，曜德義為榮顯，永世胤為豐祚。然財須民生，彊賴民力，威恃民勢，福由民殖，德俟民茂，義以民行，六者旣備，然後應天受祚，保族宜邦。書曰：『衆非后無能胥以寧，后非衆無以辟四方。』推是言之，則民以君安，君以民濟，不易之道也。今彊敵未殄，海內未乂，三軍有無已之役，江境有不釋之備，徵賦調數，由來積紀，加以殃疫死喪之災，郡縣荒虛，田疇蕪曠，聽聞屬城，民戶浸寡，又多殘老，少有丁夫，聞此之日，心若焚燎。思尋所由，小民無知，旣有安土重遷之性，且又前後出為兵者，生則困苦無有溫飽，死則委棄骸骨不反，是以尤用戀本畏遠，同之於死。每有徵發，羸謹居家重累者先見輸送。小有財貨，傾居行賂，不顧窮盡。輕剽者則迸入險阻，黨就羣惡。百姓虛竭，嗷然愁擾，愁擾則不營業，不營業則致窮困，致窮困則不樂生，故口腹急，則姧心動而攜叛多也。又聞民間非居處小能自供，生產兒子，多不起養；屯田貧兵，亦多棄子。天則生之，而父母殺之，旣懼干逆和氣，感動陰陽。且惟殿下開基建國，乃無窮之業也，彊鄰大敵非造次所滅，疆埸常守非期月之戍，而兵民減耗，後生不育，非所以歷遠年，致成功也。夫國之有民，猶水之有舟，停則以安，擾則以危，愚而不可欺，弱而不可勝，是以聖王重焉，禍福由之，故與民消息，觀時制政。方今長吏親民之職，惟以辨具為能，取過目前之急，少復以恩惠為治，副稱殿下天覆之仁，勤恤之德者。官民政俗，日以彫弊，漸以陵遲，勢不可乆。夫治疾及其未篤，除患貴其未深，願殿下少以萬機餘閑，留神思省，補復荒虛，深圖遠計，育殘餘之民，阜人財之用，參曜三光，等崇天地。臣統之大願，足以死而不朽矣。」權感統言，深加意焉。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Throughout his career, Luo Tong had written many memorials to Sun Quan, giving appropriate advice on policies. Among all the pieces of advice he gave to Sun Quan, the most notable one is his suggestion to stop increasing conscription, because he felt that forcing the people into conscription would lead to social problems and make them feel resentful. Sun Quan argued with him again and again over this issue, but eventually accepted his ideas.(數陳便宜，前後書數十上，所言皆善，文多故不悉載。尤以占募在民間長惡敗俗，生離叛之心，急宜絕置，權與相反覆，終遂行之。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. In 221–222, Luo Tong participated in the Battle of Xiaoting between Eastern Wu and its former ally state, Shu Han. He was a subordinate of the Wu general Lu Xun, and the Wu forces emerged victorious in the battle. Luo Tong was promoted to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) for his contributions. Later, in 222–223, he participated in the Battle of Ruxu against Wu's rival state Cao Wei. The Wei general Cao Ren had sent his subordinate Chang Diao (常雕) to attack Zhongzhou (中洲). Luo Tong and Yan Gui (嚴圭) led the Wu forces to Zhongzhou to resist the enemy and defeated them. For his success, Luo Tong was promoted to Area Commander of Ruxu (濡須督) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Xinyang Village (新陽亭侯).(以隨陸遜破蜀軍於宜都，遷偏將軍。黃武初，曹仁攻濡須，使別將常雕等襲中洲，統與嚴圭共拒破之，封新陽亭侯，後為濡須督。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. He also spoke up for Zhang Wen when Zhang Wen was implicated in a scandal involving Ji Yan, but Sun Quan did not accept his advice.(將軍駱統表理溫曰：「 ... 」權終不納。) Sanguozhi vol. 57. Luo Tong died in 228 at the age of 36 (by East Asian age reckoning). Luo Jun Luo Tong's father was Luo Jun (駱俊), whose courtesy name was Xiaoyuan (孝遠). Luo Jun was known for being skilful in handling both civil and military affairs. He served as a minor officer in his home commandery when he was young and was nominated as a xiaolian (civil service candidate). He was subsequently promoted to a Gentleman of Writing (尚書郎), and was later appointed as the Chancellor of Chen State. When chaos broke out towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Luo Jun successfully maintained law and order within Chen State and ensured that the people lived well and were safe. Sometime in the 190s, when the warlord Yuan Shu was running short of supplies, he sent a messenger to Chen State to request for grain. Luo Jun saw Yuan Shu as a traitor and despised him, so he refused to send supplies. The angry Yuan Shu then sent assassins to kill Luo Jun.(謝承後漢書曰：俊字孝遠，有文武才幹，少為郡吏，察孝廉，補尚書郎，擢拜陳相。值袁術僭號，兄弟忿爭，天下鼎沸，羣賊並起，陳與比界，姧慝四布，俊厲威武，保疆境，賊不敢犯。養濟百姓，災害不生，歲獲豐稔。後術軍衆饑困，就俊求糧。俊疾惡術，初不應荅。術怒，密使人殺俊。) Annotation from Xie Cheng's Houhanshu in Sanguozhi vol. 57.

Liu Bei sent him and ten other officers to lead their troops to cut off the enemy's route along the gallery roads at Maminge Path (馬鳴閣道; in present-day Guangyuan, Sichuan). However, they were driven back by Xu Huang, a general under Liu Bei's rival Cao Cao, and many of Liu Bei's soldiers fell off the gallery roads into the deep valleys and died during the attack.(備遣陳式等十餘營絕馬鳴閣道，晃別征破之，賊自投山谷，多死者。) Sanguozhi vol. 17.

It was the first capital of the Roman Catholic Bishopric of Livonia, known by the German name of Üxküll. Saint Meinhard, known from the Livonian Chronicle of Henry, was the first bishop of Üxküll. In 1197 Berthold of Hanover, a Cistercian abbot of Loccum, was made the second bishop of Üxküll. Those days the town was the center of the upcoming crusading activities in the Livonian area. Bishop Berthold moved the episcopal see to Riga, but was killed by the Livs in battle. The Livonian word Ikšķile (or the German Uexküll) denotes \\"the ford or islet(s), i.e. a place (on the Daugava River) where it was possible to cross the river, belonging to the son of the nobleman Ike”. The personal name Ike has the honourable meaning ‘age, lifetime’. The Ike family had a great power in Livonia. They controlled the military and trade traffic across the Daugava at Ykescola/Ykescole. Other sources tell that the word Ikšķile (or the German Üxküll, Uexküll) comes from the meaning of (Finno-ugrian) Livonian word ükskül (yksikylä in Finnish). Ükskül (üks = one, kül = village) means simply just village number one, one village or The Village. Latvijas Centrs Ikšķile  History  Ikšķile is one of the oldest inhabited regions of Latvia. This is evidenced by the mound and an ancient burial ground in the present rural area of Ikšķile. By the 9th - 12th centuries there was already a Liv village on the Daugava waterway.  Latvia's First Castle  Building and employment of castles was an important topic in the first accounts available in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry. Henry of Livonia, an eyewitness of the events, started telling about a canon of the Augustinian monastery of Segeburg in Holstein called Meinhard. Meinhard heard stories of travelers about the great Daugava river, an area of commerce for pagan tribes of Livs and Letts. Meinhard venture there to convert people to Christianity. After some conversions, he built a church in the village of Ikšķile and baptized some Livonians. However, the position of the church was vulnerable to attacks, mainly from Lithuanian pagan inhabitants. After a Lithuanian raid attacked in winter, Meinhard and the local people hid in the forests. According to Henry of Livonia's chronicle, Meinhard pointed out that Livonians were foolish for not having fortifications, and promised people to built castles if they convert to Christianism. In 1185 Gotland's stone-mounds built the castle of Ikšķile with a chapel or church. This is the oldest stone castle in Latvia and it is also the oldest stone building in Eastern Baltic. In 1186 the upper bishop of Bremen appointed the monk Meinard, of Segeberga monastery, near Lübeck, as the first bishop of Ikšķile. Under his leadership Ikšķile became the center from which Catholicism would spread in Latvia. Both Meinard and the second bishop, Bertolt, were buried inside Ikšķile Church (Bishop Meinard was later reburied at the Dome Church in Riga). Albert of Buxhovden followed to Berthold as bishop of Uexkull. He arrived at his diocese with a sizeable army of Saxon crusaders and supported by the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope.  Moving of the Livonian Bishopric Center  Albert realized that the diocese of Uexküll, defended by a castle with the same name, was far away from the Daugava river to be effective in the battle. For that reason, he requests another fortification near the sea, that would be the founding of Riga. In 1201, the third Bishop of Ikšķile, Albert, moved the Livonian Bishopric Center to Riga. During the Livonian Crusade Ikšķile Castle was attacked by the Semigallian troops on the left bank of the Daugava several times, and in 1203 and 1206 tried to capture the castle. left In 1638 the municipality of Ikšķile included eight manors, the richest of which being the Ikšķile and Tīnūžu manors. By the 19th century there were two manors left in the Ikšķile municipality, the Ikšķile and Berkava manors. After the formation of Ogre, which originally belonged to the Ikšķile municipality, the area of Ikšķile parish was gradually reduced. The castle of Ikšķile was destroyed in the 17th century, and the church (which was rebuilt many times) was destroyed in 1916 by German artillery. In 1933 a new Lutheran church was erected near Ikšķile, near the station. Due to the construction of the Riga Hydroelectric Power Plant and the reservoir, the ruins of the first stone church were preserved in the 1970s; the island on which they are now located was increased and strengthened. The ruins of Ikšķile manor, as well as a castle, are below the water of the reservoir.  Government  The head of the city government in Ikšķile is the mayor. The incumbent mayor Indulis Trapiņš. Ikšķiles government is located at Ikšķile, Peldu street 22.  School  Ikšķile Secondary School is a Latvian State School, founded in 1966. It is also a Junior Achievement Latvia School. The origins of the Ikšķile School date back to 1864, when the first parish school was established under the leadership of Ikšķile. The school building is named Zemturi. About a hundred years after the development of Ikšķile School it was decided to build a new school. The building of the school took place near the center of Ikšķile, next to the new A6 highway. The Ikšķile School of the Ogre District was opened in 1966. The development and growth continued, therefore additional schools were built, enabling the establishment of a secondary school. From 1989 to 1990, the school was rebuilt, and in 1990 it was named the Ikšķile Secondary School.  Ikšķile library  Ikšķile District Central Library is a library in Ikšķile, located on Peldu street 22. The first library in the vicinity of Ikšķiles was formed and operational by the beginning of the 19th century. The first written information about the library of Ikšķile region can be found at the beginning of V. Villeruš's book \\"Gājums\\", which states that in 1852 a Reading Association with 35 members was established in the Ikšķile municipality. The library was restored in 1946, after the Second World War. There have been changes to the library over the years; in 1974, a separate children's library was created.  Popular places and objects  * Ruins of the Ikšķile Church - the ruins of the oldest stone building in Latvia, located on a small islet, Sv. Meinard Island, artificially created in the Riga hydroelectric power station reservoir. Ikšķile Church was built in 1185 under the direction of Bishop Meinard. Rebuilt in 1879 - 1881, destroyed in 1916. After the flood of the Riga Hydroelectric Power Plant in the 1970s it has been surrounded by the reservoir waters.

Established in 1949, it holds a variety of articles ranging from pre-historic era to modern works of art. It functions under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. The museum is situated on Janpath. The blue–print of the National Museum had been prepared by the Gwyer Committee set up by the Government of India in 1946. The museum has around 200,000 works of art, both of Indian and foreign origin, covering over 5,000 years. It also houses the National Museum Institute of History of Art, Conservation and Museology on the first floor which was established in 1983 and now is a Deemed to be University since 1989, and runs Masters and Doctoral level courses in History of Art, Conservation and Museology.National Museum Institute of History of Art, Conservation and Museology, website History In 1946, the idea of building a National Museum for India was proposed by the Gwyer Committee. Sir Maurice Gwyer, the former Chief Justice of India and Vice Chancellor of Delhi University, headed the Committee. One of the members of the Committee was Sir Mortimer Wheeler who is often cited as chief initiators of the National Museum as he advocated for the museum's development although reports indicate that he was concerned with unifying Archaeological Survey of India site museums under the umbrella of a Museum's branch rather than setting up a new museum. The roots of the National Museum begin with an exhibition of Indian art and artefacts organized by the Royal Academy of Arts, London. The Exhibition went on display in the galleries of Burlington House during the winter months of 1947-48. This Exhibition of The Art of India and Pakistan in London was the first exhibition sponsored by the British government which gave Indian artefacts the status of high art. Before its return to India, with Jawaharlal Nehru's foresight and support, it was decided that these important collections should be showcased here upon their return so that they could be enjoyed and appreciated by the people of India. At the close of the exhibit, requests were released to the loaning museums and collectors, urging them to surrender object ownership to what was to become the National Museum. When the decision was taken to make a permanent National Museum, the exhibits were first displayed in the State Rooms of the Rashtrapati Bhavan (then called the Government House) on August 15, 1949 and the rooms were formally inaugurated by C. Rajgopalachari, Governor General of India.National Museum- Bulletin No. 12 Until the mid-1950s, it essentially remained a permanent version of the temporary exhibit – consisting of the same pieces, and remaining in the state rooms. In 1955 building began on the new current location of the National Museum at Janpath. However, when the National Museum was ready in 1960, the statue of Lord Buddha and the Rampurva Bull were retained at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on the request of Jawaharlal Nehru. Since its inception, the National Museum owed much of its original structure and organization to the Indian Museum, Kolkata as some of its first curators were former employees of the Indian Museum, such as C. Sivaramamurti even though the National museum aspired to displace the historic position the Indian Museum had come to acquire as the largest and grandest museum in India. Despite of some semblance, the National Museum encouraged the scholars and the public to think differently about the objects on display by placing the objects within a broad historical context and allowing the objects to speak for a larger representation outside of itself. Grace Morley was the first Director of the National Museum, New Delhi who earlier played instrumental role of the founding director (1935–58) of the San Francisco Museum of Art (now San Francisco Museum of Modern Art). She joined the National Museum on the 8th of August, 1960 and continued to hold its charge for six more years. She was one of the advocates of cultural democracy who believed that art should be available to everyone—and held firm convictions about the crucial role that museums could play in this endeavour. In her installations for the National Museum, this desire for secularisation and democratisation was effected through the presentation of sculptures in classic white-cube spaces with minimal contextual information. It was her ‘visual storage’ display system, minimalist teak pedestals, air-conditioning vents, track-lighting, and large glass cases with staggered risers for visual variety which led to the museum acquiring international recognition and the museum in its working still reflects her image. She instructed carpenters to build display cases and Eamesian-type couches, cabinets and cases that reflected modernist, uncluttered lines. Such elements produced the perfect streamlined stage for a performance of the modern by viewing audiences. Harmonious colour schemes, dramatic, dim lighting, cushions of space around eye-level objects, and the occasional leafy plant for a visual pause, all contributed to the creation of a modern museum. Departments and collections Reception of Museum The Entrance Corridor of the National Museum housing artefacts on both the sides Presently, there are several departments in the National Museum. * Pre-History Archaeology * Archaeology * Manuscripts * Numismatics & Epigraphy * Paintings * Arms & Armour * Decorative Arts * Central Asian Antiquities * Pre-Columbian Art * Jewellery * Anthropology *Anubhav * Education * Public Relations * Publication * Conservation * Display The collections of the National Museum represents almost all disciplines of art: Archaeology (Sculptures in Stone, Bronze & Terracota), Arms, Armour, Decorative Arts, Jewellery, Manuscripts, Miniatures and Tanjore Paintings, Textiles, Numismatics, Epigraphy, Central Asian Antiquities, Anthropology, Pre-Columbian American and Western Art Collections.

The national museum of India is beautiful, and is worth a visit Building right Inside view of the Museum BuildingThe current building of the National Museum was designed by the architect Ganesh Bikaji Deolalikar and the foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on May 12, 1955. Once the building was ready, the new museum was inaugurated by Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Vice-President of India on December 18, 1960. It stands today on the plot of land earmarked in Edwin L. Lutyens' plan for the Imperial Museum and was occupied by a small Museum of Central Asian Antiquities that housed the important collection of the explorer Sir Aurel Stein. The National Museum building was planned to be built in phases to finally give it an octagonal shape. Its first phase was inaugurated in 1960 and the second was completed in 1989. For the third and final phase, a foundation stone was laid in December 18, 2017 and involves razing down of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) building which has been moved to Dharohar Bhawan. As maps of the original plan suggest, roughly a quarter portion remains to be added for the completion of the building. The National Museum building has three floors with galleries radiating from a central garden court. The National Museum Institute, which is on the first floor of the museum and has a “deemed to be university” status, will be shifting to a new campus in Noida.  Collections =Harappan Gallery A view of the Harappan Gallery A view of the pottery from the Harappan gallery The museum has various artefacts from the Harappan Civilization also known as Indus Valley Civilization. It has the world's most representative collection of antiquities of the Harappan Civilization - over 3500 objects that are on permanent loan from the Archaeological Survey of India to the Museum. Most famous among the objects is the Dancing Girl made in Bronze which belongs to the early Harappan period, Skeleton excavated from Rakhigarhi in Haryana, Terracotta images of Mother Goddess and Clay Pottery. Apart from these the gallery has Sculptures in Bronzes & Terracotta, Bone Objects, Ivory, Steatite, Semi-Precious Stones, Painted Pottery and Jewellery items. Many seals are also on display which has been discovered during numerous excavations and were probably used for trading purposes. These seals depict bulls, elephants, unicorns, tigers, crocodiles, unknown symbols. On one of the seal, there is the depiction of Pasupati that has been interpreted as proto-Shiva. The gallery attempts to present the vibrancy of human civilization in India at par with the contemporary civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt and China. When one of the major sites of the Harappan civilization, Mohenjo Daro was excavated in the 1920s, archaeologists deposited its important finds first in the Lahore Museum, and then these were moved to Delhi by Mortimer Wheeler in anticipation of the construction of a Central Imperial Museum there. At the time of Partition, the issue of ownership of these objects arose and eventually the two countries agreed to share all the collections equally, although this was sometimes interpreted in literal sense, with several necklaces and girdles taken apart with half the beads sent to Pakistan and half retained in India. In the words of Nayanjot Lahiri, ‘the integrity of these objects were compromised in the name of equitable division’. Of the two most celebrated sculpted figures found in Mohenjo Daro, Pakistan asked for and received the steatite figure of a bearded male, dubbed the 'Priest King', while the National Museum of India retained the bronze statuette of the 'Dancing Girl', a nude bejeweled female. Considering that the major sites like Mohenjo Daro and Harappa belonged to Pakistan post- Partition, the collections in this gallery also grew out of the discoveries of the excavations made after the Indian independence in 1947 such as Daimabad, Rakhigarhi, Dholavira etc. Key highlights of the collection include: * Mother Goddess (2700–2100 BC) * Toy Cart (2700–2100 BC) * Bull (2700–2100 BC) * Pasupati Seal (2700–2100 BC) * Climbing Monkey (2700–2100 BC) * Dancing Girl (2700–2100 BC) File:Dancing girl.jpgDancing Girl Image:Mohenjodaro toy 001.jpgToy cart from Mohenjo-daro File:Harrappan artefacts 01.JPGPerforated Jar File:Harrappan artefacts 02.JPGMother Goddess File:Harappa seals nm india 02.JPGSeals File:Harappa arms.JPGArms from Harappan Civilization File:Harrappan artefacts 10.JPGBowl File:Skeleton harappa.JPGOne of 11 skeletons found from Rakhigarhi Maurya, Shunga and Satvahana Arts Gallery Maurya, Shunga and Satvahana Arts Gallery Artefacts The gallery has objects from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE.

For instance, one can have a sensory experience of a mid-19th century coin from the Awadh region which has been recreated in 23-inch diameter and 2-inch thickness.  Governance  On the basis of nature of grants and exercise of control, the National Museum comes within the purview of Central Government of India. It was initially looked after by the Director General of Archaeology until 1957, when the Ministry of Education, Government of India, declared it a separate institution and placed it under its own direct control, following this shift the museum began to significantly increase both its staff and its collections using funds from the Art Purchase Committee. At present, the National Museum is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.  Donors  The first wave of collecting for the National Museum started in 1948 and which lasted around 1952, drawing heavily on scholars like V. S. Agarwala, Moti Chandra, Rai Krishnadas, Karl Khandalavala and their personal relationships with private collectors. Funding for mass collecting was granted by Parliament from 1947 but this first acquisition period is marked by lack of descriptive detail, quantifiable data, parameters surrounding the criteria of selection. O. C. Gangoly (1881-1974) sold a group from his collection of paintings to the National Museum in whose foundation he states he played a role. He further avers that he encouraged other fellow collectors to bequeath their collections to the National Museum but was not always successful. Collections of Burjor N. Treasurywalla (d. 1947) also resides in the National Museum, about which Gangoly says almost nothing except that it was large and important. He does emphasize how he was involved in the purchasing of the collection itself except that it was likely that Khandalavala, a relative of Treasurywallla, played a greater role. V. S. Agarwala was instrumental in securing extensive private collection of Ajit Ghose of Calcutta, Dickinson collection, Gulab Chand collection, Modi's collection and Medd's collection. In recent years, according to a Standing Committee on Transport, Culture and Tourism query, the number of collections added to the National Museum was a total of 2269 objects during the period of 1994-2010. Out of this 1360 objects were purchased and remaining 906 objects were acquired through gifts etc. This small number was attributed to the Art Acquisition Committee of the National Museum being defunct since 1997. Auditorium Beside the galleries, the museum also has an auditorium with a seating capacity of 250 people. A brief film introducing the museum and its collections is screened in the auditorium regularly. Film shows on art, history and heritage are also screened.  Digitization of Museum Collections  The National Museum has started a special project to digitize its collection of objects in order to make it available for visitors to see online. This process involves digitization and storage of museum collections in a collection management system named ‘JATAN’. JATAN is a virtual museum builder software, that enables creation of digital collection management system for Indian museums and is deployed in several national museums across India. Its objective is to make a digital imprint of all the objects preserved in museums and help researchers, curators and other people interested in the field which has been designed and developed by Centre for Development of Smart Computing (C-DAC) Pune. The digital imprints (of preserved objects and monuments) created using the JATAN software are integrated in the national digital repository and portal for making them accessible to the public. The National portal and digital repository for museums of India provides an integrated access to theme based collections and artefacts (in terms of sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, weapons, coins and numerous other categories of artefacts) irrespective of the physical and geographical locations of museums. Centre for Development of Smart Computing has also developed “Darshak”, a mobile-based application aimed at improving the museum visit experience among the differently-abled. It allows real-time museum visitors gather all details about objects or artefacts simply by scanning a QR code placed near the object.  National Museum Collections on the Google Art Project  National Museum has volunteered objects from its collection on the Google Art Project which is a non- commercial initiative of Google through the Google Cultural Institute. More than hundred objects have been photographed and their descriptions are available on the Google Art Project website under the name of National Museum, New Delhi which has given a high reach to online visitors for the collection. The Google page of National Museum will be populated further by adding other pertinent collections from National Museum on it.National Museum- Bulletin No.11  Controversy  In 2010, in the first study of its kind, UNESCO presented a report which rated the National Museum along with other seven museums, as badly maintained, poorly lit and having incorrect signs. In a response by the then Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment and Tourism, Selja Kumari in a written reply to Parliament said that the ratings and findings of the report were invalid since the no. of surveyors was inadequate.  Future  Although in its early stages, another project for which the site proposed for redevelopment constitutes the most iconic part of India’s capital city, Central Vista, the National Museum is one of the buildings listed in the tender as some of these buildings approaching the end of their “structural lives” while those that are around a 100 years old, like North and South Blocks, are not “earthquake safe”.

He rose from a common criminal to a powerful warlord who was eventually acknowledged as a high-ranking official and granted a marquisate which his family maintained after his death. Life Chu Yan was from Zhending County, Changshan Commandery, which is around present-day Zhengding County, Hebei. Because he was fast, agile, and brave, his men called him \\"Feiyan\\", meaning \\"Flying Swallow\\". He joined the bandit group of Zhang Niujue () around 184. When the group raided Julu Commandery in 185, however, Zhang Niujue was mortally wounded. Before he died, Zhang ordered his men to obey Chu Yan as their new leader. Chu Yan thus changed his family name from \\"Chu\\" to \\"Zhang\\" to honour Zhang Niujue. Zhang Yan's force steadily grew in strength, until they were said to be one million strong. They became known as the Heishan bandits, and operated as bandit confederacy in the Taihang Mountains. All the commanderies north of the Yellow River were exposed to their attacks and the Han imperial court could do nothing to stop them. In order to pacify him, the government eventually appointed Zhang Yan \\"General of the Household Who Pacifies Disorder\\" and granted him the right to appoint officials in his territories. By the early 190s, Zhang Yan had formed an alliance with the warlord Gongsun Zan against their common opponent, Yuan Shao. Around this time, Zhang Yan gave shelter to the military official Lü Bu who had previously fled from the capital Chang'an; when the de facto regent of the imperial court, Li Jue, offered a reward for Lü's capture, the latter defected to Yuan Shao. In 193, Yuan Shao sent his armies (including Lü Bu and his followers) into the Taihang Mountains to destroy the Heishan bandits under Zhang Yan. The southern hills were overrun, but Zhang Yan managed to fight Yuan's forces to a stalemate and maintained his fief in Changshan. When Yuan Shao grew dissatisfied with Lü Bu and tried to kill him, the officer promptly defected back to Zhang Yan before leaving for the south. In 199, Zhang Yan responded to Gongsun Zan's request for help in the Battle of Yijing against Yuan Shao, but Gongsun Zan was defeated before Zhang Yan arrived. In 204, Zhang Yan made contact with the warlord Cao Cao, who at the time was warring against Yuan Shao's sons, Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang. Cao Cao appointed him General Who Pacifies the North (). In the summer of 205, after Cao Cao defeated the Yuans, Zhang Yan officially surrendered to the Han imperial court and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Anguo Village (). He thereafter ruled his territories as vassal to Cao Cao. After his death, his son Zhang Fang succeeded him as marquis; his family maintained their fief during the following decades.

The word changlun originates from Thai, Changlon (), which means \\"fallen elephant\\". The construction of the North–South Expressway passing through Changlun has enabled the town to enjoy smooth development. The completed Changlun–Kuala Perlis Highway helps to speed up development in the town as well. With the new federal highway, motorists are able to travel to important higher education institutions, such as Universiti Utara Malaysia http://www.uum.edu.my/ in Sintok, Kolej Pertanian Malaysia, Kolej Matrikulasi Kedah, Kolej Matrikulasi Perlis, UiTM, Perlis Branch Campus in Arau, UniMAP and the Perlis State Polytechnic. Motorists are also advised to use the toll- free federal highway for reach Langkawi via Kuala Perlis faster. History Sultanate of Kedah Kedah is one of the oldest surviving sultanates in the world founded in 1136. Prior to becoming part of Malaysia, it had a well- defined territory and population supported by a working government and had previously entered into various legal relations with other nations like Siam and the British. Siam has been claiming that Kedah was part of their kingdom. Anglo–Siamese Treaty of 1909 When the British and Siam signed the Anglo- Siamese Treaty of 1909 without taking into consideration the interests of the Kedah Sultanate, deciding what belonged to whom, Changlun was divided into two parts. The main border town of Changlun became the district of Kubang Pasu, now in Kedah of Malaysia. The rest remained as Thailand. Tambon Sadao, together with the former minor district (King Amphoe) Prik, forms modern Sadao.Great Britain, Treaty Series, No. 19 (1909) This resulting in adverse socio-demographic impacts that affected majority Malay population particularly in the Thai provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat.

It is part of the West Kirby and Thurstaston Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The village lies on the A540 road between Heswall and Caldy, although it extends some distance down Station Road to the Wirral Way and the River Dee estuary. At the time of the 2001 census, the village itself had only 160 inhabitants, although the national census included Caldy and parts of Irby, bringing the total population to 15,548. History Thurstaston means \\"village of a man called Thorsteinn/Þorsteinn\\", from the Old Norse personal name Thorsteinn/Þorsteinn and Old English tún \\"farm, village\\". A record of the name as Torstestiune in 1048 proves this origin. The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Turstanetone. Historically and popularly, the name was wrongly thought to refer to \\"Thor's Stone\\", a sandstone outcrop on Thurstaston Common. A Viking settlement called Straumby once existed in Tinker's Dale, near the modern-day Thurstaston Visitor Centre. The village is centred on the church of St Bartholomew, and Thurstaston Hall, of which parts date from 1350, although most of the current building dates from between 1680 and 1835. A ghostly \\"white lady\\" is said to haunt the Hall. The earliest mention of a Church occurs around 1125 but other evidence suggests that one may have existed in Saxon times. The Norman church endured for many hundreds of years but was eventually taken down in 1820 and a second edifice, a plain stone building, was completed in 1824. In 1871, the executors of Joseph Hegan of Dawpool set apart £4,500 for a new church to be erected in his memory. This was designed in late-13th-century mid-gothic style by John Loughborough Pearson, also the architect of Truro Cathedral, and was built entirely of local sandstone. It was consecrated in 1886. Although nothing remains of the earlier Norman church, the tower of the second one still stands in the churchyard and the sandstone of the building was used to construct a wall enclosing the new churchyard. In 1882 the Liverpool shipowner Thomas Ismay, founder of White Star Line, built his mansion 'Dawpool' at Thurstaston; Ismay is said to have used his influence to ensure that the West Kirby–Hooton railway be routed a mile away along the Dee Estuary, rather than closer to the village. He was also successful in moving the main Heswall to West Kirby road, which came too close to the doorstep of his mansion, via a cutting through Thurstaston Hill. Ismay is buried in the nearby St Bartholomew's churchyard. The solidly built 'Dawpool', designed by Richard Norman Shaw, was demolished by explosives in 1927. Still standing in the village is the original building of Dawpool Primary School, now a private house. Thurstaston railway station, on the Chester and Birkenhead Railway branch line from to opened in 1886. During World War II the station was used to unload munitions to service the anti- aircraft guns that had been installed nearby on Lever Brothers camp site. Passenger services had ended in 1954, although freight transportation on the line continued until complete closure in 1962. The route is now a public footpath known as the Wirral Way, officially opening in 1973. Civic history Thurstaston, including the hamlet of Dawpool, was a parish within the Wirral Hundred, in the county of Cheshire. It became a civil parish in 1866. The population was 112 in 1801, 98 in 1851, 141 in 1901 and 151 in 1951. From 1894 Thurstaston was part of Wirral Rural District, then Wirral Urban District from 1933. On 1 April 1974, local government reorganisation in England and Wales resulted in most of Wirral, including Thurstaston, transfer from the county of Cheshire to Merseyside. Geography Thurstaston beach Thurstaston is notable for the large areas of parkland and heathland. Thurstaston Common is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a local nature reserve. Nearby is Thurstaston Hill, a Triassic sandstone ridge and one of the highest points on the Wirral. On the eastern side of the hill is Thorstone Rock, a large sandstone mound which was reputed, in early times, to have been thrown by the Norse god Thor. The offices and a visitor centre of Wirral Country Park are near the site of Thurstaston railway station. The former trackbed of part of the Birkenhead Railway has been converted into a public footpath – the 'Wirral Way'. The visitor centre contains displays relevant to the local ecology. Governance Thustaston is part of the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. The current Member of Parliament is Margaret Greenwood, a Labour representative, who has been the MP since 2015. At local government level the village is within the West Kirby and Thurstaston Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. Thurstaston is represented on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council by three councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 2 May 2019. Transport=Road To the east of the village is the A540 road, which runs from Hoylake to Chester. The section between Caldy and Heswall is named Telegraph Road. It intersects at a roundabout with Thurstaston Road, which heads north-easterly towards Irby. Rail Since the closure of the Chester and Birkenhead Railway branch line in 1962, West Kirby railway station on the Wirral line of the Merseyrail network and Heswall railway station on the Borderlands line are the nearest stations to the village.

It is situated on the Warta River. Before World War II about 50 percent of the town's population was Jewish. When the Germans invaded, they immediately brutalized this population, kidnapping them for forced labor, robbing them of their possessions, and in early 1940, forcing them into a ghetto, leaving behind their furniture and other possessions for locals and Germans to take. In spring 1942, several Jews, including the rabbi, were hung, allegedly for sending bread to Jews who had been sent to forced labor camps. In August 1942, all Jews were rounded up and held in a church for three days with nothing to eat. Some died from hunger and thirst, others were shot there. Afterwards, around 1000 were sent to the Chelmno killing camp where they were immediately gassed. Another few hundred were sent to the Lodz ghetto. The number of pre-war Warta Jewish survivors is unclear; at least 50 and perhaps close to 200. More than 40 registered there after the war, but two were killed by Polish nationalists after the war ended, and the others left the town.

Museum history The museum was created as a Works Progress Administration project. It was established in 1941 and opened on May 24, 1942. The complex is made up of four buildings — the Manny Mansion, the Barnes Mansion, the Solem Wing, and the Water Lab. The Solem Wing is the public portion of Burpee Museum. Built in the winter of 1998, the Solem Wing houses the museum's exhibits, meeting rooms, laboratories, gift shop, and the Mahlburg Auditorium. It is named after Robert H. Solem who was a major benefactor, patron, and friend of the museum. The Manny Mansion was owned by John P. Manny and was built in 1852. Formerly the Burpee Art Museum, it is now attached to the south side of the Solem Wing and houses museum classrooms and offices. Prior to the expansion, the museum was housed entirely in the Barnes Mansion. Built in 1893, the mansion was owned by industrialist William Fletcher Barnes. Today, the Barnes Mansion houses meeting rooms and the administrative offices. The Water Lab (funded by Aqua Aerobic) is a lab facility along the Rock River in which students in grades 6 through high school collect water samples from the river and analyze them for physical, chemical and biological parameters.

She was 11 years old at death, and is half as big as her adult counterpart \\"Sue,\\" who is 43 feet long and resides at Chicago's Field Museum. Jane's weight was probably nearly 1,500 lbs. Her big feet and long powerful legs indicate she was built for speed. Her lower jaw has 17 finely curved, serrated, razor-sharp teeth designed to tear into flesh.Farlow, JO; Smith MB, Robinson JM (1995). \\"Body mass, bone \\"strength indicator\\", and cursorial potential of Tyrannosaurus rex\\".

Another exhibit is Homer, the most complete subadult Triceratops fossil yet discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of southeastern Montana, found by Helmuth Redschlag in July 2005. Homer is the primary constituent of the first Triceratops bone bed,Mathews, Joshua C.; Brusatte, Stephen L.; Williams, Scott A.; and Henderson, Michael D.

Homer's postcrania after preparation, August 2012. The bones are preparing to be mounted for display as part of a new exhibit opening May 2013 Jane the dinosaur's skull replica In July 2006 The Science Channel aired The Mystery Dinosaur, a one-hour documentary on the discovery and continuing scientific argument over whether Jane is a juvenile T. rex or an adult Nanotyrannus lancensis. The Mystery Dinosaur aired on the Discovery Channel in the fall of 2006. In March 2007, Jane was nominated as one of Illinois' Seven Wonders. The Carboniferous Coal Forest A two-story tall prehistoric coal forest is created, which displays local landscape, insects and amphibians as they existed 300 million years ago. Featuring life-size replicas of giant insects and tetrapods, the diorama acts as an analogue to the Mazon Creek fossil beds, a Carboniferous-age geological Lagerstätten in central Illinois, responsible for the preservation of most of the area's coal. Chief among the exhibit's specimens is Tullimonstrum gregarium, the Tully Monster, which is the enigmatic state fossil of Illinois. The Ordovician Sea An exhibit located adjacent to the front desk featuring local fossils from the Ordovician Platteville, Mifflin, and Grand Detour Formations, as well as a diorama of life in the prehistoric Rockford; an expansive sea and coral margin 455 million years in the making. Geoscience Displays focus on how the earth was formed and the forces at work shaping our planet. Included are exhibits on economic, world and regional geology; a 10-foot glacier model; displays of unusual rocks, gems, and minerals; and information on plate tectonics and land formations. The First People Displays and exhibits give the history of humankind in North America. The First People features a full-size wigwam and tipi, an American Bison, and a dugout canoe that can be climbed into. The display includes video presentations focused on Native American lifestyles and archeology. Windows to Wilderness-Exploring nature in the Rock River Valley Focusing on the wildlife of the Rock River Valley, the Windows to Wilderness exhibit includes live and mounted wildlife; scale recreations of common landscapes and environments of the Rock River Valley. This exhibit includes hands-on activities designed to entertain children. The Fossil Preparation Viewing Lab The Fossil Preparation Lab is a window into how the museum works. The Burpee Museum is home to a talented staff of vertebrate fossil preparators and scientists who restore and curate specimens collected at the museum's dig sites abroad, including Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. Located on the lower level, the viewing area's large glass windows reveal the biology and paleontology laboratories where specimens are prepared for the museum's collections and exhibits. Visitors are able to view exhibits and collections pieces as they are prepared and researched before going on exhibit or into the permanent collection. The Burpee Museum of Natural History maintains more than 100 thousand items in its permanent collection.

The doctrine arises not only in criminal law but also in civil law, where it is relevant to contract law and trusts law. Contract law Duress involves illegitimate threats. The common law long allowed a claim if duress was of a physical nature. So long as a threat is just one of the reasons a person enters an agreement, even if not the main reason, the agreement may be avoided. In Barton v Armstrong[1973] UKPC 2, [1976] AC 104 Mr Armstrong tried to \\"strong-arm\\" Mr Barton into paying him a large golden parachute to exit a business by getting his goons to make death threats to Barton's family. Even though Barton was tough, and would have probably done the payout regardless, he could avoid the agreement. Only late in the 20th century was escape allowed if the threat involved illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always \\"illegitimate\\" if it is to do an unlawful act, such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push someone out of business.See D & C Builders Ltd v Rees [1965] EWCA Civ 3, [1965] 2 QB 617. Note that in UK labour law, concerning strikes, the threat to break a contract while in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute is a protected act under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, s 219. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao On v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal aimed at purchasing their company's building unless the Lau family agreed to change a guarantee agreement assuring the Paos would receive the rise in the swapped shares' prices when repurchased.[1979] UKPC 2, [1980] AC 614 The Privy Council advised that the Laus signing the guarantee agreement after the threat of non-completion of the main agreement was only a result of \\"commercial pressure\\", not economic duress. Just by observing the Laus' behaviour, and consideration of the situation before signing, there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a vulnerable person.See Daniel v Drew [2005] EWCA Civ 507, [2005] WTLR 807, where the Court of Appeal held that a nephew who threatened his old Auntie Muriel with court proceedings if she did not reduce his rent as a beneficiary allowed was actual undue influence. This is the same as duress. Cf US Restatement (Second) of Contracts 1979 §176 An obvious case involving \\"lawful act duress\\" is blackmail. The blackmailer has to justify, not doing the lawful act they threaten, but against a person highly vulnerable to them, the demand of money.See R v Attorney General for England and Wales [2003] UKPC 22, [2003] EMLR 499 Criminal law This is an exception to the general principle of criminal law that those who choose to break the law are held responsible for the crimes that they commit. The rationale of the exception is that the choice is not wholly voluntary. The Law Commission (1977 at paras 2.44–2.46) recognised the logic that, if the defence was going to be allowed at all, it should be applied to all offences. But this recommendation has not been adopted because it is felt that, in the case of the most serious crimes such as murder, no threat to the defendant, however extreme, should excuse commission of the crime (Elliott; 1989). The defence is also open to abuse. Smith (1994 at p584) commented: > ... duress is a unique defence in that it is so much more likely than any > other to depend on assertions which are peculiarly difficult for the > prosecution to investigate or subsequently to disprove. This approach has been adopted by the judiciary, most notably by the House of Lords in R v H [2004] 2 WLR 335:approving a comment in Turner [1995] 2 Cr App R > Defences that the accused has been set up and allegations of duress, which > used to at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to > the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about > informants with very great care. The prosecution's difficulty was at one time the greater when the issue of duress had not been raised by the defence until the trial was under way. To counter these problems, the Law Commission (1993 at paras 33–34) recommended that the burden of proof be shifted to the defendant to establish duress on the balance of probabilities. Since then there has been no specific enactment relating to duress but Section 5 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, c.25, provides that the defence must serve on the Court and the prosecution the nature of the accused's defence in general terms, and the matters in issue.Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 This would seem to apply to the defence of duress, and in R v Tyrell and others 2004 EWCA Crim 3279, there had been a specific, although late, reliance upon the defence. A rigorous analysis of the doctrine of duress is difficult because it is invariably reliant upon the particular facts in a given case, and there is usually an overlap between duress and the defence of necessity. See, for example, comments by Lord Woolf CJ in R v ShaylerR v Shayler [2001] EWCA Crim 1977 at Para. 42. History and reasoning Duress as a defence has existed for many centuries and originates in common law—its extension to cover duress by circumstances did not occur until the 1990s, specifically the case of R v Pommell.[1995] 2 Cr App R 607 The defence of duress (by threat), according to Lord Bingham in R v Hasan, \\"excuses what would otherwise be criminal conduct\\" rather than justifies it. Bingham draws a distinction here with self-defence regarding between the moral status of the victim: in a case of self-defence, the victim has themselves made an aggressive or criminal act towards the defendant. In a duress case, there is no such relationship of prior aggression. Bingham notes at paragraph 19: The threat The law limits the nature of the threat that has to be placed on a person for them to qualify as being under duress. The threat must be one of death or serious personal injury, either to the defendant or to his immediate family or someone close to him. In R v Singh,[1973] 1 AER 122 the Court of Appeal held that a threat to expose the defendant's adultery would not be sufficient threat to overbear the will of an ordinary person. The defendant must have a reasonable and genuinely held fear of death or serious harm, usually in the form of specific threats directed at the defendant, his immediate family or someone for whom he feels responsible. In R v Graham,[1982] 1 AER 801 the threat was immediately and directly made to the defendant. In the Australian case of R v Hurley & Murray(1967) VR 526 escaped criminals compelled H to dispose of two corpses by holding his wife hostage, such that the threats to her \\"would have been operative during the entire period of his absence\\" and \\"his only concern must have been for the safety of the woman\\". Following R v Conway[1989] QB 290 and R v Wright,[2000] Crim. LR 510 (where the threat related in part to the defendant's boyfriend) the specimen direction of the Judicial Studies Board suggests that the threat must be directed, if not to the defendant or a member of his immediate family, to a person for whose safety the defendant would reasonably regard himself as responsible which, if strictly applied, would be consistent with the rationale of the duress exception. Causal link As seen in R v Cole 1994 Crim. LR 582, there must be a direct causal link between these threats and the defendant's decision to break the law. Thus, the defendant's normal inhibitions must be overwhelmed by his or her belief in the efficacy of the threat. Following R v Safi (2003) it is held that the defendant need only prove he reasonably and genuinely believed there was a threat, i.e. the test is both subjective and objective in that the defendant's will must actually have been overwhelmed by the threat, and a reasonable person of average courage may also have felt compelled to act the same way under direction. Immediacy The circumstances in which the threats were made must also have offered no reasonable opportunity for evasive action. But, taken together, the questions of causation and immediacy have created a weakness in the limitations placed on the defence. In R v Hudson and Taylor 1971 2 QB 202, two young women who had witnessed a serious assault were intimidated and refused to identify the attacker in court. They were charged with perjury but allowed a conditional discharge. The court was prepared to allow leniency because these women lived in a community where physical retaliation for co-operating with the police was routine, and they had no reasonable means, given their age, experience, and lack of physical strength, of avoiding the implementation of the threat. This weakened the requirement that the threat's implementation must be so imminent that the defendant had to decide in that moment whether to break the law, and it has given rise to cases such as R v Cole 1994 Crim. LR 582 in which a man robbed several building societies to avoid the threats of a debt collector. Simon Brown LJ. at p583 held that the peril relied on to support the plea of necessity lacked imminence, and the degree of directness and immediacy required of a sufficient nexus between the suggested peril and the offence charged. The one making the threats had not nominated the crimes to be committed by the defendant. He had simply indicated that he wanted the defendant to repay the debt which would not necessarily involve the commission of an offence. The characteristics of the reasonable person In R v Bowen [1996] 2 Cr. App. R. 157, the Court of Appeal held person with a low IQ, short of mental impairment or mental defectiveness, was not necessarily less courageous or less able to withstand threats and pressure than an ordinary person. The relevant test (laid down in R v Graham 1982 1 AER 801) had two elements: > Stuart-Smith LJ gave comprehensive guidance as to which characteristics > might be relevant in the jury's consideration: age, sex, physical disability > or recognised mental illness might limit a person's ability to act in self- > defence, but the fact that the defendant was more vulnerable, timid or > susceptible to threats than a normal person were not characteristics of the > reasonable person. Also excluded would be self-induced incapacity due to > drunkenness or drug-taking (R v Flatt 1996 Crim LR 576). Duress by > circumstances There have been an increasing number of cases pleading > duress arising from the general pressure of circumstances, whether arising > directly from human action or not. To that extent, this subset of duress > seeks to borrow some of the language of necessity. In R v Conway (1988) 3 > AER 1025, the Court of Appeal dealt with a charge of reckless driving where > the defendant had fled from police officers. His passenger had recently been > attacked by a man with a shotgun, and screamed at the defendant to \\"drive > off\\" when he saw the plain-clothed officers running toward the car. The > court held that to establish \\"duress of circumstances\\", it was necessary for > him to drive as he did believing it necessary to avoid death or serious > bodily injury to himself or another person. As evidence, the accused must be > able to point to an \\"objective danger\\" or at least satisfy the requirement > of reasonable belief.

It is situated at the western end of Loch Earn where the A85 road from Crieff meets the A84. Loch Earn is above sea level, with the settlement running from its shores up to higher ground on the hills at the mouth of Glen Ogle.OS Landranger 51 Lochearnhead lies within the Breadalbane area of the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. Early history The first evidence of people in Lochearnhead comes from Mesolithic arrowheads found in Glen Ogle by former local policeman Tom Gibbon, and his son Donald.Mesolithic A settled population is in evidence in the Neolithic period, from a burial chamber at Edinchip,OS Pathfinder 347, grid ref 575 218 and from the cup-marked stones which lie between the Kendrum Burn and the Craggan Road,OS Pathfinder 347, grid ref 589 231 in what is known locally as the Druid Field. There is another site with cup and ring marks at the head of Glen Ogle. There are two crannogs still visible on Loch Earn, one at the west end of the loch in Carstran Bay, below Edinample Castle, the other at the east end of the loch, at St Fillans, known as Neish Island. (Other submerged possible crannog sites also exist, and recent surveys by the Scottish Crannog CentreThe Scottish Crannog Centre and othersSNH Commissioned Report 093, Loch Lomond and the Trossachs landscape character assessment suggest the known number may increase if the archaeology is enabled to go ahead). These man-made islands probably date from the Bronze Age, although Neish Island was inhabited (latterly by the Clan Neish, for whom it is now named) until 1612.Septs The Pictish frontier Loch Earn was on the frontier between Pictland and Dalriada, or Dál Riata. Dundurn at the east end of the loch being a Pictish frontier fort.Ritchie, R, (1989), Picts, HMSO. This lends weight to the argument that the name Earn therefore comes from Eireann, in other words \\"the loch of the Irish\\". The siege, by the Scots, of the Pictish Fort of Dundurn in 683 ADAnnals of Ulster, CELT, the Corpus of Electronic Texts: University College Cork is mentioned in the Annals of Ulster. Giric, (sometimes called Grig), King of Picts and Scots, is said to have been killed at Dundurn in 889, and is buried in Iona.A. A. M. Duncan, The Kingship of the Scots 842–1292: Succession and Independence. Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 2002., Feudal estates Although Norman nobles had been obtaining land in Scotland for a century beforehand, the coming of the feudal era is attributed to David I of Scotland in the first half of the 12th century. Feudalism proved the backdrop for local history for several centuries, not least in land ownership patterns. The ownership map of the land around Loch Earn changed as land owning families came and went, and the shape of estates fluctuated, partly through the politics of inheritance. Three family names associated with Lochearnhead are MacLaren, Stewart and MacGregor. The first of these is recorded in 1296, when Lauren of Ardveich had his name entered into the Ragman Roll.Ragman Roll, 1296: Names, A The MacLaren burial ground at Leckine was last used in 1993.Clan McLaren of Ardveich burial ground at Leckine By the time the Stewarts came to Ardvorlich in 1582,McNaughton, D,(1988) The History of Upper Strathearn, Jamieson & Munro. the Reformed church, under the guidance of John Knox, had been adopted in Scotland for more than two decades. It was nearly two centuries later that the MacGregors acquired Edinchip, in 1778, building the current Edinchip House in 1830.Welcome to Clan Gregor Language Lochearnhead is a post-Gaelic speaking area. According to the Old Statistical Account of 1799, Scottish Gaelic was the language of the \\"common people\\" of the area, although it also tells us that in the spring the young men would go herding in the \\"low country\\" (around Stirling), where they would \\"have the advantage of acquiring the English language\\". This would in fact have been the Scots language of the Stirlingshire area, rather than Standard English.\\"Parish of Balquhidder\\", Old Statistical Account of Scotland, Vol. 12, 1799. By 1837, the New Statistical Account tells us that in the area, \\"Gaelic is the language generally spoken, but it has been rather losing ground within the last forty years\\".\\"Parish of Balquhidder\\", New Statistical Account of Scotland, Vol. 10, 1837. At the time of the 1881 Census, when a question about Gaelic was included for the first time, there were still more than 70% in the parish with Gaelic as their first language, and even some with Gaelic as their only language.Gàidhlig (Scottish Gaelic) Local Studies, Volume 27: Siorrachd Pheairt & Sruighlea (Perthshire & Stirling) Linguae Celticae Regular church services were held locally in Gaelic up until 1930,Beauchamps, E, (1981), The Braes O' Balquhidder, Heatherbank Press. Today the generation which remembers native Gaelic being spoken is fast dying out, and any Gaelic speakers are likely to be either learners or incomers from Gaelic-speaking heartlands. To this day, though, \\"Church Gaelic\\" is based on the Perthshire Gaelic dialect.Gaelic, Scottish Ethnologue The first Gaelic Bible was translated by Balquhidder minister Robert Kirk.Antiquarian Books :: ILAB-LILA :: International League of Antiquarian Booksellers Legends and folklore=Each uisge It is said that a water horse, or each-uisge, inhabits Loch Earn, having been chased, in some variants of the legend, out of Loch Tay and across the hills by Fingal. This creature would entice people to ride on its back, but the rider's hands would stick to the creature's neck, and the unfortunate soul would be dragged under water by the Each Uisge to drown. The unpredictable currents in Loch Earn may have given a ring of truth to this legend. Fairies The hillock in the Games Field, known as Chieftains' Mound or the Shian (an Sitheann), is said to be a fairy knoll. (Sídhe, sìth or siodhe refers to earthen mounds that were thought to be home to the fairy folk.) In less cynical times, people attuned to the supernatural were said to report green light emanating from it, or to hear the strains of fairy music coming from within.Fairy Knolls in Scotland Edinample Castle, haunted and cursed Edinample Castle has several legends attached to it. The best-known is that 'Black' Duncan Campbell, a man known for his fury and his ornery nature, had asked the architect to build the castle with a parapet, but on discovering that there was not one threw the hapless architect off the roof to his death. His ghost is said to haunt the castle, wandering around the roof where the parapet should have been. The building and its inhabitants are also said to be cursed. Depending on which version is told, this curse is either a result of a witch's malediction, or because gravestones were used as building materials. Yet another legend has it that the 6th century holy man, Saint Blane, cursed the lands and the previous building said to have stood on the spot. Ardvorlich severed head The following gruesome tale is factual, but is included here in a section on legends since it is recounted for its sensational nature, and because it provided the inspiration for Sir Walter Scott's tale, \\"A Legend of Montrose\\". It was the custom to provide hospitality to anyone who asked for food and shelter. In accordance with this custom, Lady Margaret Stewart at Ardvorlich, pregnant at the time, gave hospitality to some travelling MacGregors. However, they had just come from murdering her brother, John Drummond of Drummonderinoch, and while she was out of the room placed his severed head on a silver platter, and placed in his mouth some of the cold victuals she had served them. She was so distraught that she ran out to the hills and gave birth to James Stewart, later known as Mad Major. The lochan she gave birth by is known as Lochan na Mna, the Lochan of the Woman, on the side of Beinn Domhnuill. Major James Stewart is one of the great historical characters of the Covenanting Wars and is the hero of Sir Walter Scott's novel A Legend of Montrose, in which he changed James Stewart's name to Allan Macauley. This name is actually engraved on the foot of Major Stewart's gravestone in the Stewarts of Ardvorlich old kirk of Dundurn just outside the village of St Fillans on the shores of Loch Earn.Stewarts of Ardvorlich Development of communications Like many highland communities, until the coming of the military road, Lochearnhead consisted of little more than a scattered collection of cottages, crofts, and the more prosperous farms associated with the estates. The first part of the old Lochearnhead Hotel was built in 1746,Cameron, E, (1994), \\"Strathyre, Balquhidder & Lochearnhead in old photographs\\", Stirling District Libraries. taking advantage of the improving communications. Before that, the area had been served by the much smaller and more primitive Lochearnhead Old Inn, which stood opposite where the village shop is now, and whose ruins were still in evidence until they were demolished in the 1980s, due to their dangerous condition. The military road\\"Military Roads In Scotland\\" Scots History Online was built in the aftermath of the Jacobite risings, and its coming, along with the hotel, gave focus to the village centre, until then little more than a few houses at the junction between the old roads that ran along the routes of the current A84 and A85. One of the original drove routes south ran down Glen Ogle and along the northern side of Loch Earn to Crieff. When the market was switched to Falkirk in around 1700, the main route ran south from Lochearnhead.A. R. B. Haldane (1952) The Drove Roads of Scotland, Thomas Nelson and SonsThe Highland Drovers A minute of the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, dated 3 April 1714, sets aside monies for the founding of a school at Lochearnhead. This is the old school, now a dwelling, which stands on the roadside by what was known as the Loanie, a track running beside the old Raven's Croft. The Loanie was blocked off when the houses comprising what is now Ravenscroft Road were built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1750, work began on the military road from Stirling to Fort William. This ran by Callander, Lochearnhead and Tyndrum and when it was completed, the village rose in prominence. A Post Office was opened in 1800. According to the Minute Book of the Deacons Court of the Free Church, between the founding of the Free Church of Scotland, as a result of the Disruption of 1843, and the starting of the minute book in 1846, Lochearnhead had a Free Church, a Church School and a Manse. The church passed back to the Church of Scotland after the reunion of 1929, and fell out of use in the 1970s. It is now a dwelling house. The Manse is now the Mansewood Country House Hotel. The school referred to is the current school, situated on School Lane, behind the village hall. It was the coming of the railways that had the greatest effect on the village. In 1870, the Callander and Oban Railway, was completed and in 1904 the railway was extended along Loch Earn to St Fillans and Crieff, making Lochearnhead an easy place to visit (while the railway junction was actually at Balquhidder, to the south, until the opening of Lochearnhead station on the new line Balquhidder station was called Lochearnhead). With the rise in Scottish tourism in Victorian times, the town became a popular destination from which tourists could enjoy the tranquility of Loch Earn. A number of small hotels were built around 1900. A motor vessel, the Queen of Loch Earn, plied the loch from 1922 until 1936, after which she was moored at St Fillans and used as a houseboat.Ransom, P. J. G. (1994), Loch Earn. The railways were short-lived and with the rise of motor transport, the St Fillans rail line closed in 1951.A. R. B. Haldane (1962) New Roads through the Glens, David & Charles, Newton Abbot Although Beeching cuts included for the closure of the main line in 1965, it was actually closed because of landslides in Glen OgleForgotten Railways of Scotland; John Thomas () pp 127 to 131 shortly before the planned closure date. The rockfall itself was a very minor affair, and has nothing to do with the many boulders visible above and below the line, which have been there for thousands of years, however in response to the local minister offering to clear it up, it was alleged by British Rail engineers that there was a great risk of a larger amount of material coming down.Picture of actual landslide This was publicised on TV at the time. This prediction has not yet happened, and it was notable that nothing significant happened to that side of the valley in August 2004.The Scotsman article on the railway line August 2004 saw more landslides, this time across the glen from railway line. The road was engulfed in mud, after unusually heavy and prolonged rain, trapping several motorists, and bringing the attention of the national and international media as the world debated climate change and \\"wild weather\\".Glen Ogle mudslide BBC News August 2004 Recent developments The village has maintained its tourist status and has become a centre of water sports including water skiing, kayaking, canoeing, dinghy sailing and scuba diving. Loch Earn is particularly known for its water skiing and championships are held there. The old Lochearnhead Hotel, which was situated opposite the village green at the junction of the A84 and A85, was burned down in the early hours of November 5, 1982. The Cameron family then bought and renamed the Craigroystan hotel, which overlooks the loch. This new Lochearnhead Hotel has since changed ownership. The turbulent past The town has been witness to Scotland's turbulent past. A kilometre along the South Loch Earn road is Edinample Castle,Edinample Castle in winter built by 'Black' Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy in 1630.Edinample Castle, Lochearnhead Perthshire Scotland Campbells of Edinample Some three kilometres to the east is Ardvorlich House, home of the Stewarts of Ardvorlich since 1580. Near here is a tombstone for seven Macdonalds of Glencoe who were killed while attempting a raid on Ardvorlich House in 1620. Ardvorlich House Highland Games The Balquhidder, Lochearnhead, and Strathyre Highland Games and Gathering celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2007. The Games is held in Lochearnhead on the second last Saturday of July. Events include the hill race, track and field events, heavy events like the caber and weight throwing, piping and pipe bands and highland dancing competitions. It is an opportunity for friends and family who may have left for other parts to return to the village and catch up.Lochearnhead Highland Games The Findlater Sisters The Findlater Sisters, Jane Findlater (1866–1946), and Mary Findlater (1865–1963), were daughters of the Free Kirk Manse, and grew up in what is now the Mansewood Hotel. They wrote novels and short stories separately and together, and were very popular in their day. Jane's novels include The Green Graves of Balgowrie (1896), and her collections of short stories include Seven Scots Stories (1912). Mary wrote six novels, including The Rose of Joy (1903). Her short story \\"Void of Understanding\\" was broadcast as a BBC Radio Scotland production in the early 1990s. Both had stories included in the 1987 Polygon anthology The Other Voice: Scottish women's writing since 1808 (M Burgess, ed). Neither sister married, and they lived together until Jane died in 1946.Mackenzie, E, (1964) The Findlater Sisters: Literature and Friendship (London: John Murray).The Findlater Sisters Sheep shearing The annual sheep shearing competition, Lochearnhead Shears,Lochearnhead Shears was established in 1993, growing to become one of the largest sheep shearing competitions in the United Kingdom. The event attracts international competitors, who come to attempt to win the \\"Scottish Blackface Shearing Champion\\" title. Blackface sheep are the areas' main breed, these mountain sheep requiring the competitors to use particular skills. The competition is held in June, and normally culminates in a ceilidh dance. Hertfordshire Scouts Activity Centre The old station, now an activities centre In 1962, Hertfordshire Scouts opened their first activity centre in the former Lochearnhead station. After extensive refurbishment of the derelict site the station buildings were converted to include the facilities they required, including a kitchen and dining room. The centre was aptly named the Lochearnhead Scout Activity Station. Entrance to the station is just north of the village on a private slip road, with a large sign proclaiming the site of the station. The Glen Ogle trail runs on the northern side of the station and the station is clearly visible. The original subway entrance to the station now backs onto a modern housing estate on the A84/A85 junction and is used as storage for camping gear etc. A pathway through the housing estate to the junction provides foot access to the station with a small gate in the surrounding fenceline. Recently, the main station buildings have benefited from further refurbishment and now a collection of Scandinavian style log cabins surround the platform to the north, additional cabins provide further accommodation on the platform and surrounding areas while improvements in water and drainage connections have allowed improved washroom facililities. The current facilities provide comfortable accommodation for 82 people, with the Station building containing the Station Master's Office, commercial quality kitchen, large dining room, adjoining sun lounge, showers and toilets. The site also includes a second shower and toilet block as well as a dedicated sick bay, drying room and stores. While the main activities run from the station are mountain based, Hertfordshire Scouts also have the use of a small jetty on Loch Earn which is used during the summer holiday for dinghy sailing and kayaking activities. The station is in constant use throughout all the English school holidays, but the remainder of the time it is available for hire by other people. Walks There are two Munros on Loch Earn side, Ben Vorlich and Stuc a’Chroin. For more family-friendly walks, there is the Glen Ogle trail and Glen Ample. Glen Ogle Trail Glen Ogle can be walked as a circular route,Glen Ogle Trail starting on the Lochearnhead stretch of Millennium Cycle Route 7Millennium Cycle Route 7 along the Western side of Glen Ogle on the old high level railway, and returning down the floor of the glen. Alternatively, one can simply retrace one's steps on the cycle route. Many of the guides suggest starting from the Scout station, but that requires a very steep climb to the cycle route. A gentler start is from the Episcopal church at the bottom of Craggan Road. Following this single track road brings one to an old railway bridge, where the cycle route can be followed south towards Callander or north towards Killin. Turning towards Killin leads onto the Glen Ogle section. Glen Ample Walk Starting at Edinample Falls, on the south shore of Loch Earn, this is a ramble on a well established route, which varies from stony tracks to grassy paths, and leads through Glen Ample to Ardchullarie on Loch Lubnaig. One then needs to return on the same path, or arrange transport from Ardchullarie. There are two burns which need careful crossing after heavy rain. The walk is 14 km, taking about 4½ hours. The glen is not especially attractive, and its lower half is afforested; interest is added by two of the most remarkable 'rock slope failures' in the Highlands, on its east side. At the foot of Glen Ample, the entire hillside of Ben Our is the second largest landslip zone after Beinn Fhada in Kintail giving rise to a platy pattern of fractures well seen from Glenoglehead in low sun or thin snow; broken ground along the slopefoot supports native woodland. Near the head of Glen Ample, the slopes of Beinn Each (pronounced 'yuk') have broken out into an eggbox pattern. The glen follows the Loch Tay Fault, one of the most important in the Highlands, which continues north-east to Glen Tilt beyond Blair Atholl. The glen is thus a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.Jarman D (2007): \\"Glen Ample\\". In Mass Movements in Great Britain (ed.

It was a streamlined design, with rear hinged doors and conventional doors in the side, to access the engine bay. It was designed to have one such great loading capacity. Nine specially designed suitcases could be fitted into spaces in the back, and any compartments in the right front fender (the left fender contained spare tyre and tools). A second spare tyre, in the rear, was used as the bumper. The design was done by Gustaf Ericsson, whom was the son of Lars Magnus Ericsson. It was based on the chassis of the Volvo PV655, and the coachwork was done by Gustaf Nordbergs Vagnfabrik AB, in 1932. The name was a pun, referencing Venus de Milo, with bil meaning “automobile” in Swedish. The concept was one four door saloon, with four seats, and it led to the production model, Volvo PV 36 Carioca, which also was one four door saloon. The fate of the car, itself, is unknown. After World War II, it was sold to one person in Denmark. In the middle of the 1950s, it was owned by one scrapyard owner, in Denmark, who rebuilt it into one such pick up truck.

It is apparently extinct. Description and ecology Sitting on its nest, the Guadalupe storm petrel would have looked exactly the same as the Leach's storm petrel in this photo This species was almost indistinguishable from its relative, Leach's storm petrel. In the field, they could not be told apart except by their annual rhythm. In the hand, the Guadalupe storm petrel could be distinguished by slightly larger size and the paler underwing coverts. There is no evidence for sexual dimorphism in this species. It bred only on Guadalupe Island off Baja California, Mexico, and presumably ranged throughout the region. The breeding season was set between the two other breeding storm petrel species of Guadalupe, the winter-breeding Ainley's and the summer-breeding Townsend's, in accordance with Gause's law. The single egg, white with a faint ring of reddish-brown and lavender speckles around the blunt end, was laid in burrows maybe 15 in (35–40 cm) long, below the Guadalupe pine (Pinus radiata var. binata)-island oak (Quercus tomentella)Contrary to BirdLife International (2012), the birds were not associated with Guadalupe cypress woodland, which only occurs inland and at lower elevations. cloud forest on top of Mount Augusta. By mid-June, almost all young had already left the burrows. Though little data is available on Oceanodroma breeding, incubation was presumably 42 days or so in this species, just as in similar-sized relatives. Time to fledging must have taken between 60 and 75(−85?) days, most likely around 65 days. This would mean that egg-laying took place from early February to March, and that in April–May, unfledged young were present in most active burrows. Just as in their relatives, the egg was incubated a few days by either parent, after which the other took over, the relieved bird taking to the sea to feed itself for the next incubation stint. The young were fed only at night, also like in other storm petrels. Its call was described by Walter E. Bryant as sounding something like \\"here's a letter, here's a letter\\", with repeated interjections of \\"For you, for you\\". Three species of lice were found to parasitize the Guadalupe storm petrel: the menoponids Longimenopon dominicanum and Austromenopon oceanodromae, and the ischnoceran Halipeurus raphanus. The second also occurs on some other storm petrels, and the third was also found on the ashy storm petrel. L. dominicanum, though, has to date not been found on other birds and seems to be a case of coextinction. Disappearance Illustration from 1907 In January 1885 multiple specimens were collected and described by Walter E. Bryant. The introduction of cats to the island decimated the population during the late 19th century. Introduced goats were also responsible for degradation of the environment. By the end of the 1906 breeding season, it was still considered \\"abundant\\", though the \\"large numbers\\" of birds present there and then must have been nearly the entire population of this species. Still, it was noted that: > the mortality among these birds from the depredations of the cats that > overrun the island is appalling – wings and feathers lie scattered in every > direction around the burrows along the top of the pine ridge. The last two specimens were supposedly collected between May 2 and May 5, 1911, and the last record of a breeding bird was in 1912. The species has not been seen since. Only old, abandoned burrows and the decayed remains of storm petrels killed by cats were found in the years thereafter. However, the Guadalupe storm petrel cannot be distinguished from the sympatric O. leucorhoa in the field, and surveys on Guadalupe invariably took place outside the breeding season of O. macrodactyla, focusing on researching the local Leach's storm petrels. Thus, some hope remained for the present species' survival, or rather, its extinction could not be definitely confirmed. From June 4 to June 10, 2000, the Guadalupe storm petrel's breeding grounds were finally surveyed at the correct time. Had the species survived, not only would recently fledged immature birds have been present, but also all signs of a recently ended breeding season, such as eggshells and freshly used burrows retaining the musky smell of these birds. In the words of the expedition's primary researcher, Exequiel Ezcurra of the San Diego Natural History Museum, > We searched thoroughly for the Guadalupe storm petrel, and failed to find > it. Sadly, we are now more ready to admit that the species is indeed > extinct. Never, since the 1920s, had so much search effort been devoted to > this species. At different times, more than 10 researchers looked for the > elusive creature. It simply was not there. The official classification by the IUCN has not been updated yet. In any case, the precautionary principle would probably require a few years of follow-up surveys, possible now that restoration of Guadalupe's ecosystem is underway. Despite the species' likely extinction, the two other storm-petrel species that are also endemic breeders to Guadalupe - Townsend's and Ainley's storm petrels - still survive on offshore islets.

The episode was first broadcast on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before Armistice Day. Apart from the one-off short film Blackadder: Back & Forth made a decade later, it was the last episode of Blackadder to be produced and transmitted. The episode depicts its main characters' final hours before a British offensive on the Western Front of the First World War, and Captain Blackadder's attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after he fails to convince General Melchett, and Field Marshal Haig's advice proves useless, he resigns himself to taking part in the push. \\"Goodbyeee\\" has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in machine-gun fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of gallows humour, its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves. Richard Curtis and Ben Elton wrote the episode, and further material was provided by cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going \\"over the top\\", uses slow motion, as the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending. The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant.https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackaddergoesforth/ Plot=Background Rowan Atkinson played Captain Blackadder in the series. Each series of Blackadder depicts its protagonist, always a scheming and (except in the first series) witty man named Edmund Blackadder, in different periods throughout history. In Blackadder Goes Forth, he is Captain Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), an officer in the British Army on the Western Front during the First World War. Joined by his colleagues—the poor, stupid and unhygienic Private Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and the overly optimistic, upper-class and equally idiotic Lieutenant George St Barleigh (Hugh Laurie)—Blackadder tries constantly to escape his position and avoid the \\"big push\\", which he fears will result in his death. His efforts are hindered by the loud and intimidating General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Melchett's strict, sardonic, and jobsworth staff officer, Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny). Events Captain Blackadder's trench receives a phone call from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick. Melchett leaves after George declines his offer not to participate in the push, and Baldrick suggests that Blackadder ask Field Marshal Douglas Haig to get them out; remembering that Haig owes him a favour, Blackadder decides to call in the morning. George, Baldrick and Blackadder discuss the War and the friends they have lost—George mentions the Christmas truce of 1914 (in which the belligerents stopped fighting to play football) and realises he is the only \\"Trinity Tiddlers\\" member still alive; this is paralleled in Baldrick's pets, who have all died. Back at HQ, Melchett surprises Captain Darling with a front-line commission. Darling's pleas to reconsider are misinterpreted, and Melchett insists that he go. The following morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and reminds him of his debt; Haig reluctantly advises using the underpants method, and abruptly hangs up, sealing Blackadder's fate. Darling arrives, and his animosity with Blackadder dissolves as they are both put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others. Darling states that he had hoped to live through the War, return to England and marry his fiancée. The men are called to the trench to prepare for the big push. There is a moment of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, but for the first time in any series, does not call it a \\"cunning plan\\". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign insanity because \\"who would have noticed another madman round here?\\" The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard. Production The episode was written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped computer disks to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could not add back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of Blackadder Goes Forth during read-throughs. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started;Lloyd, John. Audio commentary for \\"Goodbyeee\\" in Blackadder Remastered: The Ultimate Edition (DVD). 2 Entertain. 2009. the running gag of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals. The episode's title is a reference to the popular First World War song \\"Good-bye-ee!\\", which was based on a catchphrase of the comedian Harry Tate. The song is also heard in an earlier episode — \\"Major Star\\". The title is a departure from those of previous Blackadder Goes Forth episodes, which are puns on military ranks. During the filming of the episode, which took place before a studio audience at BBC Television Centre, Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a \\"knot in the pit of my stomach\\",Atkinson, Rowan. Audio commentary for \\"Goodbyeee\\" in Blackadder Remastered: The Ultimate Edition (DVD). 2 Entertain. 2009. something that he had never experienced. Hugh Laurie said that filming was sad because \\"even for comic effect, we were representing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people\\". Regarding guest star Geoffrey Palmer, the producer John Lloyd said \\"[We] probably could have given [him] more attention\\", calling him \\"a wonderful actor\\" who is \\"really just delivering three or four plot lines [pieces of dialogue essential to the plot]\\". The slow motion and fade effects at the end of the episode were not scripted, but the decision to use them was made in editing after the final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing polystyrene set, ruining the poignancy of the sequence; the episode's director Richard Boden added the poppy field image. The piano version of the theme tune was performed by Howard Goodall and recorded in a gymnasium, giving it what Lloyd described as a \\"liquid, lonely sound\\". The episode's end credits were omitted. Tim McInnerny did not know about these changes before the episode aired, and has said that he found the ending particularly emotional. Themes In the episode, Field Marshal Haig is shown casually sweeping away toy soldiers with a dustpan and brush; BBC News Magazines Finlo Rohrer called this a \\"visual allusion to his callousness\\", but quoted the historian Gary Sheffield as saying \\"The real Field Marshal Haig was certainly not a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did, you ended up with lots and lots of casualties.\\" Sheffield also noted that \\"Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and John French and the other generals\\", so Haig effectively \\"appears twice\\". The series, especially the storyline of \\"Goodbyeee\\", often depicts the \\"lions led by donkeys\\" perception of the War, an element of Blackadder Goes Forth that has been criticised by historians. In his book The Great War, Ian F. W. Beckett also cited Sheffield: the latter commented that Blackadder Goes Forth was successful because \\"the characters and situations needed no explanation, so familiar was the audience with the received version of the war\\". Beckett noted the popularity of the episode's final scene, and compared it to a similarly popular scene from Dad's Army. He said that this comparison demonstrates the observation made by historian A. J. P. Taylor that the Second World War has been regarded as a \\"good war\\" in comparison to the first; he opined that \\"television producers...have much to answer for in the perpetuation of the image of the Great War as one in which a generation of 'lions' were needlessly sacrificed by the 'donkeys'\\". The ending shows a field of poppies to reflect on the deaths of soldiers; it was inspired by alt=A tranquil field of red poppies, and the text \\"Blackadder\\" with a copyright notice Producer John Lloyd cited the episode's lack of another major character as the reason they had time to \\"explore the relationships of the five principal people\\". Atkinson said that the scene involving Darling's \\"ghastly realisation\\" of his commission was \\"very sad\\"; Lloyd commented \\"I love the fact that Captain Darling does have some compassion; he's not just a bureaucrat\\". They noted that \\"all the comedy just goes away\\" upon Darling's arrival in the trench, and that \\"there are still funny moments, but dramatically, there is no comic content, it is just leading inexorably to the end.\\" Comparing the ending scene to those of previous series of Blackadder, in which the main characters were also killed, writer Curtis commented: \\"I think it was by chance that [previous series] ended with Blackadder being killed...but series four, we did do it very much on purpose.\\" He said that he and Elton felt they could use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering \\"if we did do that...it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War\\". Reception Following its original broadcast on BBC1 at 9:30 pm on 2 November 1989, \\"Goodbyeee\\" was praised for its powerful and memorable ending. One journalist called the scene \\"a classy ending to a television classic\\", and the Sunday Times said that it was \\"brave\\" and \\"properly responsible\\" of the writers to end the series poignantly, especially when the episode aired close to Remembrance Day. \\"Goodbyeee\\" has also been the subject of more recent reviews: Rob Cromwell of The Guardian listed the final scene among six \\"perfect end-of-show finales\\", saying of Blackadder: \\"It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds\\", and praising the writers and producer Lloyd for \\"deliver[ing] a perfectly pitched, poignant ending\\". Comparing Blackadder Goes Forth to the 2012 war serial Birdsong, Alison Graham of the Radio Times commented that \\"Nothing...evokes the terror of those unspeakable battlefields or leaves such an overwhelming sense of loss as [its characters] going over the top to their certain death\\". Den of Geek's Carley Tauchert placed the episode second on her list of \\"top 10 TV show endings\\", calling it \\"one of the greatest interpretations of the madness of war that has ever been put on film\\". Reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, Kate Kulzick described it as \\"...a masterpiece, a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything Blackadder does well. It is without a doubt the best episode of the series and more than that, it is one of the best series finales in television history\\". She particularly praised it for \\"...its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Both are interspersed throughout, with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection\\", concluding that \\"...there is no such thing as a perfect television show or episode, but “Goodbyeee” comes dang close\\". The academic and theatre director Mary Luckhurst contrasted the regular British comedic treatment of the Second World War with the absence of comedies set in the First World War, until the Blackadder series, which she considered \\"an important British dramatic treatment\\" of the War. Of the final episode Luckhurst wrote: > \\"Goodbyeee\\" went a good deal further than any other sitcom or comedy, by > terminally sending pretty much the entire cast over the top in 1917, into a > silence that has...endured ever since. Many millions of viewers were > shocked, and almost all taken aback by the abrupt realization of tragedy > amid much-loved national television and after riotous laughter to that > sudden and bitter end ... In a poll conducted by Channel 4 and The Observer to determine television's one hundred most memorable moments, the final scene of \\"Goodbyeee\\" came ninth; it was one of only two entries in the top ten that was not news coverage (the other being a scene from Only Fools and Horses). In 2001, Radio Times asked a panel of comedians, writers and producers to pick their ‘50 favourite sitcom moments’; \\"Goodbyeee\\" was the only episode of Blackadder that was included, where it ranked eleventh. The British Film Institute's Screenonline called the episode's ending \\"unexpectedly moving\\", and noted that, unusually for a comedy programme, it was repeated as part of a serious commemoration of Armistice Day: for its 80th anniversary in 1998. The series' overview from the website of UKTV's channel Gold, which airs repeats of Blackadder, calls the final episode \\"a seamless blend of gallows humour and rich poignancy\\" and \\"a fitting end to an iconic series\\". In his segment advocating for Blackadder to be voted Britain's Best Sitcom, broadcaster and journalist John Sergeant called the final sequence \\"the one sitcom moment with claims to immortality\\". Some historians of the First World War have taken a different view. William Philpott referred to the series, by name, as \\"bathetic\\" and felt it part of a \\"post-facto generalisation of the nature of their war\\" that \\"sucked in\\" even veterans of the conflict; in other words, the First World War soldier had become a \\"victim\\" in the public consciousness, a circumstance at odds with the historical record. The impact of Blackadder on the public consciousness was so pervasive that Gordon Corrigan referenced it in his book cover copy when he published Mud, Blood, and Poppycock, which was an attempt to \\"dispel various myths\\" about the war.google books website The copy noted that \\"Corrigan's brilliant, witty history reveals how out of touch we have become with the soldiers of 1914-18. They simply would not recognize the way their generation is depicted on television...\\" See also * 1989 in British television * List of Blackadder episodes * War in popular culture Notes=FootnotesCitations=References * * External links * \\"Goodbyeee\\" at BBC Programmes  The final scene on YouTube Category:1989 British television episodes Category:Blackadder episodes Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton Category:British television series finales Category:Fiction set in 1917 Category:Cultural depictions of Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig Category:Television shows written by Richard Curtis ","title":"Goodbyeee"},{"id":"4465984","text":"Cynthia Maung ( ; born 6 December 1959) is a Burmese medical doctor and founder of Mae Tao Clinic that has been providing free healthcare services for internally displaced persons (IDP) and migrant workers on the Thai-Burmese border for three decades.

Early life and education  Cynthia Maung was born to ethnic Karen parents Mahn Nyein Maung and Hla Kyi in Rangoon, and grew up in Moulmein with her parents and 6 siblings. Cynthia attended State High School No. 4 and it was during this period that political upheaval and the student movement began to cause disruptions to the education system in Burma. Maung found that many of her friends were dropping out of school, as they needed to work in order to make a little money to assist their family. In 1977, the Burmese government began to make changes to the educational system which affected universities and colleges, and there were more disruptions to the school year. Maung finished high school this year but had to wait for 10 months before being able to enter the Mawlamyine Regional College where she was required to spend two years before entering medical school. A further 10 months between the regional college and medical school meant that it was 1980 before she was able to commence her medical studies.  Medical career  After medical school, Maung undertook a one-year internship at the Mawlamyaing General Hospital. It was during this time that Maung began to realise how poor some people were and how much they had to sacrifice in order to get medical care. Many people sold their homes, property and land or animals so that a family member could receive medical assistance. But still they had to purchase their own supplies such as soap, blades and dressings if they required surgery. Equipment was old and often broken, and items such as syringes were repeatedly used. From there she went to work in a private clinic in Bassein in the delta area of Burma. It was during this time that the Burmese government decided to change the monetary system. Some of the currency became invalid and many people lost their life savings. This caused suffering for many people and especially for students and the poor. Some schools closed down and the student movement became stronger. Maung's mother became at this time and so she moved back to Moulmein to help care for her and to be close to her family. In 1987, Maung started working in a clinic in Eindu Village in Karen State. The village, which was on the main transit route between Hpa-An and Myawaddy was made up of three main ethnic groups: the Pa-O who earned their living mainly by weaving, the Mon who ran the small shops and businesses, and the Karen who made a small living from farming and agriculture. Living for all of these people was difficult and they all struggled to survive on a daily basis. Maung realised how poor the people were, how little they had and watched as they were forced into working for the military as soldiers and porters. Many village children were not able to attend school and from necessity helped the military in order to make a small amount of money so that they could survive. Taxation was high and diseases such as Tuberculosis widespread. The village had one small hospital but during her stay there was a doctor present for only 2–3 months and there were no medicine or supplies with which to treat the people. During 1988 the pro- democracy movement and demonstrations increased. Maung joined up with other villagers and high school and university students who had returned to the village. They tried to work together with similar groups from other parts of the country to bring about positive change in Burma. There was a lot of tension, and parents were worried about their children and their safety. Communication and transportation avenues were cut off and the price of rice and commodities went higher and higher. There was confusion and fear among the people. On 19 September 1988 the military seized power, many activists disappeared, fled the country, or were forced to go into hiding. Many thousands of people moved quickly to the Thai–Burma border. On 21 September Dr. Cynthia and fourteen of her colleagues decided it was time for them to go also. With few provisions or personal belongings, they fled through the jungle for seven days. They travelled mainly at night and as they passed through remote villages, where the people had never seen health workers or had access to a hospital, they tried to treat the local people suffering from disease and injury with the limited supplies that they carried.  Mae Tao Clinic  On arrival in Thailand, Dr. Maung and her friends stopped at Mae La, opposite Be Claw refugee camp in Tha Song Yars district. Here Maung worked at a small hospital treating those fleeing the fighting. There was a lot of confusion as thousands of people tried to find their friends and families. There were many people with many different political ideas, and illnesses such as malaria were rife. Later, Maung moved to Hway Ka Loke refugee camp and it was while she was here that she made contact with Karen leaders responsible for student affairs and with local Thai authorities and church groups who were sympathetic to the plight of these people. Together, they tried to set up some systems to lessen the confusion and to bring a little order to the situation in the area. In November 1988, Maung moved to Mae Sot. She wanted to set up a centre for students needing somewhere to stay or requiring referral for further medical care. Mae Sot had a hospital where this could be done and from this time the Clinic began to develop a referral system with the local hospital which continues today. In February 1989, she was offered a dilapidated building with bare dirt floors on the outskirts of Mae Sot. Here, Dr. Cynthia went to work. Her makeshift clinic had few supplies and money. She improvised by sterilizing her few instruments in a rice cooker and solicited medicine and food from Catholic relief workers working in the area. She and her companions lived simply and worked hard to treat the increasing number of patients coming to the clinic with malaria, respiratory disease and diarrhea as well as gunshot wounds and land mine injuries. Malaria cases are still one of the most common diseases treated by the Mae Tao Clinic. As the years have passed, the type of patient attending the clinic has also changed. In the beginning, it was mainly students and young people escaping the fighting. Gradually, migrant workers began to come to the area in an effort to find work and money for their families at home. As time passed, their wives and families joined them. Today, there are also many children and adolescents who are dropping out of school and need a place of safety. As the population changes, so do the medical needs of those that the clinic serves. Today, one of the highest patient loads is in Reproductive Health and associated areas. Each year, over 2,700 babies are delivered at the clinic. The clinic’s facilities and activities continue to grow. Currently, between 400 - 500 people on average come to the clinic each day, and there is a staff of about 700 providing comprehensive health services and child protection services. Total caseload exceeds 115,000 cases annually with a client number of over 75,000 per year.  Health services  Mae Tao Clinic provides inpatient and outpatient medical care for adults, children, reproductive health clients and surgical service patients. Other services include eye care, dental care, laboratory and blood bank services, prosthetics and rehabilitation, voluntary counseling and testing for HIV and counseling services. Severe cases (less than 1%) are referred to Mae Sot Hospital. Antiretroviral treatment and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV is also conducted in collaboration with Mae Sot Hospital. Since the establishment of the Clinic, Thai Ministry of Public Health, Mae Sot Hospital and Mae Tao Clinic share information and experiences and have developed a positive working relationship. The Clinic also supports small satellite clinics set up in Burma, particularly in the IDP areas, to assist those who cannot reach the Clinic.

As of June 2019, it is one of three international airports in the Maldives. History First built by the Royal Navy, and transferred to the Royal Air Force as RAF Gan, it was a military airbase used during World War II and until 1976. The British handed it over to the government and it was used as a domestic airport. Recently the airport has been upgraded to international standards in preparation for international flights with the opening of tourist resorts in the area. The airport was run by the Government of Maldives (GoM) with a human resource base consisting of civil servants along with technical assistance from Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL) until January 2010. In June 2009 a public enterprise by the name of Gan Airport Company Limited (GACL) was established by H.E. President Mohamed Nasheed as part of GoM's privatisation policy. GACL took over management of GIA in January 2010. A transitional stage followed with an administrative restructuring which also involved a formal transfer of existing civil servants into the company's new organizational structure. To promote tourism and other economic activity in the south a new venture was formed early in 2012 to further develop and expand GIA. A joint venture was formed between GACL, MACL and State Trading Organization Plc (STO). The new venture is Addu International Airport Pvt Ltd (AIA). Gan International Airport is now owned and managed by Addu International Airport Pvt Ltd. Facilities The airport lies at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 10/28 with a concrete surface measuring . Gan International Airport (GIA) is at the southern tip of the country, and allows international and domestic aircraft movements year-round. The Executive Terminal built for the SAARC summit in 2011 was taken over by Shangri-La's Villingili Resort and Spa for the arrival and departure of Shangri-La's guests at Gan. It was the first private executive terminal in the Maldives. Airlines and destinations As of July 2019, the following airlines offer regularly schedules services: Statistics As of February 2019, the only foreign operator to Gan is SriLankan Airlines, using Airbus A320 aircraft. Incidents and accidents * On 12 March 2019 a Maldivian Bombardier Dash 8 Q300 suffered a landing gear malfunction, due to which the plane circled around the airport for 1 hour. The plane landed safely but the landing gear was not fully retracted. This was the first ever incident to occur in Gan international airport.

It was a project which comprised many engine options for the testing of different fuel types. In this project Volvo experimented with light weight materials to build the engine, such as aluminium, magnesium and plastics. The engineers started work in 1979; they were given a clean sheet to create a car meant for the year 2000, maximizing low fuel consumption. Especially magnesium was used to a large extent; this was a result of Volvo's aborted Norwegian affair (Norway would take forty per cent of the company in return for cash and ten per cent of one of the North Sea oil fields). Norsk Hydro, one of the world's foremost magnesium producers provided the technical know-how. The wheels were developed in collaboration with Campagnolo.Verhelle, p. 6 The floor plate was a single plastic casting, to which aluminium and magnesium elements were glued. The steering was by Germany's ZF, while Moulton's Hydragas suspension was also installed.Verhelle, p. 8 Designed to weigh less than , the LCP achieved an EPA 56 mpg city/81 highway and 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 11 seconds and top speed. It used many components in aluminium, plastic and even a magnesium engine block. Volvo claimed that only of \\"traditional\\" materials were used.Verhelle, p. 9 There were two types of three-cylinder turbodiesel engines for this car, one was a magnesium 1.3-liter (1279 cc) powerplant developed together with British diesel specialists Ricardo, pushing and weighing , and a cast-iron 1.4-liter Elsbett (ELKO) engine with a KKK turbocharger that could run on a variety of fuels such as low-octane gasoline and sunflower oil (biodiesel).

A Volvo ECC. rear The Volvo ECC (Environmental Concept Car) was an executive luxury concept car built by Volvo in 1992. It was a design exercise in using recycled material and hybrid technology. It was powered by a hybrid electric and gas turbine engine. Many of its lines and general styling were used as inspiration for the first generation Volvo S80. The ECC set a new design language for future Volvo models from the S80 onwards, the most obvious styling feature being the stepped waistline, which was inspired by the similar feature on the 200 Series, whilst retaining some of the angular elements from the 700/900 ranges. The Volvo ECC was built on the Volvo P80 platform. In contrast to most production hybrids, which use a gasoline piston engine to provide additional acceleration and to recharge the battery storage, the Volvo ECC used a gas turbine engine to drive the generator for recharging. This type of engine has a higher thermodynamic efficiency than the conventional internal combustion engine with pistons. Also in Volvo's design, the fuel is evaporated and mixed with air before ignition. This provides a very low NOx emission. The driver can also switch between gas turbine electric and hybrid by switches on the dashboard. The maximum power available was , with 76 available for continuous use. It had a drag coefficient of 0.23. With the vehicle weighing approximately more than a conventional Volvo 850, acceleration from 0-60 mph (97 km/h) took 23 seconds in EV mode and 12.5 seconds with the turbine engaged. Top speed was . The vehicle's range on batteries alone was , and when combined with a full tank of fuel for the turbine, about . The Volvo ECC was debuted at a time when California was seeking Zero Pollution Vehicles (ZPV). With its gas turbine, the Volvo ECC was not a zero-emissions vehicle, and hence did not meet the needs of the time. With the focus now shifted away from true zero-emissions vehicles, many of the concepts tested in the ECC may prove of value in future concept and production vehicles.

Anderson pitched in 16 games at the AAA level before being called up by the Cubs. Anderson appeared in just 7 games for the Cubs, all relief appearances, and notched his first career save. Anderson was traded to the Boston Red Sox for a minor league pitcher on July 2, 2004. Despite not being on the World Series roster, he was rewarded for his contributions with a championship ring. In 2005, Anderson pitched in the Twins, Astros, Cubs and Devil Rays minor league systems. Between all four, Anderson compiled an 8-10 record in 27 games (25 starts). He had a 3.44 ERA despite a WHIP of 1.50 due to his walks (66) and hits (150) in 144 innings. Anderson last played in the Florida Marlins organization in . He was released after posting an ERA of 5.77 in 22 games. After his release, he retired from baseball. As of 2013, he works with Bobby McKinney in Western Branch Batting and Pitching Clinic. He is also coaching a team called the Mid-Atlantic Pirates Scout team.

The compilation also contains four completely new or re-worked songs which are \\"What Kind of Fool 2006\\", \\"The Empty Dancehall Revisited\\", \\"Keepsakes\\" (which has also been released as a download single) and \\"Raindrops\\". The sleeve-notes to this compilation are a no-holds barred history of the band which detail the failures and the mistakes as well as the triumphs. The \\"infamous\\" version of \\"Martha's Harbour\\" was a Top of the Pops performance featuring just Julianne Regan and Tim Bricheno which - as was usual BBC policy at the time - was mimed. Unfortunately the backing tape wasn't played to the performers and which meant that they couldn't hear what they were supposed to be miming to - whereas the TV audience could hear the song with the two of them just sitting there. They pick the song up to much studio audience applause mid-way through the second verse, when someone realised the mistake. \\"The Empty Dancehall Revisited\\" and \\"Raindrops\\" feature Bricheno playing on an All About Eve album for the first time since their second album Scarlet and Other Stories seventeen years beforehand. Marty Willson-Piper wasn't available for the Top of the Pops performance of \\"Farewell Mr Sorrow\\" so his part in the mime was taken by a roadie called Adam Birch.

The quiz ran initially at 6:40am - when the show began at 6:30am - then after the programme was extended to a 6am start, room was found for two rounds a day as the feature became one of the bigger audience pulls, so it was placed in a crucial 8:20am slot. The basic premise was that Mayo, along with all or some of his \\"crew\\" (female co-host, newsreader, producer) would \\"act out\\" a scene of just seconds in length, the circumstances of which led listeners cryptically to the title of a well-known hit song, from any era. Sometimes sound effects alone were enough to get the clue across; such as when a long clip of a car being driven was played without any deviation in noise for junctions or distractions - hence the correct answer of Road To Nowhere by Talking Heads; or when effects of a heartbeat and a door opening were played in unison - hence the correct answer of Room In Your Heart by Living In A Box. Memorably, a woman character who gave her name only as \\"Mrs Day\\" once rang up and appeared entirely to misunderstand the competition. The cryptic clue running was a clip of the Blue Danube waltz by Strauss, interspersed with rodent-like chattering noises. Mrs Day just thought the answer was the Blue Danube, and Mayo patiently explained to her on air that the competition was slightly more difficult than that. The lady certainly seemed to have happened upon the quiz by accident (she didn't \\"sound\\" like a demographically-targeted Radio 1 listener of archetype) and Mayo referred to her in a joking manner for several rounds thereafter. It's possible that the chattering noises could have been misinterpreted for interference on the medium wave which many Radio 1 listeners were still relying on for coverage, with the new FM signal of the time still not yet covering the whole nation. The true correct answer turned out to be Batdance by Prince. The voice of the Identik-Hit Quiz production package was supplied by Mayo's Radio 1 colleague Bruno Brookes (who had to ditch it and use a generic one when he frequently acted as Mayo's holiday relief) and then later another colleague, Simon Bates. Having used this piece of production as the announcement of the quiz, Mayo would then play the cryptic clip, give the phone number and state what was up for grabs for a correct answer - this prize was in the form of record tokens (later CD tokens when vinyl records began to become obsolete) starting at one on the first day of a new quiz and increasing by one each day until a correct answer was given. Three callers were taken in each round, with Mayo knowing in advance the answer each were going to give. Mayo would ask each caller who they were, where they were from and - due to habit, tradition, and to give his female co- host a chance to update her forecasts - what the weather was like in their area. He would then take their answer and tell them if they were right or wrong. One Identik-Hit Quiz ran for so long that Mayo was forced to give extra clues at one point; then he went on a period of paternity leave for several weeks, only for the same cryptic clue still to be running on the quiz when he returned. The round in question featured newsreader Rod McKenzie supposedly falling (McKenzie giving a scream) into water (loud splash). Eventually the answer was finally given by a listener as Islands In The Stream (for the cryptic purposes of the quiz it was \\"I Lands In The Stream\\") by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. Whenever a correct answer was given, Mayo would play a congratulation stab of You! Are! A! Winner! before playing the record in question. After the record, he would then explain the cryptic clue in as little or much detail as deemed necessary. If a round of the Identik-Hit Quiz was guessed during a relief presenter's time on the show (including Brookes, Phillip Schofield, Mark Goodier and Gary King) then the new round would feature the voice (if applicable to the clue) of that presenter and would continue on numerous occasions even after Mayo had returned. This came in as a handy bit of further exposure for the relief presenter in question, especially if like King or Schofield, their own shows were at considerably non-peak hours (King at the time was on the pre-Mayo early shift; Schofield had one evening show and a Sunday show). The Identik-Hit Quiz has ended its run after Mayo left the breakfast show in 1993 and became the new mid-morning host. He left Radio 1 in 2001 and Radio 2 in 2018, and he now works for BBC Radio 5 live and Scala Radio.

Initially working under the name Chris Judge Smith, he has been known simply as Judge Smith since 1994. After Van der Graaf Generator, he has written songs, stage musicals and operas, and from the early 1990s on he has released a number of solo CDs, including three \\"Songstories\\".  Biography = Early years  In 1967, with Peter Hammill, Judge Smith founded the band Van der Graaf Generator. He was originally a singing drummer and percussionist (sometimes playing a typewriter),Christopulos & Smart, p. 12 and 21.Album notes for four-double CD box The Box by Van der Graaf Generator (2000), page 6. Virgin Records but after drummer Guy Evans joined the band, Smith realized that there wasn't a great deal left for him to do, since his role was reduced to being a harmony singer.Christopulos & Smart, p. 28. After recording the first Van der Graaf Generator-single (\\"People You Were Going To\\" b/w \\"Firebrand\\"), Smith amicably left the band in 1968. He went on to form a jazz-rock band called Heebalob, which included saxophonist David Jackson, who would later join Van der Graaf Generator.Christopulos & Smart, p. 50. After the demise of Heebalob, Smith pursued a solo career, and wrote and recorded many songs, some of which appeared on his (currently unavailable) first solo album Democrazy (1991). Smith also wrote several stage musicals as lyricist with composer Maxwell Hutchinson. These included The Kibbo Kift (produced at the Traverse Theatre for the Edinburgh Festival of 1976 and at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield the following year) and The Ascent Of Wilberforce III (subtitled \\"The White Hell of Iffish Odorabad\\", and produced at the Traverse Theatre, in 1981, and at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, London in 1982). His own chamber opera, The Book Of Hours, was directed by Mel Smith at the Young Vic Theatre, London in 1978. Mata Hari (staged at the Lyric Theatre in 1982), was his last musical, co-written with Lene Lovich and Les Chappell, and starring Lovich. Around 1973, Smith, together with Van der Graaf Generator co- founder Peter Hammill, began work on an opera based on the short story The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe, Smith writing the libretto and Hammill composing the music.Christopulos & Smart, p. 157. The album was finally released in 1991 on Some Bizzare Records, with a cast of singers including Lene Lovich, Andy Bell, Sarah Jane Morris and Herbert Grönemeyer. A reworked version, titled The Fall Of The House Of Usher – deconstructed & rebuilt, was released on Hammill's Fie! label in 1999. The new version is notable for having a cleaner, better produced sound, additional guitars and (unlike the first version) no percussion.Album notes for The Fall Of The House Of Usher – deconstructed & rebuilt (1999). Fie! Peter Hammill has recorded a number of songs written by Smith, including \\"Been Alone So Long\\" (on Nadir's Big Chance, 1975), \\"Time for a Change\\" (on pH7, 1979) and \\"Four Pails\\" (on Skin, 1986), and plays them live on a regular basis. Lene Lovich also recorded songs written by Smith, including \\"What Will I Do Without You\\" and \\"You Can't Kill Me\\" (both on Flex, 1979). In 1974 Smith wrote and directed a short film titled The Brass Band, which has won several international awards. Smith also wrote music for the television comedy series Not The Nine O'Clock News in the 1980s, including the punk rock parody \\"Gob on You\\".  Recent years  In 1993 Dome Of Discovery was released, Smith's first CD proper. Apart from the vocals, virtually every note on the album came from the sampled sounds of real instruments. Smith spent months making his own samples, hiring various musicians and recording individual notes. Since 2006, a remastered version has been available for download at iTunes. After many years of work developing a new form of narrative music he calls \\"Songstory\\", Smith completed and released, in 2000, the double CD Curly's Airships, about the 1924 Imperial Airship Scheme and the R101 airship disaster of 1930. Among many others, Peter Hammill, Hugh Banton, Arthur Brown, David Jackson, John Ellis and Pete Brown performed on the project. Smith believes that the 2 hr 20 min work might be the largest and most ambitious single piece of rock music ever recorded.Album notes for Curly's Airships (2000). Masters Of Art. Curly's Airships was to be the first of three Songstories so far written and composed by Smith. On the same day that Van der Graaf Generator played their reunion concert in the Royal Festival Hall in London, 6 May 2005, Smith played an afternoon concert at the Cobden Club in London. At this concert his new album, The Full English was launched, and Smith played (among others) all the songs from the album. He was accompanied by John Ellis on electric guitar, Michael Ward-Bergeman on accordion and René van Commenée on percussion. A DVD recording of a concert by Smith in Guastalla, Italy, Live In Italy 2005, was released on DVD on 20 March 2006. 2006 also saw the release of The Vesica Massage, an album of instrumental music designed for use by massage therapists. In October 2007 Smith released a two-song single CD, \\"The Light of the World\\" / \\"I Don't Know What I'm Doing\\", under the name of The Tribal Elders. This band consisted of Judge Smith, David Jackson, John Ellis, Michael Ward-Bergeman and Rikki Patten. In January 2008 the full-length album Long-Range Audio Device was released, under the name of L-RAD, a collaboration between Judge Smith and American artist Steve Defoe. Defoe is a founder of The Larry Mondello Band, who released numerous cassette tapes of their lo-fi music in the 1980s and 1990s. In May 2009 Smith performed the premiere of his second songstory, The Climber (written in 2005). The work was performed with a Norwegian male-voice choir, the Fløyen Voices, and no other instruments apart from a double bass, at USF Verftet in Bergen, Norway. A studio recording was released on 17 May 2010. Between 2007 and 2011 Smith and David Jackson performed their piece The House That Cried six times live in Italy, with a choir and orchestra. Smith released his third songstory, Orfeas, on 9 May 2011. It is a retelling of the ancient myth of Orpheus, performed by seven separate ensembles, each playing an entirely different kind of music. It features performances by, amongst others, John Ellis (as George Orfeas), Lene Lovich (as Eurydice) and David Jackson (as the saxophone player in the George Orfeas Band). Smith's album Zoot Suit was released 17 March 2013, a collection of songs, produced by David Minnick. The album includes a duet with Lene Lovich, a studio recording of \\"Been Alone So Long\\", an extract from The Book Of Hours, and a goodbye of sorts to recording, \\"I'm Through\\". In 2013, Smith published his first book, \\"The Universe Next Door\\", about life after death. It is subtitled \\"Book One of the Judex Trilogy\\". Book Two, \\"The Vibrating Spirit\\", was published in 2014. 2016 saw the release of the CD Requiem Mass, Smith's setting of the Latin Mass for the Dead, with lyrics in Latin. The Requiem Mass was originally written in 1975. It features performances by The Crouch End Festival Chorus, conducted by David Temple, a four-piece rock band, and baritone lead singer Nigel Richards.

Biography = Career  O'Neill was born in Sydney in 1974. He began cycling in 1989, when he attended a 16 kilometre handicap race before school, following the suggestion by a friend. The race started at 6am and O'Neill won it. He went on to win numerous medals in the junior ranks at the Australian National Track Championships. At the Junior UCI Track Cycling World Championships in 1992, O'Neill won the bronze medal as part of the team pursuit squad. In 1995, he won the silver medal in the road time trial at the Oceania Cycling Championships whilst nursing a broken pelvis. He was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.AIS Athletes at the Olympics From 1 September 1999, he rode for the Navigare – Gaerne team as a trainee rider before turning professional for the team in 2000 at the age of 25, under new sponsors Panaria – Gaerne. He represented Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics, finishing 19th in the individual time trial. He stayed with the same team for 2001–2002, under Panaria – Fiordo's sponsorship. O'Neill won the bronze medal in the individual time trial at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, United Kingdom. In 2003, O'Neill signed with the Saturn Cycling Team, 2004 for Colavita – Olive Oil, 2005 for Navigators Insurance Cycling Team and finally for Health Net Pro Cycling Team in 2006. At the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, 21 March 2006, O'Neill won the Gold Medal in the Time Trial finishing in a time of 48:37.29. He became the Australian National Time Trial Champion for the eighth time in January 2007, it was the fourth consecutive time.  Adverse Finding  On 12 August 2007, at the Tour of Elk Grove, O'Neill provided a sample which tested positive for the appetite suppressant drug phentermine. O'Neill received notification of this on 23 September 2007. Later, the B sample also tested positive, he admitted that he had used the medicine for the prescribed purpose out of competition. The drug was not banned for use out-of-competition, and O'Neill maintains that his error is due to a longer than expected clearance time for the drug, compounded by another supplement which increased his urinary pH that he was also taking in the days leading up to the event. On 6 November 2007, O'Neill was terminated by the Health Net Pro Cycling Team. On 13 June 2008 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that O'Neill bore \\"no significant negligence\\" in registering a positive finding for Phentermine, and was given a 15-month suspension, from 12 August 2007 – 12 November 2008. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the UCI jointly appealed to the CAS to increase the suspension period \\"on the grounds that the athlete had not demonstrated no significant fault or negligence\\". The CAS also stated that \\"Also of importance is the evidence from Mr O’Neill that he took the risk because he was of the view that without Phentermine he was not going to be competitive. Mr O’Neill therefore self- medicated with a view of gaining a competitive advantage.\\" The suspension was extended to the maximum period of two years, due to come to end on 13 June 2010. Personal life O'Neill currently lives with his girlfriend in Gainesville, Georgia, in the United States. In 2012, he founded Dingo Race Productions, LLC. Race productions include Mission Source Tour of the Southern Highlands, (formerly the Gainesville Gran Prix), and the Six Gap Criterium, among others. In 2016, Nathan joined Pioneer Cyclesports Division, as their technical representative in the Southeast. O'Neill has a daughter, born in 2006 to his former wife.

It is a central part of English land law in that it concerns town and country planning in the United Kingdom. Repealed in parts by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, it is now also complemented by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Contents In the United Kingdom, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 contains 15 parts with 337 sections, plus 17 Schedules, and serves as an incomplete, but expansive code of planning regulations in England and Wales. Part I, planning authorities Subsections 1 and 2 set out that county and district (county and county borough in Wales) councils are Local Planning Authorities ('LPA's) in non-metropolitan counties; that metropolitan district councils (usually unitary authorities) are LPAs in metropolitan counties and that different authorities govern Greater London and the Isles of Scilly. This is subject to sections 2 and 9. Subsection 1(3) states: \\"In England (exclusive of the metropolitan counties, Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) all functions conferred on local planning authorities by or under the planning Acts shall be exercisable both by county planning authorities and district planning authorities.\\" and is subject to Sch. 1. Subsection 1 (4) deals with mineral planning authorities. The exercise of functions in Wales is subject to Schedule 1A. This section is subject to sections 4A to 8. Section 2 allows the Secretary of State to join council planning authorities into joint planning boards. Under section 2A the Mayor of London may in circumstances prescribed in the Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order 2008/580 or directions under that order, direct that he is to be the local planning authority for the purposes of determining an application made under s 70 or s 73. Under section 2B the Mayor of London is to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State, must give reasons, must at that time send a copy of the direction to the applicant and to the Secretary of State. The Mayor may also become the planning authority for a connected application for Listed Building, Conservation Area or hazardous substances consent if he so considers. Under section 2C the Mayor of London after granting outline permission, may pass determination of reserved matters on to the original LPA (i.e. London Borough or Corporation of London). He may also do this for connected applications he grants 'subject to subsequent approval'. Section 2D enables secondary legislation related to the Mayor's planning powers. Section 2E passes the function from the LPA to the Mayor of agreeing a Planning Obligation related to a direction above after that time. The Mayor must consult the LPA before agreeing to one and both the LPA and Mayor may enforce it. Section 2F states that before determining an application, the Mayor of London must give the applicant and the local planning authority to whom the application was made an opportunity, with at least 14 days notice, to make oral representations at a hearing (“a representation hearing”). The Mayor must publish a procedural document for this. Section 3 retains the advisory joint planning committee for Greater London. Section 4A says that National Park Authorities (not all National Parks) are the sole local planning authority for the area of the Park except for functions in ss 198 to 201, 206 to 209 and 211 to 215 where the district planning authority for an area in the park shall share functions with the national park authority, who in such cases retain all their legal functions. Section 5 makes similar provision as 4A for the Broads Authority for land in that area. However, only for the purposes of Chapter I of Part VIII (Trees: Ss 197-214D) and sections 249, 250 and 300. Section 6 makes similar provision as 4A for Enterprise Zone Authorities for land in that area for such functions as a statutory Order may prescribe. Sections 7 to 8A make similar provision as 4A for Urban Development Corporations under the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980, Housing Action Trusts under Housing Act 1988 and the Urban Regeneration Agency under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 for their respective areas to the extent an appropriate order directs. Section 9 creates the power to make consequential and supplementary provision about authorities for land in that area for such functions as a statutory order may prescribe. Part II is now repealed and replaced by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. It used to concern larger scale Development Plans, in particular Unitary Development Plans in metropolitan areas including London and, for non- metropolitan areas, Structure Plans and Local Plans. Part III, Control Over Development Part III's concern with control over development focuses on effectively putting into public ownership, under democratically accountable regulation, all significant construction or demolition decisions by private landowners. This was seen necessary to ensure that private development did not run contrary to the community's interest. Section 59 states that \\"The Secretary of State shall by ... “development order”... provide for the granting of planning permission.\\" An initial application maybe for Outline Planning Permission as this allows the applicant to see whether an application is likely to be accepted before carrying out the costly work of preparing a full application. This will mean that there are other \\"reserved matters\\" to be resolved through one or more Detailed Planning Permission applications. =Section 106= Section 106 of the Act, in conjunction with DoE Circular 5/05, allows for local planning authorities and persons interested in land to agree contributions, arrangements and restrictions as Planning Agreements or Planning Obligations. Applicants can offer such agreements unilaterally or negotiate and agree them as support for their application to make it accord with local planning requirements, but without some of the rigorous controls of Planning Conditions under s 70(1). It relates to money paid by developers to local planning authorities in order to offset the costs of the external effects of development. For example, if a developer were to build 100 new houses, there would be effects on local schools, roads etc., which the local authority would have to deal with. In that situation, there might be a Section 106 agreement as part of the granting of planning permission. The agreement might also entail provisions about production of social housing. The developer might agree to make a contribution towards the provision of new schools or traffic calming on local roads. Section 106A has the effect that any modification or discharge of a s 106 Agreement must be agreed by deed between the parties and in accordance with s 106B. It creates the right to apply in a prescribed form to modify a s 106 agreement once five years has passed since the agreement, or such shorter period as secondary legislation may prescribe. It prevents one applicant applying for a modification which may become enforceable against others who have not applied. It clarifies that s 84 of the Law of Property Act 1925 (power to discharge or modify restrictive covenants affecting land) does not apply to a planning obligation. Section 106B contains the right of the applicant to appeal against the decision or non-determination of a local planning authority under s 106A to the Secretary of State. Section 106B states \\"before determining the appeal the Secretary of State shall, if either the applicant or the authority so wish, give each of them an opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for the purpose\\". It states \\"the determination of an appeal by the Secretary of State under this section shall be final\\". Schedule 6 applies to determine how the appeal is heard and by whom. Parts IV and V, Compensation Sections 107 to 118 deal with compensation for effects of certain orders, notices etc. The Planning and Compensation Act 1991 repealed sections 113 and 114, and all of Part V, in sections 119 to 136. It previously dealt with compensation for restrictions on new developments in limited cases. Part VI, right to be purchased Sections 137 to 171 deal with rights of the owner to require purchase of interests. Namely, interests affected by planning decisions or orders in certain circumstances and interests affected by planning proposals: serving blight notices. Part VII, enforcement Sections 172 to 196C deal with methods of enforcement of planning law. Part VIII, trees, amenity, adverts Sections 197 to 225 deal with Special Controls. Specifically, those for: *Trees *Land adversely affecting amenity of neighbourhood *Advertisements Section 215 of the Act empowers a local planning authority to issue a notice to the owner of land or a property where it adversely affects the local area, and the notice can specify what remedial action is required. Sub-section 1 states, It was under this provision that a notice was served in 2015 by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea on Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring, after the property developer had painted the front of her house in red-and-white candy cane stripes. However, following judicial review by the High Court of Justice, Mr Justice Gilbart ruled, Thus overturning the notice, and allowing Lisle-Mainwaring to keep the stripes on her house. Part IX, acquisition of land for planning Sections 226 to 246 deal with acquisition and appropriation of land for planning and public purposes. Also the extinguishment of certain rights, e.g. on burial places and constitution of joint bodies to hold land for planning purposes. Part X, highways A notice in Oxford made under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, section 247 to stop up a road. Sections 246 to 261 deal with highways. Sections 247 and 248 deal with the stopping up of highways. Part XI, statutory undertakings Sections 262 to 283 deal with statutory undertakers. These are persons authorised by any enactment to carry on any railway, light railway, tramway, road transport, water transport, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour, pier or lighthouse undertaking or any undertaking for the supply of hydraulic power and a relevant airport operator (within the meaning of Part V of the Airports Act 1986). Deemed statutory undertakers for sections 55, 90, 101, 108(3), 139 to 141, 143, 148, 170(12)(b), 236(2)(a), 237 to 241, 245, 247(4)(b), 253, 257(2), 263(1) and (2), 264, 266 to 283, 288(10)(a), 306, 325(9), 336(2) and (3), para.18 of Sch.1 and Schs. 8, 13 and 14 are any public gas transporter, water or sewerage undertaker, the National Rivers Authority, any universal postal service provider in connection with the provision of a universal postal service, the Civil Aviation Authority and a person who holds a licence under Chapter I of Part I of the Transport Act 2000 (air traffic services) shall be deemed to be statutory undertakers and their undertakings statutory undertakings. This applies with variations for a universal postal service provider and licence holders under section 6 of the Electricity Act 1989 or Chapter I of Part I of the Transport Act 2000. Part XII, Validity of plans Sections 284 to 292 deal with validity of development plans, some planning related orders, decisions, directions, enforcement and similar notices. Part XIII, Crown lands Sections 292A to 302 deal with the application the Act to Crown Land. Part XIV, financial provisions Sections 303 to 314 deal with financial provision. This includes application fees to the LPA, costs of certain inquiries, grants for research and education, contributions by ministers towards compensation paid by local authorities, contribution by local authorities and statutory undertakers, assistance for acquisition of property where objection made to blight notice in certain cases, recovery from acquiring authorities of sums paid by way of compensation, sums recoverable from acquiring authorities reckonable for purposes of grant, expenses of government departments, general provision as to receipts of Secretary of State and the expenses of county councils. Part XV, Miscellaneous Sections 303 to 337 deal with miscellaneous and general provisions. Note section 318 deals with ecclesiastic property, section 319 deals with the Isles of Scilly, section 300 provides a power to require information as to interests, section 333 deals with regulations and orders and section 336 deals with interpretation.

History=Sports Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. era Before its founding in 2005, and during a period from 1986 to August 2002, the company operated a franchise of golf equipment, formerly known as Sports Entertainment Enterprises. In August 2002 the company sold all of its former assets. From September 2002 to February 2005, the company's main priority was to pursue a transaction with a business enterprise. On March 25, 2005, Sports Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a CKX, Inc.'s shareholders voted overwhelmingly to change the company's name to CKX, Inc., to change the company's state of incorporation from Colorado to Delaware, and to increase the number of the company's authorized shares of capital stock from 105,000,000 to 275,000,000. The company's common stock would continue to trade under the stock symbol CKXE. CKx, Inc. era In 2005, it bought British company 19 Entertainment from Simon Fuller, who subsequently joined the company's board. With the purchase, the company acquired a majority share of the rights to the Idol series, including American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance, as well as Pop Idol in Great Britain and numerous other international versions. Later that year it bought an entertainment agency, with artists on its roster such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Woody Allen. On February 7, 2005, the company bought 85% interest in the entities which own and/or control the commercial utilization of the name, image and likeness of Elvis Presley, the operation of the Graceland museum and related attractions, as well as revenue derived from Elvis Presley's television specials, films and certain of his recorded musical works, from the trust of Lisa Marie Presley. On April 11, 2006, CKX, Inc. announced it has acquired an 80% interest in the name and likeness of Muhammad Ali. The transaction included the rights to the name, image and likeness of Mr. Ali, certain trademarks owned by Mr. Ali and his affiliates and the rights to all existing Ali license agreements. Mr. Ali, through affiliates, would retain a 20% interest in the business, which will be operated through a newly formed company named G.O.A.T. LLC. On March 7, 2007, CKX, Inc. announced its subsidiary, Muhammad Ali Enterprises LLC, acquired approximately 11,000 photographs of boxer Muhammad Ali from photographer Ken Regan. The images would be immediately available for licensing and editorial purposes. On June 1, 2007, CKX, Inc. announced it entered into a series of transactions that would result in the sale of the Company at a price of $13.75 per share in cash and the distribution to CKX stockholders of shares in FX Luxury Realty, LLC, an affiliate of Robert F.X. Sillerman. The total value for the takeover bid between Fuller and Sillerman would value the company at $1.3bn, but their attempt failed due to its timing coinciding with the start of the Global Credit Crunch. On May 7, 2010, CKX, Inc. announced Robert F.X. Sillerman had resigned as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company and from the company's board, effective immediately. Still holding 21% of the shares, he began working with One Equity Partners on a $550m-$560m takeover bid. In May, Fuller teamed up with former Barclays Capital executive Roger Jenkins, creating a $1Bn fund. They propose as their first purchase CKX, at a bid level of $600m. On the current share price, CKX is valued at $395m, with $101m of debt and $55m of cash at the end of first quarter 2010. However, in 2010-10-27, CKx, Inc. announced it was no longer discussing a potential sale of the company or of a controlling stake in the company. On May 10, 2011, CKX, Inc. it has entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of Apollo Global Management (\\"Apollo\\").

Thurleigh was transferred to the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force on 9 December 1942 and designated Station 111, and used for heavy bomber operations against Nazi Germany. History Thurleigh (pronounced \\"thur-lie\\") was built for RAF Bomber Command in 1940 by W & C French Ltd. north of the village of Thurleigh on farmland between the farms of Buryfields, Bletsoe Park, Manor, and Whitwickgreen. It was eventually modified to Air Ministry Class A airfield specifications, with three converging runways, extended in 1942 to lengths of 6,000 feet (runway 06-24) and 4,200 feet (runways 18-36 and 12-30). Thurleigh was unique among bomber bases in having four T2 type metal hangars where most bases had only two. RAF Bomber Command use Its first use was by No. 160 Squadron RAF, forming on 16 January 1942 as a ground echelon then deployed to the China-Burma-India Theater at Drigh Road on 4 June 1942. The airfield was also used by No. 18 Operational Training Unit RAF. USAAF use Thurleigh was one of 28 fields listed for use by the U.S. Eighth Air Force on 4 June 1942, tentatively designated station B-4, and was allocated on 10 August 1942. The RAF had found that the initial construction of Thurleigh was inadequate for the combat weight of B-24 bombers. After the departure of the RAF, Thurleigh's runways were lengthened, increased in thickness, and additional hardstands constructed to Class A standards so it could accommodate a USAAF heavy bomber group. From 16 September 1943 though 25 June 1945, Thurleigh served as headquarters for the 40th Combat Bombardment Wing of the 1st Bomb Division. =306th Bombardment Group (Heavy)= With the essential construction completed, the 306th Bombardment Group (Heavy) deployed to Thurleigh on 7 September 1942 from Wendover AAF Utah. The 306th was assigned to the 40th Combat Wing also at Thurleigh. The group tail code was a \\"Triangle H\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 367th Bombardment Squadron (GY) * 368th Bombardment Squadron (BO) * 369th Bombardment Squadron (WW) * 423d Bombardment Squadron (RD) The group flew the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft, and remained at Thurleigh until 1 December 1945. That was the longest tenure of any U.S. air group at a UK base. At Thurleigh, the group operated primarily against strategic targets initially in occupied France and the Low Countries, then later in Germany. The group struck locomotive works at Lille, railway yards at Rouen, submarine pens at Bordeaux, shipbuilding yards at Vegesack, ball-bearing works at Schweinfurt, oil plants at Merseburg, marshalling yards at Stuttgart, a foundry at Hannover, a chemical plant at Ludwigshafen, aircraft factories at Leipzig, and numerous other targets on the Continent. The 306th led the Eighth Air Force on its first mission to bomb a target in Germany on 27 January 1943, attacking U-boat yards at Wilhelmshaven, and suffered severe losses in attacks on Bremen on 16 April 1943, and Schweinfurt, 17 August 1943. On 11 January 1944, without fighter escort and in the face of strong opposition, the 306th was part of a 1st Bombardment Division mission against aircraft factories in central Germany in which all groups were awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation. The 306th Bomb Group received a second DUC during Big Week, the intensive campaign against the German aircraft industry, when it effectively bombed an aircraft assembly plant at Bernberg on 22 February 1944, after poor weather forced other groups to abandon the mission. The 306th Bomb Group flew its 342nd and final mission on 19 April 1945, the most of any Eighth Air Force B-17 unit except the 303rd Bomb Group. It compiled 9,614 sorties; dropped 22,575 tons of bombs; and had 171 B-17's fail to return from missions. =Twelve O'Clock High= Twelve O'Clock High was a 1949 film and book about bomber crews of the United States Army Air Forces who flew the initial daylight bombing missions against Germany during the Second World War. Twelve O'Clock High is frequently cited by surviving bomber crew members as the most accurate depiction by Hollywood of their life during the war. This film is used by both the British Royal Navy and U.S. Navy as an example of leadership styles in their Leadership and Management Training Schools for officers and enlisted personnel. The Air Force's College for Enlisted Professional Military Education also uses this film as an education aid in its Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academies. The protagonist of the story, Brigadier General Frank Savage, group commander of the fictional 918th Bomb Group, was possibly modelled on Colonel Frank A. Armstrong, a group Commander of the 306th BG. The fictional counterparts of Thurleigh and the 306th Bomb Group were \\"Archbury\\" and the \\"918th Bomb Group,\\" the number 918 being derived from 306 multiplied by 3. The opening scenes of the film were however filmed at former RAF Chelveston, a station several miles to the north where the 305th Bomb Group was based. RAE Bedford Starting in 1946, construction work began on the airfield to turn the site into what became known as the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Bedford. The runway was extended in the post-war period to accommodate the Bristol Brabazon aircraft (which required a very long runway) that ultimately never went into production. One local road was dropped into a cutting so that it would not sit above the level of the runway. The airfield was decommissioned in February 1994 after a lengthy study determined that flight operations should be centralised at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire. Due to the cost and impracticality of relocating the Advanced Flight Simulator system the site retains some of its development work (under the banner of QinetiQ from mid-2001 onwards). As of early 2007, QinetiQ have sold their remaining stake in the Bedford Airfield site (as well as the nearby 'Wind Tunnel' site) and are planning to relocate the remaining staff to Farnborough in early 2008, finally ending the site's long association with military aviation. The airfield was closed in 1997 with the RAE having become the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). DERA consolidated its experimental flying operations at Boscombe Down, moving aircraft from Farnborough as well as Bedford. Current use With the end of military control, the airfield has been divided into two parts. The southern part is now known as Thurleigh Business Park, and includes the runway, which is currently used for the mass storage of new cars and cars from the British government scrappage scheme, although it remains intact for possible future use. The northern part houses the Bedford Autodrome, as well as Thurleigh Museum which is dedicated primarily to the airfield and life in the area during the Second World War. The eastern end remains in aviation use as Bedford Aerodrome.https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1304765856 Openstreetmap See also * List of former Royal Air Force stations References=CitationsBibliography   * * Ravenstein, Charles A., Air Force Combat Wings Lineage and Honors Histories 1947–1977, Office of Air Force History, 1984 * Rogers, Brian, United States Air Force Unit Designations Since 1978, 2005 External links * 306th Bombardment Wing website * 306th Bomb Group Museum * Historic Thurleigh Photo Gallery * United States Army Air Forces - Thurleigh * USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers--1908 to present Category:Royal Air Force stations in Bedfordshire Category:Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom Category:Airfields of the VIII Bomber Command in Bedfordshire ","title":"RAF Thurleigh"},{"id":"4466194","text":"Lagny is the name or part of the name of three communes of France: *Lagny, Oise in the Oise département *Lagny-le-Sec in the Oise département *Lagny-sur- Marne in the Seine-et-Marne département ","title":"Lagny"},{"id":"4466198","title":"Lisa Dobriskey"},{"id":"4466202","text":"Alchemy Records is the name of three different record labels: * Alchemy Records (U.S.), based in San Francisco * Alchemy Records (Japan), based in Osaka * Alchemy Records (UK), based in London ","title":"Alchemy Records"},{"id":"4466205","text":"The Common Application (informally known as the Common App) is an undergraduate college admission application that applicants may use to apply to any of more than 800 member colleges and universities in 49 states and the District of Columbia, as well as in Canada, China, Japan, and many European countries.The Common Application: Explore Colleges Member colleges and universities that accept the Common App are made up of over 100 public universities, 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and over 250 institutions that do not require an application fee. It is managed by the staff of a not-for-profit membership association (The Common Application, Inc.) and governed by a 13-member volunteer Board of Directors drawn from the ranks of college admission deans and secondary school college counselors. Its mission is to promote access, equity, and integrity in the college admission process, which includes subjective factors gleaned from essays and recommendations alongside more objective criteria such as class rank.  Digital application system  There are different Common Applications for first-year admission and transfer admission. Both versions allow the application to be filled out once online and submitted to all schools of the applicant's choosing, with the same information going to different schools. Once the application is submitted to a college online, it cannot be changed for that college; the student must contact the college directly if they wish to correct an error or provide more information. The Common Application also allows the student to submit and track other components of their application such as supplemental questions, recommendation letters, application fees, and school forms. Students may also roll over their account information within the Common App tab of the dashboard from year to year, using the same user name and password. Although the Common Application allows applicants to self-report standardized test scores (including the SAT and ACT) and international educational qualifications (such as GCE A-levels or the Baccalauréat), the vast majority of colleges require an official score report from a testing agency. Membership Of the Common Application's more than 700 member institutions, about one-third are \\"exclusive users\\" that use the Common Application as their only admissions application online or in print (listed here). If the member has a separate proprietary application, they are required to give equal consideration to applicants using either form as a condition of membership.Common Application Membership Requirements \\"Fair Common Application\\" To protest the inequity of the college application process for undocumented immigrant students, many of whom were brought to the U.S. as very young children, the immigrant rights group Students for Undocumented Dreams and Decision Equity Now (SUDDEN) launched the Fair Common Application website. Visitors to the website are able to sign a petition for the Common App to change its current demographic options to include undocumented American immigrants. The group argued that this, coupled with a failure to mention undocumented immigrants in the Common App's non-discrimination clause, left undocumented applicants unsure if they could use the application service. By petitioning to change this policy, the group hoped to see a clearer application that helps undocumented Americans avoid the \\"separate and unequal\\" admissions process for international students. Common App representatives threatened legal action, alleging copyright infringement, resulting in the website's creators taking the protest site down. Technical difficulties From August to October 2013, the Common App drew criticism due to multiple issues with their website. On August 1, 2013, the Common Application launched its new CA4 system.http://chronicle.com/blogs/headcount/common-application- plans-for-more-growth/28815 Counselors and students reported portions of essays being deleted, formatting issues, instructor recommendation problems, payments being sent out multiple times and more. By December 2013, managers claimed the \\"glitches\\" with the Common App appeared to have been resolved, with one admissions director describing the situation as \\"basically ‘business as usual.’\\" In late October 2017, the Common App was temporarily taken offline due to unusual spikes in system activity. Despite the brief disruption, more than 1 million students submitted via Common App in November 1, 2017. Competition The Universal College Application was started in 2007 and as of March 2019, had 10 participating institutions. The Coalition Application was created by selective consortium of colleges and universities known as the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, in September 2015. Over 150 US-based universities participate. The Coalition application was created as a more \\"holistic\\" application, and includes \\"lockers\\" where students can create a portfolio starting in 9th grade.

Gamlehaugen has a history that goes as far back as the Middle Ages, and the list of previous owners includes many of the wealthiest men in Bergen. Today owned by the Norwegian state, the most recent private owner was Christian Michelsen, a politician and shipping magnate who later became the first Prime Minister of Norway after the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway. Michelsen commissioned the construction of the current main building at Gamlehaugen, where he would live for most of the rest of his life. When Michelsen died in 1925, his closest friends and colleagues started a national fund-raising campaign that brought in enough money to allow the Norwegian state to purchase the property. The large English park was opened to the public the same year, and the ground floor of the house was opened as a museum two years later. Gamlehaugen has been the Norwegian Royal Family's residence in Bergen since 1927. History Gamlehaugen castle in Bergen, Norway Gamlehaugen was the site of a farm as early as the Middle Ages, but it was abandoned as a result of the Black Death. In 1665, it once again became farmland, as part of the larger Fjøsanger manor. In 1809, Gamlehaugen was separated from Fjøsanger. Marie Krohn, the niece of Danckert Danckertsen Krohn, who had owned Fjøsanger until his death in 1795, built a mansion at Gamlehaugen. A Schack Stenberg purchased Gamlehaugen in 1838. In 1864, Alexander Bull, the son of the violinist Ole Bull bought the property, however, he sold it to copper smith Ole Andreas Gundersen only two years later. The last owner who operated Gamlehaugen as a farm was the merchant Anton Mohr, who bought it in 1878. When he died in 1890, his widow, Alethe Mohr, sold the property to a pair of artisans from Bergen. However, she was allowed to continue using the property and the main building due to a clausule in the sale contract. In 1898, Christian Michelsen, a politician and shipping magnate, bought the property. He demolished the existing main building, a Swiss chalet style mansion, and ordered the construction of a new building in the style of a Scottish baronial style castle. The architect was Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland, who would later draw the Bergen Railway Station and the brick buildings at Bryggen. The construction was finished in 1900, and Michelsen with family moved in the next year. He delegated the task of converting the farmlands surrounding the building into a park to gardener Olav Moen, who designed it as an English park. Barring his years as Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907, Christian Michelsen lived at Gamlehaugen for the remainder of his life.  Royal residence  The main building seen from the north- west. Following Michelsen's death in 1925, his closest friends and colleagues initiated a national fund-raising campaign which sought to collect the money needed for the state to purchase Gamlehaugen, as well as create a fund to pay for the costs of operation and maintenance. While the campaign did not raise the goal of one million NOK, the state did nevertheless buy the property. The fund eventually ran dry, and the state has paid for the upkeep since 1965. Gamlehaugen was renovated between 1989 and 1991 in preparation for Harald V and Queen Sonja's first visit as king and queen consort. Crown Prince Haakon resided at the mansion while he attended the Royal Norwegian Naval Academy in the 1990s. thumb Park The park on a quiet day in June. Prior to Christian Michelsen's acquisition of Gamlehaugen, most of the property was used as farmland. Michelsen gave the task of converting it into a large park to gardener Olav Moen, who later became a professor at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Moen wanted a park dominated by evergreen plants and trees, however Michelsen's wish for a fruit garden won out in the end. The park was designed as an English garden, adhering to the natural lines and curves of the landscape. The avenue which today leads from the main road to the mansion is a baroque element, unfamiliar to the garden as a whole. The park has been open to the public since the state acquired it in 1925. The fruit trees and bushes which were planted when the park was first laid out all died soon after, but the park still contains many of the original trees, several of which are from before Christian Michelsen acquired Gamlehaugen. The park is still a popular recreation ground, especially due to its location next to Nordåsvannet, which allows for bathing and other water activities. Other buildings The stable The stable is a red building located next to the road. It was originally located near the caretaker's house, which had to be demolished in 1986 when the rock it was built on was blasted away to make room for the widening of the main road. Directly west of the stable is an unused root cellar. Further west, on the other side of the main building, is a greenhouse, currently used by the janitorial crew. While the greenhouse is relatively small, a larger greenhouse is known to have existed at some point during the time Michelsen was the owner of Gamlehaugen. Finally, a boathouse, built c. 1900, can be found by the waterside in the far north of the property. The property originally contained several additional buildings; the most recent ones to be demolished, apart from the caretaker's house, are a gardener's house, demolished in 1972, and a bath house, demolished in the 1950s, both of which stood by the waterside.

Into the Past: The Cinema of Guy Maddin. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010. Print. and shot over 24 days. The film was Maddin's first collaboration with Isabella Rossellini, who subsequently appeared in a number of Maddin's films, and co-created a film with him about her father Roberto Rossellini. Maddin and co-screenwriter George Toles based the film on an original screenplay written by Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, from which they kept \\"the title, the premise and the contest – to determine which country’s music was the saddest\\" but otherwise re-wrote. Like most of Guy Maddin's films, The Saddest Music in the World is filmed in a style that imitates late 1920s and early 1930s cinema, with grainy black-and-white photography, slightly out-of-sync sound and expressionist art design. A few scenes are filmed in colour, in a manner that imitates early two-strip Technicolor. Plot During the Great Depression in 1933 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, baroness Helen Port-Huntley (Isabella Rossellini) announces a competition to find the saddest music in the world, as a publicity stunt to promote her company, Muskeg Beer, as Prohibition is about to end in the United States. The prize is $25,000 \\"Depression-era dollars\\" and musicians from all over the world pour into Winnipeg to compete. Chester Kent (Mark McKinney), a failing Broadway producer, decides to enter the contest representing America, even though he is Canadian and originally from Winnipeg. An old fortune teller predicts his doom, but Chester mocks this prediction by having his nymphomaniac amnesiac girlfriend Narcissa (Maria de Medeiros) masturbate him. Also entering the contest are Chester's father Fyodor (David Fox), representing Canada, and his brother Roderick (Ross McMillan), representing Serbia as \\"Gavrilo the Great\\" (even though he is also Canadian). It is revealed that Fyodor is in love with Helen, who he had once hoped to marry. However, Helen and Chester had an affair, and an accident involving the three occurred when Fyodor stepped out in front of Chester's car as Helen was performing oral sex on Chester. Helen's legs were both amputated as a result, and Fyodor became an alcoholic, while Chester left for Broadway. With Chester returned, and his relationship with Helen renewed, Fyodor swears off drink and fashions prosthetic legs filled with beer in an attempt to earn Helen's love. Roderick meanwhile discovers that Chester's girlfriend Narcissa is his missing wife, who has forgotten both their marriage and their son after the boy's death (Roderick carries the boy's heart in a jar, preserved in his own tears). Helen rigs the contest to favour Chester/America, and Fyodor/Canada quickly loses after singing \\"Red Maples Leaves,\\" although Roderick/Serbia advances. Although Roderick and Narcissa have sex, she still doesn't remember their marriage, and he accidentally breaks the jar containing his son's heart (which is pierced by a glass shard), and although Helen loves her new glass beer legs, she still hates Fyodor. Fyodor then drinks a leg's worth of beer and falls through the concert hall rooftop to his death. Helen appears in Chester's final performance, but her legs leak and explode when Roderick plays. Roderick then changes his tune to play \\"The Song Is You,\\" which he had sworn not to perform until reunited with his wife. The song recovers Narcissa's memory and Chester, meanwhile, is stabbed to death by Helen (using a long shard from her glass legs). Chester refuses to let this sadden him, and staggers away, accidentally setting the building on fire with his victory cigar. Chester dies playing \\"The Song Is You\\" on the piano as the building burns.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 79% based on 103 reviews, and an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Guy Maddin perfectly recreates the look and feel of a 1930s in this bizarre picture.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The Christian Science Monitor drew attention to \\"Maddin's unique style ... [which] carries old-movie nostalgia past the breaking point, making the picture look and sound like a long-ago production that's been stored under somebody's bed for the past few decades, and now reaches the screen replete with often- spliced frames and a fuzz-filled sound track. This is no mere gimmick but a core ingredient of Maddin's aesthetic, which bestows affection and regard on everything we overlook and undervalue in our daily lives.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars, calling it \\"entirely original\\" and noting that \\"You have never seen a film like this before, unless you have seen other films by Guy Maddin.\\"  References External links  Maddin's production diary for The Saddest Music in the World Category:2003 films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian musical comedy films Category:Films directed by Guy Maddin Category:Films with screenplays by Kazuo Ishiguro Category:2000s musical comedy films Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films shot in Winnipeg Category:Films set in Winnipeg Category:2003 comedy films ","title":"The Saddest Music in the World"},{"id":"4466229","text":"Mory is the name or part of the name of three communes of France: *Mory, Pas- de-Calais in the Pas-de-Calais département *Mory-Montcrux in the Oise département *Mitry-Mory in the Seine-et-Marne département Mory is also the name of two locations in Poland: *Mory, Pułtusk County in Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) *Mory, Warsaw West County in Masovian Voivodeship (east- central Poland) See also *Morey (disambiguation) *Maury (disambiguation) *Morley (disambiguation) ","title":"Mory"},{"id":"4466230","title":"Burkina Faso at the 1996 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"4466237","text":"SAS Group destinations This is a complete list of the SAS Group airlines destinations, including Air Greenland, Scandinavian Airlines and Widerøe.

It is also included on their 2002 compilation album, The Best of 1990–2000, in a reworked version. A highlight of the PopMart Tour, it was often dedicated to Michael Hutchence during the final few months of the PopMart Tour and during the following Elevation Tour. Lead vocalist Bono frequently refers to it as one of his favorite songs of the band's. Guitarist the Edge has also stated he was very pleased with the \\"New Mix\\" of the song available on The Best of 1990–2000. \\"Gone\\", along with several other tracks from Pop and the band's previous album Zooropa, were remixed and either dubbed \\"The New Mix\\" or \\"Mike Hedges Mix\\" to help fit in with the more instrumentally-conservative songs of All That You Can't Leave Behind. Some reviews of the Best of compilation, notably Allmusic's review singled out the remixes of Pop songs, calling \\"none improvements and all undermining the actual career arc of U2 in the '90s.\\" \\"Gone\\" was initially considered as a single. The video for the song that was included on the DVD bundled with The Best of 1990–2000 was taken from the concert film PopMart: Live from Mexico City. Live \\"Gone\\" was played at all PopMart Tour concerts and was also one of a few Pop songs that showed up during the band's following Elevation Tour. During PopMart it was regularly played in the first 5 songs, normally 3rd after \\"I Will Follow\\", while it was performed after \\"Kite\\" during the Elevation Tour. In PopMart shows, Bono would say \\"Hutch, going, going, but not gone.\\" and in Elevation Tour shows, Bono would yell \\"Hutch!\\" in dedication to Hutchence. \\"Gone\\" is also performed on the Elevation 2001: Live from Boston live video release, most notably as showing the Edge smashing his guitar at the end of the song out of frustration. The Edge used a Rickenbacker 330-12 when performing this song live, and is accompanied by Bono using a Gretsch guitar. In live performances, the Edge would sing backing vocals \\"down\\" during Bono's \\"I'm not coming down\\" verses.

Life Hatef Esfahani was born in Isfahan (Esfahan), a central province of Iran, and most likely he died there in 1783. (Some documents also indicate that he died in 1777). Hatef's date of birth is unknown. He was contemporary to at least seven rulers of Iran, namely Shah Rukh of Persia (ruled 1748–1796), Karim Khan Zand (r. 1760–1779), Abolfath Khan, Mohammad Ali Khan, Sadiq Khan Zand, and Ali Murad Khan (all from Zand dynasty who ruled 1779–1785), and Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of Qajar dynasty (r. 1781–1797). He studied mathematics, medicine, philosophy, literature, and foreign languages (Turkish and Arabic). He had a son and a daughter. His daughter, named Beygom, married poet Mirza Ali Akbar Naziri. Poems Hatef was an expert in the composition of ghazals (odes). A ghazal is a poem of complex structure and exalted by lyrical or rhapsodic mood on some stated theme. Another line of his profession was in the writing of tarji'-band poems. When the linking verse is recurrent, the poem is called a tarji'-band (literally: return-tie). But when the linking verse is varied, the poem is called a tarkib-band (literally: Composite-Tie). He was also skilful in the composition of qasidas, elegies (sugnameh), rubaiyat (quatrains) and fragments (qita'at). But his reputation lay in his excellent poems of a mystical nature. Hatef has been considered as one of the great Iranian mystic poets who taught many peoples about the higher aspects of the human existence and the journey of the soul. Hatef's poems are smooth, clear and flowing and free of ambiguities. He followed Saadi and Hafez especially in the composition of his odes. Due to his excellent odes, Hatef is also very well known in many parts of Europe and particularly in Italy. He wrote a tarji'-band which has made him famous. It is perhaps one of the best single poems in Persian Mystic poetry. Hatef went to a fire temple, to a church, and to a pub, and everywhere he found that people worshipped the same One God. In this poem, the part that deals with Christianity is an attempt to explain the mystery of the Trinity. The description of a discourse with a beautiful girl in a church perhaps reveals the Armenian influence in Iran from the time of Shah Abbas of Safavid dynasty onwards. (Shah Abbas ruled Iran from 1588 to 1629). Click to view the Persian and the English versions of that part of the poem. Hatef also wrote three odes in Arabic. In two of his odes, he was inspired by the poems attributed to Urvah ibn Hazam Ozri, Jamil ibn Ozri and Umar ibn Abirabia. In the third ode, which is a eulogy of the Prophet, he was inspired by the poems composed by Fallera and Bursiri. Hatef's Poetry Anthology (in Persian: Divan- e-Hatef-e-Esfahani) was firstly edited and published in Tehran in 1953 by late poet and scholar Hassan Vahid Dastgerdi (Dastjerdi), the founder of the literary journal Gift (in Persian: Armaghan).

It was shot in Morocco and Malta. It stars Jeremy Sisto as the titular character, Jacqueline Bisset as Mary of Nazareth, Debra Messing as Mary Magdalene and Gary Oldman as Pontius Pilate. The miniseries was broadcast in Italy in two parts on December 5 and 6, 1999https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/italians-flock-to-jesus- mini-1117760324/ before being broadcast in the United States on May 14 and 15, 2000. Overview The film's chronology entails a cinematic blending of the Four Gospels with the addition of extra-biblical elements not found in the New Testament accounts. It provides a down to earth approach through its focus on the human aspect of Jesus. Compared to more solemn and divine portrayals in earlier films, Jesus expresses emotions weeping at Joseph's funeral, throwing stones in Lake Galilee upon meeting Simon Peter and James son of Zebedee, dancing at the wedding at Cana, and starting a water-splashing fight with his disciples. While the film mainly presented familiar Christian Episodes, it provides extra-biblical scenes such as flashbacks of his first trip to Jerusalem with John as well as scenes of war and destruction waged in the name of Jesus during the medieval and modern times. Likewise, the film's Satan comes in two different forms: a visual exemplification of a modern man and a woman in red, instead of the traditional snake that can be found in most films. The film also adds a composite character, an apocryphal Roman historian named \\"Livio\\" who watches and comments as events unfold; he is presumably named after Livy. The film has been generally well received but it also been criticized for having an unrealistic Crucifixion scene as the person nailing Jesus to the cross is not a Roman Soldier but a Jew from the crowd. It has also been criticized for having a highly unsympathetic portrayal of Pontius Pilate, who appears to deliberately do everything to annoy the Jews, which is unlike most other media works in which he is usually depicted as an unwilling gentile participant dragged by the Sanhedrin into the unjust proceedings. As it appears in the credits, it was dedicated in memory of Enrico Sabbatini.

Guatemalan Party of Labour – Communist Party (in Spanish: Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo – Partido Comunista) was an underground communist party in Guatemala. PGT-PC was formed in 1978 as a split from the Guatemalan Party of Labour (PGT). The founders of PGT-PC belonged to two groupings within PGT. One section which participated in forming PGT-PC had only a brief period of membership in PGT. They had belonged to the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR), but had left FAR to join PGT. The other section was made up by members of the Military Commission of PGT (i.e. the armed branch of the party) in the Central Regional Committee and the Alamos Zonal Committee. In the early 1980s PGT-PC expelled Carlos Quinteros (nom de guerre: Miguel). Quinteros had joined PGT-PC after having participated in the formation of the National Directing Nucleus of PGT (PGT-NDN). Quinteros was captured by state forces on October 9, 1983. Quinteros become a collaborator of the government armed forces. He provided information to the military about the whereabouts and identities of leaders and key cadres of PGT, PGT-NDN and PGT-PC. The arrests and killings that followed wiped out PGT-PC. Only a small section of the party remained active, regrouping itself as the Guatemalan Party of Labour – Alamos.

The first remains of Talarurus were discovered in 1948 and later described by the Russian paleontologist Evgeny Maleev with the type species T. plicatospineus. It is known from multiple yet sparse specimens, making it one of the most well known ankylosaurines, along with Pinacosaurus. Elements from the specimens consists of some bones from the body, however, five skulls have been discovered and assigned to the genus, although the first two were very fragmented. It was a medium-sized, heavily built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore, that could grow up to long and weighed about , nearly a ton. Like other ankylosaurs it had heavy armour and a club on its tail, making much of its mobility slow. Talarurus is classified as a member of the Ankylosauria, in the Ankylosaurinae, a group of derived ankyosaurs. Talarurus is known from the Bayan Shireh Formation, being likely niche partitioned with Tsagantegia, as indicated by its muzzle, which has a rectangular shape specialized for grazing. These represent the oldest known ankylosaurines from Asia, although they are not very closely related to each other. It appears that the closest relative of Talarurus was Nodocephalosaurus, an ankylosaurin with similar facial osteoderms. Most of the skeletal mounts of Talarurus are outdated by numerous issues, such as the ribs pointing to the bottom instead of stick to the sides, as in most ankylosaurs; an inaccurate skull cast which is mainly based on related species and not on the available skull material; very displayed arms and legs; four digits on the feet, which in reality only had three as indicated by related ankylosaurines. All of these mistakes were made by anatomical misunderstandings since ankylosaurs were not fully known at that time, also, Talarurus is not known from a complete skeleton. History of discovery Fossil localities in Mongolia. Talarurus is mainly known from Baynshire and Bayshin Tsav localities. Talarurus remains have been discovered in the southeastern parts of the Gobi Desert in what is now Mongolia. The holotype specimen PIN 557-91 was discovered in 1948 by the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition, and unearthed from sandy, red calcareous claystone at the Baynshire locality of the Bayan Shireh Formation. Talarurus was described and named by the Russian paleontologist Evgeny Maleev in 1952. Specimen PIN 557, the original holotype designated by Maleev, included a fragmentary skull with the posterior part of the skull roof, including the occipital region and the basicranium, numerous vertebrae, several ribs, a scapulocoracoid, a humerus, a radius, an ulna, a nearly complete manus, a partial ilium, an ischium, a femur, a tibia, a fibula, a nearly complete pes, and assorted armor and scutes. The generic name, Talarurus, is derived from the Greek τάλαρος (\\"tálaros\\", meaning basket or wicker cage) and οὐρά (\\"ourā́\\", meaning rear or tail), in a reference to the club end of the tail which bears resemblance to a wicker basket, and the length of the tail which consists of interlaced bony struts, reminiscent of the weave that is employed when making wicker baskets. The specific name, \\"plicatospineus\\", is derived from the Latin plicātus (meaning folded) and spīneus (meaning thorny or spiny), in a reference to the numerous osteoderms that gave form to its armor in life. In fact it consisted of fragmentary remains of six individuals discovered at the site. In 1977, Teresa Maryańska chose PIN 557-91, a posterior rear of the skull, as the holotype, given the irregularities of the combined individuals. Also, she renamed Syrmosaurus disparoserratus into a second species: Talarurus disparoserratus. However, in 1987, this was remade into the separate genus Maleevus. Elements of all these specimens were combined into a skeletal mount exhibited at the Orlov Museum. Although very complete, in several aspects the mount is strongly innacurate. The type and only valid species known today is Talarurus plicatospineus. MUSE - Science Museum in Trento, featuring unusual traits. Talarurus is now known from at least a dozen individual specimens from various localities. Specimen PIN 3780/1 was collected from terrestrial sediments at the Bayshin-Tsav locality of the Bayan Shireh Formation, by a joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition in 1975 and is now reposited at the Paleontological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, in Moscow. This material was assigned to Talarurus and is also considered to date from the Turonian stage of the Cretaceous. This specimen consists of the top of a skull and a fragmentary skeleton. Since 2006, in the context of the Korea-Mongolia Joint International Dinosaur Project, numerous additional specimens have been referred to Talarurus, found at the Baynshire and Shine Us Khuduk localities. These in 2014 were still undescribed. Another specimen referred to this genus from the Bayshin Tsav locality is composed of an (undescribed) incomplete skull with cranial roof, occipital part and braincase. A second undescribed specimen, collected at the Baga Tarjach locality, consists of a fragment of a maxilla with eight teeth. Arbour have listed many of the referred and additional material for Talarurus. Even more additional material has been found. In 2007 during the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur Expedition, specimens MPC-D 100/1354, MPC-D 100/1355, and MPC-D 100/1356 were collected from the eastern part of the Gobi Desert, at the Bayn Shire locality in the Bayan Shireh Formation. These specimens were described on detail in 2019, consisting of three medium-preserved skulls with additional anatomical and ecological data for Talarurus. This new material is now permanently housed at the Institute of Paleontology and Geology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. Description Initially, Maleev described Talarurus as having four digits on the foot. However, the foot was not found in articulation; the mounted foot is a composite, and three is the more likely number as all other known ankylosaurids show three toes; earlier reports that Pinacosaurus also possessed four are incorrect. Another presumed characteristics: the osteoderms had a furrowed ornamentation, making a specially formidable armor, with each plate adorned with additional pleated spines. These were also based on a misunderstanding. These were segments of the halfrings protecting the neck, with their typical low keels. The mount has the further peculiarity that it shows Talarurus as built like a hippopotamus, with a barrel-shaped thorax, not with the characteristic ankylosaurid low and wide body type, and the forelimbs are strongly splayed. This was caused by an incorrect positioning of the ribs as if they were appending instead of sticking out sideways; this mistake also prevented a mounting of the wide upper pelvic elements. Size and distinguishing traits Size compared to a 1.8 m tall human. Talarurus was a medium sized ankylosaur, Thomas Holtz and Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at , Paul gave a weight of , however, Holtz estimated it around . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Like other ankylosaurids, it had a wide rostrum (beak), a formidable osteoderms running across its body, forming an extensive armor, and the famous tail club. Its limbs were robust and short, supporting a wide and rounded belly. Diagnoses provided by Maleev 1956 and Tumanova 1987, were of limited utility as they largely listed traits shared with many other ankylosaurids. Arbour also noted that the foot in fact had three toes. She established a single autapomorphy: on the frontals, at the middle skull roof, a raised V- shaped region is present. Also she determined that Talarurus differed from all known ankylosaurids with the exception of the American Nodocephalosaurus in the possession of caputegulae on the frontals and nasals, that are cone-shaped with a circular base. However, according to Parks et al. 2019, Talarurus can be distinguished based on diverse rostral characteristics, such as the prominent internarial caputegulum, elongated caputegulum, the numerous caputegulae surrounding the nasal area, conical/polygonal-shaped caputegulae, among others. Skull Diagram featuring the most complete skulls: A) MPC-D 100/1354, B) MPC-D 100/1355 and C) MPC-D 100/1356. The skull of Talarurus measured about in total length. The holotype, PIN 557-91, is based only on a posterior skull roof, which features tubercle-like caputegulae (facial osteoderms or armor tiles) that resemble those of Nodocephalosaurus. As noted by Arbour and Currie, the skull roof of PIN 3780/1 appears to have slightly different caputegulae (head osteoderms or armour tiles), and that it was unclear if this represents a taxonomic issue. Nevertheless, all the referred skulls share the same patterns of caputegulae (although little variation among individuals is observable) and therefore referable to the genus. The most complete skull is MPC-D 100/1354. It nicely preserves the maxillary rostrum, which is broad and semi-rectangular in shape and fused, no teeth are found in this zone; probably useful on flat surfaces. As expected, the caputegulae are poligon to tubercle-shaped, with some being present on the nasal area. Each maxilla preserves 23 alveoli, however, the teeth were not preserved. Most of the caputegulae present in the top of the head are hexagonal in shape, in the holotype PIN 557-91 some are triangular. The orbitals are strongly armored with some osteoderms behind them. In MPC-D 100/1355 and MPC-D 100/1356 the squamosal and quadratojugal horns are thick and triangular, with the squamosals being more rounded. Usually, the lower jaw remains of Talarurus do not preserve, however, MPC-D 100/1355 was found in association with a right dentary, very fragmented though. Postcranial skeleton Life restoration Most of the postcranial remains are known from fragmentary individuals. Based on the PIN 557 specimens, the ribs are strongly curved and thickened, having a length ranging between . The vertebral area is partially missing, preserving some cervicals, dorsals, caudals and the sacrum. The cervical vertebrae are amphicoelous (concave on both sides) with thickened centra (body), the neural arches are slightly higher. The dorsals have high, wide centra, and they are also amphicoelous with very elongated and robustly built neural arches; some are broken. More complete than the previous sections, the sacrum consists of 4 presacrals, 4 sacrals, and the first caudal vertebra, these vertebrae are fused together, with some ribs attached. Their size gradually increases from backward to forwards. Some isolated caudal vertebrae are present, they seem to indicate that the tail consisted of approximately 25 to 30 caudals. The anteriormost caudals have somewhat elongated neural arches and centra, the chevrons are fused and triangle- shaped. In contrast, the posteriormost caudals have very flattened chevrons and neural arches. Due to the partial preservation of the specimens, the exact osteoderm arrangement is unknown, however, some have been unearthed. The preserved osteoderms are very sparse, consisting of some cervical halfrings and spine-shaped body osteoderms. The osteoderms are strongly robust, most spine-shaped osteoderms measured in height. MPC-D 100/1355 was found in association with a partial halfring, as well as other body elements. Only the left manus is preserved, it is virtually complete preserving five digits, only lacking some unguals and phalanges. The preserved left pes is very unique; it was described as having four digits, this statement however, was proved to be a product of the initial skeleton mount and three digits is more accurate/likely, as seen in related ankylosaurines. In general terms, both manus and pes metatarsals are strongly robust and stocky. The shoulder girdle is represented by a scapulocoracoid that measures about long, humerus, radius and ulna, these elements are very robust compared to other postcrania and they pertain to the left arm. The left scapulocoracoid is very robust with a well developed insertion for the humerus (glenoid), although the scapular blade is somewhat shortened in length. The humerus is very wide at the ends and thickened measuring long; it shows some resemblance to that of Ankylosaurus. Although fragmentary, the pelvic girdle is represented by a partial and flattened illium with the ischium. Hindlimb elements include the right femur and left tibia. The preserved femur is straight and strongly robust, the greater trochanter is fused with the lesser trochanter; it measures long. The tibia however, is more shortened but greatly wide, it has a total length of . In addition, a fibula was also preserved, it has a length of . Overall, the fibula is more straight and thin compared to the femur and tibia, its distal end is more wide than the proximal end. Classification Ankylosaurid phylogenetic relations are hard to determine because many taxa are only partially known, the exact armour configuration has rarely been preserved, fused osteoderms obscure many details of the skull and the Ankylosauridae are conservative in their postcranial skeleton, showing little variation in their vertebrae, pelves and limbs. Previously it was assumed that as one of the oldest known ankylosaurids, Talarurus possessed some basal characters that are shared with nodosaurids but were later lost in more advanced ankylosaurs, such as the presence of four toes. However, the presumed \\"primitive\\" traits proved to be largely artefacts of the initial skeletal restoration. Recent phylogenetic analysis provides evidence for an assignment of Talarurus to the Ankylosaurinae, a derived ankylosaurid group. This can be reconciled with its relatively old geological age by the possibility that the Ankylosauridae as a whole appeared much earlier during the Early Jurassic, which must have been true if they were the sister group of the Nodosauridae in the sense proposed by Coombs in 1978; i.e. if all polacanthines were nodosaurids. Talarurus was assigned to the Syrmosauridae (now known as Ankylosauridae) by Maleev in its original description in 1952. Walter Preston Coombs suggested that it was the same dinosaur as Euoplocephalus although subsequent study did not support this assertion. Maryańska demonstrated that it differed from Euoplocephalus, citing the shape of the skull, the morphology of the palate, and the presence of four pedal digits. Vickaryous et al. 2004 note the presence of two distinct ankylosaurid clades during the Late Cretaceous, one consisting of North American taxa and the other restricted to Asian taxa. However, Arbour in 2014 recovered trees in which Talarurus was more closely related to North-American forms than to Asian ankylosaurids. In some of these Talarurus was the sister species of Nodocephalosaurus. Comparison between the skull of Euoplocephalus and other North American ankylosaur taxa. Note the presence of Nodocephalosaurus, the closest relative of Talarurus. Paleobiology The 2007 specimen skulls have brought new insights into the neurocranial capacities and dietary habits of Talarurus, specifically the specimen MPC-D 100/1354, which is a well-preserved, almost complete cranium. MPC-D 100/1354 was described in extensive detail along with a very complete skull of Tarchia by Paulina-Carabajal et al. 2017, they noted that ankylosaurids had well- developed gaze stabilization and auditive senses, differing from nodosaurids, by examining the endocranial region of the selected specimens. The presence of the flocculus was first reported in Talarurus by Maryańska and later in other related ankylosaurids, however, this lobe seems to be absent or reduced in nodosaurids. The flocculus is relatively large on most ankylosaurids. Another neuroanatomical character is the elongated lagena, which is prominent in Euoplocephalus, Tarchia and Talarurus. This anatomical feature indicates that ankylosaurids had a large range of sound perception, specially for low frequencies. In addition to these findings, the preserved rostrum in MPC-D 100/1354 is broad, almost rectangular in shape and somewhat stocky. The wide rostrum of Talarurus probably worked with efficience on low vegetation at flat terrain. Evidence seems to indicate that Talarurus had a grazer feeding- method. Paleoenvironment Life restoration of a Talarurus being preyed by an Achillobator pack. The fossil remains of Talarurus have been found in the sediments of Bayan Shireh Formation, which are thought to date from the Cenomanian to Santonian stages of the Late Cretaceous period, about 96 million to 89 million years ago. According to Park et al. 2019, Talarurus filled the niche of a grazer herbivore, whereas Tsagantegia, another ankylosaurid from the formation, filled the niche of a browser herbivore. For instance, Talarurus had a broad and rectangular snout (or beak), useful for low vegetation, while the one in Tsagantegia is more elongated and shovel-shaped, useful for high vegetation. In order to illustrate this differentiation strategy, they compared the ankylosaurids to the extant African white and black rhinoceros: the white rhinoceros is equipped with a broad and rectangular snout, specialized for grazing. The black rhinoceros in the other hand, has a pointed snout for browsing. With these anatomical features and example, it is clear that these taxa were niche partitioned. Another case of niche partitioning can be observed on the therizinosaurids Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus, taxa that were also discovered in the formation. Talarurus compared to the Dinosauria from the Bayan Shireh Formation (Talarurus in light red, sixth from right). Found in Late Cretaceous localities such as Baynshire and Bayshin Tsav, taxa that were contemporaneous with Talarurus in the Upper Bayan Shireh included a diverse dinosaur fauna, such as the large dromaeosaurid Achillobator, the therizinosaurids Erlikosaurus and Segnosaurus, the ornithomimosaur Garudimimus, the small and likely immature ceratopsid Graciliceratops, the small hadrosauroid Gobihadros, and its ecological counterpart, Tsagantegia. Based on the caliche, fluvial and lacustrine sedimentation, the Bayan Shireh Formation was a large semiarid terrain with meanders and lakes, along with the strong presence of angiosperm and gymnosperm plants all over the zone. According to some biostratigraphic occurrences within Asiatic formations, there was a likely correlation between the Iren Dabasu Formation and the Bayan Shireh Formation.

Early life Nawab Malik Amir Mohammad Khan received his college education at Aitchison College, Lahore and then went on to finish his education at Oxford University in England.

His role during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965 is praised as he kept the law and order, controlled the prices, trafficking of the raw material and prevented the smuggling. Among the guests on his famous Kalabagh guest house, The Bohr Bangulow, over the years, were Eleanor Roosevelt in 1952, former Presidents of Pakistan, Iskander Mirza, Ayub Khan and then foreign minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. After a distinguished military career, Khan served as Governor of Sindh during 1984–87 time period under General Zia Ul-Haq regime. Earlier in 1965–66, he was Military Secretary to the then Governor of West Pakistan, Nawab Malik Amir Mohammad Khan. He wrote a book, Pakistan Leadership Challenges, in which Nawab Malik Amir Mohammad Khan comes across as a sound, no-nonsense administrator, firmly wedded to the values and traditions of the feudal class. He was also condidered \\"brutal\\", \\"ruthless\\" and \\"harsh\\" in both his public and private life. British assessment of the Nawab of Kalabagh was very similar. In his book, Jahandad,Nawab Malik Amir Mohammad Khan's Military Secretary dismisses alleged rumours about a somewhat sinister aspect of the Ayub regime. In 1963, the regime faced strong opposition from the political party Jamaat-i-Islami. Ayub himself \\"felt gravely threatened by its head, Maudoodi\\". \\"Some sycophants\\" sought to persuade Ayub that \\"the physical elimination\\" of Maulana would bring peace to the country and that Malik Amir Mohammad Khan was to help execute this attempt. Jahandad Khan dismisses this as a baseless rumour in his above book. Death  It was widely reported in the Pakistani news media that his third youngest son Asadullah Khan killed him over a family property dispute on 26 November 1967. Descendants His eldest son Nawab Malik Muzaffar Khan won the National Assembly seat from NW-44, Mianwali-I in the December 1970 elections Nawab Malik Muzzafar Khan had three sons namely the eldest Malik Idrees Khan, the second Malik Fareed khan and the youngest Malik Waheed Khan.Nawab Malik Idrees Khan became the Nawab of Kalabagh after his father Nawab Malik Muzzafar khan's death.He died without issue.After his death His second Brother Nawab Malik Fareed Khan became Nawab.Nawab Malik Fareed Khan died in a vehicle accident.Thus His only son Nawab Malik Mohammad Ali Khan became Nawab of Kalabagh,A position he holds to this day.Nawab Malik Amir Muhammad Khan's second son Malik Allah Yar also remained the member of Majlis- e-Shoora during General Zia-ul-Haq's military regime.

New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2004. Page 192. is an anglerfish of the family Linophrynidae, found in all tropical and subtropical oceans at depths below 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in the Bathyal zone. Its length is up to 77 mm (3 inches). The female is significantly larger than the mature, parasitic male. Characteristics The literal translation is Linophryne arborifera, which is Greek for “tree-bearing flax-toad.” The female Linophryne has not only a luminous lure on the head, called the esca (Latin for “food”), but also a multibranched barbel hanging from the lower jaw. The barbel filaments contain many more bioluminescent organs. At a length of up to 77 mm (3 inches), females are significantly larger than the males, which reach only about 15 mm (0.6 inches).Pietsch, TW, Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes), Ichthyol Res (2005) 52: 207–236 After metamorphosis they are black in color. They have no scales and gelatinous skin. They are different from all other ceratioid families in having dorsal-fin rays 3 (rarely 4), anal-fin rays 3 (rarely 2 or 4), branchiostegal rays 5 (rarely 4), and a sinistral (opens to the left) anus. The eyes of linophrynid males are very well developed and unique among ceratioids in being tubular and directed somewhat forward. The nostrils of linophrynid males are also large and well developed. Distribution L. arborifera is found in all tropical and subtropical oceans at depths below 1,000 m (3,300 ft). Feeding  Recorded prey of the genus Linophryne include fishes and crustaceans. Attached males obtain their nutrition from the female. They attach to the female with their jaws on her ventral surface. Blood vessels and tissues between them become integrated, allowing nutrients to pass from the female to the male.Anderson, ME, Leslie RW, Review of the deep-sea anglerfishes (lophiiformes: ceratioidei) of southern Africa. Ichthyological Bulletin 70-:1-32, 2001. read online Based on finding empty stomachs in captured free-living males, scientists think linophrynid males are unable to feed during their free-living stage after metamorphosis. Also, the “short and stout” denticulars of the upper and lower jaws of these males do not seem suitable for prey capture, and the alimentary canal is undeveloped.Pietsch, TW, Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes), Ichthyol Res (2005) 52: 207–236 Current understanding is that free-living males die after a few months if they do not attach to a female. Growth and reproduction In the family Linophrynidae, males are obligatory sexual parasites.Munk, O, Bertelsen, E, Histology of the attachment between the parasitic male and the female in the deep-sea anglerfish Haplophryne mollis (Brauer, 1902) (Pisces, Ceratioidei). Vidensk. Meddr. Dansk Naturh. Foren., 144: 49-74, 1983 Attached males are nearly always found upside down, facing forward, and attached to the belly close to the anus. In all specimens found so far, only one male is attached to each female, which differs from some other angler fish species. Females without attached males and free-living males do not have well-developed sexual organs, so it seems that they must be attached for maturation and reproduction to occur. A 77-mm female Linophryne arborifera, with a 15-mm parasitic male, was observed to have numerous eggs embedded in a gelatinous mass (the so-called “egg raft” or “veil,” a reproductive device characteristic of all lophiiform fishes) protruding from the genital opening; the eggs, 0.6–0.8mm in diameter, are among the largest known for any ceratioid.Pietsch, TW, Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes), Ichthyol Res (2005) 52: 207–236 Bioluminescence Several species of deep-sea fish have luminous organs used to attract prey. Females of the genus Linophryne bear barbels containing luminous organs in addition to an escal light organ attached to the head. In L. arborifera, the top light organ has been likened to a pearl onion and contains luminous bacteria. The barbels, which look like seaweed fronds, do not contain bacteria but complex paracrystalline photogenic granules. The esca is ectodermal in origin whereas the barbel organs may be derived from the mesoderm.Hansen, K., Herring, P.

Considered one of the greatest contributors to Turkish literature and Azerbaijani literature. Bâkî came to be known as Sultânüş-şuarâ (سلطان الشعرا), or \\"Sultan of poets\\". Life Bâkî was born to a poor family in Constantinople, his father being a muezzin at the Fatih Mosque. Originally, his family apprenticed him to a harness-maker, but he would often skip work to attend classes at a nearby medrese, or Islamic school. Because of this, his family eventually allowed him to formally attend school. Bâkî was a good student, and he attended the lectures of many of the famous lecturers of the time. It was during his school years that his interest in and talent for poetry began to take shape, helped largely by the established poet Zâtî (ذاتی) (1471–1548). After completing school, he worked for some time as a teacher, but later, as his poetic fame began to grow, he was granted a number of different positions—generally as a kadı (ﻗﺎضی), or Islamic judge—in the Ottoman bureaucracy. Bâkî died in Istanbul in the year 1600. Bâkî was always very close to the Ottoman palace, particularly during the reign of Süleymân I, with whom he had good relations. During the subsequent reigns of Selim II and Murad III, he remained close to the palace and to state affairs, and received a great deal of attention and interest both from the public and the palace. Works Bâkî lived during the height of the Ottoman Empire, and this affected his poetry greatly. Love, the joy of living, and nature are the primary subjects of his poems. Although almost no Sufi influence is found in his poetry—as it is in many other Ottoman-era poets—his concept of love as revealed in his poetry was not entirely divorced from the Sufi concept thereof. Bâkî wrote a relatively small number of works in his lifetime, as he always stated that he wanted to make works great in quality rather than quantity. One of his most celebrated works is his Mersiye-i Hazret-i Süleymân Hân (مرثیه ﺣﻀﺮت سليمان خان; \\"Elegy for His Excellency Süleymân Khan\\"), among the most famed of elegiac works in Turkish literature.

Arkon encounters him in the \\"Swayin' Saloon\\" where Skull was waiting for him. While drinking, Skull the Slayer revealed to Arkon that he was sent by Morgan le Fay to kill him and both men started to fight. In a failed attempt of killing himself as well as his enemy, Arkon cut the ropes that kept the saloon suspended and they fell into the swamp below. When Arkon regained consciousness after the fall, he found himself trapped in vines and surrounded by the Man-Things.Weirdworld #3 Arkon began to hallucinate about seeing Polemachus upside down, when Skull freed him from the vines by attacking him fiercely. The hallucination ended with the arrival of the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things, a version of Jennifer Kale who is behind the rebellion against Morgan le Fay. After a brief conversation with the two warriors, the Swamp Queen forced them to face their fears in order to survive it and become her allies against le Fay. However, only Skull accepted the offer to become her ally, while Arkon left the Forest of the Man-Things to keep looking for Polemachus.Weirdworld #4 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1975 comics debuts Category:Fictional soldiers Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics titles ","title":"Skull the Slayer"},{"id":"4466328","text":"Alias analysis is a technique in compiler theory, used to determine if a storage location may be accessed in more than one way. Two pointers are said to be aliased if they point to the same location. Alias analysis techniques are usually classified by flow-sensitivity and context-sensitivity. They may determine may-alias or must-alias information. The term alias analysis is often used interchangeably with points-to analysis, a specific case. Alias analysers intend to make and compute useful information for understanding aliasing in programs. Overview In general, alias analysis determines whether or not separate memory references point to the same area of memory. This allows the compiler to determine what variables in the program will be affected by a statement. For example, consider the following section of code that accesses members of structures: p.foo = 1; q.foo = 2; i = p.foo + 3; There are three possible alias cases here: #The variables p and q cannot alias (i.e., they never point to the same memory location). #The variables p and q must alias (i.e., they always point to the same memory location). #It cannot be conclusively determined at compile time if p and q alias or not. If p and q cannot alias, then \`i = p.foo + 3;\` can be changed to \`i = 4\`. If p and q must alias, then \`i = p.foo + 3;\` can be changed to \`i = 5\` because \`p.foo + 3\` = \`q.foo + 3\`. In both cases, we are able to perform optimizations from the alias knowledge (assuming that no other thread updating the same locations can interleave with the current thread, or that the language memory model permits those updates to be not immediately visible to the current thread in absence of explicit synchronization constructs). On the other hand, if it is not known if p and q alias or not, then no optimizations can be performed and the whole of the code must be executed to get the result. Two memory references are said to have a may-alias relation if their aliasing is unknown. Performing alias analysis In alias analysis, we divide the program's memory into alias classes. Alias classes are disjoint sets of locations that cannot alias to one another. For the discussion here, it is assumed that the optimizations done here occur on a low-level intermediate representation of the program. This is to say that the program has been compiled into binary operations, jumps, moves between registers, moves from registers to memory, moves from memory to registers, branches, and function calls/returns. Type-based alias analysis If the language being compiled is type safe, the compiler's type checker is correct, and the language lacks the ability to create pointers referencing local variables, (such as ML, Haskell, or Java) then some useful optimizations can be made. There are many cases where we know that two memory locations must be in different alias classes: #Two variables of different types cannot be in the same alias class since it is a property of strongly typed, memory reference-free (i.e., references to memory locations cannot be changed directly) languages that two variables of different types cannot share the same memory location simultaneously. #Allocations local to the current stack frame cannot be in the same alias class as any previous allocation from another stack frame. This is the case because new memory allocations must be disjoint from all other memory allocations. #Each record field of each record type has its own alias class, in general, because the typing discipline usually only allows for records of the same type to alias. Since all records of a type will be stored in an identical format in memory, a field can only alias to itself. #Similarly, each array of a given type has its own alias class. When performing alias analysis for code, every load and store to memory needs to be labeled with its class. We then have the useful property, given memory locations A_i and B_j with i,j alias classes, that if i=j then A_i may- alias B_j, and if i eq j then the memory locations will not alias. Flow- based alias analysis Analysis based on flow, can be applied to programs in a language with references or type-casting. Flow based analysis can be used in lieu of or to supplement type based analysis. In flow based analysis, new alias classes are created for each memory allocation, and for every global and local variable whose address has been used. References may point to more than one value over time and thus may be in more than one alias class. This means that each memory location has a set of alias classes instead of a single alias class.

The beam may be carried over free space, or propagated through an optical waveguide (optical fibre). Depending on the parameter of a light beam which is manipulated, modulators may be categorized into amplitude modulators, phase modulators, polarization modulators etc. Often the easiest way to obtain modulation of intensity of a light beam, is to modulate the current driving the light source, e.g. a laser diode. This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason light modulators are, e.g. in fiber optic communications, called external light modulators. With laser diodes where narrow linewidth is required, direct modulation is avoided due to a high bandwidth \\"chirping\\" effect when applying and removing the current to the laser. Classification of optical modulators According to the properties of the material that are used to modulate the light beam, modulators are divided into two groups: absorptive modulators and refractive modulators. In absorptive modulators the absorption coefficient of the material is changed, in refractive modulators the refractive index of the material is changed. The absorption coefficient of the material in the modulator can be manipulated by the Franz-Keldysh effect, the Quantum-confined Stark effect, excitonic absorption, changes of Fermi level, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called an electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of an electro-optic effect. Some modulators utilize an acousto-optic effect or magneto-optic effect or take advantage of polarization changes in liquid crystals. The refractive modulators are named by the respective effect: i.e. electrooptic modulators, acousto-optic modulators etc. The effect of a refractive modulator of any of the types mentioned above is to change the phase of a light beam. The phase modulation can be converted into amplitude modulation using an interferometer or directional coupler. Separate case of modulators are spatial light modulators (SLMs). The role of SLM is modification two dimensional distribution of amplitude and/or phase of an optical wave.

It is optimized to allow clinicians to retrieve data for a single patient rather than to identify a population of patients with common characteristics or to facilitate the management of a specific clinical department. Typical data types which are often found within a CDR include: clinical laboratory test results, patient demographics, pharmacy information, radiology reports and images, pathology reports, hospital admission, discharge and transfer dates, ICD-9 codes, discharge summaries, and progress notes. A Clinical Data Repository could be used in the hospital setting to track prescribing trends as well as for the monitoring of infectious diseases. One area CDR's could potentially be used is monitoring the prescribing of antibiotics in hospitals especially as the number of antiobiotic-resistant bacteria is ever increasing. In 1995, a study at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center conducted by the Harvard Medical School used a CDR to monitor vancomycin use and prescribing trends since vancomycin-resistant enterococci is a growing problem. They used the CDR to track the prescribing by linking the individual patient, medication, and the microbiology lab results which were all contained within the CDR. If the microbiology lab result did not support the use of vancomycin, it was suggested to change the medication to something appropriate as under the Center for Disease Control CDC guidelines. The use of CDR's could help monitor infectious diseases in the hospital and the appropriate prescribing based on lab results. The use of Clinical Data Repositories could provide a wealth of knowledge about patients, their medical conditions, and their outcome. The database could serve as a way to study the relationship and potential patterns between disease progression and management. The term \\"Medical Data Mining\\" has been coined for this method of research. Past epidemiological studies may not have had as complete of information as that which is contained in a CDR, which could lead to inconclusive data/results. The use of medical data mining and correlative studies using the CDR could serve as a valuable resource helping the future of healthcare in all facets of medicine. The idea of data mining a CDW was used for screening variables that were associated with diabetes and poor glycemic control. It allowed for novel correlations that may have not been discovered without this method. One potential use of a clinical data repository would be for clinical trials. This would allow for researchers to have all the information from a study in one place as well as let other researchers benefit from the data to further innovation. They would also be advantageous since they are digital and real-time. This would be easier to log data and keep it accurate since it would be digital rather than in paper form. The clinical data repository is not without its weaknesses, however. Since they usually don't integrate with other non-clinical sources, following patient treatment across the care continuum becomes very difficult. In turn, tracking the true cost per case for each patient isn't feasible. IT teams spend most of their time gathering and compiling data instead of interpreting information and finding opportunities for cutting costs and improving patient care.

She was decommissioned in the early 1990s and is now a naval museum in Germany. Design and construction The Oberon class was a direct follow on of the Porpoise-class, with the same dimensions and external design, but updates to equipment and internal fittings, and a higher grade of steel used for fabrication of the pressure hull. As designed for British service, the Oberon- class submarines were in length between perpendiculars and in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . Displacement was 1,610 tons standard, 2,030 tons full load when surfaced, and 2,410 tons full load when submerged. Propulsion machinery consisted of 2 Admiralty Standard Range 16 VTS diesel generators, and two electric motors, each driving a 3-bladed propeller at up to 400 rpm. Top speed was when submerged, and on the surface. Eight diameter torpedo tubes were fitted (six facing forward, two aft), with a total payload of 24 torpedoes. The boats were fitted with Type 186 and Type 187 sonars, and an I-band surface search radar. The standard complement was 68: 6 officers, 62 sailors. Otus was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company on 31 May 1961, and launched on 17 October 1962. Sea trials were undertaken in Scottish waters, mainly Loch Long and Loch Fyne. The boat was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 5 October 1963. Operational history The first commission of Otus included large-scale missile trial exercises in the Atlantic Ocean and visits to the United States and Halifax, Canada. Otus attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the Submarine Flotilla.Official Souvenir Programme, 1977. Silver Jubilee Fleet Review, HMSO In July 1987, a team of British, Commonwealth and international submariners took part in trials in Bjornafjorden, near Bergen, Norway, aboard Otus. They ran a series of progressively deeper escapes, starting at . At , individuals started to drop out. At the end of the trials two submariners reached a depth of . This set a new world record which to date has not been broken. Of the two record breakers, the first (the commander of the Submarine Escape Training Tower at HMS Dolphin) was a regular ascent under control. The second, a petty officer instructor from the Submarine Escape Training Tower suffered an emergency release having given the alarm signal whilst flooding up the chamber. It was considered safer and quicker to escape him rather than depressurise and drain down. Both escapees suffered no lasting effects and returned to normal service. Both received military honours of the British Empire in the following years for this act. Otus was deployed to the Persian Gulf during the 1991 Gulf War under Operation Granby. On her return to Gosport, she was flying a Jolly Roger; the only indication that the submarine had been involved in deploying and recovering Special Air Service and Special Boat Service personnel. Decommissioning and museum Otus was decommissioned in the early 1990s and resided at Pound's scrapyard in Portsmouth for several years. She was later purchased by a German entrepreneur, who moored her in the harbour of the town of Sassnitz on the island of Rügen in Germany to act as a floating naval museum.

Format (until Season 11)  Quiz Kids is played by two teams of three players each. The player in the center position is the team captain and is responsible for giving the team's answer on all non-toss-up questions. In early years the format varied somewhat from year to year. A face-off round of five questions from a single field in which one player from each team would answer questions was at one point used, but later dropped. The number of schools involved each year fluctuated from the original 16 up to about 40, but as schools grew discontent with bad judging and bad questions.  Season 11 (2010–11)  Thirty-two teams competed in the 2010–2011 season with the members of the winning team receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe courtesy of ACIS. In 2011–12 the competition saw 24 teams. The runners- up receive a $1000 scholarship per student provided by Golden Gate Commandry No. 16, Knights Templar and Burlingame Bodies Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. ACIS withdrew as a sponsor for the 2012–13 year. In the 2011–2012 season 24 teams competed in round one after a screening process at non-televised tournaments. Several teams were inadvertently permitted a grandfather clause to play without screening, leading to a few problems. Concerns arose because some of losing teams outperformed low-scoring winning teams by as much as 200 points. As a result, an intermediary round was devised whereby the bottom four teams were dropped outright, and the remaining eight teams who had lost in round one played again, with the four winners advancing to the second round with all 12 original winners (regardless of score) to make a total of 16. Round two featured 16 teams who played in eight single elimination matches. The eight survivors were then staggered in a ladder tournament whereby the lower six teams contended for a shot to take on the number two seed (Harker School). The winner of that match would play the number one seed, Bellarmine Prep for the championship. Bellarmine Prep defeated the Menlo School (#3 seed) to win the 2011–2012 season.  Game play in 2011–2012  The game is divided into four rounds. There are no point penalties for wrong answers at any point in the game. * The game begins with a \\"Three for All round\\" in which the first part is a tossup open to all six players. The first player who buzzes in must answer without consulting his teammates. If the player is incorrect, the opposing team can consult before giving an answer. If a player answers correctly, his team earns 5 points and receives a second, related, collaboration 5 point question. If the team answers that currently also it receives a third, related, collaboration 15 point question. A clean sweep earned the team 25 points. The other team may not steal either bonus. * In the Collaboration round, each team chooses one of three categories containing seven questions. Each correct answer earns 10 points; a team that answers all seven correct receives a 30-point bonus for a total of 100 points. * The main Three for All round features three-part questions exactly like the first round except that the point totals increase to 10, 15, 25 respectively. Correctly answering all three questions earns a team 50 points. * In the final Countdown round, teams have three minutes to answer tossup questions worth 30 points each. As in the Three for All round, if a player misses a tossup question, the opposing team can consult before answering.  History  BAAL President Gaius Stern worked with the show as a writer and consultant from 2001 to 2003. BAAL Vice President Ross Ritterman served as question writer/editor and show consultant Season 6 through Season 9. In Seasons 8, question material was provided by NAQT and in Season 13 by both NAQT and BAAL. In some years (2001–2003, 2004–2008, 2010–2012) the Bay Area Academic League (BAAL) has participated in writing the questions and judging the matches. BAAL has organized San Francisco Area High School Quizbowl events since 1995. BAAL was originally an arm of the University of California-Berkeley Quiz Bowl club, until 2001. The show underwent difficulties from 2008 to 2010, leading many schools to withdraw. A change of leadership in 2010 brought about many reforms. In 2010 the show underwent a major redesign, under new producer Marc Balcer. Balcer introduced the \\"Three for All\\" format and redesigned the set and graphics. In response to many complaints over bad judging, bad questions, and in an effort to improve the integrity of the show, Balcer brought back BAAL president and UC Berkeley classics professor Gaius Stern as editor and judge. In 2013, Jeff Hoppes took over as question writer and judge. Jeff also runs the Northern California Quiz Bowl Alliance.

He is known for his musical contributions to Sesame Street, for co-creating and co-producing the award-winning PBS literacy education television program Between the Lions, and for his humorous articles and books. Biography His father was co-founder of Random House, publisher, editor and TV panelist Bennett Cerf. His mother was journalist and children's book publisher Phyllis Fraser. His father was Jewish and his mother Catholic. Cerf attended the Deerfield Academy and then graduated from Harvard College. He was married to Geneviève Charbin who is a Catholic of French descent. He married Katherine Vaz in July 2015. After his father's death, his mother remarried ex-New York City mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr.  Musical compositions  Since its first season in 1969, Cerf has played a significant role in the creation and production of the Sesame Street television program, most notably as a regular contributor of music and lyrics, and as the producer of many of its music albums. In the process, he has won two Grammy Awards and three Emmy Awards for songwriting and music production. Since writing and performing his first song for Sesame Street, \\"Count It Higher\\" (1973) in Season 5, Cerf has written or co-written over 200 songs featured on the program, including \\"Put Down the Duckie\\", \\"The Word Is No\\", \\"Dance Myself to Sleep\\", \\"Monster in the Mirror\\", and parody songs as \\"Born To Add\\", \\"Letter B\\", \\"Wet Paint\\", and \\"Furry Happy Monsters\\". Cerf also played a pivotal role in the ongoing funding of Sesame Street, founding and serving as the original editor-in-chief of Sesame Workshop's books, records, and toys division. In addition to his contributions to Sesame Street, Cerf's musical material has appeared on Saturday Night Live, The National Lampoon Radio Hour, The Electric Company, Square One Television, Between the Lions, and in numerous Muppet productions, and his songs have been performed by such stars as Paul Simon, Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, R.E.M., James Taylor, Tony Bennett, Dixie Chicks, Tracy Chapman, Carol Channing, Randy Travis, The Four Tops, Melissa Etheridge, Smokey Robinson, Bonnie Raitt, Wynton Marsalis, Little Richard, B.B. King, Jimmy Buffett, Bart Simpson, and the Metropolitan Opera's José Carreras--not to mention the blond, curly-haired Muppet character from Sesame Street who is his namesake and the lead singer of the rock group \\"Chrissy and the Alphabeats.\\"  1963-70: Cerf at Random House  Before joining Sesame Street, Cerf spent eight years as a senior editor at Random House (co-founded by his father in 1927), where he worked with such diverse authors as George Plimpton, Andy Warhol, Abbie Hoffman, Ray Bradbury, Richard Fariña, and Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel). In 1993, Cerf renewed his ties to Random House when he assumed the role of Chairman of the Modern Library's Board of Advisors.  Collaborations with Marlo Thomas  One of Christopher Cerf's best-known projects was the editing and production of Marlo Thomas & Friends' Free to Be... a Family book, album and TV special. The book reached #1 on The New York Times bestseller list within a week of its publication in 1987, and the show received a prime-time Emmy as the year's outstanding children's special. Cerf and Thomas collaborated again, co-editing and co- producing Thanks & Giving: All Year Long, a book and CD about generosity and sharing (and their polar opposites, selfishness and thoughtlessness). Royalties from the project, for which Thomas and Cerf won a 2006 Grammy Award, go to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, founded by Thomas' father, Danny Thomas, in 1962.  Between the Lions  Cerf served as Executive Producer, and Music and Audio Producer, of Between the Lions, the children's literacy series that his company, Sirius Thinking, Ltd., created for PBS. Between the Lions has twice won the Television Critics' Award as the nation's outstanding children's television program, and, in its first six seasons on the air, the show amassed six Emmy Awards. (In 2006, Between the Lions was nominated for three more Emmys, including Outstanding Children's Show.) In two independent studies, conducted by the University of Kansas and Mississippi State University, the program has also demonstrated success in helping children – including those at the highest risk of literacy failure – to learn how to read.  Lomax, the Hound of Music  Cerf continued to cement his role in the history of children's educational programming by producing fun educational shows for children. In 2008, Cerf served as co-Creator (with Norman Stiles and Louise Gikow), Executive Producer and Writer of the PBS Kids show Lomax, the Hound of Music. The show, which debuted in the winter of 2008, was a children's series featuring \\"a good-natured, melody-obsessed puppet pooch named Lomax, his fluffy feline sidekick Delta, and their human companion, Amy, on a tune-filled train ride crisscrossing the musical landscape of America. With the help - and full participation - of real kids on the train, on location, and the viewers at home, Lomax and his friends doggedly pursue their mutual passion: tracking down the wonderful songs that form the heart of our nation's diverse musical heritage.\\" In addition to being fun for the whole family, the show had true educational credentials. Aware that many American children do not receive any formal musical education, Cerf, Stiles and Gikow based Lomax on the music education curriculum created by the music educator John Feierabend, Ph.D. Feierabend's curriculum has been extensively researched and shown to increase children's musical ability and intelligence. It included appearances by music notables such as Larry Campbell and Tom Chapin. Lomax ran for one season.  Humorous writings  Christopher Cerf is perhaps best known to the general public for his work as an author and satirist. In 1970, he helped launch the National Lampoon, serving as a Contributing Editor from its first issue until the mid-1970s, and in 1978, he co-conceived and co-edited with Tony Hendra, George Plimpton and Rusty Unger the journalistic parody Not the New York Times. The Experts Speak, the \\"compendium of authoritative misinformation\\" that Cerf co-authored with Victor Navasky in 1984, has recently been reissued. In 1986, Cerf collaborated with National Lampoon colleague Henry Beard on The Pentagon Catalog: Ordinary Products at Extraordinary Prices, which offered readers the historic opportunity to obtain a free hex nut--valued at $2,043 by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation--with every copy they purchased. (The book has a die-cut hole in its front cover and first few pages: the book was sold in clear plastic shrink wrap with a steel hex nut inside this hole, slightly less than flush with the cover. The shrink wrap displayed the hex nut and prevented it from falling out before the book was purchased.) The Official Politically Correct Dictionary, also written with Beard, first appeared in 1992. In 2008, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of George W. Bush's victory speech aboard the U. S. S. Lincoln, Cerf again collaborated with Victor Navasky to produce Mission Accomplished! based on America's military presence in Iraq. Objections to the use of his music to break captive's will In December 2008, the Associated Press reported that various musicians were coordinating their objections to the use of their music as a technique for softening up captives. The songs used were primarily heavy metal, but included songs from Sesame Street. The Associated Press reported that Cerf \\"was horrified to learn songs from the children's TV show were used in interrogations\\". As a consequence, he researched how music is being used for military purposes and published his findings in the documentary movie Songs of War. Selected bibliography * Alligator, with Michael K.

Broadly, Bloom terms \\"Schools of Resentment\\" approaches associated with Marxist critical theory, including African-American studies, Marxist literary criticism, New Historicist criticism, feminist criticism and poststructuralism—specifically as promoted by Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. The School of Resentment is usually defined as all scholars who wish to enlarge the Western canon by adding to it more works by authors from minority groups without regard to aesthetic merit and/or influence over time, or those who argue that some works commonly thought canonical promote sexist, racist or otherwise biased values and should therefore be removed from the canon. Bloom contends that the School of Resentment threatens the nature of the canon itself and may lead to its eventual demise. Philosopher Richard Rortyhttp://www.robertounger.com/english/pdfs/discussions2.pdf agreed that Bloom is at least partly accurate in describing the School of Resentment, writing that those identified by Bloom do in fact routinely use \\"subversive, oppositional discourse\\" to attack the canon specifically and Western culture in general. Yet “this school deserves to be taken seriously—more seriously than Bloom’s trivialization of it as mere resentment” (Shifting the Scene: Shakespeare in European Culture, edited by Ladina Bezzola Lambert). Description Bloom outlines the term \\"School of Resentment\\" in the introduction to his book The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages (1994). Bloom stresses that he does not necessarily object to analysis and discussion of social and political issues in literature, but expresses indignation toward college literature professors who teach their own political motives through literature more than the aesthetics of literary worth. In his book, Bloom defends the Western canon of literature from this \\"School of Resentment\\", which in his view threatens to break down the canon through the insertion of potentially inferior literary works for political purposes. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary aesthetic pleasure and self-insight rather than the \\"forces of resentment\\" or a goal of \\"improving\\" one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: \\"The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading Shakespeare is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools.\\" His position is that politics has no place in literary criticism: a feminist or Marxist reading of Shakespeare's Hamlet would reveal something about feminism or Marxism, he says, but likely nothing about Hamlet itself. Responses Similar critical arguments have been made by others, without necessarily using the term \\"School of Resentment\\" to describe the movements critiqued. American philosopher Stephen Hicks,Stephen R.C. Hicks, Ph.D. (2004) Understanding Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault. Scholargy Publishing, p. 190-191. who notes that leftist academics (e.g., feminist Kate Ellis) have written extensively about post- structuralist teaching methods allegedly aimed at eroding the beliefs of young college students and replacing them with leftist ideologies: \\"[R]elativistic arguments are arrayed only against the Western great books canon. If one's deepest goals are political, one always has a major obstacle to deal with—the powerful books written by brilliant minds on the other side of the debate. ... Deconstruction allows you to dismiss whole literary and legal traditions as built upon sexist or racist or otherwise exploitative assumptions. It provides a justification for setting them aside.\\" In a 2015 interview, art critic and dissident feminist Camille Paglia defended Bloom—who was her mentor during her studies at Yale University—and said that literary canons are meant to come not from professors' wishes to \\"intensify their power\\" but from careful evaluations of which literary works have proven most influential over time. Paglia further argued that the introduction of politics into literary criticism (e.g., the view that no book which demeans women can be great literature) can enable a dangerous and Stalinist view of art wherein all art is \\"subordinate to a prefab political agenda\\".

The population in 2011 was 4,433,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 26.65 km². History The clock/bell tower of the medieval Church of São Nicolau The occupation of the territory of Mesão Frio dates back to the Romans, who occupied a castro in the area around Cidadelhe (from excavations encountered in this location).Luís Alberto Azevedo (2009), p.20 The early nucleu of the modern Mesão Frio was founded near the Church of São Nicolau, which was erected on the instruction of Queen Maud of Savoy, Afonso Henriques' wife. Mesão Frio was an early shelter on the Roman roadway; it was initially a respect, successively serving travellers, stabling horses and providing fresh animals, the settlement itself evolving approximately in the 3rd century, from the Latin “mansionis frigidae”.It was one ltinerarium Antonini Augusti that identified the many \\"mansiones\\" that existed in the region, and specified the distance between theme (during the Roman occupation that lasted between 197 BC and 411 AD) Even before the establishment of a Kingdom of Portugal, the territory was occupied by Subei, Visigoths and Arabs, and for a time were the lands of Penaguião, extending between the Douro and Corgo Rivers, the sierra of Marão and the lands of Panóias (Vila Real).Luís Alberto Azevedo (2009), p.21 The first medieval references to Mesão Frio appeared in the correspondence of Henrique, Count of Portugal, where it was called “Meijon- Frio”. Its name evolved over centuries with the Portuguese language taking on variations that included: Meijon Frio, Meijó Frio, Mey Johan Frio, Meyon Frio, Meyão Frio and Mezam Frio, until reaching its current variation. At one time, there was a legend that the toponymy was attributed to Esteves Gracia Monzon Friwn, who in 942 (during the reign of Ramiro II of León) entered along the Douro River with French knights whom took lands and rechristened them. This origin story was supported by the existence of six tombs within the Church of São Nicolau. The funerary monument was sculpted with the coat of arms of French knights, at a time when French knights crossed the territory during the Reconquista (718-1492). The first foral was allocated by Afonso Henriques in February 1152, and later confirmed by Afonso II on 15 October 1217, while the King was Trancoso. Three days before St. Andrew's Day in 1513, King Manuel I of Portugal renovated the foral (a copy of which is located in the municipal archive). At one time, this place was the residence for masons who constructed the bridge erected in Barqueiros (by Queen Maud whose husband had left 3000 Maravedi in his testament for the same). During this medieval period, the settlement was actually divided in two, each with its own master mason, judge and officials (this division actually physically existed until about 1948). Mesão Frio, during the reign of Manuel I, already included the settlements of Cidadelhe and Vila Marim, in addition to the original parishes of São Nicolau and Santa Cristina, as well as a parcel of the Vila Jusã that included the village called Meigõ frio de Jusão, alongside the ecclesiastical parish of Meigõ Frio de Susão. The settlements of Barqueiros, Oliveira and Vila Jusã were annexed much later; Barqueiros, a municipality at the time, and the colonies of Oliveira and Vila Jusã, which belonged to Penaguião, were joined to the municipality of Mesão Frio on 6 November 1836.Luís Alberto Azevedo (2009), p.22 With the export of wine during the 17th and 18th century, vineyards began to extend along the Douro River valley bringing a mature level of economic growth. But, the temptation of easy money caused many producers to alter the quality of Douro wines, resulting in poorer quality wines, and a fall in exports. In order to remedy this situation the Marquess of Pombal created the \\"Zona de Produção de Vinhos Generosos do Douro\\" to designate the region as a producer of elevated quality wines, and eliminate poorer quality producers. Troops of French General Loison were responsible for fires and destruction in the region in 1808. Geography=Physical geography Mesão Frio, is located 85 kilometres from Porto, 39 kilometres from Vila Real (the district capital) and 12 kilometres from Peso da Régua (its closest neighbour). It is limited in the north and east by the municipality of Peso da Régua, south by Resende and Lamego (along their Douro River frontier) and in the west by the municipality of Baião, in the district of Porto. From the “Estudos de Caracterização do Território Municipal do PDM”, the municipality is identified by three geological areas: one associated with the Douro region, another that includes the sierra of Marão and farther east, an area of granite that extends to the west of the municipality. The ancient deposition of sedimentary layers that were later transformed resulting in a dominant formation of pre-Cambrian and Cambrian sediments. It was these structures that developed into the metamorphic rocks of the Douro Group, consisting of schists and greywackes.Luís Alberto Azevedo (2009), p.24 The schists, which include layers of faulted rocks (formations created during the Ordovician-Silurian periods) consist of an inferior layer of conglomerate Ordovician sediments of schists and metamorphic greywackes, as well as a layer of quartzite and schists with magnetic layering. In the area of Barqueiros, there are derivative metamorphic rocks (clays, chiastolitic and interspersed schists) which resulted from granitic intrusions in the past. These granites pertain to the larger granitic region, consisting of granite or silicate cliffs with crystals of feldspar of a medium to fine quality.< Sedimentary formations, refer to primarily the modern deposits along the margins of the Douro, creating terraces, sands and other alluvial deposits. The region is bisected by a fault that cuts the municipality along a northwest by southeast alignment, in addition to a direction north-northeast by south-southeast. The regions relief is primarily motivated by the Serra do Marão which is subdivided by the Douro River valley, forming linear hilltops where many of the principal settlements exist. Many of the watersheds are drained by tributaries of the Douro that have, although a low intensity flow, carved out deep valleys (such as the Teixeira and Semenha River). Monte de São Silvestre, in the parish of Vila Jusã, is the highest point in the municipality (located at 531 metres above sea level), while the lowest point is in the Porto de Rei, in Barqueiros (50 metre above the river). Climate Located in the southern flank of the Serra do Marão and on the right margin of the Douro, the region is marked by distinct climatic regions. The northern zone, owing to the mountainous Serra do Marão, has a climate characteristic of the Terras Frias Transmontanas: temperatures are relatively low (annual means between 10 °C and 12.5 °C) and exposed to colder winds and precipitation (annually in excess of 1600 millimetres).Luís Alberto Azevedo (2009), p.25 The southeastern zone, with minor humidity and reduced altitudes, has less precipitation. The localities here are between 400 and 700 metres in altitude (such as Vila Marim and Brunhais), and although the winters continue to be cold, they are less sevre, and the summers are shorter and warmer (with temperatures between 12.5 °C and 14 °C). In the valleys of the Douro, Teixeira and Sermenha (areas of 400 metres and less in altitude) the temperatures and climate are almost Mediterranean. These areas have annual temperatures of 14 °C and area commonly referred to as part of the Terras Quentes Transmontanas. Human geography The evolution of the resident population of Mesão Frio has diminished recent years; between 1991 and 2001, the population in the municipality decreased from 5519 to 4926.Luís Alberto Azevedo (2009), p.30 Similar decreases occurred between the period 1960 and 2001 where the resident population dropped by 2498 inhabitants. The only exception occurring after the return of colonial immigrants and military after the independence of many of the Portuguese Colonial dependencies.. Although the primary level of government is the municipal authority, the local administration is operated by civil parish boards (). The municipality is divided into 5 civil parishes (freguesias): * Barqueiros * Cidadelhe * Oliveira * Mesão Frio (Santo André) * Vila Marim Notable citizens José Maria Alpoim, one of the architects of the Republican revolution of 1910 * José Maria de Alpoim Cerqueira Borges Cabral (Santa Cristina; 2 June 1858 - Lisbon, 12 December 1916) was a politician, member of the Progressive Party of Portugal, and later the Republican Party of Portugal, who held various roles during the last years of the constitutional monarchy in Portugal, and was responsible for providing bombs, arms and money to republican conspirators involved in the Lisbon Regicide. Later, as well as holding positions in the Ministry of Justice after his exile in Salamanca, he held minor roles in the First Portuguese Republic. The public garden in Mesão Frio, along with an avenue that bears his name (Avenida Conselheiro José Maria Alpoim) and, in front of the municipal grounds, a bust of José Maria de Alpoim was erected in 1923.

HP Labs' headquarters is in Palo Alto, California and the group has research and development facilities in Bristol, UK. The development of programmable desktop calculators, inkjet printing, and 3D graphics are credited to HP Labs researchers. HP Labs was established on March 3, 1966, by founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard, seeking to create an organization not bound by day-to-day business concerns. HP Labs was created with the help of former Bell Labs engineer and MOSFET (MOS transistor) inventor Mohamed Atalla, who later left in 1972. The labs have downsized dramatically; in August 2007, HP executives drastically diminished the number of projects, down from 150 to 30. As of 2018, HP Labs has just over 200 researchers, compared to earlier staffing levels of 500 researchers. With the Hewlett Packard Enterprise being spun off from Hewlett-Packard in November 1, 2015 and renamed to and HP Inc., the research lab also spun off Hewlett Packard Labs to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Labs was kept for HP Inc. Research areas As the Semiconductor Lab's first manager, Mohamed Atalla (who previously invented the MOSFET at Bell Labs) launched a material science investigation program that provided a base technology for gallium arsenide, gallium arsenide phosphide and indium arsenide devices. These devices became the core technology used by HP's Microwave Division to develop sweepers and network analyzers that pushed 2040 GHz frequency, giving HP more than 90% of the military communications market by the 1970s. HP Labs was involved in HP's research and development (R&D;) on practical light-emitting diodes (LEDs) between 1966 and 1969. The first practical LED displays were built at Atalla's Semiconductor Lab. HP introduced the first commercial LED display in 1968. In February 1969, they introduced the HP Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator. It was the first intelligent LED display, and was a revolution in digital display technology, replacing the Nixie tube and becoming the basis for later LED displays. In 1977, HP Labs fabricated prototypes of the DMOS (double-diffused MOSFET), a type of power MOSFET. They demonstrated that it was superior to the VMOS (V-groove MOSFET) with its lower on-resistance and higher breakdown voltage. The DMOS became the most common power transistor used in power electronics. Today, HP Labs specializes in products and solutions related to laptops and tablets, desktop computers, printers, ink and toner cartridges, display accessories and business solutions. 3D printing HP Labs has made a substantial investment in the development of HP MultiJet Fusion technology.

This family is part of the superfamily Percoidea of the order Perciformes. Characteristics The Terapontidae is a large family of small to medium- sized perciform fishes which occur in marine, brackish and fresh waters in the Indo-Pacific region. They are characterised by a single long-based dorsal fin which has a notch marking the boundary between the spiny and soft-rayed portions. They have small to moderate-sized scales, a continuous lateral line reaching the caudal fin, and most species lack teeth on the roof of the mouth. The marine species are found in inshore sea and brackish waters, some species are able to enter extremely saline and fresh waters. In Australia and New Guinea there are a number of species restricted to fresh water.

It includes three theatres: the Richard Burton Theatre, the Bute Theatre, and the Caird Studio. It also includes one concert hall, the Dora Stoutzker Hall. Its alumni include Anthony Hopkins, Aneurin Barnard and Rob Brydon. History and description The College was established in 1949 as Cardiff College of Music at Cardiff Castle, but has since moved to purpose-built accommodation within the castle grounds of Bute Park near Cardiff University. In 1970 it changed its name to the Welsh College of Music & Drama before being awarded its Royal title in The Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, making it the fifth conservatoire to be awarded this title. From 1973, the College's degrees were awarded by the University of Wales and in 2004 the College became part of the federal university. In 2007, however, it left the university and agreed to a merger (referred to as a \\"strategic alliance\\") with the University of Glamorgan. The University of Glamorgan merged with the University of Wales, Newport in 2013 to form the University of South Wales, so RWCMD is now part of the University of South Wales Group. The college provides education and training in the performing arts and technical theatre, with approximately two-thirds of its 550 students studying music-related courses and the rest studying drama and technical theatre related courses. It was the first, and is one of only two All-Steinway conservatoires in the UK, along with Leeds College of Music. A £22.5m expansion of the College was opened in 2011, including two new performance venues (Richard Burton Theatre and Dora Stoutzker Hall), a new front of house area and rehearsal studios. In 2010, as part of the College's 60th anniversary celebrations, students from the College performed in a gala concert at Buckingham Palace, attended by the College's Patron the Prince of Wales. A second gala evening was presented at Buckingham Palace in 2016 to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the College's new facilities. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools.  Undergraduate degrees  The College offers undergraduate degrees in the following areas: * BMus (Hons) Music * BMus (Hons) Jazz * BA (Hons) Acting * BA (Hons) Stage Management & Technical Theatre * BA (Hons) Design for Performance  Postgraduate degrees  The College also offers postgraduate degrees in the following areas; * MA Acting for Stage, Screen & Radio * MA Advanced Opera Performance * MA Arts Management * MA Design for Performance * MA Jazz * MA Musical Theatre * MA Opera Directing * MA Repetiteur Studies * MA Stage & Event Management * MMus Brass Band Conducting * MMus Choral Conducting * MMus Collaborative Piano * MMus Composition * MMus Historical Performance * MMus Music Performance * MMus Multi Instrument Woodwind Performance * MMus Orchestral Conducting * MMus Orchestral Performance * Postgraduate Diploma Advanced Professional Practice * Postgraduate Diploma in Brass Band Conducting * Postgraduate Diploma in Choral Conducting * Postgraduate Diploma in Collaborative Piano * Postgraduate Diploma in Composition * Postgraduate Diploma in Historical Performance * Postgraduate Diploma in Jazz * Postgraduate Diploma in Music Performance * Postgraduate Diploma in Multi Instrument Woodwind Performance * Postgraduate Diploma in Orchestral Conducting * Postgraduate Diploma in Orchestral Performance Alumni Anthony Hopkins Centre : For a full list, see :Category:Alumni of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama * Alexander Vlahos * Joe Blackman * Edward Bluemel * Greg Bowen * Anthony Boyle * Rob Brydon * Alun Cochrane * Anthony Hopkins * Ruth Jones * Jo Joyner * James Loye * Eve Myles * Kimberley Nixon * Tony Maudsley * Paul Hilton * Hamish Clark * Julian Lewis Jones * Naomi Radcliffe * Aneurin Barnard * Adrian Lewis Morgan * Rakie Ayola * David Thaxton * Jan Anderson * Steven Meo * Zahra Ahmadi * Dougray Scott * Peter Karrie * Lucy Gaskell * Ben Slade (joint course with UWIC) * Gill Walsh * Mary Woodvine * Victoria Wicks * Ieuan Rhys * Richard Elis * James Sutton * Andrew Harwood Mills ReferencesExternal links * * Category:University of South Wales Category:Drama schools in the United Kingdom Category:Music schools in Wales Category:Education in Cardiff Category:Educational institutions established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in Wales Category:Music in Cardiff Category:Organisations based in Wales with royal patronage ","title":"Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama"},{"id":"4466562","text":"Dunnett is a surname.

The Lenggong valley in Hulu Perak is one of Peninsular Malaysia's most important areas for archaeology, as excavations have revealed many traces of Malaysia's prehistory. It is the site of the oldest known place of human activity in the Peninsula. Today it is still a rural area, with small kampongs surrounded by green vegetation and limestone hills. Lenggong can be likened to an open-air museum, and is home to legends, skeletons, cave drawings and precious finds such as jewellery, pottery, weapons and stone tools. Many of the caves in the Lenggong area have revealed evidence of ancient humans having lived and hunted in this area. The Lenggong Valley was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site on 30 June 2012. Lenggong town Lenggong town A road in the lush greenery surrounding Lenggong. Lenggong is accessible by trunk roads connecting it with neighbouring towns and cities. The town of Lenggong is situated some 100 kilometres north of Ipoh on the Kuala Kangsar to Grik road (highway 76). The road to Lenggong is surrounded mostly by oil palm estates and jungles. As cows and buffalo are part of the agriculture, they are often seen along the road. The jungles (about million years old) are now in danger of heavy illegal logging. To visit Lenggong, from the North–South Expressway take Exit No.143 at Kuala Kangsar – that's about 3 hours away from Kuala Lumpur. Then take Route 76 to Lenggong. The new highway is open and has replaced the old scenic kampung road. Lenggong federal constituency and autonomous sub-district Hulu Perak, with Lenggong (Kenering, Lenggong, Kota Tampan, Temelong, Durian Pipit) The Lenggong federal constituency is represented in the Dewan Rakyat of the Malaysian Parliament by Dato Shamsul Anuar bin Haji Nasarah from UMNO. Lenggong also contributes two seats to the Perak State Legislative Assembly: Kota Tampan and Kenering, which were also held by UMNO. Lenggong is also an autonomous sub-district (daerah kecil), consisting of Lenggong town and the nearby communes of Durian Pipit and Temelong. Archaeology Malaysia is considered a very young country archaeologically with a very recent prehistory. In Africa, the predecessors of the human species originated about 3 – 5 million years ago. Their descendants migrated out of Africa and their prehistoric remains have been found all over Europe and Asia. Both Java Man and Peking Man date back to about 300,000 years ago. In Malaysia, the earliest remains is a human skull found in the Niah Caves in Sarawak and dates back some 40,000 years. In Semenanjung (Peninsula) Malaysia, the story is even more recent and starts in Lenggong about 31,000 years ago. Incidentally, many people think of the Bujang Valley in Kedah as being one of the oldest sites, but its history only stretches back about 1,500 years. All the archaeological remains found in Lenggong have been associated with caves. The two exceptions are the Kota Tampan and Bukit Jawa sites. These two are Peninsular Malaysia's only Palaeolithic sites. Kota Tampan is the earliest known site of human inhabitation. Excavations at Kota Tampan which began in 1938 revealed an undisturbed stone tool production area. Pebble tools were made using equipment such as anvils and hammer stones. Some 50,000 pieces of stone have been found and recorded. The culture at Kota Tampan is referred to as Tampanian. The workshop was initially dated at 30,000 years old, but this figure has now been revised to 75,000 years. Although the Kota Tampan workshop site is currently on a hillside, and in an oil palm plantation, the original site was on a lake shore. It is thought that the workshop was disbanded roughly 75,000 years ago due to a volcanic eruption at Lake Toba in Sumatra, some 250 kilometres away. There is a large gap of some 17,000 years between Kota Tampan and the next archaeological site, Gua Gunung Runtuh, which has been attributed to the devastating effects of the Toba eruption. More recently, a team has been excavating a site at Bukit Jawa, and this has been dated at 200,000 years old. Bukit Jawa is therefore far older than the Kota Tampan workshop, which is just 6 km away. The Lenggong Valley in upper Perak, is an important archaeological site where evidences of human settlement from the Palaeolithic age were found. Important archaeological sites include Kota Tampan, Bukit Jawa at Kampung Gelok and Kampung Temelong. The most famous archaeological findings in Lenggong was Perak Man, the 11,000 years old human skeletal remains which was discovered in 1991. 100,000-year-old stone tools have been excavated at Kampung Geluk and Kampung Temelong. There has also been proof that Gua Harimau was a site of bronze manufacture during the Bronze Age. There is also the Lenggong Archaeological Museum at Kota Tampan where artefacts excavated from the area are displayed. The museum is located within an oil palm estate on the road from Kuala Kangsar to Gerik (or Grik). Lenggong's prehistory extends back to the Palaeolithic or old Stone Age, but most sites are more recent, from the Neolithic or new Stone Age. The Palaeolithic period occurred from 2 million – 10,000 years ago, and the people at that time were the first tool makers, who lived by hunting and gathering. During the new Stone Age the tools had been improved, and pottery was used, and the people practised farming. All the archaeological remains found in Lenggong have been associated with caves, with the exception of Kota Tampan and Bukit Jawa. There remain Peninsular Malaysia's only Palaeolithic sites. Gua Gunung Runtuh is situated in Bukit Kepala Gajah or Elephant's Head Hill. In the same hill other caves have yielded archaeological remains such as stone tools and food remnants, but no more skeletons. The caves were probably used as temporary shelters as seasonal or hunting camps, whereas Gua Gunung Runtuh was lived in for longer periods. The next oldest site is Gua Harimau or Tiger Cave. It is about 3 kilometres away from Gua Gunung Runtuh and is an isolated site, and was probably used as a burial ground some 5000 – 3000 years ago. Seven human skeletons have been found (but no tiger bones), also bronze axes, and various articles of jewellery such as chains, bangles, earrings and bead lockets. The bronze axes show that there was an early Bronze tradition in Malaysia, as well as in north Thailand and China. It is the earliest use of metal in south-east Asia. Porcelain containers of various shapes and sizes were also found containing meat and siput shells (a generic name for snails). Archaeological digs in other caves have revealed pottery, axes stone tools and flakes. Also food remains, and in some sites, human bones. Unfortunately some caves have been disturbed by guano diggers and any remains have therefore been lost. Gua Puteri is a natural tunnel which pierces Bukit Kajang. There are no archaeological findings here, but instead the cave is known for its legends. Two stalagmites are believed to be a prince and princess who guard the cave. Locals say that if children climb up the stalagmites they will fall sick. Negrito cave drawings have been found at various sites but are not prehistoric, as they are only about 100 years old. Gua Badak is one of the main places for these drawings, situated about 10 kilometres north of Lenggong. The Negritos are one of the aboriginal tribes of Malaysia. The Lanoh Negrito made the illustrative recordings of their every life. The charcoal drawings were first discovered and documented in the 1920s by Ivor Evans. They were then thought to have been lost by quarrying, but were rediscovered in 1992 and hopefully will now be preserved as a national heritage. Luckily most of the drawings survived the blasting, although some are missing, believed destroyed. And unfortunately modern graffiti covers some of the original drawings. Unlike cave art at places such as Lascaux in France, which date back some 15,000 years, the Negrito drawings are \\"modern\\" art. The Negritos used the caves as shelters during hunting trips. The sketches depict tribal art such as animals, people, trees, mats, and even bicycles and motorcars. Apart from the charcoal drawings, they made white pictures by scrapping away the limestone rock. The drawings are simple, featuring matchstick men. There is a man carrying a pole laden with coconuts. A bow and arrow symbolise the hunting tools which were replaced by the blowpipe. There are men on horses, a man with an elephant, a hunting party. Animals such as leaf monkeys, monitor lizards and porcupine all made for a good meal and were therefore illustrated. The Lanoh Negritos are still found in Perak today, generally working on rubber and oil palm estates, although some do still hunt. They are formed into six tribes. Most of the old troglodytes or cave dwellers of the Malay Peninsula temporarily lived in caves and rock shelters. They lived mainly by hunting, evidence shown by the remains of animal bones and molluscs. The people may have painted their bodies using red iron oxide. They used stones and slabs for grinding up substances such as salt, and all their tools were made of stones. Flakes were used as knives or scrappers. So it can be seen that the Lenggong area is very important as it contains much evidence relating to the prehistory of Malaysia. It is the oldest area where remains have been found, and all the sites are situated conveniently within a small area. Perak Man The oldest human skeleton found in Malaysia was at Gua Gunung Runtuh in the state of Perak in Peninsular Malaysia. The cave was his final resting place situated in Bukit Kepala Gajah or Elephant's Head Hill in the Lenggong Valley of Ulu Perak. The skeleton was a male with a height of approximately 157 cm, aged 50s. It was discovered in 1991 and the skeleton has been dated to around 11,000 years old and is one of the most complete skeletons for this time period in this region. In 2004, another skeleton was found at Gua Teluk Kelawar in Lenggong, Perak by a team of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) archaeologists. This time it is a 'Perak woman' of 148 cm in height and was believed to aged 40s. He was buried in the fetal position, with deposits of animal bones at his right shoulder, to his left and to his bottom, and deposits of stone tools around the body. There were no other burials in the cave. The Perak Man had a malformed left hand, his left arm and hand were much smaller compared to his right arm and hand. This deformity could be from a genetic disorder known as brachymesophalangia. This evidence is further supported by the fact that his spine is curved towards the right due to living with only one good hand. The Perak Man was probably a man as the bones exhibited strong male characteristics. His pelvis wasn't well preserved which is the surest way to determine a skeleton's gender. He shared the characteristics of an australomelanesoid, which is the kind of humans you find in Australia, Papua, Indonesia and some parts of Malaysia. He wasn't very tall, he stood about 154 cm, which is about 5 feet. The bones that were found deposited near him were identified to have come from wild boar, monkey, monitor lizard and deer and are thought to be food deposits. There were about ten stone tools scattered around the body, and most of them were pebble tools and some hammer stones. One conclusion that the study made was that he must have been an important member in that society because the burial was very elaborate and labour intensive. The Perak Man was put into the pit with food offerings, and then covered him with small shells, and then place more offerings and tools, and then another shell layer, followed by a final dirt layer. Furthermore, he was 45 years old which was very old for a person from that era with a disability. People had to take care of him – and people would not take it upon themselves unless he was respected or highly ranked in some sort of social hierarchy. That's another reason to support the social hierarchy theory. Of course, it's a bit premature to say all of this about the Perak Man and his society. We should take this with some caution because we don't have anything to benchmark with. Gua Teluk Kelawar is the cave where Perak Women was found. Perak Women is an 8000-year-old skeleton found in Gua Teluk Kelawar in Lenggong .Perak Women was found more recently in 2004 . Stone tools An undisturbed stone tool production area where pebble tools were made using equipment such as anvils and hammer stones was excavated at the Kota Tampan archaeological site. The workshop was dated at 75,000 years old.  Cuisine  Lenggong is also famous for its freshwater fish dishes. One local delicacy from freshwater fish is pekasam, where the fish is marinated in salt and toasted rice, followed by fermentation for two weeks.

When he saw different problems of the Qing Dynasty, he helped the poor to confront corrupt officials.

After Hudson merged with Nash Motors, the Wasp was then built by American Motors Corporation in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and marketed under its Hudson marque for model years 1955 and 1956. The Hudson Wasp can be classified by two distinct model year generations: from 1952 to 1954 when it used Hudson's existing short-wheelbase platform, and in 1955 and 1956 when it was built on the full-sized Nash platform, with completely different designs for each of these two model years.

The Wasp was available in two- and four-door sedan, convertible, and a 2-door hardtop designated the Hollywood. The Wasp was built on Hudson's shorter wheelbase, using the company's unitized, \\"Monobilt\\" step-down chassis design with an overall length of . Hudson's unitized structure used a perimeter frame which provided a rigid structure, low center of gravity, and side-impact protection for passengers. The base Hudson Wasp used the L-Head straight six from the Pacemaker. Hudson also offered the Super Wasp which used improved interior materials and a more powerful Hudson 6-cylinder engine. Instead of using the Pacemaker's straight 6, the Super Wasp used Hudson's L-Head six fed by a single 2-barrel carburetor. The engine was rated at (with single 2-barrel carburetor) while the top-of-the-line Commodore Custom Eight's straight 8 was rated at . The six's power was underrated so it would not outshine the flagship straight 8. The narrow block engine was the basis for the stroked and reinforced Hornet 6-cylinder engine, introduced in 1951 which dominated NASCAR from 1952 to 1954. The Super Wasp was also offered with an aluminum \\"twin H\\" manifold and twin 2-barrel carburetors. Super Wasp performance with the \\"twin H\\" induction matched the performance of the big 2-barrel equipped, but heavier, Hudson Hornet. Wasp model year production saw 21,876 units in 1953 and 17,792 units in 1954, its final year before the Hudson merger with Nash- Kelvinator Corporation.  1955  For 1955 the Wasp became a product of the newly formed American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the end of 1954 model year production, Hudson's Detroit manufacturing facility was closed and assembly of Hudson models was shifted to Nash's factory in Kenosha, Wisconsin. All Hudsons would be based on the senior Nash models, but would have exclusive Hudson styling. After Hudson's 1954 merger with Nash, 1955 Hudsons were built on the unitized Nash platforms. The 1955 Hornet was built on the 1955 Nash Ambassador platform and offered with the big Hornet I6 engine, as well as a detuned V8 engine supplied by Packard. The 1955 Hudson Wasp was built on the Nash Statesman platform. For 1955, the Wasp was offered with Hudson's I6 previously used in the Hudson Jet compact sedan and the Hudson Italia. The was offered with twin H Power and was rated at . The 1955 Hudsons used Nash's long travel coil spring suspension, integrated and advanced Heating and ventilation system and were offered with air conditioning and reclining seats. Although comfortable, the Nash-based Hudsons were no longer competitive on the race tracks where they dominated from 1952 to 1954. Hudson Wasp sales dropped to 7,191 units for the year as traditional Hudson buyers left the marque, viewing the cars as something less than the legendary Hudsons of the past.  1956  For the 1956 model year, AMC executives decided to give the Wasp and Hornet more character in hopes of boosting sales. However, the plan backfired. Design for the vehicles was given over to designer Richard Arbib, who provided Hudson with one of the more distinctive looks in 1950s, which he called \\"V-Line Styling\\". Taking the traditional Hudson triangle, Arbib applied its \\"V\\" form in every conceivable manner across the interior and exterior of the car. Arbib's front-end combined a tightly woven egg-crate grille (a nod to the 1931 Hudson Greater Eight) bisected by a prominent \\"V\\" (a nod to the 1954 Hudson Italia). Combined with tri-tone paint combinations, the Hudson's new look was unique. However, the plan to build a better Hudson identity failed; the car's garish design failed to excite buyers. The Wasp was available only as a four-door sedan and its sales fell to 2,519 units in its final year of production.  End of production  In 1957, AMC stripped Hudson of eleven of its fifteen models, including the Wasp. Australian assembly The Wasp was assembled in Australia from complete knock down (CKD) kits.

He was also interested in anthropology and neurology. Early life Samuel-Jean Pozzy (he changed the spelling later) was born in Bergerac, Dordogne to a family of Italian/Swiss descent. Samuel's father Benjamin Dominique Pozzy (20 March 1820 – 1905), a minister of the Reformed Church of France, married Marthe-Marie Inés Escot-Meslon (11 March 1821 – 1857) on 29 April 1844 in Bergerac, Dordogne, France. She died when Samuel was ten, and his father then married an Englishwoman, Mary Anne Kempe, on 19 October 1859 in Bakewell, Derbyshire, England. Pozzi went to study first to Pau and then to Bordeaux. For his handsome appearance and cultured demeanor, other pupils nicknamed him The Siren. Medical career thumb300px In 1864, Pozzi began to his study medicine in Paris. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, he volunteered and became a medic. Later he was one of the pupils of the neurologist Paul Broca and as his assistant he worked with anthropology, neurology and comparative anatomy. Pozzi graduated as a doctor in 1873. The subject of his first thesis was fistula of the ischio-rectal fossa (4). In 1875, Pozzi became a university teacher after his second thesis concerning the use of hysterotomy for uterine fibroids. In 1876, Pozzi traveled to Scotland to the Congress of the British Medical Association to meet Joseph Lister, whose interest in antiseptics he supported. In 1877, Pozzi became chirurgien des hôpitaux. Pozzi went to Austria, Germany and Britain to study gynecological methods and became one of the pioneers of gynecology in France. He gained a reputation as a teacher, preferring to make his rounds dressed in white overalls and wearing a black cap. In 1881, Pozzi became a hospital surgeon, specializing in gynecological and abdominal surgery. In 1883, he was appointed surgeon at the Hôpital de Lourcine-Pascal. After 1884 he gave theoretical lectures in the hospital. In 1888, he became a president of the Society of Anthropology – he had been a member since 1870. He traveled widely to supplement his knowledge. Pozzi established the first Chair of Gynecology in Paris in 1884. In 1889, he performed the first gastroenterostomy in France. In 1896, he was elected to the French Academy of Medicine. In 1897, he was a co-founder of the Revue de gynécologie et de chirurgie abdominale. In 1913, Pozzi and Georges Clemenceau organized the first transplant symposium in Paris. In 1914, he rejoined the army when the First World War broke out and became a military surgeon. Personal life John Singer Sargent, Dr. Pozzi at Home, 1881 In 1879, Pozzi married Therese Loth-Cazalis, heiress of a railroad magnate, and had three children: Catherine, Jean, and Jacques. His wife wanted her mother to live with them, which made for tensions in the marriage. Pozzi also had affairs: with the opera singer Georgette Leblanc, the actress Rejane, the widow of Georges Bizet, Sarah Bernhardt, and Emma Sedelmeyer Fischhof. The daughter of an art dealer and wife of a horse breeder, Fischhof was a beautiful, cultured woman of Jewish heritage who became Pozzi's mistress in 1890. His wife refused to grant him a divorce, but Fischhof remained his companion for the rest of his life. Relationship with Sarah Bernhardt In his early days in Paris, Pozzi had met Sarah Bernhardt through a childhood friend, the actor Jean Mounet-Sully. According to Gustave Schlumberger, they briefly became lovers, then remained lifelong friends afterwards. In 1898, he commissioned painter Georges Clairin—a longtime friend—to paint a painting for the wall of his Hospital, Lourcine. Sketches by Clairin from when he painted murals on the walls of Pozzi's house are included in the illustrations in The Diva and Dr God (1). In 1898, Bernhardt insisted on Pozzi operating on her ovarian cyst. In 1915, she called on him again, and Pozzi arranged for a colleague to amputate her damaged leg. Political and cultural interests Pozzi became an honorary member of the Cercle de l'Union artistique (known as the Mirlitons) in 1881, and met the painter John Singer Sargent. Sargent's 1881 portrait of Pozzi depicts him in a red dressing gown and is currently displayed at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Pozzi befriended Marcel Proust, Robert Proust, Reynaldo Hahn, and Robert de Montesquiou. In 1877 he came to know poet Louise Ackermann, when he asked her to teach him German. Salonniere Lydie Aubernon nicknamed him \\"the love doctor\\". He corresponded with a feminist writer Augustine Bulteau. He also collected coins and statuettes. In 1898 Pozzi was elected senator from Bergerac and represented his district for three years. He improved the water supply and sewer drainage of his town and was later involved with the restructuring of the French baccalaureate exams. He did not seek re-election in 1902. Pozzi witnessed the second trial of Alfred Dreyfus, and supported Émile Zola who believed that Dreyfus was innocent. In 1908 the ashes of Zola were transferred to the Pantheon and both Pozzi and Dreyfus were present. When the journalist Gregori shot at Dreyfus and wounded him on the arm, Pozzi rushed to his aid. Death Samuel Jean de Pozzi (1918) On 13 June 1918 Maurice Machu, former patient from two years before, approached Pozzi in his consulting room. Pozzi had operated on him for varicocele of the scrotum, and he believed he had become impotent as a result. Machu asked him to operate again. When Pozzi refused because he could not remedy the situation, Machu shot him four times in the stomach. Pozzi ordered himself to be taken to the Astoria Hospital, which had been converted into a military hospital for wounded from WW I, but the emergency laparotomy was unsuccessful. He asked to be buried in his military uniform and died shortly afterwards. Machu committed suicide later. Pozzi was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Bergerac. He was survived by his diplomat son Jean Pozzi and poet daughter Catherine Pozzi.

Huntington State Park is a public recreation area covering in the towns of Redding, Newtown, and Bethel in Fairfield County, Connecticut. The state park is noted for Anna Hyatt Huntington's sculptures of bears and wolves that welcome visitors at the park entrance. Her work can also be seen in the heroic sculpture of General Israel Putnam at Putnam Memorial State Park in Redding. The park bears the name of railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington, whose heirs donated the lands to the state. The park's web of multi-use trails is open to hikers, cyclists, and equestrians. The park is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History Under the late 19th-century ownership of Commodore Walther Luttgen, a New York banker, industrialist and yachtsman, park-like features were added to the landscape including service roads, trails, and artificial ponds. One of Luttgen's improvements, a miniature stone lighthouse, may still be seen. The remains of a small steam paddlewheeler that once plied the ponds have not been found. Joseph E. Sterrett, a principal with the accounting firm of Price, Waterhouse, acquired the estate, including its mansion, Villa Linta, following Luttgen's death in 1922. After Villa Linta burned down, the land was purchased by Archer M. Huntington, the philanthropist stepson of industrialist Collis Potter Huntington. He and his wife Anna Hyatt Huntington changed its name to Stanerigg and moved to the estate in 1939 to pursue their various interests: she as creator of works of realistic sculpture, he as poet, Spanish scholar, and patron of the arts.

The British recaptured the city of Lucknow which they had abandoned in the previous winter after the relief of a besieged garrison in the Residency, and destroyed the organised resistance by the rebels in the Kingdom of Awadh (or Oudh, as it was referred to in most contemporary accounts). Background Oudh had been annexed by the East India Company only a year before a general mutiny broke out in the Company's Bengal Army. The annexation had been accompanied by several instances of expropriation of royal and landholders' estates on sometimes flimsy grounds of non-payment of taxes, or difficulties in proving title to lands. Many sepoys (native soldiers) of the Company's Bengal Army had been recruited from high-caste and landowning communities in Oudh. There was increasing unrest in the Bengal Army, as privileges and customary allowances they had previously enjoyed were withdrawn. With uncertainty over their rights to property in Oudh, they felt that their status both as soldiers and citizens was under threat. When the rebellion broke out in May 1857, it threatened British authority in several areas of India, but most particularly in Oudh, where the resentful dispossessed rulers and landowners joined with the mutinied regiments (Bengal Native troops, and Oudh Irregular units formerly belonging to the Kingdom of Oudh) in what became a national rebellion. From 1 July to 26 November 1857, the British had withstood the siege of the Residency to the north of the city. When the besieged garrison was finally relieved by the British commander-in- chief, Sir Colin Campbell, the Residency was evacuated, as Campbell's communications were threatened. He returned to Cawnpore (Kanpur) from where the relief expedition had been mounted, with all the civilians evacuated from the Residency and the sick and wounded. However, he left a division of 4,000 men under Sir James Outram to hold the Alambagh, a walled park two miles south of the city. During the following winter campaigning season, Campbell re- established his communications with Delhi and with Calcutta. He also received fresh reinforcements from Britain and built up a substantial transport and supply column. After capturing Fatehgarh on 1 January 1858, which allowed him to establish control over the countryside between Cawnpore and Delhi, Campbell suggested leaving Oudh alone during 1858, concentrating instead on recapturing the state of Rohilkhand, which was also in rebel hands. However, the Governor General, Lord Canning, insisted that Oudh be recaptured, so as to discourage other potential rebels. Canning wrote > Oudh is not only the rallying point of the sepoys, the place to which they > all look, and by the doings in which their own hopes and prospects rise and > fall; but it represents a dynasty; there is a King of Oudh \\"seeking his > own\\".Edwardes, p.123The last phrase is associated with the proclamation of > Charles Edward Stuart, a pretender to the English and Scottish thrones, when > he launched an unsuccessful uprising in 1745 Campbell's advance Contemporary plan of the movements during the siege, relief and capture of Lucknow Campbell's army consisted of seventeen infantry battalions, twenty-eight cavalry squadrons and 134 guns and mortars,Hibbert, p.356 with a large and unwieldy baggage train and large numbers of Indian camp followers. The army crossed the Ganges River in late February, and advanced to rendezvous with Outram at the Alambagh on 1 March. The army was then reorganised into three infantry divisions under Outram, Brigadier Walpole and Brigadier Lugard, and a cavalry division under James Hope Grant. A force of 9,000 Nepalis (not to be confused with the regular Gurkha units of the Bengal Army) was approaching Lucknow from the north, commanded by Brigadier Franks. The defenders of Lucknow were said to number 100,000. This suspiciously large and round figure reflects the fact that the defenders lacked coordinated leadership, and were largely the personal retinues of landowners, or loosely organised bodies of fighters, whose motives, dedication and equipment varied widely. The British were not able to gain any reliable reports of their numbers. The rebels were nevertheless equipped with large numbers of cannon and had heavily fortified the Charbagh Canal, the city and the palaces and mosques adjoining the Residency to the north of the city. They had however not fortified the northern approaches to the city on the north bank of the Gumti River, which had not seen fighting previously. (During the British relief moves in 1857, the ground had been flooded by monsoon rains.) Campbell began by repeating his moves of the relief of the Residency the previous year. He moved to the east of the city and Charbagh Canal to occupy a walled park, the Dilkusha Park, although this time he suffered from rebel artillery fire until his own guns could be brought up. On 5 March, Campbell's engineers constructed two pontoon bridges across the Gumti. Outram's division crossed to the north bank, and by 9 March, they were established north of the city. Under covering fire from his siege guns, his division captured the grandstand of the King of Oudh's racecourse (known as the Chakar Kothi). Meanwhile, Campbell's main body captured La Martiniere (formerly a school for the children of British civilians) and forced their way across the Charbagh Canal with few casualties. Capture of the main defences Begum Kotee, or Queen's House, Lucknow, 1858. By 11 March, Outram captured two bridges across the Gumti near the Residency (an iron bridge and a nearby stone bridge) although heavy rebel artillery fire forced him to abandon the stone bridge. Meanwhile, Campbell occupied an enclosed palace (the Secundrabagh) and a mosque (the Shah Najaf) with little opposition; these two positions had been the scene of heavy fighting the previous November. In front of him was a block of palace buildings, collectively known as the Begum Kothi. There was severe fighting for these on 11 March, in which 600 or 700 rebels died. Over the next three days, Campbell's engineers and gunners blasted and tunnelled their way through the buildings between the Begum Kothi and the main rebel position in the King of Oudh's palace, the Kaisarbagh. Meanwhile, Outram's guns bombarded the Kaisarbagh from the north. The main assault on the Kaisarbagh took place on 14 March. Campbell's and Frank's forces attacked from the east, but Campbell surprisingly refused Outram permission to cross the Gumti and take the Kaisarbagh between two fires. As a result, although the Kaisarbagh was easily captured, its defenders were able to retreat without difficulty. Final capture of Lucknow Most of the rebels were abandoning Lucknow and scattering into the countryside. Campbell failed to stop most of them, by sending his cavalry after some rebels who had left earlier. Operations temporarily halted while the British reorganised and most regiments fell to looting the captured palaces. On 16 March, Outram finally recrossed the Gumti, and his division advanced on and stormed the Residency. There were disjointed rebel counter- attacks on the Alambagh and the British positions north of the Gumti, which failed. A rebel force which was supposed to contain Begum Hazrat Mahal, the wife of the dispossessed King of Oudh, and her son Birjis Qadra whom the rebels had proclaimed King, was driven from the Musabagh, yet another walled palace four miles northwest of Lucknow. The last rebels, 1,200 men under a noted leader, Ahmadullah Shah, also known as the Maulvi of Faizabad, were driven from a fortified house in the centre of the city on 21 March. The city was declared cleared on this date. Outcome Campbell had advanced cautiously and had captured Lucknow with few casualties, but by failing to prevent the rebels escaping, he was forced to spend much of the following summer and monsoon season clearing the rebels from the countryside of Oudh. As a result, his army suffered heavy casualties from heatstroke and other diseases. Outram had also failed to protest his orders not to advance on 14 March, which had allowed most rebels to escape. Outram was Civil Commissioner for Oudh in addition to his military command, and may have allowed his hopes for pacification and reconciliation to override his soldier's instincts. Rebel casualties were hard to estimate. British troops usually executed any prisoners they captured, whether armed or not. One of the prominent British casualties was William Hodson, who led an irregular cavalry unit and also served as an Intelligence officer, killed during the capture of the Begum Kothi on 11 March.

He had heard Othar Turner and others in nearby Como picnics, and cited Junior Kimbrough, Johnny Winter, and Johnny Shines as influences. Around 1971, beside working in construction, Brown began playing with two other musicians. Johnny Woods would make an occasional playing partner to his death in 1990.

The Methodist Church was itself formed from the merger of four smaller Methodist denominations with ties to British and US Methodist denominations. History Laurence Coughlan was a lay preacher of the British Methodist movement. He arrived in Newfoundland in 1766 and began working among Protestant English and Irish settlers. In 1779 William Black, born in England but raised in Nova Scotia was converted to Methodism and commenced evangelizing in the Maritimes, his work falling under the supervision of the British Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1800. In 1855 this body formed the Wesleyan Methodist Conference of Eastern British America.Victor Shepherd (2001), \\"The Methodist Tradition in Canada.\\" Retrieved July 17, 2016. Under the leadership of William Losee, meanwhile, the Methodist Episcopal Church in the US, established on Christmas Day in 1784, began work in 1791 among British immigrants to Upper Canada. By 1828 the Methodist Episcopal work in Canada had formally severed ties with the US. In 1833 most of it joined with the British Wesleyans to form the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada, adding to itself the Methodist people of Lower Canada in 1854. That part of it which absented itself from the union re-formed into the Methodist Episcopal Church of Canada in 1834, eventually growing into the second largest Methodist body in Canada. In turn the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada and the Wesleyan Methodist Conference of Eastern British America united in 1874, annexing as well the Methodist New Connexion Church in Canada (itself an amalgam of several small groups), thereby forming the Methodist Church of Canada. In 1884 this body joined with the Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada, together with the Bible Christian Church of Canada and the Primitive Methodist Church in Canada, bringing to birth the Methodist Church, with churches in Canada, Newfoundland (which at the time was not part of the Canadian Confederation) and Bermuda. This lattermost union made the Methodist Church the largest Protestant denomination in Canada. It now included all Canadian Methodists with the exception of several very small groups: the British Methodist Episcopal Church (a development of the African Methodist Episcopal Church serving chiefly people of colour), two German-speaking bodies (the Evangelical Association and the United Brethren in Christ), and the Free Methodist Church (a body that had begun in New York State in 1860 and extended itself into Canada.) Merger with United Church In 1925 the Methodist Church united with 70% of the Presbyterian Church in Canada and 96% of the Congregational Union of Canada to form The United Church of Canada. The Methodist Church with its notable benefactors the Eaton and Massey families was the sponsor of Victoria College at the University of Toronto, once and still a mainstay of intellectual rigour at that university, and the alma mater of many of Canada's leaders and most famous thinkers. Although Methodists were never a majority of anglophone Canadians or even Torontonians, they exerted significant political and social influence in southern Ontario generally and Toronto particularly. Many of the causes espoused by and associated with the United Church in the 20th century were, although also associated with other Evangelical Protestant denominations, especially Methodist ones, in particular sabbatarianism, temperance, the rights of women and missions to the aboriginal peoples of Canada. Although Methodism in Canada abandoned that label in 1925 — many United Church people in Canada are entirely unaware of the term — the foremost Canadian Methodist, Egerton Ryerson, is amply commemorated and widely known through the many Canadian institutions which bear his name, including Ryerson University, the former Ryerson Press (the United Church publishing house, ultimately sold to McGraw-Hill) and numerous Ryerson United Churches across the country.

Found in John , it describes Jesus' disciples as branches of himself, who is described as the \\"true vine\\", and God the Father the \\"husbandman\\". Old Testament There are numerous Old Testament passages which refer to the people of Israel as a vine ( gephen): , , , , , and , and . The Old Testament passages which use this symbolism appear to regard Israel as faithful to God and/or the object of severe punishment. Ezek 15:1–8 in particular talks about the worthlessness of wood from a vine (in relation to disobedient Judah). A branch cut from a vine is worthless except to be burned as fuel. This appears to fit more with the statements about the disciples than with Jesus’ description of himself as the vine. Ezek 17:5–10 contains vine imagery which refers to a king of the house of David, Zedekiah, who was set up as king in Judah by Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah allied himself to Egypt and broke his covenant with Nebuchadnezzar (and therefore also with God), which would ultimately result in his downfall (17:20–21). Ezek 17:22–24 then describes the planting of a cedar sprig which grows into a lofty tree, a figurative description of the Messiah. But it is significant that Messiah himself is not described in Ezekiel 17 as a vine, but as a cedar tree. The vine imagery here applies to Zedekiah’s disobedience. Is it a parable? Icon of Christ as the true Vine Several authors such as Barbara Reid, Arland Hultgren or Donald Griggs comment that \\"parables are noticeably absent from the Gospel of John\\".Barbara Reid, 2001 Parables for Preachers page 3Arland J. Hultgren, 2002 The Parables of Jesus page 2Donald L. Griggs, 2003 The Bible from scratch page 52 According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"There are no parables in St. John's Gospel\\"; and according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"Here Jesus' teaching contains no parables and but three allegories, the Synoptists present it as parabolic through and through.\\" These sources all suggest that the passage is better described as a metaphor than a parable. Some writers, however, notably John Calvin, referred to the passage by a Latin term that is typically translated into English as a \\"parable\\". Text John 15:1–17 reads in the Douay–Rheims Bible: > I am the true vine; and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me, > that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, > he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit. Now you are clean by > reason of the word, which I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you. > As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so > neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine: you the branches: he > that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without > me you can do nothing. If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as > a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into > the fire, and he burneth. If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you > shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you.

If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; as I also > have kept my Father's commandments, and do abide in his love. These things I > have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled. > This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you. > Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his > friends.

He published only a few stories and essays in his lifetime; the majority of his writings were published posthumously. Life Krzhizhanovsky was born in Kiev to a Polish family on 11 February 1887.Adam Thirlwell, \\"Master of the Crossed Out,\\" The New York Review of Books, vol. LVIII, no. 11 (June 23, 2011), p. 57. Krzhizhanovsky was active among Moscow's literati in the 1920s, while working for Alexander Tairov's Chamber Theater. Several of Krzhizhanovsky's stories became known through private readings and a few publications. His writing style might have been influenced by Robert Louis Stevenson, G. K. Chesterton, Edgar Allan Poe, Nikolai Gogol, E. T. A. Hoffmann, and H. G. Wells. In 1929 he penned a screenplay for Yakov Protazanov's acclaimed film The Feast of St Jorgen, yet his name did not appear in the credits. He also wrote the screenplay for the 1935 stop-motion animated feature film The New Gulliver, but, again, was left uncredited.Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky. The Complete Works in 5 Volumes. Volume 1. ed. by Vadim Perelmuter. Saint Petersburg: Symposium, 2001, 688 pages. One of his last short stories, \\"Dymchaty bokal\\" (\\"The Smoke-Colored Goblet\\") from 1939, tells the story of a goblet miraculously never running out of wine, which is sometimes interpreted as a wry allusion to the author's fondness for alcohol. Krzhizhanovsky died in Moscow, but his burial place is not known. In 1976, scholar Vadim Perelmuter discovered Krzhizhanovsky's archive and in 1989 published one of his short stories. As the five volumes of his collected works followed, Krzhizhanovsky emerged from obscurity as a remarkable Soviet writer, who polished his prose to the verge of poetry. His short parables, written with an abundance of poetic detail and wonderful fertility of invention – though occasionally bordering on the whimsical – are sometimes compared to the ficciones of Jorge Luis Borges. \\"Quadraturin\\" (1926), the best known of such phantasmagoric stories, is a Kafkaesque tale in which allegory meets existentialism.

Biography She was born on 8 February 1890 in Málaga. The family emigrated to Madrid, where her beauty and that of her sister were welcomed. Painters Julio Romero de Torres and Ricardo Baroja asked that they model, but Anita refused being only 16. During the marriage ceremony of king Alfonso XIII of Spain in Madrid, Jagatjit Singh Sahib Bahadur, the Maharaja of the princely state of Kapurthala watched her performances in a cafe-concert. He seduced her and stayed with her throughout the wedding but left after the bombing of the royal couple (31 May 1906). Later, however, her friends Romero de Torres, Ramón María del Valle-Inclán and Pastora Imperio convinced her to further meet him in Paris. He had her educated (including in French) in order that he could explain his love for her. They married on 28 January 1908. After a Sikh marriage in India, she changed her name to Maharani Prem Kaur Sahiba. They later travelled in Europe and India, and she wrote a book about this time called \\"Impresiones de mis viajes a las Indias\\". She also gave the Maharaja a son, Maharajkumar Ajit Singh Sahib Bahadur (born 26 April 1908, educated at Cambridge University and at the Military Academy, Dehradun. Assistant to the Indian Trade Commissioner in Argentina, died in 1982). During the First World War, her husband worked in Franco-British hospitals. They separated after the Maharaja married his 7th wife and as a result, Delgado stayed in Paris living secretly with her secretary in order that her allowance continued. A ship carrying her jewels to France sank en route. The jewels are said to be worth millions. She died on 7 July 1962 in Madrid. In the media A movie on Anita's life titled La princesa de Kapurthala starring the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz was slated to begin shooting in 2006. However a descendant of Jagatjit Singh, Shatrujit Singh, has opposed the filming since he considers that Javier Moro's novel on which it is based distorts truth, especially the allegations of the Maharajah forcing Anita to an abortion.Las autoridades indias, contra Penélope Cruz.

They are native to still waters in Southeast Asia and are distributed worldwide via the aquarium trade. Croaking gouramis are capable of producing a \\"croaking\\" noise using their pectoral fins.  General  Croaking gouramis can reach an average size of about 5 centimeters, though some individuals can grow as large as 6 or 7 centimeters. Coloration is highly variable, ranging from pale brown and green to dark purple with black or red spots on the fins. 2-4 brown or black stripes or rows of spots are present on their sides. Median fins have a thin iridescent blue coloration on their edges. The iris of the eye is bright blue or purple. Females tend to be paler than males, have a slightly rounded dorsal fin and a shorter anal fin.Sterba, G (1983) Most croaking gouramis live for about 2 years but with proper care can live as long as 5 in an aquarium setting. They are native to stillwater habitats including ponds, canals and paddy fields in Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Malaya, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. A breeding population is known to exist in a series of drainage ditches in Palm Beach County, Florida, USA, almost certainly introduced there through the aquarium industry. As their name suggests, croaking gouramis are capable of producing an audible grunting or chirping noise, accomplished through the use of specialized adaptations of their pectoral fins.Ladich, F., et al. (1992) These noises are produced by both sexes during breeding displays and during the establishment of dominance hierarchies among males. A typical showdown between males consists of each fish circling the other, flaring fins, aggressively darting (though rarely making contact), and producing croaking noises. Well matched individuals may continue this behaviour for several hours at a time.  In aquaria  Croaking gouramis are fairly shy, peaceful fish that do well in most community aquaria and do not cause problems with other tankmates. Males can be fairly territorial and aggressive with each other during breeding periods, but will not cause harm given a large enough aquarium, and usually males comfortably coexist. They require a tank no smaller than 40 litres (10 US gallons), preferably larger, and each pair of males will need about 20 inches of space to feel comfortable with one another. Croaking gouramis will prowl about all areas of the aquarium, preferring to lurk among reeds and under large leaves close to the water surface. At night, they might be found \\"sleeping\\" at the bottom, even resting on the substrate (which is not normally a cause for concern), or hovering motionless at the water surface. Like all members of the suborder Anabantoidei, the croaking gourami can breathe atmospheric oxygen from above the water surface using a specialized labyrinth organ if necessary. It is important, therefore, that the surface of the water be exposed to fresh air, usually accomplished by keeping them in an open-top tank or using a hood that allows air ventilation. If the tank has good air pumps, this is not always needed, since the air pumps will refresh the air above the water. Very cold air temperatures at the water surface may lead to infections of the labyrinth organ. The aquarium should be heavily planted and have at least part of the surface shaded by broad leaves or floating plants. Croaking gouramis will become severely stressed in bare tanks without various hiding places. A darker substrate will make them feel comfortable and help show off their subtle colors. Like most gouramis, these fish are susceptible to diseases and infections, so regular water changes are a must. They are tolerant of fairly high temperatures. This can be used to eliminate fish diseases such as ich from the aquarium. Temperatures of 84 °F (29 °C) are easily tolerated though 26 °C seems to be close to optimal. A pH of 6.8 is about right and peat filtration is often recommended. Croaking gouramis should not be kept with large, aggressive fish, but are compatible with other small, peaceful fish as well as with fellow gouramis. They will be targeted by male Bettas so they should not be kept with them. They are very sensitive to noise and the tank should be in a quiet area.  Diet  In the wild, croaking gouramis are mostly insectivorous, feeding on insects and insect larvae, however other food types, such as zooplankton, crustaceans, shrimp meat and occasionally plant matter, are eaten as well. In aquaria, a varied diet is important to their long-term health; standard flake foods along with regular supplements of freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex worms, brine shrimp, and some algae-based flakes will provide these fish with proper nutrition. Occasional feedings of live brine shrimp offer the aquarist an opportunity to observe the natural hunting behaviour of croaking gouramis.  Breeding  Sex can be most reliably determined by candling but the more common approach is to observe the shape of the dorsal fin: the male's dorsal fin is pointed, while the female's is rounded. The male croaking gourami is a bubblenest builder, creating a small nest from air bubbles and mucous under a leaf. The water level should be reduced to 8 inches during spawning, circulation kept minimal, and the temperature should be approximately 28 °C (82 °F). Spawning occurs under the nest, with the female responding to the male's dance by rolling over, followed by the typical gourami embrace. About 5 to 10 eggs are released in a quick burst. The male will grab the eggs and spit them into the nest, often adding a few more bubbles for good measure. This act may be repeated a dozen times or more, until about 100 eggs are laid. Some large females may lay more than 200. After spawning the female should be moved to a different tank. The male will keep the bubblenest maintained and tend to the eggs and fry, but when the fry are 2–3 days old the male should also be removed. When first hatched, the fry should be fed infusoria, and later, baby brine shrimp and finely ground flakes. Freeze-dried tablets may also be fed to older fry. It is important that the breeding and grow-out tanks be covered and protected from cool drafts, as low air temperatures above the water surface may cause damage to the developing labyrinth organs of the young fish when they begin to take gulps of air.

Overview The actual sessions had taken place in June 1953, December 1954, and January 1955, and (as Prestige Records had yet to enter the 12-inch LP era) were first released on two 10-inch albums, entitled Modern Jazz Quartet (PRLP 160, 1953, whose second side contained \\"The Queen's Fancy\\", \\"Delauney's Dilemma\\", \\"Autumn In New York\\" and \\"But Not For Me\\") and The Modern Jazz Quartet, Vol. 2 (PRLP 170, 1955, containing \\"Django\\", \\"One Bass Hit\\", \\"Milano\\" and \\"La Ronde Suite\\"). The first session took place in New York, but the eventual Hackensack, New Jersey sessions were engineered by Rudy Van Gelder; the whole album was reissued in 2006 as part of the Rudy Van Gelder Remasters collection. \\"Django\\" (like the other original material on the album) was composed by the group's pianist and musical director, John Lewis. It is one of his best-known compositions, written in memory of the Belgian gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt. One other apostrophic tune is \\"Delauney's Dilemma\\", a jaunty tribute to the French jazz critic Charles Delaunay. The lengthy \\"La Ronde Suite\\", with discrete sections emphasizing each group member's contributions, is in fact a version of the standard \\"Two Bass Hit\\", written by Lewis for Dizzy Gillespie and recorded by, among others, Miles Davis on Milestones. Gillespie's own tune, \\"One Bass Hit\\", is also included as a feature for bassist Percy Heath. Vibraphonist Milt \\"Bags\\" Jackson can be heard grunting and humming throughout the quieter numbers, which include renditions of the Gershwins' \\"But Not For Me\\" and the Vernon Duke standard \\"Autumn In New York\\". Reception Writing for All About Jazz, Douglas Payne described Django as \\"classic jazz in construction and execution\\" and said it was \\"the place to begin appreciating the many and great virtues of one of jazz's finest aggregates\\".

It followed \\"Spitfire\\" (Professor Jenny Swensen) and a group of brilliant but eccentric college students as they used high-tech powered exoskeletons to combat the mysterious terrorist organization called The Club. Following the series' cancellation, Swensen was redesigned as the armor-skinned paranormal Chrome, and became a regular character in DP7. A different version of the character – Dr Jennifer Swann – was introduced in 2007 as part of Warren Ellis' newuniversal, a single-title reworking of the New Universe concepts. Publication history Spitfire and the Troubleshooters was created for the New Universe line by Eliot R. Brown and Jack Morelli. Brown recalls that it was Morelli who first came up with the idea of doing the series. On Spitfires conception, Brown commented, \\"It was more than Iron Girl, it was a different technological attitude, more reality- based. Iron Man was not unreal, but Iron Man as a concept did too much. Even in the 1980s, the suit was so smart, it could have gone off and had its own adventures. I tried to do something that was more of a garbage can with legs and a good brain in it, something more mechanical.\\" The concept of the Troubleshooters was based on a series of escapades Brown shared with a childhood friend, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while visiting him at the MIT campus in the mid-1970s. Brown and Morelli wanted to write Spitfire and the Troubleshooters themselves, going so far as to take reference photos of the MIT campus and petitioning for Herb Trimpe to be the series artist. However, when Brown approached Bob Harras to turn in the first half of the script for issue #1, he saw that Harras had already accepted a completed script from Gerry Conway. Issues #4 and 5 saw dramatic turns in the series plot, as Fritz Kroetze (originally marked as the main villain of the series) is killed off, and the Spitfire armor is destroyed, leaving protagonist Jenny Swensen an ordinary human. Conway remained the regular writer until issue #6, which he co-wrote with his replacement, Cary Bates. Bates immediately restructured the series, eliminating the Troubleshooters, taking away Swensen's vocation as a teacher, introducing a new supporting cast of government operatives, and generally replacing the concept of Spitfire and the Troubleshooters with a new espionage series, Codename: Spitfire. Issue #10 saw the completion of this metamorphosis, but was also the final issue of Bates's brief run. A single-issue stint by Fabian Nicieza saw Swensen don a new Spitfire armor, and the series closed out with two fill-in issues. Mediocre sales placed Codename: Spitfire among the four New Universe titles to be cancelled at the end of its first year. An eight-page Spitfire solo story was printed in February 2006 as a backup story in Amazing Fantasy #19 as part of the Untold Tales of the New Universe event, which was created to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the New Universe.

The Parable of the Unjust Steward or Parable of the Penitent Steward is a parable of Jesus which appears in . In it, a steward who is about to be fired curries favor with his master's debtors by remitting some of their debts. PassageInterpretation The parable, on the face of it, appears to be commending dishonest behaviour.Daryl Koehn, \\"Integrity as a Business Asset\\", Journal of Business Ethics, (2005) 58: 125–136 This issue is sometimes addressed by suggesting that the manager is forgoing a commission due to him personally,The Catholic Study Bible, Oxford University Press, 1990, footnote to Luke 16 v 1-8a but some scholars disagree with this interpretation. However, although the master has \\"a certain grudging admiration\\"John Phillips, Exploring the Gospel of Luke: An expository commentary, Kregel Publications, 2005, , pp. 216-217. for the manager's \\"shrewdness,\\" Jesus labels the manager \\"dishonest.\\" To add to the interpretations, several different sayings about money were attached to the parable here. A verbal thread or leitwortstil links the parable proper (Luke 16:1-8a) to the following sayings about wealth. For example, the word “dishonest” in Luke 16:8a reoccurs in 16:9 (“dishonest wealth”), in 16:10 (“dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much”), and in 16:11 (“dishonest wealth”).James L. Resseguie, Spiritual Landscape: Images of the Spiritual Life in the Gospel of Luke (Grand Rapids: MI, Baker Academic, 2004), 111. It is a matter of debate whether sayings about trust or serving two masters apply to this parable. The manager in the parable is probably a slave or freedman acting as his master's agent in business affairs.Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 590-595. As his master's representative, the agreements he signs with the debtors are therefore binding. The parable shares the theme of other passages where \\"Jesus counsels the disposition of possessions (and hospitality) on behalf of the poor with the understanding that, while mammon will vanish, eternal treasure will have thus been secured.\\" When death comes, \\"the power we have to do good with our money ceases, so we should do good with it now\\" so that the friends we have made on earth will be waiting for us in heaven. This interpretation was also espoused by early church writers, such as Asterius of Amasia: > When, therefore, any one anticipating his end and his removal to the next > world, lightens the burden of his sins by good deeds, either by canceling > the obligations of debtors, or by supplying the poor with abundance, by > giving what belongs to the Lord, he gains many friends, who will attest his > goodness before the Judge, and secure him by their testimony a place of > happiness.Asterius of Amasia, Sermon 2: The Unjust Steward, Sermons (1904) > pp. 45-71. English Reformer William Tyndale emphasises the consistency of this parable with the doctrine of justification by faith, writing a booklet on the parable called The Parable of the Wicked Mammon (1528),William Tyndale, The Parable of the Wicked Mammon (1528), also printed in The Works of the English reformers: William Tyndale and John Frith, Volume 1 (1831), pp. 83–161. based on an exposition by Martin Luther.Mike Pincombe and Cathy Shrank, The Oxford Handbook of Tudor Literature, Oxford University Press, 2009, , p. 109. Tyndale saw \\"good works\\" as the result of faith. Tyndale also pointed out that the steward was not praised by Jesus for his conduct, but merely provided as an example of wisdom and diligence, so that \\"we with righteousness should be as diligent to provide for our souls, as he with unrighteousness provided for his body.\\" Anglican Charles Daubuz (1720) was among those who saw in the \\"eternal habitations\\" promised to the unjust steward a negative prediction of the grave, not a promise of heaven.Daubuz A Perpetual Commentary on the Revelation of St. John 1720 \\"Everlasting Habitations, is an euphemismus of the oriental stamp, to signify the Grave, or State of the Dead, .\\" The Anglican theologian J. C. Ryle, writing in 1859, rejected a number of allegorical interpretations of the parable, and gave an interpretation similar to that of Tyndale: > Let us contend earnestly for the glorious doctrines of salvation by grace, > and justification by faith. But let us never allow ourselves to suppose that > true religion sanctions any trifling with the second table of the law. Let > us never forget for a moment, that true faith will always be known by its > fruits. We may be very sure that where there is no honesty, there is no > grace.J. C. Ryle, Expository thoughts on the Gospels, with the text > complete, London: Wertheim, Macintosh, and Hunt, 1859, p. 199. David Flusser, in a book titled Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls, has taken the phrase \\"sons of light\\" to mean the Essenes; their closed economic system is contrasted with that of other people who were less strict. A Confessional Lutheran apologist commented: > Jesus' parable of the unjust manager is one of the most striking in all the > Gospels. Obviously, it would be pressing the parable beyond the point of > comparison to interpret it as an endorsement of dishonest business > practices. Jesus' point is simply to show us what money is really for. > Typically we think of ourselves first when we answer that question. But > Jesus invites us to realize that, first, our money isn't really ours -- > we're simply managing it for its real owner, God. Second, even \\"filthy > lucre\\" can be pressed into the service of God and our neighbor. When it is, > the benefits will last beyond this life -- which the things we buy for > ourselves won't. For example, money can be used to spread the Gospel, > through which the Holy Spirit will gather believers into Christ's church. We > will enjoy blessed fellowship with these believers forever, long after the > money itself is gone.WELS Topical Q&A;: Luke 16:9 - Welcomed Into Eternal > Dwellings '' Catholic interpretation According to the commentators of the New American Bible Revised Edition, the parable is about an agent who, knowing he is about to be fired for usury, repents of his sin, asking the debtors to only pay what they owe his master -- rather than pay him as well.USCCB Bible, Luke 16:1-8 commentary The parable of the dishonest steward has to be understood in the light of the Palestinian custom of agents acting on behalf of their masters and the usurious practices common to such agents. The dishonesty of the steward consisted in the squandering of his master’s property (Lk 16:1) and not in any subsequent graft. The master commends the dishonest steward who has forgone his own usurious commission on the business transaction by having the debtors write new notes that reflected only the real amount owed the master (i.e., minus the steward’s profit). The dishonest steward acts in this way in order to ingratiate himself with the debtors because he knows he is being dismissed from his position (Lk 16:3). The parable, then, teaches the prudent use of one’s material goods in light of an imminent crisis. This is in line with what John the Baptist tells the tax collectors and soldiers about exploiting tax payers and debtors earlier in the gospel.USCCB Bible, Luke 3:12-14 Even tax collectors came to be baptized and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” He answered them, “Stop collecting more than what is prescribed.” Soldiers also asked him, “And what is it that we should do?” He told them, “Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages.” See also * Life of Jesus in the New Testament * Luke 16 * Ministry of Jesus ReferencesExternal links *Biblical Art on the WWW: The Shrewd Manager Unjust Steward, Parable of the Category:Gospel of Luke ","title":"Parable of the Unjust Steward"},{"id":"4466739","text":"Lillian Riemer BeVier (born June 11, 1939) is a professor of law at the University of Virginia School of Law.

Background The band began as a solo recording project of singer/songwriter Andy Gonzales, who first recorded as Marshmallow Coast in 1996 with a self-released cassette, which featured contributions from Joel Richardson of The Minders. After a split single release, Gonzales met up with old friend and Neutral Milk Hotel member Julian Koster to record Timesquare. While it was recorded in 1997, it did not get released until 2000 due to various label disputes. Gonzales, after releasing some more singles, dropped the Marshmallow Coast project temporarily to tour with Music Tapes, Koster's side project, and relocate to Athens, GA in 1997. In Athens, Gonzales met with Kevin Barnes and Derek Almstead, singer/songwriter and bassist/ engineer, respectively, of the relatively new Of Montreal. With Barnes, Gonzales recorded Marshmallow Coast's second album, 1999's Seniors & Juniors, and became a member of Of Montreal himself. The other members of the band became his backing band for a couple singles including the split with Of Montreal and with My First Keyboard. 2000 brought the Derek Almstead produced Marshmallow Coasting, and a tour with Of Montreal. Gonzales then began a website-based project where he recorded songs for paying customers and gave them sole ownership. Derek and Andy's second collaboration Ride the Lightning was released in 2001 with another Of Montreal tour. Antistar released in 2003 without Derek or any other Of Montrealers and with the addition of Sara Kirkpatrick on flute, was produced by Jason NeSmith of Casper & the Cookies. In late 2005, Gonzales announced that the project would show some changes, songwriting duties now being shared between Gonzales and Almstead. With the additions of Emily Growden on keys/vocal and Carlton Owens on drums, a full band was formed and the name changed to M Coast. A new album entitled Say It in Slang was released on Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records in October 2006. In November 2007 it was announced that M Coast had parted ways. Andy has reverted to the name Marshmallow Coast again, while Derek, Emily, and Carlton are working on a new band called Faster Circuits. May 2009 heralds the return to the Marshmallow Coast name with the release of Phreak Phantasy on HHBTM. Seniors and Juniors Strikes Back was released on HHBTM in March 2011. The album, originally released in 1999, was re-recorded in the same style as their previous album, Phreak Phantasy, and contains a few new tracks.

Geography Bidor is located between Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur via the North–South Expressway. It is south of Tapah, north of Sungkai, east of Changkat Jong and Teluk Intan and west of the Titiwangsa Mountains. History An 8th–9th century bronze standing 8-armed Buddhist Avalokitesvara statue found at Anglo Oriental, Bidor, Perak tin mine in year 1936. 79 cm height. Bidor used to be part of the Gangga Negara kingdom based on the historical artifacts that were discovered. It is believed that the area accepted Hindu-Buddhism around 900 years ago. The pioneer of the town was believed to be Syeikh Abdul Ghani who also became the village headman after the founding of the settlements. Bidor was believed to have existed as a small village by the bank of Bidor River in the late 18th century. Local villagers transported goods using their sampans (boats) to neighbouring villages along the river towards Teluk Intan in Hilir Perak district. Following the tin-mining boom in Perak, there was an influx of Chinese immigrants to Perak as a whole, including Bidor. The Hoklo (Hokkien- speaking) Chinese was believed to have originated from Teluk Intan. The influx of the Hakka and Cantonese came from Kinta Valley and Hulu Selangor. They came to Batang Padang to flee the local civil wars and Chinese triad wars.  World War II  Bidor was closely connected to the Battle of Kampar during the Japanese advancement southwards towards Kuala Lumpur. On 29 December 1941, 501 Battery withdrew to Bidor fleeing Kampar. The column was again dive-bombed and machine-gunned just south of Dipang. Five men were wounded. The last entry in the 137 Regt War Diary was for 31 December 1941, Lt Hartley's 30th birthday, when his battery and the other two of 137 Regt were all in the Bikam-Sungkai area. In 1943, MPAJA's MPAJA 1st Patrol under the 5th Regiment was assigned to protect Col. John Davis who represent the Supreme Allied Commander, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, who had just established the Head Office (HO) of Force 136http://www.asiawind.com/forums/read.php?f=1&i;=10174&t;=10174 at Blantan Hill, some seven miles north-east of Bidor township. 1st Patrol was commanded by Huang Song (黃松) and his deputy Cai Dadi (蔡大地).  Communist Insurgency  Members of the Senoi Praaq in 1953 Captain D.G. Lock was killed while bathing near Bidor on 2 October 1948 (att. K.O.Y.L.I.). Captain A.R.

GHQ 26th Gurkha Infantry Brigade and the Royal Artillery's 95 Independent Field Battery (comprising \\"Charlie Troop\\" \\"Dog Troop\\" and \\"Command Troop\\") was stationed in Bidor in the 1950s to quell communist insurgency. After Malaya gained independence, Bidor was under the command of the local Royal Malaysian Police 3rd Battalion General Operations Forces (formally known as Police Field Force) who was stationed locally. This unit is famous with its elite Senoi Praaq unit; a special unit consists of Orang Asli (indigenous tribe) expert in tracking. The last 'black area' in Bidor, the Gepai Falls was finally opened to public in 1989 after a treaty was signed between Malaysian government and the Malayan Communist Party. Economy Bidor is a mainly industrial area. When one travels north of Bidor, one will see miles and miles of plantation on both side of the trunk road covered with lush greenery, guava, oil palm and rubber plantations. An important source of income for the town, though, is (or used to be) from travellers who stop by the town for its well-known local delicacies and agricultural products. Before the advent of North–South Expressway, travellers had no choice but to pass through this town through the federal trunk road. As this town is (still is) rather famous for its variety of food, travellers frequently choose to stop-by at one of the eateries before continuing their journey. Kaolinite (kaolin), a type of clay was widely exploited in Bidorhttp://www.mymalaysia.net.my/Natural_Environment/p2_articleid/6 Food The most famous food undoubtedly will be the duck-thigh-noodle available at one of the eatery that is the famous Pun Chun. The restaurant is located on the main street. Pun Chun is also famous for its 'Sat Kai Ma' (Chinese: 萨奇马) – a type of sweet dessert and also 'Kai Jai Peng' (Chinese：鸡仔饼) which is the chicken biscuit.

He ran as an independent candidate for the Presidency of the Maldives, and placed third of six candidates. Saeed was appointed as the Attorney-General by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on 11 November 2003 at the age of 33. He is a scholar on Islam and wrote about liberal Islam in his book Freedom of Religion, Apostasy, and Islam published in 2004. Education Educated in International Islamic University Malaysia before earning his Ph.D. at the University of Queensland in Australia, Saeed served as the Chief Justice of the Criminal Court before being appointed as Attorney-General. Political career=New Maldives Trio A leading member of the New Maldives faction of the governing Maldivian People's Party (DRP), Saeed was elected as the Vice President of DRP in April 2006. The same month he also co-founded with Dr. Ahmed Shaheed, a fellow graduate of the University of Queensland and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mohamed Jameel Ahmed. Saeed was thrust into the limelight as President Gayoom began a new term of office committed to a rapid overhaul of the country's archaic governance system and legal framework, shortly after riots rocked the capital in the aftermath of the killing of four persons in prison, discrediting the country's archaic penal and legal system. Saeed supported a reform agenda proposed by President Gayoom. He proposed a 5-year plan to reform the criminal justice system, beginning 2005, to overhaul the nation's legal framework, penal system and the judiciary. He tabled a new Penal Code before the parliament. Together with Foreign Minister Shaheed and the Information Minister Mohamed Nasheed (not Mohamed Nasheed), Saeed is also the chief architect of the alleged Road map for the Reform Agenda published in March 2006 by President Gayoom regime. With the defected faction After 4 and half years in the cabinet the then Attorney General Saeed and Justice Minister Mohamed Jameel Ahmed resigned from the government in what was viewed as a setback for the reformist credentials of President Gayoom. The resignations were submitted at August 5, 2007, 2:30 pm, and Saeed and Jameel arrived at Daabaurgue for a press conference just after 3:30 pm. Accusing Gayoom of misdeeds, Hassan Saeed said “I have resigned because the reform agenda, which I joined the government for, has failed, and it is not appropriate for me to stay in the cabinet.” Following his resignation from the Cabinet, Saeed, along with former Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed and former Justice Minister Mohmamed Jameel Ahmed has set up a corporate and business law firm called \\"Raajje Chambers\\". Presidential Bid Gayoom's defected New Maldives trio with Hassan Saeed as the front runner contended for 2008 Maldives Presidential Election as an independent candidate, Hassan Saeed as the presidential candidate chose Ahmed Shaheed as his running mate.. Minivan News He came third behind the incumbent President Gayyoom and Mr. Nasheed, Maldivian Democratic Party Candidate. With Saeed's backing in the second of election, Mr Nasheed was able to bring to an end of the 30 year rule of Gayyoom. Islam A madrasa student and Islamic Scholar, Saeed is an advocate of liberal Islam and is the co-author of the book Freedom of Religion, Apostasy and Islam, a book that elucidates the position of Muslim scholars on apostasy and practice prevailing in the Muslim community. In the book the authors Abdullah Saeed and Hassan Saeed argue that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law conflicts with a variety of fundamentals of Islam. They contend that the early development of the law of apostasy was essentially a religio-political tool, and that there was a large diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment. Saeed has argued in the newspaper Indian Express that Islamic anger over the U.S. invasion of Iraq, along with increasing Internet access to the Maldives, has caused a shift towards greater fundamentalism. Saeed is also a Barrister-at-Law in the High Court of Australia. He is also an Advocate and Solicitor in the Republic of Maldives. He has written editorials in the British newspaper The Guardian advocating democracy in the Maldives.

Jonas (b. 1932) was born in Montreal and graduated from McGill University with a bachelor's degree in Metallurgical Engineering in 1954. He later attended Cambridge University on an Athlone Fellowship and received a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Sciences in 1960. On returning to Montreal, he began teaching \\"mechanical metallurgy\\" at McGill and built up a research laboratory that includes a number of specialized testing machines and is particularly well equipped for experimental investigations in the field of high temperature deformation. Dr. Jonas is known internationally for the ground breaking studies that he and his students and colleagues have carried out at McGill on the hot rolling behaviour of metals. Their work has resulted in major improvements in the understanding of the softening processes involved in steel processing; these have led to more accurate computer models for the control of industrial rolling mills. They have published over eight hundred technical papers dealing with the scientific and engineering aspects of metal shaping and forming. They have received numerous awards for this work, including the Réaumur and Gold Medals of the French Metallurgical Society, the Hatchett Medal of the Metals Society (U.K.), the Airey, Dofasco and Alcan Awards of the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Gold Medal of the Canadian Metal Physics Association, the NSERC Award of Excellence, the Canada Council Killam Award, the Michael Tenenbaum Award of the American Institute of Metallurgical Engineers, the Hunt Silver Medal of the US Iron and Steel Society, the Barrett Silver Medal and G.

Frederick the Great had it built, about seven hundred metres southwest of the Sanssouci Summer Palace, to adorn his flower and vegetable garden. The garden architect was Johann Gottfried Büring, who between 1755 and 1764 designed the pavilion in the then- popular style of Chinoiserie, a mixture of ornamental rococo elements and parts of Chinese architecture. The unusually long building time of nine years is attributed to the Seven Years' War, during which Prussia's economic and financial situation suffered significantly. Only after the end of the war in 1763 were the chambers inside the pavilion furnished. As the building served not only as a decorative piece of garden architecture but also as a setting for small social events, Frederick the Great ordered the building of a Chinese Kitchen, a few metres south-east of the Chinese House. After a conversion in 1789, only the hexagonal windows show the Oriental character of the former outbuilding. A few years later, the Dragon House was built in the form of a Chinese pagoda on the northern edge of Sanssouci Park bordering Klausberg. The building was Frederick the Great's attempt to follow the Chinese fashion of the 18th century, which began in France before spreading to England, Germany, and Russia. The former Chinese Kitchen following its conversion  Chinoiserie  In the 17th century, Dutch traders brought Chinese mother-of-pearl, lacquer, silks and porcelain to Europe. In the noble courts of the baroque era, an interest in Oriental arts grew during the rococo period into Chinoiserie, a genuine fashion for all things Chinese. In addition to the enthusiasm for Asian luxury goods which harmonized with the certain forms of rococo, travelogues and exhibitions portrayed the carefree living of the Chinese, which corresponded with the European courts' ideal of a relaxed lifestyle. Whole rooms of palaces were decorated with porcelain, small Chinese-style furniture and wall murals which presented the ideal world that was supposedly China.  Architecture  Frederick the Great modeled the Chinese House on the Maison du trefle, a 1738 garden pavilion in the palace grounds of Lunéville, France. This trefoil-shaped building was created by the French architect Emmanuel Héré de Corny for the Duke of Lorraine, Stanisław Leszczyński, former King of Poland, who lived in exile in France. An exemplar of one of the etchings of the Maison published by Héré in 1753 was in the possession of Frederick the Great.  Outer design  Northern entrance to the Chinese House The Chinese House has the shape of a trefoil. The rounded central building contains three cabinet rooms regularly interspersed with free spaces. Rounded windows and French windows that reach almost to the ground let light into the pavilion's interior. The rolling tented copper ceiling is supported in the free space by four gilded sandstone columns, the work of the Swiss ornamental sculptor Johann Melchior Kambly, who was in the employ of Frederick the Great from 1746. The gilded sandstone sculptures that sit at the feet of the columns and stand at the walls of the rooms originate from the workshops of the sculptors Johann Gottlieb Heymüller (ca. 1715-1763) and Johann Peter Benckert (1709-1769). People from the area stood as models for the eating, drinking and music-making Chinese figures, which explains the statues' European features. The cupola crowning the roof is surmounted by a gilded Chinese figure with an open parasol. Friedrich Jury created it in copper after a design by the sculptor Benjamin Giese. Light falls into the central chamber through the long oval window openings of the cupola as it does through the windows in the façade.  Interior design  The wall of the circular central chamber, accessible by the north side, is coated with stucco marble. Monkeys with musical instruments worked in stucco over the French windows, brackets holding porcelain and wall sconces between the windows are all coated with gold leaf. Likewise coated is a richly decorated chandelier which hangs from the cupola. The ceiling painting on the higher circuit of the room is the work of Thomas Huber, dating from 1756. Huber also painted the ceilings of the empty chambers on the exterior surface. The plans of the French artist Blaise Nicholas Le Sueur, who taught as an art master at the Berlin Academy of Arts, served as a model for the interior. The ceiling paintings show Oriental men behind a balustrade, some looking into the room, others chatting with one another. They are surrounded by parrots, monkeys and Buddhas sitting on posts. The walls between the central room and the adjoining chambers are decorated with brightly coloured, silken wall coverings painted with floral patterns, at the time a desired and valuable wall textile known as \\"Pekings\\". As may be seen here, Frederick the Great preferred to use for the interiors of his buildings only the highest quality materials manufactured by Prussian silk factories. Small fragments of this wall covering were used as a model for the reconstruction of the original during a restoration of 1990-1993\\\\.

While heading north-northwestward, the depression steadily intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August 1\\\\. After intensifying slightly further, Chantal made landfall near High Island, Texas later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall. Early on August 2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August 4\\\\. While making landfall in Texas, the storm produced relatively small tides, with most locations reporting waves less than in height. However, some locations experienced extensive beach erosion. In addition, there were numerous rescues made by the U.S. Coast Guard. Due to both rainfall and high winds at least 3,000 homes were damaged, and numerous trees and sign were knocked down. Two tornadoes were reported, with one causing the destruction of a shed in Crystal Beach, Texas, and the other knocking over several trees and mobile homes in Iota, Louisiana. Elsewhere, Chantal and its remnants brought light to moderate rainfall to several other states, although affects were minor in other states. Overall, 13 fatalities occurred, all of which due to drowning, and at least $100 million (1989 USD) in damage was reported. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Chantal can be tracked back to a tropical disturbance within the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Trinidad and Tobago on July 24\\\\. The system crossed westward over the Caribbean Sea, and there were no signs of organization until July 27 near the coast of Honduras. Despite the predictions for slow development from the tropical weather outlooks, it was possible that the system developed a surface low center near Belize City, Belize late on July 28\\\\. After the system moved inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, it became disorganized, although the National Hurricane Center indicated in the tropical weather outlook that once it moved into the Gulf of Mexico there was potential for development. Although the outflow of the system had appeared impressive on satellite images, the potential for development seemed uncertain, mostly due to the close proximity to land. The storm quickly became better organized based on satellite data and ship reports. Tropical Storm Chantal on July 31 Almost immediately after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July 30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore of the north coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80 miles (129 km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed. The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575 miles (920 km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal. Although it became a tropical storm early that morning, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50 mph (85 km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5 to 3.5 within twelve hours using the Dvorak technique. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11 mph (18 km/h) due to weak ridging over Florida. Later on July 31, satellite imagery revealed better organization, and another reconnaissance flight found winds at 91 mph (151 km/h) while flying at 1500 feet (457 m). Based on these observations, it was estimated that Chantal had intensified into a hurricane early on August 1\\\\. Hurricane Chantal continued to intensify, slightly, and attained its peak intensity on August 1 at 1000 UTC, reaching maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Only three hours thereafter, Hurricane Chantal made landfall near High Island, Texas with winds still at 80 mph (130 km/h). Chantal rapidly weakened to a tropical storm at 1800 UTC on August 2, just five hours after landfall, and quickly degenerated to a tropical depression early on August 2\\\\. Tropical Depression continued its course and eventually dissipated over western Oklahoma on August 3\\\\. The remnants of Chantal then moved northward over the Great Plains and was tracked northward over New York, eventually reaching New England and Newfoundland just before Hurricane Dean approached. Preparations At 0000 UTC on July 31, a tropical storm watch - indicating tropical storm force winds were possible within 48 hours - was issued from Port O'Connor, Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River. Three hours thereafter, a hurricane warning - signifying that hurricane-force winds were likely in 24 hours or less - was issued from Freeport, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana. A tropical storm warning was simultaneously put into effect from Port O'Connor, Texas to Mobile, Alabama, significantly overlapping the existing hurricane warning. The tropical storm warning was discontinued at 1000 UTC on August 1\\\\. Six hours later, the hurricane warning issued at 0300 UTC on July 31 was downgraded to a tropical storm warning, before the portion from Port Arthur, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana was canceled. The remaining portion from Freeport to Port O'Connor, Texas was discontinued at 0100 UTC on August 2. In addition to the tropical cyclone watches and warnings, several other actions were taken as Chantal approached. More than 600 oil workers were moved inland, though a man drowned while attempting to evacuate a rig south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Mayor of Port Arthur Malcolm Grant asked 800 residents to evacuate Sabine Pass, due to potential coastal flooding isolating the area. Shelters were opened at various schools in Port Arthur and Beaumont. In nearby Orange, crews at emergency centers distributed sand bags. About 8,500 residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana evacuated, with at least 67 people taking shelter at a school in Lake Charles. An additional 2,500 people fled Grand Isle, as the threat of the only road to the island flooding loomed. Impact Texas bore the brunt of the storm, where strong winds and heavy rainfall damaged about 3,000 homes and knocked downed numerous trees and signs. Chantal also spawned two tornadoes, one in Crystal Beach, Texas and the other in Acadia Parish, Louisiana; both of which caused minor damage. Additionally, 13 fatalities occurred, all of them due to drowning; 11 deaths occurred offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, while the remaining two were reported in east-central Texas. Overall, the storm resulted in at least $100 million (1989 USD) in damage. Mexico Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, the precursor tropical disturbance dropped rainfall on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The precipitation put out fires burning in the region, which had destroyed up to of jungle in the two months prior to the tropical disturbance, according to the Agriculture Department of Mexico. Texas Rainfall totals in the United States associated with Hurricane Chantal =Galveston County= The worst effects from the storm occurred in Galveston County. Waves of 7 feet (2 m) in height were reported on High Island during Chantal, while Kemah measured tides of 3.8 feet (1.1 m), and the Galveston Flagship pier reported 3.5 feet (1 m) seas. The high tides eroded more than of Texas State Highway 87, while at least another of that highway was covered in sand and debris. As a result, the highway was expected to be closed for at least five weeks, though in October 1989, storm surge from Hurricane Jerry caused more erosion, and no repairs have been made since. In the northern portions of Galveston County, rainfall was generally at least , which a peak of in Friendswood. Numerous streets in League City, Dickinson, and Friendswood were flooded for more than 24 hours. At least 100 homes in Friendswood were flooded, while water entered 70% of houses in Dickinson. Severe street flooding and ponding occurred in Galveston, especially in the low-lying areas; some homes and businesses were damaged, as a result. Overall, 500 homes in the county were flooded. Strong winds also effected the county, with the highest recorded sustained wind speed being in Galveston; the highest gust of was reported at the same location. At the National Weather Service Office in Downtown Galveston, sustained winds were and gusts reached . Although winds were strong, associated losses was confined to roof damage at beach homes in Gilchrist and High Island. In addition to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and high tides, the storm also produced one tornado in the county. Rated as an F0 on the Fujita scale, the tornado was spawned in Crystal Beach, where it destroyed a boat shed; elsewhere, no damage occurred from this twister. =Harris County= Rainfall produced by Chantal in the city of Houston alone varied extensively, with 7.14 inches (181 mm) at William P. Hobby Airport after twenty-four hours, and only 1.21 inches (31 mm) at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (then known as Houston Intercontinental Airport) in the same time lapse. In the southern portions of Harris County, rainfall totaled ranged from . Significant amounts of precipitation resulted in flooding, which in turn, caused several hundred emergency crew rescues and damage to at least 500 homes. Strong winds also caused significant effects in the county. In La Porte, where winds gusted to , 40 trees were toppled at a golf course, while a plane was flipped over at the La Porte Municipal Airport. The roof of a mobile home was torn off and a fence and a portable building was destroyed in Highlands. Winds damaged a red cross shelter in Pasadena and blew out several windows at a hospital in Baytown. Throughout the county, high winds destroyed 2 mobile homes and damaged 49 apartments and 24 businesses. =Elsewhere in Texas= Heavy rainfall affected Brazoria County, where precipitation amounts up to were reported; this caused significant flooding, especially in Pearland and Manvel. During the height of the storm, the entire town of Manvel was inundated with water, causing flood damage to at least 100 homes. Additionally, high winds in combination with floods damaged about 500 homes throughout the county. In Chambers County high winds caused two injuries and tore roofing material off of homes and mobile homes; about 100 homes were effected in the area. of rain fell in the southern portions of the county, causing minor flooding. Between of precipitation was recorded in eastern Fort Bend County. In the city of Fresno, at least 60 homes were flooded and several families were evacuated. After of rain fell in Richmond, local flooding occurred. Several mobile homes in the county also suffered wind damage. In Brazos County, heavy rainfall caused street flooding in College Station. Precipitation in Collin County reached as high as in Clear Lake, though no flood damage was reported. Additionally, two fatalities occurred when two teenage boys were riding a rubber raft, swept into a drainpipe, and subsequently drowned. The highest sustained wind speed recorded in Jefferson County was at Sea Rim State Park, while the strongest gust was at the Jack Brooks Regional Airport. Winds downed trees and limbs, while also causing minor roof damage. Tides at Sabine Pass were about about mean sea level; some beach erosion was reported near that location. In Liberty County, winds felled tree limbs, which damaged vehicles and portable buildings. Elsewhere One fatality was reported during an oil rig evacuation in the Gulf of Mexico. Ten other people perished when a lifeboat capsized south of Morgan City, Louisiana. Four others on the boat were rescued by the United States Coast Guard. In Louisiana, high tides were only reported at one location, with seas reaching about in Cameron. Winds in the state were also light, with the highest sustained wind speed being along the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, while the strongest gust was approximately in New Orleans. Rainfall was mostly minimal throughout the state and mainly less than , while the highest total recorded as in Amite City. A tornado touched down in Acadia Parish, where it downed trees and removed a mobile home from its foundation. The only known impact in Mississippi was tides of above mean sea level. Further north in the Midwestern United States, impact was generally minor. Chantal and its remnants dropped mostly light rainfall in the states of Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Only two of those states - Illinois and Michigan - recorded more than of precipitation. In Illinois, rainfall in Chicago flooded numerous streets and basements; Lake Shore Drive and Edens Expressway were briefly closed, as a result. Outside Chicago, minor flooding also occurred along a few creeks and low-lying areas. The rainfall rate of per hour in Grand Rapids, Michigan caused the release of about 40 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Grand River. Despite crossing through Ontario and New York, it is unknown if any impact occurred in those two locations. In Vermont, the remnants of Chantal dropped rainfall in excess of along the Caledonia, Orange, and Washington county lines. Bridges were knocked down, cars and homes were swept away, and crops were destroyed in the resultant flash floods.

From September 1935 their new models displayed a new name SS Jaguar. By then its business, founded in 1922, was run by and largely owned by William Lyons. Lyons had been partner with 1922 co-founder William Walmsley until Walmsley sold his shareholding in January 1935. The company that owned the business, S. S. Cars Limited, S. S.

The Times, Thursday, 10 January 1935; pg. 16; Issue 46958 S. S. Cars Limited changed its name to Jaguar Cars Limited 23 March 1945. S. S. There is doubt about the source of the SS name. Sir John Black of Standard-Triumph when asked said SS stood for Standard Swallow. William Lyons when asked was noncommittal, but he was at the time in the company of suppliers of chassis for his run of the mill production bodies. He concurred after the use of Standard chassis became exclusive. The Swallow Sidecar Company, trading name for the company Walmsley & Lyons co-founded by William Lyons and William Walmsley, progressively developed into a coachbuilder from its 1922 start, first making stylish sidecars for motorcycles. In May 1927, Swallow advertised that it would make 2-seater bodies on Austin and Morris chassis and running gear supplied through any authorised dealer. Their first full page advertisement appeared in the Autocar magazine in October 1927 to fit with the Olympia Motor Show. The next year Swallow relocated to the heart of the British motor industry. In the winter of 1928-1929 they moved bit by bit from Cocker Street Blackpool to a disused munitions factory on a rutted track, the future Swallow Road, off Holbrook Lane, Foleshill, Coventry. They returned to Blackpool each year for the Works Day Out. SS 1 built 1933. It has the production running boards and conventional wings interior door interior In 1929 John Black of Standard Motor Company and William Lyons teamed up to realise their long standing dream to produce a one of a kind sports car. This \\"First SS\\" was a sleek boat-tail open 2-seater. Its flowing design and streamlining pointed to an obvious attempt at making a fast car, possibly with the intention of venturing into racing. This car is believed to have been shipped to Australia in the late 1940s. While the initial link with John Black's Standard was slowly developed, bodies continued to be built on Austin, Standard, Fiat and lastly Wolseley Hornet chassis. Nevertheless, at Motor Show time in October 1931, Swallow eventually launched a car of its own, the SS 1, and displayed a prototype, all while the aforementioned little Wolseley Hornet Special continued alongside. \\"This car has its little knot of admirers around it every minute of the day, and from the point of view of general interest it is the most serious rival to the Rover Scarab. It is made by the Swallow Coachbuilding people on a chassis specially built for them by Standard, and featuring a six-cylinder side-valve engine of 15hp. But it is the body that is the big attraction. Its long low lines with no running boards and the head only a matter of four feet above the ground create an impression of speed and gracefulness which is quite worthy of comparison with the Lagondas and Delages. It is with a distinct shock that one notices the price is only £310. The radiator is quite different from the ordinary Standard type being specially designed to conform with the body lines and fitted with a chromium plated fluted front. It is set off with a futuristic emblem and the filler cap is tucked out of sight under the bonnet. The Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels are racing type, the wheel base being 9 ft 4 in and the track 4 ft 1 in The coachbuilt body has a sliding roof of new design with leather-grained head and large travelling trunk at the rear. The cycle type wings are deeply domed the side valances being very deep so that the necessity for running boards is obviated The interior of the car is beautifully finished, the cabinet work being done in very atrractive highly polished sycamore grained to resemble the back of a fiddle. The upholstery is in furniture hide The particular model shown is finished in apple green and black and is a beauty in every sense of the term.\\"Success of the Scottish Motor Show, The big attractions in the Kelvin Hall. page 10. The Courier and Advertiser, Dundee, Wednesday 18 November 1931 SS 1 and SS 2 SS 1 tourer 1935 Under the guidance of the chairman, William Lyons, the company survived the depression years of the 1930s by making a series of beautifully styled cars offering exceptional value for money although some enthusiasts criticised them at the time for being \\"more show than go\\". The engines and chassis supplied by the Standard Motor Company were fitted with Swallow bodies styled under Lyons supervision. The first of the SS range of cars available to the public was the 1932 SS 1 with 2-litre or 2½-litre side-valve, six-cylinder engine and the SS 2 with a four- cylinder 1-litre side-valve engine. Initially available as coupé or tourer a saloon was added in 1934, when the chassis was modified to be 2 inches (50 mm) wider. SS 90 SS 90 Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2008 The first of the open two-seater sports cars came in March 1935 with the SS 90, so called because of its claimed top speed. This car used the 2½-litre side-valve, six-cylinder engine in a short- chassis \\"cut and shut\\" SS 1 brought down to an SS 2's wheelbase, only 23 were made. Harry Weslake was set to work on engine development. Bill Heynes came to be chief engineer from Hillman — before that Humber. Weslake's new cylinder head was manufactured for SS by Standard. The Weslake head and twin RAG carburetters were fitted to the last year's production of SS 1 and SS 2 cars. Famous name=Four-door sports saloons and drophead coupés Advertisement 1936 image is of a 2½ litre car To counteract the \\"more show than go\\" criticism of their SS90 Lyons had engaged William Heynes as chief engineer and Harry Weslake for engine tuning. Weslake was asked to redesign the 2½-litre 70 bhp side-valve engine to achieve 90 bhp. His answer was an overhead-valve design that produced 102 bhp and it was this engine that launched the new SS Jaguar sports and saloon cars in 1936. The SS Jaguar 2½-litre saloon with its 102 bhp six-cylinder Weslake-designed cross-flow ohv cylinder head on its Standard engine caused a sensation when it was launched at a trade luncheon for dealers and press at London's Mayfair Hotel on 21 September 1935. The show car was in fact a prototype. Luncheon guests were asked to write down the UK price for which they thought the car would be sold and the average of their answers was £765. Even in that deflationary period, the actual price at just £395 would have been a pleasant surprise for many customers. Also available was a similar looking but scaled-down version using a 1½-litre four-cylinder side-valve engine. The Motor magazine in its announcement issue of 24 September 1935 referred to the SS Jaguar's distinguished appearance, outstanding performance and attractive price. With its new 2½-litre engine it could now compete with Kimber's heavily influenced by Morris but brand new MG SA. Extract from the speech of chairman and managing director Mr W Lyons to the shareholders Friday 11 October 1935 \\"This new car, which is called the Jaguar and has received a most enthusiastic reception from the whole of the trade and public has been produced to an ideal. It has fulfilled all our most optimistic anticipations, for it was intended to produce a car of extremely high quality and performance, hitherto associated with only the most exclusive type of car, at a moderate price.\\"Company Meeting.

Steel In 1938 saloon and drophead production moved from coachbuilt (wood framed) to all steel and a 3½-litre engine was added to the range. The 2½-litre and 3½-litre cars shared the same chassis and body design although it was necessary to use a wider radiator for the 3½-litre. The new 1½-litre for 1938 used the same body shell as the six-cylinder cars but on a shorter chassis and its new larger 1776 cc engine had overhead valves.

He won many international tournaments in Eastern Europe during his career, and tied for the Soviet Championship title in 1963, but lost the playoff. Kholmov was not well known in the West, since he never competed there during his career peak, being confined to events in socialist countries. His chess results were impressive, so this may have been for security reasons, as Kholmov had been a wartime sailor. But he was one of the strongest Soviet players from the mid-1950s well into the 1970s, and was ranked as high as No. 8 in the world by Chessmetrics.com from August 1960 to March 1961. Kholmov stayed active in competitive chess right to the end of his life, and maintained a high standard.  Early years  Kholmov learned chess at age 12, and was near Master strength within three years. He served as a sailor in the Soviet merchant marine during World War II, sailing mainly the Northern Arctic route. In 1945, he took 5th in Tula. In 1946, he won in Zhdanovichi (Belarus). In 1947, he took 4th in the 13th Belarusian championship. Later that year, he made his first high-level appearance at the Mikhail Chigorin Memorial, Moscow 1947, scoring 5½/15 against a powerful international field. In 1948, Kholmov won the next BLR-ch in 1948, unbeaten, with 11½/13. Kholmov qualified for his first Soviet final in 1948, Moscow URS-ch16, scoring 8½/18 for 12th place, where the winners were David Bronstein and Alexander Kotov. He had to return to the Soviet semifinal level at Tbilisi 1949, where he placed 3rd with 10½/17 to advance. At Moscow URS-ch17, 1949, he showed solid improvement, finishing tied 9th–10th with 10/19, as Bronstein and Vasily Smyslov won. In 1950, he took 3rd in Pärnu, 7th in Tbilisi, and tied 4th–5th in the Spartak Club Championship. He missed Finals qualifying at Tartu 1950 (URS-ch18sf) with 9½/15 for fifth place. In 1954, he took 2nd, behind Vladas Mikėnas in Vilnius (Quadrangular). Kholmov won, or tied for 1st, in the Lithuanian championships in 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1960, making a total of ten outright or shared Lithuanian titles. This consistent success meant that he could be a full-time chess professional.  International debut  Kholmov made his international debut at Bucharest 1954 with a tied 3rd–4th place, on 11/17, as Viktor Korchnoi won. He placed 6th at Kiev 1954 in the URS-ch21 with 10½/19, with Yuri Averbakh winning; this heralded his arrival in the Soviet elite. FIDE awarded Kholmov the International Master (IM) title in 1954. He tied for 3rd–6th places at Leningrad 1955–56 with 10½/18, as Vladimir Antoshin won. Kholmov tied for 1st–2nd places at Dresden 1956 with Averbakh on 12/15. He earned the International Master title for this. A very solid tied 5th–7th place at URS-ch23 in Leningrad 1956, with 10½/17, reinforced his high- echelon status. He maintained this standard at the next Soviet final, URS-ch24 at Moscow 1957, with 6th place on 12½/21. He placed 2nd at Szczawno-Zdrój 1957 with 11/15 behind winner Efim Geller. Kholmov won the Soviet semifinal at Tashkent 1958 with 11½/15, ahead of Korchnoi and Geller. His first clear international title was at Balatonfüred 1959, where he scored 10/13 to edge Wolfgang Uhlmann. In the URS-ch26 at Tbilisi 1959, Kholmov continued his improvement at the top Soviet level with a tied 4th–5th place, with 12/19, as Tigran Petrosian won.  Grandmaster  Kholmov scored one of the best results of his career with a tied 1st–2nd, along with Smyslov, at the Moscow International 1960 with 8½/11. The same year FIDE awarded him the Grandmaster (GM) title. He won the Soviet semifinal at Novgorod 1961 with 13/16. In Baku, at URS-ch29 (December 1961), he scored 11/20 to tie for 8th–11th places. He was clear first at Bucharest 1962 with 11½/15, ahead of Vladislav Shianovsky. He tied for 2nd–4th places in the Spartak Championship at Minsk 1962 with 11/17, behind Anatoly Bannik. Kholmov won at Kecskemét 1962 with 11/15, ahead of Lajos Portisch and László Szabó, who tied for 2nd–3rd places. He placed 4th in the URS-ch30 at Yerevan 1962 with 13/19, a point behind champion Korchnoi. In 1963 he shared 1st–3rd, with Boris Spassky and Leonid Stein, at Leningrad at the 31st Soviet Chess Championships. Stein prevailed in the three man playoff. Consequently, Kholmov is arguably the strongest player of the era ranging from the 1940s through the 1960s to never hold the title of Soviet Champion. (Isaac Boleslavsky is the only other player of Kholmov's strength in that period to never hold the title.) At Sochi 1964, Kholmov tied 2nd–3rd places with 10/15, behind winner Nikolai Krogius. Then Kholmov suffered perhaps his greatest career disappointment in the Soviet Zonal tournament, Moscow 1964, where he scored 6/12 for 4th in a super-strong field, but fell one place short of advancing to the Interzonal stage. At Kiev in the URS-ch32 (1964/65), Kholmov tied 5th–6th places with 11½/19, as Korchnoi won. He made a notable result at Havana 1965 with 5th place on 14½/21, as Smyslov won, but Kholmov defeated Bobby Fischer and finished undefeated in the tournament. At Tbilisi 1966/67 for URS-ch34, he scored 10/20 to tie for 10th–12th places, as Stein won again. Kholmov moved to Moscow in 1967 and lived there for the rest of his life. He won at Belgrade 1967 with 6½/9. One of his best career results was 2nd in a very strong field at Leningrad 1967 with 12/16, behind Korchnoi. He was 4th in an excellent field at Skopje 1967 with 11½/17, as Fischer won. Kholmov won at Havana 1968 with a powerful 12/14, ahead of Stein and Alexey Suetin. His play in the next four Soviet finals continued to be strong. At Alma-Ata 1968/69 for URS-ch36, he placed 6th–9th with 10½/19, as Lev Polugaevsky and Alexander Zaitsev won. The next Interzonal qualifier was URS- ch37 at Moscow 1969, and he finished tied 7th–9th with 12½/22, with Polugaevsky and Petrosian winning; this was a point short of advancing to the Interzonal. At Riga 1970 for URS-ch38, he dropped a bit with just 10/21 for a tied 13th–14th, as Korchnoi won. Then in Baku 1972 for URS-ch40, he had 10½/21 for a tied 10th–11th place, with Tal winning. This was his last Soviet final. His form in his late 40s had substantially fallen from his best years, and a new generation of Soviet players would earn most of the top tournament places and international opportunities. Kholmov got just one chance to represent the USSR in a team event at full international level when he played board ten at the European Team Championships, Kapfenberg 1970. He won the board gold medal with 4½/6 (+3−0=3), and helped his side to team gold. Kholmov did play in many national matches, such as against Hungary and Yugoslavia, generally scoring well. The Chessmetrics website statistically estimates his retroactive ranking at a minimum of Top 25 in the world from 1956 to 1970, with his peak ranking being 8th in 1960–61. They further estimate that his peak rating was 2736, also in 1961.  Later years  Kholmov continued to stay very active in competitive play, and he was generally quite successful. At Luhacovice 1973, he tied for 4th–5th places with 9/15, with Andras Adorjan and Jan Smejkal winning. At Sochi 1974, he scored 8½/15 for a tied 4th–6th place, with Polugaevsky winning. He placed 2nd at Kecskemét 1975 with 8½/13 behind winner Karolyi Honfi. One of Kholmov's best late-career results was his tied 3rd–5th place in a very strong Moscow 1975 tournament, with 9½/15, as Geller won. He tied for 1st–2nd at Budapest 1976 on 10½/15 with László Vadász. He placed 2nd at Zalaegerszeg 1977 with 7½/12 behind Evgeni Vasiukov. At age 63, Kholmov tied 3rd–6th at Sochi 1988 with 7/13, as Sergey Dolmatov won. At Voskresensk 1990, Kholmov tied 3rd–6th on 6½/11 behind winners Igor Naumkin and Valery Neverov. He had an excellent 2nd place at Moscow 1991 with 8½/11 behind winner Mikhail Ivanov. At age 72, Kholmov tied for 1st–3rd at Moscow 1997 on 7½/11 with Igor Zaitsev and Andrey Rychagov.  World Senior Champion  Kholmov tied for the title in the 2000 World Senior Championship at Rowy, on 8/11 with Mark Taimanov, Jānis Klovāns, and Alexander Chernikov. Then he placed 2nd–4th in the same event the next year at Arco, again with 8/11, tied with Klovans and Vladimir Karasev, behind champion Vladimir Bukal, Sr.. Kholmov played competitive chess virtually right up until his death in early 2006 at age 80. He appeared in a Senior event in Dresden, 50 years after he won a tournament there.  Legacy  Kholmov was known as \\"The Central Defender\\" in Soviet chess circles, because of his great skill at repulsing enemy aggression. But he was also a very dangerous attacker, as most of the leading Soviet players learned. During his peak years, Kholmov was difficult to defeat, even at the top levels. He qualified for 16 Soviet finals between 1949 and 1972, with an aggregate well over 50 per cent. He scored wins over World Champions Petrosian, Spassky, Fischer, and Garry Kasparov. Kholmov was comfortable as White with both 1.e4 and 1.d4, could play excellent classical chess with both colours, and had an occasional fondness for unusual openings, with which he had good success, as the game selection shows.  Notable chess games  *Efim Geller vs. Ratmir Kholmov, USSR Championship, Moscow 1949, Ruy Lopez, Bird's Defence (C61), 0–1 Two rising stars battle for position late in the tournament, and Kholmov scores with an offbeat variation, unleashing a lovely rook sacrifice in the endgame. *Tigran Petrosian vs. Ratmir Kholmov, USSR Championship, Moscow 1957, Blumenfeld Gambit (E10), 0–1 Another unusual defensive choice takes off the future World Champion. *Viktor Korchnoi vs. Ratmir Kholmov, USSR Championship semifinal, Tashkent 1958, Modern Benoni Defence (A64), 0–1 The Modern Benoni was just coming into fashion around this time. *Ratmir Kholmov vs. Paul Keres, USSR Championship, Tbilisi 1959, Sicilian Defence, Rossolimo Variation (B30), 1–0 It's highly unusual to see the powerful tactician Keres get knocked off so quickly. *Ratmir Kholmov vs. Laszlo Szabo, Kecskemet 1962, Slav Defence, Czech Variation (D19), 1–0 Kholmov overcomes the nine-time Hungarian champion. *Ratmir Kholmov vs. Leonid Stein, USSR Championship, Yerevan 1962, Sicilian Defence, Moscow Variation (B52), 1–0 Kholmov again scores with this unusual Sicilian line against one of his great rivals from this period. *Mark Taimanov vs. Ratmir Kholmov, USSR Championship, Leningrad 1963, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Rubinstein / Gligoric Variation (E54), 0–1 Taimanov was a recognized expert on both sides of this defence. *Ratmir Kholmov vs. Boris Spassky, USSR Zonal Tournament, Moscow 1964, Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation (B84), 1–0 Spassky was the tournament winner and a future World Champion. *Ratmir Kholmov vs. David Bronstein, USSR Championship, Kiev 1964–65, Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation (B99), 1–0 Kholmov outplays the creative attacker Bronstein for one of his most memorable victories. *Robert Fischer vs. Ratmir Kholmov, Havana 1965, Ruy Lopez, Closed / Chigorin Variation (C98), 0–1 Fischer lost exceptionally rarely on the White side of the Ruy Lopez, so this win was quite an achievement. *Ratmir Kholmov vs. Garry Kasparov, USSR Championship Qualifying Tournament, Daugavpils 1978, Caro–Kann Defence, Classical Variation (B18), 1–0 Kasparov, just 15 at the time, was the tournament winner and a future World Champion.

Thompson Academy, commonly referred to as Thompson Academy or MBTA, is an e-learning institution operating as a \\"New Century Public Charter School\\" under the Hawaii Department of Education. Thompson Academy is the result of a white paper study developed by the school's principal, Diana Oshiro, detailing the feasibility of a school delivered over the internet. Established in 1999 as Hawaii e-Charter, Thompson Academy is available to students across the state of Hawaii exclusively through the internet, as an alternative-of-choice to local schools. The school is currently accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Early beginnings The concept for Thompson Academy predates the inception of Hawaii's E-School system. In 1994, state Assistant Superintendent Diana Oshiro began writing a white paper discussing the use of the internet as a medium to deliver courses. This white paper later went on to win a five-year grant from the US Department of Education and became what is now known as the Hawaii E-School system, the collaboration between the Hawaii Department of Education and US Department of Education to create, test and provide supplemental courses over the internet. E-School was largely considered a success in delivering courses. Five years later, as the federal grant was concluding, those responsible for E-School's success began investigating the viability and sustainability of a virtual charter school, based on lessons learned from the project. From this investigation, the development of a charter quickly progressed, with a statewide Hawaii e-Charter being brought to fruition in 1999 and granted a charter by the Hawaii Department of Education in 2000. As word spread of the new virtual school, Hawaii e-Charter began to see explosive growth, multiplying its enrollments year-over-year. In 2002 Hawaii e-Charter renamed itself Myron B. Thompson Academy, paying homage to Hawaii educator and former trustee of Kamehameha Schools, Myron \\"Pinky\\" B. Thompson. In that same year, the school began offering elementary education, for students entering kindergarten through grade six. Thompson's rise in Hawaii As a virtual institution, Thompson Academy is markedly different from its traditional counterparts in secondary education, so much so that it has begun to proliferate a broader spectrum of potential students. While teachers and other hallmarks of education remain in the formation of this school, it can largely be considered innovative in the landscape of education in Hawaii. K-12 education Thompson Academy provides two unique schools of education, a home school based elementary program and an online secondary program (high school). Together, these two schools provide a full, alternative solution to compulsory education. =Elementary education= :Thompson Academy's K-6 division is a supported home school program. Families are provided a stipend for educational supplies and curriculum, and are provided guidance in the education of their children. =Secondary education= :Students in grades 7-12 are enrolled in the school's online, secondary education program. With course-content available exclusively over the internet, students progress their studies with a school provided laptop computer. Teachers located at the school's principal operating base of Honolulu administer courses, provide content guidance and other assistance to students, and track their continual progress in courses. The vast majority of students enrolled in the school are in this program. Curriculum over the internet Thompson Academy's unique attributes continue to spark the interest of students in Hawaii. Notably, features that have attracted students and families to the school are: * One-to-One Computer Education: Thompson Academy offers each student a school issued laptop for use in their studies and projects. * Flexibility: Online education provides flexibility where conventional schools cannot, simply requiring an Internet connection and a suitable environment to begin studying and learning. Students are generally not required to enter the halls of the school's campuses, unless they require face-to-face consultation with teachers. Ultimately, this flexibility also allows students to progress faster through course content than they would otherwise at other schools, with the avoidance of class disruptions and other undesirable elements of traditional classrooms. *Quality: While course content does not strongly deviate from conventional courses, due to the learning environment involved, higher quality course delivery is possible as students can better focus on their studies. * Operation as Public School: There is no tuition to enroll at Thompson Academy, with the only out-of-pocket expenses consisting of a nominal fee for incidental insurance on school issued laptops. * Increased Communication: Making use of technology, the school employs various ways to keep its students, faculty and parents informed, including email, teacher mobile phones, discussion boards and chat applications. * Environmental & Cultural Education: Taking advantage of the unique landscape Hawaii provides, Thompson Academy bases several traditional classes/magnets on the land and ocean that surround Hawaii, the creatures that inhabit both, and the unique Hawaiian culture. Campuses Although Thompson Academy is principally located in Honolulu (Oahu), the school has several satellite campuses where students can receive additional help and tutoring from site teachers and socialize with other students. Satellite campuses are located on the neighboring islands of Maui, the Big Island and Kauai. These satellite campuses facilitate the majority of educational needs and support required by outer-island students. Extracurricular activities Thompson Academy provides a small number of extracurricular student activities, including: * Student Government * Athletics, including Basketball Notable students * Bethany Hamilton, female professional surfer and shark attack survivor References *Hawaii Department of Education, Accreditation (accessed March 21, 2006) * Honolulu Advertiser, \\"Charter school popularity up\\" (accessed March 21, 2006) * Honululu Advertiser, \\"E-school learning hoops the hard way\\" (accessed March 21, 2006) External links * Myron B.

The Parable of the Faithful Servant (or Parable of the Door Keeper) is a parable of Jesus found in Matthew 24:42-51, Mark 13:34-37, and Luke 12:35-48 about how it is important for the faithful to keep watch. In Matthew's Gospel, it immediately precedes the Parable of the Ten Virgins, which has a similar eschatological theme of being prepared for the day of reckoning.  Narrative  In Luke's Gospel, the parable reads as follows: Interpretation In Matthew, the parable opens with the injunction: \\"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\\" (Matthew 24:42). In other words, \\"the disciple must remain prepared for his Lord's coming, remaining alert and awake at his post.\\"Craig S. Keener, A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Eerdmans, 1999, , p. 592. Even though there may be general signs of Jesus' Second Coming, the exact time is unknown. This is a theme which has also been discussed earlier in Luke 12.Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 497-501. The reference to a wedding banquet in Luke 12:36 suggests a heavenly banquet, and recalls the parable of the Ten Virgins, which follows this parable in Matthew. The second part of the parable includes a caution that much will be required of the person to whom much is given. J. Dwight Pentecost writes that this parable \\"emphasizes that privilege brings responsibility and that responsibility entails accountability.\\"J. Dwight Pentecost, The Parables of Jesus: Lessons in life from the Master Teacher, the parable in Gospel says regel Publications, 1998, , p. 175. This applies particularly to religious leaders.Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 506. Hymns The parable is the theme for several hymns, including Philip Doddridge's \\"Ye Servants of the Lord,\\" which ends: > Christ shall the banquet spread With His own royal hand, And raise that > faithful servant’s Amid the angelic band.The Cyber Hymnal: Ye Servants of > the Lord.

History The station, circa 1879. The original Portadown station was sited half a mile east of the present station and opened on 12 September 1842, replacing a temporary station at Seagoe that had opened the preceding year. The Portadown station was moved to the present location in 1848 then reverted to its original site between 1863 and 1970. Goods traffic ceased on 4 January 1965. The present station opened in 1970, replacing a large and largely redundant station. At the time (1970) the station was called Portadown - Craigavon West, a title that was quietly dropped after the \\"new city\\" Craigavon failed to materialise. The layout of the 1970 station was modified in 1997 to allow bi-directional working on all three platforms. The lines to Cavan via Armagh (closed 1957), and Derry via Dungannon and Omagh (closed 1965) diverged immediately west of the present station. Portadown new station in 1970 Portadown station in 1972. In 2012, work began on a major refurbishment of the station. A new, modern building was constructed and a footbridge replaced the subway. The refurbishment was completed in 2013. Lay-out The station has three platforms. After the station upgrade being completed in late May 2013 both platforms 1, 2 and 3 have lifts and have disability access. Platform 3 is usually used for storage of a train but one departs from this platform occasionally towards Great Victoria Street.

Historically, Bothriolepis resided in an array of paleo- environments spread across every paleocontinent, including near shore marine and freshwater settings. Most species of Bothriolepis were characterized as relatively small, benthic, freshwater detritivores (organisms that obtain nutrients by consuming decomposing plant/animal material), averaging around in length. However, the largest species, B. rex, had an estimated bodylength of . Although expansive with over 60 species found worldwide, comparatively Bothriolepis is not unusually more diverse than most modern bottom dwelling species around today.  Classification  Bothriolepis is a genus placed within the placoderm order Antiarchi. The earliest antiarch placoderms first appeared in the Silurian period of the Paleozoic Era and could be found distributed on every paleocontinent by the Devonian period. The earliest members of Bothriolepis appear by the Middle Devonian. Antiarchs, as well as other placoderms, are morphologically diverse and are characterized by bony plates that cover their head and the anterior part of the trunk. Early ontogenetic stages of placoderms had thinner bony plates within both the head and trunk-shield, which allowed for easy distinction between early placoderm ontogenetic stages within the fossil record and taxa that possessed fully developed bony plates but were small by characterization. Placoderm bony plates were generally made up of three layers, including a compact basal lamellar bony layer, a middle spongy bony layer and a superficial layer; Bothriolepis can be classified as a placoderm since it possesses these layers. Placoderms were extinct by the end of the Devonian. Placodermi is a paraphyletic group of the clade Gnathostomata, which includes all jawed vertebrates. It is unclear exactly when gnathostomes emerged, but the scant early fossil record indicates that it was sometime in the Early Palaeozoic era. The last species of Bothriolepis died out, together with the rest of Placodermi, at the end of the Devonian period.  General anatomy  Cast of a B. canadensis fossil  Head  There are two openings through the head of Bothriolepis: a keyhole opening along the midline on the upper side for the eyes and nostrils and an opening for the mouth on the lower side near the anterior end of the head. A discovery regarding preserved structures that appear to be nasal capsules confirms the belief that the external nasal openings lay on the dorsal side of the head near the eyes. Additionally, the position of the mouth on the ventral side of the skull is consistent with the typical horizontal resting orientation of Bothriolepis. It had a special feature on its skull, a separate partition of bone below the opening for the eyes and nostrils enclosing the nasal capsules called a preorbital recess.  Jaw  A new sample from the Gogo Formation in the Canning Basin of Western Australia has provided evidence regarding the morphological features of the visceral jaw elements of Bothriolepis. Using the sample, it is evident that the mental plate (a dermal bone that forms the upper part of the jaw) of antiarchs is homologous with the suborbital plate found in other placoderms. The lower jawbone consists of differentiated blade and biting portions. Next to the mandibular joint are the prelateral and infraprelateral plates, which both are canal-bearing bones. The palatoquadrate lacks a high orbital process and was attached only to the ventral part of the mental plate, proving that the ethmoidal region of the braincase (the region of the skull that separates the brain and nasal cavity) was in fact deeper than originally believed. In addition to the above listed sample from the Gogo Formation, several other specimens have been found with mouthparts held in the natural position by a membrane that covers the oral region and attaches to the lateral and anterior margins of the head. Bothriolepis has a jaw in which the two halves are separate and in the adult are functionally independent.  Trunk  B. canadensis carapace Bothriolepis had a slender trunk that was likely covered in soft skin with no scales or markings. The orientation that appears to have been most stable for resting was dorsal surface up, evidenced by the flat surface on the ventral side. The trunk's outline suggests that there may have been a notochord present surrounded by a membranous sheath, however there is no direct evidence of this since the notochord is made up of soft tissue, which is not typically preserved in the fossil record. Similar to other antiarchs, the thoracic shield of Bothriolepis was attached to its heavily armored head. Its box-like body was enclosed in armor plates, providing protection from predators. Attached to the ventral surface of the trunk is a large, thin, circular plate marked by deep-lying lines and superficial ridges. This plate lies just below the opening to the cloaca.  Dermal skeleton  The dermal skeleton is organized in three layers: a superficial lamellar layer, a cancellous spongiosa, and a compact basal lamellar layer. Even in early ontogeny, these layers are apparent in specimen of Bothriolepis canadensis. The compact layers develop first. The superficial layer is speculated to have denticles that may have been made of cellular bone.  Fins and tail  Reconstruction Bothriolepis had a long pair of spine-like pectoral fins, jointed at the base, and again a little more than halfway along. These spike-like fins were probably used to lift the body clear off the bottom; its heavy armor would have made it sink quickly as soon as it lost forward momentum. It may also have used its pectoral fins to throw sediment (mud, sand or otherwise) over itself. In addition to the pectoral fins, it also had two dorsal fins: a low, elongated anterior dorsal fin and a high rounded posterior dorsal fin —though the hypothesized structure of the dorsal fins varies based on the specific species of Bothriolepis and has been modified several times in the reconstructions released by researchers as new information has become available. The caudal tail was elongated, ending in a narrow band, but is unfortunately rarely preserved in fossils. Although there is no agreed upon explanation of their function, Bothriolepis also had two membranous, ventral frills located on the posterior end of the trunk carapace on either side of the tail that each have two distinct regions. There is no evidence that the frills were involved in support of the skeleton but it is possible that they either functioned as fins or were involved in reproduction, and may have even been present in one sex but not the other.  Soft anatomy  Restoration of the upper and underside of B. canadensis Structures composed of soft tissue are typically not preserved in fossils because they break down easily and decompose much faster than hard tissues, meaning that the fossil record often lacks information regarding the internal anatomy of fossil species. Preservation of soft tissue structures can sometimes occur, however, if sediments fill the internal structures of an organism upon or after its death. Robert Denison's paper titled \\"The Soft Anatomy of Bothriolepis\\" explores the forms and organs of Bothriolepis. These internal structures were preserved when different types of sediments surrounding the exterior of the animal filled the internal carapaces (only organs that communicate with the exterior could be preserved in this manner). Three different sediment types were identified within the different sections of Bothriolepis: the first a pale greenish-gray medium-textured sandstone largely consisting of calcite; the second a similar but finer sediment which preserves many of the organ forms; and the third a distinct, fine-grained siltstone consisting of quartz, mica and other minerals but no calcite. These sediments helped preserve the following internal elements:  Alimentary system  In general, the alimentary system of Bothriolepis –which includes the organs involved in ingestion, digestion and removal of waste– can be described as simple and straight, unlike that of humans. It begins at the anterior end of the organism with a small mouth cavity located over the posterior area of the upper jaw plates. Posteriorly from the mouth, the alimentary system extends into a wider and dorso-ventrally flattened region called the pharynx, from which both the gills and lungs arise. The esophagus, which is also characterized as a dorso- ventrally flattened tube, extends from the mouth into the stomach and leads to a flattened ellipsoidal structure. This structure may be homologous to the anterior end of the intestine found in other fish. The flatness of these structures may have been exaggerated when the fossil specimens experienced tectonic deformation through geologic time. The intestine begins narrowly on the anterior end, expands transversely and then again narrows posteriorly towards the cylindrical rectum, which terminates just within the posterior end of the trunk carapace. While the alimentary system is primitive in nature and lacks an expanded stomach region, it is specialized by an independently acquired complex spiral valve, comparable to that in elasmobranchs and many bony fish and similar to that found in some sharks. A single fold of tissue rolled upon its own axis forms this specialized spiral valve.  Gills  It is inferred that the gills of Bothriolepis are of the primitive type, though their structure is still not well understood. Laterally, they are enclosed by an opercular fold and are found in the space beneath the lateral part of the head shield, extending medially underneath the neurocranium. Compared to the gills of normally-shaped fish, the gill region of Bothriolepis is considered to be placed more dorsally, is anteriorly more crowded and, in general, is relatively short and broad.  Paired ventral sacs  B. canadensis fossil in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago Life restoration of B. canadensis Extending posteriorly from the trunk carapace are paired ventral sacs that extend to the anterior end of the spiral intestine. The sacs seem to originate at the pharynx as a single median tube, which then broadens posteriorly and eventually splits into two sacs that may be homologous to the lungs of certain dipnoans and tetrapods. It has been hypothesized that these lungs, coupled with the jointed arms and rigid, supportive skeleton, would have allowed Bothriolepis to travel on land. Additionally, as Robert Denison states, because there is no evidence of connection between the external naris and mouth, Bothriolepis likely breathed similarly to present-day lungfish, i.e., by placing the mouth above the water's surface and swallowing air. Despite the original interpretation presented by Denison in 1941, not all paleontologists agree that placoderms like Bothriolepis actually possessed lungs. For example, in his paper \\"Lungs\\" in Placoderms, a Persistent Palaeobiological Myth Related to Environmental Preconceived Interpretations, D. Goujet suggests that although traces of some digestive organs may be apparent from the sedimentary structures, there is no evidence supporting the presence of lungs in the samples from the Escuminac formation of Canada upon which the original assertion was based. He notes that the worldwide distribution of Bothriolepis is restricted to strictly marine environments, and thus believes that the presence of lungs in Bothriolepis is uncertain. Further investigation of the fossils is likely necessary to reach a conclusion about the presence of lungs in Bothriolepis.  Feeding  Bothriolepis, as with all other antiarchs, are thought to have fed by directly swallowing mouthfuls of mud and other soft sediments in order to digest detritus, small or microorganisms, algae, and other forms of organic matter in the swallowed sediments. Additionally, the positioning of the mouth on the ventral side of its head further suggests that Bothriolepis was likely a bottom-feeder. The regular presence of \\"carbonaceous material in the alimentary tract\\" is believed to indicate that most of its diet consisted of plant material.  Distribution  Paleogeography during the Middle Devonian (380 Ma) By Stampfli & Borel, 2000 Bothriolepis fossils are found in Middle and Late Devonian strata (from 387 to 360 million years ago). Because the fossils are found in freshwater sediments, Bothriolepis is presumed to have spent most of its life in freshwater rivers and lakes, but was probably able to enter salt water as well, because its range appeared to have corresponded with the Devonian continental coastlines. Large groupings of Bothriolepis specimens have been found in Asia, Europe, Australia (Gogo Formation), Pennsylvania (Catskill Formation), Quebec (Escuminac Formation), Virginia (Chemung), Colorado, Cuche Formation (Boyacá, Colombia), and all around the world.  Catskill Formation site  The Catskill Formation (Upper Devonian, Famennian Stage), located in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, is the site of a large sample of small individuals of Bothriolepis. The sample was collected from a series of rock slabs that consisted of partial or complete, articulated, external skeletons. More than two hundred individuals were found packed closely together with little to no overlap. From this sample, much information regarding characteristics of juvenile Bothriolepis can be determined. A morphometric study performed by Jason Downs and co-authors highlights certain characteristics that indicate juvenility in Bothriolepis, including a moderately large head and moderately large orbital fenestra—both of which are characteristics also recognized by Erik Stensio in 1948 in the smallest B. canadensis individuals. Several other features that Stensio marked indicative of young individuals can also be seen exhibited in the Catskill sample. These features include \\"delicate dermal bones with ornament consisting of continuous anastomosing ridges rather than tubercles, a dorsal trunk shield narrower than long and with a continuous and pronounced dorsal median ridge, and a pre- median plate that is wider than it is long\\".  Species  Vertebrate palaeontology is heavily dependent on the ability to differentiate between different species in a way that is consistent both within a particular genus and across all organisms. The genus Bothriolepis is no exception to this principle. Listed below are a few of the notable species within Bothriolepis; more than sixty species have been named in total, and it is likely that a sizeable proportion of them are valid due to the cosmopolitan nature of Bothriolepis.  Bothriolepis canadensis  B. canadensis preserved with Scaumenacia cyrta, a prehistoric sarcopterygian Bothriolepis canadensis is a taxon that often serves as a model organism for the order Antiarchi because of its enormous sample of complete, intact specimens found at the Escuminac Formation in Quebec, Canada. Because of the vast sample size, this species is often used to compare growth data of newly acquired specimens of Bothriolepis, including those found in the Catskill Formation mentioned above. This comparison allows researchers to determine if newly found samples represent juvenile individuals or new \\"Bothriolepis\\" species. B. canadensis was first described in 1880 by J.F. Whiteaves, using a limited number of disfigured samples. The next to propose a reconstruction of the species was W. Patten, who published his findings in 1904 after a discovery of several specimens that were well preserved in 3-D. In 1948, E. Stensio released a detailed depiction of B. canadensis anatomy using an abundance of material, which eventually became the most widely accepted description of this species. Since Stensio's publication, many others have provided reconstructed models of B. canadensis with modified aspects of the anatomy, including Vezina's modified single dorsal fin and more recently, reconstructions by Arsenault et al from specimens with little taphonomic distortion. Presently, the model of Arsenault et al. is regarded to be the most accurate, while there is still much debate about various aspects of this species' external anatomy. Despite the uncertainty, B. canadensis is still classically considered one of the most well known species. The external skeleton of Bothriolepis canadensis is made of cellular dermal bone tissue and is characterized by distinct horizontal zonation or stratification. The model fish has an average total length of and an average dermal armor length of , which accounts for 35.6% of the estimated total length. Like many antiarchs, B. canadensis also had narrow pectoral fins, a heterocercal caudal fin (meaning the notochord extends into the upper lobe of the caudal tail) and a large dorsal fin which likely didn't play an important role in propulsion but instead acted more as a stabilizer  Bothriolepis rex  Originally described by Downs et al. (2016), Bothriolepis rex is from the Nordstrand Point Formation of Ellesmere Island, Canada. B. rex's body length is estimated at 1.7 meters and is therefore the largest known species of Bothriolepis. Its armor is especially thick and dense even when taking its size into account. Downs et al. (2016) suggest that this may have both protected the animal from large predators and served as ballast to prevent this large bottom dweller from floating to the surface.  Bothriolepis virginiensis  B. panderi fossil from Russia B. tungseni from China Originally described by Weems et al. in 1981, this species, Bothriolepis virginiensis, is from the \\"Chemung\\", near Winchester, Virginia. Several traits found in B. virginiensis can also be found in other species of Bothriolepis, (especially B. nitida), including posterior oblique cephalic sensory line grooves that meet relatively far anteriorly on the nuchal plate, relatively elongated orbital fenestra and a low anterior-median-dorsal crest. Characteristics that distinguish B. virginiensis from other species include but are not limited to fused head sutures, fused elements in adult distal pectoral fin segments and long premedian plate relative to headshield length. Currently, there is much debate regarding whether the species B. virginiensis and B. nitida can actually be distinguished from one another. Thomson and Thomas state that five species of Bothriolepis from the United States (B. nitida, B. minor, B. virginiensis, B. darbiensis and B. coloradensis) are unable to be consistently distinguished from one another. Conversely, Weems asserts that there are several traits that distinguish the species from one another, including several listed above.  Bothriolepis nitida  This species, found in present-day Pennsylvania, was originally described by J. Leidy in 1856. As mentioned above, there is much debate regarding the distinguishability between B. nitida and B. virginiensis, however based on evidence presented by Weems (2004), there are several distinguishable traits specific to each species. B. nitida has a maximum headshield length of , a narrow and shallow trifid preorbital recess, has an anterior-median-dorsal (AMD) plate that is wider than it is long and a ventral thoracic shield that has convex lateral borders.  Bothriolepis coloradensis  First described by Eastman in 1904, this species was found localized in present-day Colorado. There is a possibility that this species is similar, if not identical, to B. nitida, however because the material available regarding B. coloradensis is fragmented, it is impossible to compare the two species with any degree of certainty.

Like other thresher sharks, nearly half its total length consists of the elongated upper lobe of the tail fin. Its common name comes from its enormous eyes, which are placed in keyhole-shaped sockets that allow them to be rotated upward. This species can also be distinguished by a pair of deep grooves on the top of its head, from which its scientific name is derived. The large eyes of the bigeye thresher are adapted for hunting in low light conditions. It is one of the few sharks that conduct a diel vertical migration, staying in deep water during the day and moving into surface waters at night to feed. To protect its sensitive brain and eyes from the temperature changes accompanying these movements, the bigeye thresher has a vascular exchange system called the rete mirabile around those organs. This species feeds mainly on fish and squid, which are stunned via whip-like strikes of the long tail. Bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous, usually bearing litters of two pups. The embryos are oophagous and feed on ova produced by the mother while inside the uterus. This shark is caught by commercial fisheries across its range; the meat is not highly regarded but the skin, fins, and liver oil are valued. It has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Taxonomy and phylogeny British biologist Richard Thomas Lowe was the first to scientifically describe the bigeye thresher, in papers published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (1840) and Transactions of the Zoological Society of London (1849, sometimes given as 1839). He based his description on a specimen caught off Madeira in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. However, Lowe's description was subsequently overlooked by researchers and this species was known by different names until the 1940s, when new specimens from Cuba and Florida prompted its original scientific name to be resurrected. The specific epithet superciliosus is from the Latin super meaning \\"above\\", and ciliosus meaning \\"eyebrow\\", referring to the distinct lateral grooves above the eyes.Jensen, C. Bigeye Thresher. Florida Museum of Natural History. Retrieved on December 21, 2008. An allozyme analysis conducted by Blaise Eitner in 1995 showed that the closest relative of the bigeye thresher is the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus), with which it forms a clade. Fossil remains of the bigeye thresher dating to the Middle Miocene (16.0-11.6 Ma) have been found in the Hokuriku region of Japan. Distribution and habitat The bigeye thresher has a virtually circumtropical distribution. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it has been reported from New York to Florida, the Caribbean, Venezuela, Tobago and southern Brazil. In the eastern Atlantic, it is known from Portugal, Madeira, Senegal, Guinea to Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Indian Ocean, it occurs off South Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Sea. In the Pacific Ocean, it is known from southern Japan, Taiwan, New Caledonia, northwestern Australia, and New Zealand, and eastward to Hawaii, southern California, the Gulf of California, and west of the Galapagos Islands. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has shown that Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations are somewhat genetically divergent from each other.Trejo, T. (2005). \\"Global phylogeography of thresher sharks (Alopias spp.) inferred from mitochondrial DNA control region sequences\\". M.Sc. thesis. Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, California State University. Bigeye threshers are usually found over the continental shelf and in the open sea, though they are occasionally encountered in shallow coastal waters. They occur in surface temperatures of , but have been tracked as far down as , where the temperature is only . Little is known of their geographical movements; one individual has been documented moving from New York to the Gulf of Mexico, a straight-line distance of . Description The eyes of the bigeye thresher can measure up to across in adults. Each eye is taller than wide, with a bulbous upper portion. The orbits extend onto the dorsal surface of the head, allowing the eyes to orient upwards. There are also a pair of distinctive lateral grooves that extend from above the eyes to over the gill slits, giving it a \\"helmet\\"-like appearance. The snout is moderately long and bulbous, and there are no labial furrows at the corners of the mouth. The teeth are moderately large with a single, narrow cusp. There are 19-24 teeth in the upper jaw and 20-24 teeth in the lower jaw; their shapes are similar in both jaws. There are large and small dermal denticles, with the smaller ones more numerous and interspersed amongst the larger ones. The smaller denticles taper to a point. Up to half the body length is taken up by the long upper lobe of the caudal fin, which is broader than in other threshers. The large pectoral fins have a curved anterior margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is placed further back than in the other thresher sharks, with the free rear tip located above or just before the pelvic fins. Its coloration is a deep, metallic violet to purplish brown above and creamy white below. This color rapidly fades to a dull gray after death. Most bigeye threshers are long and weigh . The largest known bigeye thresher measured long and weighed , and was caught near Tutukaka, New Zealand, in February 1981.Martin, R.A. Biology of the Bigeye Thresher (Alopias superciliosus). ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on December 21, 2008. Biology and ecology The size and upward orientation of the bigeye thresher's eyes are adapted to search for the silhouettes of prey in dim light. This species is one of a handful of shark species that conducts a diel vertical migration, spending daytime in deeper water between , beneath the thermocline where the temperature ranges from , and ascending above it to water less than deep during nighttime. This migration likely relates to finding prey at night and avoiding predators during the day. The sharks' daytime swimming patterns are usually steady, while at night they have a pattern of slow ascents and rapid descents. Bigeye threshers are likely preyed upon by larger sharks and marine mammals. Known parasites of the bigeye thresher include the copepod Pagina tunica, and the tapeworm Litobothrium janovyi. Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) have been seen attached near the cloaca of this shark. The bigeye thresher appears to be an ecological competitor of the blue shark (Prionace glauca), and the numbers of the two species are negatively correlated such as that only one of two occurs in any given location.

File:Alopias superciliosus male teeth.jpgTeeth, male File:Alopias superciliosus male teeth2.jpgTeeth, male File:Alopias superciliosus female teeth.jpgTeeth, female File:Alopias superciliosus female teeth2.jpgTeeth, female Feeding The enormous eyes of the bigeye thresher allow them to hunt in dim light. The bigeye thresher has larger teeth than other threshers and feeds on a wider variety of prey. Known food items include schooling forage fish such as mackerel and herring, benthic fishes such as hake and whiting, larger pelagic fishes such as lancetfish and small billfish, squid such as lycoteuthids and ommastrephids, and possibly crab megalopae. They likely use their long tails to stun their prey prior to capture, as they are often found hooked by their tails on longlines and with the bait fish in their stomachs. The shape of their eye sockets give them binocular vision in an upward direction to better aim their strikes. In the Mediterranean, they are strongly associated with schools of frigate mackerel (Auxis rochei), suggesting that these sharks follow concentrations of their prey from place to place. It is said that the bigeye thresher uses its long tail to smack down birds. Life history Like other mackerel sharks, bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous and bear litters of two pups, one in each uterus. Very rarely, the litter size may be one, three, or four. There is no defined breeding season and most adult females are pregnant throughout the year without any apparent lag time between pregnancies. The gestation period is unknown. The developing fetuses are initially nourished by a yolk sac, and later on exhibit oophagy, in which they consume infertile eggs produced by their mother (and possibly also uterine fluid). There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus). Unborn embryos are similar in appearance to adults, with proportionally larger heads and eyes. They are covered with a thin layer of epithelium that prevents the uterine wall from being abraded by the embryo's sharp dermal denticles; this has not been observed in the young of other thresher sharks. The young measure long at birth. Males mature at a length around and at an age of 9-10 years, while females mature at a length around and at an age of 12-14 years. The maximum lifespan of this species is believed to be 19 years for a male and 20 years for a female. A female bigeye thresher is estimated to produce only 20 young over her entire life. Thermoregulation There is conflicting evidence on whether the bigeye thresher is warm-bodied like the common thresher (A. vulpinus). In a 1971 study, Carey et al. probed the swimming muscles of two bigeye threshers with a thermistor needle and reported finding a temperature elevation of 1.8 and 4.3 °C (3.8 and 9.1 °F) compared to the ambient environment. However, an anatomical examination conducted by Sepulveda et al. in 2005 found that though the bigeye thresher possesses the aerobic red muscles responsible for generating heat in the common thresher, these muscles are arranged in two strips along the flanks just beneath the skin, as opposed to near the core of the body. There is also no blood vessel countercurrent exchange system (the rete mirabile) in the trunk to limit the loss of metabolic heat to the water. Based on these differences, the authors questioned earlier measurements and concluded it was unlikely that the bigeye thresher maintains an elevated body temperature. The bigeye thresher does possess a highly developed rete system around its brain and eyes. This is thought to function in buffering those sensitive organs against temperature changes during the shark's daily migrations up and down the water column, which can be as much as 15-16 °C (27-29 °F). Human interactions Bigeye threshers are often caught on longlines. The bigeye thresher shark is rarely encountered by divers underwater and poses no danger. This species is or was taken by longline fisheries operated by many countries, including the United States, Japan, Spain, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico, and constitutes about 10% of the pelagic shark catch. The bigeye thresher comprises 20% of the longline catch off Cuba, where it is attracted at night using cyalume sticks (chemical lights). It is also significant to Taiwanese fisheries, which land about 220 metric tons annually. The meat is marketed fresh, smoked, or dried and salted, though it is not highly regarded due to its mushy texture. The skin is used to make leather products, the liver oil for vitamins, and the fins for shark fin soup. In the waters of the United States, this species is considered a nuisance bycatch of longlines, gillnets, and trawls. It is also occasionally caught in shark nets around beaches in South Africa. Along with the other thresher species, the bigeye thresher is listed as a game fish by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA), and is pursued by recreational anglers off the United States, South Africa, and New Zealand. The bigeye thresher is highly susceptible to over-exploitation due to its low lifetime fecundity. All three thresher shark species were assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. In New Zealand, the Department of Conservation has classified the bigeye thresher shark as \\"Not Threatened\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

It is the sequel to the 1983 film Project A. Jackie Chan plays Sergeant Dragon Ma once again, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, stars from the original film, are absent. The film was released in Hong Kong on 19 August 1987. Plot The sequel continues with runaway pirates, who vow that they must kill Dragon Ma to take revenge for their late captain. On recommendation of the Chief of Marine Force, Dragon Ma is transferred to be in charge of the district of Sai Wan after the Superintendent, Chun, is thought to be staging his arrests. Chun, however, has an excellent record and the \\"criminals\\" he has been engaging are shot and killed, so there is no evidence against him. Dragon Ma and his subordinates later meet Yesan and her cousin, Carina, at a teahouse selling flowers to raise funds. He later learns that Carina is a member of the Chinese revolutionaries headed by Dr Sun Yat-sen. Dragon identifies himself as the new superintendent of Sai Wan Police Station, after realizing that all of his policemen except one has been taking bribes. Ho, the only upright policeman around, tells them that a gangster named Tiger Ow with gambling dens and other illegal businesses is the kingpin of the town. When his men are too cowardly to confront Tiger, Dragon is forced to confront him with only Ho and his three friends he brought with him from the Marine Police. After a big fight where the policemen are badly outnumbered, the Marine Police show up with guns and force the gangsters to surrender. After one last fight with Ow, all the gangsters are sent to prison, inspiring the police at the station to do a better job. Dragon is then put in charge of the Governor's security for a birthday ball he is throwing for his adopted daughter. Chun corroborates with a group of revolutionaries to implicate Dragon in a theft of the Governor's diamond pendant. Dragon is arrested. After the ball, Carina is kidnapped by agents of the Empress Dowager, who are working with Chun; they trap her in a wardrobe at Yesan's house. Yesan, Li, Ma, and Ho arrive. Li hides but ends up threatened by one of the imperial agents. Ma and Ho, who are handcuffed together, enter the bathroom. While they are in the bathroom, the commissioner arrives. As Yesan hangs up his uniform, Ma and Ho see the keys to the handcuffs. They break free and hide under the bed, losing the key to the handcuffs. They see the Imperial Agents with Carina in the wardrobe. Then Yesan and the commissioner sit down to talk. The Commissioner demonstrates how to handcuff two people by handcuffing himself to the armchair but can not break free. Chun arrives to visit Yesan, and the commissioner hides under the bed, where he sees Ma and Ho. Yesan finally gets Chun to get out of her house, when Ma, Ho, Tung and Yesan defeat the Imperial agents. Eventually the Imperial Agents are arrested, the revolutionary chief escapes, and Dragon is handcuffed by Chun so that he can be brought to the main prison. Carina flees town with the help of the revolutionaries. Chun arranges for Dragon to be killed by a prison warden. The pirates attack both Dragon and Chun with axes, but they are eventually driven off after the police show up. Dragon is handed over to the prison warden, tied up in a sack, and thrown into the sea. The revolutionaries save Dragon and take him back to their hideout above a medicine store, where they try to enlist him. Dragon refuses to actively help them, saying that he is just a Hong Kong cop. The head of the pirates falls sick, and the pirates enter the medicine store to ask for some herbs. Dragon intervenes and offers to pay for their medicine, causing the pirates to think much better of him. The Imperial agents arrive and apprehend most of the revolutionaries, to gain possession of the black book. Dragon helps Yessan and Miss Pak escape while safeguarding the book. After a frantic run and fight scene, he defeats them with the help of the pirates. The Police Commissioner arrives with a huge police cohort and orders the arrest of Superintendent Chun, now fully aware Chun is trying to murder Dragon. Chun tries to run, but a large bamboo-and-wood stage facade falls on Chun while he attempts to retrieve his moneybag. Dragon, on order of the Commissioner, takes charge of the police. During the end credits, a small vignette featuring Chan singing the theme song, appears above the credits roll.

Plot synopsis Maureen Folan, a 40-year-old spinster, lives in the Irish village of Leenane, Connemara, in the early 1990s with her 70-year-old mother Mag, for whom she acts as caretaker. While Maureen is out, the Folan home is visited by Ray Dooley, a young man, who invites both women to a farewell party for his visiting American uncle. When it seems Mag is incapable of remembering this message, Ray writes it down for Maureen. As soon as he leaves, Mag destroys the note in the furnace. Upon Maureen's return, she admonishes her mother for depending on her as if she were an invalid; despite her bad back and burnt hand, Maureen thinks Mag is capable of doing more for herself. Maureen has already learnt of the party from Ray, whom she passed on her way in, so she punishes Mag for her dishonesty by forcing her to drink lumpy Complan. Maureen, a virgin who has only ever kissed two men, buys a new dress and attends the party. She brings Ray's older brother, Pato, home with her. Pato is a construction worker who lives primarily in London, though he is unhappy both there and in Leenane. He reveals that, although he has barely spoken to Maureen in 20 years of acquaintance, he has secretly thought of her as \\"the beauty queen of Leenane\\" for a long time. She brings him to her bedroom. In the morning, Mag empties her bedpan into the kitchen sink, a daily habit that disgusts Maureen. Pato emerges from the bedroom and prepares breakfast for a shocked Mag, revealing that Maureen insisted he not sneak out. Maureen then emerges, dressed only in her underwear, and flaunts her intimacy with Pato in front of Mag. Incensed, Mag accuses Maureen of having deliberately burnt her hand by pouring hot oil over it, and then reveals that it is actually she who is legally responsible for Maureen after having signed her out of an English \\"loony bin.\\" After Mag goes to find the papers that prove this, Maureen tells Pato that Mag burnt herself trying to cook unsupervised, but she admits that she truly did suffer a nervous breakdown while working as a cleaner in England, 15 years earlier, when she was unable to endure the teasing of her English coworkers. She claims Mag sometimes tries to tell lies about the past, thinking Maureen is unable to discern them from reality. Pato is sympathetic, telling her that his opinion of her is unchanged. However, when he urges her to dress herself for warmth, she becomes insecure about her appearance and throws a tantrum. Mag returns with the documents, but Pato ignores her, departing after telling an upset Maureen that he will write to her. Some time later, Pato writes from London, telling Maureen that he is going to work for his American uncle in Boston, and he wants Maureen to come with him as soon as she can. The letter also reveals that he was unable to perform sexually when they were together, but he tells her that it was only because he had drunk too much. He also tells her that there will be a going away party for him. He sends the letter to Ray, with explicit instructions to put it directly into Maureen's hands. However, when Ray comes to the house, Maureen is out and Mag convinces him to leave the letter with her, playing on his resentment of Maureen for failing to return his swingball that fell in the Folan yard when he was a child and for snubbing him recently in the street. After Ray leaves, Mag reads and burns the letter. On the night of Pato's farewell party, Maureen is aware of Pato's plans but assumes he is uninterested in pursuing a relationship. However, she tells Mag that it was she who ended things with him. When she continues to talk about the sexual encounter, Mag teases her and accidentally lets slip that she is aware of Pato's impotence. Seizing on it, Maureen tortures Mag with hot oil until she confesses the letter's existence and contents. Leaving Mag writhing on the floor, Maureen quickly puts on her dress and rushes out to the party. She returns home after midnight, telling an unmoving Mag that she caught Pato at the train station before he left, and they recommitted themselves to one another. At the end of the scene, Mag slumps to the floor, dead. Maureen has bashed her head in with the poker. A month later, Mag's funeral is held following an inquest that exonerated Maureen. Ray visits, bringing word from Pato. However, it soon becomes clear that Maureen imagined her reunion with Pato; he actually left by taxi without ever seeing Maureen. And now he has become engaged to a woman with whom he danced at the party. Maureen asks Ray to send Pato a message, \\"The beauty queen of Leenane says 'Goodbye.'\\" Ray leaves after discovering and seizing his lost swingball. Left alone in the house, Maureen puts on Mag's sweater, sits in her rocking chair, and adopts her mannerisms.

Empress In January 1185, Margaret married the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who wanted a politically strategic alliance with Hungary in order to strengthen his claim to the throne. Upon this marriage, Margaret took the baptismal name \\"Maria\\". With Isaac, she had two sons: * Manuel Angelos (died 1212), he was evidently the elder son, being contemplated in 1205 to ascend the Byzantine throneRodd, Rennell (1907). p. 78 * John Angelos (b. ca. 1193 – died 1259). He migrated to Hungary and ruled over Syrmia and Bács (1227–42) as a vassal of king Béla IV of Hungary. Isaac had been deposed and blinded in 1195 by his brother Alexios III Angelos who then assumed the throne. Isaac was imprisoned, but it's not yet clear if Margaret was also. Her step-son Alexios IV Angelos had escaped and went to join the military discussions which were shortly to launch the Fourth Crusade. There, he and others convinced the Crusaders to attack Constantinople in order to depose his uncle and restore his imprisoned father and himself to the throne. This was done, but his restored reign was short- lived, as the Crusaders took over the empire for themselves.

Evidently in this same year of 1204, but after his new marriage, Boniface requested that he be allowed to exchange his lands in Asia for the Kingdom of Thessalonica, which he considered to be better suited for a political alignment with his new brother-in-law Andrew, then Regent of Hungary who would then be his neighbour, and the new emperor agreed to this exchange.Rodd, Rennell (1907). p. 64 Boniface however did not enjoy his domains in peace, being engaged in almost constant warfare until his death. Margaret's step-daughter Agnes of Montferrat was married to the new emperor, Henry of Flanders, in February 1207. That same year, Boniface was returning to Thessalonica when he was ambushed by Bulgarians. He was taken alive and decapitated, his head being sent to Kaloyan of Bulgaria.Rodd, Rennell (1907). p. 82 With Boniface, Margaret had a son: *Demetrius of Montferrat in 1207, he wed a sister of the Lord of Athens but they had no children Boniface left a will designating Demetrius as his successor in Thessalonica under the regency of his mother. His son William of Montferrat, by an earlier marriage, succeeded to the Marquisate of Montferrat. The barons however, knowing that a strong government was necessary, constituted themselves a council of regency for the infant. Later life In 1207, on his father's death, Demetrius became king of Thessalonica, at least in title. The Emperor visited Thessalonica to receive the homage in the infant's name, but was barred from the city by the bailiff Biandrate until he would agree to outrageous demands.Rodd, Rennell (1907). p. 85 Margaret, now in the Emperor's presence, put herself in his hands and revealed the plot against the infant. The Emperor then crowned the new infant King of Thessalonica.Rodd, Rennell (1907). p. 86 Biandrate fled, but conspiring at a distance, returned once more in 1216 to claim the Regency. \\"In response to Queen Margaret's appeal the Emperor hurried to her assistance, but arrived on the scene only to die with mysterious suddenness in the flower of his age.\\"Rodd, Rennell (1907). p. 89 About 1216 Margaret fled to Hungary apparently leaving her son Demetrius in Thessalonica. She married thirdly Nicholas I of Saint Omer, who had accompanied his uncle on the Crusade and was granted a fief in Doris. He is also called \\"Lord of Boeotia\\".Rodd, Rennell (1907). p. 153 With Nicholas, Margaret is apparently the mother of his two known sons: * Bela of Saint Omer * William of Saint Omer, who married but died childless. On 30 March 1223, Pope Honorius II took Margaret under his protection, issuing a document that contains a list of her properties.Alexandru Madgearu, The Asanids: The Political and Military History of the Second Bulgarian Empire (1185-1280), p. 133, Brill, 2016, , series: East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages 450-1450 (Book 41) Death Margaret was still living in 1223. Her exact death date and place, and burial location are apparently unknown.

Early career Faleiro was born in Covilhã, Portugal, at the end of the fifteenth century. In his youth, he served as a page of Queen Eleanor, consort of King John II, alongside Magellan. Faleiro began serving Manuel I of Portugal when he succeeded John II in 1495. In 1516, Faleiro applied for the position of royal astronomer, but was rejected by Manuel. Magellan and Faleiro proposed an expedition to the Spice Islands repeatedly to King Manuel, but were rejected each time. Frustrated, the two decided to seek assistance from the Spanish crown instead. In October 1517, Magellan relocated to Seville, Spain, and Faleiro joined him in December. Faleiro's brother, Francisco Faleiro, also an accomplished cosmographer, journeyed to Spain as well, and served as a 'hydrographer and nautical adviser' to the Casa de Contratación. Magellan expedition Having been rejected by the Portuguese king, Faleiro and Magellan presented their proposal to the Casa de Contratación, which managed expeditions on behalf of the crown. Faleiro was certain that south of the \\"Terras de Vera Cruz\\" (i.e. Brazil), at 40 degrees latitude, there was an Atlantic passage that led to the South Seas. The sought-after Spice Islands would, by Faleiro's calculations, fall on the Spanish side of the line of Tordesillas. On March 22, 1518, King Charles of Spain approved the expedition. Magellan and Faleiro were named co-captains of the expedition. Fragmentary sources suggest that Faleiro may have suffered from increasing mental instability as preparations for the expedition proceeded. Sebastian Alvarés, a Portuguese spy reporting to King Manuel, wrote that Faleiro was \\"like a man deranged in his senses\\". An acquaintance of Faleiro wrote that he \\"sleeps very little and wanders around almost out of his mind\\". On July 26, 1519, King Charles, perhaps in response to Faleiro's condition, issued a royal certificate stating that Faleiro would not sail with the expedition, and would instead stay behind in Seville to prepare for another expedition to follow. The later expedition never took place, and may have been a fiction intended to preserve Faleiro's dignity. Other sources state that Faleiro chose to remain behind after performing a horoscope reading indicating that the voyage would be fatal for him. The expedition left Seville without Faleiro on August 10, 1519. The fleet kept Faleiro's state-of-the-art navigational tools, including compasses, astrolabes, hourglasses, and charts. Of the 24 charts taken on the voyage, six were personally created by Faleiro. The rest were created by cosmographer Nuño Garcia (seven under the supervision of Faleiro, and eleven supervised by Magellan). In his duties as the expedition's astronomer and astrologist, Faleiro was replaced by the Spanish cosmographer Andrés de San Martín. Later life After Magellan's fleet set sail, Faleiro returned to Portugal, where he was imprisoned. During his imprisonment he suffered a mental breakdown, but was eventually released. He secretly returned to Seville. The Casa de Contratación awarded him and his brother separation pay \\"because they had arrived worn out and penniless\\". His remaining years were lived in obscurity. Accomplishments Faleiro was one of the first to apply the most rigorously scientific method of determining latitude and longitude.

A meat raffle is also sometimes called a meat draw. In some cases the raffle is operated by a designated charity, though in Britain most of the proceeds are spent on prizes and the raffle is run as a social occasion and a method of enticing customers into a local pub. The meat ranges in animal and cut and often comes from local butchers. In the UK, a typical meat raffle would have approximately 25-30 tickets sold at £1 each, though there is considerable variation and some raffles are much larger. Depending on the specific raffle, when a winning number is called the winner can either pick their cut of meat or opt for a gift certificate. All proceeds typically go to a charity. Also simply known as a meat tray, the tradition is well known in Australian and New Zealand pubs. The trays of meat raffled vary in content: a barbecue style mix of steaks, lamb chops, sausages etc. is the most common, however \\"breakfast trays\\" (bacon, eggs, sausages) and \\"seafood trays\\" (prawns, oysters, mussels) are also common. Meat trays are usually raffled to raise money for local sporting teams, often those associated with the particular pub the raffle occurs in. The proceeds often help fund the team's end of season trip. Care must be taken with seafood trays given the propensity for the contents to spoil in the heat as the lucky winner continues drinking; often a friendly publican will store the tray in the fridge until the winner is sufficiently refreshed and ready to head home. An Australian variant of the meat raffle is the chook raffle, where a chicken is raffled off. A Canadian variant popular primarily in the Sudbury area is \\"Porketta Bingo\\", in which a traditional Italian porchetta is given as a prize in a card game as a fundraiser for local minor hockey leagues.\\"Sudbury’s signature dish is porketta\\". Toronto Star, January 9, 2012. Part of the interval at the BDO World Darts Championship includes a meat raffle to raise funds for youth teams. The Dave TV comedy show Compete for the Meat, hosted by Al Murray, is loosely based on the concept of a meat raffle.

(Note: many characters' names are either taken from or related to cars).Magic Knight Rayearth: The Birth of the Legendary Magic Knights! - TV.com Main characters=Hikaru Shidou is an eighth-grader with bright red eyes and scarlet hair, who is small for her age and often teased for her boyishness. She helps her parents and her three older brothers (Masaru, Satoru and Kakeru) to run a school for Kendo. She is headstrong and determined, and in many ways very childish, but she is fiercely loyal to her friends. In particular, she wants to save Cephiro in the first arc in order to return home to her dog, Hikari, her precious childhood friend. She uses fire-based spells, such as Arrow of Fire (Honoo no Ya) and Crimson Lightning. Hikaru is very popular with fans, especially with boys, because of her sometimes childish behavior; for example, in the manga, where Fuu is \\"asking\\" Ferio to help them, Umi catches on to what she's doing, but Hikaru has no idea what's going on. When Ferio agrees, Umi cheers, as does Hikaru, though she still doesn't get it. It's also mentioned that she's the most popular girl in her all-girls school by her classmates in both adaptations. She becomes best friends with Umi and Fuu in the first season. In the second season, she falls in love with Lantis, and becomes friends with Eagle Vision of Autozam. However, in the manga, Hikaru is only hinted at being romantically involved with Lantis, despite him hinting that he has strong feelings for her. Hikaru claims to love everyone, and due to her innocent nature, probably loves everyone equally. In the anime, Hikaru's affection for Lantis becomes much more apparent. In the second season, when the need for a new Pillar of Cephiro is urgent, people from many different lands flock to Cephiro to become the Pillar. It is apparent from the first moment the girls are told they will be Magic Knights that Hikaru is the most strong-willed and passionate of the group; this leads to her eventually becoming the new Pillar at the end of the season. Hikaru decides that she would rather Cephiro not have to depend on one person's self- sacrifice, and uses her power as the Pillar to destroy the Pillar System and allow Cephiro to function on its own. In some language adaptations, her name was changed to Lucy and Luce. , Venus Terzo in original English dub, Tara Jayne (English) in OVA. Umi Ryuuzaki is elegant with dark blue eyes and long, flowing blue hair. She is an only child of rich parents, the two of which dote on her mercilessly and for whom she has great affection. A fencing champion, she is quick-tempered and at first uncaring (though perhaps the best-suited for the task at hand), as well as the most reluctant of the three Magic Knights: she is under great pressure to attend a fencing contest and is unsure of the land of Cephiro. Umi tends to go slightly ballistic at times, and provides a bit of comic relief during her fights with Mokona. Initially she seems to dislike Mokona, and even when she does become fond of him, occasionally still seems annoyed by his behavior. However, Umi is very dedicated to Hikaru and Fuu, wanting nothing more than to save Cephiro and return home. She uses water-based spells called Water Dragon and Azure Hurricane. In the anime Umi is totally clueless of Ascot's affections for her and she has feelings for Clef but he seems not to be too interested in love. She's friends with Tatra and Tarta, the princesses of Chizeta, whom she defeated in sword fights at different points in the second season. During the same arc, Umi appears to be slightly more mature. In the manga, she is apparently a fan of Häagen-Dazs ice cream, Denny's and MOS Burger (she becomes panicked at the thought that Cephiro does not have any of these – similar to Miaka Yūki in Fushigi Yûgi, who, upon hers and her best friend's arrival at another world, complains about the absence of her favourite restaurants). The brand names were removed from the anime dialogue, presumably to avoid copyright infringement. Her lovestory in the manga is very different, she develops a very close relationship with Ascot who blushes whenever they are together. Although she doesn't realize Ascot's feelings she has a more proactive attitude with him offering and asking him for help on several occasions. They seem to have a special affinity and Mokona shows us that there is a connection between them. It is strongly implied that there is a budding relationship between Umi and Ascot near the end of the story. A relationship with Clef is non-existent in the manga. Curiously, her parents have a minor cameo in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, another Clamp series that has many crossovers. In some language adaptations, her name was changed to Marina and Marine. , Amy Birnbaum (English) in OVA. Fuu Hououji has snapping green eyes and short blonde hair (light brown in the anime) and wears glasses, except when in full armour (Fuu is notably the only Magic Knight whose hair and eyes do not share the same color base). She is more quiet and reserved than the other two members of the group and serves as the voice of reason. Along with specializing in archery, she is also highly intelligent and logical, though this is more akin to book-smarts than street-smarts. Fuu often states the obvious and is very blunt in a fairly humorous way, much to Umi's dismay in some situations. Fuu deeply believes that her belief, along with Hikaru's and Umi's, is her strength in saving Cephiro. She often has moments where she doubts herself, but comes out strong and resolved in the end. Her spells, Winds of Protection, Winds of Admonishment, and Winds of Healing, are air-based and are mostly healing and defensive in nature, though she has some offensive attacks, such as Emerald Typhoon and Emerald Cyclone. Fuu is in love with Ferio, the estranged brother of Princess Emeraude, who has been helping them since they met in the beginning of the first series. In the second arc, she grows closer to Ferio, and though she is torn knowing she helped kill his sister, his feelings for her never waver. In the second season, Fuu wins an archery contest against Lady Aska, after which they become friends. Fuu is very polite and calls people Sir or Miss (-san in the Japanese version). Fuu also has an older sister named Kuu. In some language adaptations, her name was changed to Anemone and Anne. , Lisa Ortiz (English) in OVA. Characters of the first season=Clef is the chief of all sorcerers in Cephiro, and was formerly Princess Emeraude's attendant. In the anime, he is turned to stone by Zagato shortly after being introduced to the three girls in the first episode, although he fights the spell and communicated with them through Mokona. In the manga he is referred to as Guru Clef and is not turned to stone. In the second arc he also leads all of Cephiro until a new pillar can be found. In episode 48, he used all his willpower to create a castle to hold the castle from further collapsing. In the manga Clef is often seen with Presea, but nothing special is ever mentioned between them. In the anime he is both loved by Sierra and the deceased Presea. When he first meet the girls, he reacts very unpleasantly to Umi who called him a \\"child\\" or 10 years old as stated by Umi; when in fact, he is actually 745 years old. In season 2 of the anime, it was hinted that he cares for Umi when she got abducted by the Twin Princess but he never showed a love interested for her. His name is derived from the Mazda Clef. , Immy Uncle (English) in OVA. Mokona is a mischievous, nonsensical rabbit-like creature, possibly a Carbuncle, with a striking similarity to a white manjū bun, with a red gem in his forehead above his eyes. From this gem he can produce a tent for the girls to sleep in, food, and other necessary supplies. He is unable to speak, aside from repeating the sound \\"puu\\", although Hikaru seems to be somewhat able to understand him. In the manga, Mokona is revealed to be the Creator of the Earth, Cephiro and the other planets, as well as the laws for each planet. In the ending of the second arc, Mokona and the rest of the Mashin announce that they will be traveling to other dimensions. Mokona of Rayearth is a separate character from Mokona Modoki from ×××HOLiC and Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-, though Yūko implies that those Mokonas were based on Cephiro's Mokona, and saying she might not have known about other worlds if she hadn't met him. Mokona was named after Mokona, one of Clamp's artists. . Ferio is a warrior whom the Magic Knights first meet in the Forest of Silence. A tough young man wielding a sword taller than he is, he quickly develops a soft spot for Fuu and the feelings grow to love near the end of the first arc but by the second season his feelings have evolved into a strong love for Fuu. Never completely honest with others, he made himself difficult for the heroines to trust. In the anime he gives Fuu a jeweled orb. Since he has one identical to it, he uses it to communicate with her throughout the first series. In the manga series, he gives her a ring identical to the one on his ear. Fuu loses it when the three go home to Tokyo in the first series, but in the second series, when they return, he gives it to her for a second time. Both items were given to him by his older sister Princess Emeraude in his youth. In the anime's first season, Ferio once pretended to join Ascot, Lord Zagato's child summoner, who set a trap for the Magic Knights using his sound-sensitive monster, Pajero. Also, while the Magic Knights are facing Inouva's true form, Ferio regains his memory from his younger years. He realizes that he was Princess Emeraude's only brother, and hears his sister's voice coming from his own orb telling him how to defeat Inouva. Ferio relays the info to the Knights and they manage to kill their enemy. In the manga Ferio knows of his origins and meets the Magic Knights on his way to try and save his sister, using his fighting skills in exchange for passage out of a forest he had become lost in. In the OVA, he is initially a villain who can summon and control swarms of insects. He appears to have a close relationship with Ascot, and in a twist of his original character, he is the villain who does battle with Fuu. After eavesdropping on Lantis' conversation with Hikaru and the others, he assists Lantis in fighting Cephiro's spirits, and later delivers Lantis' sword to the combined Mashin to help them fight Eagle. Ferio gets his name from the Honda Civic Ferio, and Ascot's monster from the episode featuring Ferio is named after the Mitsubishi Pajero. , Jim Ensz (English) in OVA. Presea is the top blacksmith in Cephiro, known there as a Pharle or \\"artisan\\". She is one of Clef's students and seems to have a crush on him. She aided the Magic Knights by making their legendary swords from the mineral escudo. In both the anime and manga series, she shows something of a sadistic side, plotting ways to punish Mokona for making a mess in her study (including yanking his ears, hanging him upside- down while she dances about him dressed as a Native American, and prying his ever-closed eyes wide open). Her trap captures the Magic Knights by mistake, so she ponders whether to stretch their cheeks or boil them in a big pot, again wearing a feathered headdress and doing a war dance. In the anime series, she is killed by one of Ascot's beast summons. This death happens only in the anime, and unfortunately created a plot hole for the second season when Presea becomes a necessary character in the manga counterpart. In order to fill this plot hole, her twin sister, Sierra, is created to pose as her. The only ones to realize that Sierra is not Presea are Clef, Mokona, and Alcyone, who recognizes Sierra's deception as stemming partly from her love for Clef. When Clef confronts Sierra about why she is posing as her sister, Sierra replies that it is to help the Knights with their mission and continue her sister's legacy, but does not reveal her own feelings for him. Presea's favorite food is listed as V-tek, a kind of candy from Cephiro (though she enjoys the candy from Earth that Hikaru gives her as payment for using her weapons). Named after the Nissan Presea. . Alcyone is an ice sorceress who tutored under Clef and was intended to attend to the Pillar. However, she fell in love with the high priest, Zagato, and for this love became his servant, although the affection is entirely one-sided. In the manga she is killed after failing Zagato twice by his own hand. In the anime she lives on until near the end of the second season; moments after Zagato and Emeraude's deaths, she's captured by the evil witch Debonair, who brainwashes her into becoming her slave. Lantis captures Alcyone in battle, but she has lost her memories. When she recovers them, she reveals Debonair's plans for Cephiro and Debonair's location, and is killed shortly after by Debonair for her betrayal. In the Sega Saturn game, Alcyone is apparently killed by Lafarga. She survives despite her injuries and, after realizing that Zagato loves Emeraude, Alcyone loses her sanity and dies fighting the Magic Knights one last time. Her name is occasionally misromanized as \\"Alcione\\" – this was featured in the first run of the English-language manga. Her name comes from the Subaru Alcyone SVX. , Angora Deb (English) in OVA. Ascot One of the followers of Zagato, is a young child with the ability to summon monsters, whom he considers to be his friends. Although hideous, they have no ill will, but villagers still fear them. Homeless and without parents, Ascot was never well received anywhere with his monsters until Zagato offered to give him and his friends a home in exchange for serving under him. Consumed by hatred and loneliness, his heart is full of selfish feelings reflected in a poor image and attitude of evil and cruel child. His real age is unknown so we don't know if Ascot is really a child and it's possible that his physical appearance is produced by the poverty of his soul and the lack of affection. In the anime he destroys Presea's house with his monsters, and essentially causes her death. Later, he confronts the Knights again but Umi slaps him for using his friends and causing them pain. This causes a change of heart in Ascot, he learns the true meaning of friendship and he then forsakes Zagato. In the second series, his appearance changes, now he is a tall and nice young man who has managed to grow thanks to the lessons learned in the past, the power of his will and the love he feels for Umi. Now his behavior is calm and sweet towards people. While he still summons monsters, he has learned other spells from Clef to avoid using his friends as living weapons. He is able to tell Umi his feelings before she leaves to fight Tarta & Tatra. Umi replies that she loves him as well, but just as much as everyone else in Cephiro, and that she didn't have any romantic feelings for him. This saddens Ascot a bit, but he still continues to try and win her heart. In the manga, his story is similar to the anime in the first season, he starts as an evil child who changes thanks to Umi's lessons, the only change is that he never kills Presea. In the second season, he becomes in a tall young man as well for the same reasons described above. He decide to use his own magic instead of the \\"summoning magic\\" to avoid hurting his monsters and to learn how to fend for himself. Even though he never confesses his feelings to Umi, he gets Umi's affection much more than in the anime. They are closer and always smile when they are together, even Mokona shows us that there is a special connection between them. It is strongly implied that there is a budding relationship between Umi and Ascot near the end of the story so it is a more fortunate relationship than in the anime. He is named after the Honda Ascot. . Caldina (changed to Gardina in Tokyopop's manga) is a dancer who speaks with an Osaka accent (which is translated as a deep Southern accent in the English dub, due to the translations including words like \\"y'all\\"), wears extremely skimpy clothing because her body is too sexy to be covered, and has an endless passion for money. Zagato hires her as an assassin after his other minions fail; in addition to her dancing skills, she is an accomplished illusionist and hypnotist. In the anime she has great affection for Ascot, whom she treats as a naïve younger brother, and she joins him in deserting Zagato. It is revealed in the second arc and season that she is native to Chizeta. It's also been shown that Caldina is incredibly good at cards and other games of chance. Caldina hypnotizes people by making the red jewels on her gloves, earrings and shoes flash and send out bell sounds. Romantically, Caldina becomes involved with Lafarga in both versions of the series. Caldina also appears in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle as a bartender. Her name comes from the Toyota Caldina. . Lafarga (Rafarga) is the Captain of the Guard and charged with protecting the Pillar. Although Cephiro is mostly peaceful, he kept himself busy slaying the occasional monsters that would appear. In his takeover of the country, Zagato hypnotized him into trying to kill the Magic Knights as a last-ditch effort to stop them before they challenged him personally, but the girls managed to bring him to his senses. He goes against Zagato roughly at the same time Hikaru must meet Rayearth, and she in fact manages to summon her Mashin while trying to help Lafarga fight Zagato. In the second part of the story, he is romantically involved with Caldina. While he possesses no magical ability, he is a devastatingly powerful swordsman. Named after the Honda Rafaga, a sister car of the Ascot. . Inouva is an anime-and-game-only character sporting an elven appearance and manner. He was a devoted servant of Zagato's—in fact, a birthday present from Emeraude to her High Priest. Inouva is not humanoid as he appears, but an animal-shaped elemental of lightning who assumed a human form to better serve his new master. His true form resembles a giant wolf with two tendrils streaming from his back. His weak spot proved to be the gemstone embedded in his forehead in either form. He first challenged the Magic Knights in the Sky Shrine, and would have defeated them if not for Windam's revival. He later resumed his true form and was destroyed by Hikaru. In the Spanish version of the anime he's known as Nova, which is also the name of Hikaru's darker half in the original source material. His name comes from the Honda Ascot Innova. . Emeraude is the current pillar (and princess) of Cephiro. Little else is revealed concerning her nature until the climax of the first series, although she is highly loved by her subjects. In the anime it is revealed that she was once a noblewoman of Cephiro, and had later used her power as the Pillar to prevent her younger brother Ferio from being punished for stealing something from her. He had forgotten she was his sister because, at his own request, she had used her magic to help him forget about her so he would not miss her or feel sorrow, and asked that she in turn forget him, so that she could focus her thoughts and prayers only on Cephiro. In the manga series, she is Ferio's older sister as well, but there is no mention of Ferio stealing something from her, and he does remember that she is his sister; in fact, he left the palace on his own will. The Pillar of Cephiro must spend every waking moment of their existence praying for Cephiro's benefit, and when Princess Emeraude fell in love with Zagato the High Priest, she was constantly thinking of him and not Cephiro, and eventually imprisoned herself in a water dungeon (resembling a large peony in an underwater cavern beneath Zagato's court in her own palace) in hopes of being able to focus on only Cephiro. When she is unable to do so, she summons the Magic Knights. Zagato, who had in turn fallen in love with her, discovered Princess Emeraude's true feelings for him and visits her often, telling her that he does not care for the fate of Cephiro, and that there was only one thing in the world that he cared about – Emeraude herself. Believing if he destroyed the Magic Knights, he would be able to keep Emeraude safe and that by sheer will everything would turn out all right, he sent his minions one by one, each one failing to carry out the task. When the Magic Knights awaken the Rune Gods and arrive at the palace, Zagato is waiting for them. He confronts them in a Rune God he created with his own will to kill them and protect Emeraude, intent on making his one desire come true. But the Magic Knights emerge triumphant and kill Zagato. Emeraude, devastated by the loss of her beloved, collapses under the tremendous weight of her own guilt and grief. Transforming into an older- and more sinister-looking version of herself, she breaks free from the water prison. This form is only filled with anger and pure hatred for the Magic Knights for killing Zagato, forgetting it was she who summoned them in the first place. Zagato's court begins to fall apart beneath her anger, and she dons her own Mashin and grabs Zagato's fallen sword. She begins to fight the Magic Knights in their Mashin, and they see fleeting visions of the real Emeraude who tells them of her plight and how she has realized that it would be better if she died than tried to rule Cephiro with a heart tainted with grief and regret. No one of Cephiro is allowed to kill the Pillar and the Pillar cannot will itself to die, so the \\"girls from another world\\" (the Magic Knights) are there solely for that purpose: to don the Mashin and kill the current Pillar of Cephiro, as death is the only way for the Pillar to abandon their duty. The Knights resist at first, but tearfully give in when Emeraude begs them to send her to \\"where she may think only of Zagato\\" and be with him. Emeraude dies, using the last of her power to send them home to the exact moment they disappeared from Tokyo Tower. The last image of her they see is her purified adult self in Zagato's arms, smiling sweetly and thanking the Knights for granting her last wish. It has been speculated that Princess Emeraude was based on The Childlike Empress from Michael Ende's The Neverending Story (Die unendliche Geschichte), being as they are both directly linked to their kingdom (if one should die, so shall their empire), they both do not play a direct role despite the fact that their powers are the most revered, and they are both depicted as young women, no older than the age of ten to thirteen. Furthermore, though they are both young in appearance, they are both considered \\"ageless\\". Lastly, their stories, though different in ways, are also similar. Recalling the fact that Emeraude sent for earthlings to kill her (for no one in Cephiro could do her harm), The Childlike Empress sent for a human boy, for no one in her kingdom of Fantasia could give her a new name. Also the Proof of the Pillar which took the form of Emeraude's tiara could also be related to The Childlike Empress' AURYN, which was the symbol of her absolute power in Fantasia. Sometimes known as Princess Esmerald or Esmeralda, and misnamed Princess Emerald in the official English translation of the Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle manga. She gets her name from the Mitsubishi Emeraude. . Zagato is the primary antagonist of the first season, his younger brother is Cail Lantis (introduced in the second arc and season). When he is first introduced, he is seen as a terrible villain who has kidnapped the beloved Princess Emeraude, watching cruelly as Cephiro crumbles without its Pillar. However, this image is far from the truth. High Priest to Princess Emeraude and Clef's right-hand man, Zagato fell deeply in love with the beautiful and kind Princess. Despite her best efforts to put Cephiro first and foremost, Princess Emeraude fell in love with Zagato as well. When Emeraude goes missing, Zagato came forth as having had kidnapped Princess Emeraude. In reality, Emeraude was so upset by her lack of will that she imprisoned herself in the water dungeon to avoid seeing Zagato. Zagato does not reveal this to the Magic Knights or Cephiro's people, aiming to destroy the knights when they come after him. The reason Zagato is this way is because of his deep love for Emeraude and equally deep hate for Cephiro's Pillar System. The Pillar must devote every moment of their existence to praying for Cephiro and never seek happiness from anything except seeing the planet prosper. Zagato was tormented to see Emeraude chained down as such and even more so when she had to resist the love that had grown between them. He decides that instead of Emeraude returning as the Pillar and continuing to be a slave to Cephiro, he would rather have Cephiro cease to exist. In the end of the first season, he is killed in battle by the Magic Knights in a final attempt to protect Emeraude; his last words tell her to \\"be free\\". His death caused Emeraude to become lost in her own grief and rage, causing her to also be killed by the Magic Knights, who were only forced to. Zagato is the name of an Italian automotive design studio. . The Three Mashin (Rune Gods) The Three Mashin (Rune Gods) are the three legendary guardians of Cephiro. Umi's is Selece (as transliterated in the original manga artwork by CLAMP - also known as Ceres, Seles, or Celes in some translated versions), who first appears as a large blue dragon. Fuu's is Windam (Windom in the official English release of the manga), a great four-winged bird. Finally, Hikaru's is Rayearth (Lexus in the OVA series), a wolf with a mane of fire. The three are old and ancient, and are in fact mecha used by the Magic Knights to help them combat Zagato and ultimately kill the Pillar. The three Mashin are able to combine into a greater and much stronger Mashin (unnamed by the authors, but sometimes named by the fanbase as \\"Combined Rayearth\\" or \\"Big Rayearth\\"). In the OVA, the combined mashin is named Rayearth. The \\"Rune God\\" name was only used in the official English release of the anime series. \\"Mashin\\" has a bit of a double-meaning; it is katakana for the English word \\"machine\\", but is a homonym of the Japanese word for \\"evil spirit\\", \\"magical spirit\\", or \\"demon god\\". They also feature as \\"Kudan\\" (a kind of protective spirit) in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, also by Clamp. Rayearth is assigned to Syaoran, Celes to Kurogane and Windam to Fay. In the ending of the second and final part of the series, Mokona and the rest of the Mashin declare that they will be travelling to other universes. Voiced by: Lex Lang (Rayearth), Terrence Stone (Selece), Lex Lang (Windam). Characters of the second season=Lantis , Zagato's younger brother, is a powerful Cail or Kailu (magic swordsman) who journeyed abroad for a great deal of time and returned to Cephiro after meeting Eagle in Autozam. Lantis has made his first appearance in season two when he returned to Cephiro. He desired to remove the Pillar System in order to prevent the tragedy and pain that Zagato and Princess Emeraude had experienced. He is regarded with suspicion due to his reclusive nature. Nevertheless, Hikaru approaches him, though at first it's because she feels extreme guilt about killing his brother. Though his intimidating manner can be off-putting, he is gentle at heart; in fact, he forgives Hikaru and the other Knights for Zagato's death. In the anime version he falls in love with Hikaru, which she reciprocates, while in the manga there are only hints of any romance between the two. At the end of the manga, Lantis asks Hikaru how people of Earth convey love. When she explains that they usually marry, Lantis asks if there is anyone she'd like to marry, to which Hikaru replies that she'd like to marry everyone as she loves them all. Lantis also appears in Tsubasa. His name comes from the Mazda Lantis. , Dan Stevens (English) in OVA. Primera is a fairy who has acted as Lantis's guardian ever since he saved her from a monster attack. She's very jealous and possessive of Lantis, and thus harbors a deep dislike for Hikaru. From the start, Mokona likes to tease Primera, causing her to greatly dislike Mokona. When Hikaru and Lantis start to become friendly with each other, she pops up to stop them out of jealousy, but Mokona either chases her away or eats her and later spits her out. She can use low- level healing magic when necessary. Primera makes an appearance in Tsubasa in the Hanshin Republic and is later mentioned in the country of Piffle, by Shogo Asagi. Rather than being tiny, she is the size of a normal human. She is named after the Nissan Primera. Sierra is an anime-only character. She is Presea's identical twin sister, and the only way to tell them apart is by the feather-shaped birthmark on Sierra's chest (first noted by Caldina when all the girls are bathing together). She makes her appearance throughout the anime's second season, corresponding with Presea's presence in the manga. Sierra pretends to be Presea to alleviate a portion of the pain of the Magic Knights, who blame themselves for not being able to help Presea, and of Ascot, who blames himself for killing Presea. Clef falsely tells the Magic Knights that Princess Emeraude made a wish to revive all the people who died while she was imprisoned, though in truth no one can revive a life once it is lost. Sierra is in love with Clef, as was Presea, though her love is one-sided (Alcyone confirms this after learning of Sierra's true identity). She cannot make weapons out of Escudo, but she can help revive the weapons once they are lost; she did this to help Hikaru regain her sword after Nova broke it. She is named after the Ford Sierra. Eagle Vision is a well-known and respected commander from Cephiro's neighboring country, Autozam, a technologically advanced world reliant on the mental energy of its citizens for its power. It is clear right away that Eagle is an enigmatic and forceful tactician, and though a gentle and chivalrous gentleman, he is the leader of Autozam's invasion of Cephiro. He is also the son of the President of Autozam. When Lantis visited Autozam during his travels, he and Eagle became best friends. Eagle comes to Cephiro with hopes of duplicating the Pillar System back on his home world, and also wishes to actually become the Pillar for personal reasons. Eagle is in fact very sick and wasn't even supposed to be alive by the time he made it to Cephiro. Eagle reveals to Hikaru that he wants to become the Pillar to spare Lantis' life and be in an eternal sleep with Cephiro. In the end, Hikaru tells him it is unfair of him to leave all his loved ones behind and saves him, bringing him back to Cephiro and starting him on the road to restoring his health. In the anime, however, Eagle sacrifices himself in order to save the Magic Knights. It is unknown what happened to Autozam after his death, but in manga, Autozam becomes an allied country of Cephiro. In the OVA he is Emeraude's brother and does his best to keep his sister happy. This includes trying to destroy the Earth because he's certain that's what his sister wants. Eagle also appears in Tsubasa alongside comrades Lantis and Geo. He is named after the Eagle Vision, and the FTO (mecha he pilots) is named after the Mitsubishi FTO. Autozam is named after a line of Mazda cars, Autozam. , Adam Masterelli (English) in OVA. Geo Metro is the second-in-command of the Autozam invasion of Cephiro. Muscular and good- natured, loyal and over-protective, he acts much like an older brother to Eagle Vision and has a weakness for sweets. He is featured with Eagle in Tsubasa. Named after the Geo Metro. His mecha, the GTO, is named after the Mitsubishi GTO. Zazu Torque is the mechanic of Eagle's forces and is quite short for a teenager. He wishes to have a girlfriend and he is fascinated with all kinds of machinery. As a mechanic, he can fix anything from microwaves to mechas. He likes to drink alcohol and also has a strong taste for sweets. Zazu is friends with Geo, Eagle and Lantis. Zazu shares his name with ZAZ from Ukraine. He is often portrayed as having a crush on Hikaru. Lady Aska of Fahren is the First Princess of the country of Fahren and the head of the Fahren invasion force that attacks Cephiro. Her ship is the Dome, an immense dragon-shaped vessel. She laughs constantly and arrogantly, and tends to refer to herself as \\"we\\" instead of \\"I\\". She is very young, self- assured and appears fairly bratty (she wants Cephiro so her every whim will become reality, and in the anime version she wants to become pretty to impress Sanyun), but can use all the legendary forbidden spells of the Royal Family, including the ability to conjure up creatures that she draws on ceremonial paper that she uses to attack with. In the anime series, Aska looks up to Fuu as a sort of heroine; this relationship is non-existent in the manga, as Fuu doesn't spend time on their ship. Aska later decides not to rule Cephiro because Fuu (Eagle in the manga) told her that the Pillar can think only of Cephiro, but since Lady Aska loves the people of Fahren, she cannot complete the task of Pillar in Cephiro. She gave this same reasoning when she decided to concede invading Cephiro in the manga. Her face looks like that of Meiling Li of Cardcaptor Sakura. Named after the Isuzu Aska. Fahren also happens to be the German word for \\"driving.\\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english-german/driving Sanyun is Aska's loyal servant and childhood friend. He's much more thoughtful and studious than Aska (though he really doesn't look it) and hopes to one day assist her in ruling Fahren. In the manga, there are slight implications of a relationship between Aska and Sanyun. He makes a short appearance in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle as the Kudan of Masayoshi Saitou, and again in this form in the Country of Ōto, working for Chang Ang in a sword shop. He shares his name with the SsangYong Motor Company of South Korea. Chang Ang is a Fahren cabinet member and current ruler of the realm until Aska comes of age. He puts a lot of pressure on Aska to become a good ruler, which causes her to think of him as a \\"preachy old man\\"; in the English version, a \\"bigmouth\\". In the manga Chang Ang assists Lady Aska in her invasion of Cephiro. Throughout the second story arc, he constantly loses his temper with her because of her rash actions and silly decisions. Chang Ang also makes an appearance in Tsubasa in the Country of Ōto. He shares his name with the Chinese car manufacturer Changan Automobile. Tarta is the hot- headed princess of the planet Chizeta, which sends its forces to conquer Cephiro and expand its territory. She is especially good at sword combat and can summon the djinn Rakoon. She wants to rule Cephiro as the Pillar to give a better life quality to the people of Chizeta, since their planet is too small. In the anime, she has a friendly rivalry with Umi; when each of the Magic Knights are taken to one of the invading countries, she and her sister face Umi aboard their battleship. Tarta shares her name with the Tata Motors from India. Tatra is Tarta's calm and seemingly airheaded older twin sister who, when focused, is in fact a formidable warrior. She can conjure the djinn Rasheen to do her bidding and go into battle for her, or choose to use a whip against her enemies. According to Tarta, Tatra is in fact the best fighter in Chizeta. Tatra shares her name with the Tatra auto manufacturer from the Czech Republic. Nova is introduced as the daughter of Lady Debonair and is an anime-only villainess, able to use Hikaru's attacks as her own while using the Mashin Regalia. She is rather slender with pink hair and elf ears, and appears to be close in age to the three heroines. Throughout the series, Nova gives the impression of being an unstable character, often switching between expressing affection and giving death threats in the space of a heartbeat. Most of her schemes involve capturing Hikaru, whom she obsessively loves enough to kill while expressing distain towards those Hikaru cares for. Nova is eventually revealed to be a fragment of Hikaru's soul that broke off from Hikaru's inability to cope with killing Emeraude and became a separate being, unknowingly left behind on Cephiro. While Nova searched for Hikaru, she was instead found by Debobair and is manipulated into her service. But once Nova learned the truth that Debonair only used her, she loses against Hikaru and willingly merged back into her after Hikaru admitted that Nova's creation might have been her subconscious attempt to overcome her self-loathing over Emeraude's death. Nova's character was created by Toshihiro Hirano. She was originally one of his characters from a different anime that was never realized and produced. She is named after the Chevrolet Nova. Debonair , an anime-only character, is the head antagonist of the second season who awaits the day when Cephiro will crumble due to lack of support from Princess Emeraude. Debonair is ultimately revealed to be an embodiment of the collective darkness within the hearts of Cephiro's citizens, thus possessing tremendous power with a desire to rule over Cephiro. She is not present in the manga, which instead focuses on the battles between Cephiro and the three invading countries of Autozam, Fahren, and Chizeta. She gets her name from the Mitsubishi Debonair. An alternate version of her appears in Tsubasa as the Kiishim.

The station is located in the northwest of Newry, County Armagh on the Dublin-Belfast line close to the Craigmore Viaduct. The station originally opened in 1855 as Newry Main Line,http://www.poyntzpass.co.uk/Lissummon_Tunnel/page12.pdf renamed Bessbrook & Newry Main Line in 1866, renamed again as Bessbrook in 1880 before closing in 1942. It was re-opened in 1984 as an NIR Intercity station, with basic facilities such as a temporary booking office. These facilities remained in place for over 20 years from the station's opening by which time their condition was deteriorating. In order to improve facilities for passengers a modern new station building was constructed and opened on 7 September 2009.  Service  The station is a calling point on the Enterprise express service, which operates between and . These trains call at Newry for both destinations at two-hour intervals throughout the day. The station experiences favourable passenger numbers from this service. There are also four trains to and from Bangor, operated by Northern Ireland Railways. On Sundays, there are five Enterprise trains in each direction, and no NIR services. Additionally, two peak time services are operated to and from Newry by Iarnród Éireann, with the first one being the 06:30 service to Dublin Connolly, calling at Commuter stations between Newry and Dublin Connolly except Gormanston, Portmarnock, Clongriffin, and Howth Junction. The first peak service to Newry started in January 2018, with the 17:13 service from Dublin Pearse being extended to Newry from Dundalk.

In general, it can be interpreted as the difference between the time of arrival of the earliest significant multipath component (typically the line-of-sight component) and the time of arrival of the last multipath components. The delay spread is mostly used in the characterization of wireless channels, but it also applies to any other multipath channel (e.g. multipath in optical fibers). Delay spread can be quantified through different metrics, although the most common one is the root mean square (rms) delay spread. Denoting the power delay profile of the channel by A_c(\\\\tau), the mean delay of the channel is :\\\\overline{\\\\tau}=\\\\frac{\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\tau A_c(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau}{\\\\int_0^\\\\infty A_c(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau} and the rms delay spread is given by :\\\\tau_{\\\\text{rms}}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\int_0^\\\\infty(\\\\tau-\\\\overline{\\\\tau})^2 A_c(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau}{\\\\int_0^\\\\infty A_c(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau}} The formula above is also known as the root of the second central moment of the normalised delay power density spectrum The importance of delay spread is how it affects the Inter Symbol Interference (ISI). If the symbol duration is long enough compared to the delay spread (typically 10 times as big would be good enough), one can expect an equivalent ISI-free channel. The correspondence with the frequency domain is the notion of coherence bandwidth (CB), which is the bandwidth over which the channel can be assumed flat(i.e. channel that passes all spectral components with approximately equal gain and linear phase.). Coherence bandwidth is related to the inverse of the delay spread. The shorter the delay spread, the larger is the coherence bandwidth. Delay spread has a significant impact on Intersymbol interference.

The programme contains reviews of current shows, as well as stories and commentary on how television is produced. Format Screenwipe is presented by comedian Charlie Brooker, who reviews other British television programmes with a caustic and humorous tone. Brooker analyses specific programmes and genres, regularly making jokes about how programmes are created. Brooker often pays particular attention to more obscure channels on satellite, Freeview and cable, such as those dedicated to gambling, shopping, horoscopes and pornography. He explores the probable effects of television on society and the feelings programmes can create in the viewer. One segment of each show is usually dedicated to positive reviews, with analysis on why the style and content are so absorbing. Much of the programme is filmed in Brooker's living room, with shots of him sitting in front of his TV (and laptop) with remote control in hand talking to camera, occasionally bellowing insults or sarcastic comments at whatever happens to be shown at the time, interspersed with shots of TV shows. Occasionally he will make use of props for the sake of humour, including a \\"seance trumpet\\" to mock Colin Fry's performance and an oven glove with a smiley face into which he claims to channel his unfulfilled emotions. When not in the living room, Brooker presents segments on various pieces of television, different genres or peculiarities of production. Instead of actors, these sections often feature members of the Screenwipe production crew to illustrate points; for example, director Al Campbell as the half-witted satirist \\"Barry Shitpeas\\", and researcher Mike Bradley in a number of roles. The series has spawned several spin-off shows which use a very similar format but examine different media: Newswipe with Charlie Brooker, Charlie Brooker's Gameswipe, and Charlie Brooker's Weekly Wipe. Episodes The first full series finished with an extended edition on US television billed as Screenwipe USA. A Christmas special was broadcast on 21 December 2006 and a review of the year 2006 special was broadcast on 31 December 2006. A third series 'with a massively increased budget' (according to a spoof voiceover at the end of the final episode from the second series), was revealed to have been commissioned on 9 May 2007. The third series was preceded by a mini-Screenwipe on 12 May (shown on BBC Two's The Culture Show), which reviewed Grease is the Word and Any Dream Will Do. Shortly after the third series concluded, a Screenwipe clip show was shown on BBC Two, with repeats of the series airing on the channel in the weeks following. The third series featured a number of episodes focusing on specific themes, such as television news coverage and reality television series. The fifth series of Screenwipe began airing on BBC Four on Tuesday 18 November 2008. The first episode dealt with (among other things) Manuelgate and television production costs (and the effect of the credit crunch on said costs). The second was focused on the changes in television advertising throughout its history, and the third was an extended edition composed entirely of Brooker's interviews with prestigious writers such as Russell T Davies and Tony Jordan. Episode four focused on \\"mission shows\\" such as The Great British Body, and featured a parody involving \\"pee-shyness\\" (paruresis), while episode five focused on children's programming through the ages. The final episode of the season was a review of 2008. In 2009, the show didn't return for another series, but a review of the year was scheduled as had been the case with previous years. Style The humour of the show is usually based on sarcasm and cutting remarks, in a similar style to Harry Hill's TV Burp, or The Soup. Screenwipe can be characterised as being intellectually more harsh with Brooker often making surreal moral comparisons between the so- called 'real-world attitude' of certain programmes, and the logical conclusions of that attitude if it were turned towards real life. It often forms the basis for analysis of programmes - such as his review of the ITV musical drama Britannia High in which he describes the characters as \\"irritating show-offs\\" and that the school which they inhabit \\"in any sane world would have its windows bricked up by the government before the self- satisfied inmates could get out and infect the rest of the population.\\" Brooker is known to be critical of reality television shows such as Big Brother and The X Factor, and often makes scathing remarks about the sort of people who watch these shows. One example in the 2008 Christmas Special involved a remark about X Factor winner Alexandra Burke's cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\", which Brooker went on to claim is now \\"ruined forever as a song destined to be played at thick people's funerals\\". Brooker often displays archive footage of various shows, but alters the viewer's perception through near stream-of-consciousness narration and/or ironic juxtaposition with contrasting footage or sound, e.g. highlighting what he believes is the organised crime feel of a scene from Dragons' Den by running the trumpet solo from The Godfather over the original dialogue. He has also been known to make jokes at the expense of his own show and himself, in particular making light of his resemblance to Laurence Fishburne, and in the first episode of the third series he claimed he had \\"a face like a paedophile walrus\\". Also of note was the deliberate mention of Victor Lewis-Smith, described by the 'TV Insider' being interviewed (and presumably written by Brooker) as \\"kind of like a rich man's you\\". Lewis-Smith co-wrote and presented a similar show in the late nineties called TV Offal which Brooker sarcastically and knowingly claims to have no knowledge of. Despite his derogatory and insulting remarks aimed at many television shows, people, and near enough everything and everyone, Brooker does show his happier side and has spoken of his liking for certain US drama series including The Shield; Deadwood; The Wire; Mad Men; and the most recent version of Battlestar Galactica; as well as the current series of Doctor Who; and older documentary programmes such as Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man, Civilisation, and The World at War. Brooker singles out Bronowski for praise regarding his style of presentation describing it as 'a bit like taking a warm bath in university juice'. In a more solemn example, at the end of an episode screened in December 2008, Brooker paid tribute to children's programmes creator Oliver Postgate, who had died the day before the programme was aired. Brooker often makes a point of laying light praise upon unlikely targets, such as Milkshake, Five's morning programmes aimed at pre- school age children, stating, \\"There isn't a single piece of negativity in the whole thing and that's what you need at this time in the morning.\\"  Annual Wipe  From 2006 to 2016, the BBC broadcast an Annual Wipe. From 2017 onwards, there was no Annual Wipe due to Brooker's other commitments, with a Frankie Boyle's New World Order Review Of The Year filling the vacant gap. At the end of the decade on 30 December 2019, BBC Two broadcast a 90-minute compilation show entitled \\"The Best of 2010-2015 Wipe with Charlie Brooker\\" followed by a repeat of the final 2016 Wipe. In May 2020, BBC Two broadcast \\"Charlie Brooker's Antiviral Wipe\\", a 45-minute programme in the style of the Annual Wipes, focusing on the news coverage of, and public reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Animations  The show is also notable for using animations produced by internet animator David Firth. To date the show has used eight of Firth's original creations. The 2006 Christmas Special featured a special appearance from Firth's deranged alter-ego, Jerry Jackson, whose cartoon appeared substituting for an animation that Firth had created beforehand. This original animation was rejected by the BBC on the grounds that it was far too offensive to be broadcast on TV. Firth recently announced on his website that the BBC had asked him to produce an animation for each episode of the second series of Screenwipe. Three were shown but the fourth, a Jerry Jackson cartoon, was once again rejected by the BBC. Firth stated in a post on Fat-Pie.com that \\"Jerry's [cartoon] was about Political Correctness on TV and contained a certain degree of sarcasm, yet sarcasm the TV company didn't see the funny side of, and they refused to use it\\". The third series saw Firth produce four more short animations (of which three were aired) entitled 'The World Within A Sock', in which a group known as The Establishment buys the year 2008.

Pike to help with the teaching of translation techniques. Each sentence in Kalaba-X has a fixed structure, consisting of three sentence parts: verb, object, subject, or more exactly, predicate (affirmation or assertion of a general status fact or occurring event), object (that indicates or restricts where the action applies or takes place, or allows qualifying it more precisely), subject (any triggering condition under which the fact can occur, and without which the predicate would not have occurred). Under such definition, the grammatical structure of other languages can be more easily compared to each other, using Kalaba-X as a formal intermediate language for studying the language semantic (for example, this theoretical model does not define a grammatical difference between a noun and a verb, or between a verb and an adjective, as it is found in most European languages, because most nouns or adjectives of European languages can also be a predicate by themselves). Each of these three parts, which are linked semantically rather than grammatically, can be modified. By focusing on the semantic rather than the grammatical structure of the source or target language, this constructed language can be used as an intermediate tool for producing better translations, notably between languages that have very different grammatical structures and where the semantic is organized differently into one or more subordinated sentences. For example, the English sentence \\"This picture is very beautiful.\\" would be structured in Kalaba-X as if it were written \\"Beautiful very, picture this, me.\\" where the subject (me) is explicitly given in Kalaba-X rather than being subjectively implied by the context. Under such translation, the effective semantic of the sentence is \\"I (find that) this picture is very beautiful.\\" where the author of the sentence is responsible for this affirmation. The English grammar may hide the fact that the \\"beautiful\\" adjective translates the concept of \\"enjoying\\", a true verb, so a simpler Kalaba-X sentence would be better \\"Enjoy a lot, picture this, me.\\" But the analysis does not stop there, because Kalaba-X features no pronouns, i.e. no ambiguous substitutes; a more exact analysis would give \\"Enjoy a lot, picture here, speaker.\\" But other translations would be possible to indicate whether the opinion is personal or admitted more generally, by adding modifiers (considered adjectives in Kalaba-X) to the subject part (considered a noun) to condition the sentence, or to the object part (also considered a noun) to extend the scope of the predicate. Adding more modifiers in Kalaba-X to the initial verb part of such sentence can make the semantic more precise by including various modes (including tense, variability, recurrence, progress, negation...) but also logical composition relations like unions, intersections and exclusions).

Job's is also very rare at about 300 cases currently in the literature. Presentation It is characterized by recurrent \\"cold\\" staphylococcal infections (due to impaired recruitment of neutrophils), unusual eczema-like skin rashes, severe lung infections that result in pneumatoceles (balloon-like lesions that may be filled with air or pus or scar tissue) and very high concentrations of the serum antibody IgE. Inheritance can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Many patients with autosomal dominant STAT3 hyper-IgE syndrome have characteristic facial and dental abnormalities, fail to lose their primary teeth, and have two sets of teeth simultaneously. Pathophysiology Abnormal neutrophil chemotaxis due to decreased production of interferon gamma by T lymphocytes is thought to cause the disease. Both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance have been described: Autosomal dominant: * STAT3 may present as HIES with characteristic facial, dental, and skeletal abnormalities that has been called Job's Syndrome. A common mnemonic used to remember the symptoms is FATED: coarse or leonine facies, cold staph abscesses, retained primary teeth, increased IgE, and dermatologic problems [eczema]. The disease was linked to mutations in the STAT3 gene after cytokine profiles indicated alterations in the STAT3 pathway. Autosomal recessive: * DOCK8 - DOCK8 Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DIDS) presents primarily with immune effects including HEIS. Eczema is prominent, food and environmental allergies are common, and asthma and anaphylaxis has been variably reported. * PGM3, a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, may present as HIES with neurocognitive impairment and hypomyelination. See PGM3 deficiency. * SPINK5 may present as HIES with skin and hair effects such as trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair). See Netherton Syndrome (NTS). * TYK2 may present as HIES, although more often only with immunodeficiency. Diagnosis Elevated IgE is the hallmark of HIES. An IgE level greater than 2,000 IU/mL is often considered diagnostic. However, patients younger than 6 months of age may have very low to non-detectable IgE levels. Eosinophilia is also a common finding with greater than 90% of patients having eosinophil elevations greater than two standard deviations above the normal mean. Genetic testing is available for STAT3 (Job's Syndrome), DOCK8 (DOCK8 Immunodeficiency or DIDS), PGM3 (PGM3 deficiency), SPINK5 (Netherton Syndrome - NTS), and TYK2 genetic defects. Types HIES often appears early in life with recurrent staphylococcal and candidal infections, pneumonias, and eczematoid skin. *Autosomal dominant Hyper-IgE Syndrome caused by STAT3 defects, called Job Syndrome, have characteristic facial, dental, and skeletal abnormalities. Patients with STAT3 HIES may have either delay of or failure in shedding of primary teeth. The characteristic facial features are usually set by age 16. These include facial asymmetry, a prominent forehead, deep-set eyes, a broad nasal bridge, a wide, fleshy nasal tip, and mild prognathism. Additionally, facial skin is rough with prominent pores. Finally, some patients with STAT3 HIES have scoliosis, as well as bones that fracture easily. *Autosomal recessive Treatment Most patients with hyper IgE syndrome are treated with long-term antibiotic therapy to prevent staphylococcal infections. Good skin care is also important in patients with hyper IgE syndrome. High-dose intravenous gamma-globulin has also been suggested for the treatment of severe eczema in patients with HIES and atopic dermatitis. History HIES was first described by Davis et al. in 1966 in two girls with red hair, chronic dermatitis, and recurrent staphylococcal abscesses and pneumonias. They named the disease after the biblical figure Job, whose body was covered with boils by Satan. In 1972, Buckley et al. described two boys with similar symptoms as well as coarse facies, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels. These two syndromes are thought to be the same and are under the broad category of HIES.

Construction projects falling into this category are sometimes referred to as \\"notifiable\\", however this is different from the \\"notification\\" (which may also be required under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, which seeks to monitor health and safety in construction projects. The rules vary for Scotland and Northern Ireland, but elsewhere Building Regulations approval can usually be obtained by application to a building control body (BCB), of which there are two types: local Authority BCBs (usually a council's building control department) and private BCBs (known as Approved Inspectors). If an Approved Inspector is used, before any controlled building work can start on site they must inform the local authority about the work. This is called giving an 'initial notice'. This notice states that a particular Approved Inspector is the BCB for the specified works, at the specified location. If using a local authority, approval can be obtained in 1 of 3 ways:- 1. Full Plans By the \\"full plans\\" method where drawings are deposited with the Local Authority and are subsequently checked for compliance with the Building Regulations. The various stages of the work are also inspected and checked for compliance with the relevant technical requirements of the Building Regulations; by a Building Control Surveyor employed by the Local Authority. This is the most thorough option. And a response from the Local Authority will typically take 4–8 weeks. However, unlike planning permission, work may start before approval has been granted. It is also quite usual for the final building to differ in some respects to that which received full plans approval, in which case amended \\"as built\\" plans are often required to be submitted to the Local Authority. A \\"completion certificate\\" is issued upon completion, as long as the completed work complies with the Building Regulations. 2. Building Notice By the \\"building notice\\" method where notice of commencement of (minor) building work is given to the Local Authority at least two days prior to commencement of work. The various stages of the work are then inspected and approved by the Local Authority but no plans are checked. This method may not be used if the premises contain a workplace, or creates new flats. 3. Regularisation This is the retrospective approval for work already carried out without consent - and can only be administered by a Local Authority. Most commonly, it is used by the owner of a building to apply for retrospective approval for illegal building work. The Local Authority will assess, and verify by means of site visits, plans and information submitted, identify non-compliant items, open up and inspect works, monitor the making good of defective work and, if satisfied, issue a Certificate. An application for a Regularisation Certificate does not prevent the Authority taking legal action for failure to comply with the Building Regulations when the work was first carried out. Generally Fees are paid to the Building Control Body, with each application. These will vary depending on the size and value of the project, and between different Local authorities across the country, and each Approved Inspector is free to set their own levels of charges. Some types of work may be exempt fees, e.g. adaptations or alterations for Disabled Persons. Some work such as Electrical and Heating installations can be carried out by persons who can certify work as being Building Regulation compliant, without further inspection by either the Local Authority or an Approved Inspector. Any work certified in this way must however be registered with the Local Authority in the geographical area in which the work has been carried out. A Building Control Body should issue a \\"Completion Certificate\\" or \\"Final Certificate\\" upon the practical completion of each building project, to state that the work meets the technical requirements of the Building Regulations. If an Approved Inspector cannot do this due to omissions and/or known failures of the building work to show compliance with the relevant technical requirements of the Building Regulations, then the relevant local authority should investigate and consider the need to take appropriate enforcement action. Building Regulation 'Enforcement Action' and/or 'incomplete work status' is normally recorded in the Local Lands Charges Register, held as a 'public record' by the relevant local authority. Solicitors must search these records prior to any purchase of any building.

It was made available by O'Neil to JewishGen for the purpose of fulfilling their mission of disseminating knowledge about the Holocaust. The monograph is devoted to the history of the German SS training facility at Rabka in occupied Poland where, \\"under the cloak of war – personal vendetta, corruption, robbery and murder [became] endemic among the SS\\" functionaries. O'Neil reveals how the euphemistic language spoken within the Nazi State allowed for the sanitization of genocide and the creation of the complete illusion of 'plain speak' in phrases such as 'treatment', 'processing', and 'resettlement' which enabled the SS to turn mass murder into a \\"bureaucratic paper chase\\".

His name is lent to the eponymous Korsakoff's syndrome and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Early life and education Sergei Korsakoff was the first great Russian neuropsychiatrist. He studied medicine at the Moscow State University, graduated in 1875 and subsequently became a physician at the \\"Preobrazhenski\\" () mental hospital. From 1876 to 1879, he gained postgraduate experience in the clinic for nervous diseases under Aleksei Kozhevnikov. His thesis Alcoholic Paralysis gained him a medical doctorate in 1887.

During this time, he visited Vienna, where he was a pupil of Theodor Meynert. He was ordinarius of neurology and psychiatry from 1899 until his death the next year. He died from heart failure at the age of 46. Legacy Korsakoff was one of the greatest neuropsychiatrists of the 19th century and published numerous works in neuropathology, psychiatry, and forensic medicine. Apart from his studies on alcoholic psychosis, he introduced the concept of paranoia and wrote an excellent textbook on psychiatry. Korsakoff studied the effects of alcoholism on the nervous system and drew attention to several cases of alcoholic polyneuropathy with distinctive mental symptoms (Korsakoff's syndrome). An able organiser, Korsakoff was instrumental in founding the Moscow Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists. The Zhurnal nevropatologii i psikhiatrii imeni Korsakova (, Korsakoff's Journal of Neuropathology and Psychiatry) was named after him. Associated eponyms * Korsakoff's psychosis and syndrome: Amnestic-confabulatory syndrome with three salient features (1) severe memory defect, especially for recent events; (2) confabulation (i.e., falsification of memory in an alert, responsive individual); and (3) polyneuropathy (psychosis polyneuritica), usually associated with alcoholism and malnutrition. * Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome or Polioencephalitis haemorrhagica superior associated with Korsakov's psychosis: A condition characterized by nystagmus, ocular and conjugate gaze palsies, ataxia and psychosis due to nutritional deficiency, more specifically of thiamine and observed mainly, though not exclusively, in alcoholics.

The business plan was to secure and publish third-party developer software, thus avoiding the high risk and cost of in-house development, and therefore passing on higher royalties to the licensed developers. The corporation secured several retail titles in both educational and entertainment genres in the first few years of operation. Early successes led to a successful multimillion-dollar initial public offering (IPO) on NASDAQ in late 1997. Closing  The company continued operations until cash-flow problems forced it out of business in July 1999. Piranha Interactive Publishing did not file for Bankruptcy; rather, they closed their doors and liquidated their assets. The following press release was sent out and posted on the company's web site: Piranha Interactive Publishing, Inc. Terminates Operations' For Immediate Release (July 9, 1999) Tempe, Arizona - Piranha Interactive Publishing, Inc. Piranha Interactive Publishing, Inc. announced today that it has ceased operations effective as of the close of business on Friday, July 2, 1999. The Company has been unable to generate sufficient cashflow from its operations to meet its expenses and has been unable to secure additional working capital. The Company's securities were delisted from the Nasdaq SmallCap market as of the close of business on June 23. The lack of an active market for Company's securities drastically limited the Company's ability to secure additional capital. The Company is in the process of liquidating all remaining assets and the proceeds will be distributed to creditors. The Company's liabilities are far in excess of its assets. The final distribution to creditors is expected to be de minimis.  Software  Piranha Interactive's most successful published software title was RedShift 3, an interactive astronomy program that was the winner of the 1999 Codie \\"Excellence In Software\\" Award for \\"Best New Home Education For Teenagers and Adults.\\" Some other Piranha titles included: * Air Blocks (IBM PC) * Ancient Origins (IBM PC) (Macintosh) * Dead Reckoning (IBM PC) * Extreme Tactics (IBM PC) * Majestic (Hybrid Windows/Macintosh) * Morpheus (Hybrid Windows/Macintosh) * Planetary Missions (IBM PC) (Macintosh) * Preschool Mother Goose (Hybrid Windows/Macintosh) * Revenge of the Toys (IBM PC) * Skybase (IBM PC) (Macintosh) * Syn-Factor (Hybrid Windows/Macintosh) The company also published a number of compilations (or \\"Piranha Packs\\") of educational, productivity and entertainment titles.  Affiliations  There is some confusion on the Internet as to which companies were affiliated with Piranha Interactive. For example, one site erroneously indicates that Piranha Interactive was an American label of MacMillan Software, Ltd., a British firm.Adventureland (http://www.if- legends.org/~adventure/Piranha_Interactive_Publishing.html) While Piranha Interactive licensed several of its titles to foreign publishers for distribution in other countries, the two companies were distinct and never collaborated on software publishing efforts. However, MacMillan Software did have an in-house Piranha label for some of their titles, giving rise to the confusion. At least two firms appear to have been using some variation of the Piranha name and/or a variation of the logo: Piranha Bytes Software GmbH (founded in 1997) and Piranha Games.Piranha Games (http://www.piranha- games.com) Another source of confusion is the suggestion that the company was reconstituted in 2000 as Tiburon Interactive Publishing, Inc. However, Piranha completely closed operations in 1999 and is no longer extant. Shortly thereafter, two of the former Piranha employees bought the licenses to some of the software titles and continue to publish them under a different company, Tiburon Interactive.Tiburon Interactive Publishing (http://www.sharkbyte.org)  References  :: Piranha Interactive Publishing Official Site (archived) at Internet Archive Category:Publishing companies established in 1995 Category:Video game companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Tempe, Arizona ","title":"Piranha Interactive Publishing"},{"id":"4467335","text":"Morpheus is an American computer game released in 1998.

The story is that they originated in Haiti, under the harsh conditions of slavery. The term petro can also refer to a drum used in the music of Haiti. \\"Petro\\" loas are often considered to be \\"angry\\" or demon loa, used in \\"black magic\\". They are the \\"newer\\" loa that can relate to the harsh, traumatic conditions that slaves had to endure. Story Their rites feature whip cracking, whistles and ignited gunpowder. In addition, Petro drumbeats are swifter and more syncopated than the Rada rhythms. Danto is considered the \\"mother\\" of the Petro nation and is one of the most important Petro loa. Where Her sister Freda (a Rada loa) is known for Her softness and gentleness, Danto is known for Her strength. When faced with harsh reality Freda breaks down in tears; Danto's response is an inarticulate shuddering tantrum. Hierarchy Haitian spirits, or loa, are divided into several \\"nations.\\" Two of the major nations are the Rada and Petro. The Rada loa spirits like Damballa, Erzulie Freda and Papa Legba -- are said to come from Africa, from the former Dahomean empire. Many scholars believe that the name \\"Rada\\" is a corruption of \\"Arara,\\" an African port from whence many slave ships were launched. Rada spirits are typically thought to be peaceful or benign. Some mistakenly refer to the Rada loa as \\"good\\" and the Petro as \\"evil.\\" This is misleading; the Rada loa can be used to make malevolent magic, while the Petro can heal and do beneficial workings. They are more accurately referred to as \\"cool\\" and \\"hot,\\" respectively. Rites The Petro rites are an integral part of the initiation ceremony (Kanzo), the rite by which serviteurs are initiated as priests and priestesses (houngans and mambos) of Haitian Vodou. The Bat Ge, the ceremony that precedes the Kanzo, is dedicated to the Petwo loa, and the paquet congo created by and for new initiates are made under the watch of the Petwo spirits.

Yadgar Muhammad Mirza was born to Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonqor, who was a grandson of Shah Rukh. It was his family ties that caused Uzun Hasan, Sultan of the Ak Koyunlu confederation, to hand over to him Abu Sa'id Mirza, whom he had defeated and captured at the Battle of Qarabagh in 1469. Abu Sa'id, who had previously ordered the execution of Gawhar Shad, Yadigar Muhammad Mirza's great-grandmother, was subsequently killed. Later in 1469, Uzun Hasan had Yadgar Muhammad Mirza proclaimed as Abu Sa'id's successor and provided him with Timurid forces so that he could take over Khurasan, which was then controlled by Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah. Although Yadgar Muhammad Mirza was defeated by Husayn in battle in September, fresh reinforcements were sent by the Ak Koyunlu leader. Furthermore, two of Uzun Hasan's sons arrived to assist him. Eventually Husayn was compelled to evacuate Herat, which Yadgar Muhammad Mirza occupied in July 1470. Despite this, his troops were unreliable and Husayn re-entered Herat six weeks later. Yadgar Muhammad Mirza, who was captured, was promptly executed. He was the last descendant of Shah Rukh to play a dominant role in the politics of the Timurid principalities.

Before Mute Records was sold to the EMI group, Blast First fit into the company's profile, which included labels such as the Fine Line and the Grey Area. The labels employees included the sisters Pat and Liz Naylor, and the novelist Alistair Fruish. The label released a range of alternative music from Butthole Surfers and Labradford through Suicide and Sonic Youth to the William Fairey Band's Acid Brass collection. The latter, a departure for a label noted for its guitar based rock bands, was a covers album of tunes such as A Guy Called Gerald's \\"Voodoo Ray\\" and 808 State's \\"Pacific,\\" all replayed by a brass band.

Goals in constraint logic programming are evaluated concurrently; a concurrent process is therefore programmed as the evaluation of a goal by the interpreter. Syntactically, concurrent constraints logic programs are similar to non- concurrent programs, the only exception being that clauses include guards, which are constraints that may block the applicability of the clause under some conditions. Semantically, concurrent constraint logic programming differs from its non-concurrent versions because a goal evaluation is intended to realize a concurrent process rather than finding a solution to a problem. Most notably, this difference affects how the interpreter behaves when more than one clause is applicable: non-concurrent constraint logic programming recursively tries all clauses; concurrent constraint logic programming chooses only one. This is the most evident effect of an intended directionality of the interpreter, which never revise a choice it has previously taken. Other effects of this are the semantical possibility of having a goal that cannot be proved while the whole evaluation does not fail, and a particular way for equating a goal and a clause head. Constraint handling rules can be seen as a form of concurrent constraint logic programming,Frühwirth, Thom. \\"Theory and practice of constraint handling rules.\\" The Journal of Logic Programming 37.1-3 (1998): 95-138. but are used for programming a constraint simplifier or solver rather than concurrent processes. Description In constraint logic programming, the goals in the current goal are evaluated sequentially, usually proceeding in a LIFO order in which newer goals are evaluated first. The concurrent version of logic programming allows for evaluating goals in parallel: every goal is evaluated by a process, and processes run concurrently. These processes interact via the constraint store: a process can add a constraint to the constraint store while another one checks whether a constraint is entailed by the store. Adding a constraint to the store is done like in regular constraint logic programming. Checking entailment of a constraint is done via guards to clauses. Guards require a syntactic extension: a clause of concurrent constraint logic programming is written as \`H :- G  B\` where \`G\` is a constraint called the guard of the clause. Roughly speaking, a fresh variant of this clause can be used to replace a literal in the goal only if the guard is entailed by the constraint store after the equation of the literal and the clause head is added to it. The precise definition of this rule is more complicated, and is given below. The main difference between non-concurrent and concurrent constraint logic programming is that the first is aimed at search, while the second is aimed at implementing concurrent processes. This difference affects whether choices can be undone, whether processes are allowed not to terminate, and how goals and clause heads are equated. The first semantical difference between regular and concurrent constraint logic programming is about the condition when more than one clause can be used for proving a goal. Non-concurrent logic programming tries all possible clauses when rewriting a goal: if the goal cannot be proved while replacing it with the body of a fresh variant of a clause, another clause is proved, if any. This is because the aim is to prove the goal: all possible ways to prove the goal are tried. On the other hand, concurrent constraint logic programming aims at programming parallel processes. In general concurrent programming, if a process makes a choice, this choice cannot be undone. The concurrent version of constraint logic programming implements processes by allowing them to take choices, but committing to them once they have been taken. Technically, if more than one clause can be used to rewrite a literal in the goal, the non-concurrent version tries in turn all clauses, while the concurrent version chooses a single arbitrary clause: contrary to the non-concurrent version, the other clauses will never be tried. These two different ways for handling multiple choices are often called \\"don't know nondeterminism\\" and \\"don't care nondeterminism\\". When rewriting a literal in the goal, the only considered clauses are those whose guard is entailed by the union of the constraint store and the equation of the literal with the clause head. The guards provide a way for telling which clauses are not to be considered at all. This is particularly important given the commitment to a single clause of concurrent constraint logic programming: once a clause has been chosen, this choice will be never reconsidered. Without guards, the interpreter could choose a \\"wrong\\" clause to rewrite a literal, while other \\"good\\" clauses exist. In non-concurrent programming, this is less important, as the interpreter always tries all possibilities. In concurrent programming, the interpreter commits to a single possibility without trying the other ones. A second effect of the difference between the non-concurrent and the concurrent version is that concurrent constraint logic programming is specifically designed to allow processes to run without terminating. Non- terminating processes are common in general in concurrent processing; the concurrent version of constraint logic programming implements them by not using the condition of failure: if no clause is applicable for rewriting a goal, the process evaluating this goal stops instead of making the whole evaluation fail like in non-concurrent constraint logic programming. As a result, the process evaluating a goal may be stopped because no clause is available to proceed, but at the same time the other processes keep running. Synchronization among processes that are solving different goals is achieved via the use of guards. If a goal cannot be rewritten because all clauses that could be used have a guard that is not entailed by the constraint store, the process solving this goal is blocked until the other processes add the constraints that are necessary to entail the guard of at least one of the applicable clauses. This synchronization is subject to deadlocks: if all goals are blocked, no new constraints will be added and therefore no goal will ever be unblocked. A third effect of the difference between concurrent and non- concurrent logic programming is in the way a goal is equated to the head of a fresh variant of a clause. Operationally, this is done by checking whether the variables in the head can be equated to terms in such a way the head is equal to the goal. This rule differs from the corresponding rule for constraint logic programming in that it only allows adding constraints in the form variable=term, where the variable is one of the head. This limitation can be seen as a form of directionality, in that the goal and the clause head are treated differently. Precisely, the rule telling whether a fresh variant \`H:-GB\` of a clause can be used to rewrite a goal \`A\` is as follows. First, it is checked whether \`A\` and \`H\` have the same predicate. Second, it is checked whether there exists a way for equating A with H given the current constraint store; contrary to regular logic programming, this is done under one-sided unification, which only allows a variable of the head to be equal to a term. Third, the guard is checked for entailment from the constraint store and the equations generated in the second step; the guard may contain variables that are not mentioned in the clause head: these variables are interpreted existentially. This method for deciding the applicability of a fresh variant of a clause for replacing a goal can be compactly expressed as follows: the current constraint store entails that there exists an evaluation of the variables of the head and the guard such that the head is equal to the goal and the guard is entailed. In practice, entailment may be checked with an incomplete method. An extension to the syntax and semantics of concurrent logic programming is the atomic tell. When the interpreter uses a clause, its guard is added to the constraint store. However, also added are the constraints of the body. Due to commitment to this clause, the interpreter does not backtrack if the constraints of the body are inconsistent with the store. This condition can be avoided by the use of atomic tell, which is a variant in which the clause contain a sort of \\"second guard\\" that is only checked for consistency. Such a clause is written \`H :- G:DB\`. This clause is used to rewrite a literal only if \`G\` is entailed by the constraint store and \`D\` is consistent with it. In this case, both \`G\` and \`D\` are added to the constraint store. History The study of concurrent constraint logic programming started at the end of the 1980s, when some of the principles of concurrent logic programming were integrated into constraint logic programming by Michael J. Maher. The theoretical properties of concurrent constraint logic programming were later studied by various authors.

Life Mills' ancestors had emigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 1600s. Ossian Everett Mills was born to Andrew and Maria Wheaton Perry Mills in Thompson, Connecticut on February 16, 1856. Andrew Mills was himself a music teacher. The name Ossian is an anglicized version of Oisin, who in Irish mythology, was regarded as the greatest poet of Ireland and was a fianna warrior. This legendary figure played prominently in the work Fingal, an Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books, together with Several Other Poems composed by Ossian, the Son of Fingal, translated from the Gaelic Language, written in musical measured prose, published by Scottish poet James MacPherson in 1761. The source of Mills' given name is ironic given the later traditions associated with the fraternity that he would establish. Mills married Clara Cleveland Carper, the daughter of Homer Carper and Catherine Welch, on August 28, 1883 in Delaware, Ohio. Clara was born on December 28, 1863 in Ohio, and died twenty-six years after her husband on January 14, 1952 in Newton, Massachusetts. The Mills had one son, Homer Ossian Mills, Sr., who was born on March 5, 1888 in Boston, attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst and died in Putnam, Connecticut, on June 5, 1973. As early as 1879, Ossian Mills went to Boston and was eventually employed in the business office of the New England Conservatory by Dr. Eben Tourjee, founder of the institution. Mills rose eventually to be bursar, the position he held at the time of his death, and the one through which he had been known to thousands of conservatory teachers and students. While his father was a music instructor, and while it has been reported that his wife was a vocalist, Ossian Mills' specific musical background and/or training remains unclear. In 1898, Mills founded the Sinfonia Club at the Conservatory, which would soon become the Alpha chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity of America. He was made an honorary member of the club at its first meeting on October 6, 1898. On November 14, 1898, the chapter elected him treasurer, an office which he held for many years afterward. Although the first initiation of new members took place on November 28, 1898, Mills was not initiated until the following meeting on December 13. Often referred to as the \\"Father of Sinfonia\\", Mills was a familiar figure at annual conventions until his last years when his work would not permit his leaving Boston. He served the fraternity as its first and fourth supreme president (1901-1902 and 1904–1905) and was elected \\"Honorary Grand Supreme President for Life\\" in 1904. Along with the fraternity's sixth supreme president, Percy Jewett Burrell, he has been credited by Fraternity historians with formulating the basic philosophies and spiritual values espoused by the fraternity. Much of this fundamental philosophy is encapsulated in his presidential messages and other writings that appeared in Fraternity publications between 1902 and 1915. Today, these writings are regularly used to instruct the fraternity's probationary members about the obligations and expectations of fraternity membership. As late as 1917, Mills continued to sign membership certificates, but other specific involvement during that time is unclear. During the period from approximately 1917 to 1920 or 1922, the Fraternity went through a transition period marked by organizational difficulty on the national level (resulting in the cancellation of the national convention two years in a row), complicated by the United States' involvement in World War I. Ossian Everett Mills died from a short bout with pneumonia at his home in Wellesley, Massachusetts on December 26, 1920 (several days after the Fraternity's national convention, though it is unclear as to whether or not Mills had been in attendance). His funeral was held on December 28 at Wellesley (Boston Globe, December 28, 1920) and was buried in the family plot of West Thompson Cemetery in Thompson, Connecticut. In December 1928, the Fraternity under the leadership of Peter Dykema dedicated a memorial marker at Mills' gravesite (Boston Globe, December 22, 1928). After the ceremony was adapted for a special centennial memorial service at the site in 1998, it was adapted for use as the Fraternity's Founders Day Ceremony. In preparation for the 1998 centennial celebration of the fraternity, John Mongiovi, then serving as Chair of the Fraternity's CPR Council, located Arthur Mills and invited him and his wife to participate in the commemorative events in Boston, as well as the Mills memorial service conducted in Putnam. Six years later, in recognition of his support of Fraternity leaders in their historical research efforts, Arthur Warren Mills was initiated into the fraternity's national honorary Alpha Alpha Chapter in October 2004 during a weekend of Founders Day events in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The ceremony itself was conducted at the Boston Conservatory. In addition, a great-great- grandson, Eric Mills, was initiated as a collegiate member by the Gamma Theta Chapter at the University of North Texas in 2008. During his time as an active member there, he served as Fraternal Education Officer and Music Director for the chapter. Eric's father (Ossian's great-grandson), Arthur Warren Mills III, was initiated in September 2012, as an honorary member of the Gamma Theta Chapter. Thus, the Fraternity spans five generations in the Mills family. Legacy The National Philanthropy of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia continues to be known as the Mills Music Mission, named for Ossian Everett Mills. Around 1886, Mills originated the practice of taking a group of New England Conservatory students to perform for patients in Boston hospitals on Christmas and Easter. The students would sing, play music and give recitations. The students would also bring flowers to distribute to the patients. Mills' \\"flower missions,\\" as they came to be known, brought joy to the lonely and hope to the destitute. The Mills Music Mission was accepted as Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia's National Philanthropy in 2003. It is unique among fraternity philanthropies in that Sinfonians make a personal sacrifice to help individuals and lift spirits through music. During the week of February 11–18, 2006, almost 200 chapters and alumni associations participated in Mills Music Missions in observance of Ossian Everett Mills' 150th birthday. The Fraternity presents the Ossian E. Mills Award to a Sinfonian who, through his leadership and dedication, has immeasurably furthered the cause of Phi Mu Alpha on a national scale and who embodies the ideals of the Fraternity. The first recipient was former national executive director Edward A. Klint, who received the award at the 1988 national convention. Subsequent recipients have included James H. Patrenos, Henry Charles, T. Jervis Underwood, Richard A. Crosby, and John Mongiovi. Mills' memory and contributions are commemorated annually by the members of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia on October 6, which is designated as the Fraternity's Founder's Day. During the Fraternity's Centennial celebration in October 1998, a memorial service was held at Mills' grave site, utilizing a format based on a ceremony used to dedicate Mills' monument which was placed in 1928. The Fraternity's Founder's Day Ceremony is based on this ceremony. Mills' writings are often used during the probationary membership process to provide instruction and insight into the philosophies and values that guided Mills and other members in the establishment of the Fraternity and to provide a framework for fulfilling the obligations of membership.

The castle of Amberd and some sections of walls were constructed in the 7th century as a possession of the noble House of Kamsarakan. Four centuries later the fortress and surrounding lands were purchased by the House of Pahlavuni and rebuilt by Prince Vahram Pahlavouni, as is recorded in the manuscripts of Grigor Magistros Pahlavuni. Vahram built the Church of Surb Astvatsatsin in 1026, fortified the complex with thicker stone walls, and added three bastions along the ridge of the Arkhashen canyon. Despite being unusual for a military installation, a bath house was built in the same period and has remained moderately intact along with the water supply system. Amberd was invaded in the 1070s by the Seljuq Turks who turned it into a military base. In 1197, a joint-army of Armenians and Georgians led by General Zakare Zakarian liberated the fortress. Under Zakarian control during the 12th and 13th centuries, the walls were structurally reinforced and the castle and outer buildings were renovated. The noble Vacheh Vachutian purchased Amberd in 1215, making it a key defensive site in the region. Within a short period of time, the Mongols captured and destroyed the fortress in the year 1236. The site remained abandoned and untouched until the 20th century, when reconstruction and archaeological excavations began.  Architecture = Fortress  The castle ruins of Amberd comprised an area of . Its walls are constructed of roughly hewn basalt blocks set in place with mortar. Tower walls are inclined to have made it easier to fire on invaders below. The interior of the castle had three-stories, each floor separated from one another by wood planks clinched on logs. There were five rooms in the first and second floor, each arranged in a row where one would enter each room through the previous room. An irregularly shaped hallway was separate from the three internal rooms by an internal wall. On the third floor were the reception areas and private rooms for its royal inhabitants. The structural configuration is thought to have not changed since it was first built in the 10th century. Excavations have shown that the interior of the castle and rooms were quite lavish with elegantly carved decorations in the rooms, oil lamps, incense holders, and walls decorated with silks and brocades, and with bronze, gold and silver ornamentation.  Water supply  At Amberd, a constant water supply was crucial for its inhabitants. The fortress' primary viaduct was a terra cotta pipeline that had been laid from the fortress to dammed reservoirs which collected sources of spring water from higher elevations and melting snow. In the event that the fortress was under attack, it was likely that the pipeline would be destroyed. Therefore, another more secret water supply would need to ensure a constant flow of water to its inhabitants to keep them from dying from thirst. A covered passageway that led from the fortifications along a steep pathway descending down a cleft in the rocks to the Arkashen River performed such a task.  Bath house  The bath house south of the fortress was built between the 10th and 11th centuries. Its twin bathing rooms each with a single dome are still moderately intact. At one time it had used hypocaust heating as had originated in Roman times, to heat the floors. Pipes that ran through the floors and walls of the structure were heated by a fire built under the floor, which then forced the heat throughout the bathing rooms. Metal pipes supplied hot water to the baths.  Brief Chronological History  900-920 AD - The Arabs, during one of their periodic invasions, conquer and lay waste the town of Byurakan, 6 or 7 km from Amberd, but historian Hovhannes Draskhanakerttsi in his account of the event says nothing of Amberd. No other Armenian historian mention it until at least the year 1000. 900-1000 - Ashot II Yerkat (of iron) Bagratuni begins liberating the country from Arabs, and conquers back old fortresses, restoring them and building additional new ones to complete country's defense system. An ever increasing scarcity of soldiers and organized armies, makes a series of fortified strongholds indispensable. 900-1100 - In the wake of these new constructions, terminated by Bagratuni dynasty, originators of the defense system to the East, popular tradition attributes the construction of Amberd to the king, Ashot II Yerkat: a national hero. During the long period from 900-1100, works are carried out to restore Amberd's eastern entrance and fortify all of it, as previously it was only an unfortified summer residence. 1020 - Gagik I Bagratuni dies and divides his kingdom among his three sons: Hovhannes-Smbat, Abas and Ashot. The first-born Hovhannes-Smbat receives the crown of Ani, the possession of the Ararat Plain, all the region of Shirak, and Amberd. 1026 - The Pahlavuni dynasty the most important noble family in the court of Bagratuni kings is given Amberd. It is their duty to make the necessary military commitments for the country's defense. Vahram Pahlavouni inaugurates the castle church in this years, as the inscription on its facade testifies. From this date onward Amberd becomes the most important center in the defensive system of the Shirak region, and the kingdom of Ani. 1040 - At approximately this time, Vahram Pahlavouni rebuilds walls of the fortress which remains in his hands until his death. 1040-1050 - Before the death of Vahram Pahlavouni, Sargis Vardapet visits Grigor Magistros Pahlanuni who is at Amberd on an assignment for the king, Gagik II. 1045 - An event with important consequences of Armenia takes place in Constantinople. The Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos calls the king Gagik II and forces him to hand over the city of Ani. 1045 - Vahram Pahlavouni and his son Grigor fall in battle at the foot of Dvin. 1050 - Katakalon Kekaumenos and General Konstantin take possession of fortresses belonging to Gagik II, which had been captured by the Emir Shaddadiyan, in one of the many Turkish raids. The fortresses are: Sourb- Mari (Sourmair or Sourmalou), Ampier (Amberd), Sourb Grigor (perhaps near Parpi) and Khelidonion (Tsitsernakaberd). 1050 - The Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos names Katakalon Kekaumenos governor of Ani and promotes the eunuch Konstantin to general of Byzantine armies in the Orient. 1064 - The fortress of Amberd is partially destroyed and reconquered together with provinces of Ayrarat, Lori and Syunik by the Seljuk king Alp Arslan, during the fourth invasion of Armenia. 1196 - The brothers Ivane and Zakare liberate Amberd and the cities of Ani, Bjni, Marand and Tabriz from Seljuk domination: an inscription in the monastery of Haghartsin commemorates the event. After such incidents, the archbishop's see of the region is moved from Byurakan to Amberd which offers better defense system. 1100-1200 during the entire century, the Zakarian family, the liberators of the region, restore and complete the fortress. 1200 - The heroic liberation of Amberd by Zakare Sipahsalar general of Georgian and Armenian armies is commemorated by a khachkar in the Norashen church at Iraklou. 1215 - One of the most important feudatories, Vache, and father of Prince Kurd Vachutian, buys the fortress of Amberd from Ivane Zakarian. The event is commemorated by an inscription in the Saghmosavank monastery. Later Prince Vache, the son of Vache Vachutian is nominated the governor of the Aragatsotn Province and Amberd by Zakare Sipahsalar. 1236 - The fortress is conquered by the Mongols and nearly demolished. 1250-1300 - The sons of Prince Kurd, Davit, Vache, Tayir, and Hasan govern the region which during this period. Vachutians rebuilt the fortress and made it the residence of the Vachutian family, whereas the religious authorities are housed in Hovhannavank monastery. 1254 - The Vachutian princes, well protected by their own defense system, not only succeed in remaining independent during the Mongolian occupation, but carry out an autonomous policy of friendship and allegiances as well. In 1254 the king of Armenian Cilicia, Hethum, stops at Amberd as guest of Kurd II Vachutian on his way to the court of the Mongolian Khan to sign a pact of alliance with him. 1335 - A manuscript describes the heroic enterprise of Prince Kurd, son of Tayir and grandson of Kurd, who acts as a bulwark against the enemy invasions and succeeds in making the region prosper in peace. 1338 - In an inscription in both church of Karbi and the Hovhannavank monastery Theodoros Chrkin, son of Prince Kurd, is commemorated. 1300-1350 - Neither codices nor inscriptions speak of the Vachutian family, who seem to have disappeared from the pagers of history. The fortress is abandoned, and falls into progressive ruin although in case of danger it is still a periodic refuge for the inhabitants of the plain. 1600-1700 - The territory has long since passed from the Ottomans to Persians. A quotation from that period however, mentions that Davit Kanakertsi is named governor of provinces of Kote and Amberd by the Persian governor of Yerevan, Amirkiune. Chronology of the Amberd Excavations 1936 - Excavations are begun with the participation of experts from the Hermitage Museum and the Academy of Sciences of Soviet Armenia, whose director is Joseph Orbeli. During the excavations around the castle, the baths, the secret passage and the chapel, discovery is made of the rooms connected to the baths, the main entrance with a staircase leading to the castle, a water cistern located between the walls, as well as the outer walls of the citadel. 1963 - This second survey is sponsored by the Archaeological and Ethnographic Institute of Soviet Armenia under the direction of N.M. Tokarski. The upper part of the fortress, and the foundations of homes, workshops and service rooms are found. Furthermore, sections of the wall dating back to the Bagratuni and to the successive period of Zakarian are uncovered along the outside of the fortified wall. Tokarski suggested that some parts of the fortress and its walls were built by the Kamsarakan family in the 7th century. 1964 - The excavations Archaeological and Ethnographic Institute of Soviet Armenia continue under S.V. Harutiunian on the south side where it is hoped to find walls from the Urartian period. 1965 - The excavations start again and last until 1968. The northern part of the church, the foundation of buildings from the Bagratuni period, and a plastered building located 100 meters to the north of the church, are brought to light. 1966 - The cleaning of the grounds around the church is completed. 1968 - The oldest entrance to the fortress is discovered north of the church. South of it are found sections of the fortress wall with its connected buildings. Numerous archaeological relics are unearthed.

The De Candolle system is a subsequent taxonomic system. * It was originally published by de Candolle in the Théorie élémentaire de la botanique, ou exposition des principes de la classification naturelle et de l’art de décrire et d’etudier les végétaux (1813). * It was further developed and published in editions of the very extensive but unfinished Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis (Prodromus) (1824–1873), dealing only with dicotyledons. The abbreviation Syst. in de Candolle's work and subsequent literature refers to his Regni vegetabilis systema naturale. Systems The De Candolle system recognises the following groups of vascular plants (references to Prodromus). Within the Prodromus he cross references his earlier Regni vegetabilis systema naturale.

History  On February 9, 2012, The Connaught Group, parent company to Carlisle Collection, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and made plans to sell the company at auction. On April 5, 2012, women’s wear direct-seller The Connaught Group was sold for $22 million to a joint venture between Tennessee-based and Hong Kong’s Royal Spirit Group, following an April 5 bankruptcy auction in New York. The new parent company \\"Carlisle Etcetera LLC\\" assumed control of the Carlisle Collection and the related direct sales fashion line Etcetera. The purchase price consisted of $20 million in cash and the assumption of the lease for Connaught’s midtown Manhattan office spaces. Royal Spirit Group, a clothing manufacturer that was Connaught’s largest creditor, also waived its $5.4 million general unsecured claim. As of April 2013, it was reported by Carlisle Etcetera LLC - CEO that the new company has turned a profit in their first calendar year since assuming control. In 2015, Hong Kong’s Royal Spirit Group acquired CARLISLE from founding parent company, The Connaught Group. CARLISLE made its runway debut at NYFW in February 2018 featuring its Fall 2018 collection designed by Fred Tutino and styled by celebrity stylist Micaela Erlanger.

After an initial interest in phenomenology (Existence and structure: Essay on Merleau-Ponty, 1967), he decided to dedicate himself wholeheartedly to the study of analytic philosophy, particularly the philosophy of language. His major contributions have been concentrated in the area of formal semantics, especially in the field of the logic of epistemic, modal and temporal sentences. In particular, in Mental Events (1983), he proposed an original solution to the problem of the intentionality of propositional attitude attributions, based on the idea of perspectivity: the systematic ambiguity of interpretation which characterizes propositional attitude sentences is explained by way of the contrast between the point of view of the attributor and the point of view of the person who entertains the attitude attributed. Also of notable importance is his semantic analysis of fictitious contexts of language use (Universes of Discourse, 1979; The spirit of narration, 1994).

Syed Muhammad declared himself to be Imam Mahdi at the holy city of Mecca, in front of the Kaaba in 1496 and is revered as such by the Mahdavia community throughout the world, most of which is in India.  Beliefs  Mahdavis believe in oneness of Allah, the prophethood of Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah, and the Quran as their holy book. They strictly adhere to the five pillars of Islam, sunnah tradition, and sharia, while having high respect and reverence for the House of Muhammad and his immediate progeny (ahl-e bayt), the Rashidun caliphs, and the companions of Muhammad (sahaba). Mahdavis also respect all four schools of Islamic jurisprudence, but widely follow the traditions similar to Hanafi jurisprudence. They offer prayers five times a day led by their murshids, or spiritual guides; fast during Ramadan; offer special thanks on Dugana Laylat al-Qadr past midnight between 26 and 27 Ramadan; perform hajj; and pay zakat. They also attach great significance to zikr (remembrance of Allah), after dawn (fajr) prayers, and in the evening after asr prayer. Mahdavis, besides following the five pillars of Islam, also follow the seven obligations of sainthood, known as faraiz-e wilaya Muhammadiya. These obligations are: renunciation (tark-e dunya), quest for divine vision (talab didar-e Ilahi), company of truthfuls and ascetics (sohbat-e sadiqan), migration (hijrah), retreat and solitude (uzlat az khalq), absolute dependence on Allah (tawakkul), constant remembrance of Allah (zikr-e Ilahi) and distributing tithe (ushr). Followers of Jaunpuri strictly follow some of these obligations in their day-to-day life. Most of them initiate renunciation in the advanced stage of their lives, after getting retirement from the jobs or by handing over business to their heirs. Their renunciation is in any way not related to celibacy, because almost all of them get married. Mohammad Jaunpuri declared himself to be Promised Mahdi, and as such a \\"caliph of Allah\\". He claimed to teach the true inner meaning of the Qur'an and strictly adhere to the Sunnah of Muhammad. Jaunpuri's declaration was ignored by the ulema of Mecca, but after he repeated his declaration in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, he gained a group of followers and established a line of caliphs who led the movement after his death. After Jaunpuri's demise in 1505, the Mahdavi movement went through a militant phase, lasting during the reign of the first five Mahdavi caliphs. The movement was persecuted under the Sultan Muzaffar Shah II (r. 1511-1526) of Gujarat Sultanate. The second Mahdavi caliph, Bandagi Miyan Syed Khundmir and his fukhra disciples (the persons who renounce the world and keep remembering Allah with zikr), faced organised persecution by the regime of Muzaffar at the behest of his court-appointed Mullas and was killed in 1523 along with hundreds of unarmed and peaceful disciples. Syed Khundmir's tomb is located in the town of Champaner in the Panchmahal district of the western Indian state Gujarat, where thousands of seekers and followers, from different parts of India and other countries, arrive to pay tribute. After failure to re-appear in that year, the movement lost much of its fervor and entered a \\"quietist\\" phase, which lasted throughout the 17th century. In the 18th century, the movement mostly died out in northern India.Timothy R. Furnish, Holiest Wars: Islamic Mahdis, their Jihads, and Osama bin Laden, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005, pp 38–41. After the 1799 siege of Seringapatam, the British government invited the Mahdavis to re-settle in Mysore.L. K. A. Iyer, The Mysore: Tribes and Castes, Vol IV (1930), p. 383: \\"the benign British government issued a proclamation assuring peace and inviting all the Mahdavis to the territory of Mysore to resettle there, and they then settled in different places after their exile.\\"  Mahdavis  Diagram showing Mahdavia as well as other Muslim branches.  Zikris  Zikris are an offshoot of the Mahdavi movement found mostly in the Balochistan region of western Pakistan. \\"Mahdavis are estimated to number over 750,000 people. They live mostly in Makran and Las Bela in southern Pakistan, and are followers of a 15th-century mahdi, an Islamic messiah, called Nur Pak ('Pure Light'). Mahdavis practices and rituals differ from those of orthodox Islam...\\"Gall, Timothy L. (ed). Worldmark Encyclopedia of Culture & Daily Life. Vol. 3, Asia & Oceania. Cleveland, OH: Eastword Publications Development (1998); pg. 85 The content of their prayer, which they call Zikr-e-Elahi, refers to the worship of God. In addition to the Hajj, Zikris also visit (ziyarat) to the Koh-e-Murad (\\"Mountain of Desire\\" in Balochi), where their Promised Imam al-Mahdi Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri is believed to have stayed and in 1504 AD, he offered two Raka'as (cycles) special thanks giving prayers Dougana Laylat al-Qadr in the midnight of 27th Ramadan 908 Hijri. Following his tradition, including Zikris all Mahdavis offer Dougna Laylathu'l-Qadr prayers on 27th Ramadan midnight every year, under the leadership of their murshid. Thus, Mahdavis are a sect who follow the Sufi order, defined by the medieval saint Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri of the capital city of the Sharqi dynasty. This city was also known as The Shiraz of the East, due to its academic and intellectual eminence and the presence of many Islamic scholars in that era.  The population  The number of Mahdavis is not known with any confidence. Gall (1998) stated that they were \\"estimated to number over 750,000 people\\", \\" Mahdavis are estimated to number over 750,000 people.

The Mahdavis form a local majority in Pakistan's Gwadar District, and there are sizable communities in Karachi, the Pakistani part of Makran, Lasbela District, and Quetta, and in Pakistan's Sindh province. Their concentration in urban Karachi is due to many Mahdavis having relocated to the city, especially the neighborhood of Lyari Town. With the general rise of Islamic extremism and jihadism in the region since the 1980s, Mahdavis have been discriminated against, targeted, and killed by Sunni militants in Pakistan.\\"The Zikri question has become one of the leading issues during last few years which mobilized enormous resistance by the religious groups, particularly the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), in Balochistan\\" Mansoor Akbar Kundi, Balochistan, a socio-cultural and political analysis, Qasim Printers, 1993, p. 83. As a result, the Mahdavis community has been shrinking and becoming less visible, with many killed by the Sunni Hanafi. Non- governmental organizations including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) are working with local activists to create a greater awareness of the Mahdavis predicament. Recently, police protection has been provided to some Mahdavis pilgrims. Many Mahdavis have been killed by Sunni and Terrorist during fasting in Ramadan. The persecution of Mahdavis by Sunni militants as of 2014 has been part of the larger backlash against religious minorities in Pakistani Balochistan, targeting Hindus, Hazaras, Shias, and Zikris, resulting in the migration of over 300,000 Shias, Zikris, and Hindus from Pakistani Balochistan. The persecutions were due both to banned militant organizations such as Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and Pakistani Taliban. Mahdavia community in India Anjuman E Mahdavia is a Mahdavia community center in Hyderabad Telangana, India, established in 1902. L. K. A. Iyer in 1930 reports the existence of a community of \\"Mahdavia Musalmans\\" in Mysore Donabaghatta, Channapatna, Kirugavalu. There is a village named Donabaghatta in Karnataka.

She was nicknamed \\"the queen of Soviet sculpture\\".  Biography  Mukhina was born 1889 in Riga, Russian Empire into a wealthy merchant family, and lived at 23/25 Turgeneva Street, where a memorial plaque has now been placed. Mukhina's ancestors lived in Riga after the Patriotic War of 1812. The family was well-to-do: in 1937 Mukhina inherited 4 million lats from her grandfather.Vera Mukhina//The Russians of Latvia Retrieved 25 May 2020 She spent her childhood and youth (1892-1904) in Feodosia where her father took her considering his daughter's health (Vera was two years old when her mother died of tuberculosis).Vera Mukhina//the Russians of Latvia Retrieved 25 may 2020 In Feodosia the future artist received her first drawing and painting lessons. She lived there until 1904 when her father died. Mukhina and her older sister Maria were sheltered by uncles and aunts who lived in Kursk, where Mukhina went to high school which she graduated from with honors. On Christmas day of 1912 when Mukhina was staying at her uncle's place in the Smolensk province, she had an accident. While sledding down a hill, she crashed into a tree and her nose was cut off with a twig. She had a surgery in hospital in Smolensk but the scars remained on her face for good. Moreover, her girlish delicate face looked very different after eight subsequent plastic surgeries carried out by French surgeons. It acquired a masculine look with rough and strong-willed features. This accident had a tremendous effect on Mukhina’s life and her future career.The preserved heritage//The arguments and facts Retrieved 27 May 2020 She later moved to Moscow, where she studied at several private art schools, including those of Konstantin Yuon and Ilya Mashkov. In 1912 she traveled to Paris, where she attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and took lessons from Emile-Antoine Bourdelle, then continued on to Italy to explore the painting and sculpture of the Renaissance period. Mukhina returned to Moscow in summer 1914 two weeks before World War I began. Having taken nursing courses, she began working in a military hospital.Vera Mukhina museum in Feodosia//Kafanews Retrieved 27 May 2020 Here, also in 1914, she met the young military doctor Alexey Zamkov, whom she married in 1918.The preserved heritage//The arguments and facts Retrieved 27 May 2020 In 1915 and 1916, she served as assistant to Aleksandra Ekster at Alexander Tairov's Chamber Theater in Moscow. After the October Revolution in Russia the so- called \\"Lenin plan of monumental propaganda\\" was adopted. Sculptors received state orders to make city monuments. Mukhina in 1918 completed the project of the monument dedicated to the educator and publicist Nikolay Ivanovich Novikov. The project was approved by Narkompros, but the model of the monument made of clay and stored in an unheated workshop got cracked, and the project remained unfulfilled.Vera Mukhina//Tass Retrieved 27 May 2020 Within the framework of monumental propaganda Mukhina created sketches of the sculptures Liberated labor and Revolution (1919) as well as monuments to Vladimir Mikhailovich Zakorskiy (1921) and Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov (also known as The Flame of the Revolution, 1923).Vera Mukhina-The first lady of Russian Sculpture Retrieved 28 may 2020 In the 1920s Mukhina rose to become one of the Soviet Union's most prominent sculptors, and although she continued to produce Cubist sculpture as late as 1922, she became a leading figure of Socialist realism, both in style and ideology. In 1923 Mukhina together with Aleksandra Ekster designed the pavilion of the newspaper Izvestia at the first all-Russia agricultural and handicraft-industrial exhibition in Moscow. In 1925 Mukhina and Nadezhda Petrovna Lamanova,the fashion designer, received the Grand Prix at the exhibition in Paris for the collection of elegant women's clothing made of cheap coarse materials — cloth, calico, canvas and flannel, hats-from matting, belts decorated with colored peas, and buttons carved from wood. Dresses were decorated with original ornaments, including the \\"cock pattern\\" invented by Mukhina.Vera Mukhina museum in Feodosia//Kafanews Retrieved 27 may 2020 Mukhina taught at the state school Vkhutemas in 1926–1927, and in 1927–1930 she taught at the higher art and technical institute Vkhutein. In 1927 the sculpture Peasant woman created by Mukhina was awarded the first prize at the exhibition dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution. Later the sculpture was purchased by the Museum of Trieste, and after World War II it became the property of the Vatican Museums in Rome.Vera Mukhina//Tass Retrieved 27 May 2020 Mukhina came to the international attention with the 1937 Worker and Kolkhoz Woman. In 1938–1939 she worked on the sculptures for the Moskvoretsky Bridge, Hymn to the International, Flame of the Revolution, Sea, Land, Fertility, and Bread. Bread (1939) is the only composition made by Mukhina; the rest were recreated from sketches after her death. From October 1941 to April 1942 she lived and worked in the evacuation center in Kamensk-Uralsky. In 1945 Mukhina was invited to Riga as an expert to make a conclusion on the monument Freedom which was going to be demolished. She came out strongly in defense of the monument although her opinion contradicted that of the party and the monument was preserved. She is the creator of two monuments to Maxim Gorky: one of them was installed in 1943 in Moscow at the Belorussky Rail Terminal, the other was installed in 1952 in the city of Gorky. Another famous work by Mukhina is the monument to Tchaikovsky. It was installed in 1954 in the courtyard of the Moscow Conservatory on Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street. This sculptural composition is located in front of the main facade of the Conservatory and is the dominant feature of the entire architectural complex. Mukhina's work on official monuments and architectural sculpture on state commissions continued through her death. She also experimented with glass, producing glass figural busts. Seeking to enrich the artistic vocabulary of Soviet art. She often presented her theories on sculpture, experimented with new materials, and developed a technique of polychromatic sculpture. She decorated exhibitions, made industrial drawings, and designed clothes, textiles, porcelain and theatrical costumes for the Vakhtangov Theater in Moscow.https://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent- russians/art/vera-mukhina/ From 1941 to 1952, Mukhina won the Stalin Prize five times, and she was named People's Artist of the USSR in 1943. Because of Mukhina's influence as a great Soviet artist, and as a former student of the Latvian sculptor Kārlis Zāle, she persuaded Soviet officials in the late 1940s that the Freedom Monument in Riga was of great artistic importance. Due to her efforts, the monument was not demolished to make way for a statue of Joseph Stalin. In 1953 she wrote the book A Sculptor's Thoughts.Vera Mukhina, A Sculptor's Thoughts, translated from the Russian by Fainna Solasko, Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, 1953.  Death and legacy  Mukhina died in Moscow on 6 October 1953 of angina. She is buried in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.

Work = In Moscow  Theatrical costume design (1916) * Worker and Kolkhoz Woman Mukhina's most celebrated work by far is the giant monument Worker and Kolkhoz Woman, which was the centerpiece of the Soviet pavilion at the 1937 International Exhibition in Paris.Richard Overy, The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia, p. 260 Mukhina's monument crowned the Soviet pavilion designed by the architect Boris Mikhailovich Iofan. According to her plan, the sun frontally illuminated the monument, creating an effect of radiance. Both figures, for all their massiveness, seemed to fly. The feeling of flight was enhanced by a long fluttering scarf introduced by Mukhina into the composition. As a result, the sculpture group was distinguished by an unusual expression and energy, symbolizing the Soviet Union aspiring to new victories. The monument was called by the French press \\"the greatest work of sculpture of the XX century\\", and Pablo Picasso wrote: \\"How beautiful the Soviet giants are against the lilac Parisian sky\\".Vera Mukhina museum in Feodosia Retrieved 27 May 2020 It was the world's first welded sculpture.The history of welding The 24-meter-tall, 75-ton monument was made of plate of stainless steel on a wooden frame, the plates connected by an innovative method of spot welding. One hand of each figure holds respectively a hammer and a sickle, the two implements joining to form the hammer and sickle symbol of the Soviet Union. After the exhibition closed the monument was disassembled and taken back to Moscow. In 1939 it was installed near the north entrance of the all-Russia exhibition of national economy achievements VDNKH. However, Mukhina’s concept was altered: the monument was placed on a low pedestal and with its back to the sun and the feeling of flying was gone.

The round fruit is light yellow to red in colour, around 2–4 cm in size, and has a leathery shell. The flesh is soft and juicy, with a sweet taste and distinct aroma. The fruit comes from a small tree, seldom higher than 6 m, with an expansive crown of up to 10 m in diameter. The fruit of the imbu are round and can be of varying size: they can be as small as cherries or as large as lemons. The peel is smooth and green or yellow when the fruit ripen, the small firm fruits are juicy and flavorful and their succulent flesh hides a large dark pit. Etymology The name of this tree and fruit comes from the indigenous phrase y-mb-u, which means tree that gives drink. The productive cycle of this wild, spontaneously growing tree begins after ten years of growth. It bears fruit once a year and can produce up to 300 kilos of fruit in a single harvest when it reaches maturity. Due to its robust root system, a great network of tubers that can store liquid throughout the Sertão's dry season, the imbu tree can hold up to 3,000 liters of water during the dry months. Uses This tree is an important resource for one of the poorest and driest regions of Brazil, where local agriculture is based on corn, beans, sheep, and goat (dried and salted goat meat is one of the most important local foods). The fruit of the imbu tree is collected by hand gently, as it is easily damaged and during picking the fruits are set in baskets and bags (in the past these fruits were also collected by beating the branches with long poles, to the detriment of their flavor). Cooking and jam The imbu can be eaten fresh or made into jams or other sweetened preserves like fruit cheese. In the Sertão, it is cooked down until the peel and the pulp separate. Then, the liquid is poured off, it is mixed with sugar and cooked for another two hours. After the pulp has been reduced to a glossy gelatin (called geléia), it retains a slightly astringent flavor. In addition to the thick paste made by this long, slow boiling process, the imbu is the base of fruit juice, vinagre (the juice pressed from overripe fruit), and jam (made by pressing together layers of dried imbu paste). Another delicacy is the compôte made by mixing the fruit and sugar together in jars. The fresh pulp, or if the fresh fruit is not in season, the vinagre is mixed with milk and sugar to make umbuzada, a rich beverage that is a common substitute for a full meal. The fruit is ideal for mixing with gooseberries or plums and is used in fruit juices, jams and sorbets. Development Until a few years ago, no one paid much attention to this fruit. But the work of various organizations (the NGO IRPAA/PRO CUC, the KMB, the Austrian Lins diocese, and Austrian Horizon 3000) has improved the profile of imbu. These groups have worked to improve the public reputation of Caatinga products and have followed the development of the COOPER-CUC cooperative, which produces products that have no added flavors or colors in a small workshop in Uauá in the state of Bahia. The Presidium will draw up a production protocol that ensures the artisan quality of the products made from these fruits and raises the profile of the products on the national and international markets. The objectives extend beyond the improvement of the market for on-farm products to include the development of new work opportunities and new income, the protection of the environment, and the organizational potential of the local population, with a focus on jobs for women.

The cartel is one of several drug trafficking organizations that have been known to decapitate their rivals, mutilate their corpses and dump them in public places to instill fear not only into the general public, but also into local law enforcement and their rivals, the Sinaloa Cartel. Its last known leader was Juan Pablo Ledezma. The Juárez Cartel has an armed wing known as La Línea, a Juarez street gang that usually performs the executions. It also uses the Barrio Azteca gang to attack its enemies. The Juárez Cartel was the dominant player in the center of the country, controlling a large percentage of the cocaine traffic from Mexico into the United States. The death of Amado Carrillo Fuentes in 1997 was the beginning of the decline of the Juárez cartel, as Carrillo relied on ties to Mexico's top-ranking drug interdiction officer, division general Jesús Gutiérrez Rebollo.Mexican Drug Czar Fired, Charged With Drug Corruption.Cartel worker reportedly spied on DEA in Mexico In September 2011, the Mexican Federal Police reported that the cartel is now known as \\"Nuevo Cartel de Juárez\\" (New Juárez Cartel). It is alleged that the New Juárez Cartel is responsible for recent executions in Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua.Update: Leyzaola says New Juárez Cartel responsible for attacks on Juárez police El Paso Times (January 30, 2012) History The cartel was founded around the 1970s. When the leader Pablo Acosta Villarreal was killed in April 1987 during a cross-border raid by Mexican Federal Police helicopters in the Rio Grande village of Santa Elena, Chihuahua, Rafael Aguilar Guajardo took his place along with Amado Carrillo Fuentes, nephew of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. Guajardo was eventually betrayed and murdered by Fuentes in 1993 and Amado became the leader of Juarez. Amado brought his brothers and later his son into the business. After Amado died in 1997 following complications from plastic surgery, a brief turf war erupted over the control of the cartel, with Amado's brother, Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, becoming leader after defeating the Muñoz Talavera brothers. Vicente Carrillo Fuentes then formed a partnership with Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, his brother Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, his nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, Ricardo Garcia Urquiza, and formed an alliance with other drug lords such as Ismael \\"Mayo\\" Zambada in Sinaloa and Baja California, the Beltrán Leyva brothers in Monterrey, and Joaquín \\"El Chapo\\" Guzmán in Nayarit, Sinaloa and Tamaulipas. When Vicente took control of the cartel, the organization was in flux. The death of Amado created a large power vacuum in the Mexican underworld. The Carrillo Fuentes brothers became the most powerful organization during the 1990s while Vicente was able to avoid direct conflict and increase the strength of the Juárez Cartel. The relationship between the Carrillo Fuentes clan and the other members of the organization grew unstable towards the end of the 1990s and into the 2000s. During the 1990s and early 2000s, drug lords from contiguous Mexican states forged an alliance that became known as 'The Golden Triangle Alliance' or 'La Alianza Triángulo de Oro' because of its three-state area of influence: Chihuahua, south of the U.S. state of Texas, Durango and Sinaloa. However, this alliance was broken after the Sinaloa Cartel drug lord, Joaquín Guzmán Loera (aka: Shorty), refused to pay to the Juarez Cartel for the right to use some smuggling routes into the U.S. In 2001, after Joaquín Guzmán Loera 'El Chapo' escaped from prison, many Juárez Cartel members defected to Guzmán Loera's Sinaloa Cartel. In 2004, Vicente's brother was killed, allegedly by order of Guzmán Loera. Carrillo Fuentes retaliated by assassinating Guzmán's brother in prison. This ignited a turf war between the two cartels, which was more or less put on hold from 2005 to 2006 because of the Sinaloa Cartel's war against the Gulf Cartel. After the organization collapsed, some elements of it were incorporated into the Sinaloa Cartel, which absorbed much of the Juárez Cartel's former territory. The Juárez Cartel has been able to either corrupt or intimidate high-ranking officials in order to obtain information on law enforcement operatives and acquire protection from the police and judicial systems. The Juárez cartel has been found to operate in 21 Mexican states. Its principal bases are Culiacán, Monterrey, Ciudad Juárez, Ojinaga, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Cuernavaca and Cancún. Members of the cartel were implicated in the serial murder site in Ciudad Juárez that was discovered in 2004 and has been dubbed the House of Death. Since 2007, the Juárez Cartel has been locked in a vicious battle with its former partner, the Sinaloa Cartel, for control of Juárez. The fighting between them has left thousands dead in Chihuahua. The Juárez Cartel relies on two enforcement gangs to exercise control over both sides of the border: La Linea, a group of corrupt (current and former) Chihuahua police officers, is prevalent on the Mexican side, while the Barrio Azteca street gang operates in Mexico and in Texan cities such as El Paso, Dallas and Houston, as well as in New Mexico and Arizona. On July 15, 2010, the Juárez Cartel escalated violence to a new level by using a car bomb to target federal police officers. In September 2011 banners were displayed, publicizing the return of the extinct cartel. They were signed by Cesar \\"El Gato\\" Carrillo Leyva, who appears to be the son or a close relative of the late drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Prior to 2012, the Juárez Cartel controlled one of the primary transportation routes for billions of dollars' worth of illegal drug shipments annually entering the United States from Mexico. Since then, however, control of these areas has shifted to the Sinaloa Cartel.Which cartel is king in Mexico? January 5, 2012 On September 1, 2013, the Mexican forces arrested Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, alias Betty la Fea (\\"Ugly Betty\\"), in the western state of Nayarit. He had taken the leadership of the organization in 2013 after his brother Vicente Carrillo Fuentes (fugitive until his arrest in October 2014) retired following a reported illness. The Mexican government has auctioned off the villa of the late drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes. The Mexico City home sold for more than $2m (£1.6m) and the proceeds will go to Mexico's public health service and its fight against coronavirus.  Current alliances  Since March 2010, it is alleged that the major cartels have aligned into two loosely allied factions, one integrated by the Juárez Cartel, Tijuana Cartel, Los Zetas and the Beltrán-Leyva Cartel; the other faction integrated by the Gulf Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel and the now disbanded La Familia Cartel. In 2019, it was revealed that notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman put a bounty on Juarez Cartel leader Juan Pablo Ledezma for ending the Juarez Cartel's alliance with his Sinaloa Cartel.  Decline.  By 2018, the Juárez Cartel's power declined in its home region of Ciudad Juárezhttps://www.insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/barrio-azteca- profile/ In June 2020, it was reported that La Línea was the Juárez Cartel's most powerful fraction in Ciudad Juárez.https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/jalisco-cartel-dominate- mexico/ However, Los Salazar, a powerful cell of the Sinaloa Cartel, had by this point managed to build a significant presence in Ciudad Juárez as well. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel also made its presence in Ciudad Juárez with its New Juarez Cartel, though it failed to deter the hold which La Linea and Los Salazar had over the Ciudad Juárez drug trafficking market as well.  Media portrayal  A fictional Juárez Cartel was featured battling a fictional Tijuana Cartel headed by a character named Obregon in the 2000 motion picture Traffic. A fictional Juárez Cartel appears in AMC television series Breaking Bad and its prequel Better Call Saul as recurring antagonists. The Australian ABC documentary La Frontera (2010) described the social impact of the cartel in the region. A fictional Juarez Cartel appears in Tom Clancy's novel Against All Enemies (2011). It is secretly led by Mexican billionaire Jorge Rojas, who derived the name from its original founder Enrique Juarez. Juarez had established a pharmaceutical company in which Rojas is an investor. Rojas later arranged to produce black-market versions of pharmaceutical drugs, turning in more profit. After Juarez objects to the production, Rojas later had him killed in a skiing \\"accident\\" which allowed him to take over the company and turn it into a full-fledged drug cartel that made him one of the richest men in the world.

The name is derived from the term lurker, which creator J. Michael Straczynski adopted to refer to the underclass residents on the Babylon 5 station. Structure The Lurker's Guide has five major sections, starting with \\"The Babylon 5 Universe\\". This section introduces the show and gives background on historical events in the series' timeline that shaped its political and social climate. There are also sections for resources and references and detailed information on the production of the show. The heart of The Guide lies in the individual episode listings. Each episode and telefilm has a synopsis page, a background page (providing a description and explanation of the story arc up to that episode) and detailed cast and crew credits. The main guide page contains a \\"backplot\\" section, which shows how the episode relates to the overall story arc, a section for unanswered questions from the episode, a detailed analysis section, plus a section on miscellaneous notes. Each article concludes with a \\"JMS Speaks\\" section, which contains Straczynski's comments about the episode, gathered from various online forums on which he posted. History The Guide was created by Steven Grimm around early 1993, long before the pilot aired, as a FAQ posted on Usenet. A website was set up, but when the FAQ became too cumbersome, The Guide was born. Grimm maintained the site, with contributions from several fans over the years. During the run of Babylon 5, The Lurker's Guide was updated, adding new facts and insights whenever they became available. Although the site is not updated as frequently since the series' end, it still serves as a record and reference of the fan experience surrounding Babylon 5. Straczynski commented that even he used the site for quick reference, calling it an \\"invaluable resource\\". Legacy The Guide and its associated FTP archive used to be located at hyperion.com before Grimm lost the domain. In the first-season episode \\"A Voice in the Wilderness\\", Straczynski named the EAS Hyperion cruiser after the site. In an early piece on the World Wide Web, The Washington Post noted The Lurker's Guide as a \\"Star Trek\\" (sic) resource accessible through www.infi.net/cool.html. In 1997, when TV Guide ran a cover story on Babylon 5, The Guide was one of the websites featured in a special sidebar. On the Babylon 5 Season 5 DVD, Straczynski also acknowledged The Lurker's Guide and Grimm for his years of help and support, illustrating The Guide's significant central role in the development of Babylon 5 fandom and the series itself. In 1998 The Booklist wrote that The Lurker's Guide \\"deserves special attention as an example of an outstanding site devoted to an extraordinary show.\\" See also * Babylon 5's use of the Internet * rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated ReferencesFurther reading  External links *The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 *Deutscher Lurker's Guide (in German) Category:Babylon 5 Category:Television websites Category:Science fiction websites ","title":"The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5"},{"id":"4467620","text":"Unique One is a 2004 Japanese horror film directed by Takashi Shimizu. Plot Masuoka (Shinya Tsukamoto) carries a camera everywhere he goes. He becomes obsessed with the idea of fear after seeing a frightened man shove a knife into his eye to commit suicide. Wishing to understand the fear that the man must have felt before his death, Masuoka descends into a labyrinthine underground area beneath the city, where he sees human-like creatures that walk on their hands and knees and whimper like dogs. While searching the tunnels and passages, Masuoka encounters a homeless inhabitant who warns him about the \\"Deros\\". He then meets the ghost of Kuroki, the man who killed himself, and learns more about the underworld. After hours of searching, Masuoka discovers a mountain range with a village built by the underground dwellers. He finds a naked girl (Tomomi Miyashita) chained to a wall. He takes her back to his apartment and notices she doesn't eat, drink, or speak. The girl, whom Masuoka dubs 'F', appears to be something other than human, and Masuoka becomes obsessed with understanding her. He sets up cameras that enable him to observe her from his cell phone when he leaves the apartment, and checks on her regularly. On a trip to the shopping mall, Masuoka sees F speaking to someone off camera, and a menacing man in black appears behind him. When he returns to the apartment, a woman in a yellow jacket is hiding in the stairway outside his door. Inside, Masuoka finds F in convulsions and unsuccessfully attempts to feed her. He discovers that twelve seconds of camera footage is missing, and receives a mysterious phone call from a payphone warning him that he is in serious trouble. After being beaten with his camera by a stranger whom he filmed, Masuoka cuts his finger on the broken lens and returns home. He discovers that F survives on blood when she licks his finger, and cuts himself to feed her further. Masuoka begins to care for her by providing animal carcasses, deciding to treat F more as a pet than a human. The woman in yellow confronts him in the street, saying the girl is his daughter Fuyumi and asking where she is. Masuoka denies having a daughter and runs away, returning to the apartment to find it has been broken into and F has vanished. He wanders the streets searching for F and encounters the man in black, who expresses his disappointment in Masuoka's handling of her, speaking to him telepathically in the same voice as in the phone call. When Masuoka gets back to the apartment, he finds that F has returned and sees her hands are bloody. When Masuoka leaves his apartment, the woman in yellow follows and demands that he speak to her. He walks to an alley without speaking, and turns his camera on. The woman says she wants to see her girl, at which point Masuoka stabs her to death. Later, he murders a young girl whom he met under the pretense of filming pornography. He drains their blood into bottles and feeds it to F. Masuoka calls the payphone and speaks to the stranger, who agrees that Masuoka is taking better care of F now. While filming for a news crew at the scene of the second murder, Masuoka sees a woman he filmed in her apartment previously. He takes F out of the apartment, and leaves her in a karaoke room to travel on his own for a period. Sitting on a dock, Masuoka discusses his interest in fear with Kuroki. Masuoka becomes homeless and sleeps in the park where he killed the young girl. He briefly admits to himself that he murdered his wife and a stranger and treated his daughter like an animal, before seeing a pair of Deros and finding a cell phone that leads him back to his apartment to find F. His wife's ghost appears behind Masuoka in the elevator, and he enters the apartment to find F weak on the floor. F speaks to him for the first time, and he cuts his mouth at the corner to feed her. At the end of the film, F leads Masuoka back down into the underworld, and films him as it appears he has finally discovered the same fear that initially intrigued him. Critical analysis At different points in the film, different explanations are given for what is happening to Masuoka. Early conversations in the film seem to suggest that the tunnels and F herself may be a physical manifestation of human ideas. The film repeatedly references dangerous creatures called the Dero who live underground, named after the \\"detrimental robots\\" in Richard Sharpe Shaver's A Warning to Future Man. At a later point in the film, it is suggested that Masuoka is insane and delusional, perhaps because he has stopped taking Prozac, and that his delusions have led him to kill innocent people and treat his daughter like an animal. The end of the film offers no concrete explanation. In their book Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft, Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: \\"Marebito is a very good film that wears its influences proudly, without suffocating in their embrace. It's neither an adaptation nor an homage, but it swells with inspiration from Lovecraft's work. It's unconventional, free from cliché, and redolent with sinister insinuations that never become clear.

He was FUMA's most valuable player for the postgraduate squad under coach Fletcher Arritt, also being voted the number one player in the state for varsity basketball; he averaged 19 points, 12 rebounds and six blocked shots, being inducted into the Fork Union Military Academy Hall of Fame in 2000.FUMA Sports Hall of Fame ; Fork Union At the University of Kentucky, Turpin made the 1st Team All-SEC for 1982 and 1983 and was a starter for the NCAA Final Four Kentucky Wildcats team in 1983–84. In 1984, he was the Southeastern Conference scoring leader, holding the record for the most field goals made in SEC tournament play in addition to co-holding the honor of the most points scored in a single tournament game. Turpin scored 42 points in a game against University of Tennessee as a junior, making 18 of 22 shots from the field; he similarly dominated Louisiana State University as a senior, shooting 15 of 17 from the floor and five of six from the free throw line.A sea of blue In 1984, Turpin was chosen as the sixth overall pick in the first round by the Washington Bullets in the NBA Draft, being immediately traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. As a professional, however, he struggled with his weight, and after six seasons with the Cavaliers, the Utah Jazz, CAI Zaragoza and the Bullets, he retired. Earning the derisive nicknames \\"Dinner Bell Mel\\" and \\"The Mealman\\", Turpin was considered one of the biggest busts in a draft class that included future greats such as Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and John Stockton.Biggest draft busts In a 2004 Sports Illustrated article, Turpin quipped, \\"In my day, they thought the big man was supposed to be thin.

Death For a time during the 2000s, Turpin worked as a security guard. On July 8, 2010, he committed suicide in his Lexington home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. The reason for his suicide was never determined. Also, it was never made public if he left a suicide note.

It is usually dark gray or brown with little or no markings, although a dorsal color pattern consisting of 10 to 15 dark crossbands can be seen in some specimens. Like other members of the species, its color darkens with age, and very old specimens may appear entirely black. Unlike the other two subspecies (A. p. conanti and A. p. piscivorus), the light line that borders the dark cheek strip is usually not present in this subspecies. The dorsal scales are keeled, in rows of 25 near the midbody, and the anal scale is undivided. Its broad, flat head is distinctly wider than its neck, and it has an elliptical (cat- like) pupil. By day the pupil appears as a narrow slit; at night the pupil is wide and may even look round.

To the east, Perry Lakes reserve is directly adjacent to the park. The hilly topography allows views of both the city and ocean. History The Perth City Council established Bold Park in 1936. It was named after William E. Bold on 14 November 1944, who served as town clerk from 1900 to 1944 (the longest serving town clerk in the council's history). Bold Park is located on a calcareous coastal plain. Limestone formations in the park were quarried to provide stone for the growing population of Perth. The 640-person-capacity Quarry Amphitheatre uses quarry walls for acoustics and shelter. Bold Park was recognised as an A-class reserve on . Since 2000, the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority (BGPA) has managed Bold Park (along with the 406-hectare Kings Park). Frequent fires, recreational activities and weed invasion have plagued Perth's urban bushland areas. The Bold Park Environmental Management Plan (2000–2005) committed the BGPA to restoring the park.

It is generally illegal to carry a gun outside a residence, and a special permit granting the right to do so is granted to certain groups, such as law enforcement officers. For citizens to legally own a gun, they must have a gun license, which costs R$88,00 and pay a fee every ten years to renew the gun register. The registration can be done online or in person with the Federal Police. Until 2008, unregistered guns could be legalized for free. It is estimated that there are around 17 million firearms in Brazil, 9 million of which are unregistered. Some 39,000 people died in 2003 from gun-related injuries nationwide. In 2004, the number was 36,000. Brazil has the second largest arms industry in the Western Hemisphere. Approximately 80% of the weapons manufactured in Brazil are exported, mostly to neighboring countries; many of these weapons are then smuggled back into Brazil. Some firearms in Brazil come from police and military arsenals, having either been \\"stolen or sold by corrupt soldiers and officers.\\" In 2005, a majority of Brazil's population voted against banning the sale of guns and ammunition to civilians in a referendum. Executive Order 5.123, of 1 July 2004 allowed the Federal Police to confiscate firearms which are not possessed for a valid reason; self-defense was not considered a valid argument. These measures saw mixed results. Initially, the crime rate dropped, but subsequently rose in later years. 2012 marked the highest rate of gun deaths in 35 years for Brazil, eight years after a ban on carrying handguns in public went into effect, and 2016 saw the worst ever death toll from homicide in Brazil, with 61,619 dead. The death toll rose again in 2017 to 63,880, a 3.7% rise from 2016. After the flexibility of guns in 2019 by President Jair Bolsonaro, the number of deaths registered by homicide was 19% lower compared to 2018 (51,558), while in 2019 the registered number was 41,635 being the lowest number of homicide deaths since 2007. Current President Jair Bolsonaro is strongly in favor of repealing the disarmament law and allowing citizens to own and carry guns for defense. On 15 January 2019, Bolsonaro signed the first decree to facilitate the purchase of guns. The decree increases the valid gun ownership period from five to ten years and allows citizens to own up to four firearms. In order to own firearms, a citizen will have to provide proof of the \\"existence of a safe or a secure location for storage\\" of the weapon at home. Requirements for possession such as passing training courses and background checks remain, as does the minimum age requirement of 25 years. The decree does not affect restrictions for gun carry, only for possession. On 7 May 2019, Bolsonaro signed an additional decree which allows for rural gun owners to use their guns on their own property; allowing additional arms imports into Brazil; allowing collectors, sports shooters, and hunters to travel from their homes to shootings ranges with their firearms and ammunition; entitling stabilized military with ten or more years experience to bear firearms; and increasing the right to purchase cartridges a year from 50 to 5000 and to 1000 for restricted weapons.

The house was built by Sir Toby Caulfeild between 1611 and 1619. He was granted 1000 acres during the Ulster Plantation. This land was previously owned by the O'Donnelly family, who were closely connected to the O'Neill clan in Dungannon. The O'Donnelly fort was a few miles West of the castle. The building was three storeys high with attics, a cellar, many large mullioned windows and tall chimneystacks. A joist from one of the walls was dated using dendrochronology to about 1282 and may belong to an earlier fort. There are substantial remains. The gatehouse was rebuilt at a later date, although one of the doorways may be reused. The Caulfeild arms appear over the entrance. Castle Caulfield was burned in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 but was repaired and reoccupied by the Caulfeilds until the 1660s. Oliver Plunkett is known to have held a service at the castle in 1670, but the castle was in ruins when John Wesley preached there in 1767.

Initially a tropical depression, the system moved north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry early on the following day. Jerry continuously deepened until October 14 and then maintained intensity while curving northeastward and briefly decelerating. Later that day, the storm re-curved north-northwestward. Jerry began to intensify on October 15 and soon became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early on October 16, Jerry made landfall on Galveston Island, Texas with winds of . Less than six hours later, Jerry weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression shortly thereafter. Late on October 16, Jerry was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over southwestern Arkansas. Storm surge and rough surf along the coast of Texas destroyed a section of Texas State Highway 87, which was never repaired. Due to strong winds, about 52,000 homes and businesses were left without electricity, most of them in the Galveston area. Many homes, businesses, and buildings were inflicted damage because of strong winds and three tornadoes spawned by the storm. Despite the issuance of a hurricane warning just eight hours prior to landfall, Jerry caused only three fatalities in Texas, possibly due to the storm's small size; a car fell over the Galveston Seawall, killing its three occupants. Minor wind and coastal flood damage was reported in Louisiana. Jerry and its remnants brought flash flooding to portions of the Upland South, particularly in the states of Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. In eastern Kentucky, hundreds of homes were flooded and many bridges, culverts, and roads were washed out; this left hundreds of residents stranded. Damage in Kentucky reached at least $5 million. Similar impact occurred in Virginia; with $3.4 million (1989 USD) in damage in Buchanan County. In West Virginia, overflowing rivers in the western portions of the state forced hundreds to evacuate. Throughout the United States, Jerry resulted in about $70 million in damage. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the coast of northwest Africa on September 23. No additional signs of tropical cyclogenesis were observed as the tropical wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean or the Caribbean Sea. The tropical wave decelerated upon reaching the Yucatán Peninsula, where it became a broad low pressure area, based on surface pressure fields and convective motions indicated in satellite imagery. While emerging into the Bay of Campeche on October 12, the intensity of the low was estimated via Dvorak technique. At 1900 UTC on October 12, a reconnaissance aircraft flight confirmed an atmospheric circulation, and the system was then classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen. However, post-analysis indicates that the depression developed seven hours earlier, while located about east-northeast of Veracruz, Veracruz. While moving north-northwestward, satellite and reconnaissance aircraft reports indicated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry early on October 13\\\\. Jerry then gradually intensified and moved northward between . Early on October 14, the storm turned to the north-northeast and decelerated in response to an approaching mid- to upper- level trough. Increasing upper-level wind shear temporarily limited further intensification. However, after a mid- to upper-level cut-off low pressure area moved southward, the upper-level outflow pattern became more favorable, causing Jerry to resume strengthening. The cut-off low then forced Jerry to re-curve north-northwestward, while stronger steering currents and a high pressure ridge increased the storm's forward motion to more than . While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States, deep convection began to develop near the center, and by 1800 UTC on October 15, Jerry strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane. After reaching hurricane status late on October 15, the storm continued to intensify while approaching the coast of Texas. At 2100 UTC, Jerry attained its minimum barometric pressure of . The storm strengthened slightly further before making landfall on Galveston Island near Jamaica Beach, Texas with winds of at 0030 UTC on October 16\\\\. Jerry's landfall is among the latest dates in the satellite era that a hurricane struck the upper Texas coast. After moving inland, the storm then accelerated while turning toward the north and then north-northeastward. At 0600 UTC on October 16, Jerry weakened to a tropical storm and to a tropical depression about six hours later. Late on October 16, the cyclone was absorbed by a frontal system over southwestern Arkansas. Preparations The forecast models of Jerry were never close to the hurricane's actual landfall Jerry was an unpredictable storm as the strengthening before landfall and the continuation to the northwest were not anticipated. Equipment failure meant that data was not readily available. The National Hurricane Center forecast model was also disabled, throwing the accuracy of Jerry's track off. Tropical cyclone warnings and watches began early on October 14, with a hurricane watch for Port Arthur, Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. At 2200 UTC later that day, a tropical storm watch was issued for the entire coast of Louisiana. Another tropical storm watch was posted from Port O'Connor, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana at 1200 UTC on October 15. Due to the unpredictability of the storm, a hurricane warning was issued from Freeport, Texas to Intracoastal City, Louisiana at 1600 UTC, only eight hours prior to landfall. Simultaneously, two separate tropical storm warnings were posted, from Matagorda to Freeport and Intracoastal City to Morgan City. Although the storm had already made landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued from Freeport to Intracoastal City at 0400 UTC on October 16\\\\. By six hours later, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued. About 4,000 oil company employees were evacuated off the rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, at least 1,300 of them by helicopter. In Louisiana, approximately 8,000 people evacuated - 1,000 from Grand Isle and 7,000 others from Cameron Parish. Impact=Texas Rainfall totals from Hurricane Jerry Rainfall from Hurricane Jerry peaked at in Silsbee. Jerry caused light beach erosion along the Texas coast. The storm destroyed a section of Texas State Highway 87, between High Island and Sabine Pass. As of 2018, the destroyed section of the highway has not been repaired, despite plans for it to be rebuilt. In Galveston County, abnormally high astronomical tides and rough surf from Jerry resulted in coastal flood damage. Beach erosion was reported, while some sand dunes were flattened. On the western end of Galveston Island, beachfront roads were inundated and covered with debris, glass, and boards. In Brazoria County, high tides caused minor road damage in Surfside Beach. Storm surge in Chambers County caused coastal flooding in Anahuac. Three people were killed when their car was either blown or washed off the Galveston Seawall during the storm. The eye of the Hurricane went directly over Kemah where waterfront businesses suffered considerable damage, including restaurants, boat docks, and bait stands. Property losses in the city of Kemah was estimated to have reached $2 million. In the upper end of Galveston Bay in Harris County, businesses in low-lying areas were affected by coastal flooding. At Scholes Field, sustained winds of and gusts up to were observed, ripping doors off the hangars. A walkway and four boats were damaged at the Hanks Creek Marina, located on the eastern shore of Sam Rayburn Reservoir, while the marina itself was deroofed. Similar impact was reported at the nearby Shirley Creek Marina. Strong winds destroyed four high steel towers, which supported power lines that traversed the northern Galveston Bay near the Houston Ship Channel. Elsewhere in eastern Texas, wind damage was relatively minor, mainly limited to shattered windows, toppled trees and power lines, and generally light impact to houses, mobile homes, buildings, farm buildings, and businesses in several counties in eastern Texas. Falling trees blocked numerous roads and struck houses and power lines, leaving approximately 52,000 homes and businesses without electricity, most of them in the Galveston area. There were three tornadoes in the county, the first of which unroofed some buildings in Galveston. The second tornado, also touching down in Galveston, inflicted roof damage to many businesses, homes, and apartment complexes. The third tornado, spawned in League City, toppled several trees and a flag pole. In Chambers County a tornado near Kemah inflicted damage to a beach house. Another tornado in the county spawned in downtown Baytown shattered windows at a hospital, a mall, and store windows. In Polk County, a small tornado caused minor damage, totaling $10,000. Elsewhere In Louisiana, tides ranging from above normal lashed the coast. However, coastal flooding damage was minimal. Gusty winds in the northwestern portion of the state downed some trees and power lines. Jerry and its remnants dropped rainfall in several other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia. Similar rainfall was reported in Kentucky, ranging from . Flash flooding caused significant damage in several counties. Numerous roads and bridges were washed out. Hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed, forcing hundreds to evacuate. Additionally, many cars were damaged or swept away. The Kentucky River overflowed at Hazard in Perry County, inundating a number of streets with up to of water. About ten families were forced to evacuate. Damage in Perry County exceeded $1 million. In neighboring Letcher County, 100 bridges and culverts were washed out, while about 50 homes were impacted by flooding. Damage in the county reached $2 million. In Floyd County, over 750 students and teachers were stranded at a school in McDowell after the Frasure Creek overflowed, inundating several classrooms with over of water. Over 200 homes were flooded and many bridges and roads washed in Pike County, with damage reaching $2 million. Many residents were left isolated in eastern Kentucky after flooding destroyed bridges and roads. According to state disaster assessment teams, hundreds of residents in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia had flood damage to their houses. Due to the impact from flooding in eastern Kentucky, President George H. W. Bush declared Clay, Floyd, Jackson, Knott, Knox, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Owsley, Perry and Pike counties as disaster areas. Heavy rains in West Virginia overflowed the Tug Fork and Guyandotte rivers. About 150 homes were evacuated in Matewan, where the Tug Fork River crested at above its banks. Farther south in Williamson, the river overflowed its banks by about . On October 19, Governor of West Virginia Gaston Caperton toured flood-ravaged areas of the state, including Mingo and Logan counties. Heavy rainfall extended eastward into extreme western Virginia. In northern Buchanan County, flash flooding destroyed or heavily damaged numerous businesses and homes. Additionally, many private bridges were swept away and more than 100 roads were inundated. Approximately 30 families were evacuated in the Hurley area, where up to of precipitation was observed. Damage in Buchanan County totaled $3.4 million. President Bush declared Buchanan County as a disaster area on November 8.

His real name was , but he is best known by his artistic name, Rosanjin. A man of many talents, Rosanjin was also a calligrapher, ceramicist, engraver, painter, lacquer artist and restaurateur. Biography Rosanjin was born in what is now part of Kita-ku, Kyoto, as the younger son of the head priest of Kamigamo Shrine. At the age of six, he was apprenticed to (and adopted by) Fukuda Takeshi, a Kyoto woodblock engraver, after his father committed suicide on finding out that the child was not his own son. At the age of ten, while still in elementary school, he was also working at a local Chinese herbalist. In 1903, Rosanjin moved to Tokyo with the intent of studying Japanese calligraphy, winning first prize in a contest by the Japan Art Academy the following year. In 1905, he was accepted as an apprentice by noted calligrapher Okamoto Ippei, who sent him to northern China from 1908-1910 to study calligraphy and the art of Seal cutting. In 1915, Rosanjin moved to Kyoto and Kanazawa, where he first began experimenting with decorated ceramics and developing his aesthetic theories on the relationship between food and the design of the ceramics on which it was served. In 1919, he returned to Tokyo, where he opened an art gallery and in 1920 he founded the Bishoku Club (Gourmet's Club) on the second floor of his gallery, where he began serving food on his collection of traditional ceramics. In 1925, the restaurant moved to the Nagatachō neighborhood of Tokyo, where it was renamed the Hoshigaoka-saryo. However, the Great Tokyo earthquake of 1923 destroyed most of his ceramics collection, so Rosanjin began making pottery to replace it. In 1926, with the assistance of Toyozō Arakawa, he established a kiln in the Yamasaki neighborhood of Kamakura. Rosanjin began by imitating the classic forms of Japanese Mino, Shigaraki, Bizen and Kutani ceramics, and also for classic blue-and-white wares and colored porcelains of Ming period China. However, he often surpassed the classical forms, and became famous for his simple, but daring, original designs, at time incorporating elements of Japanese calligraphy, of which he was also an acknowledged master. Rosanjin was also noted as a scholar of antique pottery publicizing his work in a privately published periodical, Hoshigaoka, during the 1930s. In the post-war period, despite some financial difficulties, in 1946 Rosanjin opened a restaurant in the Ginza district of Tokyo called Kadōkadō-byō. It was patronized by the upper levels of the American occupation forces, and helped establish Ryosanjin’s reputation overseas. In 1951, noted sculptor Isamu Noguchi and his actress wife Yoshiko Ōtaka accepted an invitation to live on Rosanjin’s property in Kamakura, where they stayed for several years. Rosanjin launched a quarterly magazine, Doppo, in 1954. Also in 1954, Rosanjin accepted an invitation by the Rockefeller Foundation to hold a solo exhibition of his works in New York City at the Museum of Modern Art. He continued on to Europe, where he met with Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. In 1955, one of his Oribe ware works was designated an Important Cultural Property of Japan by the Japanese government. Rosanjin was designated a Living National Treasure by the Japanese government in 1959, but was one of the very few people to decline the honor. Rosanjin died in Yokohama in 1959 of cirrhosis of the liver brought about by a liver fluke infection. His grave is at the temple of Saihō-ji in Kyoto. In popular culture In the manga Oishinbo, the character Kaibara Yuzan is modeled after Rosanjin.L.

Much of the building was constructed using old timber repurposed from other buildings. On October 13, 1690, Maule conveyed the Meeting House and land for £45 to Josiah and Daniel Southwick (sons of persecuted and banished Quakers Lawrence Southwick and Cassandra Burnell Southwick), Samuel Gaskill (husband of the Southwick's daughter Provided), Caleb Buffum, Christopher Foster, and Sarah Stone. Meetings were held in this building for nearly 30 years. Despite the small number of attendees, by 1714 additions were made after the Meeting House was considered inadequate in size. On October 3, 1716, the four surviving deed-holding Friends agreed to sell the Meeting House and land back to Maule for £25. Over the years, until sometime around 1860 when it was moved to the grounds of the Essex Institute, the building was used as a small home by several families, a barn, cow barn, hen house, and finally a wood shed. Several children were born in the building between 1775-1787. The current building, now part of the Peabody Essex Museum and erected in 1865 to resemble a Post-Medieval or First Period structure, is a reconstruction of the Quaker Meeting House and may contain some of the original timber framing.

Building regulations approval is required for most building work in the UK. Building regulations that apply across England and Wales are set out in the Building Act 1984 while those that apply across Scotland are set out in the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act in England and Wales permits detailed regulations to be made by the Secretary of State. The regulations made under the Act have been periodically updated, rewritten or consolidated, with the latest and current version being the Building Regulations 2010. The UK Government (at Westminster) is responsible for the relevant legislation and administration in England, the Welsh Government (at Cardiff) is the responsible body in Wales, the Scottish Government (at Edinburgh) is responsible for the issue in Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Executive (at Belfast) has responsibility within its jurisdiction. There are very similar (and technically very comparable) Building Regulations in the Republic of Ireland. The detailed requirements of Building regulations in England (and Wales) are scheduled within 16 separate headings, each designated by a letter (Part A to Part Q), and covering aspects such as workmanship, adequate materials, structure, waterproofing and weatherisation, fire safety and means of escape, sound isolation, ventilation, safe (potable) water, protection from falling, drainage, sanitary facilities, accessibility and facilities for the disabled, electrical safety, security of a building, and high speed broadband infrastructure. For each Part, detailed specifications are available free online (in the English and Welsh governments' \\"approved documents\\") describing the matters to be taken into account. The approved documents are not literally legally binding in how the requirements must be met; rather, they present the expectation of the Secretary of State concerning the minimum appropriate standards required for compliance with the Building Regulations, and the common methods & materials used to achieve these. The use of appropriate British Standards and/or European Standards is also accepted as one way of complying with the Building Regulations requirements. However, the supply of gas (natural and/or LPG) is not controlled by the Building Regulations, as there are separate Gas Safety Regulations enforced by the Health and Safety Executive HSE). Newer versions of Building Regulations are generally not retrospective, they are applied to each new change or modification to a building (or new part of a building) but do not require renovation of existing elements. There are general requirements for any change or improvement, that the building must not be left any less satisfactory in compliance than before the works, and areas worked on must not be left in unsafe condition by reference to current standards. The Regulations may also specify in some cases, that when enough work is done in an area (such as partial new insulation) the remainder of that area must be brought to an appropriate standard, however the standard required for an existing building may be less stringent than that required for a completely new building. The Regulations also specify, that some types of work must be undertaken by an appropriate qualified professional (such as works on gas or certain electrical matters), or must be notified to the relevant local authority's Building regulations approval for certification or approval. However, it should be remembered that the Building regulations are separate and distinct from 'Town Planning' and 'planning permission'; the building regulations control how buildings are to be designed or modified on the public grounds of safety and sustainability while 'planning permission' is concerned with appropriate development the nature of land usage, and the appearance of neighbourhoods. Therefore, both must be considered when building works are to be undertaken. History and timeline of changes From 1 January 2005 the term building work includes work on household electrics. The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 made provision for microgeneration to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on compliance with these aspects of the Building Regulations and steps proposed to increase compliance. However, no such regulations have been laid. From 6 April 2006, the Building Regulations are extended by amendments to incorporate some of the European Directives requiring energy in existing and new buildings to be measured, etc. The core term building work was once again amended and extended in scope to include renovation of thermal elements, and energy used by space cooling systems as well as energy used by space heating systems. Both are now subject to efficiency limits, and energy use controls are required. New additional competent persons schemes were proposed and authorised, in respect of energy systems and energy efficient design. * A total rewrite of Approved Document for Part P (Electrical Safety) was also issued in 2006. * New Approved Documents for Part F and Part L were issued along with specified 'second tier' guidance documents was also issued in 2006. * A total rewrite of the Building Regulations was issued in 2010. However, this has since been amended several times again, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 & 2018\\\\. * In December 2011, building regulation powers for Wales were devolved enabling Welsh ministers the power to make building regulations in Wales.https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/devolution-of-wales-and-split-of- building-regulations-powers Subsequent amendments by both the UK government regarding the building regulations in England and by the Welsh Government for Wales have caused the building regulations for the two countries to begin to diverge. * A total rewrite of Approved Document for Part K (Protection against Falling, & Glazing Safety, etc.) was also issued in 2012/2013. This new Part K now incorporates all that once was within Part N (Glazing Safety) comes into force, on 1.10.15.. * 2015 - Part Q (\\"security\\") comes into force, on 1.10.15. * 2017 - Part R (\\"High Speed Broadband Infrastructure\\") comes into force on 01.01.2017. * 2018 - A number of regulations were amended or created to introduce a restriction on the use of combustible materials within external elevations and specific attachments in certain types of buildings with storeys over 18m - this applied in England only.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/760349/Building__Amendment__Regulations_2018_Circular_022018.pdfhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/760396/29112018_Circular_Letter.pdf This changed came in the wake of the Grenfell Tower Fire. The part of the amendment relating to elements provided to reduce heat gain was subsequently repealed by the UK High Court in November 2019.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/851544/Circular_letter_- _impact_of_Court_judgment_-_ban_on_combustible_materails_on_external_walls.pdf Approved documents and compliance There are currently sixteen parts (sections) to the building regulations (E & W) and each is lettered as Part A to Part Q (however there is no Part I or N) accompanied by an approved document for that Part X. The approved documents usually take the form of firstly stating the legislation and then providing a number of methods or ways which are deemed to satisfy the regulations. The building regulations do not aim to stifle innovation, and each Approved Document's introduction states this Government Aim. Compliance with the legislation is what is ultimately required and there may be many ways of complying, other than just using the ways set out in the recommended provisions within each of the approved documents. In reality, an innovative solution may be hard to validate, and for most building work the tendency is to take the regulations literally. For example, bathroom manufacturers produce a 'Doc M Pack' for disabled toilets, which reproduces exactly the diagram in Part M,thebluebook.co.uk , Doc M Standard Pack, page from manufacturer's website and most public disabled toilets are now designed around this layout. Many manufactured products have agrément certificates issued by the British Board of Agrément (BBA, a construction products certification service),bbacerts.co.uk, British Board of Agrément certifying compliance with relevant standards. However, the BBA and other bodies (TRADA, BRE, Exova Warrington, etc.) may be able to test and certify to \\"CE\\" harmonised EU standards. \\"CE\\" marking of all construction materials and products is now a legal requirement, since 1 July 2013. Most of the detailed information on the Building Regulations is now available on http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/ where general public users can access simplified building regulations guidance, and professional users have a better organised version of what was on the former DCLG building regulations website, including the full versions of the Approved documents and associated guidance, held on the DCLG website (now a constituent part of the gov.uk website). Part A. Structure This Part requires buildings to be designed, constructed and altered so as to be structurally safe and robust, and also so as not to impair the structural stability of other buildings. It stipulates design standards that should be adopted for use on all buildings and additionally gives simple design rules for most masonry and timber elements for traditional domestic buildings. The weight of the building from the walls, furniture and people in the building will be transmitted to the ground, so as not to cause instability to the building or other buildings. Requires buildings to be built in a way ensuring no collapse will occur disproportionately to its cause. Ground movement such as freezing of subsoil will not impair the stability of the building. The Party Wall, etc. Act 1996 also controls walls and foundations being built near to existing buildings. However, it is \\"civil law\\" and is not enforced by Building Control Bodies. Part B. Fire safety The building regulations consider five aspects of fire safety in the construction of buildings: Requirement B1 - Means of early warning of fire and adequate means of escape from the building (including emergency lighting and fire exit signage). Requirement B2 - Control of Internally fire spread (linings) The wall lining i.e. plaster, plasterboard or wooden boards on the walls and ceiling will resist the spread of flames and give off only reasonable levels of heat, if on fire. Requirement B3 - Control of Internal fire spread (structure) will be maintained during a fire, and fire spread will be prevented. Fire and smoke will be prevented from spreading to concealed spaces in a building's structure by Fire Stopping and Fire Cavity Barriers. Requirement B4 External fire spread – The external walls and roof will resist spread of fire to walls and roofs of other buildings. However, Not all buildings are required to have non-combustible exterior finishes. Requirement B5 The building will be accessible for firefighters and their equipment, without delay. Tall and Large buildings to have Fire Lifts and Fire Mains (Dry or Wet riser pipes), etc. Regulation 7 Gudiance relating to compliance with regulation 7(2) and 7(3) are include with Approved Document B following the 2018 amendments since these regulations are in relation to the specification of the fire performance of external wall construction and specific attachments. Regulation 7(1) continues to be covered by Approved Document 7. = Alternative means to comply = Using BS9999 : 2017 for non- residential buildings Using BS9991 : 2015 for dwellings and other residential buildings The use of a 'Fire Engineer' to computer model the building layout and smoke behavior in such a building. =Building Regulation 38= This requires the designer and/or constructor to give the fire safety information (for a description of the information required – see Appendix G of approved document B) to the Responsible Person, upon completion. This is to enable a competent person to carry out a fire risk assessment. Other fire laws (England & Wales and Scotland) Once a building is occupied the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 (Fire Safety Order 2005 - FSO2005) requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the \\"Responsible Person(s)\\" for the building to provide and maintain \\"suitable and sufficient\\" general fire precautions. Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect. The FSO2005 is criminal law, and breaches of this law can result in the \\"Responsible Person\\" being jailed for up to two years and fined up to £10,000 for each offence. Corporate offences may have unlimited fines. Enforcement is by the local fire authority. It may be necessary to exceed the recommendations of the guidance supporting Part B of Schedule 1 to Building Regulations, in order to achieve a suitable and sufficient level of fire safety required under the FSO2005. Review of fire related building regulations in England, 2017 Hanover House, a residential tower block in Sheffield, with its cladding partially removed after failing fire safety tests following the Grenfell Tower fire. Building regulations are technically under constant review by the DCLG (and are currently being urgently reviewed in light of Grenfell Tower fire). As following this fatal fire in London in June 2017, there is industry wide concern over fire safety issues with many other buildings. Inappropriate combustible material combinations have been found on a broad range of tall local authority, private, NHS, educational and housing association buildings. Combustible materials within the external construction of the outside of tall buildings must comply with the building regulations but this guidance has sometimes been interpreted as applying only to the insulation and not to the cladding.. There are concerns that fire tests may not accurately reflect real life when a building, cladding and insulation are subject to wear and tear.Grenfell Tower: Government to review building regulations BBC The DCLG has set up a weekly email newsletter for those interested in this topic. Part C. Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture Nothing should be growing on the ground covered by the building. Precautions must be taken to stop gases and dangerous substances from previous land use from entering the building and endangering the health and safety of occupants. Subsoil drainage will be in place, if needed, to stop the passage of ground moisture to the interior of the building and to prevent damage to the fabric of the building. The walls, floors and roof of the building shall prevent moisture passing to the inside of the building. The building must have provision to prevent condensation occurring in the roof structure. Complaints arose in the Bristol area after Storm Emma in February 2018 that the attics of more than 50 newly built homes had filled up with snow. Barratt Developments and Redrow plc denied any liability, saying that “Lofts in modern homes are designed to act as home ventilators and to eradicate moisture and condensation issues. The vents are installed in order to comply with building regulations and as such the homes affected by the snow were not defective in any way.” Part D. Toxic substances Some Insulating Materials inserted into (existing) cavity walls can give off toxic fumes. Preventative measures must be taken to stop these fumes reaching occupants of the building. However now largely obsolete as injected materials are now mostly blown chopped fiber and not mixed on-site \\"chemical reaction\\" based methods. See Part C for controls on toxic hazards from ground contaminants and/or brownfield development. Part E. Resistance to the passage of sound Approved Document E 2003 plus amendments 2004 should be read in conjunction with supplemental document 'Robust Details Part E - Resistance to the passage of sound'. Separating floors and walls between domestic dwellings are required to meet a minimum sound insulation performance standard. This applies to both new 'purpose built' and converted 'material change of use' properties. * Purpose built – the sound insulation value for each individual airborne test should be equal to or greater than 45 dB DnTw+Ctr. Each individual impact test should be equal to or less than 62 dB LnTw. * Material change of use – the sound insulation value for each individual airborne test should be equal to or greater than 43 dB DnTw+Ctr. Each individual impact test should be equal to or less than 64 dB LnTw. New internal walls and floors within dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes, whether purpose built or formed by material change of use should achieve a minimum performance of Rw 40 dB when tested in a laboratory. Test data is to be taken from a UKAS accredited laboratory. Pre-completion sound tests have been required since July 2003 to ensure compliance with Approved Document E, unless the Robust Details approach is adopted, see Part L below. Testing is to be undertaken by a UKAS registered test organisation or European equivalent (e.g. ANC). A list of preferred UKAS accredited companies can be found at UKAS Organisation Search. A list of preferred ANC accredited companies can be found at www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk. Care should be taken to ensure site conditions are appropriate before testing commences to ensure tests can be completed and that the best results are achieved. Part F. Ventilation Standards for ventilation and air quality requirements for all buildings are included in this part of the building regulations Due to the increasing complexity of the Regulations, ventilation strategies and system design must be considered at the earliest stages of building design. The Building Regulations consider three ventilation types: * \\"Whole building\\" (formerly referred to as \\"background\\") ventilation to provide fresh air to dilute and disperse low levels of water vapour and other pollutants, usually by the provision of background ventilators or mechanical supply ventilation. * \\"Local extract\\" (formerly referred to as \\"extract\\") ventilation in rooms where most water vapour or concentrated pollutants are released, usually by mechanical means such as extract fans. * \\"Purge\\" (formerly referred to as \\"rapid\\") ventilation for the rapid dilution and removal of high concentrations of pollutants from occasional activities, usually by opening windows. The requirements for purge ventilation are set out in Appendix B of Part F1. The performance rates for each of the \\"system\\" approaches set out in Part F are the minimum requirements needed to ensure that adequate air quality is provided for people indoors. The occupants' health could be at risk if these ventilation rates are compromised. To ensure that these performance rates are met, Part F requires that a flow rate test (also called an airflow test or Part F test) is performed on the installed system and the results submitted to Building Control via a Commissioning Notice. The performance rates do not take account of summer overheating. Most systems may be manually or automatically controlled (with manual override). For each system to be effective, air must be able to flow through the dwelling. The regulations make provision for this via internal door undercuts to maintain a minimum gap of 10mm above the finished floor surface. This provides a 7600mm² permanent opening when a door is closed. There are alternative methods to achieve compliance with Part F. The following explanations are simplified versions of the most common methods of interpreting the \\"Systems\\" approach set out in the provisions section of the Regulation. Background ventilators are now measured in equivalent area (mm² EA) which is a better measure of performance but does not directly relate to the physical size of the opening through the ventilator. * System 1 - Intermittent extract fans and background ventilators * System 2 - Passive stack ventilation and background ventilators * System 3 - Continuous mechanical extract and background ventilators * System 4 - Continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery Part G. Sanitation, hygiene and water efficiency Adequate sanitation facilities i.e. toilet. A house must have either a bath or shower with the ability to heat hot water. Unvented hot water storage systems – restrictions apply to who can install the system. Part H. Drainage and waste disposal An adequate system to carry water used for cooking, washing, toilet, bath or shower to a sewer, cesspool or settlement tank must be in place. A cesspool or settlement tank must be impermeable to liquids and have adequate ventilation. It must also have means of access for emptying, not harm the health of any person and not contaminate water or water supply. An adequate system to carry rainwater away from the roof of a building e.g. guttering carrying water to a sewer. Wheelie bins are used for solid waste collection in the UK. A place to put a wheelie bin or dustbin. The place must not harm anyone's health. Part J. Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems Must have an adequate air supply for combustion and for efficient working of a flue pipe or chimney. Appliances shall discharge the products of combustion to the outside. The appliance, fireplace and chimney shall reduce the risk of the building catching fire. See Part B for general fire safety. Part K. Protection from falling, collision and impact Part K sets minimum standards for the safety of stairways, ramps and ladders, together with requirements for balustrading, windows, and vehicle barriers to prevent falling from floor edges, etc. Glass and glazing safety is also covered. Also included are requirements for guarding where there is a risk of falling, pedestrian and vehicle barriers, and requirements to prevent injury from (opening) doors and windows. Glazing that people come into contact with whilst in a building, should, if broken, break in a way unlikely to cause injury, resist impact without breaking or be shielded or protected from impact. Buildings, other than dwellings that have transparent glazing which people come into contact with while moving around a building, must have features to make it apparent. Windows that can be opened must be operated safely and provision made for safe accessible cleaning. Part K also includes safety requirements relating to the use, operation, and cleaning of windows Part K also includes safety requirements for automatic doors, barriers, shutters and gates. Part L. Conservation of fuel and power Approved documents L1 is specific to dwellings and L2 relates to all buildings other than dwellings. As of 6 April 2006 (2010) (2014) split into four sections: * L1A New dwellings * L1B Existing dwellings * L2A New buildings other than dwellings * L2B Existing buildings other than dwellings Part L controls the insulation values of building elements, the allowable area of windows, doors and other openings, air permeability of the structure, the heating efficiency of boilers and the insulation and controls for heating appliances and systems together with hot water storage and lighting efficiency. It also sets out the requirements for SAP (Standard Assessment Procedure) calculations and carbon emission targets for dwellings. Regulation 16 requires the advertising of the SAP rating in all new dwellings, and in the EPC document. Approved Document L1 is supported by a set of 'robust' construction details, now known as \\"Accredited Construction Details\\".planningportal.gov.uk , Accredited Construction Details which focus on way of limiting air leakage and thermal bridging in construction. By using these tried and tested details, expensive on-site testing can be avoided. In addition to insulation requirements and limitation of openings of the building fabric, this part considers solar heating and heat gains to structures, it controls heating, mechanical ventilation and air conditioning systems, lighting efficiency, space heating controls, air permeability, solar emission, the certification, testing and commissioning of heating and ventilation systems, and requirements for energy meters. Air permeability is measured by air tightness testing for new dwellings (based on a sampling regime), all new buildings other than dwellings and large extensions to buildings other than dwellings. These four Approved Documents must be read in conjunction with the supplemental official and industry documents (the 'second tier' guidance documents). =Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)= All EPCs will be based on SAP 2009 calculations from 1 April 2011. It is highly unlikely that many dwellings built to Part L 2010 will be completed before 1 April 2011. However, in the event that any are, the EPC will need to be produced using SAP 2005. Please note that all plots require a building control approval submission, and EPC regardless of how many identical properties are to be built in the same development. =Part L new requirements= Lighting, ventilation, solar heat gain and possible overheating will all impact on the potential to hit the 25% reduction target but until now have not really troubled the industry. As U-values falls (see table) and airtightness levels increases, heat loss through 'thermal bridges' becomes more significant. The new regulations give these issues more emphasis. They also require designs to avoid unwanted solar gains, leading to excessive summer temperatures. The need now exists to consider these issues at the design stage. See also: * Energy efficiency in British housing * iSBEM * National Home Energy Rating Part M. Access to and use of buildings Part M requires the inclusive provision of ease of access to and circulation within all buildings, together with requirements for facilities for disabled people. Buildings should have reasonable provision: * For all people to gain access and use the building. * Toilets provision shall be made available for all. * If a building has seating such as audience or spectator seating, reasonable provision should be made for people with disabilities. The Equality Act 2010 imposed duties on service providers, schools and public bodies in relation to access for people with disabilities. However, the Part M approved document is not written as a means of ensuring compliance with these legal duties. It is written to ensure that the design of a building does not create physical barriers to a building's inclusive use, over its lifetime. Part M of the Building Regulations relates to the 'Access to and Use of Buildings' and draws largely on the legislation covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Disability Discrimination (Employment) Regulations 1996. This document is particularly relevant to new build where such properties must comply. If in any doubt as to whether your alterations are affected by this document, the local building control department will be able to assist further. Later alterations of a building must not remove or reduce its accessibility features.  Part N. Glazing – safety in relation to impact, opening and cleaning  Part N was Repealed in 2013 and these measures were moved into a new consolidated Part K in 2013 (See above). Part P. Electrical safety – dwellings New rules for electrical safety in the home, the garden and its outbuildings. This part only applies to dwellings (in some cases, buildings that would be exempt but which take their electrical supply from a dwelling). Several government approved competent persons schemes support Part P. Reasonable provision shall be made in the design, installation, inspection and testing of electrical installations in order to protect persons from fire or injury. Sufficient information shall be provided so that persons wishing to operate, maintain or alter an electrical installation can do so with reasonable safety. Certain types of work require notification to the local authority for building control. In England this is only work within 'Zone 1' of a bathroom, and new consumer units and complete new circuits. In Wales there are more 'notifiable works' including wiring in kitchens and gardens. Installers who are members of an approved \\"Competent Persons Scheme\\" may carry out such electrical work without the need to submit many such formal building regulations applications, instead notification is performed via their trade body. Part Q. Security In 2015 a new requirement, Part Q, came into force. Part Q talks about security in a dwelling with reasonable provisions needing to have been made to resist unauthorised access to any dwelling or any part of a building from which access can be gained to a flat within the building. Part R. Physical infrastructure for high speed electronic communications networks Part R was introduced in 2016 and takes effect at the beginning of 2017. It requires \\"network termination points\\" in buildings to provide access to high-speed Internet via fibre or copper. Exempt buildings Exempt buildings include: * CLASS I Buildings controlled under other legislation e.g. Any building in which explosives are manufactured or stored under a licence granted under the Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005 or nuclear-related buildings or an ancient monument. * CLASS II Buildings not frequented by people (unless close to an existing building). * CLASS III Greenhouses and agricultural buildings (not used for retail). * CLASS IV Temporary buildings (erected for less than 28 days). * CLASS V Ancillary buildings. * CLASS VI Small detached buildings (garages, garden storage sheds/huts) (less than 30 square metres floor area with no sleeping accommodation therein). * CLASS VII Extensions – porches, covered ways, conservatories, (less than 30 square metres floor area). The Building Regulations 2000 have been amended five times since the original statutory instrument was published. A new consolidated edition was published in 2010 – the Building Regulations 2010. These have also now been amended five times since 2010. It is good practice to have exemption confirmed by the relevant local authority prior to starting construction works or alterations. The latest statutory instrument gives the full conditions of exemptions (and any newly controlled buildings). Crown buildings (national government buildings) are no longer totally exempt the Building Regulations. All Crown buildings must comply with the energy efficiency measures set out in Part L. This is due to EU laws requiring higher energy efficiency in all buildings (new and existing) under European \\"climate change\\" measures such as the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. EU law requires public buildings to be \\"good energy practice\\" examples. New energy regulations have been made to fully implement these EU laws, where they fall outside the scope of the building regulations.

Description The present station is located on a sharp curve on the southern approach to the Boyne Viaduct. Formerly there were three lines through the station between the 'up' and 'down' platforms, but when the station was refurbished in 1997, the up platform line was removed and the platform widened. It was given the name MacBride on Sunday 10 April 1966 in commemoration of John MacBride, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916. History The original Drogheda station opened on 25 May 1844 about a quarter mile southeast. The passenger station was resited when the first temporary Boyne Viaduct opened on 11 May 1853. The former GNR(I) branch to Oldcastle (opened to Navan in 1850; throughout 1863) diverges from the Dublin-Belfast mainline immediately south of the station. This serves Irish Cement at Drogheda and Tara Mine near Navan. DART Expansion As part of Project Ireland 2040 the DART will be extended to Drogheda. No works on this project have yet been announced.

He was the founder of Safeguard Scientifics, a venture capital firm that invested in technology companies. At the peak of the dot-com bubble, Musser was a billionaire on paper; however, when the bubble burst, he lost almost his entire fortune. Musser was a philanthropist and The Musser Foundation has donated over $50 million to organizations including the Boy Scouts of America. Musser has served on the board of directors of the Cradle of Liberty Council. The Musser Award for Excellence in Leadership from Fox School of Business and Management at Temple University and the Musser Scout Reservation in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, are named after Musser. Early life and education Musser was born in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, area on December 15, 1926 and earned a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering at Lehigh University in 1949. Career In 1952, at the age of 25, Musser went to work as a stockbroker trainee for Hornblower & Weeks. The next year, he left the company with others to form their own company. In 1955, his company acquired Safe-Guard Corporation and in 1966, Musser's firm changed its name to Safeguard Industries. Musser invested in technology companies in Philicon Valley such as QVC, Comcast, and Novell, which resulted in a $200 million profit. In March 1996, when Ken Fox and Walter Buckley left Safeguard Scientifics to form Internet Capital Group (later Actua Corporation), they asked Musser for $5 million in funding, but he insisted on investing $15 million. At the height of the dot-com bubble, the company had a market capitalization of almost $60 billion, making Musser a paper billionaire. Musser was a director of TyCom, a subsidiary of Tyco International, and in December 2000, he borrowed $14.1 million from Tyco executives Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz On November 29, 2000, after the burst of the dot-com bubble, to repay a loan, Musser was forced to sell 6.5 million of his shares in Safeguard Scientifics for $8.25 per share, or $53.7 million. The stock price was down over 90% from the peak of $99 per share 9 months earlier. This left him with 560,000 shares in the company. In 2003, Musser defaulted on a $26.5 million loan from Safeguard Scientifics. Musser was a member of the board of directors of Brandywine Realty Trust from 1996, when the company acquired properties from a joint venture of Safeguard Scientifics, until 2002. Personal life Musser married and divorced Betty K. Musser (née Umstad) and then Hilary Grinker Musser, who was 39 years younger than him. Musser's son, Craig, a renowned kaleidoscope artist under the name Van Dyke, was partnered with Bruce Darda, a New York based tech executive, at the time of his death from AIDS in 1986. Musser spent lavishly on his residences, building his-and- hers tennis courts on his Nantucket residence and spending $100,000 on special garage doors. Musser also was a contributor to Republican causes. He died on November 25, 2019.

Designed early in the career of noted Salem builder Samuel McIntire (1757–1811), and modified later by him, the building gives a unique view into the methods and styles of McIntire. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 for its significance as an early masterwork of one the country's first recognized master builders. It is now owned by the Peabody Essex Museum. History Jerathmiel Peirce (1747–1827), began his career as a leather dresser. In about 1778, he formed a partnership with Aaron Waite, and purchased a two-gun schooner, the Greyhound, to serve as a privateer against British merchant vessels in the Revolutionary War. The partnership prospered, and over the next half a century, purchased/built at least 10 vessels, sending them to ports around the world. In 2000, the National Park Service had a full-scale replica of one of the Waite & Peirce ships built, the Friendship of Salem, which is the centerpiece of Salem Maritime National Historic Site. Waite and Peirce were also major investors in the newly incorporated Beverly Bank, and were members of Salem's merchant aristocracy. Salem was a major center of trade in the early 1800s, and as a result of this, was the home of America's first millionaire, and on a per- capita basis, was the richest city in America. Peirce went from humble beginnings to owning one of the finest homes in Salem.Ward, Gerald W. R. The Peirce-Nichols House, pp. 6-8, Essex Institute, Salem, Massachusetts, 1976.Frayler, John. Friendship: The World of a Salem East Indiaman, 1797–1813, pp.7-8, Eastern National, 1998.Hurd, Duane Hamilton. History of Essex County, Massachusetts, pp. 69, 72, vol. 1, J. W. Lewis & Co., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1888. Interior of the Peirce–Nichols House. McIntire did many of the fine woodworking details himself. In 1779, Peirce purchased a large lot in Salem, and in about 1782, he engaged Samuel McIntire to design and build his home there.Nichols, George. Nichols, Martha, ed. Salem Shipmaster and Merchant: The Autobiography of George Nichols, pp. 12, 99, 104, The Four Seas Company, Boston, Massachusetts, 1921. The property he owned went all the way to the banks of the North River, where his ships tied up and he had a counting house.Nichols, George. Nichols, Martha, ed. Salem Shipmaster and Merchant: The Autobiography of George Nichols, pp. 62-3, 103, 115, The Four Seas Company, Boston, Massachusetts, 1921. The house is known to have been completed by 1784, when city tax records show Peirce being assessed for a completed house. Peirce later suffered financial misfortune and was forced to sell the house. It was purchased by friends, who willed it to the children of George and Sally (Peirce) Nichols. The house remained in the Nichols family until 1917, when it was sold to the Essex Institute, predecessor to the Peabody Essex Museum. It was opened to the public in the late 1930s after the last of the Nichols owners died. The Friendship of Salem McIntire patterned the design of the house fairly closely on patterns found in the Builder's Treasury of Batty Langley, published in 1740. As a result, the house has late Georgian styling. This was altered in some portions in 1801, when Peirce again hired McIntire to redo the hallway east parlor in preparation for the wedding of his daughter Sally to George Nichols. This area features the lighter Federal styling that was being popularized by architect Charles Bulfinch. View from the side (HABS photo, 1940) The house property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968, cited as a particularly elegant example of late Georgian craftsmanship, and for its association with McIntire. It is also a contributing element of Salem's Chestnut Street District. The Peabody Essex Museum offers tours of the house. Description The Peirce–Nichols House is a three-story wood-frame building sheathed in clapboards. It has a low pitch hipped roof that is encircled by a low balustrade at the cornice, which further has a central flat section that functions as a roof deck and is also surrounded by a balustrade. The corners of the building are decorated by fluted Doric pilasters rising the height of the building. The front entry is in the center bay (of five), and is sheltered by a pedimented porch supported by Doric columns set on a brownstone step. Large twin chimneys rise through the interior of the house. The windows on the first two floors feature 6 over 6 sashes, while the third floor has typical foreshortened 3 over 6 sashes. Behind the house is a carriage house which is thought to date from the same time as the house.

The CITUB is Bulgaria's largest, most influential and well-established trade union, having several times more members than its largest rival - KT Podkrepa. CITUB's headquarters, the former socialist-era Trade Unions Building The KNSB is affiliated with the International Trade Union Confederation and the European Trade Union Confederation. In addition to its unionist activities, the CITUB also has a research department dubbed the Institute for Social and Syndicalist Studies, which analyzes social and economic issues, conducts polls and publishes informational bulletins.  History = Foundation and Heritage  The CITUB considers itself to be the \\"inheritor of a 140-year history of the labour movement\\" in the country. In its modern form, CITUB was formed as a result of a reorganization of the Socialist era Central Council of Trade Unions (CCTU) during an extraordinary congress in February 1990. The CCTU itself was founded in 1945 as a replacement for the Tsarist era Bulgarian Workers Union, which existed between 1935 and 1944 and was formed by the royalist government after it had banned all other trade unions in the country.  Trade Union Rivalry  The CITUB has historically been a rival of KT Podkrepa since both unions' inceptions, as the CITUB emerged from the pro- communist labour union centre in 1990, while its rival Podkrepa emerged from dissident groups closer to the SDS and DPS, immediately drawing the two groups into opposing camps. Though CITUB was immediately more influential, its membership dwarfing that of Podkrepa at a ratio of nearly 10:1, Podkrepa would go on to become a constituent member of the SDS once it became a legal organization. The CITUB on the other hand would remain staffed with many socialists and communists among its ranks. Because of this, CITUB would then be criticised from the right for being too closely linked to the Bulgarian Socialist Party (the political heir to the Bulgarian Communist Party), while at the same time criticised from the left for being too aggressively reformist. It initially refused to take part in strikes against the government of Andrey Lukanov, a former communist turned social democrat, though it would eventually criticise Lukanov's government for its inaction toward labour rights and join the strikes against his government shortly thereafter, contributing to the fall of Lukanov's government. Conversely, Podkrepa would come under criticism for its right-wing policies and membership in the SDS, leading Podkrepa's leader to downgrade his union's status in the SDS from that of full member to that of an observer. Despite their rivalry, the two unions later grew to work together and eventually both came to support the Socialist Party's government between 2005 and 2009, though relations had began to deteriorate toward the end of the mandate and both unions have since become critical of all political parties. Though the two unions have since cooperated on several issues, Podkrepa has refused to support the CITUB's calls for higher wages and the two unions have refused to hold International Workers' Day celebrations together.

The hypertonia may be predominantly truncal, attenuated during sleep and less prominent after a year of age. Classic hyperekplexia is caused by genetic mutations in a number of different genes, all of which play an important role in glycine neurotransmission. Glycine is used by the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Hyperekplexia is generally classified as a genetic disease, but some disorders can mimic the exaggerated startle of hyperekplexia. Signs and symptoms The three main signs of hyperekplexia are generalized stiffness, excessive startle beginning at birth and nocturnal myoclonus. Affected individuals are fully conscious during episodes of stiffness, which consist of forced closure of the eyes and an extension of the extremities followed by a period of generalised stiffness and uncontrolled falling at times. Initially, the disease was classified into a \\"major\\" and a \\"minor\\" form, with the minor form being characterized by an excessive startle reflex, but lacking stiffness. There is only genetic evidence for the existence of the major form. Other signs and symptoms of hyperekplexia may include episodic neonatal apnea, excessive movement during sleep and the head- retraction reflex. The link to some cases of Sudden Infant Death remains controversial. Genetics Hyperekplexia is known to be caused by a variety of genes, encoding both pre- and postsynaptic proteins. The symptoms displayed, as well as the forms of heritance, vary based on which gene is affected. GLRA1 The first gene linked conclusively to hyperekplexia was GLRA1. The GLRA1 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha-1 subunit, which, together with the glycine receptor beta subunit, forms synaptic glycine receptors. Inhibitory glycine receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels that facilitate fast responses in the brainstem and spinal-cord. Homomeric glycine receptors composed exclusively of alpha-1 subunits exhibit normal ion channel electrophysiology but are not sequestered at the synaptic junction. Native glycine receptors are thus supposed to be heteromers of the alpha-1 and beta subunits, in either a 3:2 or 2:3 ratio. Within these heteromers, it is believed that the alpha-1 subunits bind glycine and undergo a conformational change, inducing a conformational change in the pentamer, causing the ion- channel to open. Although autosomal dominant inheritance was initially reported, there are at least as many cases described with autosomal recessive inheritance. Thus far, the general rule is that mutations causing structurally normal proteins that cannot bind glycine or cannot properly undergo a required conformational change will result in a dominant form of the disease, while mutations that result in truncated or wildly malformed subunits that cannot be integrated into a receptor protein will result in a recessive form. GLRB The GLRB gene encodes the beta subunit of the glycine receptor. Homomeric glycine receptors composed of beta subunits do not open in response to glycine stimulation, however, the beta subunit is essential for proper receptor localization through its interactions with gephyrin, which results in receptor clustering at the synaptic cleft. As such, the defects within the GLRB gene show autosomal recessive inheritance. SLC6A5 The SLC6A5 gene encodes the GlyT2 transporter, a neuronal pre-synaptic glycine re-uptake transporter. In comparison to the GlyT1 transporter, found mostly in glial cells, GlyT2 helps maintain a high concentration of glycine within the axon terminal of glycinergic neurons. Mutations of the SLC6A5 gene have been associated with hyperekplexia in an autosomal recessive manner. Defects within this gene are hypothesized either to affect the incorporation of the transporter into the cellular membrane or to its affinity for the molecules it transports: sodium ions, chloride ions and glycine. Any of these actions would drastically reduce the pre-synaptic cell's ability to produce the high vesicular concentrations of glycine necessary for proper glycine neurotransmission.GPHN and ARHGEF9 are often included in lists of genetic causes of hyperekplexia - but in fact they produce a much more complex phenotype, very distinct from classical hyperekplexia. As such they are no longer considered to be causative genes. GPHN Gephyrin, an integral membrane protein believed to coordinate glycine receptors, is coded by the gene GPHN. A heterozygous mutation in this gene has been identified in a sporadic case of hyperekplexia, though experimental data is inconclusive as to whether the mutation is pathogenic. Gephyrin is essential for glycine receptor clustering at synaptic junctions through its action of binding both the glycine receptor beta subunit and internal cellular microtubule structures. Gephyrin also assists in clustering GABA receptors at synpases and molybdenum cofactor synthesis. Because of its multi-functional nature, it is not presumed to be a common genetic source of hyperekplexia. ARHGEF9 A defect within the gene coding for collybistin (ARHGEF9) has been shown to cause hyperekplexia in concert with epilepsy. Since the ARHGEF9 gene is on the X chromosome, this gene displays X-linked recessive heritance. The collybistin protein is responsible for proper gephyrin targeting, which is crucial for the proper localization of glycine and GABA receptors. Deficiencies in collybistin function would result in an artificial lack of glycine and GABA receptors at the synaptic cleft. Diagnosis There are three conditions used to diagnose if an infant has hereditary hyperekplexia: if the child's body is stiff all over as soon as they are born, if they overreact to noises and other stimuli, and if the reaction to stimuli is followed by an overall stiffness where the child is unable to make any voluntary movements. A combination of electroencephalogram and an electromyogram may help diagnose this condition in patients who have not displayed symptoms as children. the electroencephalogram will not show abnormal activity other than a spike in wakefulness or alertness, while the electromyogram will show rapid muscular responses and hyperreflexia. Otherwise, genetic testing is the only definitive diagnosis. MRIs and CT scans will be normal unless other conditions exist. Treatment The most commonly effective treatment is clonazepam, which leads to the increased efficacy of another inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. There are anecdotal reports of the use of levetiracetam in genetic and acquired hyperekplexia. During attacks of hypertonia and apnea, the limbs and head may be flexed towards the trunk in order to dissipate the symptoms. This is named the Vigevano maneuver after the doctor who invented it. History The disorder was first described in 1958 by Kirstein and Silfverskiold, who reported a family with 'drop seizures'. In 1962 Drs. Kok and Bruyn reported an unidentified hereditary syndrome, initially started as hypertonia in infants. Genetic analysis within this large Dutch pedigree was later found to carry a mutation within the GLRA1 gene, which was the first gene implicated in hyperekplexia.

Enraged, he left the house and went to the police station, where he reported for duty at 4:00 p.m. According to early reports, he began drinking heavily, though eyewitnesses later stated that Woo did not appear drunk during his rampage, and according to local officials, he would have been unable to cover of difficult, rocky terrain while intoxicated. At about 7:30 p.m., Woo returned home, punched and kicked his girlfriend and smashed the furniture, before making his way to the reservists' armory and gathering several weapons, consisting of two M2 carbines, 144-180 rounds of ammunition, and seven hand grenades. Some reports stated that the other officers were at a meeting, and he therefore managed to grab the weapons unnoticed,Berserk South Korea cop slay total of 56 people, Lodi News-Sentinel (April 28, 1982) though others mentioned that he had intimidated the guards to gain access.

He next went to Torongni, where he threw a grenade and shot at passers-by in the marketplace, killing six people. He also wounded Chun Mal-soon, who had gone to investigate after hearing shots in the village. From that point on, he proceeded from village to village, taking advantage of his position as a police officer to gain entry to the houses and shoot their inhabitants. At 10:30 p.m., Woo took 18-year-old Kim Ju-dong (김주동) hostage and moved to Ungye-Ri (운계리), where he ordered the boy to get him a soft drink from a grocery store owned by 52-year-old Shin We-do (신외도). After getting what he had asked for, Woo killed the boy and then attacked the store owner and his family. Shin We-do managed to escape after being shot in the leg, though his wife Son Won-jeom (손원점) and his daughters Chang-sun (창순) and Su-jeong (수정) were killed.Korean policeman's rampage leaves 58 dead, The Daily Union (April 27, 1982) Woo continued his shooting at the market-place, killing a total of 18 people in that village, before making his way towards Pyongchon- Ni (평촌리). At Pyongchon-Ni, he shot a family of four in their beds and then went to a house, where a wake was in progress. When the owner of the house saw the armed policeman and asked what had happened, Woo explained that there was an alert as North Korean agents had been spotted. The man invited Woo into the house for dinner, during which the latter complained about his small salary and his transfer from Pusan to the countryside. Woo eventually began shooting at the guests after one of them had remarked that his ammunition did not look real. He killed twelve people in the house and a further eight in the streets, thus leaving a total of 24 people dead in Pyongchon-ni.  Police response, suspect's death  Although police were alerted within minutes of the first shots being fired, it took them an hour to gather a team of 37 officers to search for the gunman, and the national police headquarters in Seoul were not informed until 1:40 a.m.Minister sacked over massacre, New Straits Times (April 29, 1982) Around that time, just 4 km (2.5 mi) from the police station in Kungryu, Woo found refuge in a farmhouse belonging to 68-year-old Suh In-Su (서인수), whom he told that he was chasing a Communist infiltrator, and that the family should gather in the main room of the house so he could protect them. When the family gathered at his request, he held them hostage. Two hours later, police eventually caught up with him, and as forces closed in, Woo detonated two grenades, killing himself and three of his hostages. Suh himself survived gravely injured.Ricochet from a rampage, Far Eastern Economic Review (May 7, 1982) Four rounds of ammunition and one hand grenade were recovered by police from inside the farmhouse.  Immediate aftermath  When the rampage finally ended, 55 people and Woo himself were dead, while 36 others were wounded, six of them seriously. One of the injured, a child who had been shot, died on May 8, bringing the number of people killed by the gunman to 56. At that time, 35 people were still being treated in hospitals in Jinju and Masan.Murder toll rises to 56, The Straits Times (May 10, 1982) Chun Mal-soon later said that her boyfriend \\"suffered from an inferiority complex and had been bothered by villagers' comments on their living together unmarried\\". Later on, the provincial chief of police was suspended and four other officers were arrested for negligence of duty.Seoul is stunned by policeman's slaying of 56, The New York Times (April 28, 1982)  Aftermath  The Interior Minister of South Korea, Suh Chung-hwa, and the national police chief, A Eung- mo, offered to resign as a form of atonement for Woo's rampage. Suh Chung-hwa, being held responsible for the incident by president Chun Doo-hwan, laid his office down on April 29, and Roh Tae-woo was appointed Interior Minister. A special parliamentary team was formed, consisting of 19 parliamentarians and led by Home Affairs Committee chairman Kim Chong-hoh, to investigate the shooting and its disastrous handling by the police. Furthermore, the South Korean Cabinet decided to pay compensations to the victims and their families.Victims of amok slayings to get compensation, New Straits Times (April 30, 1982) (p.8)  See also  *List of rampage killers  References Further reading * \\"Korean policeman goes berserk, kills 58 people\\", The Deseret News (April 27, 1982), p. 1 * \\"Korean cop's rampage leaves 58 dead\\", Ocala Star-Banner (April 27, 1982) * \\"Korean policeman's rampage kills 58\\", Boca Raton News (April 27, 1982) * \\"Berserk Korean policeman kills 62\\", Gainesville Sun (April 27, 1982) * \\"Drunken South Korean policeman kills 62\\", The Ledger (April 27, 1982) * \\"Berserk cop kills 53\\", Ellensburg Daily Record (April 27, 1982) * \\"Korean cop massacres 58\\", Eugene Register-Guard (April 27, 1982) * \\"Funerals begin for 57 victims of massacre by Korean cop\\", Ocala Star- Banner (April 28, 1982) * \\"Korean massacre area flooded with donations\\", Eugene Register-Guard (April 28, 1982) * \\"Korean's shooting rampage triggered by swat of a fly\\", St. Petersburg Times (April 28, 1982), Florida * \\"Death toll in rampage put at 62\\", The Age (April 28, 1982) * \\"Drunken Korean kills 58\\", The Free-Lance Star (April 27, 1982) * \\"28명 죽이고 초상집 문상… 부의금 3000원 낸 뒤 또 난사\\", The Hankyoreh (April 13, 2012)  External links  * Category:1955 births Category:1982 deaths Category:South Korean mass murderers Category:South Korean spree killers Category:South Korean murderers of children Category:Male suicide bombers Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Law enforcers who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:Murder–suicides in South Korea Category:Mass murder in 1982 Category:South Korean police officers Category:Republic of Korea Marine Corps personnel Category:People from South Gyeongsang Province Category:Suicides by explosive device in South Korea Category:Spree shootings in South Korea Category:Mass shootings in South Korea Category:Mass murder in South Korea ","title":"Woo Bum-kon"},{"id":"4467908","text":"Charles Martin (born 1942, New York City) is a poet, critic and translator.

A graduate of the University of Queensland, Henderson was Resident Composer at Opera Australia during their first season at the Sydney Opera House in 1973.Australian Music Centre In the mid-1970s, Henderson studied composition with Karlheinz Stockhausen and music-theatre with Mauricio Kagel at the Cologne Musikhochschule. Henderson's compositions include such pieces as the work for organ and pre-recorded tape, Sacred Site (1983), The Dreaming written for the Australian Chamber Orchestra, \\"Six Urban Songs: The Patrick White Song Cycle\\" for soprano and orchestra (1983), and an opera, Lindy (1997), with Judith Rodriguez (as co-librettist), based on the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain at Uluru in 1980. The mother, Lindy Chamberlain, was tried for the murder of the child. The opera documents the travesty of justice as it was meted out to Lindy Chamberlain and her then husband, Michael. It premiered at the Sydney Opera House in 2002.  Early career  In 1973, after being appointed resident composer to the Australia Opera during inaugural season at the Sydney Opera House, Henderson was awarded a DAAD Scholarship and a travel grant to the Music Board from the Music Board of Australia Council for the Arts. There, she continued her musical education in Germany then returned to Australia towards the end of 1976 to teach composition as a part-time lecturer at the University of Sydney. In 1978, she became resident composer in the Department of Music, and in a three-year span, she worked to stimulate the interest of students in music-theatre by encouraging them to create their own music-theatre compositions.  Works  Henderson did not focus on one style of composition. Her works ranged from chamber music, instrumental music, vocal music, choral music, electronic music, and vocal ensemble music, sometimes covered in different musical versions. Some of her most recognized works are 'Sorry time: cello solo' (1999), 'The Beloved awaits: brass quintet (2008), 'Ku-ring-gai Chase: full orchestra' (1999), 'G'day USA 1: horn solo' (2003), and 'Yapu vudlandta: fate, clarinet, and piano' (2004).  Inventions In the mid-seventies while in Germany, she received a commission from sculptor Helfried Hagenberg to compose music on a sculpture he had created from twenty-seven triangles. During the course of her commission, she developed the alemba, a keyboard percussion instrument. She is also the inventor of the Tosca Bells, a percussion instrument with hollow metal tubes that create a vibrating bell-like sound when hit. She also developed the 'noose' for stringed instruments that enables the composer to write 'natural' harmonics on virtually every note within the range of the string orchestra.  Awards  Throughout her career, Henderson has been nominated in both musical and theatrical industries. In 1974, Henderson won the Kranichsteiner Prize for best composition in a music theatre piece. For developing the alemba instrument, she was awarded the one of the inaugural CSIRO Artist-in Residence Fellowships in November 1983. In 1993, Henderson was nominated for Don Banks Music award, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the 1996 Australia Day Honours for her service as a composer.

The basic set-up is that Rin, Nerine, Itsuki, and Mayumi find a strange watch that transports them back in time, where they met Forbesii before he is married and has Nerine. While he is engaged to Ai, his maid, Sage, is also in love with him, causing a love triangle. The players actions determine who Forbesii ultimately ends up with, and thus who is the mother of Nerine. Nerine Watch system Just like in Shuffle!, the player will encounter events that will ask them to choose some option. Choosing one of them may cause an event to happen, while choosing the other may not have any effect on the game. This feature returns in Tick! Tack!. However, the company has included a new feature by displaying an antique watch on the top left-hand side of the screen. This watch is a gauge that shows the player Nerine's changes as a result of the player's meddling with the past. When the player chooses an option, the watch will either tick counter-clockwise (the green side, by making random contacts with all the characters), clockwise (the red side, usually by making contact with Sage and diverting her interest away from Forbesii), or may not tick at all. When the green or red gauge reaches a certain level (around either 3 or 9 o'clock), Nerine will change her form to either the red-haired form or the \\"lolita\\" form. There are also reports that if the player plays Nerine's route correctly, both green and red will be full and synchronized, this phenomenon will temporarily change Nerine to her clone, Lycoris.

He ranks among the best goalscorers in the history of both the Poland national team and Polish club football. After re-taking German citizenship following the invasion of Poland, he also played for the Germany national team. Willimowski was the first player to score four goals in a single FIFA World Cup game. Over the course of his career, he scored a total of 1,175 goals;as quoted by kicker sportmagazin, #100, 15 Dec 1969, p. 2 though this tally is unverified and will include friendly and unofficial matches. The RSSSF credits Wilimowski with 554 official goals, making him the 14th-most prolific goalscorer in history.Best Goalscorers All-Time (Official Matches) rsssf.com Willimowski also occasionally played ice hockey for the team Pogoń Katowice. Early life Born in Kattowitz (Katowice), Prussian Silesia, German Empire, Willimowski was raised in a Silesian family, typical of the Upper Silesian Polish-German borderland. After eastern Upper Silesia became part of Poland in 1922, he became a citizen of the Second Polish Republic. His parents, Ernst-Roman and Paulina, were German. His father, a soldier for the German Empire, died on the Western Front in the First World War. His mother sent him to a German kindergarten, a German primary schoolThomas Urban: Schwarze Adler, weiße Adler. Deutsche und polnische Fußballer im Räderwerk der Politik. Göttingen 2011, p. 30. and, when he was nine years old, to the German football team 1. FC Kattowitz. At the age of 13, he was legally adopted by his stepfather, who was Polish,Urban, op.cit., p. 31. and took on the surname Willimowski. At home, he spoke German for the most part, while in public he often spoke a Silesian dialect of the Polish language. Officially a citizen of Poland, he referred to himself as a Silesian (\\"Górnoślązak\\" - Oberschlesier). Early career=Ruch Chorzów Willimowski, who had six toes on his right foot, played on the left side as a forward and showed himself to be a very skilled dribbler as well as a natural goalscorer. He began his career with the ethnically German club 1. FC Kattowitz, then in 1933 at the age of 17, moved to Polish side Ruch Wielkie Hajduki, today known as Ruch Chorzów. \\"Ezi\\" quickly established himself as the team's best player: in his first season he scored 33 goals to lead the league. His first Ekstraklasa game took place on 8 April 1934, a few weeks later, he capped for Polish national team. With a number of excellent footballers besides Willimowski (for example Teodor Peterek and Gerard Wodarz), Ruch dominated the Polish soccer and was the league champion in 1933–1936 and 1938. Willimowski played 86 games for Ruch, scoring 112 goals, and was the league's top scorer in 1934 and 1936. He also led the league in scoring in 1939 until the German invasion of Poland. On 21 May 1939, he scored 10 goals in a single match against Union Touring Łódź as his club won 12-1. That performance still stands as a league record. Polish national team Soon after beginning his club football career, \\"Ezi\\" earned his first cap for Poland when he debuted against Denmark in København on 21 May 1934 in a 2:4 loss: he was just 17 years and 332 days old. In a total of 22 appearances for Poland Willimowski netted 21 goals, nearly a goal per game. However, his off field conduct was less than ideal and in 1936 the young man's penchant for drinking and partying led to a one-year suspension imposed by the Polish football association just before the Olympic Games in Berlin. Without his goal scoring touch the Poles managed only a fourth-place finish in the Olympic tournament. Many felt that his presence could have brought the team a gold medal. Willimowski's appearances for Poland include two performances that were both historic and memorable. In a match against Brazil played in Strasbourg, France during the 1938 FIFA World Cup, \\"Ezi\\" put on a stunning display by becoming the first player ever to score four goals in a single World Cup match. His continued attacks on the opposition net also drew a penalty as he was fouled to the ground by Brazilian keeper Batatais, which led to Poland's fifth goal scored from the spot by German-born Fritz Scherfke, from Poznań. However, it was not enough - Poland lost the match 5-6 and was eliminated from the tournament. Willimowski's record was later equalled by other players, but was bettered only 56 years later, when Oleg Salenko scored five goals against Cameroon during the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It still remains the only World Cup match when a player from the losing side scored four goals. Willimowski put on another memorable display on 27 August 1939 in Warsaw in an international friendly against what was then one of the best teams in the world - Hungary, the 1938 World Cup runner-up. After 33 minutes of play the Hungarians were ahead 2:0. Willimowski scored three goals and again drew a penalty through his attacking play which was converted by teammate Leonard Piątek, giving Poland a 4:2 win. The match was the last game played before the start of World War II just four days later. War years After the division of Poland, Willimowski as Volksdeutscher re-took German citizenship, like the majority of the inhabitants of the Eastern part of Upper Silesia, among them all the players of the Polish national team coming from this region. It allowed them to continue their football careers as Poles were not permitted to participate in sports under the Nazi occupation. In the early days of the war Willimowski had to hide from the Nazis because of the enmity of a local Kreisleiter (county leader) of the NSDAP named Georg Joschke who held against Willimowski the 1933 transfer from the ethnically-German club 1. FC Kattowitz to the Polish Ruch Chorzów. Allegedly, Joschke threatened that Willimowski would have to wear the letter \\"P\\" (for Pole) on his clothes. This never happened, as Willimowski was too good a player and well appreciated by other German football officials. However, his mother Paulina, was placed in Auschwitz Concentration Camp, which she survived. Wilimowski's mother was incarcerated because she got engaged in an intimate relationship with a Russian Jew, which was regarded as Rassenschande in Nazi Germany. Ernst, who in later stages of the war became friends with legendary pilot Hermann Graf, managed to save her, with Graf's help. For propaganda purposes Nazi sports officials made 1. FC Kattowitz a model side representative of the German Upper Silesia. The region's best players were assigned to the team and besides Willimowski included Erwin Nyc, Ewald Dytko and Paweł Cyganek. \\"Ezi\\" played there until February 1940, before moving on to Chemnitz, where he took up a job as a policeman while playing for the local team Polizei-Sportverein Chemnitz (1940–1942). Through the course of the war he also played for TSV 1860 München (1942–1944), where he was a member of the Tschammerpokal (German Cup) winning side of 1942. In the final game of the 1942 German Cup, at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin, the Munich side won 2-0, with the first goal scored by Wilimowski. In final years of the war, Wilimowski became soldier of the Wehrmacht, but he was allowed to play in army football teams, f.e. LSV Mölders in German occupied Kraków.Urban, op.cit., p. 43. German national team Like other officials, Sepp Herberger, manager of the German national team, developed an immediate appreciation for Wilimowski's talent. He debuted for Germany against Romania on 1 June 1941, in Bucharest scoring twice in a 4-1 victory. He followed that performance with three goals against Finland in Helsinki on 5 October 1941 as the Germans scored an easy 6-0 win. The only international match Wilimowski ever played in his native Upper Silesia (in Beuthen, now Bytom, Poland), whether wearing a Polish or German jersey, was on 16 August 1942 versus the Romanian side. He contributed one goal in a 7–0 win (another German star, Fritz Walter, netted three goals in the contest). The match was the biggest sporting event staged there during the war as 55,000 fans came to cheer on their native son. Willimowski's most memorable performance for the German national side came on 18 October 1942 in Bern, Switzerland as the Germans defeated a well-respected Swiss national team by a score of 5-3. \\"Ezi\\" scored four of five goals with the other being netted by Fritz Walter. Wilimowski was capped a total of eight times for Germany, scoring 13 goals (1.63 per match). His last appearance for Germany was in a 5-2 victory over Slovakia in Bratislava on 22 November 1942. After this match Germany no longer played international friendlies because of the war. Postwar career After the war, Willimowski, who was regarded by the Polish government as a traitor, was not allowed to visit his Silesian homeland during the Communist regime. He was with SG Chemnitz-West in 1946-47 and had a short spell with RC Strasbourg in 1949.Sport-Magazin No. 31 of 1949, p. 4 After that, he settled in the Karlsruhe area, opening a restaurant there. Even though he was already in his 30s when organized playing resumed, he continued a career that lasted until 1959 and age 43. During this period he played for, or had talks with, several German club teams including TSV Detmold (in between seasons, no league appearances), FV Offenburg (as a player-coach), BC Augsburg for a short spell in the autumn of 1948, Singen 04, where he had a good comeback scoring 16 Oberliga goals in 1950-51, and VfR Kaiserslautern (including 70 goals in 89 Oberliga Südwest appearances for the latter, all scored when he was over 35 years old). After retiring, together with wife, Wilimowski for a while ran a restaurant, then worked in a Pfaff sewing machine factory, to retire in 1978. At the 1974 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Willimowski allegedly wanted to pay a visit to the Polish national team that stayed in Murrhardt near Stuttgart, but was refused permission by PZPN officials. In 1995, he was invited by Ruch Chorzów to come to Upper Silesia and celebrate club's 75th anniversary. Willimowski, according to his oldest daughter, Sylvia Haarke, wanted to come to Poland, saying that had it not been for the war, he would never have left Katowice. However, his wife Klara (née Mehne) was sick then and he had to stay with her. Willimowski died in Karlsruhe, Germany, leaving behind four children - three daughters (Sylvia, Sigrid and Ulle) and a son, Rainer. Sylvia Haarke who lives in Hamburg, and in May 2007 visited Tarnowskie Góry with her husband Karl-Heinz Haarke (author of Wilimowski's biography), presented some interesting facts about her father. She said that Willimowski was a devout Roman Catholic, always emphasizing the role of religion in his life. On many occasions he would tell his children about his alleged encounter with Karol Wojtyła, later Pope John Paul II, which happened in the late 1930s in the Tatra Mountains. Also, after the famous Poland v Brazil (1938) game, Brazilian officials wanted to acquire his services. Willimowski had signed a preliminary contract, but it did not work out. According to Haarke, one of her father's biggest disappointments was not having been a member of the German team which won the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Legendary coach of the Polish national team, Kazimierz Górski, met Wilimowski at a hotel in Murrhardt during the World Championship in Germany in 1974. Gorski immediately recognized Ezi, because in the interbellum period, Wilimowski was one of his idols. Whenever Ruch Chorzow came to play in Lwów (now Lviv), Gorski always attended the games, watching Wilimowski. However, being observed by an agent of the Polish secret police SB, the Polish coach greeted his idol very coldly: Mr Wilimowski, if you had not done anything wrong, perhaps you should have come back to Poland, and explain your behavior, cleanse yourself of all charges - said Górski. I was afraid - answered Wilimowski.Urban, op.cit., p. 46. Literature *Karl-Heinz Harke, Georg Kachel; Fußball – Sport ohne Grenzen.

Tiger first appeared in Judomaster #91 (October 1966), and was created by Joe Gill and Frank McLaughlin. Publication history=Charlton Comics Tiger was the kid sidekick of the superhero Judomaster (Hadley \\"Rip\\" Jagger, a United States Army sergeant in World War II). In the \\"Nightshade\\" backup series in Captain Atom, an adult Tiger is shown to be Nightshade's martial arts instructor. DC Comics DC Comics purchased the rights to this character and others in 1983, during Charlton's final years. Here he was retconned as a member of the All-Star Squadron, DC's team of World War II superheroes, although he has never appeared in an actual published story as a member of said team. Fictional character biography=Judomaster According to his DC Comics history, during World War II, Tiger was a Japanese orphan who impressed the U.S. soldier Rip Jagger (Judomaster). Despite his young age, Tiger was skilled at martial arts and proved himself a worthy partner of Jagger. The team of Judomaster and Tiger became renowned throughout the Pacific, and both became members of the All-Star Squadron. After the War, Rip wanted to adopt Tiger and take the boy with him to the US, but immigration services denied his request. For many years, Rip and Tiger traveled the globe seeking out lost secrets of the martial arts. During this time, Tiger's anger grew and he started to unjustly believe that Rip resented him because he was what kept Rip from returning home. In 1953, Tiger had a final falling out with Rip and vanished. Avatar Tiger continued to travel across Asia, encountering thousands of orphans during his journeys. He began focusing his hatred upon the warmongers of the world, who had made so many children suffer. Studying the Hindu legends of the Parashurama, the slayer of the warrior caste, Tiger set out to recover the belongings of the god -- the Ax of Shiva, the All-Seeing Eye of Andhaka, and the precious Soma (a Serum of Immortality) which bestows upon its user eternal life when taken regularly. The serum came with a price -- it would supposedly drive its user mad over time -- but Tiger was willing to take that chance. Renaming himself Avatar, Tiger used his powerful tools to declare war against the world's war makers, intending to save the children of the world in his own twisted way. He defeated and kidnapped the Justice League, but was ultimately defeated by a new team of heroes (made up of Judomaster, Peacemaker, Blue Beetle, Nightshade, the Question, Captain Atom and Sarge Steel, all former Charlton Comics characters ) called the L.A.W.. Rip regretted battling his old friend and partner, but realized that Tiger had become truly insane. Assassin Both judoka survived their final fight and Avatar is currently at large, although now powerless. Tiger resurfaces in Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #11 (2008) and is referred to as the deadliest Yakuza assassin in Japan. In his work as a contract killer, he kills the father of Sonia Sato, a young metahuman who is spurred to be the third Judomaster, and follow him to America to enact her vengeance. When they later catch up, Sonia, acting on her dead lover Grant Emerson's last wishes and King Chimera's advice decides to spare him, administering him instead a vicious beating before taking away his assassination money and having him sent to jail JSA All-Stars #7 (August 2010) ReferencesExternal links * Entry on Judomaster & Tiger *Index to the Earth-4 adventures of the Charlton Action Heroes * * Judomaster & Tiger at the International Catalogue of Superheroes Category:Characters created by Joe Gill Category:Charlton Comics characters Category:Charlton Comics superheroes Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966 Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Fictional judoka ","title":"Tiger (DC Comics)"},{"id":"4467933","title":"Paul Meier (athlete)"},{"id":"4467938","text":"Lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) is an abnormal low density lipoprotein found in cholestasis.  Structure  Lipoprotein-X is a lamellar particle of 30 to 70 nm in diameter as revealed by electron microscopy. It is characterized by its high content of phospholipids (66% by weight) and unesterified cholesterol (22%), and its low content of protein (6%), cholesterol esters (3%), and triglycerides (3%). The protein component is dominated by albumin, located in the core, and by apolipoprotein C, located on the surface of the particle. Using zonal ultracentrifugation, lipoprotein-X can be divided into three distinct populations: Lp-X1, Lp-X2, and Lp-X3, differing in density and apolipoprotein composition.  Pathogenesis  The pathogenesis of lipoprotein-X in cholestasis is not totally resolved. Normally, the liver excretes lipoprotein complexes into the bile showing phospholipid and unesterified cholesterol concentrations similar to Lipoprotein-X. The in vitro incubation of these bile lipoproteins with serum or albumin leads to the appearance of Lp-X–like particles. These findings suggest that the reflux of bile into the plasma compartment causes the formation of lipoprotein-X in cholestasis as a result of a physicochemical, nonmetabolic process. On the other hand, lipoprotein-X particles found in familial LCAT deficiency are identical to those in cholestasis regarding ultrastructure and biochemical composition. It has been supposed that reduced LCAT activities, common in patients with hepatocellular disease, cause, alone or in combination with other factors, the formation of Lipoprotein-X in cholestasis. Lipoprotein-X is mainly removed by the reticuloendothelial system of the liver and the spleen, as shown by studies using radioactively labeled lipoprotein-X in rats. Other organs, such as the kidney, also actively clear Lipoprotein-X from the plasma.

He achieved three consecutive wins out of three entries in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Early life The youngest son of Fanny Bees and Barney Barnato, who had made a fortune as a \\"Randlord\\" in South African diamond and gold mining, he was a relative of the Joel family of entrepreneurs. Born at Spencer House, 27 St James's Place, London, he had a sister Leah Primrose (d.1933) and brother Isaac \\"Jack\\" Henry (d.1918 of bronchial pneumonia). The family divided their time between London, Brighton, Colwyn Bay and South Africa. In 1897, when Woolf was two years old, his father died near Madeira during a sea crossing from South Africa to London. The official verdict was suicide ('death by drowning while temporarily insane'). Woolf hence inherited his father's fortune at the time, but with the monies placed in trust. He inherited his first instalment of £250,000, in 1914 aged 19. In addition, Woolf benefited from a further inheritance after the murder of Woolf Barnato Joel in Johannesburg in 1898. Barnato was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Sports Barnato's attitude to a new sport that took his interests, was to immerse himself in the learning process, practising endlessly and taking lessons only from the very best instructors he could find. His desire to excel at whatever he attempted was considerable. He collected prizes, including the 1925 Duke of York Trophy, for motor boat racing, using his Bentley-powered boat 'Ardenrun V', a good amateur boxer and a keen shot. He bred horses at his house Ardenrun, and hunted with the Old Surrey and Burstow Foxhounds. He was a strong swimmer, and also played tennis to 'country house level'. He took golf lessons at Coombe Hill Golf Club, Kingston, Surrey, with the club professional Archie Compston, a friend of King Edward VIII. Career Barnato served as an officer in the Royal Field Artillery, British Army in World War I. Serving in France, Egypt and Palestine, he attained the rank of captain in the latter stages of the war. Having claimed a share of the business's profits from 1897 to 1916, in 1917 he broke off his business arrangements with the Joels. After a long legal dispute in South Africa, Woolf settled for £900,000 plus £50,000 in costs. He then sued his family for the £50,000, as well as £23,883 for disbursements. Following settlement of the case, Barnato played first-class cricket, appearing as wicket-keeper with Surrey County Cricket Club from 1928 to 1930. W. O. Bentley \\"Blower\\" Bentley Barnato purchased his first Bentley, a 3-litre, in 1925, 12 months before he acquired the business itself. With this car he won numerous Brooklands races. He was a member of a social set of wealthy British motorists known as the \\"Bentley Boys\\" who favoured the cars of W. O. Bentley. Many were independently wealthy, often with a background in military service. Barnato was nicknamed \\"Babe\\", in ironic deference to his heavyweight boxer's build. Inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by John Duff and Frank Clement, Barnato agreed to finance Bentley's business. Barnato had incorporated Baromans Ltd in 1922, which effectively existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested in excess of £100,000, saving the company and its workforce. A subsequent agreed wind-up of the original Bentley company was agreed, with all existing creditors paid off for £75,000, but with existing shares devalued from £1.00 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares, meaning that he controlled the company, and became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: £35,000 as a debenture in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929. With renewed financial input, W. O. Bentley was able to design another generation of cars, the six-cylinder 6½ Litre. However, the supercharged 4½ Litre (the famous \\"Blower\\" Bentley), which Barnato pushed through against Bentley's wishes, had poor durability and failed on the track. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 affected the Bentley business greatly, with the Great Depression reducing demand for the company's expensive products. In July 1931 two mortgage payments on the firm that were guaranteed by Barnato fell due, and accepting the inevitable, he advised the lenders that he was \\"unable to meet these debts.\\" On 10 July, on the application of the mortgagee, the court appointed a Receiver to Bentley Motors Limited.Receiver Appointed Of Bentley Motors Limited Re Bentley Motors Limited; London Life Association Limited v. Bentley Motors Limited, And Woolf Barnato. The Times, Saturday, 11 Jul 1931; pg. 4; Issue 45872 After a period where it appeared that Napier was going to acquire the business, the firm passed into the hands of Rolls-Royce in November 1931 for the sum of £125,000 after a sealed bid auction. Barnato received around £42,000 in return for his shares in the business, having bought a sizeable stake in Rolls-Royce not long before Bentley Motors was liquidated. By 1934 he was again on the board of Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd. Motor racing Barnato first went motor racing in 1921, when after importing an eight-litre Locomobile from the United States, he signed-up to race at the Brooklands Easter meeting. Having come third in the 100-mile Long Handicap, he then swapped to a Calthorpe to compete in the following Whitsun meeting. For the 1922 season he bought a 1921 chassis Talbot directly from its owner/driver Malcolm Campbell, and for 1923 a Sir Alastair Miller customised-racing Wolseley Racing Moth. At the start of the 1924 season Barnato obtained an eight-litre Hispano-Suiza H6C chassis, which he commissioned Jarvis of Wimbledon to build a suitable racing body for. Barnato then established an eight-litre class racing record for the car.https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/classic-life/woolf-babe-barnato- gentleman-driver In late 1924 he obtained a prototype Bentley 3 Litre chassis, which was subsequently fitted with a boat-tail body by Jarvis for a cost of £400. Barnato used the car to win several major Brooklands races, and then partnered by John Duff set a new 3 litre 24-hour record averaging at Autodrome de Montlhéry. Barnato later won the Brooklands Six Hour Race and Double Twelve Race in 1930. He was regarded by W.O. Bentley as, \\"The best driver we ever had and, I consider, the best British driver of his day. One who never made a mistake and always obeyed orders.\\" Le Mans As a driver, Barnato won the 24 Hours of Le Mans race three times: *1928 — with Bernard Rubin in a Bentley 4½ litre *1929 — with Sir Henry \\"Tim\\" Birkin in a Bentley Speed Six (\\"Old Number One\\") *1930 — with Glen Kidston in a Bentley Speed Six (\\"Old Number One\\") As these were the only years in which he entered the race, Barnato is the only Le Mans driver with a perfect wins-to-starts ratio. Bentley, under his chairmanship, also won the race in 1927, with Dr J. Dudley \\"Benjy\\" Benjafield and S. C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Davis in a Bentley 3 Litre. The Blue Train Races In March 1930 at the Carlton Hotel, Cannes, during the Blue Train Races, Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on Rover and its Rover Light Six. Having raced and beaten Le Train Bleu for the first time, Barnato claimed that he could not only beat the Blue Train from Cannes to Calais, but could reach London in his 6½ litre Bentley Speed Six before the train even reached Calais, on a bet of 100 pounds sterling. He set off from the bar of the Carlton Hotel at just before 6pm on 13 March, accompanied by his friend Dale Bourne as unofficial co-driver. They stopped for fuel at Aix-en-Provence, Lyon, Auxerre and Paris. He arrived at the docks in Boulogne at 10:30 am on 14 March, in time for the 11:30 sailing to Folkestone. Barnato reached Dale Bourne's club (the Conservative) in St James's, London, at around 3:30 pm, having covered the in 22½ hrs, at an average speed of . Barnato drove an H. J. Mulliner- bodied formal saloon in the race; the streamlined fastback \\"Sportsman Coupé\\" by Gurney Nutting which he took delivery of on 21 May 1930 also became known as the Blue Train Bentley and is regularly mistaken for or erroneously referred to as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race. Further confusion is caused by the well-known painting by Terence Cuneo which depicts the Gurney Nutting car. Both vehicles are still in existence. Later life From 1940 to 1945, Barnato was a wing commander with the Royal Air Force, responsible for the protection of aircraft factories against Nazi Luftwaffe bombing raids. He continued various low-key business opportunities out of his office on Park Lane. Personal life Barnato was married three times: *Dorothy Maitland Falk: 1915–1933, two daughters Virginia and Diana *Jacqueline Claridge : 1933–1947. The daughter of a wealthy American colliery owner; the couple had two sons Michael Jay, and Peter Woolf (1934–1959; died of cancer, San Francisco) *Joan Jenkinson:http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/inchiquin1543.htm December 1947 – his death. Barnato's daughter Diana Barnato Walker learned to fly at the Brooklands Flying Club in 1938 at the age of 20. She went on to ferry Spitfires, Hurricanes and Wellingtons with the Air Transport Auxiliary during World War II. Residences Barnato lived for most of the time in London, at his house at 39 Elsworthy Road, Hampstead when married to Dorothy Maitland and, after his divorce, at his flat at 50 Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, on the south east corner of the square. Other Bentley Boys also had flats in the same block and, such was the number of Bentley cars parked outside, the location was known to taxi drivers as 'Bentley's Corner'. He also owned Ardenrun Place, a country house situated near Lingfield, Surrey. Originally built in 1906–1909 by Ernest Newton for the Konig family, the house was the scene of many lavish motor racing-themed parties for Barnato and his friends, but was destroyed by fire on 14 March 1933. He also owned the nearby Nuthill Farm in Redhill, which was used by his ex-wife Dorothy and his daughters Diana and Virginia at weekends. After the loss of Ardenrun, in 1938 he built a large castellated home named Ridgemead in Englefield Green, Surrey, at a cost of more than £100,000. Designed by Robert Lutyens, son of Sir Edwin Lutyens, Ridgemead featured innovations such as central heating, a 'talkie' cinema and a drive lit by secret light rays. It had 25 bedrooms, a heated swimming pool and was set in of land overlooking the River Thames at Runnymede. Upon Barnato's death in 1948, his wife Joan sold the house for £25,000 and it became a nursing home, which it remains. During his final marriage, he purchased an plot named Perot's Island, in Bermuda, \\"as an investment after my death\\". Death Barnato died at the London Clinic, Devonshire Place, on 27 July 1948 as a result of a thrombosis after an operation for cancer. His funeral cortege was led by his Bentley 'Old Number One', which was covered with flowers and wreaths. He is buried at St Jude's Church in Englefield Green, Surrey (grave 286, plot 25), next to his son-in- law Derek Walker (who had married his daughter Diana in 1944 and was killed in an aircraft crash in 1945) and next to his daughter Diana. Estimates of his wealth at the time of his death were between £1.5 and £5 million. Posthumous honours The Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) named its highest award in Barnato's honour; the first Woolf Barnato Award was presented in 1948, and has been presented every year from 1948 to the present (including the period it was renamed the Carl Haas Award, 1994–2001).http://www.scca.com/pages/scca-awards SCCA Awards Recipients are nominated by the past three winners and approved by SCCA's board of directors.The Sports Car Club of America – About References * Malcolm Bobbitt – W.

Unraveling the mechanisms of complex chemical reactions, Ross opened new avenues in physical chemistry through the development of groundbreaking methods to study complex reactions within intact systems. His theoretical and experimental studies in statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics proved new means to reveal details of biochemical reactions taking place far from equilibrium and involving many chemical species. Education and career * B.S., 1948, Queens College * Ph.D., 1951, Massachusetts Institute of Technology * Postdoctoral Scholar, 1953, Yale University, Statistical Mechanics Born in Vienna in 1926, Ross left Austria with his parents only days before the outbreak of World War II. They settled in New York, where he studied chemistry at Queens College (B.S. 1948), with a two- year interruption to serve in the Army from 1944 to 1946. After completing his degree, he went on to perform doctoral research in physical chemistry, studying gas transport properties under the guidance of Isador Amdur at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Ph.D. 1951). This led to postdoctoral work in gas thermometry and the statistical mechanical theory of irreversible processes with physical chemist John Kirkwood at Yale. Ross began his faculty career as assistant professor in chemistry at Brown University in 1953. There, he launched a program to test the viscosity of liquids as a function of temperature and pressure with unprecedented precision. Two years later, he and physical chemist Edward Greene began nearly two decades of groundbreaking work developing the use of molecular beams to examine the molecular dynamics – revealing details of molecular collisions, dispersion, and more during chemical reactions. In 1966 Ross joined the Chemistry Department faculty at MIT, where he served as chair from 1966 to 1971. He came to Stanford in 1979 as professor of chemistry and was department chair from 1983 to 1989. Among many honors recognizing his broad contributions in physical chemistry, Professor Ross was named to the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received the U.S. National Medal of Science in 2000 from President Clinton. In his research at Stanford, Ross examined experimental and theoretical investigations in new approaches to the determination of complex reaction mechanisms, the formation of the thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of systems far from equilibrium, the chemical implementation of digital and parallel computers, and application of these studies to biological reaction mechanisms. His contributions in reaction kinetics and dynamics changed chemists’ understanding of reactivity and why many chemical phenomena occur, opening new fields in chemical science.

She was a recipient of the . Life Naranjo was born in Cartago, the capital city of the Cartago Province. She received her primary education there at the Escuela República de Perú and her secondary at the Colegio Superior de Señoritas. She received her licenciatura in Philology from the University of Costa Rica and pursued post-graduate studies at the Universidad Autónoma de México and the University of Iowa. Naranjo served as Costa Rica's ambassador to Israel in the 1970s and also as the country's minister of culture. She was the author of the Costa Rican system of social security. She was inducted into La Galería de las Mujeres de Costa Rica (The Women's Gallery of Costa Rica) in 2005.  Literary career  Naranjo wrote multiple books, including poetry, novels, storybooks, and essays. Her novels and stories have had much success, such as her first novel Los perros no ladraron (1966); however, Naranjo is also known for her poetry, such as La canción de la ternura (1964) and Hacia tu isla (1966). After Naranjo returned to Costa Rica in 1964, having worked for United Nations in Venezuela, her literary career began to take off. She enrolled in a writer's workshop, led by Lilia Ramos (Costa Rican essayist), she began reading work by Latin American authors such as Carlos Fuentes, Juan Rulfo, Jorge Luis Borges, and Octavio Paz, and she published her first volumes of poetry, Hacia tu isla (1966) and Misa a oscuras (1964). She published her first novel, Los perros no ladraron in 1966, and in 1968, two more followed: Memorias de un hombre de palabra and Camino al mediodía. The success she had from her first three novels opened an international opportunity for her career and literary reputation. Upon accepting an invitation to the University of Iowa in the United States, Naranjo spent a year in 1969 in the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she completed her next novel, Diario de una multitud (published in 1974). In 1970, after much success with Camino al mediodía, which won second place in The Central American and Panama Flower Games (Los Juegos Florales Centroamericanos y de Panamá), she began to teach workshops (writing classes), and as a direct result of these classes, Naranjo was inspired to write her next notable novel, Responso Por El Niño Juan Manuel (1970).

Dimidiata has been found in rock piles, caves occupied by bats, hollow trees occupied by mammals or birds, and other diverse ecotopes.

The name Drygas is actually a registered trademarked brand name, owned by Cristy Corporation. It is a liquid that is added into the fuel tank, that absorbs the water and keeps it in solution. Some brands contain methanol and some contain isopropyl alcohol. Some states require a 10-15% ethanol solution be sold at refueling stations. Most current gasoline-powered automobiles can safely run up to a 10% ethanol solution without any modification. However, at 15% or above older vehicles may require replacing the fuel lines to prevent degradation and rupture, and the electric fuel pump may need modification to prevent ethanol \\"dry rot\\". The belief that dry gas is not needed because of the significant amount of ethanol is largely true because ethanol is a drying agent. Due to this fact it has an affinity for water which can be present in the atmosphere, but since environmental concerns have caused fuel systems to be closed, it works effectively on the moisture inside the tank which was already present. The water that has been \\"absorbed\\" then reduces issues with freezing fuel lines. The action of adding dry gas (anhydrous methanol or azeotropic iso-propyl alcohol) is suggested to mix with absorbed water lowering the freezing point of the now water and alcohol solution, lower than it would mixed with ethanol, allowing the fuel lines to better resist freezing, while non-frozen water will be removed when either solution is used by the engine.

Temporary stations were opened in 1848 and 1870, with construction of the main station commencing in the 1890s. The station was closed completely in 1965 and largely demolished in 1969-70. Only its hotel remains, but it is no longer in railway ownership. Previous stations In April 1847, the foundation stone for the Caledonian Railway company's Edinburgh station was ceremonially laid. Designed by William Tite, the station was to be a large Italianate structure. Due to the railway company's lack of funds this was not built and when the first services arrived in February 1848 there was only a temporary station with basic facilities, called Lothian Road Station from its location on that street. By 1870, with increasing traffic, it was decided to build a new station slightly further north, still on Lothian Road but nearer Princes Street. Renamed Princes Street Station, it was opened in May 1870. It was built of timber with a pitched, slated roof. In June 1890, the building, which had been called the \\"wooden shanty\\", suffered a major blaze. Construction of the Princes Street terminus drawing of 1890s station 1901 station plan – north is to the right Edinburgh Princes Street Station of 1894+, interior of the trainshed. Hotel under construction Due to further increases in traffic, plans had already been made for a new station and between 1890 and 1893 a grand station with seven platforms and an 850 ft long bayed roof was erected. Initially it had its own power station, to the west of the station in Rutland Court, to power its lighting. Parcels and goods were dealt with at the nearby Lothian Road station. In 1899, work started on building a grand railway hotel above the main three archway entrance of the station, and opened in 1903 as Princes Street Station Hotel. It was commonly known as The Caledonian Hotel. It was designed by Edinburgh architects, Peddie and Washington Browne. The main pedestrian entrance to the station became the right hand arch of the original three while vehicular access was by way of Rutland Street. Both the station and the hotel were built in red sandstone in common with most Caledonian Railway buildings. Mainline and suburban services The cab road alongside platform 2, in 1934 The mainline to London, via Carstairs, headed southwest from the station, which was later augmented with a number of suburban stops, Merchiston, Slateford, and Kingsknowe, and a branchline to Colinton and Balerno. The Caledonian railway company later added other suburban lines serving the north and west of the city, including Barnton, Davidson's Mains, Granton, and Leith. In 1901, on weekdays, there were five trains a day to England, 20 to Carlisle, 16 to Glasgow (11 taking 65mins), 10 to Aberdeen and local trains to Balerno, Cramond Brig (later renamed Barnton) and Leith. There were also through coaches to many destinations, including Liverpool, Manchester, Oban and Stranraer. Closure View of preserved station gates from Rutland Street After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, it was considered logical to concentrate all rail services in Edinburgh at one station. With Waverley Station a short distance along Princes Street beyond Princes Street Gardens, by the 1960s Princes Street Station was seen as surplus to requirements. Although its street-level entrance was rather more convenient for travellers than that of Waverley (which is in the valley between Princes Street and the Old Town and requires a steep climb to reach street level), the latter was much larger, more conveniently located within the city, and (crucially) had access to the East Coast Main Line. After closure of Princes Street, the west of the city would continue to be served by nearby Haymarket Station. Local services were gradually withdrawn, starting with those to Balerno in 1943, followed by those to Barnton in 1951, Leith North in 1962, and stopping trains on the main line to Carstairs in 1964. The remaining services to Glasgow Central, Stirling and English cities were then diverted to Waverley, allowing Princes Street Station to be closed in September 1965. The station was demolished in 1969-70, with the West Approach Road being built along the track bed in the early 1970s. The hotel still operates on the site and has been renamed the Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian. Part of the station space still remains within it and the vehicle entrance screen is still visible at the side of the hotel. The former Parcels Office survived on Lothian Road between the hotel and the West Approach Road, until a major office development was constructed on its site in the 1990s.

He began his career in vaudeville as an actor and sketch writer. He became best known for his satiric comedies, including The Torch-Bearers (1922) and The Show-Off (1924). Early life Kelly was born in Philadelphia on January 16, 1887. He was the second youngest of ten children born to Mary Ann (née Costello) and John Henry Kelly, Irish immigrants. He was the brother of American businessman and Olympic champion sculler John B. Kelly Sr. and the uncle of actress Grace Kelly, who became Princess consort of Monaco, and Olympic rower John B. Kelly Jr. Not much is known about his early life, but he was an actor in his early years. He did not like the dramatic material available during the turn of the century, and wanted to change that. He served in France during World War I and after he came home starting writing. Career Throughout his career, Kelly remained a realistic playwright, unaffected by the experiments of theatrical modernism. Novelist Edward Maisel described him as \\"a simple moralist using the theatre for simple moral purposes.\\" Kelly's plays are often dominated by characters of monstrous egotism, and he casts a harsh light on their shortcomings. Uncompromising in his vision, he scrupulously avoided sentimentality and depictions of romance. Arthur Willis noted \\"Kelly appears to be anti-love, anti-romantic love, certainly, and distrustful of the tender emotions.\\" In his first full-length play, The Torch-Bearers, Kelly satirizes the \\"Little Theatre Movement\\", depicting it as made up of narcissistic and undisciplined amateurs. Their leader, Mrs. J. Duro Pampinelli, is a brilliant caricature of self- indulgent dilettantism. In the first act, Kelly shows the troupe incapable of conducting a competent rehearsal; in the second, he depicts with farcical brilliance their public performance collapsing in shambles. In the third act, however, the tone grows more earnest as the players are excoriated for their indulgences. In his greatest popular and commercial success, The Show-Off, Kelly focuses his critique on the figure of Aubrey Piper, a loud, lying, self- deluded businessman with an obnoxious laugh and an obvious toupee. With Craig's Wife (1925), Kelly's satire grew more severe; Harriet Craig destroys her marriage through her possessiveness and materialism. In his later plays, Kelly grew even more severe and judgmental, and his audiences grew smaller. Behold the Bridegroom (1927) shows a shallow and decadent flapper pine away when she meets a morally upright man who makes her realize her lack of character. Despite a much-praised performance by Judith Anderson in the leading role, the play ran for only 88 performances. Philip Goes Forth (1931) is the story of a young man who is much enamored of his image of himself as a young playwright. He rebels against his family and moves into a boarding house for artists, only to discover that he has no talent. It enjoyed a run of only 97 performances. Two late plays, Maggie the Magnificent (1929) and The Deep Mrs. Sykes (1929), were very poorly received and were never even published. As a result of the box-office failure of his later works, Kelly moved to Hollywood, and only rarely returned to the theatre. The Fatal Weakness (1946) was his last Broadway play. At the time of his death, four of his plays remained unperformed and have yet to premiere. Personal life George Kelly, a \\"life-long bachelor,\\" maintained a 55-year relationship with his lover William Eldon Weagley (27 November 1896 - 16 October 1975), the son of John Adams Weagley and Ella Frances Weagley, up until his death. Weagley was often referred to as his valet. That Kelly was gay was a closely guarded secret and went unacknowledged by his family to the point of not inviting Weagley to his funeral; he instead slipped in and sat quietly on a back seat. Kelly died on June 18, 1974 at the Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, after several years of living in Sun City, a desert retirement village in Riverside, California.

It is the largest art school in the Czech Republic, with more than 350 educators and researchers, and 1500 students. The academy consists of three faculties: a Film and TV School (FAMU); Music and Dance Faculty (HAMU); and Theatre Faculty (DAMU), offering Bachelor, Masters, and Doctoral level courses, as well as conducting artistic research, and in some departments also research in art history and theory. AMU has two cross- faculty pedagogical facilities: a Languages Centre and a Sports, Rehabilitation and Movement Centre. The university also has two facilities outside Prague designed for residential multi-day creative projects.  History  The Academy of Performing Arts was founded by a Presidential Decree of 27 October 1945, and opened to students the next year, in the winter semester of 1946. The establishment of the school was initiated by a group of artists and writers, including , , and , during World War II. Professors of the older Prague Conservatory also supported the idea of transforming the former maestro school into a university. Writers, artists and other film- makers with practical experience in the film industry, including Jaroslav Bouček, Karel Plicka, Otakar Vávra, Ivan Olbracht, Vítězslav Nezval, and , contributed to the school’s future curriculum, designing it to reflect new trends in post-war film development. Later the Film Studio and the DISK theatre, belonging to the Theatre Faculty, were added. The Opera Studio of the Music Faculty also uses the DISK theatre. When the medium of television emerged, the Film and TV School began offering study programmes for TV specialists. It also has a department with a still photography curriculum.  Faculties  The Academy of Performing Arts consists of a Film and TV School (FAMU), Music and Dance Faculty, Theatre Faculty, and a rector’s office. Besides the DISK theatre and Film Studio, the Academy's teaching facilities include sound and photography studios, laboratories, workshops, dancing and training halls. The Lichtenštejn Palace, renovated in 1991, contains a grand concert hall dedicated to the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinů and the Inspirace theatre. The Academy owns out-of-town practice and teaching centres in Poněšice and Beroun. The Study and Training Centre in Poněšice, South Bohemia, is situated on the River Vltava River, and is used for special training programmes, sports and language courses for students and other users. The Study, Training and Accommodation Centre in Beroun, 30 kilometres west of Prague, is used for training and study activities and workshops for DAMU, HAMU, FAMU and Studio FAMU. Theatre Faculty (DAMU) The Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU) was established in 1945 as part of the newly created arts university. Teachers at the faculty have included prominent personalities of modern Czech theatre including Otomar Krejča, , Ivan Vyskočil. DAMU is a member of the European League of Institutes of the Arts (ELIA) and the European Network of Cultural Administration Training Centres (ENCATC). Film and TV School (FAMU) The Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) was established in 1946, as the world’s fifth university-level arts school with a programme in film education. At the end of the 1960s, a number of the school's graduates emerged as part of the Czechoslovak New Wave movement, including Věra Chytilová, Miloš Forman, and Jiří Menzel. Later graduates of the school to receive international acclaim included Agnieszka Holland, Emir Kusturica, and Jan Svěrák. FAMU is a founding member of the International Association of Film and Television Schools (CILECT), and a member of ELIA and the European Grouping of Film and Television Schools (GEECT). Music and Dance Faculty (HAMU) The Music and Dance Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts (; HAMU) was established in 1945 as one of the academy’s three components, as a successor to the master school of the Prague Conservatory. The school provides education in the fields of music and dance in Czech and English at Bachelor, Masters and doctoral levels. The faculty has 12 departments (the Departments of String, Keyboard, Wind and Percussion Instruments, Jazz Interpretation, Voice and Opera Directing, Musical Sound, Theory and History of Music, Conducting, Composition and Pantomime). The faculty also includes three research facilities: the Institute of Music Theory, the Institute for Dance Theory, and the Musical Acoustics Research Centre (MARC). HAMU is the organiser of the orchestral cycle \\"The Best\\" and the Skrznaskrz festival, which features collaborations between all three AMU faculties as well as other fine arts schools. Academics The academy runs bachelor, master, and doctoral study programmes covering Art of Music, Art of Dance, Art of Drama, Art of Film, TV and Photography, and New Media. Bachelor study programmes usually last three years and students receive Bachelor of Arts degrees (BcA). Master study programmes usually take two further years. After passing the state examination, students receive Master of Arts degrees (MgA). Doctoral study programmes are established at all the faculties. On passing a doctoral examination and presenting a doctoral theses, students are awarded doctorates (Ph.D). The academy offers other special courses outside the regular university study programme, some of which can be used as credit. Students at the academy are only accepted after completing secondary school education and successfully passing entrance exams. Each faculty has its own requirements for the entrance exams. The official language of instruction of the course units is Czech, but each faculty offers some degree programs in English. A limited number of short-term courses are taught in English or in German, and for others a preparatory course in Czech is necessary. Facilities and student services AMU has a library with more than 180,000 volumes of academic literature, sound recordings and audio-visual works, and students are also entitled to use other libraries free of charge, such as the University library and the library of the Czech Academy of Sciences. Students of the academy have free or discounted entry to some cultural events, such as theatre performances, concerts, exhibitions, lectures and films. The academy has co- operative links with other schools in the Czech Republic and internationally, which include artistic competitions, festivals, and reciprocal exchange performances. AMU's facilities include theatres, film and television studios, and concert halls. A university publishing service, AMU Press (NAMU), publishes literature about AMU artistic activities. The final projects of students studying disciplines with a significant graphic component are exhibited in the AMU Gallery (GAMU), which also hosts one-off thematic exhibitions. AMU has two halls of residence: one on Hradební Street in the centre of Prague, reconstructed in the academic year 2006/07, and another on the southern outskirts of Prague. The academy's Language Centre provides classes in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian and Czech for students and employees. The AMU Sports, Rehabilitation and Movement Centre organises various sports activities for students. Notable alumni=DAMUFAMU Several of the directors considered part of the Czechoslovak New Wave attended FAMU, including Miloš Forman (b. 1932), Jiří Menzel (b. 1938), Jan Němec, Juraj Jakubisko, Věra Chytilová, Ivan Passer, and Vojtěch Jasný.

The album was recorded in one day and consists of improvised, solo electric guitar. Background and reception Tim Griggs of AllMusic called it \\"semi-organized noise.\\" Griggs has two theories about the album's origins. The first is that Metheny was upset with Geffen, and as his contract was ending this was his way of expressing his displeasure. In 2008, Metheny said, > That rumor was started by a journalist who was seriously not listening to > the album. All it would have taken was a quick phone call [to me] to find > out that that wasn't the case. Besides, I would never do something like > that.

To > me, it is a 2-D view of a world in which I am usually functioning in a more > 3-D way. It is entirely flat music, and that was exactly what it was > intended to be. Griggs's second theory is that Metheny simply made the kind of album he wanted to make.

It is found at , and . Passage The parables follow the recruitment of Levi as a disciple of Jesus, and appear to be part of a discussion at a banquet held by him ().Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , pp. 248-250. The parables are told in response to a question about fasting: Jesus' response continues with the two short parables. Luke has the more detailed version: Interpretation The two parables relate to the relationship between Jesus' teaching and traditional Judaism. According to some interpreters, Jesus here \\"pits his own, new way against the old way of the Pharisees and their scribes.\\" In the early second century, Marcion, founder of Marcionism, used the passage to justify a \\"total separation between the religion that Jesus and Paul espoused and that of the Hebrew Scriptures.\\"Joseph B. Tyson, Marcion and Luke-Acts: A defining struggle, University of South Carolina Press, 2006, , p. 32. Other interpreters see Luke as giving Christianity roots in Jewish antiquity, although \\"Jesus has brought something new, and the rituals and traditions of official Judaism cannot contain it.\\"R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An introduction and commentary, Eerdmans, 1985, , p. 169. In his commentary on Matthew, Mark, and Luke,Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 31: Matthew, Mark and Luke, Part I John Calvin states that the old wineskins and the old garment represent Jesus' disciples, and the new wine and unshrunk cloth represent the practice of fasting twice a week. Fasting this way would be burdensome to the new disciples, and would be more than they could bear.Calvin's Commentary, Volume XVI, Baker: Grand Rapids, 1981, p. 408; also online. Based on parallel rabbinic sayings found in Pirkei Avot, one interpreter sees the parable as depicting the difficulty of teaching disciples with prior learning as compared to teaching new, uneducated disciples. The metaphors in the two parables were drawn from contemporary culture.James R. Edwards, The Gospel According to Mark, Eerdmans, 2002, , pp. 91-92. New cloth had not yet shrunk, so that using new cloth to patch older clothing would result in a tear as it began to shrink.Craig S. Keener, A Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew, Eerdmans, 1999, , pp. 300-301. Similarly, old wineskins had been \\"stretched to the limit\\" or become brittle as wine had fermented inside them; using them again therefore risked bursting them.

Nova Scotia's Appeal Court had ruled the legislation violated the guarantee of freedom of expression in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, by constraining communication in relation to legal activity (R. v. Skinner (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 203). The case was referred to the Supreme court. The Supreme Court held that the criminal code provision that prohibited communication for the purpose of engaging in prostitution was in violation of the right to freedom of expression; however, it could be justified under section 1 of the Charter and so it was upheld. The majority on a 5:2 split, with both women dissenting, found that the purpose of eliminating prostitution was a valid goal and that the provision was rationally connected and proportional to that goal. Accordingly, the provision was upheld. The justification was set out in three stages: # The court must first characterize the objective of the law (a remedy for solicitation in public places and the eradication of social nuisance from the public display of the sale of sex). This was constructed as restricted to taking prostitution off the streets and out of public view. In this respect, Dickson disagreed with the opinion of another justice that the legislative objective addressed the broader questions of the exploitation, degradation and subordination of women. # The court must assess the proportionality of the legislation to the objectives; in particular any infringement of rights must be the minimum to achieve this. It was held the provisions were not unduly intrusive. # The court must determine if the effects of the law so infringe a protected right that it outweighs the objective. It was held that the curtailment of street solicitation was in keeping with the interests of society, for its nuisance‑related aspects. The decision was later upheld in Canada (AG) v Bedford.

Gaelic  Manan (Man-án, also spelled Mannan) is a name with Gaelic roots. Manan is \\"a new beginning \\" or \\"morning \\", a \\"new day\\" or \\"opportunity\\". It insinuates a positive feeling towards an opportunity, or fresh start. According to a popular legend in Irish folklore, \\"The Giant Boulder\\" - the name of the hero in the story was Manan. Manan saved the Irish village from destruction by positioning a giant boulder blocking the sea, preventing the town's inhabitants from drowning; that village later called every clan leader by the honorary name of Manan, and it stands for honor, strength, and greatness.  Sanskrit  Manan (; ) means deep thought, contemplation, or profound reflection. The root of the word is man (Sanskrit मन) — the mind — i.e., the faculty that produces thoughts and feelings. In Vedanta group of Hindu philosophical traditions (see, for instance, ), there are three steps to self- realization: (1) \\"shravana\\" i.e., careful listening to the teaching of the Vedanta, (2) \\"manana\\" i.e., repeatedly and deeply reflecting on or contemplating what is learned from those teachings, and (3) \\"nididhyasana\\" i.e., becoming completely absorbed in contemplation that no other thought enters the mind. The Sanskrit derived Manan is a relatively uncommon name given to males in India.  Tamil  Mannan means \\"king\\" or \\"leader\\" in Tamil.  Persian  The name Manan can also be of Persian background and is given to males. Manan's meaning encompasses the ideas of conscience, mind, and soul. It insinuates the qualities of thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and consideration. The name apparently also means fun-loving, naughty, and joyous as well as disciplined and righteous. A \\"Manan\\" would not agree with or appreciate wrongdoing, unmannered persons.  Arabic  Manan or Mannan is a name that is also found in Islam; it's an Arabic name. Generally, this is not used alone, as it's preceded by names like Abdul etc. (Abdul Manan or Abdul Mannan, means Slave of the God), it is so because Manan is one of God's names, hence the name Abdul Manan is given.

He volunteered for a number of charitable organisations and was a major donor to the Labour Party. Rosenfeld was one of twelve wealthy donors to the Labour Party named in the Cash for Honours scandal of 2006. In 2012 he co- founded The People's Operator, a mobile telephone company. Early life Rosenfeld had a bachelor's degree in Estate Management from South Bank Polytechnic, and thereafter qualified as a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.

Formerly he was a Jewish Care trustee. He was a Vice-President of the NSPCC and was Chairman of the Full Stop Fellowship. Political involvement Before the 2005 General Election he lent £1,033,000 to the Labour Party as part of the Cash for Honours scandal and, in partial return, was invited to a private dinner with Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street. Rosenfeld denied that he made the loan expecting to receive an honour in exchange although he was nominated for one by some of Blair's top aides. It was subsequently repaid in full by 2009. In 2010 Rosenfeld had abandoned his support of the Labour Party, choosing to endorse David Cameron, the Conservative candidate. Rosenfeld said that Cameron was \\"the man for the job – no doubt about it\\" and that the Labour Party had \\"run out of time.\\" By 2011 Rosenfeld was again backing the Labour Party, having emerged as its \\"most generous private donor.\\" He had announced that he would donate £1 million to the Labour Party for the 2015 general election campaign.

Jones (June 21, 1817 – December 26, 1900), was born on a plantation in Leesburg, Virginia, he was enslaved by the Ellzey family. Jones is buried in Woodlawn National Cemetery, not far from Mark Twain. He was married to Rachel Jones (née Swails) in 1856, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. On June 3, 1844, fearing he would be sold to another plantation, as his enslaver grew old and near death, Jones and four others fled north. They survived a 300-mile trip and arrived in Elmira, New York in July 1844. In Elmira, Jones was an active agent in the Underground Railroad. Slave life and escape As a youngster, Jones was the houseboy of William Ellzey’s daughter, Miss Sally. Miss Sarah (Sally) Ellzey was fond of John and was a good friend to him. But she was getting on in years, and John was concerned about what would happen to him once she died. On June 3, 1844, he left with his two half-brothers, George and Charles, along with Jefferson Brown and John Smith, who were enslaved people at a nearby estate. They followed the Underground Railroad that went through Williamsport, Canton, Alba and South Creek. While fleeing, Jones and his companions fought off slave hunters in Maryland and made their way into the free state of Pennsylvania. They continued heading north and took refuge in New York in a barn on South Creek Farm owned by Dr. Nathaniel Smith. Mrs. Smith found the exhausted and hungry fugitives and cared for them until they could continue their journey. Jones is believed to have been so grateful that after she died, flowers mysteriously appeared on her grave until Jones died. The five men reached Elmira on July 5, 1844. Underground Railroad Jones' adopted home of Elmira was a major stop for the Underground Railroad. Most of the people who were escaping slavery that passed through came via Harrisburg and Williamsport, continuing their route to Rochester or another \\"station.\\" Elmira's participation in the Underground Railroad was significant due to its location between Philadelphia and St. Catharines, Ontario; the final destination for many escaping slavery. At one point in July 1845, 17 people who were escaping slavery were in the Elmira area, hiding on farms and at other places. The completion of the Northern Central Railway after 1850 further escalated Elmira's contribution to the Underground Railroad. The new railway allowed people who were escaping slavery to hide in baggage cars, making their journey quicker and easier. Jones became an active agent in the Underground Railroad in 1851. By 1860, Jones aided in the escape of 860 people who had been enslaved. He usually received the fugitives in parties of six to ten, but there were times he found shelter for up to 30 men, women, and children a night. It is believed Jones sheltered many in his own home behind First Baptist Church. Of those 860, none were captured or returned to the South. In 1854 the tracks from Williamsport to Elmira were completed. Jones made an arrangement with Northern Central employees and hid the fugitives in the 4 o'clock \\"Freedom Baggage Car,\\" directly to Niagara Falls via Watkins Glen and Canandaigua. Most of Jones's \\"baggage\\" eventually landed in St. Catharine's. Employment Some of his early jobs in Elmira included chopping wood, working in a candle shop, and cleaning as a janitor for Miss Clara Thurston's school for young ladies on Main Street. Sexton at First Baptist Jones became the sexton of Elmira's First Baptist Church in 1847 and purchased a house next to the church for $500. During this time, Jones kept a record of the church's dead buried at the Second Street Cemetery. In the days when he was sexton of the First Baptist Church, there was no paid fire department. As was the practice, a volunteer fireman would rush to Jones' little \\"yellow house\\" to rout him out to go to the church and ring the bells to summon the other volunteers. After other churches obtained bells, there became a contest to see which sexton could be the first to ring the alarm. A $2.00 fee was paid by the fireman to the sexton whose bell rang first. Jones generally won the contest by cleverly attaching one end of a rope to the bell clapper and the other end to his bed post. Jones continued to serve as sexton for First Baptist Church for 43 years. Burial of Confederate soldiers Confederate memorial at Woodlawn National Cemetery During the Civil War, he buried the Confederate dead from the Elmira Prison Camp at Woodlawn National Cemetery. Of the 2,963 prisoners who Jones buried, only seven are listed as unknown. Jones kept such precise records that on December 7, 1877 the federal government declared the burial site a national cemetery. His extensive records allowed the federal government to place accurate headstones on all but seven of the 2,973 Confederate graves in 1907. Each coffin was clearly marked with any information that the soldier had been willing to share; the information also was placed in a sealed bottle inside the coffin. Any valuables owned by the soldier at the time of his death were carefully cataloged and stored. The graves were identified with wooden markers and arranged in a pattern that suggested soldiers lined up for inspection. They were surrounded by the graves of Union soldiers, grouped as though they were still on guard. When the families received the precious family photographs, treasures, letters, and remembrances that Jones had kept for them, they were so moved that only three bodies were removed for reburial. When the son of the Ellzey's enslaver and overseer, John R. Rollins, died at the prison camp, Jones arranged to send the body back to the family. And a few years after the war, Jones returned to the Ellzey plantation and was warmly received. Jones received $2.50 from the government for each Confederate soldier buried. This money eventually enabled him to buy his College Avenue farm and to be rated as the wealthiest black man in this part of the state. The John W. Jones House still stands at a Davis Street location on the original farm property. and Accompanying 4 photos, from 2003 Personal life John was married to Rachel Jones (née Swails), the sister of Stephen Atkins Swails, in 1856; they had three sons and one daughter together. One of his sons, George Henry Jones, died on October 20, 1864 at only three years of age. ReferencesExternal links * John W. Jones Museum * John Jones Biography from City of Elmira * John W.

A native of Los Angeles, California, Oreck became a member of the Los Angeles Police Department following a stint in the United States Army. While continuing his service with law enforcement, he began taking small acting assignments, which gradually increased in importance until, in the late 1950s, he could be spotted in various installments of television programs. In 1959, Oreck portrayed the lead in the episode \\"Gringo Pete\\" of Rex Allen's syndicated western series, Frontier Doctor. In the story line, Gringo Pete is an outlaw who pledges to surrender his gang in exchange for parole. Instead, he resumes his life of lawlessness and dares the authorities. Personal life In 1955, Oreck married 20-year-old Joanna Moore who, after their divorce in 1957, became a well-known movie and TV actress who later married Ryan O'Neal. His second marriage, to Tulsa-born Mary Ann Powell (born August 19, 1930), lasted from 1958 to 1971 and produced two children, Kevin Robert and Elizabeth Diane.

The ANVT-ILRF was given permission to carry out experimental lessons in four public schools (in Esquelbecq, Noordpeene, Volckerinckhove, Wormhout) for the school years of 2007–08 until 2010–11, after which it would be evaluated. Afterwards, all requirements were met but it was only allowed to continue them, but not to expand to other schools or to the collège. On the other hand, the private Catholic education began teaching standard Benelux Dutch in collèges in Gravelines and Hondschoote.

He was a son of Mikhail of Tver and Anna of Kashin. Dmitry continued his father's fight with Grand Prince Yuri Danilovich of Moscow for the yarlik (also iarlik) that is, the diploma or patent of office for the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir, which was granted by the Khan of the Golden Horde. The title was much desired because the Grand Prince of Vladimir was the khan's tax-collector in Rus', and as such could gain authority and real power over the other princes of Rus'. Following Yury's machinations which led the khan to grant the yarlik to Moscow and their father's execution at the Horde in 1318, Dmitry and his brother, Alexander, fought a series of battles with Yury and intrigued against him at the Horde, culminating in Dmitry's acquisition of the yarlik of office for the grand princely throne in 1322 and his murder of Yury at the Horde (in Sarai) three years later. Dmitry was himself arrested for the murder and executed in Sarai on the orders of Uzbeg Khan in 1326.

Such systems are typical in garage door openers and keyless car entry systems.  Techniques  * Common PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) -- preferably cryptographically secure -- in both transmitter and receiver * Transmitter sends 'next' code in sequence * Receiver compares 'next' to its calculated 'next' code. * A typical implementation compares within the next 256 codes in case receiver missed some transmitted keypresses.  Application in RF remote control  A rolling code transmitter is useful in a security system for providing secure encrypted radio frequency (RF) transmission comprising an interleaved trinary bit fixed code and rolling code. A receiver demodulates the encrypted RF transmission and recovers the fixed code and rolling code. Upon comparison of the fixed and rolling codes with stored codes and determining that the signal has emanated from an authorized transmitter, a signal is generated to actuate an electric motor to open or close a movable component.  Rolling code vs. fixed code RF remote control  Remote controls send a digital code word to the receiver. If the receiver determines the codeword is acceptable, then the receiver will actuate the relay, unlock the door, or open the barrier. Simple remote control systems use a fixed code word; the code word that opens the gate today will also open the gate tomorrow. An attacker with an appropriate receiver could discover the code word and use it to gain access sometime later. More sophisticated remote control systems use a rolling code (or hopping code) that changes for every use. An attacker may be able to learn the code word that opened the door just now, but the receiver will not accept that code word for the foreseeable future. A rolling code system uses encryption methods that allow the remote control and the receiver to share codewords but make it difficult for an attacker to break the encryption.  KeeLoq  HCS301 chip from an Audi A6 keyless entry remote, which uses a rolling code system The Microchip HCS301 was once the most widely used system on garage and gate remote control and receivers. The chip uses the KeeLoq algorithm. The HCS301 KeeLoq system transmits 66 data bits. * 34 bits are not encrypted : a 28-bit serial number, 4 bits of button information, and 2 status bits (repeat and low battery indicators). * 32 bits are encrypted (the rolling code) : 4 bits of button information, 2 bits of OVR (used to extend counter value), 10 bits of DISC (discrimination value; often the low 10 bits of the serial number), and a 16-bit counter. In a resyncing situation, the encrypted 32 bits are replaced with a 32-bit seed value.  Rolljam vulnerability  A rolling code transmitted by radio signal that can be intercepted can be vulnerable to falsification. In 2015, it was reported that Samy Kamkar had built an inexpensive electronic device about the size of a wallet that could be concealed on or near a locked vehicle to capture a single keyless entry code to be used at a later time to unlock the vehicle. The device transmits a jamming signal to block the vehicle's reception of rolling code signals from the owner's fob, while recording these signals from both of his two attempts needed to unlock the vehicle. The recorded first code is forwarded to the vehicle only when the owner makes the second attempt, while the recorded second code is retained for future use. Kamkar stated that this vulnerability had been widely known for years to be present in many vehicle types, but was previously undemonstrated. A demonstration was done during DEF CON 23.

Preaching a hard-line and somewhat esoteric brand of loyalism, Tara enjoyed some influence in the late 1960s before declining amid a high-profile sex abuse scandal involving its leader William McGrath. Origins The roots of Tara lay in a group known as \\"The Cell\\". This shadowy group, headed by the evangelist William McGrath, was made up of a mixture of his youthful followers and senior Orangemen who met at 15 Wellington Park, McGrath's Malone Road, Belfast base for his mission.Chris Moore, The Kincora Scandal: Political Cover-Up and Intrigue in Northern Ireland, Marino Books, 1996, p. 34 Young men such as Fraser Agnew, Roy Garland and Clifford Smyth, became part of this growing but mainly clandestine group.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 34–38 The cell spearheaded a campaign of speeches to Protestant audiences, more political than religious in tone, encouraging unionists to turn away from the relatively moderate Terence O'Neill and to lend their support to his most vocal political opponent, the hardline Ian Paisley.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 38–39 Development In November 1966 McGrath reconstituted the Cell as Tara, choosing the name to reflect his belief in the Irish heritage of his politico-religious mission.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 46Martin Dillon, God and the Gun, Routledge, 1999, p. 235 It was intended as an outlet for virulent anti- Catholicism. The group endorsed British Israelism as it sometimes claimed that Ulster Protestants were descendants of the Lost tribe of Israel. The group espoused a form of historical revisionism, arguing that the early inhabitants of Ireland had come from modern Scotland before being displaced by the Irish, whilst also utilising Gaelic terms and symbols.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, 2002, p. 252 An Orange Order lodge attached to Tara and founded by McGrath was named \\"Ireland's Heritage\\" as a consequence of these views.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 23 Tara adopted as its motto \\"we hold Ulster that Ireland might be saved and Britain reborn\\".Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 47 As a movement Tara sought to establish a Protestant Northern Ireland in which law and order would be paramount and the Roman Catholic Church would be outlawed. Tara viewed Catholics as being in a grand conspiracy with moderate unionists and left-wing groups and felt that a conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism was inevitable. As a result members of Tara were expected to be proficient in weapon use and were encouraged to join the security forces. A short-lived alliance with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) was attempted and Roy Garland, a leading Orangeman in the 60s and 70s, and now an author, was one of Tara's members who worked closely with the UVF for a time.Review of Garland's 'Seeking a Political Accommodation – The Ulster Volunteer Force: Negotiating History' The leaders of the UVF initially encouraged their members to also become involved in Tara. With the UVF under the command of Samuel McClelland in the late 1960s, McGrath felt that an alliance with the better-armed group could help advance Tara's aims.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, p. 21 Tara enjoyed a rush of members around 1969 as McGrath's prophecy of a doomsday scenario in Northern Ireland looked like it might come true with the advent of the Troubles and a UVF bombing campaign, which McGrath suggested in a whispering campaign was the work of the Irish Army.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 61–64 Tara soon established their regular meeting place as Clifton Street Orange Hall, one of the most important centres of Belfast Orangeism, although McGrath did not openly tell the Orange Order leadership that he was using the rooms for Tara meetings, rather simply stating that he need them for generic meetings.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 71 A more formalised structure was adopted with Garland as deputy leader, Clifford Smyth as Intelligence Officer and leading roles for Frank Millar Jr and Protestant Telegraph journalist David Browne, whilst Davy Payne was also associate with the group, albeit at a lower level.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 73 Although initially Tara and the UVF co-operated closely, a number of people contacted McClelland to tell him that McGrath, who secretly pursued homosexual and pederastic relationships, was using the link-up with the UVF as a way to pick up young men who were members of the organisation. McClelland confronted McGrath who fiercely denied the allegations, but following a fiery argument the relationship between the UVF and Tara was ended and McClelland burnt the Tara ledger in which the names of his UVF men had been entered.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, pp. 95–96 From that point on the UVF proscribed Tara membership for its volunteers and sought to hamper the work of Tara.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 79 On a more practical level a number of UVF members who had become involved in Tara also informed their UVF superiors that Tara did not possess much in the way of weaponry or military know-how and according to Steve Bruce \\"Tara had a good line in martial rhetoric but even its claims to be ready for martial defence rang hollow\\". Bruce further adds that, for the most part, UVF members had simply used their attendance at Tara meetings as an opportunity to identify new recruits for their own group. Decline Tara failed to attract much interest as its ideas were too esoteric for most loyalists. By 1971 McGrath's relationship with his deputy Garland had deteriorated, as the two began to differ over ideology, whilst Garland had also been informed by some young members of Tara that McGrath had made passes at them.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 84–85 Garland broke from Tara soon afterwards and confirmed to the UVF that their suspicions about McGrath had been correct.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 117–118 A war of words erupted between the two groups, with McGrath and Tara regularly attacked in the pages of UVF magazine Combat and McGrath undertaking a letter- writing campaign to the press accusing the UVF of being a communist organisation.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 165 McGrath sought to boost the ailing movement by linking up with John McKeague, a member of the Free Presbyterian Church,Dillon, God and the Gun, p. 236 leading figure in the Shankill Defence Association and founder of the Red Hand Commando who allegedly shared McGrath's sexual attraction to men and children. The pair met at the Kincora Boys' Home, where McGrath took up a position in 1971, to discuss trading weapons for their respective groups.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 86 Around this time McGrath also made contact with another leading homosexual unionist, Sir Knox Cunningham, and secured funding for Tara from him. By 1974 Tara had an estimated 300–400 members, which was significantly less than the group had at their 1969 peak.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 118 In an attempt to inject some life into the group, which unlike the UVF, RHC and UDA was not active in shooting or bombing attacks, McGrath imported a quantity of rifles, machine guns and ammunition from hard-line Protestants in the Netherlands with whom he had close links.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, p. 121 The group continued to speak of a coming \\"doomsday\\" scenario in which they would have to take the lead in battling the Irish government and returning the island to its pre-Catholic roots, although beyond some drilling Tara undertook no real activity.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 120–125 According to Steve Bruce the group did little beyond releasing occasional threatening statements but was quickly superseded by the UVF/RHC and eventually also the UDA.Steve Bruce, Paisley: Religion and Politics in Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 217 The group spread rumours about senior unionist figures whom it felt were too moderate. A 1981 arms find damaged the group whilst McGrath had already been caught up in the Kincora scandal.The Kincora Scandal McGrath pleaded guilty to fifteen charges related to child sex abuse in December 1981 and was sentenced to four years imprisonment, representing the effective end of the by then near-moribund Tara.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 180–181 The name reappeared in 1986, when a leaflet denouncing the Anglo- Irish Agreement and predicting again the onset of the doomsday scenario was circulated, although this seems to have been the work of a handful of die- hards rather than a reorganised movement.Moore, The Kincora Scandal, pp. 215–220 ReferencesExternal links * Tara's 1973 declaration * CAIN entry on Tara Category:Anti-Catholicism in Northern Ireland Category:History of Northern Ireland Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Northern Ireland Category:1966 establishments in Northern Ireland ","title":"Tara (Northern Ireland)"},{"id":"4468224","text":"Eric Vanderaerden (born 11 February 1962) is a retired road cyclist from the town of Lummen, Belgium.

In subsequent years, he won two monument races: in 1985, at 23, he won the storm ridden edition of the Tour of Flanders, and in 1987 he won Paris–Roubaix. After 1988, his career went in decline and, despite his talent, he failed to win major races. He certainly had considerable talent as a time trial racer, but as a climber in the mountains his talent was limited. Perhaps, he was partly a victim of the high expectations the Belgian public had to get a successor for Eddy Merckx, a cyclist who was very versatile in winning both classic races and big stage races.citation needed After his active career, Vanderaerden has led a few semi-professional racing teams and was also assistant-manager of a professional Belgo-Italian team.

It was carried out by the National Army of the newly created Irish Free State against anti-treaty strongholds in the south and southwest of Ireland. At the beginning of the Civil War in June 1922, the Irish Free State government, composed of the leadership faction who had accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty, held the capital city of Dublin, where its armed forces were concentrated and some other areas of the midlands and north. The new National Army was composed of those units of the Irish Republican Army loyal to them, plus recent recruits, but was, at the start of the war, still relatively small and poorly armed.Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, The Irish Civil War, p127 Much of the rest of the country, particularly the south and west, was outside of its control and in the hands of the anti-Treaty elements of the IRA, who did not accept the legitimacy of the new state and who asserted that the Irish Republic, created in 1919, was the continuing legitimate all-island state. This situation was rapidly brought to an end in July and August 1922, when the commander-in-chief of the Free State forces, Michael Collins, launched the offensive. The offensive re-took the major towns for the Free State Government and marked the end of the conventional phase of the conflict. The offensive was followed by a 10-month period of guerrilla warfare until the republican side was defeated. Munster Republic The civil war started in Dublin, with a week of street fighting from 28 June to 5 July 1922 in which the Free State's forces secured the Irish capital from anti-Treaty IRA troops who had occupied several public buildings. With Dublin in pro-treaty hands, the conflict spread throughout the country, with anti-Treaty forces holding Cork, Limerick and Waterford as part of a self-styled independent \\"Munster Republic\\". They also held most of the west of Ireland. The Free State, on the other hand, after its taking of Dublin, controlled only of the eastern part of its territory. However, the Anti-Treaty side were not equipped to wage conventional war, lacking artillery and armoured units, both of which the Free State obtained from the British. This meant that Liam Lynch, the Chief of Staff of the Anti-Treaty IRA, hoped to act purely on the defensive, holding the \\"Munster Republic\\" long enough to prevent the foundation of the Free State and forcing the re-negotiation of the Treaty. Lynch's strategy was bitterly criticised by other anti-Treaty officers, such as Ernie O'Malley and Tom Barry. O'Malley felt that the republicans, who initially outnumbered the Government forces by roughly 12,000 fighters to 8,000The estimate is that of the Provisional Government in July 1922, Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p 127 (and who had the bulk of the experienced fighters from the preceding Irish War of Independence), should have seized the initiative, taken the major cities and presented the British with a resurrected Irish Republic as a fait accompli.O'Malley The Singing Flame pp. 140–141Meda Ryan, Tom Barry, IRA Freedom fighter p172-173 The thinking behind O'Malley's analysis was that time was on the side of the Free State as they could only get stronger, through supplies from the British, revenue raised from taxation and recruitment into their army, while the Republican side had only very limited means of re-supply of men, money or arms. O'Malley wrote: \\"Tan War experience would no longer suffice as this type of fighting would need semi-open warfare. Columns would have to be larger and their men trained to take the offensive in driving the enemy out of towns and cities... Unless our Connacht and Munster men moved on to Leinster effective opposition would be broken up piecemeal and we would soon be crushed\\". The leaders of the Free State government, Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy, also felt that a rapid victory was essential from their point of view. To secure the withdrawal of British troops from Ireland (Collins' ultimate aim) the government would have to demonstrate its viability by suppressing what, from its point of view, was an illegal insurrection and its control all of its sovereign territory. It was with this aim in mind that they launched their offensive in July–August 1922 to re-take the south and west of the country.Peter Hart, Mick, The Real Michael Collins, pp. 399–401 Fall of Limerick  Troops in Limerick during July 1922 In Limerick, the outbreak of the war saw the city already occupied by both pro and anti-treaty factions. The anti-treaty IRA, largely composed of Liam Forde's Mid-Limerick Brigade and commanded by Liam Lynch, held four military barracks and most of the town. The Free State forces in the city consisted of the pro-Treaty First Western Division of the IRA under Michael Brennan and the Fourth Southern Division under Commandant General Donochadh O'Hannigan. They held the Customs House, the Jail, the Courthouse, Williams Street RIC Barracks, and Cruises Hotel. They also held the Athlunkard bridge located outside of Limerick which provided a secure means of bringing reinforcements.Corbett, Jim Not While I have Ammo, The History of Connie Mackey, Defender of the Strand, Nonsuch, Dublin 2008, p72 Fighting broke out between them on 11 July 1922, when the first Free State reinforcements arrived from Dublin. At 7 p.m. on 11 July, the National Army opened fire on the Republican garrison holding the Ordnance Barracks. Liam Lynch left Limerick when the fighting broke out and transferred his headquarters to Clonmel. On 17 July, General Eoin O'Duffy arrived with 150 Free State reinforcements including a Whippet Rolls Royce armoured car, 2 Lancia armoured cars, 4 trucks with 400 rifles, 10 Lewis machine guns, 400 grenades, ammunition and an 18-pounder cannon. The 18-pounder field gun was used on 19 July to batter the Strand Barracks, which was under the command of captain Connie McNamara, into surrender.Corbett, p93 After three days of street fighting, after midnight on 21 July, the Republicans set the Artillery (also called the ordnance barracks), castle barracks and New Barracks on fire and evacuated Limerick city. Despite the intensive street fighting in Limerick, the casualties of the combatants were relatively light; 19 bodies were left in the city morgue, twelve of whom were civilians and seven Free State soldiers. Another 87 were wounded. The Republican dead were reported in the press as thirty killed but they admitted only five. Limerick Prison, designed to hold 120 people, contained 800 prisoners by November.Corbett, Not While I have Ammo, p99, , Also Pardarig Óg O Ruairc The Battle for Limerick City, p140-141 Following the fall of Limerick the anti treaty forces retreated through Patrickswell towards Kilmallock. There, in the Kilmallock-Bruff-Bruree triangle, would be seen some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Free State troops take Waterford Soldiers at Granville Hotel, Waterford during July 1922 Republicans considered Waterford to be the eastern strongpoint of the Munster Republic; however, it too was taken by a Free State column equipped with armour and artillery between 18 July and 20 July. The city was held by the IRA Waterford Brigade, and a unit from Cork city under the overall commandant of Colonel Commandant Pax Whelan and flying column leader George Lennon; a total of nearly 300 men.Terence O'Reilly, Rebel Heart: George Lennon: Flying Column Commander Mercier 2009, , p175-188 In late July 1922, National Army troops under Major General John T. Prout and former East Waterford I.R. A. Commandant Paddy Paul, composed of 450 men, one 18-pounder artillery piece and 4 machine guns arrived from Kilkenny to retake the city. The republicans had chosen to defend the city along the southern bank of the river Suir, occupying the military barracks, the prison and the Post Office. Prout placed his artillery on Mount Misery hill overlooking their positions and bombarded the Republicans until they were forced to evacuate the barracks and prison. However, the gun had to be brought down to Ferrybank (along the river) to fire over open sights before the Republicans abandoned the Post Office. Six more shells were fired at Ballybricken prison before it was also evacuated. Some street fighting followed before the Republicans abandoned the city and retreated westwards. Two Free State soldiers were killed in the fighting and one Republican. Five civilians were also killed. A proposed Republican counterattack from Carrick on Suir failed to materialise. The Free State forces under Prout went on to take Tipperary on 2 August, Carrick on Suir on 3 August and Clonmel on 10 August, effectively clearing the south midlands of Republican held positions. In taking these towns, Free State troops generally encountered only limited resistance. The Republicans, when faced with artillery, tended to retreat and burn barracks they were holding rather than try to hold them and risk heavy casualties.Hopkinson, Green Against Green p129 At both Limerick and Waterford, the Free State's advantage in weaponry, particularly artillery, was decisive. Casualties on both sides in these actions were relatively light, although there were also some civilian casualties, since the fighting took place in the heavily populated urban centres. Combat at Killmallock The Free State troops under Eoin O'Duffy encountered more tenacious resistance in the countryside around Kilmallock, south of Limerick city, when they tried to advance into republican held Munster. Eoin O'Duffy's 1,500 troops were faced with about 2,000 anti-Treaty IRA men under Liam Deasy, who had three armoured cars they had taken from the evacuating British troops. Deasy's men were dug in at Kilmallock, Bruree to the northwest and Bruff to the northeast. On 23 July Major General W.R.E. Murphy (a former British Army officer and O'Duffy's second in command) took the town of Bruff, but his poorly motivated troops lost it again the following day and 76 of them surrendered to the Republicans.Hopkinson, Green Against Green p152 The Free State troops re-took Bruff shortly afterwards, though and on 30 July, they assaulted Bruree with their best troops – the Dublin Guard. They took it after a five-hour fight, but only after artillery was brought up at close range to support them. Liam Deasy attempted to re-take the village on 2 August, but the attack, with three armoured cars, was beaten off.Paul V. Walsh, 'The Irish Civil War 1922–1923: A Military Study of the Conventional Phase 28 June – 11 August 1922. The following day, 2,000 Free State troops advanced on Kilmallock. Fighting continued here until 5 August, despite the arrival of over 1,000 more Free State troops and more armoured cars and artillery. Deasy's anti-treaty forces were ultimately forced to retreat however, when Free State forces were landed by sea behind them in Passage West and Fenit in counties Cork and Kerry on 2 August and 8 August respectively. When the National Army entered Kilmallock on 5 August, they found only a Republican rearguard, the remainder having already retreated in the direction of Charleville. There was final rearguard action at Newcastlewest before the republican forces retreated after losing a number of men (press reports suggested 12) killed.Michael Harrington, The Munster Republic, The Civil War in North Cork, p 72 Fall of Cork and landing in the west Arvonia, formerly Cambria Free State armoured car at Passage West, c.August 1922 The Free State's forces took the south and west of Ireland with landings from the sea. Seaborne landings were the first proposed by Emmet Dalton and then adopted by Michael Collins. Their plan was to avoid the hard fighting that would inevitably occur if they advanced overland through Republican held Munster and Connaught. To this end, they commandeered several civilian passenger ships to transport troops. They were the Arvonia and the SS Lady Wicklow They were escorted by British naval vesselsPaul V. Walsh, The Irish Civil War 1922–1923: A Military Study of the Conventional Phase 28 June – 11 August 1922. Appendix M The first naval landing took place at Clew Bay in County Mayo on 24 July and helped re-take the west of Ireland for the Free State. This force, consisting of 400 Free State soldiers, one field gun and an armoured car under Christopher O'Malley, re-took the Republican held town of Westport and linked up with another Free State column under Sean MacEoin advancing from Castlebar. A Free State column also dispersed anti-Treaty IRA forces in Donegal in Ireland's north-west.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p160-161 The largest seaborne landings took place in the south. Ships disembarked about 2,000 well equipped Free State troops into the heart of the \\"Munster Republic\\" and caused the rapid collapse of the Republican position in this province. Paddy Daly and the Dublin Guard landed at Fenit in County Kerry on 2 August and fought their way into Tralee at the cost of 9 killed and 35 wounded. They were reinforced on 3 August, by around 250 pro-treaty IRA men from County Clare, embarked from Kilrush to Tarbert in fishing boats. The Free State forces rapidly occupied the towns in the county but the Republican units in Kerry survived more or less intact and would fight a determined guerrilla campaign for the remainder of the war.Niall Harrington, Kerry Landing August 1922, p130-131 If the Munster Republic had a capital, it was Cork and the largest seaborne landings of the civil war were aimed at taking that city. Emmet Dalton led 800 troops, with two artillery pieces and armoured cars, who landed at Passage West, near the city, on 8 August. A further 200 men were put ashore at Youghal and 180 troops landed at Glandore.Walsh, The Irish Civil War a Study of the Conventional Phase There was some heavy fighting at Rochestown and Douglas in which at least ten Free State and 7 Republican fighters were killed and at least 60 men on both sides were wounded,John Borgonovo, The Battle for Cork, p108-109 before the outnumbered and outgunned anti-treaty IRA retreated into the city. However, they did not try to continue the fighting Cork itself, partly in order to spare the civilian population, but instead burned Charles Barracks, near Kinsale, which they had been occupying, and dispersed into the countryside.Borgonovo, p 112 Republican prisoners are marched towards Cork Gaol in August 1922 The Free State landings in Munster coincided with an attempt by anti-Treaty guerrillas to isolate Dublin by destroying all the road and rail bridges leading into the city. However this operation was a complete failure with over 180 republicans being captured at a cost of only two Free State soldiers wounded.The Irish Story - The Bridges Job On 10 August, Free State troops entered Cork city unopposed, the last city to fall in the \\"Munster Republic\\". Liam Lynch, the Republican commander in chief abandoned Fermoy, the last Republican held town, the following day. In leaving Fermoy, he issued an order to troops under his command to stop trying to hold fixed positions and to form flying columns to pursue guerrilla warfare.Michael Harrington, The Munster Republic, p77 Aftermath The Free State offensive of July–August 1922 all but ended the Anti-Treaty side's chances of winning the war. The Republicans failed, with the exception of a brief stand around Killmallock, to resist the advance of Free State troops anywhere in the country. While some of this can be put down to the Free State's advantages in arms and equipment, the Republican leadership under Liam Lynch also failed to devise any coherent military strategy, allowing their positions to be picked off one by one. On top of this, most of the Republican fighters showed little appetite for the civil war, generally retreating before National Army attacks rather than putting up determined resistance. In part, this shows a lack of discipline and training for conventional warfare, but there was also a general reluctance on both sides to fight against former comrades from the War of Independence. One, for instance Tom Maguire said that, 'in the beginning our men would not kill the [Free] Staters', while another George Gilmore said, 'I had not a desire to kill the enemy, all of our man had it [reluctance] to some extent and the officers who were operating against us were our own former friends'.Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p128-130 The Free State Government's victories in the major towns inaugurated a period of inconclusive guerrilla warfare. Anti-Treaty IRA units held out in areas such as the western part of counties Cork and Kerry in the south, county Wexford in the east and counties Sligo and Mayo in the west. Sporadic fighting also took place around Dundalk, where Frank Aiken and the Fourth Northern Division of the Irish Republican Army were based. Aiken originally wanted to stay neutral, but was arrested by Free State troops along with 400 of his men on 16 July 1922. They subsequently broke out of prison in Dundalk and temporarily re-took the town in a guerrilla raid.The Irish Story The anti-Treaty IRA Attack on Dundalk Nowhere, however, did the Republicans manage to re-take any territory lost on the first two months of fighting. Moreover, with the exception of county Kerry and a few other localities, the anti-treaty guerrilla campaign failed to gather momentum and by 1923, was largely reduced to small scale attacks and acts of sabotage. It took eight months of intermittent guerrilla warfare after the fall of Cork before the war was brought to an end, with victory for the Free State government. In April 1923, Liam Lynch was killed. His successor as anti-Treaty commander, Frank Aiken, called a ceasefire on 30 April and a month later, ordered his men to \\"dump arms\\" and go home. The intervening period was marked by the death of leaders formerly allied in the cause of Irish independence. Commander-in-Chief Michael Collins was killed in an ambush by anti-treaty republicans at Béal na mBláth, near his home in County Cork, on 22 August 1922. Arthur Griffith, the Free State president died of a brain haemorrhage ten days before. The Free State government was subsequently led by William Cosgrave and the Free State Army by General Richard Mulcahy. On the Republican side, leaders such as Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Joe McKelvey, Erskine Childers and Liam Lynch lost their lives in the guerrilla phase of the war. This phase of the war, much more than the conventional phase, developed into a vicious cycle of revenge killings and reprisals as the Republicans assassinated pro-treaty politicians and the Free State responded with the execution of Republican prisoners.

Nicolas Chédeville (20 February 1705 – 6 August 1782) was a French composer, musette player and musette maker. Biography Nicolas Chédeville was born in Serez, Normandy; musicians Pierre Chédeville (1694–1725) and Esprit Philippe Chédeville (1696–1762) were his brothers. Louis Hotteterre was his great uncle and godfather, and may have given him instruction in music and turning instruments. He began playing the oboe and musette (a bagpipe-like instrument commonly used in French baroque music) in the Paris Opera orchestra in the 1720s. After Jean Hotteterre's death in 1732, he took over his post in Les Grands Hautbois, the royal oboe band. He retired from the opera in July 1748, though returned occasionally to play the musette there. When he was nearly 70, he married the younger daughter of a valet who had once worked for the Duc d'Orléans, and was still describing himself as musette player to the king. In his last years he experienced financial difficulties. His ten houses were signed over to creditors in 1774, following which he separated from his wife. He resigned from Les Grands Hautbois in 1777, petitioned for bankruptcy in 1778 and died in Paris four years later. Lawyers were still trying to settle his affairs in 1790. Jean- Benjamin de la Borde called him \\"the most celebrated musette player France had ever had\\", though he mistakenly held the opinion that he was dead by 1780, two years before he met his end. He taught the musette to Princess Victoire from about 1750, and became a popular teacher among the aristocracy, eventually attaining the title of maître de musette de Mesdames de France. He was also a musette maker, and extended the instrument's compass in the bass down to c' (middle C). Works Chédeville's compositions were intended for the amusement and pleasure of wealthy amateur musicians; the French aristocracy of the time found pleasure in playing rustic instruments while living a romantic fantasy of peasant life (before the French revolution presented a rather different perspective). His first published works were collections of pieces for musette or hurdy-gurdy, entitled Amusements champêtres (pastoral amusements), published in December 1729. He called himself 'Chedeville le jeune', and in later compositions referred to himself as 'Chedeville le cadet'. Another collection of Amusements champêtres followed, which were of a more advanced technical and musical substance. Some variety was found in op. 6, with pieces named after battles and expressing 'war-like images'; it was inspired by a military campaign he had gone on with the Prince of Conti. He turned briefly to more serious music with Italian influences in op. 7, which is his only collection written specifically for the flute, oboe or violin. Impersonation of Vivaldi In 1737 he made a secret agreement with Jean- Noël Marchand to publish a collection of his own compositions as Antonio Vivaldi's op. 13, entitled Il pastor fido. Chédeville supplied the money and received the profits, all of which was attested to in a notarial act by Marchand in 1749. This may have been an attempt to give his instrument, the musette, the endorsement of a great composer which it lacked. His interest in Italian music led to his receiving, in August 1739, a privilege to publish arrangements for the musette, hurdy-gurdy or flute of concertos and sonatas by ten specific Italian composers, in addition to Johann Joachim Quantz and Antoine Mahaut. Le printems, ou Les saisons amusantes (1739) is a particularly amusing result of this privilege; it is an arrangement of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons for hurdy-gurdy or musette, violin, and flute (though the French flute could also mean the recorder). He replaced Vivaldi's original Summer with his op. 8 no. 9 concerto, transferred the middle movement of Winter to Autumn, and replaced Winter op. 8 no. 12. All this was quite freely arranged and combined with some added Vivaldian material by Chédeville. Compositions Published in Paris. All solo works are accompanied by continuo.

Byrd in the United States Senate. He received a B.A. (cum laude) in political science from Cornell University in 1964; two M.A. degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1967; and a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1980. He was subsequently admitted to the Maryland and Washington, D.C. bars. A member of the Democratic Party, D'Amato was the chief (1988-1995) and minority (1995-1998) counsel for the Senate Appropriations Committee. Working under Byrd (the Committee's longtime chairman and ranking member), he coordinated and managed the annual appropriations bills and other legislation on policy and funding of U.S. international operations and programs, including trade, defense and the full range of foreign activities of the U.S. government. In this role, D'Amato allegedly investigated the funding structure of a purported \\"black budget\\" (and potentially extra-governmental) Unacknowledged Special Access Program tasked with studying UFO phenomena, possibly encompassing \\"crash retrieval\\" artifacts stemming from the Roswell UFO incident and analogous events. According to researcher Timothy Good, D'Amato \\"amassed a great deal of hearsay evidence [...] but was never able to gain access to the most sensitive information being withheld in the military and intelligence communities.\\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Need_to_Know/5_dpvU4IgXwC?hl=en In the course of his research, D'Amato liaised with a litany of prominent figures in ufology, including venture capitalist Jacques Vallée (as recounted by Vallée in his diaries)https://www.google.com/books/edition/Forbidden_Science_4/gd_9wwEACAAJ?hl=en and alleged \\"experiencer\\" Whitley Strieber. However, circa 2013, D'Amato issued a statement about the UFO inquiry on his now-defunct website in which he asserted: \\"[A] senior Senate Committee chairman asked me to conduct a preliminary inquiry into allegations that came to his attention regarding unidentified aerial crashes in the 1940s in New Mexico. I met with a number of people who had made public statements on the matter. I reported my conclusion to the Senator that the basis for such allegations did not appear to merit any further Senate investigation. Beyond this inquiry on behalf of the Senator, I have no personal opinion on the matter and consider the inquiry to have been closed for over 20 years.\\" While serving as chief counsel to the Appropriations Committee, D'Amato also played an integral role in funding the Stargate Project, the Defense Intelligence Agency's remote viewing research program, until its dissolution in 1995. According to Paul Smith, D'Amato was in a romantic relationship with \\"Robin,\\" a remote viewer and former DIA Freedom of Information Office administrative assistant employed by the program, although it is unclear if their involvement prompted his support. Smith has postulated that \\"Robin\\" (who objected to military oversight of the research) enjoined D'Amato to \\"[grease] the wheels\\" in facilitating its transfer to the Central Intelligence Agency, which soon elected to terminate the program.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Reading_the_Enemy_s_Mind/oGObB8OsPqYC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=d%27amato D'Amato also served as senior foreign policy counsel for Byrd. In this capacity, he drafted the resolution that set Senate standards for international global climate change treaty negotiations. He worked on a wide array of issues affecting U.S. international economic and political interests, such as World Trade Organization review legislation and burden-sharing agreements during the Gulf War. Between 1980 and 1987, D'Amato was Byrd's director of political, economic, and national security policy during his tenure as Senate majority leader. He joined the congressional staff as legislative director for then-Representative Jim Jeffords (1975-1978) before serving as legislative assistant and then chief of staff to Senator Abraham Ribicoff (1978-1980). Throughout his political career, D'Amato served in the United States Navy Reserve, attaining the rank of captain.

There are 350-year-old Beaucarneas registered in Mexico.Instituto de Ecología A.C. video files, Mexico Description Elephant's foot palm tree trunk in Artemisa Province, Cuba It is an evergreen perennial growing to with a noticeable expanded caudex, for storing water. The single palm-like stem produces terminal tufts of strap- shaped, recurved leathery leaves, sometimes hair lock-shaped in the ends, and with occasional panicles of small white flowers once the plant reaches over 10 years of age. The only moderately swollen trunk at the base is slender over it and only slightly branched. The almost spherical caudex in the youth stage later becomes 4 to 6 meters long? and reaches a diameter of up to 50 centimeters and more at the base. The bark is smooth. The green lineal, slightly rejuvenated and bent leaves are thin, flat or slightly ridged. They are 90 to 180 inches long and 15 to 20 millimeters wide. Habitat Its habitat is low deciduous forest, whose average temperatures of 20 °C and an annual rainfall of 800 mm, and a well-marked dry season of between 7 and 8 month. This type of forests are in an altitudinal range of 0 to 1700 meters above sea level. They grow on rocky soils deficient in nutrients, cliffs and steep mountains. The plant is resistant up to 10 °C, and grows in full sun or partial shade. The plants are very slow growing and very tolerant to drought, in a pot or planted as an ornamental garden tree.Miranda, F. and Hernández XE 1963. The vegetation types of Mexico and their classification. Bol. Soc. Bot. Mex. 28: 29-72. Cultivation Having gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. B. recurvata is often grown as a houseplant or an outdoor plant in temperate climate gardens. Slow-growing and drought- tolerant, Beaucarnea recurvata is hardy to , grows in full sun to light shade, and requires proper soil mix to drain when watered. However, be cautious not to over-water, as this will foster pests like the mealybug and cochineal insect. If going to be kept in places with strong winters, it must be an indoor plant as it cannot resist cold temperatures. To maintain its original shape, the ends of its leaves should not be snipped, and when repotted it must keep all of its roots.Nason, J, and JL Hamrick. 1997.

This allows measurement of the current in a conductor without the need to make physical contact with it, or to disconnect it for insertion through the probe. Current clamps are typically used to read the magnitude of alternating current (AC) and, with additional instrumentation, the phase and waveform can also be measured. Some clamp meters can measure currents of 1000 A and more. Hall effect and vane type clamps can also measure direct current (DC). Types of current clamp=Current transformer A common form of current clamp comprises a split ring made of ferrite or soft iron. A wire coil is wound round one or both halves, forming one winding of a current transformer. The conductor it is clamped around forms the other winding. Like any transformer this type works only with AC or pulse waveforms, with some examples extending into the megahertz range. When measuring current, the subject conductor forms the primary winding and the coil forms the secondary. This type may also be used in reverse, to inject current into the conductor, for example in electromagnetic compatibility susceptibility testing to induce an interference current. Usually, the injection probe is specifically designed for this purpose. In this mode, the coil forms the primary and the test conductor the secondary. Iron vane In the iron vane type, the magnetic flux in the core directly affects a moving iron vane, allowing both AC and DC to be measured, and gives a true root mean square (RMS) value for non-sinusoidal AC waveforms. Due to its physical size it is generally limited to power transmission frequencies up to around 100 Hz. The vane is usually fixed directly to the display mechanism of an analogue (moving pointer) clamp meter. The calibration of the instrument is clearly non-linear. Hall effect The Hall effect type is more sensitive and is able to measure both DC and AC, in some examples up to the kilohertz (thousands of hertz) range. This type was often used with oscilloscopes, and with high-end computerized digital multimeters, however, they are becoming common place for more general use. Rogowski coil Resembling a current clamp in appearance and function is the Rogowski coil current sensor. This coreless transformer is used in clamp meters and power monitoring loggers. It has the advantage of better linearity, having no core to saturate, it can be made flexible, and does not require any magnetic or electrical contact at the opening end. The Rogowski coil gives a voltage proportional to the rate of change of current in the primary cable, so more signal processing is needed before the sensed values can be displayed. Clamp meter A digital clamp meterA multimeter with built-in clamp. Pushing the large button at the bottom opens the lower jaw of the clamp, allowing the clamp to be placed around a conductor. An electrical meter with integral AC current clamp is known as a clamp meter, clamp-on ammeter, tong tester, or colloquially as an amp clamp. A clamp meter measures the vector sum of the currents flowing in all the conductors passing through the probe, which depends on the phase relationship of the currents. Only one conductor is normally passed through the probe. In particular if the clamp is closed around a two-conductor cable carrying power to equipment, the same current flows down one conductor and up the other; the meter correctly reads a net current of zero. As electrical cables for equipment have both insulated conductors (and possibly an earth wire) bonded together, clamp meters are often used with what is essentially a short extension cord with the two conductors separated, so that the clamp can be placed around only one conductor of this extension. A relatively recent development is a multi-conductor clamp meter with several sensor coils around the jaws of the clamp. This could be clamped around standard two- or three-conductor single-phase cables to provide a readout of the current flowing through the load,Megger MMC850 clamp meter specification. Designed to read current even if both conductors enclosed. with no need to separate the conductors. The reading produced by a conductor carrying a very low current can be increased by winding the conductor around the clamp several times; the meter reading divided by the number of turns is the current, with some loss of accuracy due to inductive effects. Clamp meters are used by electricians, sometimes with the clamp incorporated into a general purpose multimeter. It is simple to measure very high currents (hundreds of amperes) with the appropriate current transformer. Accurate measurement of low currents (a few milliamperes) with a current transformer clamp is more difficult. The range of any given meter can be extended by passing the conductor through the jaw multiple times. For example a 0–200 A meter can be turned into a 0–20 A meter by winding the conductor 10 times around the jaw's core. Columbia iron vane type clamp-on ammeter, with heads for different ranges Less-expensive clamp meters use a rectifier circuit which actually reads mean current, but is calibrated to display the RMS current corresponding to the measured mean, giving a correct RMS reading only if the current is a sine wave. For other waveforms readings will be incorrect; when these simpler meters are used with non-sinusoidal loads such as the ballasts used with fluorescent lamps or high- intensity discharge lamps or most modern computer and electronic equipment, readings can be quite inaccurate. Meters which respond to true RMS rather than mean current are described as \\"true RMS\\". Typical hand-held Hall effect units can read currents as low as 200 mA, and units that can read down to 1 mA are available. The Columbia tong test ammeter (illustrated) is an example of the iron vane type, used for measuring large AC currents up to 1000 amperes. The iron jaws of the meter direct the magnetic field surrounding the conductor to an iron vane that is attached to the needle of the meter. The iron vane moves in proportion to the strength of the magnetic field, and thus produces a meter indication proportional to the current. This type of ammeter can measure both AC and DC currents and provides a true RMS current measurement of non- sinusoidal or distorted AC waveforms. Interchangeable meter movements can be installed in the clamping assembly to provide various full-scale current values up to 1000 amperes. The iron vane is in a small cylinder that is inserted in a space at the hinged end of the clamp-on jaws. Several jaw sizes are available for clamping around large conductors and bus bars up to wide. As the illustration shows, the scale is very non-linear and unsuitable for measuring low currents, with currents of less than half the full-scale deflection crammed into a short section of the dial. Power meter, energy analyzer Clamp probes are used with some meters to measure electrical power and energy. The clamp measures the current and other circuitry the voltage; the true power is the product of the instantaneous voltage and current integrated over a cycle. Comprehensive meters designed to measure many parameters of electrical energy (power factor, distortion, instantaneous power as a function of time, phase relationships, etc.), use this principle. A single clamp is used for single-phase measurements; with an appropriate instrument with three clamps, measurements may be made on three-phase power systems.

History The cathedral was built to replace St. John's Church, which had become too small for Calcutta's growing European community; by 1810 there were 4,000 British men and 300 British women in Bengal. In 1819, at the request of Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings then Governor-General of Bengal Royal Engineers officer William Nairn Forbes produced a design for the proposed cathedral; however, it was not accepted as it was deemed too expensive to build. Bishop Middleton suggested as a site for the new cathedral the part of the city now known as \\"Fives Court\\", where the cathedral now stands. In 1762 the area had been described as a forest so wild that it harbored tigers and at first it was regarded as \\"too far south\\" to serve as a location for the cathedral. Middleton died in 1822 before building plans took shape. The next three bishops Reginald Heber, Thomas James and John Turner all died after brief tenures, and it was not until 1832, under Bishop Daniel Wilson, that the project to build the cathedral was revived. Following acquisition of of land to build the cathedral, a Cathedral Committee was set up to build it. The military engineer, Major William Nairn Forbes (17961855) (who later became a Major- General in the Bengal Engineers), at the request of Bishop Wilson, designed the cathedral with the assistance of architect C. K. Robinson, modelling the tower and spire on Norwich Cathedral. On 8October 1839, construction was initiated by laying the cornerstone. The cathedral was completed after eight years and consecrated on 8October 1847. The consecration ceremony, to mark which Queen Victoria had sent \\"ten pieces of silver-gilt plate\\" for the cathedral, was largely attended by Europeans and local people. The cathedral was built in Gothic revival style, but with modern construction elements, including an iron framework. It was built with a chancel, a sanctuary, chapels and a tall spire; the cost of construction of the edifice was then Rs.4,35,669. The cathedral can accommodate 800 to 1,000 people. In the 1897 earthquake the cathedral suffered damage and was refurbished. In the subsequent massive earthquake of 1934, when Calcutta was devastated, the cathedral's steeple tower collapsed. It was reconstructed to a revised design. Following the 1934 Calcutta earthquake, the tower was rebuilt along the lines of the central Bell Harry tower of Canterbury Cathedral. On its completion, St.Paul's replaced St.John's Church as the cathedral. The cathedral also has a statue of Bishop Heber (17831826), Second Bishop of Calcutta; the statue was sculpted by Francis Leggatt Chantrey. The Bishop's House across the street is also architecturally notable. The cathedral is well maintained in a serene and peaceful atmosphere. People of all religious denominations can visit the church. Service is held regularly. Christmas is a special occasion when a large number of people assemble to participate in the festivities. Features St. Paul's church replaced St. John's Church, Kolkata (shown above) as the cathedral St. Paul's Cathedral, north façade The Imperial Gazetteer defined the architectural design of the cathedral as \\"Indo-Gothic\\", to mean a Gothic architectural style built to meet the climatic conditions of India. It was also called a \\"spurious gothic adapted to the exigencies of the Indian climate.\\" The cathedral's design, otherwise known as Gothic Revival style, includes three stained-glass windows and two frescoes in the Florentine Renaissance style; the West Window was created by Morris & Co. to a design by Sir Edward Burne-Jones. The nave of the cathedral is very long at , and its width is . The nave is fitted with well-crafted wooden pews and chairs. The central spire rises to a height of , and the tower on which it stands is square in shape and was patterned on the lines of the 12th-century Canterbury Cathedral, England. The tower was fitted with five clocks, each of which weighed about three tons. The stained-glass windows on the western side were the creation of Sir Edward Burne-Jones, a pre-Raphaelite master, which were fitted in half-sunk arches; these were designed in 1880 in memory of Lord Mayo who was assassinated in the Andaman Islands. When completed in 1847, the cathedral as a whole was compared to Norwich Cathedral in England. The East window, which had original stained glass, was destroyed by a cyclone in 1964. It was replaced with a new one in 1968. The roof of the cathedral (it was the largest span when built) is in the shape of a shallow curve arching over iron trusses decorated with Gothic tracery. The nave of the cathedral is built spaciously without any aisles on its flanks. The materials used in the construction of the cathedral consisted of special bricks, light in weight and with good compression strength. The ashlars used were of Chunar stone. The external and internal surfaces of the cathedral were plastered with fine chunam (lime plaster) in the form of stucco. The cathedral's interior has a display of many plastic art forms and memorabilia. There is an episcopal throne on the southern flank of the altar and a reredos or decorative wall on its liturgical east end dated to 1879; it has carvings of episodes related to the life of St.Paul, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Flight into Egypt, all the work of Sir Arthur Blomfield. The parish hall within the premises of the cathedral is the venue for holding social functions. The eastern wall in the cathedral has paintings of the life of St.Paul, painted by Blomfield in 1886. Also notable is the font, with its sculpture of Bishop Heber in a kneeling posture. The cathedral's organ, with 41 stops, made by Henry Willis and Sons of London, is still in use. The cathedral complex also has a library, situated over the western porch, to dimensions of with a height of . It was built at the initiative of Bishop Wilson, who donated 8,000 of his books and manuscripts. Further donations of books to the library were from W.Gordon and Rev.J.Nath of the University of Oxford and the Calcutta Bible Society. The library also has a sculpture of Bishop Wilson made in marble. Entry to the cathedral is from the north through a large gate made of wrought iron called the Sir William Prentice Memorial Gate, which is named after Sir William Prentice, who was a member of cathedral's congregation for many years. The cathedral is surrounded by a well-tended garden. In 1847, 63 species of trees had been planted in this garden. Burials Bishop Daniel Wilson, who had requested burial in the cathedral and also that memorial tablets be placed at St.Pauls' Cathedral, in Bishop's College Chapel at Calcutta, and in the St Mary's Church, Islington, lies in an underground chamber of the cathedral, where a plaque conferred on him by Queen Victoria is also on display. Sir John Paxton Norman, an acting Chief Justice who was assassinated, is memorialized by a large, decorated plaque, surmounted by a cross, with an engraving depicting Justice with her scales against a background of tilework flowers evoking Judge Norman's interest in botany. Arthur William Garnett, an English engineer who died in India in 1861, was buried here.

It is located in the town of Rotterdam, New York, in the hamlet of Rotterdam Junction, New York, along New York State Highway 5S, about west of the city of Schenectady. The property includes the original 1705 stone Mabee House, a 1760s brick house, a 1790s inn, a family cemetery and more, sits alongside the banks of the Mohawk River and was donated to the Schenectady County Historical Society on January 29, 1993. An H-bent frame Dutch barn, dating from the 1760s, was acquired from the Nilsen family in 1997, moved from Johnstown, N.Y., restored, and re-installed at the Mabee Farm Historic Site. Various educational programs and events are now offered to the public there. In 2007, 27 acres were purchased from a neighboring property and are now the location of the George E. Franchere Education Center, which opened in 2011. History The property was first acquired by Daniel Janse Van Antwerpen in 1671. He purchased the property from the Mohawks and received a grant for the patent in 1680 from the English Governor Edmund Andros. Van Antwerpen, a friend, mentor, and neighbor of Jan Pieterse Mabee and wife Anna Borsboom in the Schenectady's Stockade Historic District, sold the westerly half of the farm property to Jan in 1705/6. The original deed was given to the Schenectady County Historical Society along with 582 other documents and over 1,000 artifacts. The original structures on the farm are the stone house, a frame pre-Erie Canal inn, in which Revolutionary War General Philip Schuyler stayed in 1792 while surveying for the Western Inland Navigation and Lock Company, and the half brick house. The farm's original barns, however, were consumed by fire in the 1870s and 1970s. There is also a family cemetery, which has 21 headstones dating from 1771, and a marker honoring the enslaved people owned by the Mabee family, who lived, worked, and died at the site. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs George Franchere, the last descendant of that particular Mabee line to own the House and property, donated the site to the Schenectady County Historical Society in 1993, with the intention that it would be maintained as a museum and educational center. To that end, numerous family members, staff, and volunteers have worked to preserve the property and its donated artifacts, and to develop educational programs and events that present the history of the family, farming, Schenectady County and the Mohawk Valley to visitors. Operation as a Historic Site The Jan Mabee and Anna Borsboom House, Brick building, and Inn, on the of property in Rotterdam Junction, NY were given to the Schenectady County Historical Society by George E. Franchere in 1993, 11 years before he died. In 1996, the Historical Society applied for a matching-funds grant to restore the house, but the grant was denied; the members instead planned a private fundraising campaign. In addition to the west part of the House, which dendrochronology done at Cornell University dates to approximately 1705, making it the oldest known unaltered structure standing in the Mohawk Valley, the site now contains the 1760s Nilsen Dutch Barn, a smaller English barn, and several small outbuildings. In 2007 the Historical Society acquired of property adjacent to the site from Schenectady County to construct the George Eugene Franchere Education Center, a three-level structure which, completed in 2011, now allows the site to operate year-round. The Franchere Center provides space for rotating history and art exhibits, a 150-seat lecture hall, a conference room, gift shop, and also artifact storage, offices for staff, and work space for interns and volunteers. The building also features geothermal pumps which are powered by the solar panels atop the picnic pavilion. Additionally, in 2009 the Historical Society acquired 9 acres from NY State Canal Corporation across (north side) the Mohawk river, to protect its historic viewshed. The site borders the south side of Mohawk River (now also the New York State Barge Canal), and the Farm's dock serves as the home base for two bateaux, the De Sager and the Bobbie G, specially constructed by the Alplaus Maritime Academy for the Mabee Farm. The Onrust was built here from 2006 to 2009 in time for the Quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's voyage to what became New Netherland. The Mabee Farm Historic Site is open year-round to visitors for guided tours through the historic structures, and/or for self-guided visits through the exhibits on display in the Franchere Center. The site welcomes over 15,000 annually. References 2\\\\.

Summary On July 14, 2000 at approximately 7 PM, an F3 tornado tore through the Green Acres Campground at Pine Lake in central Alberta, killing 12 people and critically injuring more than 100 others. Pine Lake is a recreational area approximately southeast of Red Deer, Alberta and northeast of the city of Calgary. The tornado formed out of a severe thunderstorm which formed on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies and moved rapidly eastward, encountering a narrow band of low-level moisture that caused it to develop into a supercell thunderstorm. It touched down about west of the campground and was on the ground for approximately . Damage occurred in a swath wide. The heaviest damage occurred in a central corridor. Damage assessment suggests that winds within the central corridor reached . In addition, Weather Watchers reported hail as large as baseballs. An average of 16 tornadoes occur in Alberta every year, and an average of 41 tornadoes occur each year in the Prairie Provinces.

It is located at 6th and Adams Streets in Springfield, Illinois. The law office has been restored and is operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency as a state historic site. The office building is a surviving portion of what was the Tinsley Block, a brick structure built by local developer Seth M. Tinsley in 1840-1841 to provide office space for professionals working in the newly chosen state capital city. The Illinois General Assembly had moved the capital from Vandalia, Illinois to Springfield in late 1839, and local workers had begun to build a new limestone state house, now the Old State Capitol State Historic Site, on the parcel of land just north of the Tinsley Block. Lawyer Abraham Lincoln and his partner Stephen T. Logan moved their partnership law offices to a third-floor office in the Tinsley Block in 1843. The Illinois Supreme Court, where the partners often pleaded cases, met in the State Capitol across the street, and the U.S. District Court rented space on the Tinsley Block's second floor. The firm of Logan & Lincoln broke up in 1844. Lincoln continued to practice law in the Tinsley Block office and accepted a younger lawyer, William H. Herndon, as his junior partner. The firm of Lincoln and Herndon practiced from the Tinsley Block office from 1844 until about 1852. Lincoln's law work The casual visitor to the Lincoln & Herndon office in 1844-52 might not always have run into the firm's senior partner. Lincoln's duties often demanded that he ride the judicial circuit of counties in central Illinois, trying cases in more than one dozen county courthouses. In addition, Lincoln served one term in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1847 to 1849. The law office today The Lincoln & Herndon firm moved from the Tinsley Block to a new office (since demolished) on the west side of the Old State Capitol square about 1852. In 1872 part of the building was torn down, but the section that had contained Lincoln's law office was preserved. After the building had undergone many further changes, in 1985 it became a state- owned historic site managed by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA). The IHPA has since restored the surviving portion of the Tinsley Block to resemble its operations in the 1840s, with the federal court and the Lincoln and Herndon law office both operating within the building.

After leaving it, he worked as a baker's boy and then a school chef until he joined the British Home Guard during World War II; he served seven years as a military cook.Case Study: 85, and still campaigning for local democracy Paul Kingsnorth, The Ecologist, 1 September 2006. Retrieved 6 February 2013. After the war Papworth trained to be a vicar and became an ordained minister of the Church of England, serving in a number of parishes. In 1997 his comments about the morality of stealing from giant retail corporations resulted in international media attention and he was debarred from preaching.Cleric contorts theft amendment, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel - 17 Mar 1997. Then Home Secretary Michael Howard called the comments \\"Shameful.\\" Papworth said he was not encouraging theft, only saying he could comprehend it. During the Second World War he joined the Communist Party but objected to its authoritarianism and was kicked out. He later joined the Labour Party and was its unsuccessful candidate for Salisbury at the 1955 general election. He also found that party too authoritarian and developed an opposition to large state and mass organizations and a preference for the small community. He came to believe democracies dominated by remote party organizations could not meet peoples needs or stop war.Cyril Dunn, In this world of Bigness a Move to Remain Small, St. Petersburg Times - 18 Apr 1968 . In 1966 he got together with like-minded thinkers E.F. Schumacher, Leopold Kohr and Sir Herbert Read and founded and edited Resurgence magazine.E .F. Schumacher: His Life and Thought by Barbara Wood. Harper & Row, 1984. , (p.348-349). After leaving Resurgence he founded \\"Fourth World Review\\" magazine which promoted \\"small nations, governed by small communities\\". From 1968 the publication sponsored several \\"Assemblies of the Fourth World\\"; these brought together people from around the world who envisioned creating a new society of small communities, small enterprises, and self-government in industry, public utilities, universities, etc. Papworth also ran for British Parliament as a \\"Fourth World\\" candidate.Fighting for the Fourth World, New Internationalist, Issue 97, March 1981. In the 1960s, he was imprisoned along with Bertrand Russell for anti-nuclear protests. Papworth was active as a peace activist and believed small societies were less likely to sacrifice their citizens in nuclear war or afford to pay for such weapons. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Papworth wrote regularly for the pacifist newspaper Peace News.Articles of Peace : Celebrating Fifty Years of \\"Peace News\\", edited by Gail Chester and Andrew Rigby, Prism Press, 1986. (p.22). Papworth was the subject of two BBC documentaries entitled \\"No Man is an Island\\" and \\"Turbulent Priest\\". In 2001, Papworth refused to return his census form stating the government had no right to such information. He was fined £120.Vicar fined for census protest, BBC, 13 September 2001. A longtime resident of London, he later moved to Purton, Wiltshire. He edited a village magazine called \\"Purton Today\\"\\"Purton Today\\", Winter 2013. and was Parish Councillor for Purton.Purton Magazine , June 2006. Papworth's wife predeceased him.

It requires that all GS- compatible equipment must meet a certain set of features and it documents interpretations of some MIDI commands and bytes sequences, thus defining more instrument tones, more controllers for sound effects, etc. GS takes into account some of the criticism of simplicity of original General MIDI standard, while retaining full forward compatibility and even some backward compatibility. GS defines 98 additional tone instruments, 15 more percussion instruments, 8 more drum kits, 3 effects (reverb/chorus/variation) and some other features, thus adding more sounds to the MIDI world. Roland also gave users their own MIDI file player, called SB-55 Sound Brush. The Roland SC-55, the first synthesizer to support the General MIDI standard, also supports the GS standard.  History  Organizations from around the world believed that General MIDI could be made more versatile, so Roland created the GS standard. It is still an extension of the GM specification, meaning it can provide many extra controllers and sounds while still keeping to the sound map and obeying all the protocols of GM. This means the user of the Roland GS standard will also be able to play back any song designed for General MIDI, while still giving the option to add more effects and sounds. Composers can alter sounds with the Roland GS professionally using a set of Roland exclusive system features that allow the reconfiguration and customization to be achieved. The GS extensions were first introduced and implemented on Roland Sound Canvas series modules, starting with the Roland SC-55 in 1991. The first model supported 317 instruments, 16 simultaneous melodic voices, 8 percussion voices and a compatibility mode for Roland MT-32 (although it only emulated it and lacked programmability of original MT-32) and gained explosive popularity. In addition to the Sound Canvas series, Roland also provided GS compatibility in its own professional lineup through the JV-30 keyboard and the VE-GS1 expansion board for other JV-series instruments. In addition, GS compatibility is provided in the GM2 specification which Roland helped to create and actively supports.  Notable features = Banks  The comparison of GS to General MIDI is still there as the program in every individual bank will align with the original 128 in GM's instrument patch map. The Sound Canvas used additional pair of controllers, cc#0 and cc#32, to specify up to 16384 (128*128) 'variations' of each melodic sound defined by General MIDI. Typically, cc#32 (Bank Select LSB) was used to select a family (i.e. 1 - SC-55, 2 - SC-88 etc.) then cc#0 (Bank Select MSB) was used to set a particular variation bank.  Drum kits  MIDI channel 10 is used for drums by default like in General MIDI, but they are accessible on any channel through the use of SysEx. Only 2 different drum kits can be used at a time. There are 15 different kits in total: * 1 Standard Kit * 9 Room Kit * 17 Power Kit * 25 Electronic Kit * 26 TR-808 Kit * 33 Jazz Kit * 41 Brush Kit * 49 Orchestra Kit * 57 SFX Kit * 128 CM-64/CM-32L Kit  Additional percussion notes  There were 16 additional drum notes that span Drum Kits 1 to 49: * 25 Snare Roll * 26 Finger Snap * 27 High Q * 28 Slap * 29 Scratch Push * 30 Scratch Pull * 31 Sticks * 32 Square Click * 33 Metronome Click * 34 Metronome Bell * 82 Shaker * 83 Jingle Bell * 84 Belltree * 85 Castanets * 86 Mute Surdo * 87 Open Surdo  Additional controller events  Additional controller events included in SC-55 and SC-88 were: * 0 Bank select MSB * 5 Portamento time * 32 Bank select LSB * 65 Portamento * 66 Sostenuto * 67 Soft Pedal * 84 Portamento Control * 91 Effect 1 (Reverb) Send Level * 93 Effect 3 (Chorus) Send Level * 94 Effect 4 (Delay) Send Level * 98 NRPN LSB * 99 NRPN MSB * 120 All Sounds Off * 121 Reset all controllers * 123 All notes off  SysEx messages  There were messages that allowed the user to turn the GS mode on/off, to set effects processor parameters, to change EG envelopes etc.  Supporting hardware  Beginning in 1991, Roland introduced GS support in the majority of its MIDI products.

Six months after the Anglo-Irish Treaty ended the recent Irish War of Independence, it was fought between the forces of the new Provisional Government and a section of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) that opposed the Treaty. The Irish Citizen Army also became involved in the Battle, supporting the anti-Treaty IRA in the O'Connell Street area. The fighting began with an assault by Provisional Government forces on the Four Courts building, and ended in a decisive victory for the Provisional Government. Background On 14 April 1922 about 200 Anti-Treaty IRA militants led by Rory O'Connor occupied the Four Courts in Dublin, resulting in a tense stand-off.Younger 1968 pp.258–259 They wanted to spark a new armed confrontation with the British, which they hoped would bring down the Anglo-Irish Treaty, unite the two factions of the IRA against their former common enemy and restart the fight to create an all-Ireland Irish Republic. At the time the British Army still had thousands of soldiers concentrated in Dublin, awaiting evacuation. Winston Churchill and the British cabinet had been applying pressure on the Provisional Government to dislodge the rebels in the Four Courts, as they considered their presence a violation of the Treaty. Such pressure fell heaviest on Michael Collins, President of the Provisional Government Cabinet and effective head of the regular National Army. Collins, a chief IRA strategist during the War of Independence from Britain, had resisted giving open battle to the anti-Treaty militants since they had first occupied Four Courts the preceding April. His colleagues in the Provisional Government Cabinet, including Arthur Griffith, agreed that Collins must mount decisive military action against them.Tim Pat Coogan \\"Michael Collins\\" 1990John M Feehan \\"The Shooting of Michael Collins: Murder or Accident?\\" 1981 Mercier, CorkS M Sigerson \\"The Assassination of Michael Collins: What Happened at Béal na mBláth? 2013\\" In June 1922 the Provisional Government engaged in intense negotiations with the British Cabinet over a draft Constitution that sought to avert the impending civil war. They particularly sought to remove the requirement of an oath to the British Crown by all members of the Dublin government, a key point of contention with anti- Treaty partisans. However, the conservative British Cabinet refused to cooperate.Public Records Office, British Cabinet proceedings 1922Winston Churchill correspondence The pro-treaty element of Sinn Féin won the elections on 16 June. Following the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson in London on 22 June 1922 and the arrest by Four Courts troops of Free State Army Deputy Chief of Staff Gen. J.J. O'Connell, British pressure on the Provisional Government intensified. The British now threatened to invade and re-occupy all of Ireland. On 27 June the Provisional Government Cabinet agreed on an ultimatum to the Four Courts garrison to evacuate or face immediate military action.Eoin Neeson, The Civil War, pp. 109–110Provisional Government Cabinet proceedings 1922, Dáil na hÉireann Churchill offered a loan of British artillery for use by the National Army, along with 200 shells from their store of 10,000 at Kilmainham, three miles away. It is possible that some British special troops were also covertly loaned. Two 18-pounder field guns were placed on Bridge St. and Winetavern St., across the River Liffey from the Four Courts complex. After an ultimatum was delivered to the anti-Treaty garrison on the night of 27 June / early hours of 28 June, the National Army commenced the bombardment of Four Courts.An Léigear 1922 (The Siege of 1922) documentary by TG4 Téiliflis na GaeltachtaMichael Collins personal correspondence No authoritative record exists regarding the order to commence bombardment—when it was issued, by whom, where, etc. Historians have tended to attribute the order to Collins, but some biographers dispute this. Anti-Treaty survivors alleged that they were preparing for an 8:00 a.m. evacuation when the bombardment began at 4:00 a.m. The assault on the Four Courts The Four Courts, seen from its eastern side. Inside the building were 12 members of the Irish Republican Army Executive, including Chief-of-Staff Joe McKelvey, Director of Engineering Rory O'Connor and Quartermaster General Liam Mellows. The garrison consisted of roughly 180 men drawn from the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the IRA's 1st Dublin Brigade, commanded by Commandant Paddy O'Brien, armed for the most part only with small arms (rifles, five Thompson submachine guns and two Lewis light machine guns) apart from one captured armoured car, which they named \\"The Mutineer\\". The members of the IRA Army Executive were the political leaders of the garrison, but served as common soldiers under the command of Ernie O'Malley, commander of the IRA's 2nd Southern Division. The Anti-Treaty side fortified the Four Courts to some extent, planting mines around the complex and barricading the doors and windows, but their leadership ordered them not to fire first, in order to retain the moral high ground, and so the Free State troops were allowed to surround the Four Courts.Paul V Walsh, The Irish Civil War 1922–23 -A Study of the Conventional Phase After the first day's bombardment proved ineffective, the British gave the Free State two more 18-pounder cannon and proffered 60-pounder howitzers along with an offer to bomb the Four Courts from the air. Collins turned down the latter two offers because of the risk of causing heavy civilian casualties.Michael Hopkinson, The Irish Civil War, p120-121 On the 29th, Free State troops stormed the eastern wing of the Four Courts, losing three killed and 14 wounded and taking 33 prisoners. The republicans' armoured car, \\"The Mutineer\\", was disabled and abandoned by its crew. Early the next day Paddy O'Brien was injured by shrapnel and Ernie O'Malley took over military command in the Four Courts. By this time the shelling had caused the Four Courts to catch fire. In addition, orders arrived from Oscar Traynor, the anti-treaty IRA commander in Dublin, for the Four Courts garrison to surrender, as he could not reach their position to help them. At 3:30 p.m. on 30 June, O'Malley surrendered the Four Courts to Brig. Gen. Paddy Daly of the Free State's Dublin Guard unit. Three of the republican garrison had died in the siegehttp://www.anphoblacht.com/news/detail/28711 An explosion at the Four Courts during the bombings. Public Record Office explosion Several hours before the surrender, at either 11:30 or 2:15 the Irish Public Record Office (PRO) block located in the western block of the Four Courts, which had been used as an ammunition store by the Four Courts garrison, was the centre of a huge explosion, destroying Irish state records going back to the Norman conquest. Forty advancing Free State troops were badly injured.Paul V Walsh, The Irish Civil War 1922–23 -A Study of the Conventional Phase Assigning blame for the explosion remains controversial. It was alleged by the National Army Headquarters that the Anti-treaty forces deliberately booby-trapped the PRO to kill advancing Free State troops. Tim Healy, a government supporter, later alleged that the explosion was the result of land mines laid before the surrender, which exploded after the surrender.TM Healy memoirs, chapter 46 However, a study of the battle concluded that the explosion was caused by fires ignited by the shelling of the Four Courts, which eventually reached two truck loads of gelignite in the munitions factory. A towering mushroom cloud rose 200 feet over the Four Courts. Calton Younger identified three explosions: \\"two beneath the Records Office at about 2.15 [pm] and another at the back of the building at about 5 o'clock\\".Younger Calton 1968 p.321, 326 At this stage in the battle troops on each side still had a sense of kinship with the other, as most of them had fought together in the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. By appealing to friends on the Free State side, several anti-Treaty leaders among the Four Courts garrison, notably Ernie O'Malley and Seán Lemass, escaped from captivity to continue fighting elsewhere.Ernie O'Malley, the Singing Flame The destruction of irreplaceable historical record in the PRO explosion (and the 1921 burning of the Custom House) has impaired Irish historiography; some had been calendared to varying degrees. The National Archives of Ireland and Irish Manuscripts Commission have assembled and published original documents from other sources to mitigate the loss. A consortium led by Trinity College Dublin is creating the website \\"Beyond 2022\\" to provide a \\"virtual recreation\\" of the PRO and its contents, in time for the centenary of the explosion. O'Connell Street fighting Guests of the Edinburgh Hotel on O'Connell St. make their way from the hotel on 5 July 1922. Despite the Free State force's success in taking the Four Courts, fighting continued in Dublin until 5 July. On the 29th anti- Treaty IRA units from the Dublin Brigade led by Oscar Traynor had occupied O'Connell Street, part of Parnell Square, York Street and some of other locations to try to distract Free State attention from their attack on the Four Courts. Not all the IRA units in the capital were prepared to fight against the new Irish government, however, and their numbers were probably about 500 throughout the city. Their numbers were supplemented by about 150 Citizen Army men and women who brought with them arms and ammunition dumped since the insurrection of Easter 1916.Liz Gillis, The Fall of Dublin, Mercier 2012, p.57 The republicans occupied the northeastern part of O'Connell St., with their strong point at \\"the block\\", a group of buildings that the Anti- Treatyites had connected by tunneling through the walls. They had also taken over the adjoining Gresham, Crown, Granville and Hammam hotels. Their only position on the western side of the street was in the YMCA building. Additionally, they had an outpost south of the Liffey at the Swan Pub on Aungier St. Oscar Traynor apparently hoped to receive reinforcements from the rest of the country, but only Anti-Treaty units in Belfast and Tipperary replied and both of them arrived too late to take part in the fighting. The Provisional Government troops, commanded by Gen. Tom Ennis, started by clearing out the outlying anti-treaty garrisons, which was accomplished by 1 July. They then drew a tighter cordon around O'Connell St. Artillery was used to drive the Anti-Treaty fighters out of positions on Parnell St. and Gardiner St., which gave the Free State troops a clear field of fire down O'Connell St. The republican outpost in the YMCA was eliminated when Free State troops tunnelled underneath it and detonated a bomb. Traynor's men in \\"the block\\" held out until artillery was brought up, under the cover of armored cars, to bombard them at point-blank range. Incendiary bombs were also planted in the buildings. Traynor and most of his force (70 men and 30 women) made their escape when the buildings they were occupying caught fire. They mingled with civilian crowds and made their way to Blessington. Left behind was Republican leader Cathal Brugha and a rear guard of 15 men, who stayed behind in the Hammam Hotel after Traynor and most other IRA men had left. At 5:00 p.m. on 5 July, when the fires made the hotel untenable, Brugha ordered his men to surrender. He, however, stayed behind, only to emerge from the building alone, armed with a revolver. He was shot in the thigh by Free State troops and died later from blood loss. There were some further sporadic incidents of fighting around the city as Free State troops dispersed anti-treaty IRA groups. Cathal Brugha was the last casualty in the battle for Dublin, which had cost the lives of at least 80 people (15 anti-Treaty IRA Volunteers, 29 National Army soldiers, one British Royal Air Force serviceman and 35 civilians) and over 280 wounded. In addition, the Free State took over 450 Republican prisoners.John Dorney, Casualties of the Irish Civil War in Dublin, The high civilian casualties were doubtless the result of the use of heavy weapons, especially artillery, in a densely populated urban area. Cathal Brugha, Anti- Treaty leader killed during the fighting on Dublin's O'Connell St. Aftermath When the fighting in Dublin died down, the Free State government was left firmly in control of the Irish capital and the anti-treaty forces dispersed around the country. Round-ups after the fighting resulted in more Republican prisoners and the death of prominent anti-Treaty activist Harry Boland who was shot dead in Skerries, County Dublin on 31 July. Oscar Traynor, Ernie O'Malley and the other anti-Treaty fighters who had escaped the fighting in Dublin regrouped in Blessington, around 30 km south-west of the city. An anti-Treaty IRA force from County Tipperary had arrived there but too late to participate in the Dublin fighting. Instead, this force headed south and took a string of towns, including Enniscorthy and Carlow, but quickly abandoned them when faced with superior Free State forces. Most of the Republicans then retreated further south again to the so-called Munster Republic, territory south-west of a line running from Limerick to Waterford. This in turn was taken by the Free State in an offensive from July to August 1922. Four of the Republican leaders captured in the Four Courts, Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Joe McKelvey and Richard Barrett, were later executed by the government in reprisal for the Anti-Treaty side's killing of TD (member of Parliament) Seán Hales. (See Executions during the Irish Civil War.) The street where Cathal Brugha was killed was later renamed Cathal Brugha Street in his honour.

According to this analysis, some ponerine groups may be more closely related to other subfamilies than to each other. The subfamilies of \\"poneromorph\\" Formicidae include: *Amblyoponinae *Ectatomminae (apparently related to the widely distributed and highly diverse Myrmicinae) *Heteroponerinae *Paraponerinae *Ponerinae (in a much more restricted sense) *Proceratiinae. Long considered primitive on the basis of retention of a typical hymenopteran sting and pupae in cocoons, some groups among the poneromorphs exhibit considerable specialization in predatory habits and mandibular form. These two evolutionary developments are often, but not necessarily, seen in association: elongated mandibles with modified teeth for handling large and potentially toxic prey in Amblyopone and Thaumatomyrmex, and strongly modified \\"snap-jaws\\" and associated musculature in the generalized predator Odontomachus. Most poneromorphs are strict predators just like their ancestors (stinging Hymenoptera). Foraging for extrafloral nectar and honeydew from sap-sucking insects has secondarily evolved in Ectatomminae and Paraponerinae, as well as Odontomachus (Ponerinae). A taste for sweets (nectar, fruit) can be considered an evolutionary \\"advancement\\" among the ants.
