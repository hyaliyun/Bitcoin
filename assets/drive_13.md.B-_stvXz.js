Career After leaving Canterbury University, he secured a job writing scripts for radio 3ZD Christchurch. Hoping to expand his horizons, he emigrated to Australia in August 1939 with wife Mona. Introduced by Peter Finch to ABC Federal Controller of Productions Frank Clewlow, who was recruiting staff for the newly reconstituted Argonauts Club and its companion program \\"The Children's Session\\", he was immediately put to work developing the on-air characters of 'Mac', 'Joe' and 'Elizabeth', and concocting humorous vignettes to brighten up the show. He was also writing scripts for the Macquarie Network's Lux Radio Theatre, but with Australia's entry into World War II, he was recruited into the CSIRO, leaving only Sundays for him to develop scripts for the ABC. Mona handled his correspondence as well as scripts and quizzes for the Argosy and Brains Trust, weekend programs associated with the Argonauts. After the War, he was able to devote more attention to stories for the Children's Hour. The Moon Flower, a science fiction serial aired in 1953, was so successful he went on to write a dozen more; all highly speculative yet incorporating important principles of Science. The Stranger was sold overseas as a radio serial and also published as a novel. Around 1957 he and Mona moved to England to gain experience writing for television but kept up his commitments with the ABC by writing a serial The Nomads about a family caravanning about Europe. In the end it ran for 400 episodes. It was not without its detractors, however; in 1960 the politician Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes saw the story as subtle Communist propaganda and made a vitriolic speech to the Ballarat Young Liberals to that effect. Mona Saunders (née Beri) (1910–1994) wrote their joint autobiography Lucky Couple, published in 1998.

Early lives The Sheares brothers were the sons of Henry Sheares, a liberal banker from Cork who also sat in the Irish Parliament for the Borough of Clonakilty. Henry attended Trinity College Dublin, bought an officer's commission and then studied as a lawyer, being called to the bar as a barrister in Michaelmas term, 1790. John had qualified as a barrister in Michaelmas term, 1789. Their father had died in 1776, leaving a large income of £1,200 p.a.Libraryireland article accessed 2009 Politicisation in Paris In 1792 the brothers went to Paris and were swept away by the popular enthusiasms of the French revolution. They met leaders such as Brissot and Roland, both of whom were to be executed in 1793. In particular they witnessed the introduction of the guillotine, on which 1,400 were to die in 1792.Independent, Feb 2007 On the boat from France to England they met Daniel O'Connell (then a student) who was disgusted by the increasingly bloodthirsty nature of the revolution. O'Connell remained an advocate of non-violence thereafter.http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/HenryandJohnShearesUnitedIrishmen.php United Irish They joined the United Irish movement on their return to Dublin in January 1793, when it was still legal. However, France declared war on Britain (and by extension, on Ireland) in February 1793. The Society's initial aims of securing 1) Catholic Emancipation and 2) universal suffrage were unsuccessful, amounting to the administration's 1793 Relief Act. Its stance became more radical, and in turn the Irish administration feared a group inspired by France, banning it in 1794. The Sheares brothers principally organised the movement in Cork, while continuing with their legal careers. A Mr. Conway, one of their keenest members in Cork, informed the administration of their activities.Notes on Conway; accessed Oct 2009 During 1793 the brothers also joined the Dublin Society of the United Irishmen, where another spy, Thomas Collins, passed on their names.McDowell, RB Proceedings of the Dublin Society of the United Irishmen Irish Manuscripts Commission, Dublin 1998; passim. Their two other less famous brothers had enlisted in the British army and were killed in action. On the arrest of most of the United Irish \\"Directory\\" members in March 1798, John was chosen as a replacement on the approach to the outbreak of rebellion. His main act at this point was to decide on the date - 23 May. Arrests The Directory fatally stayed in Dublin, where the United Irish had less support. Already quietly betrayed by Conway and Collins, John also befriended Captain Warnesford Armstrong from County Down, who claimed to be a busy member of the party there. John never checked this, and Armstrong informed the authorities of the brothers' whereabouts, also appearing as a witness in the ensuing trial. They were arrested on 21 May and indicted on 26 June. (Christina, Lady Longford sets her 1942 play 'The United Brothers' in the drawing room of Lady Steele (Maria Verity widow of Sir Parker Steele Bt of Hampstead, Co Dublin) at 11 Merrion Square, Dublin, she had prevented John Sheares from marrying her daughter Maria Steele who later tried to save the brothers.Verity Family Records, Glamorgan Archives (DDXcb) Executions Inevitably the brothers were tried on 12 July, as the rebellion was at its height, and were hanged, drawn and quartered on 14th. The presiding judge was Hugh Carleton, 1st Viscount Carleton, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, who was much criticised for taking the case, as the boys' father, a close friend, had appointed Carleton their guardian. Their lawyer was John Philpot Curran who, with Sir Jonah Barrington, obtained a stay of execution in the hope that Henry would recant, but the brothers were already dead. They were buried at St Michan's nearby. Visitors are brought to their coffins on a tour of St. Michan's vaults. John's speech from the dock was later much quoted, including his justification: :\\"The accusation of which I speak, while I linger here yet a minute, is that of holding out to the people of Ireland a direction to give no quarter to the troops fighting for its defence. My lords, let me say thus, that if there be any acquaintances in this crowded court--I do not say my intimate friends, but acquaintances--who do not know what I say is truth, I shall be reputed the wretch which I am not; I say, if any acquaintance of mine can believe that I could utter a recommendation of giving no quarter to a yielding and unoffending foe, it is not the death which I am about to suffer that I deserve--no punishment could be adequate to such a crime. My lords, I can not only acquit my soul of such an intention, but I declare, in the presence of that God before whom I must shortly appear, that the favorite doctrine of my heart was that no human being should suffer death, but when absolute necessity required it.\\" Family All four Sheares brothers died in the 1790s, but Henry's daughter Mary went on to marry the Revd. Piers Butler in 1823. Their sister Jane Sheares married Henry Westropp and had issue.

His research focused on the biosystematics and life cycle of mosquitoes. Life and work He was born Wilfred Gregor Iltis to Anni (née Liebscher) and Hugo Iltis, a botanist and geneticist who was a life sciences teacher at the German-language gymnasium of Brünn (Brno). His father was also the first biographer of Gregor MendelM. Turda and P.J. Weindling, eds. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European University Press, 2007. and a vocal opponent of Nazi \\"racial science\\". In the fall of 1938, the Iltis family was granted visas to enter the United States thanks to the intercession of the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, along with affidavits of endorsement from Albert Einstein and Franz Boas. In January 1939, when Hitler's military was preparing the invasion of Czechoslovakia, fifteen-year-old Wilfred escaped with his mother and his younger brother Hugh on a harrowing train ride that traversed Nazi Germany to France. During a midnight stop at the Stuttgart station, Gestapo officers combed the train, removing ten passengers; the Iltises survived because the boys pretended to be asleep while their mother pretended to be the wife of a French diplomat. In Cherbourg, they were joined by Hugo Iltis and boarded the passenger ship RMS Aquitania for the Atlantic crossing. They settled in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where the senior Hugo Iltis was soon appointed to a professorship in biology at Mary Washington College. Iltis began his undergraduate studies in 1941 at George Washington University but after one semester transferred to Western Kentucky State Teachers College, pursuing a major in agriculture.http://digitalcommons.wku.edu/dlsc_ua_records/3851/ During World War II, Fred Iltis served in the Army in the South Pacific. In 1948, he married Julia Patricia Zrinyi (Judy) (1926-2004), a graphic artist and scientific illustrator. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in entomology at University of California, Davis. Iltis worked briefly at Harvard in 1967-1968 as a research fellow in Tropical Public Health for the Harvard School of Public Health.https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-346295035/harvard- school-of-public-health-cambridge-mass-annual-catalog-vol After settling in San Jose, California, in the 1960s, Iltis taught in the Biology Department at San José State University. Iltis was a skilled photographer. He developed and printed photos in a basement darkroom, using the slow and complicated archival process system yielding prints that last many decades. In his journeys south of the border (where he met the Mexican photographer Manuel Álvarez Bravo), Iltis portrayed the life of the Mexican Indians, particularly in Michoacán. Many photos of his vast archive document the Civil rights movement of the 1960s, student protests against the Vietnam War, the struggle of the Chicano agricultural workers led by César Chávez and Dolores Huerta, as well as the strikes and boycott of American fruit companies. He met and befriended the renowned photojournalists Hansel Mieth and Otto Hagel, who had documented the Great Depression of the 1930s in Life magazine. From them Iltis learned that \\"a photo can express one’s ideas and ideals far better than a thousand words\\".

The album was recorded in the UK at the Westgreen Studios and in the Netherlands at Wisseloord Studios, Hilversum. The album is a mixture of contemporary pop ballads, such as \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\" from Foreigner, the Jennifer Rush power ballad \\"The Power Of Love\\", and the more gentle \\"Still\\" from Lionel Richie, combined with standards from the field of jazz and pop, such as \\"He Was Beautiful\\", the sweet jazz ballad from Cleo Laine. Several of the song arrangements reflect an operatic pop style influence, which may have roots in her 1984 album I Am What I Am, which she recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the fact that in the latter mid-1980s she started working with a vocal coach, a former opera singer. Bassey returned to the Beatles with \\"Yesterday\\", as she had previously covered \\"Something\\" and \\"Fool on the Hill\\" successfully in the 1970s, and had performed \\"Hey Jude\\" frequently live. Another previously successful formula was used for the closing track \\"Dio, Come Ti Amo (Oh God How Much I Love You)\\" an Italian original in the tradition of \\"This is My Life\\" and \\"Natalie\\". (\\"Dio, Come Ti Amo\\" was the Italian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in 1966, performed in Italian by Domenico Modugno).

Computational informatics can also be interpreted as the use of computational methods in the information sciences.  Development  From a historical viewpoint, medical informatics scientists (also known as medical informaticians) started to use artificial intelligence and Bayesian statistical methods in diagnosis and medical decision making, as early as in the 1970s. An example is the MYCIN system developed at Stanford University. The field has since evolved to use a wide range of computational methods and to interact with all possible scientific and other disciplinary domains. Later, the field integrated the following: * Computational techniques: artificial intelligence, algorithms (for architectures ranging from single CPU to massively parallel machines), programming, object-oriented system design, databases, information retrieval, computer graphics and visualization, data mining, information extraction. * Probability, statistics and decision science: Theory of probability, statistical inference, cost/risk-benefit analysis, probabilistic analysis, stochastic modeling, decision theory, statistical data analysis, probabilistic networks, pattern classification, statistical learning and modeling, statistical data mining. * Applied mathematics: graph theory, differential equations, optimization theory, wavelets, group theory. * Electrical engineering methods: signal and image processing. * Domain knowledge: art and cultural heritage, biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, the World Wide Web. * User sciences: design, human- computer interaction, evaluation. * Cyberinfrastructure for informatics: search engines, digital repositories, storage. * Scientometrics, bibliometrics and economics: science and policy evaluation, data mining and information extraction, knowledge discovery. * Social sciences: social network analysis and metrics.  Education  Several universities offer graduate programs in this area. One example is the Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology. Another example is the Hamburg University of Technology which offers a consecutive Bachelor and Master program with emphasis on computational techniques. Some programs are targeted at specific domains. For instance, the Biomedical Informatics Program at Stanford University focuses on technologies and methods for understanding biomedical data and to improve health care. In Tunisia, University of Manouba offers a Master program called Intelligent and Decisional Informatics which tries to cover all aspect of computational informatics.

The meteor shower was discovered by Hungarian astronomer Miklos von Konkoly-Thege in 1871. This shower has infrequent but relatively bright meteors, with some fireballs. Parent body is comet 169P/NEAT. Peter Jenniskens and Jeremie Vaubaillon identified the parent body as asteroid 2002 EX12, which in the return of 2005 was found weakly active near perihelion. This object is now called comet 169P/NEAT. According to Jenniskens and Vaubaillon, the meteor shower was created about 3,500 to 5,000 years ago, when about half of the parent body disintegrated and fell into dust. The dust cloud evolved into Earth's orbit recently, causing a shower with peak rates of 2-5/h, sometimes having outbursts of bright flaring meteors with rates up to 5-9/h. The bulk of the dust will not be in Earth's path until the 24th century.

He is well known for his observational work on all classes of supernovae, especially the use of Type Ia and Type II supernovae as measures of cosmic distance.  Career  Mario Hamuy is the son of Mario Hamuy Berr, an economist and politician of levantine descent. He studied at Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera of Santiago. Hamuy was a student in astronomy and physics at the University of Chile working with Jorge Melnick. In February 1987, he came to the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and within a few days of his arrival when the Type II supernova SN1987A exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud, he began a major campaign at CTIO to monitor this important supernova.Hamuy et al. 1988, Astronomical Journal, 95, 63 In 1989, in collaboration with Jose Maza, Mark M. Phillips, and Nicholas Suntzeff, he began the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey which led to the pioneering work on the standard candle luminosities of Type Ia supernovae.Phillips, M.

In graduate school at the University of Arizona at the Steward Observatory working with Professor Phil Pinto, he changed his focus to the study of core collapse supernovae, in particular using Type II supernovae to measure geometric distances using the Baade- Wesselink method, also called the expanding-photosphere method (EPM).Hamuy, M., et al. 2001, Astrophysical Journal, 558, 615 With Pinto, he invented a semi-empirical method to measure distances to Type II events, called the Standard Candle method,Hamuy, M., & Pinto, P. A. 2002, Astrophysical Journal Letters, 566, L63 which improved the distance accuracies over EPM.  Awards and honors  Asteroid 109097 Hamuy, discovered by Spanish astronomer Rafael Ferrando at the Pla D'Arguines Observatory in 2001, was named after him. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 February 2011 (). In 2015 he won the National Prize for Exact Sciences.

He spent most of his life in Dawan and he had strong connections with the local Qara Qoyunlu, Aq Qoyunlu, Timurid and Ottoman rulers, accepting a number of important government positions from them. He wrote a number of works on theology, philosophy and law. He died shortly after the founding of the Safavid dynasty, but before Shah Isma'il I captured the province of Fars. Life Davani began his studies with his father, who was a student of Mir Gorgani (d.1413), but moved to Shiraz while he was still young to study theology, philosophy, logic, fiqh and usul ul-fiqh under notable scholars such as Homām-al-Dīn Golbārī, Safiuddin Iji, Muhiyudin Muhammad Kushkenari Ansari (Himself a student of Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, who was also a student of Gorgani). Davani was often in disagreement with his contemporary and fellow philosopher-theologian, Sadruddin Dashtaki, who frequently criticized the former's views and writings. Davani was associated with the royal courts of his time. During his youth, Yusuf, the son of the Qara Qoyunlu Sultan Jahanshah, appointed him to the post of Sadr (religious supervisor). However, he quickly resigned and began teaching at Madrasah-e Begum. He wrote his Akhlaq-e Jalali (lit. 'majestic manners'), an ethical manual modeled on Nasiruddin Tusi's Akhlaq e-Nasiri, for the Aq Qoyunlu Ozun Hasan. His Arz Nameh was written for the latter's son, Khalil. Davani later accepted the position of chief judge for the province of Fars from Sultan Ya'qub. He wrote a discussion on Ali bin Muhammad Qoushchi's commentary on the famous Tajrid ul-Kalam by Nasiruddin Tusi for both the sons of Ozun Hasan. He did oppose Sultan Ya'qub's centralization policies towards the end of the latter's life, but remained on good terms with Sultan Rostam. As well as his strong connection to Shiraz's Turkmen rulers, he was also associated with the Timurid court of Abu Sa'id, dedicated a number of books on Ishraqi philosophy to Sultan Mahmud I of Gujarat and another text to the Ottoman Sultan, Beyazid II. Religious affiliation Dawani's school of thought is a matter of dispute. Later authors portray Dawani as a Twelver Shi'a practicing Taqiyyah during a time of political turmoil, citing a vision he had of the Twelver Imam Reza while visiting Najaf and a book of poetry praising the Twelve Imams and condemning Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman as evidence of this. This was likely written when the Safavid Shah Isma'il I was advancing on Fars, following his capture of Tabriz and declaration of Twelver Shi'ism as the state religion of his dynasty. However, he rejected the Shah's messianic claims and died before the latter put to death the Sunni scholars of the city for refusing to convert to the official creed.

Originally designed to a Royal Air Force (RAF) specification issued during the war for two training seaplanes, three aircraft were produced as a commercial venture. Only the first was sold, the other two being cannibalised for parts and then scrapped in 1924. This design is often referred to as the Short Shrimp although this name was applied only to the first Sporting Type. Design The Sporting Type was designed to meet RAF specification number RAF XXXII. It was a four-seat, single-engined biplane with twin wooden floats mounted on wire-braced struts below the fuselage. It had two cockpits, the forward cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem, the other for two passengers sitting abreast; the rear cockpit could also function as cargo room, increasing the aircraft's operational flexibility. The fuselage was of semi-monocoque plywood construction with a fabric fairing. The upper and lower wings were of equal span and chord; on the first aircraft (named Shrimp) the lower wing had a slight dihedral, while the upper wing was flat. On the two later aircraft, both wings had equal dihedral. All three were fitted with folding wingsBarnes & James 1989, p.161. (which Shorts had developed and patented in the years 1913 -1915Patents secured by Short Brothers including patents nos. 1792/13, 15727/13 and 28610/13, 5290/14, 20537/14 and 9276/15, see Barnes & James, 1989, pp. 92, 110). In plan view, the twin-mainfloats, like those of the Short N.2B, were square-fronted with a slight increase in beam from front to rear, while the stern tapered to a point like a mitred arch. They had a concave bottom (the edges were protected by metal stripsFlight Magazine, Olympia report 1920, p.798.) and a sharp step at approximately 3/4 length; a tailfloat was fitted to the fuselage below the conventional tailplane. Attached to the rear of the tailfloat was a taxying rudder, with an additional drop-plate which improved steering on water, and which, thanks to the hinged mounting at the forward end, would rise up into its recess in the tailfloat on contact with the ground when beaching. Wingtip floats were deemed unnecessary. A detail drawing, which appeared in Flight Magazine in 1920, showed the empennage and tailfloat assembly, including the hinged rudder drop-plate.Flight Magazine, Olympia report 1920, p.796. There was also provision for the attachment of beaching wheels: Each float had a watertight transverse tube, to which a mainwheel could be fitted, and there was a socket for a detachable swivelling tailwheel at the rear of the tailfloat, just forward of the taxying rudder. A side view photograph of the Sporting Type (taken at Olympia in July 1920), showing the port beaching-wheel in place, was published in Flight Magazine.Flight Magazine, Olympia report 1920, p.797. Development The first of the three Sporting Types, (Shrimp), was powered by a Beardmore 160 hp (119 kW) engine. Registered G-EAPZ, it was first flown on 10 December, 1919 by test pilot J.L. Parker.Barnes & James 1989, p.160. Shortly afterwards it was bought by the Australian Lebbeus Hordern, who learned to fly in it. Having had the Beardmore engine replaced by the 230 hp (172 kW) Siddeley Puma, he shipped it to Australia in 1921, where it was reregistered as G-AUPZ in June 1922 (later VH-UPZ). The Shrimp was used in two surveys of the coast of New Guinea, during which a film was made which was later shown in the UK under the name \\"Pearls and Savages\\". It crashed in Sidney Harbour in January 1923 and was written off. The two further Sporting Types remained unnamed. The second was fitted first with the Puma engine and flew for the first time on 28-07-1920, after having been displayed in the same month at London's Olympia exhibition centre. It was found by Parker to have greater lateral stability than the Shrimp, due to the dihedral on both wings. Following an accident in September of the same year, the Puma was replaced by a 300 hp (224 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine. The third aircraft, which first flew on 21-01-1921, was fitted with the Puma engine. Neither aircraft was sold and both were taken out of service and cannibalised for engines and instruments before being scrapped in 1924.Barnes & James 1989, p.162.

Children & the Arts is the only children's charity working with hard to reach children to tackle inequality of access across all art forms and across the whole of the UK. Arts venues and cultural organisations are selected to be part of Children & the Arts' national Start programme that enables them to partner with schools in local areas of deprivation - schools that have very limited arts provision for students and no connection to their cultural community. Children & the Arts provides the three-year framework, guidance and funding for arts organisations to each work with 300-500 schoolchildren every year. Children are introduced to an artform, inspired to find out more, taught how to enhance their experience of the arts through critique and teamwork and, of course, create and perform themselves. The charity was formerly known as The Prince's Foundation for Children & the Arts and was one of the Princes Charities, and prior to that The Prince of Wales Arts & Kids Foundation.The Times Origin Children & the Arts began when The Prince of Wales visited a pupil referral unit in Balsall Heath, Birmingham. While going round the school he saw a class studying Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" under the direction of an inspiring teacher who had roused a great response to the play from the pupils. His Royal Highness was surprised to hear that the children were studying the play without seeing it performed. Coincidentally, the Royal Shakespeare Company was performing \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" at Stratford at the time. Being president of the Royal Shakespeare Company The Prince of Wales suggested that the class might like to go and see it. The class went and, after the performance, the cast entertained them on stage. After the trip all of the students wrote to the Prince saying it was the best experience of their lives. As a result of this experience he decided to take action and began the process which led to the development of his Foundation for Children & the Arts.Daily Telegraph feature ReferencesExternal links * Website Category:Children's charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Arts organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:The Prince's Charities Category:Arts charities ","title":"Children &amp; the Arts"},{"id":"24550585","text":"USS Ozette (YTB-541), later YTM-541, was a United States Navy harbor tug commissioned in 1945 and in service until ca. 1974.

Young Jr. (born June 13, 1951) is a former Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Young was first appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court in 1999, elected in 2000 and 2002, and again won reelection in 2010 for a term ending in 2019. Justice Young announced he would be retiring from the court at the end of April 2017. Young is a self-described judicial traditionalist or textualist. In June 2017, Young announced his intentions to run against Debbie Stabenow in the 2018 senate race, but later dropped out saying he could not raise enough money for his campaign. Early life and education Young was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and grew up in Detroit, Michigan. Young has recounted how he was raised in a city that was operating under de facto segregation at the time; when he was a child, his family was one of the first to integrate northwest Detroit. He attended Detroit public elementary schools and graduated from Detroit Country Day School in 1970, with honors from Harvard College in 1974, and from Harvard Law School in 1977. Professional life In 1978, Young joined the law firm of Dickinson Wright, where he became a partner in 1982. In 1992, he joined AAA Michigan where he served as general counsel. In 1995, Young was appointed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, and later elevated to the Michigan Supreme Court by Governor John Engler in 1999 to replace resigning Chief Justice Conrad Mallett.http://www.micourthistory.org/bios.php?id=112 At his investiture ceremony on February 18, 1999, Judge Damon Keith, of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals administered the oath of office to Young. To mark the occasion, his former law partner at Dickinson Wright, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer explained that Young possessed \\"excellent skill, a great work ethic, and great judicial temperament.\\"Michigan Supreme Court Special Session: Swearing-In Ceremony for Justice Robert P. Young Jr. Attorney General and future-Governor Jennifer Granholm called Young \\"a man of tremendous talent and assiduousness[,] ... an unbelievably fair person[,] ... [and] a rich, wonderful, thoughtful, and fair asset to the Supreme Court of Michigan.\\" Governor John Engler explained that Young \\"is a brilliant scholar, learned in both the state and United States Constitutions.\\" Young won statewide campaigns in 2000 for the remainder of former Justice Conrad Mallett's term, and in 2002 and 2010 for full eight-year terms, the latter of which expires in 2019. During Young's tenure on the Court, an op-ed appeared in the Wall Street Journal praising Young in particular and calling the Michigan Supreme Court \\"what may be the finest court in the nation\\" and \\"a leader in attempting to restore a proper balance between the judiciary, the legislature and the people.\\" Young is an adjunct professor at Michigan State University College of Law. Known for his community involvement in the greater Detroit area, Young currently serves as Chairman of the Board for Vista Maria, a Detroit-based charity for disadvantaged young women. He has previously served as a member of the Advisory Board of the United Community Services of Metropolitan Detroit and as a member of the Board of Trustees of Central Michigan University. Young was named the Jurist of the Year by the Police Officer's Association of Michigan in 2000 and again in 2010. Young was named the American Justice Partnership's \\"Guardian of Justice\\" in 2010. The group explained that Young is a \\"tireless protector of the U.S. Constitution, strong and steady defender of our nation's principles of justice, and unstinting adherent to the intentions and ideals of our nation's founders.\\" Young was elected Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court on January 5, 2011. Young, along with fellow Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, was on Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's list of potential Supreme Court justices in May 2016, though the appointment went to Judge Neil Gorsuch of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, who was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 7, 2017. On March 29, 2017, Justice Young announced that he would retire from the Michigan Supreme Court by April 30 of that year to return to private practice. His retirement from the court became official on April 17, 2017. In April 2017, Young confirmed he was being courted to seek the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow in 2018. He officially joined the race in June 2017 but withdrew from the race in January 2018. Notable Michigan Supreme Court decisions=Property rights Young authored the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in Wayne County v. Hathcock (2004), which involved a dispute over the power of eminent domain to transfer privately owned real estate to another private entity for a commercial business and technology park. Decided one year before the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Kelo v. City of New London, Young's decision held that the Michigan Constitution only allowed eminent domain for \\"public use\\" and determined that three circumstances justified condemnation through eminent domain to a private entity: \\"(1) where 'public necessity of the extreme sort' requires collective action; (2) where the property remains subject to public oversight after transfer to a private entity; and (3) where the property is selected because of 'facts of independent public significance,' rather than the interests of the private entity to which the property is eventually transferred.'\\" Hathcock overturned the 1981 Michigan Supreme Court decision in Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, which Young criticized as a \\"radical and unabashed departure from the entirety of this Court's...eminent domain jurisprudence\\" because it \\"concluded, for the first time in the history of our eminent domain jurisprudence, that a generalized economic benefit was sufficient under [the Michigan Constitution] to justify the transfer of condemned property to a private entity.\\" Voting rights Young authored the Michigan Supreme Court's advisory opinion regarding whether election officials can require photo identification before voting in In Re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding the Constitutionality of 2005 PA 71 (2007). The Court upheld a requirement that voters present photo identification before voting as a \\"reasonable, nondiscriminatory\\" requirement to vote that has the legitimate goal of preserving the fairness of elections. The Court held that the requirement did not amount to a \\"poll tax\\" or present a severe burden on voters. Young explained: \\"the act of reaching into one's purse or wallet and presenting photo identification before being issued a ballot\\" is a reasonable requirement, and even those without identification may simply sign an affidavit in lieu of presenting identification or obtain an identification card free of charge from the Secretary of State. Young also explained that the fundamental right to vote includes the assurance that one's vote will not be cancelled out by fraudulent votes, giving the State a compelling interest to prevent voter fraud in elections. Other constitutional doctrines Young authored the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation v. Nestle Waters North America (2007). which applied Michigan's constitutional standing doctrine to the Michigan Environmental Protection Act. The doctrine of standing (law) involves the ability of a person or corporation to bring a lawsuit, and thus assert legal rights and duties in the courts. As Young's opinion explained: \\"We vigilantly enforce principles of standing in order to vindicate the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers among the coordinate branches of government to which those respective powers have been committed.\\" As the Court had previously articulated in Lee v. Macomb County Board of Comm'rs (2001), which applied principles of federal standing doctrine, standing requires a plaintiff to have suffered \\"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) 'actual or imminent, not \\"conjectural\\" or \\"hypothetical\\" that has a \\"causal connection\\" to \\"the conduct complained of\\" and which is \\"likely\\" to be \\"redressed by a favorable decision\\" by a court. Applying federal and state principles of standing doctrine in Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation, Young's decision concluded that \\"[w]here the plaintiff claims an injury related to the environment, this Court lacks the 'judicial power' to hear the claim if the plaintiff cannot aver facts that he has suffered or will imminently suffer a concrete and particularized injury in fact,\\" such as \\"when the defendant’s activities directly affected the plaintiff’s recreational, aesthetic, or economic interests.\\" Accusation of obstructing a notable investigation rejected by court Special Prosecutor William Forsyth, who has been tasked with investigating the details surrounding Larry Nassar's crimes, has accused MSU of obstructing his probe by withholding critical information under Young's guidance. Young's position was vindicated by the court by order dated March 19, 2019, when the court dismissed Forsyth's subpoena finding that MSU had produced all nonprivileged documents. Publications Young recently published the chapter \\"‘Active Liberty’ and the Problem of Judicial Oligarchy\\" in The Supreme Court and the Idea of Constitutionalism, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2009. His other publications include \\"A Judicial Traditionalist Confronts the Common Law,\\" and \\"A Judicial Traditionalist Confronts Justice Brennan's School of Judicial Philosophy.\\" Young is a co-editor of Michigan Civil Procedure During Trial, 2d Ed. (Michigan Institute of Continuing Legal Education, 1989) and Michigan Civil Procedure, (Michigan Institute of Continuing Legal Education, 1999). Personal life Young has been married for over 40 years; he and his wife, Dr. Linda Hotchkiss, have two adult children. They lived in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan when Young was appointed to the Michigan Supreme Court. Young and his wife currently live in the Lansing, Michigan area.

(In Spanish) is the name for numerous traditional dishes from Iberian Peninsula and Latin America. Regional variations=Argentina In Argentina, mazamorra is a traditional dish. It is a dessert with native roots made with white maize, water, sugar, and vanilla. A variant, which is the most consumed in the country, is mazamorra with milk. In this recipe, milk is added to the previous ingredients. Mazamorra is usually made with the same boiled maize used to make locro. As with locro, it is common to eat mazamorra on national holidays, like 25 de mayo and independence day. Colombia Antioquia Initially, mazamorra was the stew which fed galeotes (the rowers, almost always forced, in the ships called galeras) and sailors. The dish consisted of any available vegetables, most often peppers, lentils, and chickpeas, cooked together. In central Colombia, there is still a type of vegetable stew with this name. Today, however, mazamorra is more commonly a corn-based beverage, with different presentations in various parts of the country. For many Colombian speakers, it is simply very-well-cooked peeled corn, also known as peto. Its texture and appearance vary depending on the region, but usually, mazamorra has a white or yellow appearance according to the maize that is used; its texture is generally soft and mushy. In Antioquia, it often accompanies panela and is a very popular side dish to meals such as bandeja paisa. The drink typically includes maize grains, crushed with mortar and pestle, then soaked in water with soda lye (although the traditional reagent used is fern ash, which contains high amounts of potassium carbonate), and finally cooked until soft. Mazamorra is very common during lunch and dinnertime at any time of year. The mazamorra is a typical Colombian food that is served as an accompaniment or as a main dish, whether familiar or casual. It is usually sold as \\"street food”. Usually, the consumer adds the milk and the panela to the mazamorra base. In Cundinamarca and Boyacá, where the corn is cooked with onions, coriander, garlic, faba beans, potatoes and mashuas, often with pieces of ribs or beef. This dish is known as mazamorra chiquita (small mazamorra). Dominican Republic & Cuba In the Dominican Republic and Cuba this dish is known as majarete. Corn is cut off the husk, blended with milk, butter, water, sugar and cornstarch. It is then boiled until thick with cinnamon sticks. In Cuba raisins, vanilla and lemon zest can be added. Once cooled the pudding is garnished with nutmeg and cinnamon. Both countries came to have originated the dish. But because of some much migration between the two countries the origin is lost. Paraguay Also known as kaguyjy in Guaraní, Mazamorra in Paraguay is made with the native locro variety of maize. It is one of the most traditional desserts of the country. According with the ingredients added to the cooked corn, the dish is denominated kaguyjy eírare (Honey mazamorra), kaaguyjy kambýre (milk mazamorra) or kaguyjy azucáre (sugar mazamorra). Kaguyjy reached great popularity in Paraguay due to the food scarcity during the Paraguayan War (between 1864 and 1870) as a nutritious substitute for a regular meal.\\"Karú rekó – Antropología culinaria paraguaya\\", by Margarita Miró Ibars Peru Peruvian Purple Mazamorra Mazamorra in Peru is made with a local variety of maize, purple corn, rich in anthocyanin which gives the mazamorra a deep purple color. The maize is cooked with pineapple, cinnamon and sweet potato flour. This dish is made specially in October for the celebrations of the Lord of Miracles day 333. This purple corn is also used to make chicha morada, a sweet beverage. Costa Rica Costa Rican mazamorra is basically a corn porridge, which is made cooking the maize in milk, clove, vanilla, and adding corn starch. Puerto Rico Puerto Rican mazamorra, is fresh corn custard. Corn kernels are cut off the cob and boiled with milk and cob until the corn softens. Once soft, the cob is discarded and the corn is put into a blender with the milk. Once made into a paste, the corn is passed through a chinois back into the pot for a second time. The liquid is then cooked with corn starch, butter, coconut cream, coconut milk, evaporated milk, ginger, clove, cinnamon, star anise, vanilla, lime peel and sugar. It is then topped with powdered nutmeg and cinnamon. Spain Cordobense mazamorra is a traditional dish made of almonds, bread, garlic, oil and vinegar.

Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, the archbishop of Rouen, became aware of Bellenger's previous travels and sponsored a trip to explore and trade along the coast of Nova Scotia. He was also to establish a small post to be left manned while the ship returned to France. In early 1583, the ship left for the New World and Bellenger explored and traded extensively and recorded his findings. It is certain that Bellenger's records of his journey were quickly available in Europe as the English writer, Richard Hakluyt, soon made contact with him. The information of the trip was readily shared with Hakluyt and recorded in detail. Because of the involvement of Hakluyt, the interest and knowledge of this part of the America's was widely circulated making Étienne Bellenger's contribution to exploration in Nova Scotia even more important.

Renaming themselves New Hearts, they were signed by CBS Records at the height of punk rock just two months after their debut gig, and with an average age of just 17, directly from CBS managing director Maurice Oberstein, who had taken a personal interest in the band and attended eight gigs in a row. They appeared on the opening day of the 1978 Reading Rock Festival alongside the likes of The Jam, Ultravox and Sham 69. New Hearts recorded two singles for CBS, \\"(Just Another) Teenage Anthem\\" and the Martin Gordon-produced \\"Plain Jane\\", inspired by acts like Dr. Feelgood and Eddie & The Hot Rods. They also supported The Jam during their lengthy UK Modern World tour, and accompanied them at the 1978 Reading Festival, where they were joined on stage by Hawkwind guitarist Huw Lloyd Langton. Disillusioned, Page and Cairns then folded New Hearts, and set about creating a new band inspired by the dress code and musical stylings of the 1960s mod movement, changing their name to Secret Affair and leading the whole mod revival movement.

Founded in 1935 as the only congressionally chartered MFA program in U.S. history, it began in New York and was essentially the national theater company of the United States. Originally named the American National Theatre and Academy, the school operated its own Broadway venue for its last 30 years in New York at what is now the August Wilson Theatre. In 1984 when it ran into financial difficulties, Denver Center founder Donald Seawell transferred the charter and remaining resources to Denver and reopened it as the National Theater Conservatory MFA program. The school closed in June 2012 after graduating eight final students.ibid At the program's height, twenty-four students performed alongside the Tony Award-winning Denver Center Theatre Company in a 10-play season. With a 3:1 student/teacher ratio and guest instructors including Edward Albee, Sir Peter Hall and Bill Pullman, students earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in Acting and an Actor's Equity membership. Its mission was to provide gifted students from across the nation the opportunity to develop their talents and skills within the challenging environment of a performing arts center and to prepare them for active careers in the American theatre and in the film and television industries. The National Theatre Conservatory's MFA training program was designed to bring all students closer to the realization of their potential while steadily developing insights, attitudes, standards and disciplines that will nourish them for the rest of their creative lives. Consistently ranked as one of the top ten schools of its kind in the United States, the National Theatre Conservatory admitted 8 students per year from nearly 600 applicants. After three years, graduates emerge with the skills required for a professional career. Because the NTC believed in each student's ability and potential, a full three-year tuition scholarship and a weekly stipend was offered. The Actor Training Program prepared students for full careers in the performing arts, including house management, fundraising, marketing, event planning and press relations. Performances by students in studio productions were scheduled to enable the artists, artisans and staff of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts to attend. During the latter half of the second year, students spent a portion of their time apprenticed to the Denver Center Theatre Company. Entrance into the third and final year began a full-time apprenticeship with the Theatre Company where students participated more fully in rehearsals and performances of the company. After completion of the apprenticeship, students were featured in their own fully produced mainstage productions. Known as the NTC Rep, these two plays were performed alternately throughout a three-week period in The Conservatory Theatre. Following the NTC Rep, the students graduated and traveled to New York for a Showcase performance in front of agents and casting directors. Graduates working throughout the United States January LaVoy, Julia Pace Mitchell Sarah Wayne Callies and many others. Guest instructors often provided the students with additional insight into their future careers. These visiting artists included John Barton, Israel Hicks, Hal Holbrook, Jamie Horton, Terrence McNally, Marion Ross, Patrick Stewart and Anthony Zerbe among many others.

He found Wesleyan theology as a young man and went on to become a much loved and revered driving force of early Methodism in London, becoming influential in continuing the First Great Awakening started by George Whitefield in the 1740s. Hyatt preached regularly in the East End slums of Hackney in London. He gained a large following and was always in demand for his sermons, which were greatly influenced by those of John Wesley and George Whitefield. Family John HyattThe official Hyatt Family history http://www.hyattfamily.co.uk was born on 12 January 1767 in Sherborne, Dorset, to John Guppy Hyatt and Elizabeth Hyatt. He was baptised on 24 January 1767, in Sherborne. Hyatt died on 30 January 1826, aged 59, in Hackney, London, and was buried in Bunhill Fields, London. Hyatt married at the age of 20 years and his wife, Elizabeth Westcombe, was born in 1765 in Kingston, Somerset to William Westcombe and Eleanor Varder. She was baptised on 8 February 1765, in Kingston St Mary, Somerset. She died in 1832, aged about 67, and was also buried in Bunhill Fields cemetery. Elizabeth Westcombe was a niece of the Rev. Daniel Varder, a Dissenting Minister, who arrived in Sherborne around 1757. Some time after this, his niece Elizabeth Westcombe joined him. Daniel Varder was ordained a Minister on 6 October 1757 in Sherborne. Of Hyatt's parents, little is known other than that his father was abandoned as a young man when his own father left for the East Indies from Sherborne. There is no trace of his demise. It is said of Hyatt's father \\"that having no friends possessed of considerable means, was taken in and trained up amidst scenes of obscurity and dependence. When but very young, he entered upon the married life, after which he commenced business in a small public house in his native town, where, by the aid of divine providence, and a prudent and excellent wife, he brought up a numerous family in decency and comfort\\".Quoted from family correspondence, researched by Paul F. Cranefield for his book 'Born Wanderer: The Life of Stanley Portal Hyatt' Biography Hyatt was said to be a young man of ill repute, brought up in the Crosskeys inn, Sherborne, Dorset (still existing today). At 14 he was an apprentice cabinet maker. At 18 he took charge of the cabinet makers upon the death of the owner, but he was not really interested. He was more interested in spending his time at the family inn, drinking and getting into bad company. He soon became \\"ungodly\\" and took to \\"sinful pleasures\\" In his late teens he met Elizabeth Westcombe. Her father had an extensive library and Hyatt soon began to educate himself there in order to be close to Elizabeth. Hyatt married Elizabeth in 1787. According to a record in Alfred W Light's bookAlfred W Light 'Bunhill Fields' 1913 https://archive.org/stream/bunhillfieldswri00lighuoft#page/n207/mode/1up about the Bunhill Fields burial ground in London, one of Hyatt's unnamed biographers said this of his relationship with his father: In 1794 he became friendly with the Rev J. Weston, a visiting Wesleyan preacher. This led to Hyatt preaching his first sermon at Compton, near Sherborne. Over the next two years he visited chapels nearby to preach and gained a good following, including in Mere, Wiltshire, where he built a chapel.John Hyatt, 'Sermons on various subjects', edited by Charles Hyatt, 1829, to which is prefixed a memoir to John Hyatt. Hyatt was ordained on 17 July 1798.\\"The Surman Index Online\\", Dr Williams's Centre for Dissenting Studies, http://surman.english.qmul.ac.uk He then moved to Frome in Somerset and in 1799 he became the Pastor of the Zion Congregational Church in that town, but soon resigned that office in May 1805 when his peers in the church sent him (not entirely at his own wish) to London. He was sent to Whitefield's Tabernacle, Tottenham Court RoadA Discourse delivered at Ebenezer Chapel, Shadwell, 19 February 1826, on the occasion of the death of the Reverend John Hyatt, containing a full account of his early life. to become the co-pastor with Matthew Wilks (father of John Wilks). In relinquishing his Frome charge, much to the distress of his congregation, he said: In 1805 he became co-pastor and a Minister of the London Tabernacle for the next 20 years or so until his death from asthma, becoming a celebrated man. Among his many spiritual and charitable works he was instrumental in founding the Aged Pilgrims' Friend Society,“The Aged Pilgrims’ Friend Society”, http://www.pilgrimsfriend.org.uk/home originally set-up in 1807 to provide grants and pensions to needy elderly Christians. As recorded in Mr. J. E. Hazelton's \\"Inasmuch\\", Hyatt was closely connected with the society and he drew up the second address that was issued by the committee. The ministry has grown so that it now has 16 schemes throughout England, providing a range of services for older people, from sheltered housing through to nursing and dementia care, as well as home-leave accommodation for missionary families. During his time at the tabernacle, Hyatt was well known for his forthright sermons which were printed eagerly by the popular press and the evangelical chronicles of the time. These publications generated vast amounts of income for the church and for John, most of which he passed to missions and friendly societies in his travels. His career was well followed in the press as he travelled around the countryside preaching to any that would listen, especially those congregations in the chapels set up by Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon during The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, a small society of evangelical churches founded in 1783 and strongly associated with the Calvinist Methodist movement of George Whitefield. Hyatt was greatly involved with charitable societies, often being seen at meetings of the London Missionary Society and seamans' missions along the Thames. He is also to be found in Dublin in 1821, preaching there and in more than 40 other towns and villages in the north of Ireland. Over the next few years he is to be found preaching in Kent, Wiltshire, Bristol, Northampton, York and many other places that wanted to hear his renowned sermons. He was very well respected, and influenced the likes of Edward Mote, who wrote more than one hundred hymns published in his book, \\"Hymns of Praise (London, 1836). His hymn, \\"The Solid Rock\\" lives on today in many church services. During his life in London, John lived at 61 Great Russell St., Bloomsbury Square.

They enjoy a comfortable life with their parents Tom and Helen Lawrence. Helen's brother is Harry Burton, a wealthy bachelor who, although never having had one, is an expert on knowing how to raise children. When Tom and Helen receive a letter from Harry, in which he announces he will travel to them for a vacation, they see an opportunity to get a break from the kids. Knowing that Harry is an expert on children, they assume that he will appreciate the gesture and leave just after he arrives. Unbeknownst to them, Harry only wrote a book about raising children because his publisher told him to, and actually he isn't fond of children at all. He reluctantly takes the position as the babysitter of his nieces and is escorted by Alice Mayton, the Lawrence's attractive neighbor. It soon becomes clear that Harry won't get any rest, as the careless girls often annoy him by getting themselves into danger or going through his possessions. Many of the dangerous situations Toddie gets herself into include climbing a tree and attempting to shave herself. Although they always try to help him out, Toddie and Budge only make things worse. Harry is only irritated by their constant attempts to comfort him and isn't able to take advantage of his own advice on raising children. He writes Helen a letter, in which he threatens to abandon the girls if she doesn't return immediately. However, before he is able to send it he is interrupted by a visit from Alice. Alice has always been a big admirer of his work, but notices that he isn't a real expert on parenting. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, she invites him over for dinner. Harry, secretly having a crush on Alice, accepts the invitation and shreds the letter into pieces. He wants to win over her affection at dinner and buys some fancy flowers. Unbeknownst to him, Toddie had secretly replaced the flowers with her doll. As he hands Alice the box, she is surprised to receive the doll, but thinks of it as a comic gesture. While Harry and Alice grow closer, the children run away to follow a dog they notice. Harry and Alice immediately start to look for them and they cross a group of Spanish gypsies. Noticing a piece of clothing on the ground belonging to one of the girls, Harry suspects that they have kidnapped the girls and violently starts to look for them. Meanwhile, the girls are playing with the dog on the railroad tracks and are almost hit by a train. Coincidentally, Tom and Helen are traveling on that train to surprise the girls with an early return. They are devastated that their daughters almost died and think that Harry is fully responsible. They start yelling at Harry, until they find out how fond the daughters are of him. The film ends with Harry and Alice kissing each other.

Plot The movie is all about the relationships between two rare bred men from extremely different strata of society, but more in common than is apparent from the first look. They might have never run into each other, with their stark contrast in nature and life styles and would have hardly given each other a second look, if they hadn't met in these defined circumstances. But the movie throws them together, intertwined in worst of their days and progressively built in the rapport between the extremes, and infuses the spirit of worthy and meaningful life to all in the screen and those who watches them on screen. Mammootty plays the lead role Mike Philippose, a barefooted uneducated simpleton who lands in the city, armoured with his loud voice, opinions and dazzling wit to stand up with the different level of etiquettes he finds in the flats of the city. His arrival is as a kidney donor to ailing Anand Menon, an astrophysicist who returned to his home nation after working in US for the last forty six years. A dejected man who wants to run away from his memories, Menon is turned into the reverse track by Mike, who lives with his memories and snobs about his deceased father and about the silent hamlet of Thopramkudy. The movie packs a lot of characters like the old man (Janardhanan) in legal tussle with his children, the fighting couple (Kalpana and Reghu) who even don't like to see face to face, a secretary of the flat residents (Jagathy) who only has a dog for his company, a group of loud bachelors and a kid who turns into a brat, left alone and away from her parents.

Horses with roan coats have white hairs evenly intermingled throughout any other color. The head, legs, mane and tail have fewer scattered white hairs or none at all. The roan pattern is dominantly-inherited, and is found in many horse breeds. While the specific mutation responsible for roan has not been exactly identified, a DNA test can determine zygosity for roan in several breeds. True roan is always present at birth, though it may be hard to see until after the foal coat sheds out. The coat may lighten or darken from winter to summer, but unlike the gray coat color, which also begins with intermixed white and colored hairs, roans do not become progressively lighter in color as they age. The silvering effect of mixed white and colored hairs can create coats that look bluish or pinkish. Identification Horses with the roan pattern have an even mixture of white and colored hairs in the coat. These interspersed white hairs are more scattered or absent on the horse's head, mane, tail, and lower legs. The unaffected color on the legs often forms a sharp, inverted \\"V\\" above the knee and hock, not seen in other roan-like coat patterns. The non-white background coat may be any color, as determined by unrelated genetic factors. Often, the background coat color is used in combination with the word \\"roan\\" to describe the shade of a roan horse's coat, such as bay roan or gold champagne roan. However, there are also colloquial terms used for some colors. The most common terms for various roan colors are the following: Corn marks or corn spots occur where a roan's skin has been damaged. The hair grows back in without any white. * Blue roan is loosely applied to any roan with a dark underlying coat that gives it a bluish cast. But in the strictest sense, \\"blue roan\\" is a common synonym for a roan with a black background coat. * Red roan used to include both chestnut and bay roans. In 1999, the American Paint Horse Association changed its coat color descriptions: roans with a chestnut background coat are registered \\"red roan\\", while \\"bay roan\\" is its own category. The American Quarter Horse Association followed suit in 2003. Previously, the term Strawberry roan described the pinkish color of a light chestnut or sorrel roan. While less common, the term lilac roan may be applied to a dark chestnut roan, and honey roan to palominos or the lightest sorrels. *Bay roan replaced red roan as the term for a roan with a bay background coat. Some roan horses have more white hair than others, and even individual horses may look lighter or darker based on the season and their coats may vary from year to year. While roan is always present at birth, the soft first coat of newborn foals may not show the white hairs well. Some roan horses get darker with age. Generally, roans appear to have more white hair when they have their short summer coats and darker when they have their winter coats. These peculiar tendencies of roans led to the Icelandic word for roan, which translates as \\"always changing color.\\" The forelegs of this bay roan show the characteristic inverted \\"V\\" of dark hair not affected by roan. Roans have other unusual characteristics. If the skin is damaged by even a very minor scrape, cut or brand, the coat grows back in solid-colored without any white hairs. These regions of solid-colored coat are called \\"corn spots\\" or \\"corn marks\\" and can appear even without the horse having had a visible injury. Another trait is reverse dappling; many horses develop rings of hair that appear slightly different-colored, called dapples, which often indicate good health. Usually dapples are darker than the surrounding coat, but on a roan, the dapples are lighter. Terminology In the most general sense, the word \\"roan\\" refers to any animal with a mixture of white and colored hairs in the coat.\\"roan, a. and n.1\\" Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd edition 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 3 June 2008. . Recent research into equine coat color genetics indicates that \\"true roan\\" or \\"classic roan\\" is distinct from several similar patterns which are collectively called \\"roaning.\\" In studies of the white patterning genotypes of laboratory mice, no fewer than four produced roaning or flecking. Therefore, the existence of other types of roaning conditions not covered by those mentioned here is possible and likely. The patterns identified as \\"roaning\\" have particular qualities that can be used to tell them apart from true roan. Roan mimics A young gray horse may appear roan, but will become lighter with age Gray vs. roan Blue roans, such as these may be confused with young gray horses or blue duns Roans are sometimes mistaken for grays. However, grays lighten with age, while roans do not. Gray is one of the most common coat colors found in horses, and is found in almost all breeds. The defining characteristic of the gray coat is that it becomes progressively lighter over time. Gray foals may be born any color, and there may be no indication of the future gray coat at birth. Mature grays may retain none of their original coat color, and have a \\"white\\" coat, while the color of the skin and eyes is unchanged. The first white hairs are usually seen around the muzzle and eyes. As a gray may go from entirely colored to entirely white over the course of its life, the process of \\"graying out\\" can, at times, closely resemble roan. Thoroughbred and Arabian horses registered as \\"roan\\" are often gray, especially chestnuts turning gray. Unlike grays, roans do not develop more white hair with age, and without white markings, roans retain colored heads. A blue dun or grullo has no intermingled white hairs in its body coat. Dun vs. roan Blue dun or grullo (also grulla, mouse dun) coloring is created by the dun gene acting on a black base coat, is a coat color with a bluish cast and darker points.Sponenberg, Dan Phillip (2003). \\"Grullo is the Spanish name for the crane bird, and these horses are similar to the bluish color of the sandhill crane.\\" pg 37. Unlike blue roans, grullos are solid color and appear bluish due to low amounts of pigment in each hair, not interspersed white hairs. Like other dun coat colors, grullos have dark or black primitive markings, always including a stripe down the back. Rabicano vs. roan An extensively expressed rabicano Arabian horse. A bay roan that also has bay rabicano features evidenced by the light hairs in its mane and base of tail One pattern of roaning is rabicano, also called white ticking. While true roans have an even intermixture of white hairs throughout the body, except the extremities, the white hairs of a rabicano are densest around the base of the tail and the flank. Rabicano roaning frequently forms rings of white hair around the base of the tail, and in extensively roaned rabicanos, the white hairs may converge to form vertical stripes over the ribcage. Rabicano is found in many breeds, and may account for some \\"roan\\" Arabians. A varnish roan Appaloosa, showing white sclera, mottled skin, and darker bony regions such as the cheekbones. Sabino vs. roan Roaning is also associated with some of the sabino white spotting patterns. There are many patterns in many breeds called \\"sabino,\\" and these patterns usually feature irregular, rough-edged patches of white that originate from the lower legs, face, and ventral midline. The borders of these white patches can be heavily roaned, and some sabinos can be mistaken for roans. The roaning of sabinos will originate in a white patch, and the roaning is uneven. Varnish roan vs. roan The leopard complex colors, characteristic of the Appaloosa breed, have several manifestations that feature mixtures of white and colored hairs. A varnish roan, one type of leopard complex coat color also called \\"marble\\", is an all-over blend of white and colored hairs. Patches of skin that lie close to the bone, such as on the face and legs, and the point of shoulder and point of hip, do not grow as much white hair. These darker patches are called \\"varnish marks\\" and are not found in true roans. Varnish roans can also be distinguished from true roans by the presence of leopard complex characteristics, such as the white sclera, finely striped hooves, and mottled skin around the eyes, muzzle, and genitals. A Paso Fino with both roan and sabino patterning. The white at the end of the tail indicates gray, as well. Prevalence True or classic roan is common in European draft breeds such as the Brabant, Ardennes, Trait Du Nord, Italian Heavy Draft, and Rhenish-German Cold-Blood. It is also found regularly in North American breeds like the Quarter Horse, Paint Horse, Peruvian Paso, Paso Fino, Standardbred, Spanish Mustang, and Tennessee Walking Horse. British ponies such as Dales Ponies, Welsh Ponies, Gypsy Cobs, Shetland Ponies, Connemara ponies, and New Forest ponies may be roan. Icelandic horses and Miniature horses may also be roan. Some roan Trakehners and American Saddlebreds are known. The Hokkaido Pony of Japan may also be roan.Overton, Rebecca (2004). \\"Other studies discovered them in two other equine breeds, the Ardennais, found in France, and the Hokkaido, which live in Japan.\\" True roan has not been satisfactorily identified in Arabians or Thoroughbreds. Despite this, Thoroughbreds and Arabians with roan- like coats are sometimes registered as \\"roan.\\" Thoroughbred \\"roans\\" are described by the Jockey Club as a mixture of white with red or brown hairs, but which researchers identify as chestnuts turning gray. The Arabian Horse Association defines \\"roan\\" as an even mixture of white and colored, usually chestnut, hairs, but researchers suggest this may actually be a unique type of white pattern, probably rabicano, or, occasionally, minimally expressed sabino. brand on her hindquarters, which has grown back in without white hairs. Genetics Roan is a simple dominant trait symbolized by the Rn allele. Traits that are dominantly-inherited cannot skip generations, meaning that two non-roan parents cannot produce a roan offspring. In cases where roan has appeared to skip generations, one of the parents is usually discovered to be slightly roaned. A roan can also be born from two seemingly non-roan parents if the roan coat is \\"masked\\" by extensive white markings or gray. In some cases, the supposedly roan offspring is not true roan at all, but rabicano, sabino, or influenced by some other genetic factor. The University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine's genetics services have developed a DNA test that uses genetic markers to indirectly determine the number of Rn or rn alleles a horse has. The mutation responsible for true roan has not yet been identified exactly, but been assigned to equine chromosome 3 (ECA3) in the KIT sequence. A roan zygosity test is reliable for American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, Welsh Pony, and Gypsy Cob. Until a direct test is developed, the roan zygosity test may enable breeders to produce roans more reliably. Reverse dapples on a bay roan. Homozygous roan A 1979 study of American-bred Belgian draft horses found fewer roan offspring from roan-to-roan matings than expected for a simple dominant trait. Finding neither stillborn nor sickly, short-lived foals from these roan parents, the researchers concluded that in the homozygous condition the roan gene was lethal to the embryo or fetus. Other studies at the time were using progeny ratios to identify potential lethality related to other coat colors, such as \\"dominant white\\" and \\"lethal white,\\" and so roan was believed to follow a similar pattern. Genetic science in the 1970s could not provide a clear answer, as methods of molecular analysis had not yet been developed.\\"The paper by Hintz and Van Vleck caused all this commotion, but there were earlier mentions of a roan cross being lethal, too,\\" Penedo explained. \\"But it was never fully established by any molecular analysis that homozygous roan horses would not be produced from matings of two roan parents.\\" in Overton, 2004. The belief in \\"lethal roan\\" persisted until recently, when homozygous roan stallions with large numbers of offspring - all roan - were satisfactorily identified. Homozygous roan stallions were identified in both European populations of Belgian horses in 1977, and in North American, in Quarter Horse stallions. In some breeds, homozygous roans can be identified by an indirect DNA marker test. Such horses, with the genotype Rn/Rn, produce 100% roan offspring. Homozygous roans and heterozygous roans (Rn/rn) are identical in appearance. Equine linkage group II During the production of sex cells, DNA is \\"reshuffled\\" to ensure that the next generation does not inherit, for example, grandpa's chromosome 8, but a mixture of DNA from each parent. Instead, paired chromosomes exchange parallel pieces of DNA, a process called chromosomal crossover, prior to being passed on to the next generation. When particular genes are located physically close together on a chromosome, they tend to be passed on together. The rate at which two genes are passed on together can be used to calculate their distance from each other on the chromosome. Genes which tend to be passed on as a group form what is called a \\"linkage group.\\" Duke of Württemberg, has dark extremities and corn spots. Equine linkage group II includes a number of genes. The first linkage was found between a blood type marker and tobiano white spotting in 1978. The same blood type marker, albumin, was linked to another blood protein called vitamin D-binding protein. In 1982, a linkage grouping was proposed, including three genes for serum proteins, and three for coat color: tobiano spotting, chestnut, and roan. Research since equine linkage group II was defined has identified the exact location of the tobiano allele and the chestnut allele. The region of the chromosome that harbors the roan gene is homologous to parts of chromosomes in other species that also control coat color, even some similar to roan. Presently, the KIT gene is the primary candidate gene for roan. While a chromosomal inversion of KIT causes tobiano white spotting, KIT also harbors one or more alleles responsible for sabino spotting, no fewer than eleven alleles responsible for dominant white spotting, and is thought to be a major contributor to many other forms of less distinctive white markings. The effect of linkage between roan and chestnut is readily observed. If a horse possesses one chromosome with the wildtype non-chestnut allele and the dominant roan allele (E and Rn), while the other chromosome contains the recessive chestnut allele and the recessive non-roan allele (e and rn), he will outwardly appear blue roan, barring the influence of other genes. Normally, the chestnut and roan alleles would be separated during chromosomal crossover, but these two linked genes will usually remain together. Such a horse will produce sex cells that are either E/Rn or e/rn. Mated to chestnut non-roan partners (e/rn), the horse would produce primarily blue roans, or chestnut non-roans, but few chestnut roans and few black non-roans. If, on the other hand, the recessive e and dominant Rn were on the same chromosome, the horse would be expected to produce primarily chestnut roans and non-chestnut non-roans with chestnut, non-roan partners.

Early life Paul Chalfin was born on November 2, 1874 in New York to Colonel Samuel Fletcher Chalfin and Jane Voorhees (Connolly) Chalfin. In 1894 Chalfin began studying at Harvard University and left after two years to become an artist, enrolling at the Art Students League of New York to study painting. After graduation in 1898 he was accepted at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France where he studied painting with Jean-Léon Gérôme, a historic genre painter who had previously taught Thomas Eakins. Although Chalfin possessed excellent taste in building design, utilized his extensive observation of European buildings and monuments, and liked being mistaken for an architect, he never studied or obtained a degree in architecture, nor was he an architect. Career While studying in Paris, Chalfin also traveled to Italy in 1899. In 1902 he received honorable mention for the Lazarus Scholarship for his mural painting on the subject of spring. Chalfin returned to Massachusetts in 1903 to succeed Walter T. Cabot as Curator of Chinese and Japanese art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. While Curator he published a 27-paged catalogue entitled 'Japanese wood carvings, architectural and decorative fragments from temples and palaces.' Vizcaya as seen from Biscayne Bay In 1905, the Lazarus Scholarship committee granted him a three-year scholarship to study mural painting in Italy, and in 1906 Chalfin moved to Rome where he lived at the American Academy. Over the next three years, Chalfin split his time between Rome, Florence, Venice and Paris, studying and copying the works of Piranesi, Fra Angelico and Tiepolo, as well as copying a lunette by Jacopo Pontormo at a villa in Florence, most likely Vertumnus and Pomona. His final month abroad was in Paris, completing his scholarship by painting a large decorative panel entitle The Poet in 1908. In 1909, in honor of his work, the American Academy in Rome named Chalfin a fellow. Vizcaya In 1910 Chalfin began his most notable and successful project collaborating with F. Burrall Hoffman on the landmark Villa Vizcaya for the industrial magnate James Deering. Deering was an heir of the International Harvester fortune and had acquired substantial land on Biscayne Bay in present-day Miami, Florida. Chalfin was responsible for the choice of the general overall design of the main house and garden, and for decorating and furnishing the interior of the main house himself, while F. Burrall Hoffman was responsible for implementing Chalfin's stylistic choices by integrating them into and adapting them to his own designs of the house itself.Witold Rybczynski and Laurie Olin, authors, Steven Brooke, photographer. Vizcaya: An American Villa and Its Makers (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006). Chalfin would later claim mean- spiritedly and falsely in an article in the New York Times,Aline B. Louchheim, \\"Biscayne Bay's New Show Place,\\" The New York Times, March 15, 1953. that he designed everything at Vizcaya, saying that \\"Hoffman did the plumbing, I did the house.\\" Under threat of a lawsuit by Hoffman, the New York Times later published a retraction of that article, acknowledging that Hoffman was the architect who designed the house so as to realize Chalfin's overall stylistic choices and adding that it was actually Diego Suarez who designed the Gardens along Chalfin's ideas for it. In fact Chalfin, who had been chosen by Deering as a consultant on external style and interior decoration, was the one who had hired Hoffman in the first place, precisely because Chalfin knew that he himself was not an architect, and one would be required this new building project. The villa was completed for residency in 1916, and the formal gardens and acres of landscaped grounds completed in 1923. Later life Colonnade Building, 1926, Coral Gables, FL. With Walter De Garmo and Phineas Paist Despite high praise for his work on Villa Vizcaya, Chalfin never worked on another mansion.

Chalfin returned to Vizcaya in 1934 to consult on rehabilitation of the property after a major hurricane. In 1940 Chalfin retired due to failing eyesight. Paul Chalfin died on February 15, 1959 at the age of 84 in a nursing home in Upper Montclair, New Jersey.

Today his place is in Sumy Oblast while Zinkiv is a city in Poltava Oblast, both in Ukraine. He studied in elementary school in Zinkiv, later enrolling into the Kiev military-nursing school which he finished in 1907. He worked as a nurse in the Army and then at the surgical department of the South-Western Railways hospital. He finally managed to take the tests to enroll into the Kiev University in 1917, but later (1919) dropped out of it and was fully was overtaken by journalism and literary works. In 1919 he was captured by Bolsheviks while being in the Ukrainian Army and heavily sick of typhus. Remarkable is the fact that he also served as the chief of the medical- sanitary directorate of Ukrainian Ministry of Railways (Transport).

It is a major reservoir on the Challawa River, a tributary of the Kano River, which is the main tributary of the Hadejia River. Construction The Challawa Gorge reservoir project was started by the Water Resources and Engineering Construction Agency of the Kano State Government, and was later handed over to the Federal Government who funded the project. The dam is owned and operated by the Hadejia-Jama’are River Basin Development Authority, a Federal agency. The dam was built by Julius Berger Nigeria in 1990 - 1992 using rock fill construction. It is 42 m high and 7.8 km in length. The dam has a full storage capacity of 904,000,000 m3. The direct catchment area is 3857 km2. Hydro power potential The dam was designed with the potential for hydro power generation in mind, and may have a capacity of 3MW on average - more in the rainy season and less in dry season. However, power would cost considerably more to deliver than current retail prices, and it is not clear how a project to install the generating equipment would be financed. Issues The soil in the immediate catchments of the dam has not been stabilized, so the reservoir may be silting up. Silt is also being deposited in the Challawa River, affecting the intake structures of Kano City Water Supply. The dam has disrupted the natural balance along the river. Upstream areas are now subject to flooding while downstream riverine wetlands and croplands have dried out. A 2002 study noted that while the dam was intended to support irrigation projects, none had been started, although much farmland had been covered by the dam. The water was being used only to supply Kano city. The Challawa dam and the nearby Tiga Dam have also had adverse effects on the downstream Hadejia-Nguru wetlands. Several studies have shown that these dams have delivered negative economic value when their effect on downstream communities was taken into account.

Author's Introduction. P. x . State University of New York, Albany, 2014 The strategy employed by Montes-Bradley when it comes to Borges, a writer of whom almost everything has been said, consists on giving the word to the writer himself and to a select group of intellectuals who dwell on the margins of the Argentine cultural aparatik. Montes-Bradley, however, does not exhibit Borges like a painting to be admired but rather as a counterpoint to the observations of others. We are neither the hapless witnesses of another saccharine celebration of Jorge Luis Borges, nor are we forced to endure another fashionable defrocking of an idol. The Borges that emerges from the interaction of the testimonies in this documentary surges from the heat of the debate, from the strong opinions, some certainly scandalous, most politically incorrect. On the tenth anniversary of its theatrical release, Montes-Bradley writes an opinion column on Diario Clarín with considerations about the film in retrospective.Montes-Bradley, Eduardo. \\"Harto the Borges: diez años después\\".

The first Japanese explorers arrived in the Marshall Islands in the late 19th century, although permanent settlements were not established until the 1920s. As compared to other Micronesian islands in the South Seas Mandate, there were fewer Japanese who settled in the islands. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Japanese populace were repatriated to Japan, although people of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage remained behind. They form a sizeable minority in the Marshall Islands' populace, and are well represented in the corporate, public and political sectors in the country.Crocombe (2007), p. 103 History=Early contact (19th century) The earliest Japanese contact with the Marshall Islands dates back to 1884, when a group of pearl divers were blown off course to Lae Atoll during their return voyage from Australia. The pearl divers were believed to be murdered, after the Ada, a British trading ship sailed past the Marshall Islands and found the skeletal remains of the pearl divers.Peattie (1988), p. 9 When news of the purported murder reached the Japanese government, two Japanese envoys–Goto Taketaro (a son of Goto Shojiro) and Suzuki Tsunenori were sent to the Marshall Islands. The envoys reportedly explored some of the nearby atolls before paying a visit to Labon Kabua, one of the principal chief in the Marshall Islands. Before Goto and Suzuki returned for Japan, they induced Kabua to raise the Japanese flag over his house at Ailinglaplap. The Japanese government subsequently ordered the two envoys to return to the island to haul down the flag upon the envoys' return.Peattie (1988), p. 10–12 During the German colonial era, there were occasional reports of Japanese fishermen making landfalls in the atoll, and there was at least one other incident which Japanese fishermen were also killed by the islanders. A report published by a German explorer, Hambruch in 1915 mentioned that three Japanese fishermen in a junk were massacred by the Marshallese at Lae Atoll in 1910.Tobin (2002), p. 121 Japanese administration (1914–1944) A military administration was established when Japan annexed the Marshall Islands from Germany in 1914. The Japanese government subsequently dispatched a few administrators to the Marshall Islands. Between 1915 and 1918, a few Japanese businessmen from the South Seas Trading Company (Nanyo Boeki) sailed to the Marshall Islands and established a few trading stations at Rongrong, Talab and Majuro village. A typhoon struck Majuro in 1918 and the businessmen relocated their trading posts to Jaluit.Spoehr (1949), p. 37 The civilian administration was established at Jabat Island and replaced the military administration in 1922. A small branch government office was established; and local Japanese settlers opened a small copra plantation on the island.Peattie (1988), p. 186 In the early 1920s, a Japanese trader settled in Enewetak and made false claims that he had received permission from the government to develop coconut groves. The natives initially worked for the trader, but resisted after realising the trader's false claims. There was no permanent official at Enewetak and Ujelang, but a ship from Pohnpei would make occasional visits to the islands.Devaney (1987), p. 20 Japanese traders avoided Majuro until 1926, although Japanese ships made occasional stops on the atoll. A Japanese sailor settled on Majuro and started a store in 1926, and throughout the 1930s three more independent enterprises sprung up while two trading companies–Nanyo Boeki and Kaneko each established a branch store in Majuro village. The number of Japanese enterprises remained small throughout the Japanese colonial era, as the civilian administration experienced difficulties in acquiring unused land from the Marshallese chiefs.Hezel (2003), p. 190 The first Okinawan fishermen arrived in Jaluit in the 1920s, and Jaluit experienced a steady influx of Japanese settlers from Kyushu and OkinawaVisualizing Japan’s Pacific Past, Greg Dvorak, The Australian National University: Centre for Cross-Cultural Research, 2 July 2007 from 1930s onwards. In the early 1930s, Marshallese reported a strong presence of Japanese and Korean labourers in Jaluit who were hired to build roads and shophouses.Poyer et al. (2008), p. 53 The regional headquarters was relocated to Jaluit from Jabat. Jaluit developed into a small town by 1939, and housed a population of several hundred Japanese settlers along with some two thousand Marshallese in the suburban areas.Connell (2002), p. 24 The Japanese navy developed military bases in the atolls in the early years of World War II.Spoehr (1949), p. 33 During this time, the military brought in several thousand Japanese, Okinawan and Korean labourers to undertake the construction of military facilities.Hezel (2003), p. 218–220 Some Marshallese and Koreans reported of maltreatment by the Japanese authorities, and there was at least one case of revolt by both groups at Jelbon on Mili Atoll in which a hundred Japanese civilians and soldiers were killed.Poyer et al. (2008), p. 154–5 When American troops attacked the Marshall Islands between January and April 1944, Japanese troops evacuated many Japanese settlers and Korean labourers from the atolls. A few were reportedly killed in the ensuing air raids, while others who remained behind were captured as Prisoners of warChristiansen (1994), p. 27 after the Americans captured the atolls, together with some Japanese soldiers.Peattie (1988), p. 271 Recent years (1945–present) After the Japanese surrender, the Japanese population on the islands was repatriated back to Japan. People of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage generally stayed behind, although a few were granted an option if they were above 16 years old.Komai (2001), p. 32 The Japanese–Marshallese quickly assimilated with the Marshallese in the years after the war. Many of them became politicians and businessmen, and in the 1970s people of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage controlled most of the private enterprises in the state.Porter et al. (1983), p. 144 Japanese–Marshallese politicians generally held critical opinions on nuclear weapon tests carried out by the United States in Operation Crossroads. At least one ethnologist, Greg Dvorak suggested that the shared Japanese and Marshallese experience of nuclear warfare shaped critical views held by Japanese–Marshallese politicians. From the 1990s onwards, Japanese–Marshallese politicians including James Matayoshi and Hiroshi Yamamura often led lobbies against the United States for monetary compensation of victims of radioactive fallout.Pacific Islands Monthly: PIM., Volume 68 (1998), p. 12 When Marshall Islands became independent in 1986, second and third-generation Japanese–Marshallese offspring formed the Japanese–Marshallese association (also known as Marshall Nikkeijin Kai in Japanese), and rendered assistance to families of Japanese soldiers who died during the Pacific War. Although the association had limited patronage from the younger generation of Japanese–Marshallese, it played an important role in lobbying the government to forge closer cultural and economic ties with Japan.旧南洋群島における混血児のアソシエーションーパラオ ･サクラ会, Iitaka Shingo, University of the Ryukyus Repository. Retrieved October 17, 2009. Japanese firms that were based on the Marshall Islands since the 1960s actively sought joint ventures with local companies from the 1980s onwards, mainly in the fishery sector. Expatriates usually consisted of Okinawan fishermen based at Majuro, where Japanese companies have built smoking and canning facilities to facilitate the processing of tuna catches.Doulman (1987), p. 7 Demographics=Population The Marshall Islands remained sparsely populated by Japanese settlers, relative to the other mandated Micronesian islands. The first pre- war census of the Marshall Islands counted 490 Japanese among 10,000 Marshallese,Rottman (2004), p. 12 and the number of Japanese settlers increased to 680Poyer et al. (2001), p. 24 scattered across all 33 atolls in 1940. Within the same year, the mandated islands had a total Japanese population of 77,000.Peattie (1988), p. 160 The largest towns in the Marshall Islands, Jaluit and Jabor, had a thousand Japanese each, while in the most isolated atolls, the Japanese populace amounted to no more than a few individuals.Peattie (1988), p. 186, 188 Korean labourers were also counted recognised as Japanese in official statistics,Peattie (1988), p. 220 and accounted for another 1,200 individuals which were brought into the Marshall Islands during the war. There was a sizeable minority of people of mixed Japanese and Marshallese heritage, which was more common in settlements with a smaller Japanese populace. In official census, people of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage are identified by their Marshallese heritage from 1945 onwards.Spoehr (1949), p. 60 The Marshallese ambassador to the United States, Banny de Brum cited in 2006 that some 6,000 individuals, or about 10% of all Marshall Islanders had some Japanese ancestry.Pacific Islands President, Bainbridge Lawmakers Find Common Ground (Copy ), June 10, 2006, Kitsap Sun, Rachel Pritchett. Retrieved October 4, 2009. Language Japanese was extensively used for day-to-day communication during the colonial era by both Japanese and Marshallese, but was replaced by Marshallese after the Japanese surrender. Japanese is still preferred as a second language over English among those of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage, and islanders occasionally adopt Japanese loanwords for certain terms in the Marshallese language.McMurray et al. (2001), p. 57 Religion At least one Shinto shrine or Buddhist temple was found in each settlement with a sizeable Japanese populace. In Jaluit, Wotje, Kwajalein, Enewetak and Maloelap, several Shinto shrines were built during the 1930s. When the Americans invaded the Marshall Islands in 1944, all the existing Shinto shrines were either destroyed in air raids, or were demolished.Trumbull (1959), p. 109 People of mixed Japanese–Marshallese heritage subsequently adopted Christianity in favour of Buddhism or Shinto after the Japanese surrender. Interethnic relations in society As compared to other Micronesian islands, most Marshallese adopted Japanese customs within the first few years of the Japanese administration. An Australian journalist travelling on a Burns Philp steamer noted that the most Marshallese women wore the kimono instead of the traditional loincloth (lavalava in Marshallese) in October 1918.Hiery (1995), p. 138 Interethnic relations between the Japanese settlers and civil servants with the Marshallese were friendly, but racial segregation was enforced between Japanese and Micronesians in the workforce and educational sectors. As compared to Micronesians from other islands, Marshallese generally retained more aspects of their traditional lifestyles, relative to the small Japanese populace in the islands.Petrosian-Husa (2004), p. 12 Contrary to Japanese settlements in the other mandated islands, settlers consisted mainly of single men, and intermarriages with Marshallese women were much more frequent. Japanese songs such as Masaharu Gunto were written in the 1930s and reflected of romantic associations between Japanese men and Marshallese women. Ethnic suspicion and hatred by the Marshallese against the Japanese settlers developed during the Second World War, as the Japanese civilian government placed increased emphasis on militarism and forcibly conscripted many Marshallese to menial labour during the Second World War.Poyer et al. (2001), p. 200 Shortly before the end of the war, a few Marshallese led independent and isolated attacks against Japanese military personnel wherever possible.Poyer et al.

Much of her art is informed by this practice, and engages with the themes of ritual, motherhood and femininity, expressed through the highly stylized posing of her body, which is placed in relation to personally and ritually significant objects in her self-portraits. Education Pérez Bravo initially studied painting in Havana at the San Alejandro Academy of Fine Arts (1979) and the Instituto Superior de Arte (1984). Although she studied painting while at the Instituto Superior de Arte, she became interested in photography while working on her senior thesis at the latter, and has primarily used this medium since. She lived in Havana until 1995 when she moved to Monterrey, Mexico, with her family, where she currently resides and works. Pérez Bravo was part of a generation of Cuban artists born immediately following the Cuban Revolution and was one of those who went into exile following the collapse of the Special Period at the end of the 1980s.Martín-Sevillano, Ana Belén. \\"Crisscrossing Gender, Ethnicity, and Race: African Religious Legacy in Cuban Contemporary Women's Art.\\" Cuban Studies 42 (2011): 136-54. Work Pérez Bravo's work is usually staged, small-format black-and-white photographs where she uses her body as a vessel to express her cultural and religious perspective. She is deeply connected to her cultural background, especially the religious belief of the Afro-Caribbean Santería. The Santería believe that the divine exists in all things, even in everyday objects. These objects are often \\"votive offerings and other elements of popular lore\\" Marta María Pérez Bravo\\" , Dalton Gallery. Retrieved 11 April 2013. of her Cuban culture. This is why Pérez Bravo chooses such familiar objects such as rope, branches, and animal parts to express the divine nature of all things. Her photographs attempt to express her own spiritual path, documenting her progress through abstract and dream-like staged photographs. Although her spiritual path itself remains vague, we are given a glimpse into her divine experiences. This is done primarily by her transformation of her own body alternatively into an altar or an offering, or a vehicle for sacred meaning. There is an emphasis on the exploration and performance of both spiritual and physical power in Pérez Bravo’s self-portraiture, which together “remythify” the female body and notions of femininity.Amador Gómez-Quintero, Raysa Elena, and Mireya Pérez Bustillo. 2002. The female body: perspectives of Latin American artists. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Her photos are often grounded in her own lived experiences of worship and womanhood, especially the expression of maternity, desire and death, which she expresses through manipulation and presentation of her physical body.Tejo, Carlos. “Marta María Pérez Bravo: El Culto a Lo Cotidiano.” Bellas Artes 3 (2005): 39-62. For example, a large part of her work also consists of self-portraits that are intended to \\"demystify\\" motherhood. Her challenges in childbirth served as the inspiration for her series Para concebir (To conceive) (1985) and Memories of Our Baby (1990). These series attempt to demystify motherhood by showing her body in ways that are intended to challenge the worshiping of sensual beauty. One method she uses to accomplish this is to depict her body in circumstances of physical violence. Her practice of Santeria, which emphasizes duality, allows for the existence of this contextualized violence and spirituality in the same image, while also transforming Pérez Bravo’s body into a sacred site in and of itself.Schultz, Stacy E. \\"Latina identity: reconciling ritual, culture, and belonging.\\" Woman's Art Journal, vol. 29, no. 1 (2008): 13-20. Her photographs explore what it means to be female contrary to patriarchal stereotypes. Pérez Bravo's work has immense personal meaning, reflecting as it does her life and beliefs, but has also been interpreted as having a broader significance. Her portraiture, for its extensive use of Afro-Caribbean religious symbols, has been viewed as a protest against the marginalization or folklorization of Afro-Cuban traditions, done through the artist's exploration of her own identity in depictions of her literally embodied experiences of race, gender, and ethnicity. Peréz Bravo's exploration of identity challenges notions of colonialism, racism, and patriarchal authority as she attempts to combine the social, political, cultural, historical, and popular aspects of her own personal experiences in her portraiture. Bravo's work has been displayed all over the world including Cuba at the IV Havana Bienal, the V Istanbul Biennial in Turkey and the Kwangju Biennale in South Korea. Her work has been also included in many museum exhibitions such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Museo del Barrio, New York, Museum of Contemporary Art, Brisbane, Australia, Museum Fridericianum, Kassel, Germany, Muesarnok Museum, Budapest, Hungary, Alejandro Otero Museum of Visual Arts, Caracas, Venezuela, Winnipeg Art Gallery and the National Art Gallery in Ottawa, Canada, Menil Collection in Houston, Louisiana Museum for Moderne Kunst, Copenhagen, Denmark, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, Wichita Art Museum, Kansas, Museum of Fine Arts, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Mead Museum of Art, Amherst, Massachusetts, Miami Art Museum, Florida, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Samuel P.

The first bibliographical indication of Antonietta Brandeis dates from her teens, when she is mentioned as a pupil of the Czech artist Karel Javůrek of Prague. After the death of Brandeis' father, her mother, Giuseppina Dravhozvall, married the Venetian Giovanni Nobile Scaramella; shortly afterward the family apparently moved to Venice. In the 1867 registry of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts, Brandeis is listed as being enrolled as an art student. At this time, Brandeis would have been nineteen, and one of the first females to receive academic instruction in the fine arts in Italy. In fact, the Ministry granted women the legal right to instruction in the fine arts only in 1875, by which time Brandeis had finished her education at the Academy.  Teachers  Brandeis’s professors at the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts include Michelangelo Grigoletti and Napoleone Nani for life drawing, Domenico Bresolin for landscape, Pompeo Marino Molmenti for painting and Federico Moja for perspective. Already during her first years of study there is evidence of Brandeis' skill-in her first year she is awarded prizes and honors in Perspective and Life Drawing. Brandeis’ continuing excellence and diligence in her artistic studies during the five years she spends at the Academy is attested to in the lists of prize-winning students of the Academy “Elenco alunni premiati Accademia Venezia in Atti della Reale Accademia di Belle Arti in Venezia degli anni 1866-1872”. It includes numerous mentions of prizes and high honours won by Brandeis in Art History, Perspective, Life Drawing, Landscape and Anatomical Drawing, Drawing of Sculpture, and “Class of Folds”.  Venice  The Ponte di Rialto, Venice It is in Venice at the Academy that Brandeis perfected her skills as a meticulous landscape and cityscape painter, with intricate and luminous details in the tradition of the eighteenth-century “vedutisti”. In 1870, while still a student at the Academy, she participated in her first exhibition; that of the Società Veneta Promotrice di Belle Arti with the oil painting Cascina della Madonna di Monte Varese. She is documented as having exhibited eight paintings during the years 1872 to 1876 with the Società Veneta Promotrice di Belle Arti, both landscapes and genre scenes. In the exhibit of 1875 her landscape Palazzo, Marin Falier is sold to M. Hall of London for 320 lire, a first indication of the success Brandeis will achieve with foreign collectors of her work (particularly the English and German visitors to Italy on the Grand Tour circuit). During these same years, she showed two paintings in the Florentine exhibit Promotrice Fiorentina. The first painting, entitled “Gondola” is a subject which she repeats in new variations throughout her career with great success. The second, perhaps a genre painting, is entitled “Buon dì !” The two paintings remained unsold and were presented at the same exhibition the following year, together with two more genre scene paintings. In 1876 and 1877 she exhibited three landscapes of Venice at the Promotrice Veneta, which sold to foreign collectors. In November 1877 Brandeis showed the large painting Palazzo Cavalli a Venezia at the exhibition of the Hungarian Fine Arts Society in Budapest. In both Florence and Budapest, Brandeis showed her work under the name “Antonio Brandeis”. The biographer De Gubernatis offers the following explanation for the change of name: “her first pictures received praise and criticism; she took the criticism, but when she was praised as a woman she was annoyed, and therefore exhibited under the name Antonio Brandeis.” During the years 1878 to 1893 Brandeis painted and exhibited numerous works, primarily scenes of Venice, and although she resided chiefly in that city she also traveled and painted in Verona, Bologna, Florence, and Rome. As well as in Venice and Florence, she exhibited in Turin, Milan, and Rome. In 1880 she was present at the International Exposition of Melbourne with three paintings: Palazzo Cavalli, A Balcony in Venice and The Buranella- native of Burano Island near Venice. Baptismal Font at Saint Mark's Basilica Brandeis was a prolific painter, and often replicated her most popular subjects with only slight variations. She was represented in Venice at the photographer Naya’s studios in Piazza San Marco and in Campo San Maurizio and in Florence she collaborated with the picture dealer Giovanni Masini. During this period of intense activity painting landscapes en plein air and genre scenes, Brandeis also is documented in De Gubernatis as a painter of religious altarpieces. Several of these altarpieces can be found on the Island of Korcula in Croatia. Two are visible in the parish church of Smokvici and of in the church of St. Vitus in Blato. In the sacristy of the Cathedral of Korcula is a Madonna with Christ Child painted by Brandeis. For the same church she also painted a copy of the central panel of Giovanni Bellini’s triptych from the Venetian Church of Santa Maria dei Frari Gloriosa (1488). In 1899, for the main altar of the chapel of St. Luke in the Korcula town cemetery, Brandeis painted a St. Luke, which shows the sparkling colors and free impasto typical of her plein air oil paintings. On October 27th 1897 at the age of 49, Brandeis married the Venetian Antonio Zamboni, a knight and officer of the Italian Crown and knight of the Order of SS. Maurizio and Lazzaro. The couple continued to reside in Venice and Brandeis continued to show at Italian exhibitions in Venice, Florence, and Rome although more sporadically and with fewer works than before. Although she participated in the International Exposition of Watercolourists in Rome in 1906 with a “Study” and in the Società Promotrice delle Belle Arti in Florence in 1907 and 1908 with two oil paintings, De Gubernatis quotes Brandeis as saying in 1906, that even though she resides in Venice “I am a foreigner, and for some time I have not taken part in Italian Exhibitions, sending all my paintings to London. Antonio Zamboni died 11 March 1909 and from then on, Brandeis resided primarily in her Florentine home on Via Mannelli, continuing to paint in her studio there until her death on March 20th 1926.  Legacy  According to her last will and testament, dated 1 January 1922, and preserved in the archives of the Innocenti Foundling Hospital in Florence, Brandeis left the bulk of her worldly goods to the orphanage, including her sketchbooks and her works of art still in her possession, except for four paintings, for which she left money to be well framed and given to the Modern Art Gallery of the Pitti Palace. Laura Capella, daughter of her dear friend and fellow artist Giulia Capella, painted the portrait of Brandeis in 1924 which hangs in the Benefactors Room of the Innocenti Institute. Most of Brandeis' belongings, including her artworks, were sold at public auction in December of 1926, but the Innocenti Institute still conserves at least twelve of her oil paintings, as well as numerous watercolors and sketchbooks, which provide much information about the artists painting technique. As well as at the Innocenti Institute and the Gallery of Modern Art at the Pitti Palace in Florence, Antonietta Brandeis’ works are in private collections in many parts of the world. Her works can also be found at the University of Virginia Art Museum, the Gloucester City Museum and Art Gallery, the Revoltella Museum in Trieste, and on the island of Korcula, Croatia (in the chapel of St. Luke in the Korcula town cemetery, the Cathedral of Korcula, St. Vitus Church in Blato and the parish church of Smokvica).  Exhibitions  *July 2012 to 28 October 2012, Florence Through the Artists’ Eyes, From Signorini to Rosai, exhibit at the Pitti Palace Exhibit, Gallery of Modern Art, 7th “The Niobe Room at the Uffizi” by Antonietta Brandeis. One of four paintings donated to the Pitti Palace by the artist at her death in 1926, this small oil on cardboard (29 x 35 cm.) depicts a female artist engaged in painting from life in the Room of the Niobe, one of the most famous rooms of the Uffizi Gallery. The painting is an extremely faithful depiction of the arrangement of the room at the time, as evidenced by a period photograph in the archives of the City of Florence. Indeed, the artist probably spent time in the Uffizi executing copies herself. *13–21 February 2010 Antonietta Brandeis (1848-1926)Vedute dell’Ottocento al femminile.

The fruit bodies of this saprobic fungus are small blackish cups, typically up to broad, that grow in groups on soil, often amongst pine needles and short grass near coniferous trees. Pseudoplectania nigrella has a worldwide distribution, and has been found in North America, the Caribbean, Britain, Europe, India, Madagascar, New Zealand, and Japan. The fungus produces a unique chemical compound, plectasin, that has attracted research interest for its ability to inhibit the growth of the common human pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. Taxonomy and naming Christian Hendrik Persoon named the species Peziza nigrella in his Systema Mycologia in 1801, and it was sanctioned under this name in Elias Magnus Fries' Systema Mycologicum in 1821. In 1870, German mycologist Fuckel transferred it to his newly described genus Pseudoplectania, and made it the type species. The species was ulteriorly placed in Crouania by Friedrich August Hazslinszky von Hazslin, and in Plectania by Petter Karsten (1885), but neither placement is considered correct. The fungus is commonly known as the \\"ebony cup\\", the \\"black false plectania\\", or the \\"hairy black cup\\". Description The fruit bodies (technically called apothecia) typically grow in groups, or sometimes crowded closely together, with small stems or missing them entirely. Initially, the fruit bodies are closed and roughly spherical, but as they develop they expand to become cup-shaped, or almost flat. The inner surface of the cups bear the reproductive spore-bearing layer, or hymenium; it is brownish-black, with an edge that is often wavy and curved slightly inwards, and covered with fine hairs. The cups may reach up to in diameter. The hairs are long but usually closely coiled and twisted, which gives to the exterior of the cup a slightly tomentose appearance of nearly uniform thickness throughout their entire length. They are pale brown and 4–6 µm in diameter. thumb The asci are roughly cylindrical with a long stem-like base; the entire ascus is often as long as 300–325 µm and about 15 µm in diameter at the thickest point. The spores are round, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and have diameters of about 12–14 µm. They are filled with many small oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae in the hymenium) are enlarged at their tips and filled with brown colored matter, about 4 µm thick. Similar species Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P. nigrella, but has a more deeply and persistently cup-shaped fruit body, a short but distinct stem, and only grows amongst sphagnum moss. Plectania melastoma has elliptical to spindle-shaped spores measuring 20–28 by 8–12 µm, while P. milleri has elliptical spores, and the margin of its cups have star-shaped points. Edibility Pseudoplectania nigrella is considered inedible. It has no distinctive taste or odor. Habitat and distribution This species is saprobic, and is found growing in groups on the ground or on moss-covered decaying wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. Its small size and dark color makes it easy to overlook. Pseudoplectania nigrella has a worldwide distribution, and has been found in North America, the Caribbean, Europe, India, Madagascar, New Zealand, Israel, and Japan. Bioactive compounds alt=Cartoon representation of the secondary structure of plectasin. Defensins are antibiotics made from peptides and are typically found in animals and higher plants. Plectasin, found in Pseudoplectania nigrella, is the first defensin to be isolated from a fungus. Plectasin has a chemical structure resembling defensins found in spiders, scorpions, dragonflies and mussels. In general, defensins have commonalities in their molecular structure, such as cysteines in the peptide stabilized with disulfide bonds. In particular, defensins from P. nigrella, invertebrates, and plants and share a conformation that has been named the CSαβ motif. In laboratory tests, plectasin was especially active in inhibiting the growth of the common human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. Plectasin has a low toxicity in mice, and cured them of peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae as efficiently as vancomycin and penicillin, suggesting that it may have therapeutic potential. In 2010, Chinese scientists announced a method for high-level production of plectasin using transgenic E. coli.

Listed at , 175 lb., he batted and threw right-handed. A native of Hamtramck, Michigan, Kazanski was a classic slick fielder, slap-hitter, who used the entire field to his advantage. One of the most highly rated schoolboy ballplayers of his time, he was given a reported $100,000 bonus to sign with the Phillies in 1951. He spent two and a half seasons in the Philadelphia Minor League system before joining the big club in the 1953 midseason, at nineteen years of age. In his majors debut, Kazanski went 3-for-6 and drove in four runs from the top of the order, to lead the Phillies to a 13–2 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Kazanski became the first player since – the first season runs batted in was recorded as an official statistic – to drive in at least four runs as a shortstop in his major league debut, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He finished the season with a .217 batting average in 95 games. In 1954 Kazanski was relegated to backup and platoon infield duties, splitting time with Bobby Morgan and Granny Hamner. He spent most of 1955 at Triple-A. His most productive season came in 1956, when he posted career-highs in games (117), home runs (4), RBI (34) and hits (80), while hitting .211. In that season, he belted a three-run home run (on April 22 ) and an inside-the-park grand slam (on August 8), to provide two of the 19 victories of Phillies pitching ace Robin Roberts. He also started a triple play in the same game as his inside the park grand slam, a feat that would not be duplicated until Ángel Pagán did so on May 19, 2010 From 1957 to 1958, he divided his playing time between Triple-A and the Phillies. In a six-season majors career, Kazanski was a .217 hitter (288-for-1329) with 14 home runs and 116 in 417 games, including 118 runs, 49 doubles, nine triples and four stolen bases. In 1959, Kazanski was sent by Philadelphia along with Stan Lopata to the Milwaukee Braves in the same transaction that brought Gene Conley, Harry Hanebrink and Joe Koppe to the Phillies. He played in the Braves minor league system until 1963, when was traded to Detroit in exchange for Ozzie Virgil. Kazanski also saw action in the minors with the Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Los Angeles Angels, Washington Senators and New York Yankees organizations, hitting .253 with 70 home runs and 244 RBI in 1183 games until he retired after the 1964 season. He was through by the age of thirty years. Following his playing career, Kazanski coached in the Detroit Tigers organization and also worked as an assistant for the baseball team at the University of Detroit Mercy, which he attended.

History The Protestant Children's Home was built for the Protestant Orphan Asylum Society, established on December 2, 1839 by women of various Protestant denominations for the care of Protestant children without parents. The yellow fever epidemics of 1837 and 1839 had created the need for an organization to care for the many orphaned children left afterward. Mobile during this time was a predominantly Roman Catholic city, with a Catholic orphanage and other support organizations already functional. Originally accepting children up to ten years old, the Protestant Orphan Asylum Society later accepted girls up to 18 years old and boys up to 14 years old. Design Designed by Henry Moffatt, a Philadelphia architect, the cornerstone for the orphanage was laid on July 4, 1845. The three-story brick structure is designed in a Late Federal style. Built on a central hall plan, the main block features two primary floors above a full-height ground floor. The front facade is five bays wide, with a two- story cast iron portico centered on the middle three bays. The upper tier of the portico features an elaborate ironwork balustrade and latticework. Minor alterations were made to the building during the late 19th century, the rear portion was expanded in 1924, and a full-scale renovation was completed in 1950.

The king, of South Indian ancestry, faced powerful opposition from the Sinhalese chieftains who sought to limit his power. A successful coup was organized by the chieftains, marking the end of 2358 years of self-rule on the island and resulting in the imprisonment of the king in Vellore. The treaty is quite unique in that it was not signed by the monarch on the throne but by members of his court and other dignitaries of the kingdom. The convention gained a degree of infamy when, according to apocryphal sources, Wariyapola Sri Sumangala, a Buddhist monk of the kingdom, seized and trampled a Union Jack hoisted by the British, demanding the flag of Kandy be left flying until the Convention was signed..

Jon's friend, Longtime Milwaukee Bucks Broadcaster Eddie Doucette, and his wife, Karen, had a son, Brett, who was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 2. Brett's diagnosis coincided with the timing of Jon's retirement. It was decided to use Jon's departure from professional basketball to announce the start of the MACC Fund. During a half-time on the floor of the Milwaukee Arena, the MACC Fund came into being. Members Jon McGlocklin was named the organization's President and Eddie was named Vice- President. Living in California since 1978, Eddie is the now the MACC Fund's Honorary Vice- President. Brett Doucette, the MACC Fund's first success story, is married and living in Arizona. His dad Eddie is working as a consultant with the NBA and Jon does color commentary for Bucks televised games with Honorary MACC Fund Athletic Board member, Jim Paschke. Local athletes, celebrities and community- minded business people comprised the Fund's original Board of Directors. All three groups are still involved. In addition, tens of thousands of people from throughout Wisconsin and the Midwest have embraced the MACC Fund and its mission to offer a special gift of \\"Hope Through Research to Children with Cancer and Related Blood Disorders.\\" On August 5, 2019, Becky Pinter was named president and CEO of the MACC Fund. Fund-raising and donations Fund- raising is based on the concept of \\"a good time for a good cause.\\" Special events led the way in the beginning and still comprise about 75% of the Fund's annual income. Brewers home runs and doubles, Packers sacks and interceptions and Bucks 3-point baskets and opening tips raised funds from generous sponsors and cooperative sports teams. Cause-related marketing programs with donations for each purchase followed suit along with a telethon called MACC*ATHON. Women for MACC took up the fight in 1982 with its own impressive fund-raising events. A yearly telethon/auction of signed and game-used sports memorabilia to benefit the fund on WTMJ-TV has been a staple of the holiday season since the late 1980s, along with the \\"MACC Star\\", a yearly Christmas ornament available for sale designed by a child currently undergoing cancer treatment. The MACC Fund's largest annual event is the Trek 100 Ride for Hope, which has raised over $8 million since 1990. Since 2009, the Trek 100 has been held in early June and begins and ends at the home of Trek Bicycle Corporation in Waterloo, Wisconsin. Riders raise at least $2 for each mile they ride, following routes that range from 19 to 100 miles. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers also raised $50k for the fund after winning Celebrity Jeopardy. Traditional donations, memorials, corporate and foundation support and estate planning gifts fill in the other 25% of the Fund's annual income. Total income in 2007 was $3.8 million. The MACC Fund has a full-time staff of 5 that coordinates year-round activities. The 10-year average administrative and indirect fund-raising expense is about 25%. The MACC Fund has contributed $33 million for pediatric cancer research thanks to the generosity and commitment of people who have taken the time to care for a child with cancer. This research impacts children throughout the country since the successful protocols become the standard for patient care everywhere. Long term commitments take the total to $39 million. The primary beneficiary of MACC Fund support is the MACC Fund Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, a collaborative effort of the Medical College of Wisconsin and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. Research is conducted in the 6-story MACC Fund Research Center of the Medical College of Wisconsin. The MACC Fund also supports research at the University of Wisconsin's Paul P. Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center where research will be conducted in the MACC Fund Pediatric Cancer Research Wing upon its completion in the fall of 2009. Translational research is supported at the MACC Fund Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. The MACC Fund committed nearly 1.5 million for the Midwest Children's Cancer Center's annual budget in fiscal 2008. This is about 30% of the Center's annual budget. In addition, support to the UW Cancer Center totaled $600,000 in 2008. The MACC Fund Scientific Review Board was formed in 1980 to review the work of the Midwest Children's Cancer Center and to review grants submitted from outside this Center. It is made up of leading pediatric oncology practitioners from around the country. The Board does a biennial site review of the Cancer Center. The current Review Board is headed by Dr. Kevin Shannon of the University of California, San Francisco Comprehensive Cancer Center. Past MACC Fund Scientific Review Board Chairs have come from prestigious medical schools such as Yale, Harvard, UCLA and The University of Southern California. The research that the MACC Fund supports has had a significant impact. The overall cure rate for all types of childhood cancer has risen from 20% to 80% in the past 30 years. Wilms tumor of the kidney is now 90% curable. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is about 85% curable. And the Midwest Children's Cancer Center has performed more successful non- related bone marrow transplants than any other Center in the country.

In 1905, David was selected for the Cardiff team to face the Original All Blacks, the very first touring New Zealand team.Billot (1972), pg 41. David began the move that created the second Cardiff try during the game,Billot (1972), pg 40. but fullback Bert Winfield missed the conversion in the final minutes, giving the All Blacks a narrow victory. In 1906, David faced his second touring side with Cardiff; Paul Roos' South Africans. Cardiff beat the tourists 17-0, the largest defeat for the South Africans that tour. The same season, David won his first and only Welsh cap, when he was chosen to face Ireland as part of the 1907 Home Nations Championship. The game began in controversy after the Welsh captain, Billy Trew, withdrew in protest to the treatment of suspended teammate Fred Scrine, by the Welsh Rugby Union. This left a space open at centre, which was taken by Bush, and to ensure club continuity David was brought in as his partner. The game ended in a record win over the Irish for Wales, but despite this the next season David was replaced by Newport's Tommy Vile. In December 1907 David switched to professional rugby league,Davies (1975), pg. 61 joining Wigan. He remained with Wigan for just the single season, and played his last game for them on 22 February 1908.

The relationship was independently discovered by the American statistician and astronomer Bert Woodard Rust and the Soviet astronomer Yury Pavlovich Pskovskii in the 1970s. They found that the faster the supernova faded from maximum light, the fainter its peak magnitude was. As a main parameter characterizing the light curve shape, Pskovskii used β, the mean rate of decline in photographic brightness from maximum light to the point at which the luminosity decline rate changes. β is measured in magnitudes per 100-day intervals. Selection of this parameter is justified by the fact that, at that time, the probability of discovering a supernova before the maximum light, and obtain the full light curve, was small. Moreover, the existing light curves were mostly incomplete. On the other hand, to determine the decline after the maximum light was rather simple for most observed supernovae. In the early 1980s CCD cameras appeared, and the number of SNe discoveries increased substantially. Moreover, the probability of discovering SNe before they reached maximum light and following their brightness evolution longer also increased. The first light curves of SNe Ia obtained using CCD photometry showed that some supernovae had faster decline rates than others. Later, the low luminosity Ia SN 1991bg with a fast decline rate was discovered. All this motivated the American astronomer Mark M. Phillips to revise this relationship precisely during the course of the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey. The correlation had been difficult to prove because Pskovskii's slope (β) parameter was difficult to measure with precision in practice, a necessary condition to prove the correlation. Rather than trying to determine the slope, Phillips used a simpler and more robust procedure that consisted in \\"measuring the total amount in magnitudes that the light curve decays from its peak brightness during some specified period following maximum light.\\" It was defined as the decline in the B-magnitude light curve from maximum light to the magnitude 15 days after B-maximum, a parameter he called \\\\Delta{m}_{15}. The lead sentence of the final paragraph of Phillips' paper acknowledges \\"I am indebted to George Jacoby for suggesting the \\\\Delta{m}_{15} parameter as an alternative to Pskovskii's β.\\" The relation states that the maximum intrinsic B-band magnitude is given by M_\\\\mathrm{max}(B) = -21.726 + 2.698 \\\\Delta m_{15} (B). Phillips dedicated the journal article confirming Yuri Pskovskii's proposed correlation to Pskovskii, who died a few weeks after Phillips' evidence confirming the relationship was published. It has been recast to include the evolution in multiple photometric bandpasses, with a significantly shallower slopeHamuy, M., Phillips, M. M., Maza, J., Suntzeff, N. B., Schommer, R.

Arthur \\"Al\\" Howie (September 16, 1945 – June 21, 2016) was a Canadian long-distance runner who won more than fifty marathons, ultramarathons, and multiday races in over two decades, including the 1991 Trans Canada Highway run (7295 kilometers) in the record time of 72 days and 10 hours. A brass plaque on Victoria's Mile Zero marker commemorates this athletic event for which he raised $750,000 for a fund for children with special needs. Two weeks after running across Canada he won the Sri Chinmoy 1300 Miler in New York improving on his own world record time.

He attended the local schools and completed his secondary education. He married an American living in Britain and a son Gabe was born in 1968. After his divorce, Howie immigrated to Canada with his son and settled in Toronto. A daughter, Dana, was born in 1976. He quit smoking in January 1974 and started running as a hobby \\"to get rid of the aggravation from quitting a three-pack-a-day smoking habit.\\" Howie moved to Victoria, B. C. in 1978 and began training for the long runs, including training runs between cities. He married Claudia Cole in 1986; they separated in 2000. He lived in Duncan, B. C., since 2005, where he received treatment for Diabetes I. Al Howie (in foreground) taking the lead to win his first marathon. 1982 Slave Lake Marathon, Alberta, Canada. The \\"Prince George to Boston\\" Marathon: 1979 The 1979 Prince George marathon will go down in sports history as the race that brought together three of Canada's unknown athletes for their inaugural marathon: Al Howie, Rick Hansen and Terry Fox. Howie had run from Victoria to Prince George to be in the race that promised the winner an all-expense-paid trip to the Boston Marathon. \\"Canadian ultrarunner's story to be revealed in new book\\". Canadian Running. July 4th, 2019. At the race, Rick Hansen easily rolled his wheelchair across the finish line ahead of all competitors. Al Howie placed third in his first run. And amputee Terry Fox was the last to finish the race only ten minutes behind the last two-legged runner encouraged by spontaneous applause from the watching crowd. Howie was inspired by Fox's announcement to run across Canada in aid of cancer research. \\"Fox unleashed a tremendous wave of energy and eagerness to excel, seldom seen in Canada on a personal level,\\" noted Howie. From Marathons to Ultramarathons to Multiday Races: 1980-1988 Howie began to train obsessively for longer and longer runs. He won his age group in his first full-length () marathon in 1980 in Edmonton. He then ran from Edmonton to Victoria to enter the first annual Royal Victoria Marathon in which he placed fourteenth overall. In May, 1981, Howie set the Canadian and North American record for the annual Self- Transcendence 24 Hour Race in Ottawa, and the following year improved on his distance by covering 150 miles and 395 yards in that continuous day and night (no sleeping) race. He won the annual 24-hour race in Ottawa five years in a row, in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1985. In 1983, he ran from Winnipeg to Ottawa prior to participating in the 24-hour event. In 1986 while he was recuperating from a bout with cancer, he ran his worst 24-hour ultra in which he covered about 100 kilometers. He was back in top form for the 1987 Canadian 24-hour Championship in Ottawa, winning the event for the sixth time. A cancerous brain tumour behind his ear appeared in the summer of 1985 forcing temporary withdrawal from all races. Adopting a macrobiotic diet, Howie had recovered sufficiently by spring of the following year to run 1200 kilometers from Victoria to Fernie in southern B.C. where some of his treatment had taken place. In 1987 he broke the record for the longest, continual run, completing 580 kilometers in 1422 laps around the University of Victoria's Centennial Stadium in 104.5 hours. That's 4 non-stop days and nights to promote the forthcoming Commonwealth Games. Beasley, Jared. \\"In Search of Al Howie\\". Rocky Mountain Books. 2019. In 1988, he set a record for the fastest run in the British End to End. Then he ran the length of Britain—1400 kilometers—in 11 days. A few months later, he ran from England through France to the island of Sardinia in Italy where he participated in another marathon. The Peak Years: 1989 to 1991 Howie after 1,300-mile race The 'Ultra Trio' was born in 1987—a set of three ultra races of 700, 1000 and 1,300 miles. (Sri Chinmoy Centre, History). No runners finished the 1300 Miler in New York in 1987 and 1988, but in 1989, Al Howie was the first person ever to complete the grueling Sri Chinmoy distance, setting the world record at 17 days and 9 hours. \\"Three Conquer the Sri Chinmoy 1,300 Miler\\". us.srichinmoyraces.org. He also set a world record for 2000 kilometres in the same race. Later that year, Howie set a record of for the 72-hour \\"Across the Years\\" race in Phoenix, Arizona, which doubles as the last ultra of one year and the first of the next, running from December 29, 1989, to New Year's Day, 1990. Across the Years Howie's longest and most famous run was in the summer of 1991 when he ran the entire length of the Trans Canada Highway from the Mile Zero sign in St. John's, Nfld, to Mile Zero in Victoria, B.C. covering the 7295.5 km in the record time of 72 days, 10 hours and 23 minutes. A brass plaque at Victoria's Mile Zero commemorates the event, and qualified him for the Guinness Book of Records. He had raised $750,000 for the Elks and Royal Purple Fund for children with special needs. \\"Al Howie was an eccentric ultramarathoner that ran across Canada\\". The Globe and Mail. July 1, 2016. Two weeks after his Trans Canada run, Howie was back in New York where he improved his own record time for the , completing the distance in 16 days and 19 hours, and earning him his second entry that summer in the Guinness Book of Records. His Sri Chinmoy running mates called him \\"the trans Canada crossing god.\\" \\"Lord of the Rings\\". us.srichinmoyraces.org. Battling Injuries and illness: 1985, 1992 – 1999Brain tumour= Howie's first solo attempt to cross Canada was in the summer of 1985. The route was from West to East via Prince Rupert and the Yellowhead Highway to Portage la Prairie, to Ottawa. It was part of Howie's North America running tour \\"to promote world peace and famine relief.\\" The run was halted dramatically in the Ottawa Valley when a malignant brain tumour appeared behind his right ear, triggering thoughts of dying. \\"Facing death, I realized the extent of my love for this life; I didn't want to die,\\" he wrote in a medical journal a year later. \\"Reluctant to submit to prescribed medical treatments of exploratory surgery, excision of the tumour and subsequent chemotherapy,\\" he searched and found alternate treatments, especially \\"the culinary adventure of macrobiotics,\\" a regimen of wholesome foods free of additives and preservatives, and shiatsu massage. As if miraculously, his illness reversed itself within months and he recommenced his training. In gratitude, he ran the 1200 kilometres from Victoria to the White Spruce Farm in Fernie, in southern B. C., where he had received some of his healing instruction and motivation. =Diabetes I= In 1992, the year after crossing Canada from east to west, Howie joined 28 other ultra-runners in a run across the United States. Not wearing proper inserts in his shoes while crossing the hot Mojave Desert in Arizona, he developed complications from blisters on his feet, forcing him to withdraw. It was this injury, he believes, that eventually led to the onset of Diabetes I, which, unfortunately, wasn't diagnosed for three years. He competed in the 1300 Miler in New York in 1993 but an inflamed nerve to his left knee forced him to withdraw after six days of running. By the summer of 1995, he had lost 30 lbs, his health was haywire, and \\"the pissing evil\\" had struck. \\"Type 1 diabetes was, until the discovery of insulin, a death sentence within two years,\\" he wrote later. \\"Death penalty commuted to life sentence of insulin injections,\\" Howie wrote after starting treatment. \\"Fighting back to life and health, this time via the more conventional method, the only way to go for insulin dependent diabetics—insulin therapy.\\" He attempted a running comeback in the 1996 Victoria 24-hour run, but could only muster 100 kilometres in the day and night run. Al made a couple of runs for the Victoria chapter of the Canadian Cancer Society in 1996, running the length of Vancouver Island for them. However, Howie refused to let his illness thwart his rigorous training regimen. \\"I'm back on the multi-day circuit, Novolin pens and a One Touch meter tossed into my sport bag with running shoes, orthotics and petroleum jelly. As with life generally, I am finding diabetes complicates racing yet accentuates the intrinsic adventure. More significantly my potential for success, even for record breaking in the grueling sport of ultra-marathon racing, is not to be compromised by my diabetic condition. Running toward the horizon of human endurance on synthetic insulin is exploring an uncharted universe. Rather than the runner's wall, hypoglycemia becomes the number one threat to be avoided. Once again I'm a pioneer in the aerobic universe, this time in the diabetic galaxy.\\" (Al Howie on the Come Back Trail, December 1997.) He was back on track again in 1997, winning the Victoria 24-hour race. By 1998 he felt he had regained ultra form and won four out of four ultras entered at distances from to 72 hours. His last race was the ultra 72-hour \\"Across the Years\\" event in Phoenix, Arizona, which started on December 29, 1998, and finished three days later on New Year's Day, 1999. Howie won the race. Coping with the disease for a decade and a half proved a formidable challenge. Howie was 46 when he ran across Canada. He resided in a residential and transitional care facility in Duncan, British Columbia, where he underwent treatment for diabetes. He died in June 2016.

His reputation as a poet, orator, and epigrammatist is supported only by contemporary report, and none of his works is known to have survived. Life He was of the family of Fowbery, of Fowberry Tower, Chatton, Northumberland. He graduated BA at Cambridge in 1515, and MA in 1517, having become a Fellow of Clare Hall in 1515. He took the higher degrees of BD in 1524, and DD at some point in Montpellier, France. He was preacher to the university in 1519, and was presented to a canonry and to the prebend of North Newbald in York Cathedral in March 1531. He was then presented to the rectory of Maidwell, Northamptonshire, on 20 February 1534. There is a long-standing theory that he was tutor to Henry FitzRoy, and Beverley Murphy in a recent biography of this illegitimate son of Henry VIII proposes that Folbury succeeded Richard Croke as tutor and remained until the boy was 12 in 1531, his subsequent preferment coming after this appointment which would have started in the late 1520s.Beverley A. Murphy, Bastard Prince: Henry VIII's Lost Son (2001), p. 80, p. 119 and p. 122. Folbury was elected master of Pembroke Hall in 1537, and died between 10 July and 10 November 1540. Among those taught by him was William Turner, elected Fellow of Pembroke in 1531.Eneas Mackenzie (editor), An historical, topographical, and descriptive view of the county of Northumberland, vol 2 (1825) p. 182.

The first phase of MHAS (waves 1 and 2) was supported by a grant from the MHAS was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (AG 18016, BJ Soldo, PI). The study was a collaborative effort among researchers from the Universities of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Wisconsin in the U.S., and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografia e Informática (INEGI, Mexico). The second phase of MHAS (waves 3 and 4) is supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (R01AG018016, R Wong, PI) and by the INEGI in Mexico. The new study is a collaborative effort from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografia e Informática (INEGI, Mexico), the University of Wisconsin, the Instituto Nacional de Geriatría (INGER, Mexico) and the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP, Mexico). Study goals The overall goal of the study is to examine the aging process and its disease and disability burden in a large representative panel of older Mexicans from a wide socioeconomic spectrum. The MHAS design was motivated by several research questions related to the dynamics of health and aging in Mexico; the effect on the multiple domains of health of early- and mid-life health behaviors, migration, transfers, and socioeconomic status; and health selectivity among migrants to the U.S. and among those returning to Mexico. Study description The MHAS includes a nationally representative sample of Mexicans 50 years and older and their spouses of partners regardless of age, and used protocols and survey instruments that are highly comparable to the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The baseline survey is a national representative survey of individuals born prior to 1951. The baseline survey was conducted in 2001, and a follow-up visit to the same individuals was conducted in 2003. The sample for the MHAS baseline was selected from residents of both rural and urban areas, from the National Employment survey (Encuesta Nacional de Empleo, ENE), carried out by the INEGI (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia) in Mexico; 11,000 households with at least one resident of age 50 or older were eligible to be part of the MHAS baseline sample. The baseline survey was conducted in the summer of 2001 with a sample size of 15,186 respondents. A direct interview was sought with each individual, and proxy interviews obtained when poor health or temporary absence precluded a direct interview. A follow-up survey was carried out in the summer of 2003; all age-eligible subjects from the 2001 wave were targeted even if they had moved. If the subject had died, an interview was conducted with an informed respondent. New spouses of respondents from 2001 were interviewed and included in the 2003 follow-up study, for a total of 14,250 interviews including 546 next-of-kin interviews. A follow-up visit was completed in 2012. In addition to a follow-up of the 2001 and 2003 respondents, the sample was refreshed by adding a representative sample of the population from the 1952-1962 birth cohorts, as well as their spouses/partners regardless of age. Similar to the baseline interview, the sampling frame for the new cohort sample was the Mexican National Employment and Occupation Survey (ENOE, previously named National Employment Survey, ENE) 2012. During the 2012 survey, 18,465 interviews were completed, including 2,742 next-of-kin interviews. The survey was conducted using a new CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview) system. Also new to the third wave of the study was the collection of a blood sample for biomarkers from a sub- sample (n=2,089) and questions on the occurrence of major life events of the respondents. The MHAS is a high quality study, with excellent response and follow-up rates. Response rates for waves in 2001, 2003 and 2012 were 91.8%, 93.3% and 88.1%, respectively. The next wave of the study is planned to be fielded in 2015. Study website The study website has a user-friendly environment that was designed to enhance the usability of and access to MHAS survey data and documentation. The platform is in both English (www.MHASweb.org and Spanish (www.ENASEM.org). Databases and study documents can be accessed from the website and include: • Questionnaires • Interviewer and Coder Manuals • Codebooks with variable codes and frequencies • Follow-up master file to link study subjects through the three waves • Fieldwork reports: duration of interviews, response rates The website also features a searchable database of publications using MHAS data and a discussion forum available to all users. The discussion forum can be used to facilitate research collaborations and share knowledge among users, including codes for constructing common variables. The database of publications is a non- exhaustive compilation of peer-reviewed publications, working papers, and other research documents using MHAS data. Survey contents Health Measures: Self-reports of conditions, symptoms, functional status, lifestyle behaviors (e.g., smoking and drinking history), use/source/costs of health care services, depression, pain, reading and cognitive performance tests; Background: Childhood health and living conditions, education, ability to read/write and count, migration history, marital history; Family: Rosters of all children (including deceased children); for each, demographic attributes, summary indicators of childhood and current health, education, current work status, migration. Parent and sibling migration experiences; Transfers: Financial and time help given to and received by respondent from children, indexed to specific child; time and financial help to parent; Economic: Sources and amounts of income, including wages, pensions, and government subsidies; type and value of assets. All non-response in amount questions were followed by bracketed amounts to reduce non-response; Housing Environment: Type, location, building materials, other indicators of quality, and ownership of consumer durables; Anthropometric: Interviewers measured weight, height; waist, hip, and calf circumference, knee length, and timed one-leg stands for a random subsample (20%) of respondents. Biomarkers (included in 2012): C-reactive protein, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), vitamin D, hemoglobin, HbAlc (using Ac1 Now); Performance Measures (included in 2012): Walking speed, grip strength, and balance. Publications Publications using the MHAS data cover a broad range of disciplines, including demography, microeconomics, labor economics, public health, epidemiology and health care policy. Published papers have appeared in diverse peer reviewed journals of multiple disciplines related to aging and health, both in the U.S. and abroad.

During the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, the Provisional Government assigned him as commissioner of Buzău County. On 8 September, he corresponded with his brother, a leader of the revolution, and took part in the public burning of Regulamentul Organic. He was arrested in Bucharest and subsequently departed for Ottoman- administered Constanța. In 1856, he was part of the Bucharest magistrates' corps. He belonged to the Bucharest Court of Appeals from 1859 to 1864, and was a lawyer in Craiova from 1864 to 1876. In 1870 he was inspector for private schools in Dolj County, and he served as Mayor of Craiova in 1875. His three daughters were renowned for their beauty: Olga, married to General Petre Gigurtu and the mother of Ion Gigurtu; Ana, married to Dr. Dimitrie Culcer; and Zoe, married to judge Nicolae Mandrea.

According to legend, a hunter killed a wild boar whose coat was snow-white from crystallised salt. The sow must have wallowed in a salt spring and so the first source of salt was discovered in Lüneburg about 800 years ago.  Operation  From the 12th century salt mining was the dominant feature of life in the town of Lüneburg. At that time, table salt was almost as valuable as gold and was measured in chors (1 chor = 554.32 kg), one chor being worth about 300 Reichsmarks. The saline was located between Sülzwiese and the hill of the Kalkberg. Its main entrance was on Lambertiplatz and the whole site was surrounded by thick walls and high towers. To assist in the transportation of salt, a canal and a crane were built on the Stint, a former smelt market by the harbour. The square known as Am Sande was uncobbled in medieval times and covered in sand, hence the name. It acted as a trading centre for the merchants and their wares, including salt.  Organisation  The centre of the saltworks was a salt spring (Sod) surrounded by 54 boiling huts (Siedehütten). The four boiling pans (Siedepfannen) in each hut, which were named after their first occupants, were supplied by channels and canals with brine. The brine was carried in buckets from the boiling chamber (Siedekammer) to ground level and then divided up between the 216 boiling pans. On the boiling site there was a salt stall (Salzbude) for selling small quantities of salt, as well as a tax office (Zollbude) responsible for handling tax and duty.  Property situation  The owners of the pans were called Sülzbegüterte (\\"salt gentry\\") and did not necessarily live in Lüneburg. They did not boil the brine themselves, but leased them to those with boiling rights living in Lüneburg. If such a Siedeberechtigter leased at least four pans, he became known as a Sülfmeister (\\"master salter\\") and had a claim to his own boiling hut. That said, a master salter was not allowed more than two huts i.e. eight pans. The lease amounted to one half of the revenue from the boiling pan. At the beginning of the 13th century the salt gentry were a mixture of clergymen and the nobility. Between 1250 and 1320, an increasing number of ordinary merchants became salt pan owners and there was a corresponding decrease in aristocratic salt gentry. In 1370 the number of merchants who owned pans was almost the same as the number of clergymen; a century later three-quarters of the pans belonged to the clergy, who were known as prelates. In addition to the salt gentry and salters there were also the Barmeister and the Sodmeister. The Barmeister was the foreman of the pan smithy (Bare) where the pans were cast. He was chosen by the master salters and the town council. The Sodmeister looked after the distribution of brine and was chosen by the salt owners and the town council.  Salt tax  The salt tax (Sülzhilfe) was a levy from the prelates to the council to defray the duty payable to the town. This meant that the clerical salt owners had to give up part of their brine income, initially a tenth part of every pfennig. The amount increased over the course of time to a quarter of a pfennig. Although by 1442 they paid one quarter of their income this still did not cover the duty levied by the town. For that reason from 1445, double tax was paid i.e. half of each pfennig had to be paid to the town council. This generated much distrust of the council especially from the Butenländischen and the Lüneburg provost, Scharper, and they refused to pay the sum demanded. This conflict flared up into the Lüneburg Prelates War.

Ramsay was the son of Robert Ramsay of Stirling and his wife Elizabeth Stirling. He was educated at Glasgow University and became a merchant in Glasgow. He was granted a lease in 1836 on the struggling Port Ellen whisky distillery on the island of Islay in the Inner Hebrides. He enlarged and improved the pier at Port Ellen in 1881 and became one of the pioneers of the export trade in Scotch whisky to the United States. He also inaugurated the first bi-weekly cargo and passenger service by steamship between Islay and Glasgow. He helped to improve the island's infrastructure and built Kildalton Castle, a rambling Scottish baronial country house in Port Ellen. He was a Deputy Lieutenant and a J.P. for Argyllshire and a J.P. for Lanarkshire and showed a major interest in education. In 1864 he was a member of the Royal Commission on Education in Scotland, being also an unpaid member of Board of Education for Scotland. He was a Fellow or member of several learned societies.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 In April 1868, Ramsay was elected at a by-election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stirling Burghs when his predecessor gave up the seat under the influence of a spiritualist prophet. He only sat until the general election in November that year, when he lost the seat to the future prime minister Henry Campbell- Bannerman. Ramsay was a member of the Royal Commission on Endowed Schools in Scotland in 1872. In the 1874 general election, he was elected as the MP for Falkirk Burghs, but discovering he had been in breach of regulations as he held a government contract at the time, stood down in March and was re-elected at a by-election that month. He held the seat until 1886, and in the meantime was a member of Endowed Institutions Commission under an Act of 1878, and of Educational Endowments Commission under an Act of 1882. Ramsay lived at Kildalton, Argyllshire. He died at the age of 78. Ramsay married firstly Eliza, Shields of Lanchester, Durham in 1857. She died in 1864, and he married again in 1871 to Lucy Martin of Auchendennan, Dumbarton.

While the most simplistic design is highly inefficient, advanced or hybrid implementations of free space bitmaps are used by some modern file systems. Example The simplest form of free space bitmap is a bit array, i.e. a block of bits. In this example, a zero would indicate a free sector, while a one indicates a sector in use. Each sector would be of fixed size. For explanatory purposes, we will use a 4 GiB hard drive with 4096 byte sectors, and assume the bitmap itself is stored elsewhere. The example disk would require 1,048,576 bits, one for each sector, or 1 MiB. Increasing the size of the drive will proportionately increase the size of the bitmap, while multiplying the sector size will produce a proportionate reduction. When the operating system (OS) needs to write a file, it will scan the bitmap until it finds enough free locations to fit the file. If a 12 KiB file were stored on the example drive, three zero bits would be found, changed to ones, and the data would be written across the three sectors represented by those bits. If the file were subsequently truncated down to 8 KiB, the final sector's bit would be set back to zero, indicating that it is again available for use. Advantages * Simple: Each bit directly corresponds to a sector * Fast random access allocation check: Checking if a sector is free is as simple as checking the corresponding bit * Fast deletion: Data need not be overwritten on delete; flipping the corresponding bit is sufficient * Fixed cost: Both an advantage and disadvantage. Other techniques to store free space information have a variable amount of overhead depending on the number and size of the free space extents. Bitmaps can never do as well as other techniques in their respective ideal circumstances, but don't suffer pathological cases either. Since the bitmap never grows, shrinks or moves, fewer lookups are required to find the desired information * Low storage overhead as a percentage of the drive size: Even with relatively small sector sizes, the storage space required for the bitmap is small. A 2 TiB drive could be fully represented with a mere 64 MiB bitmap. Disadvantages * Wasteful on larger disks: The simplistic design starts wasting large amounts of space (in an absolute sense) for extremely large volumes * Poor scalability: While the size remains negligible as a percentage of the disk size, finding free space becomes slower as the disk fills. If the bitmap is larger than available memory, performance drops precipitously on all operations * Fragmentation: If free sectors are taken as they are found, drives with frequent file creation and deletion will rapidly become fragmented. If the search attempts to find contiguous blocks, finding free space becomes much slower for even moderately full disks. Advanced techniques As the drive size grows, the amount of time needed to scan for free space can become unreasonable. To address this, real world implementations of free space bitmaps will find ways to centralize information on free space. One approach is to split the bitmap into many chunks. A separate array then stores the number of free sectors in each chunk, so chunks with insufficient space can be easily skipped over, and the total amount of free space is easier to compute. Finding free space now entails searching the summary array first, then searching the associated bitmap chunk for the exact sectors available. This approach drastically reduces the cost of finding free space, but it doesn't help with the process of freeing space. If the combined size of the summary array and bitmap is greater than can readily be stored in memory and a large number of files with scattered sectors are freed, an enormous amount of disk access is necessary to find all the sectors, decrement the summary counter and flip the bits back to zero. This greatly reduces the benefits of the bitmap, as it is no longer performing its function of summarizing the free space rapidly without reading from the disk.

It is the parish school for the St. Patrick Catholic Church. History In 1926, Monsignor William Barry and five Dominican sisters from Adrian, Michigan changed five polo stables that Carl G. Fisher had donated to the parish into five classrooms and a cafeteria. Due to the damage caused by the September 17, 1926 hurricane to the school buildings, the school did not open until two weeks after the hurricane had passed. Also, only 20 of the 150 students registered prior to the hurricane attended on opening day. In 1927, two more classrooms were added. There was only one high school graduate in the class of 1927, 1928, and 1929, and only three graduates in 1930. A $75,000 building permit was issued on May 31, 1930, for St. Patrick Catholic Elementary and High School. The first of three units opened in September of the two-story school building, which was completed in 1932. Accreditation in the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools became a reality in 1933, along with the acceptance by the State of Florida. The last 12th grade graduation was in 1972 and there were 37 graduates. The school continues to provide education from Kindergarten to 8th grade.

R. Grace and Company shipping company of New York City and of Grace Brothers & Co. Ltd. of London, England. Born in Queenstown, County Cork, Ireland. to a wealthy family, as a young man he went to Peru where his father had business interests and where he joined his brother William who had formed a partnership with John Bryce to operate as ship chandlers. William Grace would emigrate to the United States in 1865 where he established W. R. Grace & Co. of New York, while Michael Grace remained in Peru developing government contacts for the business that became Grace Brothers & Co. Michael Grace expanded the business into new fields including a near monopoly in the business of supplying the construction contractors building Peru's railway system with rail track iron and timber for rail ties plus foodstuffs and other provisions. The Grace brothers' influence with the Peruvian government saw them obtain the most of the contracts to provide munitions and battle ships during the Peru-Chile War of the Pacific between 1877 and 1884. When the war ended, Michael Grace traveled to England and in 1887 put together a consortium of lenders to provide the funding necessary to stabilize the cash-strapped government of Peru.The New York Times The Oroya Railroad and the richest silver mine in the world Michael Grace too emigrated to the United States where he would become an American citizen. The Grace brothers, along with Michael Grace's English son-in-law, Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 6th Earl of Donoughmore, widened their business in Peru to include control of the guano deposits along the Pacific coast, vast tracts of land containing both oil and mineral deposits including silver mines at Cerro de Pasco that were reported by The New York Times in its June 22, 1885 edition as \\"probably the richest and most extensive in the world.\\" In conjunction with the Cerro de Pasco mines, the Grace's acquired a ninety-nine year lease, the first seven of which were free, on the financially troubled Oroya Railroad originally built in early 1870s by American promoter Henry Meiggs but not fully completed. In that same June 22, 1885 story, The New York Times concluded that \\"Mr. Grace [Michael P.] gets a property which cost $27,600,900—86 miles of railroad already equipped and in operation, 50 miles of the most expensive tunneling and grading in the world—for nothing provided he will complete the line.\\"The New York Times The New-York and Pacific Steamship Company From a base in Lima, the Grace brothers set up representative offices throughout most of South America and through their Compania Salitrera obtained control over all nitrate exported by the government of Chile. Their business in Chile was such that they eventually established Grace & Co. in Valparaíso.The New York Times To support the vast Grace South American operations with lower costs and in-house control, in 1892 the Grace brothers established The New-York and Pacific Steamship Company, Limited, progenitor of their Grace Steamship Company. The operation began with a fleet of six newly built steam-powered freighters that shipped products manufactured in the United States from the port at New York City around Cape Horn to various ports on the west coast of South America. The ships returned with cargos of raw materials, primarily from the Grace brothers South American businesses. The shipping company was incorporated and headquartered in London, England, with Michael Grace as chairman of the board. He began spending a part of each year in England where between 1894 and 1915 he leased Battle Abbey as a residence for his family.Battle Abbey He spent the other part of the year in the United States, where he maintained a home at Westbury on Long Island near daughter Margarita and her husband, John Shaffer Phipps, of the prominent Phipps family. In 1916, Michael Grace oversaw Grace Steamship Company's addition of a mail delivery service between New York and its regular South American ports. Consolidation of holdings Michael and William Grace had a third brother, John W. Grace. For years he remained mostly out of the limelight running a business in San Francisco, California. However, with Michael based in London, England for half the year plus his extensive travelling to South America, when William developed health problems in the early 1890s it made it necessary for John to come to New York to help oversee operations. As part of estate and successor planning, in 1895 the three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company incorporated in West Virginia called W. R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W. R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaíso, Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco. The officers of the new company were:The New York Times * President – William R. Grace * 1st Vice-President – Michael P. Grace * 2nd Vice-President – John W. Grace * Secretary & Director – Edward Eyre * Director – Lillius Grace (Mrs. W. R.) * Treasurer – J. Louis Schaefer J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, would play a key role in not only W. R. Grace & Company in which he became a vice-president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer would be a co-executor of the Estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927.The New York Times William Grace died in March 1904 in New York and brother John in September of that same year in London, England. Michael Grace then assumed control of all their companies. Because he had four daughters but no sons, Michael took William's most capable son, Joseph, under his wing and would eventually transfer his interest in the Grace businesses to him. Family Michael Grace married Margarita Mason (1848-1930) The couple had four daughters: Elisa, Elaina, Margarita, and Gladys. Tragedy struck the family on August 10, 1917 when daughter Elisa drowned while swimming in a lake in Italy. Elisa married the Hon. Hubert Beaumont, a former Member of the British Parliament for Eastbourne. Elisa and Michael Beaumont had one child, Michael Beaumont. She was working as a volunteer for the Red Cross during World War I at the time of her death.The New York Times Margarita married American businessman John Shaffer Phipps in 1903. While on an annual business trip to London, England in the late summer of 1920, the then seventy-eight-year-old Michael Grace died.

On 18 October 1919, she was in harbour at Blyth, Northumberland () for repairs to her main engines and moored a few yards from the Royal Navy submarine when, during the afternoon, she built up a head of steam and began to carry out a slow-speed trial. In the restricted waters of the dock basin the suction from Vulcan′s propellers drew H41 towards her and, despite the efforts of both crews to keep the two vessels apart, Vulcan′s screws struck the stern of the submarine, cut through her outer casing, and sliced open her pressure hull.

It is a Grade II listed building. History In the late 19th century the local board of health had held its meetings at the Hendon Union Workhouse in the Burroughs. After the formation of Hendon Urban District in 1896, civic leaders decided this arrangement was inadequate for their needs and decided to procure purpose-built municipal buildings: the site selected for the new facility in the Burroughs had previously been part of the Grove House estate. The foundation stone for the new municipal buildings was laid the chairman of the council, John Evans, in 1900. The new building, which was designed by Thomas Henry Watson in the Pre-Renaissance style and was built by Kingerlee and Sons, was officially opened by the then chairman of the council, F.W. Roper, on 13 November 1901. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto the Burroughs; the central section featured a porte-cochère flanked by Doric order columns on the ground floor; there were three mullion windows flanked by oriel windows on the first floor; on the roof a timber lantern with a weather vane was erected. The principal room was the council chamber on the first floor. After the area was given municipal borough status as the Municipal Borough of Hendon, the building became known as \\"Hendon Town Hall\\" in 1932. It continued to be the local seat of government after the borough was merged with the Municipal Borough of Finchley and several urban districts to form the London Borough of Barnet in 1965. Margaret Thatcher made her first speech as Prime Minister at the town hall in May 1979 and she returned to unveil a statue entitled the Family of Man by Itzhak Ofer in 1981. Finchley had never had its own town hall and Hendon Town Hall was sometimes, incorrectly, referred to by members of the press as \\"Finchley Town Hall\\" in the 1980s. Barnet Trades Union Council, which had been dissolved during the deindustrialisation of the early 1990s, was reformed at the town hall in 2008. The Barnet register office, which had been based at Burnt Oak in Edgware, moved to the town hall in February 2017. Many of the other council officers and their departments, who had previously been located at disparate locations around the council area, moved to Barnet House in Colindale, just over a mile to the west of the town hall, in 2018. However, meetings of the full council have continued to be held at Hendon Town Hall.

The organization works to elect progressive Democrats to the Senate and House of Representatives, and advocates for progressive policies for national and local political issues. It also operates a sister organization, called the Progressive Change Institute, which it describes as a \\"people-powered think tank\\". The PCCC was co-founded in 2009 by Adam Green and Stephanie Taylor. Aaron Swartz, Michael Snook and Forrest Brown were some of the organization's original employees. Spokespersons for the group have included Laura Friedenbach, Marissa Barrow, Giovanni Hashimoto and Neil Sroka. The PCCC claims to have nearly one million members and former MSNBC host Ed Schultz has described it as the \\"top progressive group in the country.\\" The organization is closely allied with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. In 2011, the PCCC launched and led the draft campaign urging Warren to run and, following her campaign launch, raised over $1.17 million and made over 500,000 GOTV calls on her behalf. The draft campaign was described as the year's most valuable by The Nation. During the lead-up to the 2016 elections, the PCCC did not join other progressive groups in urging Warren to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president. Citing Warren's decision not to run, the PCCC instead urged candidates to adopt Warren's focus on economic populism, with a spokesperson saying it is \\"facilitating a race to the top on big Elizabeth Warren-style ideas\\". It has stayed officially neutral in the Democratic primary but an aide to Clinton did meet with the head of the PCCC and the PCCC has applauded her campaign's policy proposals. The PCCC raises millions of dollars annually for its campaigns. As a freestanding political action committee, it can only accept individual donations of $5,000 or less per election cycle. Much of the organization's spending goes into salaries for employees working on issue advocacy campaigns as well as supporting candidates. The PCCC is a major subject of The MoveOn Effect, a book published by the Oxford University Press authored by David Karpf. Elizabeth Warren The PCCC is closely allied with Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. In July 2011, the PCCC launched the grassroots effort to draft Warren to run for Senate in Massachusetts. Over 60,000 members joined the draft as potential volunteers or donors. The group organized several Draft Elizabeth Warren house parties across Massachusetts. Supporters met to discuss the best way to support her candidacy and campaign were she to announce that she was going to run. In September 2011, after the demonstration of grassroots support, Warren announced she would run in 2012 against Republican Scott Brown. The organization raised over $100,000 for her potential candidacy prior to her announcement which it transferred to her campaign upon its launch. The campaign to draft Warren was declared “The Most Valuable Campaign of 2011” by The Nation. With almost 50,000 individual contributions, the PCCC raised over $1.17 million and made over 500,000 GOTV calls on her behalf. In her book, A Fighting Chance, Senator Warren writes that the \\"Progressive Change Campaign Committee signed on early with the petition encouraging me to run, and they stayed with me every day right through the election.\\" Since her election, the PCCC has continued to work closely with Senator Warren through both her official and political offices. This has included joint endorsements of candidates and coordination on fundraising for supported candidates. The organization even coined the term, \\"Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party\\". During the lead-up to the 2016 elections, many progressive groups began campaigns urging Warren to challenge Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for president, but the PCCC was notably absent. Citing Warren's statements that she would not run, the PCCC instead urged Clinton and the other candidates to adopt Warren's focus on economic populism, with a spokesperson saying it is \\"facilitating a race to the top on big Elizabeth Warren-style ideas\\". It has stayed officially neutral in the Democratic primary but an aide to Clinton did meet with the head of the PCCC and the PCCC has applauded her campaign's policy proposals. Electoral campaigns In addition to Elizabeth Warren, the organization lists Senators Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Al Franken (D-MN), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) as candidates it supports. In the House of Representatives, they list Mike Honda (CA-17), Mark Takano (CA-41), Ruben Gallego (AR-07), Bonnie Watson Coleman (NJ-12), Alan Grayson (FL-09), Keith Ellison (MN-05), Rick Nolan (MN-08), Donna Edwards (MD-04), Raul Grijalva (AZ-03), Mark Pocan (WI-02), and Hakeem Jeffries (NY-08) among their candidates. Bill Halter In 2010, Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter challenged the moderate Democratic incumbent United States Senator Blanche Lincoln in the primary. The PCCC helped Halter run a grassroots campaign that included a statewide field program. The group debuted their Call Out The Vote program and its members made tens of thousands of volunteer calls, as well as raising more than $250,000. Halter lost the race to Lincoln, who lost to John Boozman, her Republican challenger in the general election. Wisconsin recall elections The PCCC was involved in the Wisconsin recall election. In February 2011, over 180,000 PCCC supported the Wisconsin recall movement by raising over $2 million with Democracy for America to run television ads (,) supporting the recall of Republican State Senators who had supported Republican Governor Scott Walker's Budget Repair Bill to limit collective bargaining rights for most Wisconsin state employees, excluding law enforcement agents. The ads won Pollies from the AAPC in 2012. They also used their Call Out The Vote program to make 382,623 calls in Wisconsin. The second part of the campaign began in early 2012, with the formal recall procedures against Scott Walker underway. The PCCC supported Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett as the Democratic challenger to Walker. In June 2012, Walker won the recall by a larger margin than he had originally defeated Barrett in 2010. P Street Project and Progressive Change Institute In July 2010, the progressive organization founded their own Congressional lobbying arm, P Street Project, to advance progressive policies from within Capitol Hill. The P Street Project victories include working with Representative Carolyn Maloney to organize a letter to President Obama asking him to nominate Elizabeth Warren for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Representative Jared Polis said that the P Street Project could generate a tremendous amount of energy from the public and progressive members of Congress as well as provide resources and political cover for liberal lawmakers. Other P Street successes include working with Rep. Marcy Kaptur to deliver over 140,000 petitions to the DOJ demanding a criminal investigation into Goldman Sachs for their involvement in the financial crisis. The PCCC, through P Street, worked with Congressional Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Raul Grijalva to defend Social Security and Medicare during the Debt Ceiling Crisis in 2011. The PCCC also operates the Progressive Change Institute, which it describes as a \\"people-powered think tank\\". Advocacy campaigns=\\"Donate a Dollar a Day to Make Norm Go Away\\" Following the 2008 Minnesota Senate election, between Al Franken and Norm Coleman, the PCCC and DFA organized a campaign in which their members contributed one dollar each day that Coleman refused to concede defeat. Ultimately, Franken was the confirmed victor after a statewide recount. The organizations raised nearly $150,000 for progressive candidates. Public option In 2009, the PCCC began a campaign for a public option in the Affordable Care Act. Though initial support in Congress for a public option seemed weak, the organization gathered over 65,000 signatures from Obama’s 2008 supporters in favor of a public option. The PCCC raised over $100,000 in 72 hours for a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for a public option that included 400 Obama staffers as signatories, as well as 25,000 volunteers from Obama's 2008 campaign and 40,000 of his donors. The Nation commended the group's efforts in reviving debate for the public option and their ability to organize within Congress to demonstrate the support that existed for it in Congress. The support included 120 Representatives and 24 Democratic Senators who signed letters asking Harry Reid to include a public option in the reconciliation bill. The PCCC made it clear to that there was strong public support for a public option, and they were going to hold Democrats in Congress accountable if they turned a blind eye to the demands of their constituents and the American people. The group followed through when they ran an ad holding Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) accountable; Baucus later announced he would not be running for re-election. Baucus left the Senate on February 6, 2014, before his term expired and was succeeded by John E. Walsh. In June 2012, when the Supreme Court handed down its ruling on the Affordable Care Act, the PCCC team and members were prepared outside the court. They demonstrated in large numbers and their posters calling for “Medicare for All” were prominent. Net neutrality and SOPA PCCC members continue to support major campaigns for Net Neutrality, advocating against censorship and supporting an open and accessible Internet. In 2010, the group launched GoogleDontBeEvil.com and helped deliver over 300,000 signatures to Google’s corporate headquarters, calling on them to honor their company motto, ”Don’t be evil” as well as end their secret deal with Verizon to kill Net Neutrality. Over 100,000 of the organization's members signed a petition telling U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski to deliver on real Net Neutrality protections – instead of letting corporations write the rules. And, 95 Congressional candidates in the 2010 elections promised to protect Net Neutrality due to the PCCC's work. All lost in the 2010 mid-term elections. The PCCC organized a massive campaign against the Stop Online Privacy Act bill the Senate was prepared to vote on. Working with Reddit, the group collected over 230,000 signatures petitioning Congress to protect internet innovation and vote against the bill. Safety net In January 2011, the PCCC delivered over 50,000 thank you notes written by its members to Senator Harry Reid after he took a stand against alleged proposals to cut Social Security benefits. PCCC challenged what they claimed were cuts to Social Security and Medicare. 200,000 PCCC members pledged not to volunteer or donate to Obama's re-election campaign if he cut benefits. Banxodus In November 2011, the PCCC started Banxodus, a website designed to help people move their money out of large banking institutions and into smaller, local credit unions and banks. The site uses crowdsourcing to provide more detailed information about both credit unions and community banks. Banxodus has more than 7,500 institutions in its database, which was created with the help of a few thousand volunteer researchers, and has grown as users add more information. Dump ALEC In April 2012, the PCCC initiated a campaign calling on major corporations to drop their support for the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which was blamed following the shooting of Trayvon Martin for reportedly having pushed the passage of “Stand Your Ground” laws in Florida as well as similar laws in 24 other states across the country. The PCCC called on its members for their help to get major corporations to stop funding ALEC, and within days the PCCC had over 23,000 signatures, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation issued a statement indicating they would stop supporting ALEC, and McDonald's became the sixth corporation to drop their support of ALEC. Within weeks, Procter and Gamble also stopped their funding of ALEC, the PCCC organized to have its members call their state legislators demanding that they quit their membership to ALEC, and PCCC members called AT&T;, State Farm, and Johnson & Johnson headquarters telling them to drop their support. By July 2012, other corporations to stop funding ALEC include Amazon, Best Buy, Coca-Cola, CVS, Dell Computers, Hewlett-Packard, Kraft foods, MillerCoors, and Wal-Mart. 55 legislators have also cut their ties as well. ALEC later reported it was disbanding its task-forces that were charged with passing voter ID laws and Stand Your Ground laws. Michigan House representatives Michigan House Republicans prevented state representative Lisa Brown (D-Royal Oak) from speaking on the floor in a debate about abortion legislation after Brown said: \\"I'm flattered that you're all so interested in my vagina, but no means no.\\" Brown was gaveled off the floor. The Speaker (at the time) of the Michigan House of Representatives, Jase Bolger, stated that by referencing \\"vagina\\", and then saying \\"no means no\\", Brown was making a reference to rape which was inappropriate for legislative setting. The PCCC promptly organized a campaign demanding Bolger and Stamas apologize to Brown and Barbara Byrum, who was also not allowed to speak that day. They garnered 115,000 signatures which Byrum delivered to Bolger. No apology was ever made.

Whence the Mountains?: Inquiries Into the Evolution of Orogenic Systems: A Volume in Honor of Raymond A. Price. Boulder, Colo.: Geological Society of America, 2007. The extrusive rock is composed of breccia and conglomerate. The intrusive rock has formed numerous dikes, sills, and plugs. An \\"enormous number of dikes...emanate radially from its center\\", Sheriff and Gunderson, \\"Age of the Adel Mountain Volcanic Field, West-Central Montana,\\" Isochron/West: A Bulletin of Isotopic Geochronology, December 1990, p. 21. many of which are visually striking and vertical, and can be seen from the interstate highway and other roads in the area. Many of the dikes clearly fed laccoliths in the area. Two concentric rings of laccoliths lie in the northwest section of the field and from the center of the area. Square Butte, Shaw Butte (near the town of Ft. Shaw), and Cascade Butte (next to the town of Cascade) are three laccoliths belonging to the Adel field which are famous local landmarks. More than of rock which used to exist on top of Square Butte has subsequently eroded to reveal the igneous rock which forms the laccolith. Each laccolith was fed by a radial dike at its distal end where it rolled over from vertical to form the horizontal laccolith. Laccoliths spread from the end of their feeder dike towards the more-elongate axis of the parent volcano, in response to load-imposed stresses of the volcano. Adel Mountain is the highest peak in the volcanic field, at above sea level, and an unnamed peak in the field is the second-highest at above sea level.Daumiller, Gerry. \\"Montana's Tallest Peaks by Mountain Range.\\" Natural Resource Information System. Montana State Library. Revised September 2007. Accessed 2009-09-30. Formation The age of the Adel Mountain Volcanic Field has been re- estimated several times since 1944. Based on fossil evidence, Lyons estimated in 1944 that the formation was late Cretaceous in origin, making it about 66 million years old. This estimate was reinforced in the early 1970s.Schmidt, Robert George. Geologic map of the Coburn Mountain quadrangle, Lewis and Clark and Cascade Counties, Montana. Quadrangle Map GQ-975. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Geological Survey, 1972. /> But separate analyses made in 1991 and 2004 re- estimated the rock as having formed in the late Cretaceous, about 81 to 71 million years ago. Most estimates today place the age at 75 million years. The Adel volcanics are part of the Laramide orogeny,Burchfiel, B. Clark. \\"Tectonics of Noncollisional Regimes.\\" In Continental Tectonics.

June 1992. Magma welled up from below for several million years, creating the Adel volcanics as well as the nearby Highwood Mountains and Judith Mountains. The crustal weakness associated with the Great Falls Tectonic Zone may have provided a route for the magma to reach the surface. Magma which never made it to the surface nonetheless created the many dikes, sills, plugs, and laccoliths which can be seen in the Adel volcanic field.Topinka, Lyn. \\"America's Volcanic Past - Montana.\\" Cascades Volcano Observatory, U.S. Geological Survey, June 11, 2003.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed up the Missouri River through the area in July 1805, becoming the first white Americans to see the formations. Development of the area did not come until the 1930s. Cattle ranchers were the area's first white settlers. The primary route over the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, the Mullan Road, skirted the volcanic field to the north, although dirt stagecoach roads were built into the Missouri River Canyon in the volcanic field in the 1860s.Axline, Jon. Conveniences Sorely Needed: Montana's Historic Highway Bridges, 1860-1956. Helena, Mont.: Montana Historical Society, 2005. The road was upgraded and turned into a toll road in 1866, and had become a major route from Helena through Great Falls to Fort Benton by the 1870s. The Montana Central Railway reached the region in 1887, which led to additional white settlement. A paved county road was laid down, and remained the sole access through the area for decades.Axline, Jon and Bradshaw, Glenda Clay. Montana's Historical Highway Markers. Rev. ed. Helena, Mont.: Montana Historical Society, 2008. In the 1920s, the Montana Highway Department began planning a major highway through the area as part of their effort to build U.S. Highway 91 and provide a direct road connection between Helena and Great Falls. Contracts were let in 1929, the majority of construction occurred from 1931 to 1934, and the highway was completed in 1935.

Stafford House (now Lancaster House, London) central hall and principal staircase, 1850. Joseph Nash (17 December 180919 December 1878) was an English watercolour painter and lithographer, specialising in historical buildings. His major work was the 4-volume Mansions of England in the Olden Time, published from 1839–49. Biography Nash was born in Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire, the oldest son of the Reverend Okey Nash who owned Manor House School in Croydon which Joseph went on to attend. He later studied with the artist and architect Augustus Charles Pugin, with whom he travelled to France to assist and prepare architectural drawings for a book entitled Paris and its Environs, published in 1830. In the early stage of his career Nash was engaged on figure subjects illustrating the poets and novelists, and exhibited many drawings with the Society of Painters in Water Colours, of which he was elected an associate in 1834, and a full member in 1842. Of these pictures, some were engraved for The Keepsake and similar publications, but he later became well known for his picturesque views of late Gothic buildings, which he peopled with figures grouped to illustrate the everyday life of their owners in times gone by—somewhat in the manner of George Cattermole. Despite being involved in a number of disputes with the Society, he continued to exhibit his artwork there until 1875. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy, British Institution and the New Society of Painters in Water Colours.Biography of James Nash (Hargrave Fine Art). Having mastered the art of lithography, Nash utilised it in the production of several excellent publications: Architecture of the Middle Ages appeared in 1838, and his four-volume masterpiece, Mansions of England in the Olden Time over a 10-year period from 1839, which involved Nash's travelling all over the country drawing house interiors and exteriors.The mansions of England in the olden time (New York: B. Hessling Co., 1912). He concentrated on the architectural aspects of the buildings, which, using the example of Joseph Strutt, he brought to life with the inclusion of groups of people. The volumes were very popular, with the lithographs circulated widely by newspapers, architects and other artists. The book was so effective it was claimed in Parliament that it was causing an increasing number of people to visit historical buildings. In 1846 he lithographed David Wilkie's Oriental Sketches and in 1848 a set of views of Windsor Castle from his own drawings. Other works to which Nash contributed were Lawson's Scotland Delineated (1847–54), Comprehensive Pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851,Dickinsons' comprehensive pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851: from the originals painted for H.R.H. Prince Albert (Dickinson, Brothers, 1854). McDermot's The Merrie Days of England (1858–59),Edward McDermott. The merrie days of England: sketches of the olden time (London: William Kent & Co., 1859). and English Ballads (1864). In 1854 he was described as suffering from \\"brain fever\\" and sold his studio later that year—the quality of his work declined dramatically from then on. He died at Hereford Road, Bayswater, London on 19 December 1878, having just a few months before been awarded a civil list pension of £100. His only son, Joseph Nash Jnr., was a marine painter and also a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-Colours.

These include artistic traditions in pottery, music, architecture, woodcarving and other genres. Somali art is characterized by its aniconism, partly as a result of the vestigial influence of the pre-Islamic mythology of the Somalis coupled with their ubiquitous Muslim beliefs. However, there have been cases in the past of artistic depictions representing living creatures such as the golden birds on the Mogadishan canopies, the ancient rock paintings in northern Somalia, and the plant decorations on religious tombs in southern Somalia, but these are considered rare. Instead, intricate patterns and geometric designs, bold colors and monumental architecture was the norm. History Ancient rock art depicting a camel. The oldest evidence of art in the Somali peninsula are pre-historic rock paintings. The rock art of Laas Geel are thought to be some of the best preserved in Africa, representing cows in ceremonial robes accompanied by humans. The necks of the cows are embellished with a kind of plastron, some of the cows are depicted as wearing decorative robes. The paintings not only show cows, but also a domesticated dogs, several paintings of canidae and a giraffe.The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3 Aspects of ancient Somali styles of architecture and art can be seen in the various Somali civilizations that flourished under Islam, particularly during the Mogadishan Golden Age and the Empire of Ajuran period (especially in the domain of architecture). In the early modern and contemporary era, poetry and theatrical ventures shaped much of today's Somali artistic culture. Carving Carving, known in Somali as qoris, is a much respected profession in Somalia both in historic and modern times. Many wealthy urbanites in the medieval period regularly employed the finest wood and marble carvers in Somalia to work on their interiors and houses. The carvings on the mihrabs and pillars of ancient Somali mosques are some of the oldest on the continent. Artistic carving was considered the province of men similar to how the Somali textile industry was mainly a women's business. Amongst the nomads, carving, especially woodwork, was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as spoons, combs and bowls, but it also included more complex structures such as the portable nomadic house, the aqal. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture has taken a backseat to the introduction of workshops employing electrical machinery which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.Culture and customs of Somalia By Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi pg 97 Textile The textile culture of Somalia is an ancient one, and the Somali textile center in Mogadishu was, from at least the 13th century to the late 19th century, considered to be one of the main textile hubs in the Indian Ocean. It competed with those of the Indians and later the Americans in domestic and foreign markets such as Egypt and Syria.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi(2001) pg 100 Metalwork The goldsmiths and blacksmiths of the urban cities, though often shunned by the dominant nomadic culture for their occupation, fashioned the city-dwellers' traditional display of wealth and power through ornaments such as jewelry in the case of women, or the intricately designed Somali dagger (toraay) in the case of men. Architecture Almnara Tower in Mogadishu, Somalia. Somali architecture is a rich and diverse tradition of engineering and designing multiple different construction types such as stone cities, castles, citadels, fortresses, mosques, temples, aqueducts, lighthouses, towers and tombs during the ancient, medieval and early modern periods in Somalia, as well as the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with Occidental designs in contemporary times. In ancient Somalia, pyramidical structures known in Somali as taalo were a popular burial style, with hundreds of these drystone monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of dressed stone similar to the ones in Ancient Egypt,Man, God and Civilization pg 216 and there are examples of courtyards and large stone walls such as the Wargaade Wall enclosing settlements. The adoption of Islam in the early medieval era of Somalia's history brought Islamic architectural influences from Arabia and Persia, which stimulated a shift from drystone and other related materials in construction to coral stone, sundried bricks, and the widespread use of limestone in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs such as mosques were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.Diriye, p.102 Visual Art is not new to the Somali communities. Visual art namely paintings focus on rural landscapes, and colorful paintings of the cultural life. Some of the known visual artists display their skills through their presence on Somali web sites. Visual Art is emerging as a new chapter in the history of Somali culture. When we talk about art, our attention is immediately drawn into performing art. Indeed, for some people, visual art is interpreted as anti religion, since it involves a corporal creation of a human being. There are very few Somali Visual Artists. They are under represented in the world of Modern African Art. Some of the known Somali Visual artists had created their own web sites such as www.osmanart.net/ This webpage is run by a Somali Physician Artist and writer - Mohamed Buwe Osman. There are many Somali visual artists like the well known to most of the Somals Mr. Amin Amir and Abdul Arts.

They also affected other parts of northeastern Sicily and killed a total of at least 31 people, some of whom were swept out to sea. More than 400 people were left homeless, as many houses collapsed. The places which suffered the most damage were Giampilieri Superiore, a small 10 kilometres south of the city of Messina, which was buried in mud; the of Scaletta Zanclea; and the of Briga Superiore. To avoid casualties, when the Messina region received heavy rains in February 2010, the government evacuated one-third of the population most at risk. A mudslide caused property damage, but no casualties.  Storm and mudslide  right On the night of 1–2 October 2009, a sudden downpour of rain, accompanied by strong winds and lightning, caused large mudslides through the valleys of the northeastern coast. The extreme nature of the weather gave people little time to flee buildings or vehicles; mud rapidly swept down from the surrounding hills and cliffs, clogging the streets of these towns with debris and grime, and carrying away people, cars, and dwellings. Officials reported that nine inches of rain fell in the space of three hours. In some areas, the mud was 20 meters deep. The slide hit so quickly that rescuers later found many people trapped in cars and dwellings. Rail lines were covered with mud and major roads into the area were blocked. One man was found dead in his automobile, which was submerged in mud and water. Another drowned in the flooded cellar of his country home. A man choked to death after taking in mud in when the main piazza was flooded in a suburb of the city of Messina. A survivor recounted his escape: \\"I was driving home when suddenly all this stuff came down on top of me and hit me full on. I managed to climb out of the car. It was a terrible experience\\". Cars were swept along by the mud. Many buildings collapsed; some were partially submerged by mud, and engulfed by water and debris. Some people were washed away into the Ionian Sea. At least 100 people evacuated their houses following mudslides. As of 8 October, seven people were still missing, and at least 450 inhabitants of the were left homeless by the extreme weather. 40 wounded people were hospitalised; at least two of these were said to have serious injuries. Messina has been surrounded by mud and standing rainwater. Parts of Sicily were inaccessible for days. The Italian government declared a state of emergency to mobilize emergency rescue and recovery forces. It was the worst landslide disaster in Italy since 1998 during which 137 people died in Sarno, near Naples. The death toll was expected to rise. The Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said that it could be as high as fifty.  Aid  Many survivors fled to rooftops, where a helicopter lifted them to safety. The first batch of evacuees escaped aboard boats; they were taken to the mainland or safe areas by rescue helicopters. Emergency crews dug through mud and used search dogs in an effort to find survivors. The mud covered roads and disrupted assistance efforts, as many rescue crews had to enter areas on foot. Medical teams were rushed to the scene. Bulldozers were also deployed. One rescue worker described it as \\"hell\\". Many survivors sought refuge in a convent. The railway line connecting Messina to the resort town of Taormina was blocked by debris and mud. Damage extended to the capital Palermo, where a hospital was partially flooded, and people were found trapped in their vehicles. Giampilieri Superiore, a small 10 kilometres south of the city of Messina, was totally buried in mud; the of Scaletta Zanclea; and the of Briga Superiore also suffered extensive, irreparable damage.  Reactions  An investigation into the \\"culpable disaster\\" was quickly underway. The origins of this environmental disaster are believed to result from a lack of forestation in the hills and lower valleys, caused by annual summer brushfires. In addition, according to Guido Bertolaso, director of the Italian Civil Protection Service, illegal construction without permits and in defiance of zoning regulations is widespread in Sicily; many lost homes were built illegally too close to or blocking known torrent beds, creating drainage problems.Jessica Donati, \\"Mudslides Kill at Least 18 in Eastern Sicily\\", New York Times, 2 October 2009, accessed 22 November 2012 Residents accused the local administration for having failed to secure the nearby hills from the risk of landslides, following mudslides that occurred in October 2007. These had caused property damage but no casualties. President Giorgio Napolitano said: \\"We need a serious investment plan to increase safety -- rather than grandiose public works -- in this part of the country, or else tragedies like this one will happen again\\".  Aftermath  As of 4 October, many bodies still have not been recovered from the mud and debris. Some of the victims were small children. Silvio Berlusconi visited the afflicted areas on 4 October and met with some of the people left homeless by the disaster. The scenes have been described by a Rai Uno news reporter as \\"apocalyptic\\". As of 6 October, Director of the Civil Defence Guido Bertolaso amended the number of missing people from 37 to nine. Officials thought some bodies of victims might never be recovered. On Saturday morning, 10 October 2009, a state funeral was held for the victims at the Cathedral of Messina. It was televised so that the nation could bear witness. When heavy rains struck the region of Messina in February 2010, the government evacuated one-third of the population most at risk by February 14. A large mudslide destroyed some houses, but caused no casualties.

In 1830 he was elected by the Legislative Assembly as President of the Superior Court of Justice of Costa Rica, but he declined the position. During 1833, while he was working as Federal Senator in Guatemala, the liberal groups from San José and Alajuela backed up his candidacy as chief of state of Costa Rica. Although he had the highest vote count, he was not able to achieve absolute majority and the Legislative Assembly chose José Rafael de Gallegos y Alvarado. Manuel Aguilar Chacón returned to Costa Rica on November 21, 1833. And in 1835 he was elected again as Representative for San José to cover the period 1835–1837. He presided the house of Representatives in 1835. In March of that same year, when the elected Chief of State to conclude the period in Gallegos, Nicolás Ulloa Soto, declined the position, the Assembly voted in favor of Aguilar Chacón to assume top command but he refused to admit the electoral process.  Head of the State  With the support of the communities of Alajuela, Cartago and Heredia, Manuel Aguilar Chacón defeated Braulio Carrillo Colina in the 1837 elections and was chosen as Head of State for Costa Rica for the period 1837–1841. As Vice-chief Juan Mora Fernández was elected. Both took office on April 17, 1837 at the city of Heredia, the Capital City of Costa Rica at the time. During his mandate, the law of 1835 that established the Capital in the City of Murciélago was repealed. He took measures in favour of health and education. He also reorganized the Superior Court of Justice. He did face great opposition from the supporters of Braulio Carrillo Colina. He even took a serious beating. In March, 1838 he presented his resignation as Chief of State but the Legislative Assembly rejected it.  Fall and Exile  Manuel Aguilar Chacón was overthrown on May 27, 1838 by a military coup d'état that rose Braulio Carrillo Colina into power. Aguilar Chacón had to flee in exile.

Manuel Aguilar Chacón traveled to Sonsonate, but the union meeting was never inaugurated.  Death  He died in Sonsonate, El Salvador, on July 7, 1846, as a consequence of pneumonia.

Life He was one of the earliest scholars of Jesus College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1501 and M.A. in 1503, and was elected fellow of Pembroke Hall on 24 November 1505. In 1507 he was chosen to preach before the university, and in 1509 graduated B.D., and was selected to read the divinity lecture instituted by Lord Chief Justice William Hussey. On 9 April 1511 he was appointed the first Master of St. John's College, newly founded by Lady Margaret Beaufort. Shorton superintended the progress of the work of building the college, resigning his office before 1517. He was already dean of the chapel to Thomas Wolsey, and through Wolsey's influence he received preferment. On 1 November 1517 he obtained the prebend of Donnington in the diocese of York, which on 7 May 1523 he exchanged for that of Fridaythorpe in the same see. In October 1518 he was chosen master of Pembroke Hall, and in the same year was appointed rector of Sedgefield, County Durham. On 7 May 1522 he was appointed rector of Stackpole in Pembrokeshire, and on 14 April 1523 he received the prebend of Louth in Lincoln Cathedral. About this time he was of service to Wolsey in selecting scholars at Cambridge to be invited to join Wolsey's new Cardinal College at Oxford. He received the honorary degree of D.D. from Oxford in 1525. On 8 April 1527 he was installed canon of Windsor. He was also Queen Catherine of Aragon's almoner, and, as a staunch Catholic, adhered to the Queen when the divorce question arose. He was one of the few clergymen who supported her cause in convocation. In 1529 Catherine appointed him Master of the college of Stoke-by-Clare in Sussex. In 1534 he resigned the mastership of Pembroke Hall, increasingly a Protestant institution. He became archdeacon of Bath in 1535, and, dying on 17 October of the same year, was buried at Stoke-by-Clare. By his will he left money to four Cambridge colleges.

The name was chosen as part of a city-run contest and the final name was announced on the t.o.night free evening commuter paper. Formerly, it was tentatively known as CityPlace Park. The park's ribbon cutting ceremony was on September 9, 2009. The Park was designed by Landscape Architects Phillips Farevaag Smallenberg of Vancouver in collaboration with Landscape Architects, The Planning Partnership of Toronto, Public Art Consultant Karen Mills and Douglas Coupland. The park incorporates integrated artwork in the form of a landform (the bluff) and stand alone art pieces by Douglas Coupland: a canoe large enough for people to stand in and see over the Gardiner to Lake Ontario, a colourful display of large fishing bobbers, a sculptural beaver dam, programmed tree lighting (which will be more evident as the trees fill out), a pair of \\"iceberg benches\\" situated near the canoe, the \\"heart-shaped stone\\" bronze artwork which was cast from a stone retrieved by Terry's brother at the end of his journey and a one-mile run called the Terry Fox Miracle Mile. The developers of Concord CityPlace are Concord Adex Developments. On the advice of their consultant, Karen Mills, Concord approached Douglas Coupland, the Vancouver author, artist and sculptor. Some of Douglas Coupland's other recent Toronto projects include Super Nova, a sculptural work/clock tower in North York (at the Don Mills Centre) and \\"Monument to the War of 1812,\\" situated on Fleet and Bathurst street corner (just south of Old Fort York). The canoe promontory was created as part of a proposed \\"earthwork\\" identified in the public art masterplan for Concord CityPlace (Public Art Management, Karen Mills, 1999) and was made from on site excavated fill and geosynthetic reinforcements. The hill has an elevation that allows viewers to see over the Gardiner Expressway to Lake Ontario. Some 20,000-25,000 dumptruck loads of fill were diverted from landfills.

Early life and family  Alfaro was born in Alajuela, Costa Rica on March 20, 1799 to his parents Juan Antonio Alfaro y Arias and María Damiana Zamora y Flores. On May 19, 1825 he married María Josefa Sandoval y Jiménez. With her he fathered José Joaquín Alfaro Sandoval, a daughter who died early in her childhood, and Calixto Alfaro Sandoval. Alfaro was a farmer and a businessman. He owned lands devoted to coffee plantation and a sawmill in Itiquís near Alajuela. He also participated in a lumber company in Jinotepe, Nicaragua.  Public activities  He served as supply deputy for Alajuela (1825-1827), second mayor of Alajuela (1828), deputy for Alajuela (1829-1831), deputy for Heredia (1834-1836), political leader of the western department (1841) and magistrate of the Judicial Chamber (1841-1842). On September 27, 1842, in a junta convocated by then Head of State Antonio Pinto Soares, José María Alfaro Zamora was designated Provisional Head of State. During his administration he built the road that connects San José to Puntarenas, founded Universidad de Santo Tomás, emitted the 1844 Constitution, and founded the newspaper \\"Mentor Costarricense\\". He lost the 1844 elections to Francisco María Oreamuno Bonilla. On November 29, 1844 he gave Oreamuno his office which was meant to last until 1848. On June 7, 1846 after a coup d'état Alfaro was again declared Provisional Head of State. During this administration Puntarenas was declared a free port, the 1847 Constitution was emitted and a failed diplomatic mission with Nicaragua was launched in a second attempt to sign a border agreement with this country (a previous attempt by Braulio Carrillo in 1838 had also failed). Although he lost the 1847 elections to José María Castro Madriz he won the office of Vice President for the next term. In order to comply with the new Constitution, from May 1 to May 8, 1847 he used the title President of the State. On May 8, 1847 he was succeeded by Castro. In May 1847, he became Vice President of the State, but he had to quit months after. Accused of corruption, he was confined to Térraba and later moved to Panama.  Aftermath and death  He later returned to Costa Rica but refused to participate in politics. He died in Alajuela on June 11, 1856 due to cholera.

History Conquerville (or Maleb) was first established in the early 20th century, the area previously having been used by ranchers along the McLeod Trail, en route to Fort McLeod. The route, which had been converted into a railway during the 1890s, brought many passengers and ranchers nearby Conquerville, including coal miners after coal was discovered in the area early in the 20th century. In 1909, Conquerville underwent an agricultural boom, which brought many farmers to the area. The First World War brought prosperity to Conquerville, with the 1915–16 harvest benefiting all; however, the post-war period saw the town fall on hard times. Disease ravaged the local cattle population, and Spanish influenza crippled many families. Grants to farmers, coupled with land grants to new residents supported by the government, led to a revival of the town. In 1945, a large Conquerville school opened, combining nine different school districts into one large centralized district. In 1954, the town was electrified, and in 1965 the town celebrated its 50th anniversary of its founding, publishing a book, Conquerville: a growing community, to celebrate. Decline Starting in the 1980s, Conquerville began its decline. During these years, the local high school – the heart of the community – was closed down due to a lack of enrollment and was partially destroyed by fire in 1992. Today all that remains of the community is a basketball court, baseball field, ruins of the high school, overgrown with weeds and now used for storage by a local farmer. The community hall still remains nearby, and is still used on the odd occasion. Only a few residents remain, it is believed that the farming community of the area began its fall when the school closed.

The Gouines Rouges were founded in April 1971, out of a wish to assert themselves within both the feminist movement and the homosexual movement, and the fear that lesbians were in danger of disappearing.  History  In April 1971, the Mouvement de libération des femmes (MLF, \\"Women's Liberation Movement\\") had existed for two and a half years. Three hundred women who were coming regularly to its general meetings at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts then launched a campaign for free abortion and birth control. The Front homosexuel d'action révolutionnaire (FHAR, \\"Homosexual Front for Revolutionary Action\\"), a radical movement rejecting reforms in favor of homosexuality that they deemed inadequate or timid, had been created a month earlier on the initiative of MLF activists and some members of the homophile organization Arcadie. The \\"alliance between the MLF girls and the FHAR gays\\" seemed so obvious that no one questioned the FHAR's gender-mixing.

The power that we claim is our self-realization.\\" But the appearance of Tout #12, in which gays and lesbians publicly spoke out in a far-left newspaper for the first time, tipped the balance between the sexes over to the male side. With men flocking to the FHAR, the lesbians felt marginalized, their number remaining substantially the same. Feminist activists felt dispossessed by the FHAR. Finally, the militant lesbians held a meeting against the FHAR's \\"misogyny\\" in the Beaux-Arts auditorium. Some fifty activists, aged between twenty and thirty-five, founded the Gouines rouges. The name was taken from the invective of a hostile passerby during a demonstration. The movement became known through leafleting at the entrances to women's clubs in the Quartier Pigalle and Chez Moune. In June 1971, a party at Les Halles was organized \\"to celebrate with joy the beginning of our rebellion, to come out of our ghettos, to finally live our love in broad daylight.\\"Bibliothèque Marguerite-Durand, dossier on the MLF Shortly afterward, the group split off from the FHAR to rejoin the MLF, meeting as an informal discussion group. Concepts such as \\"becoming lesbian by political choice\\" were introduced or discussed there. The Gouines rouges asserted themselves within the MLF with \\"happenings\\" in the general meetings, with themes like \\"Are lesbians women?\\" or \\"Our problem is yours too,\\" or during the \\"Days of denunciation of crimes against women,\\" held at the Maison de la Mutualité on May 14–15, 1972. Meetings of the Gouines rouges then became more infrequent, despite the encouragement of Monique Wittig. Membership The group included Monique Wittig, Christine Delphy, Marie-Jo Bonnet, Dominique Poggi, Catherine Deudon, Évelyne Rochedereux, and Josiane Gamblain.

It was founded in the 12th century in the most northerly of the three settlements in Lancing parish, which has Saxon origins. The present building is mostly 13th-century in appearance, and structural work has been carried out several times since—particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the church was restored from a ruinous condition. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance. History The name Lancing suggests Saxon influence (the -ing suffix implied, in Saxon terms, a temporary settlement), and remains dating from the 6th century have been found nearby. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, the Lord of the Manor of nearby Broadwater, Robert le Savage, held the manor of Lancing. The land in the parish, which extended from the South Downs to the English Channel coast, was chiefly agricultural. Around this time, the large manor was divided into several smaller ones, of which North Lancing and South Lancing (as they became known) were the most important. Gradually, three settlements developed: North Lancing, closest to the Downs; South Lancing, near the coast; and the nearby Pende (now vanished), on the coast and briefly a successful port. No church existed in the area at that time, but one was established in North Lancing in the 12th century: a date of around 1120 has been suggested from analysis of surviving masonry at the ends of the chancel. In about 1180, an arched doorway, now forming part of the porch on the south side, was added. The whole structure was rebuilt between about 1280 and 1300, giving the church its present layout. It presents a consistent and harmonious architectural impression, despite the long period of time needed to complete the work. A stair turret leading up to the tower was built in the 15th century; part of the north aisle had to be blocked to accommodate this. In the 17th century—especially after the Restoration of 1660—Anglican religious worship declined and many churches in England fell into disrepair. This attitude was common among the people of Sussex, where church attendances declined dramatically in many villages, including North Lancing. The first sign of structural decay at St James the Less Church came in 1618, when the upper part of the tower collapsed. By 1621 it had been repaired by cutting it down in size and topping it with a \\"Sussex cap\\"-style roof. The rest of the building quickly fell into ruins, however: birds were found to be nesting inside, pigeons bred there and the font was empty. By 1662, the church could no longer be used. The situation improved in the late 18th century, when some restoration work was carried out. More substantial rebuilding in 1827 added extra pews and altered several windows. The most recent addition was a vestry in 1934. Architecture The church is built of flint cobblestones. Areas of pebbledashing remain, although some was removed in the mid-20th century. Ashlar has been used as well. Architecturally, the timing and completeness of the late 13th-century rebuilding has resulted in the church presenting an unusually complete example of the transition from the Early English Gothic style to the Decorated Gothic style. The church has, from west to east, a three-bay nave with aisles on the north and south sides, a short tower and a chancel with a lower roofline than the nave. There is a porch with an entrance doorway on the south side, another door at the west end and a vestry at the northeast corner as well. Until its collapse in 1618, the tower was much taller and ended in a parapet. The reconstruction shortened it (making the upper windows smaller) and added a Sussex cap—a shallow pyramid- shaped slate roof common in Sussex. The date was commemorated by an inscription on the north wall. The church's original entrance doorway has been retained in the south porch: it has a round arch carried on chamfered shafts with Norman-style capitals. The detail on the stonework, although characteristic of the Norman period, is more intricate than usual. The arch has a hood mould, which sits clear of the abaci at the top of the shafts. Inside the doorway is an ancient stoup for holy water, which is now in poor condition. The other doorway, in the west face, is similar to its south-face counterpart, but is more likely to be 15th-century than 12th-century. Buttresses seem to have been added around the tower at some point during the 17th century, and a large buttress remains on the south side of the chancel. This was thought to be hollow until it was analysed properly in 1948 when pebbledashing was removed from the exterior. Most of the windows are either one- or two-light Decorated Gothic, although some later examples are in the Perpendicular Gothic style. Some of the chancel windows are larger, with three lights. Stained glass, by an unknown designer, was installed in three windows in 1866. Inside the church, remnants of the original Norman building can be seen at opposite ends: in the west wall of the nave and the east end of the chancel. The chancel, nave and aisles were rebuilt (to the same dimensions as the original building) when English Gothic architecture was at its height, and the chamfered arches, octagonal pillars, chancel arch, blind arches and mouldings are considered good examples of their kind. The king post roof of the nave has also been praised. Interior fittings include a 14th-century Easter sepulchre with an ogee-arched roof, part of a sedilia, some Norman friezework, and a 12th-century square font in good condition. Today St James the Less Church was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 12 October 1954. Such buildings are defined as being of \\"exceptional interest\\" and greater than national importance. As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and 119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district. The style of worship in the church is Traditional Catholic. Eucharistic services take place every Wednesday and Sunday: there are evening prayer services everyday, and Family Eucharist on the third Sunday each month. The parish, in its present form, covers . The eastern boundary is the River Adur; the railway line between the river and Leconfield Road forms the southern limit; on the west side, the ancient boundary with Sompting parish, now running up Boundstone Lane and Upper Boundstone Lane, is retained; and old field boundaries on the South Downs have been preserved in the north.

The Trust seeks to connect the coffee industry and coffee consumers to victims of conflict and provides resources for rehabilitation services and economic development opportunities. It is a project of the non-profit organization Polus Center for Social & Economic Development based in Clinton, Massachusetts, United States. Dean Cycon, owner of Deans Beans, a coffee-roasting company in Central Massachusetts and Michael Lundquist, Executive Director of the Polus Center for Social & Economic Development have worked for many years in developing countries to promote social and economic justice for some of the world's most vulnerable groups. Deans Beans and the Polus Center have partnered in the grassroots development projects that have created economic opportunity for \\"death train\\" victims in Tapachula, Mexico, assisted people with disabilities to create small businesses in Nicaragua, and worked together to address basic nutritional needs and helped to combat social stigma for people with leprosy in Ethiopia. In 2005, Cycon's knowledge and experience with coffee farmers and their struggles and Lundquist's work with landmine victims allowed them to make the connection between landmines, unexploded ordnance, or UXO, and coffee. After review of the data they determined that landmines and UXO were present in six of the ten top coffee-producing countries in the world, and that these deadly devices not only kill and maim coffee farmers and their families, but have a significant negative impact on coffee production and the quality of coffee. While the Ottawa Treaty focused the world's attention on the need to address the landmine issue; the majority of money and resources are directed toward mine removal and mine risk education; very little support is being allocated to direct victim assistance. The United States and other donor nations have made substantial progress in the areas of landmine removal and mine risk education, but resources for direct victim assistance have been minimal and will likely continue to be. Because of the lack of resources for rehabilitation services many landmine survivors are facing a very uncertain future.

The dead man was at all times paid by the company, and the company alone had the power to dismiss him. The question was whether Mr Denham's insurer or the insurer of the company should pay the damages to the deceased man's widow.

At 444, ‘These results are achieved in law by holding that Clegg became for the time being the temporary servant for Le Grands. There is no harm in thus describing him so long as it is remembered that it is a device designed to cast liability on the temporary employer. The real basis of the liability is, however, simply this: if a temporary employer has the right to control the manner in which a labourer does his work, so as to be able to tell him the right way or the wrong way to do it, then he should be responsible when he does it in the wrong way as well as in the right way.

Their reproduction in the April 30, 1965, edition of Life magazine sparked so much interest that the entire print run, of eight million copies, sold out within four days; they won Nilsson the American National Press Association Picture of the Year award, and reached a sufficiently iconic status to be chosen for launch into space aboard the NASA probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. The book and its images have figured in debates about abortion and the beginning of life, and the book is the subject of a substantial body of feminist critique. Synopsis The book proceeds along two \\"tracks\\": one series of photographs and accompanying text depict the development of the fetus from conception through to birth; the other shows a woman and her partner as her pregnancy progresses. Early images show sperm proceeding toward an ovum; cell division, implantation, and the development of the embryo are then illustrated. The text accompanying the photographs of the woman supplies some antenatal care advice. Reception Life, an American magazine, marked the publication of A Child Is Born by reproducing in its 30 April 1965 edition 16 of the book's photographs. The pictures were run simultaneously in the British Sunday Times and in Paris Match. All eight million printed copies of Life containing the images sold out within four days. The book became reportedly the all-time best-selling illustrated book published; its ubiquity led the academic Barbara Duden to deem it and its pictures \\"part of the mental universe of our time\\". Images, text, and diagrams from the book have been reproduced in works as diverse as guides to child protection, development science and anatomy textbooks, and pregnancy manuals. It is widely cited as a pregnancy resource in parenting manuals, and the academic Rebecca Kukla has argued that the book was so culturally influential as to have mediated and to some extent determined the way pregnant women understand their own pregnancies. Images from the book were sent into space aboard the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 space probes. The American Library Association regards it, alongside Gray's Anatomy, as a core medical reference work for libraries. The book was often cited as presenting the first images of a live fetus in utero. In fact, Geraldine Flanagan's The First Nine Months Of Life had in 1962 compiled a similar set of fetal images from medical archives. The images played an important role in debates about abortion and the beginning of human life. Nilsson himself declined to comment on the origins of some of the photographs' subjects, which in fact included many images of terminated and miscarried fetuses: all but one of the images that appeared in Life were of fetuses that had been surgically removed from the womb. Nilsson also refused to be drawn on the question of the point at which life begins, describing himself as a journalist and the debate as one for other authorities. Pro-life campaigners perceived and presented the book's images as evidence that a fetus is a well-developed, discrete human person from well before birth. Pro-choice activists, on the other hand, have portrayed the images (and the technology they represent) as evidence of medical and imaging techniques that now allow serious fetal defects to be detected very early and furnish pregnant parents with more information upon which to base choices. Some critics have described as ironic the image's popularity with pro-life campaigners who argue that the fetus is a living human, given that many of them depict (surgically or spontaneously) aborted fetuses. Both the popularity of the images with pro-life campaigners and the photographic techniques, which have been described as eliding the presence of the woman in whose womb the fetus is developing, have made the book the subject of substantial feminist critique. Some of these criticisms have addressed the book's language, which often describes the photographs' subjects as \\"persons\\" or \\"babies\\". Others argue that the focus on the fetus that the book promoted rendered the woman in whose body it was developing invisible and unimportant, or contributed to an atmosphere in which the woman and the fetus were seen as remote, opposite, and in competition with one another for rights and personhood. Others, though, have described Nilsson's book as placing the story of fetal development firmly within the context of the woman's body and life. Some scholars have sought to deconstruct the techniques used and choices made in the images' production, pointing out for example that lighting magnification is used to give month-old fetuses the appearance of a much more viable six-month-old, and lightening techniques used to replace the fetus's deep red skin tone with a \\"baby-like\\" pink or gold tone. Publishing history By the first decade of the 21st century the book had reached a fourth edition and been published in 20 countries. A CD version of the book was produced in 1994, rendering the images interactive. How Was I Born?, an adaptation of the book's text for children, featured many of the same images. * ReferencesExternal links * Images from A Child Is Born at Nilsson's official website * Photographic gallery of images from A Child Is Born, in the Daily Telegraph * The Lonesome Space Traveller: A Child Is Born feature at the Making Visible Embryos project, History and Philosophy of Science Department, University of Cambridge.

Plot summary A day has come when not one, but two UFOs make their way into Earth's atmosphere. The larger ship is clearly chasing the smaller one, and the alien has the look of a soldier about him. The smaller ship is able to cause the larger one to crash, then lands itself. The pilot (Renn) sets out for town looking for an Earth woman named Annie Nilssen. Annie is a local school teacher who has recently broken up with her boyfriend, Sheriff Jack Logan. While she's on a girl's night out at the tavern with a friend, she encounters Renn. Refusing his offer to take her home, they nonetheless share a smoking hot kiss. Feeling ill during school the next day she goes to her doctor only to be told she is 2 1/2 months pregnant - an impossibility not only because she broke up with Logan four months ago, but because uterine scarring had made her infertile. While reading up on pregnancy and baby books at home that night she is found by Renn. He explains that he is the father of her baby and insists she come with him to escape the following alien killer. Renn ends up having to kidnap Annie. When she wakes the next day he gives her an egg-shaped supplement and tries to explain to her about how his world had died and why his people needed Earth women - to repopulate themselves. The baby's pregnancy is meant to be done in three days and he has to take her back to his ship. Annie doesn't believe him and tries to escape until she meets Willard, the second alien. He had accompanied Jack Logan and his deputies on a rescue expedition and tries to kill Annie on the trail. His attempt is foiled by one of the deputies and Renn is able to reclaim Annie and keep moving her to his ship. When his ship is found to be destroyed by a lightning storm they must continue on to the nearest mountaintop to try and connect with his mother-ship. Over the course of their journey Annie begins to soften towards her captor. And Renn in turn discovers he's developing feelings for the Earth woman. They barely make it in time to a mountain where the baby's psychic cry has alerted the mother-ship to come for them. Annie has the baby. Renn kills Willard in a final fight but is mortally wounded. He tells Annie he repaired the damage to her uterus, she can have children of her own now. Renn dies at peace with having completed his mission, and his people take his body and the baby away. Annie and Jack embrace, and Annie looks up at the departing ship wondering what will become of the little girl known as \\"Daughter of Annie.\\" External links * * Category:1997 films Category:Canadian films Category:Films directed by Mark Rosman Category:1997 science fiction films Category:Canadian science fiction films ","title":"The Invader (1997 film)"},{"id":"24553578","text":"The 1987 Santiago de Chuco earthquake struck Peru on October 2 with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong).

It is a generalization of the two-parameter gamma distribution. Since many distributions commonly used for parametric models in survival analysis (such as the Exponential distribution, the Weibull distribution and the Gamma distribution) are special cases of the generalized gamma, it is sometimes used to determine which parametric model is appropriate for a given set of data.Box-Steffensmeier, Janet M.; Jones, Bradford S. (2004) Event History Modeling: A Guide for Social Scientists. Cambridge University Press. (pp. 41-43) Another example is the half-normal distribution. Characteristics The generalized gamma has three parameters: a > 0, d > 0, and p > 0. For non-negative x, the probability density function of the generalized gamma isStacy, E.W. (1962). \\"A Generalization of the Gamma Distribution.\\" Annals of Mathematical Statistics 33(3): 1187-1192. : f(x; a, d, p) = \\\\frac{(p/a^d) x^{d-1} e^{-(x/a)^p}}{\\\\Gamma(d/p)}, where \\\\Gamma(\\\\cdot) denotes the gamma function. The cumulative distribution function is : F(x; a, d, p) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma(d/p, (x/a)^p)}{\\\\Gamma(d/p)} , where \\\\gamma(\\\\cdot) denotes the lower incomplete gamma function. The quantile function can be found by noting that F(x; a, d, p) = G((x/a)^p) where G is the cumulative distribution function of the Gamma distribution with parameters \\\\alpha = d/p and \\\\beta = 1. The quantile function is then given by inverting F using known relations about inverse of composite functions, yielding: : F^{-1}(q; a, d, p) = a \\\\cdot \\\\big[ G^{-1}(q) \\\\big]^{1/p}, with G^{-1}(q) being the quantile function for a Gamma distribution with \\\\alpha = d/p,\\\\, \\\\beta = 1. If d=p then the generalized gamma distribution becomes the Weibull distribution. Alternatively, if p=1 the generalised gamma becomes the gamma distribution. Alternative parameterisations of this distribution are sometimes used; for example with the substitution α = d/p.Johnson, N.L.; Kotz, S; Balakrishnan, N. (1994) Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 1, 2nd Edition. Wiley. (Section 17.8.7) In addition, a shift parameter can be added, so the domain of x starts at some value other than zero. If the restrictions on the signs of a, d and p are also lifted (but α = d/p remains positive), this gives a distribution called the Amoroso distribution, after the Italian mathematician and economist Luigi Amoroso who described it in 1925.Gavin E. Crooks (2010), The Amoroso Distribution, Technical Note, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Kullback-Leibler divergence If f_1 and f_2 are the probability density functions of two generalized gamma distributions, then their Kullback-Leibler divergence is given by : \\\\begin{align} D_{KL} (f_1 \\\\parallel f_2) & = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f_1(x; a_1, d_1, p_1) \\\\, \\\\ln \\\\frac{f_1(x; a_1, d_1, p_1)}{f_2(x; a_2, d_2, p_2)} \\\\, dx\\\\ & = \\\\ln \\\\frac{p_1 \\\\, a_2^{d_2} \\\\, \\\\Gamma\\\\left(d_2 / p_2\\\\right)}{p_2 \\\\, a_1^{d_1} \\\\, \\\\Gamma\\\\left(d_1 /p_1\\\\right)} \\\\+ \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\psi\\\\left( d_1 / p_1 \\\\right)}{p_1} + \\\\ln a_1 \\\\right] (d_1 - d_2) \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma\\\\bigl((d_1+p_2) / p_1 \\\\bigr)}{\\\\Gamma\\\\left(d_1 / p_1\\\\right)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{a_1}{a_2} \\\\right)^{p_2} \\\\- \\\\frac{d_1}{p_1} \\\\end{align} where \\\\psi(\\\\cdot) is the digamma function.C.

High school and collegiate career Michael Watson attended prep school at St. Paul's School in Brooklandville, Maryland, where he was a high school All-American. He played NCAA Division I lacrosse at the University of Virginia from 1994 and 1997. As a prolific attackman, Watson garnered numerous awards and helped lead the Virginia Cavaliers to two NCAA national championship appearances, one in 1994 and one in 1996. In both title games, however, Princeton defeated Virginia by one goal in overtime. Watson was a four-time All-American attackman, having been named to the Third Team in 1994, Second Team in 1995, and First Team in 1996 and 1997. In addition, he was named by the USILA as Attackman of the Year for Division I in 1996 (Lt. Col. Jack Turnbull Award). Watson was also named All-ACC four times, picked as the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 NCAA Tournament, named the 1994 ACC Rookie of the Year, was selected to play in 1997 North-South Senior All-Star Game, and was named one of the 50 greatest lacrosse players in ACC history in 2002. Watson ranks second for most career goals at Virginia with 142 goals in 62 games, behind teammate Doug Knight's 165 goals in 60 games. The Virginia attack unit consisting of Watson, Doug Knight, and Tim Whiteley is regarded as among the best of all time, leading the nation in offensive output and setting several ACC records. Watson was also selected for the 1998 U.S. National Team and scored 12 goals and 8 assists for 20 total points in the 1998 World Lacrosse Championship held in Baltimore, Maryland. Watson and Virginia teammate Doug Knight are credited with popularizing \\"the dive\\" or \\"the dive shot,\\"http://video.insidelacrosse.com/video/view/XInDNAd_G3tGy93lNYIMIw/il-on- espn--the-divehttp://www.laxtips.com/tips/profiles/watson.htm an acrobatic move where an offensive player attacks the goal from behind the net by diving airborne through the goal crease while shooting the ball at the goal while in mid-air. The NCAA subsequently banned this practice in 1998 due to safety concerns and difficulty in officiating the play.http://video.insidelacrosse.com/video/view/XInDNAd_G3tGy93lNYIMIw/il-on- espn--the-dive Professional career Watson played professional outdoor lacrosse for the Major League Lacrosse team the Boston Cannons from 2001 to 2004. In 2002, he played in all 14 regular season games and led the team in assists and picked up 28 groundballs. In 2003, he scored 31 points and was selected to the MLL All-Star Team. In 2004, Watson scored 39 goals with eight assists for 47 total points, including a six-goal game against the Rochester Rattlers. He scored 20 goals in four games, which is the best four-game stretch in MLL history.http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=166 The Cannons selected Watson as Offensive Player of the Year. In addition, Inside Lacrosse magazine named him \\"The MLL's Most Electrifying Player\\" in 2004. Following a year off from the sport, Watson returned to the MLL in 2006 as the first overall draft pick by the Los Angeles Riptide.http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/communitysports/20060528-9999-m1sc28riptid.html He played in 12 games and notched 40 points and one game-winning goal. In 2007, he appeared in all 12 Riptide games and led the team in goals with 31, and was second on the team in points with 40. He scored two game-winning goals and picked up 24 groundballs. He also scored five goals in a game three times and was named to the 2007 MLL Western Conference All-Star team. In 2008, Watson scored 10 goals and 11 assists and scooped up 15 groundballs. The Los Angeles Riptide ceased operations before the 2009 season due to the economic downturn in the United States. Watson is the model for the Major League Lacrosse logo.

It is also found in New Guinea and eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi and Maluku).Beasley, John. (2009). Plants of Cape York: The Compact Guide. John Beasley, Kuranda, Qld., Australia. . p. 385.  Description  Dendrobium smillieae is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with crowded, ribbed, greenish or yellowish spindle-shaped pseudobulbs long and wide. The psudobulbs have leaves during their first year, but are leafless at maturity. The leaves are bright green, thin, often twisted, long and wide. The flowers are arranged in crowded, bottlebrush-like groups long on the end of the pseudobulbs. The flowers are white, greenish, cream-coloured or pink, more or less tube-shaped and long. The sepals and petals are blunt, long and do not open widely. The labellum is about long, wide with a shiny, dark green tip. Flowering occurs from August to November. A white variety is found in the Sepik swamps in New Guinea.Teoh, Eng-Soon. (2005) Orchids of Asia. New & Expanded Third Edition. Times Editions - Marshall Cavendish. . p. 124. Taxonomy and naming Dendrobium smillieae was first formally described in 1867 by Ferdinand von Mueller from a specimen collected near Rockingham Bay by John Dallachy. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (smillieae) honours E.J. Smillie. Distribution and habitat The bottlebrush orchid is widespread and common, growing on trees and sometimes on rocks, in woodland, forest and rainforest margins. It prefers trees which are exposed to sunlight and commonly grows on trees such as Lophostemon suaveolens (swamp turpentine or swamp box) which have loose papery bark. The roots of the orchid penetrate below the bark and form large mats which are well protected beneath the bark. It is found in New Guinea, including on the Bismarck Archipelago, on the Aru Islands, on some Torres Strait Islands and on the Cape York Peninsula as far south as Townsville.Beasley, John (2006). Plants of Tropical North Queensland the Compact Guide. Footloose Publications. Kuranda, Qld., Australia. . pp. 57, 73. Ecology The flowers of this orchid produce nectar and are pollinated by the yellow honeyeater (Stomiopera flava) also known in Queensland as the canary honeyeater. The bird hovers in front of the flowers while feeding on the nectar.

On entering Cambridge, he continued his passion for sport and was selected for the Cambridge University team. He played in three University Varsity Matches, collecting his sporting 'Blues' between 1893 and 1895. On leaving University he joined Blackheath, and would later becoming a leading member of the Kent county team, and was invited to join the touring Barbarian team in 1894. Todd spent the major portion of his rugby career with first- class English team, Blackheath F.C., and was representing the club when he was approached by team-mate Johnny Hammond to join the 1896 British Isles tour of South Africa.Alex Todd Lions profile lionsrugby.com Todd was one of four Blackheath players on the tour, along with Hammond, Matthew Mullineux and Froude Hancock. Todd played in all four Tests against the South African national team, which ended in three wins for the tourists, and a loss in the final game played at Cape Town. In the Second Test, which the British team won by the largest margin, all three tries came from forward positions, one of them was scored by Todd; his first and only international points. On his return to Britain, Todd rejoined Blackheath, and was still a club member when four years later he was capped by his country as part of the 1900 Home Nations Championship. In the opening match of the tournament against Wales, the English selectors had gambled on 13 new caps, and lost the game. In the second game of the series, played against Ireland at the Athletic Ground in Richmond, Todd was given his chance, and he was brought into a more stable side than the previous match. England won 15-4. Todd was then reselected for the final game of the Championship, an away encounter with Scotland. The game was extremely tight, with the English halves reluctant to bring the backs into play, and the game ended in a 0-0 draw. As Scotland were the holders of the Calcutta Cup, the draw meant they retained the trophy, and England finished second in the Championship behind Wales.

The nearest city is York. From 1947 to 1998 Scriven was part of the Claro Registration District, until this was abolished. It is situated north-west of the A6055 road from Bond End and situated north-east of the B6165 Ripley Road. Scriven-with-Tentergate was a parish however in modern days it is now known as Scriven due to a boundary change. The name Scriven originally meant \\"Hollow-place\\" with pits and could have referred to the quarrying that occurred nearby. Tentergate however contains the derivative \\"gate\\", which is the Scandinavian translation for street, and was the place where cloth was stretched for drying.  Early history Scriven was included in 1066 and 1086 in the Domesday Book. In 1066 the Lord was King Edward and the value to the Lord was £6. In 1086 however, the Lord was King William and the value decreased to just £1. There were 26 ploughlands, which was land available for growing crops and the taxable value was 44.9 geld units. Scriven was one of eleven berewicks in 1086 of the Knaresborough manor and remains close to the town. Due to the close proximity and deep history between the two, there are no churches in Scriven, village residents travelled (and still do) to churches in the town to worship. In the 1870s, Scriven was described as: :SCRIVEN-WITH-TENTERGATE, a township in Knaresborough parish, W. R. Yorkshire; on the river Nidd, 1 mile N by W of Knaresborough. Acres, 1, 767. Real property, £5, 901; of which £40 are in gas-works. Pop., 1, 426. Houses, 353. The manor belonged anciently to the Scrivens; passed, in the time of Henry III., to the Slingsbys; and, with S. Hall, belongs now to SirSlingsby, Bart. Conyngarth Saxon camp and Gates-hill Danish camp are near the Hall. Occupation structure The pie chart below shows the occupational structure of Scriven in 1881. Historically Scriven's history was primarily agriculture which can be seen from the pie chart. Although majority of the occupations remain unknown, the data does show that of the known occupations vast were involved in the agricultural industry. However, if we compare this data with information from the 2011 Census data it can be seen that no-one in Scriven is involved in the agricultural industry. As society changed throughout time there became a shift in industry with most economically active residents in Scriven working in the wholesale and retail trade. Pie Chart showing the occupational structure of Scriven in 1881 Population According to the 2011 census it had a population of 233. Due to the change in parish boundary, from Scriven with Tentergate to Scriven on 31 December 1894, the population also reflects this and there seems to be a sudden decrease. It is difficult to account for these population changes as the figures do fluctuate. The 2011 figures are very similar to the 1901 figures despite being 110 years difference. However, there are limitations to the population graph due to lack of historical data. Population of Scriven 1881–2011 The graph supports the fact that there was the boundary change in 1894 resulting in Tentergate becoming a new civil parish. When the 1901 census was taken it showed how the population had decreased drastically from 615 in 1891 to 273, because of the change in boundaries. Modern Scriven In 2006, after Winifred Jacob Smith, a North Yorkshire resident, died she left what is known now as Jacob Smith Park, 30 acres of land which was turned into a public park. In 2012 Scriven made the news again, after a 200-year-old oak tree in Jacob Smith Park had fallen revealing a nest of 6,000 honeybees. Jacob Smith Park Education There are no schools in the area. The nearest primary school is St Mary's Catholic School in Knaresborough which is 0.7 miles away. The nearest secondary school is The Forest School which is a Special school and is 1.1 miles away.

The name is an acronym for \\"Work at Home Moms,\\" though the magazine covers issues affecting all home-based business workers and telecommuters, both male and female. History Software engineer Cheryl Demas founded WAHM in 1994 while herself a work at home mother. The site was initially targeted at stay-at-home mothers who had started home-based side businesses. As telecommuting grew in popularity in corporate America, and later, as corporations tapped home-based workers as part of outsourcing efforts, WAHM's focus widened to include home-based workers of all types. This includes people with small home side businesses and telecommuters working from home for companies of all sizes. WAHM was acquired by Internet Brands in 2008 . Site Functionality WAHM features a magazine-style layout with a large library of articles related to the work-at-home lifestyle. The site also features home- based job listings and a discussion forum . Because home-based business scams have grown in popularity, a large portion of the content on WAHM is focused on scams and how to avoid them. WAHM's discussion forum is one of the places of the internet where readers can report work-at-home scams and read about them. The site founder Cheryl Demas sometimes goes undercover and then she reports the scams that she has discovered in this way.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on September 15, 2009 as a sequel to the earlier Zuma, and was later ported to Windows Phone. It features high-definition graphics, new levels and 'power- ups,' several new features, as well as boss battles. On February 22, 2011, a version was introduced for Nintendo DS which features daily challenges, versus mode and achievements.Twitter  Gameplay  As in Zuma, the main objective of Zuma's Revenge! is to clear strings of rolling balls, or 'stones', by matching balls of the same color. Players move a ball-shooting frog which always points in the direction of the mouse to aim and fire balls at these strings. When three or more balls of the same color match together, they are cleared from the playfield. This clearing creates gaps through which a player may shoot more balls at nearby strings, target bonus fruit, and 'power-up' stones. Gaps automatically close if the balls at either end of the gap are (or become) the same color, potentially creating chain reaction matching and clearing as new sets of three or more are formed. The strings of balls constantly roll along their tracks toward a skull emblem at the end. Should they reach the emblem, the player loses a life, and the game is over when the player has lost all of his or her lives. However, unlike in the original Zuma in which regardless of stage, they are allowed to play stage one of the temple again; when the player gets a game over, they will start again at the checkpoint (stage one of an area if the player loses before the mid-level and stage six if the same situation happens in stages six to ten). The strings are always \\"pushed\\" by the last ball in the string, so any balls not connected to the rearmost string do not move on their own. Periodically, random balls display power-ups which the player may collect by destroying the ball. These include a visual guide to show where a ball will land when shot, power-ups that slow down or reverse the direction of the string, a three-way cannon that blasts through all layers of balls, a laser that can destroy single balls, a bomb, and a lightning power-up which destroys all balls of a specific color. Zuma's Revenge! introduces three types of levels that are new to the series. Some levels feature two lily pads that the frog can jump between, while other levels set the frog on a horizontal or vertical track and enable it to slide side-to-side or up-and- down rather than rotate to aim. There are also boss levels where the player has to shoot balls towards the enemies to reduce their hit points while simultaneously preventing the ball string(s) from reaching the skull emblem. The enemies in turn shoot projectiles that will induce a certain gimmick if they hit the player. These levels have an unlimited number of lives, so if any single ball reaches the emblem, the player will simply restart the level, since there is no game over in boss levels.  Game modes  The game features four game modes. In Adventure mode, the player progresses through a Polynesian-style island ruled by the angry god Zhaka Mu. Every five levels, the player is awarded a checkpoint at which he or she can restart the game if all lives are lost. At the end of each island area, the player encounters a tiki god and must face the god in a boss battle. Clearing Adventure mode for the first time unlocks the Heroic Frog and Iron Frog modes. Gameplay of the Heroic Frog is the same as Adventure, but it is considerably more difficult. In Iron Frog, the player has to progress through ten levels with only one life and the mode is an even more difficult than Heroic Frog. In each mode except Challenge mode, the player must reach a general point goal to achieve \\"Zuma\\", at which point the level stops adding balls to the string(s) and the string(s) move(s) backwards. The player must then clear all of the remaining balls from the playfield to move on to the next level. In Challenge mode, the player has three minutes to score as many points as possible, collecting power-ups which increase their score multiplier along the way. Reception Zuma's Revenge! received fairly positive reviews from critics on Metacritic and GameRankings.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System announced in a press release on Saturday, May 2, 2008 that the proposed rules, \\"prohibit unfair practices regarding credit cards and overdraft services that would, among other provisions, protect consumers from unexpected increases in the rate charged on pre-existing credit card balances.\\" Provisions addressing credit card practices aim to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards and improve the credit card disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act: * Banks would be prohibited from increasing the rate on a pre-existing credit card balance (except under limited circumstances) and must allow the consumer to pay off that balance over a reasonable period. * Banks would be prohibited from applying payments in excess of the minimum in a manner that maximizes interest charges. * Banks would be required to give consumers the full benefit of discounted promotional rates on credit cards by applying payments in excess of the minimum to any higher-rate balances first, and by providing a grace period for purchases where the consumer is otherwise eligible. * Banks would be prohibited from imposing interest charges using the \\"two-cycle\\" method, which computes interest on balances on days in billing cycles preceding the most recent billing cycle. * Banks would be required to provide consumers a reasonable amount of time to make payments. The proposal would also address subprime credit cards by limiting the fees that reduce the available credit. In addition, banks that make firm offers of credit advertising multiple rates or credit limits would be required to disclose in the solicitation the factors that determine whether a consumer will qualify for the lowest rate and highest credit limit. The proposal has been placed in the Federal Register. Withdrawal and subsequent developments This 2008 regulatory proposal under Regulation AA was not finalized and was ultimately withdrawn. It was replaced by final regulations that the Federal Reserve Board issued to regulate practices under Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act) for credit card practices and Regulation E (Electronic Fund Transfer Act) for deposit account overdrafts stemming from debit card and ATM card transactions.

The centre uses six venues used in the 2016 games in addition to a number of new facilities created in the Barra Olympic Park footprint. The centre became a campus of training facilities for Olympic and Paralympic athletes at the site of the former Nelson Piquet International Autodrome - Jacarepaguá as a legacy of the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2016 Summer Paralympics. Purpose Its main purpose is to centralize the infrastructure required for the development of Brazilian athletes, including teaching and training, with the help of professionals and scientific education. It is inspired and follows similar projects from other countries like the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, Australia, United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, and the English Institute of Sport. The first sports to be offered at Brazil's Olympic Training Center will be athletics, boxing, fencing, water sports, gymnastics, wrestling, judo, taekwondo, table tennis, archery, tennis, badminton and weightlifting. Construction begun in 2009, and was finished in 2016. Funds were planned to come from the Ministry of Sports, from sponsorship contracts and tax incentive laws. Selection The Olympic Training Center’s operations will be managed by an agenda elaborated according to the main national and international sports events. Following to this calendar, interns in relevant sports will be invited. During this period, the athletes will undergo a battery of tests and will use the physical and professional structure to support their training. At the end, the athletes and the technical committee will return home to continue the training and disseminate knowledge acquired. Venues and facilities The Olympic Training Center encompasses eight permanent sport facilities in the Barra da Tijuca region. Two were part of the City of Sports Complex established for the 2007 Pan American Games: the HSBC Arena and the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center. A third venue, the Barra Velodrome was demolished and replaced by the Rio Olympic Velodrome. Along with those, two indoor arenas, Carioca Arenas 1 and 2, an Olympic Tennis Center (a Tennis stadium with 15 ancillary courts) and the Olympic Aquatics Stadium.Olympic Games Facilities: Barra Region Rio de Janeiro Olympic venues map The Olympic Tennis stadium has a seating capacity of 8,250 spectators, the Olympic Velodrome 5,000 spectators and the Olympic Aquatics Stadium 18,000 spectators. Arena Carioca 1 (capacity of 16,000 spectators) hosted the Olympic basketball games, and the Paralympic wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby games. Arena Carioca 2 (capacity of 10,000 spectators) hosted the Olympic judo and wrestling events, and the Paralympic boccia events. Arena Carioca 3 (capacity of 10,000 spectators) hosted the Olympic taekwondo and fencing competitions and the Paralympic judo and wheelchair fencing tournaments. Future Arena (a temporary structure to be re- purposed after the Games) has a capacity of 12,000 spectators and hosted the Olympic handball matches, and the Paralympic goalball matches. The venues also have infrastructure to provide services in nutrition, physiotherapy & sports medicine, athlete career support, physiological, biomechanical, psychological and biochemical assessment as well as lecture halls & seminar rooms for education of the athletes.

Biography Lehmann joined the Berlin Police force in 1911. In 1920 he became deputy division chief of anti- espionage. In 1929 Lehmann began providing information for the NKVD. He did this not out of communist sympathy, but because he was married, also had a girlfriend, and needed money. In addition, he had a fondness for betting on horses.Uwe Klussmann: Stalins Mann in der Gestapo. der Spiegel. 29 September 2009 In 1933 Lehmann joined the Gestapo. The NKVD code name for the Gestapo was Apotheke (pharmacy). In the Gestapo Lehmann became director of the division combating Soviet espionage. Thanks to Lehmann's information, the Soviets were able to free their agent Arnold Deutsch, who later recruited Kim Philby.Hans Coppi: Willy Lehmann; in: Hans Schafranek und Johannes Tuchel (Eds.):Krieg im Äther. Widerstand und Spionage im Zweiten Weltkrieg. Picus Verlag: Wien 2004, Lehmann entered the SS in 1934. Toward the end of June, Hermann Göring asked Lehmann to help organize the Röhm Putsch to liquidate opponents of the regime. Lehmann later told the NKVD that the murders he committed during the Night of the Long Knives sickened him. But at the same time they solidified his position with his Gestapo superiors. In 1939 Lehmann transferred to the Reich Main Security Office, division IV. His responsibility was to prevent the Soviets from spying on the German armaments industry. This position enabled Lehmann to provide valuable information to the Soviets about German armaments. On 19 June 1941, Lehmann reported to the NKVD the exact date on which the Germans planned to invade the Soviet Union. Operation Barbarossa was launched on 22 June 1941. His message was telegraphed to Beria and Stalin, who noted in green ink \\"disinformation\\" on Lehmann's intelligence report. In 1942, with the Germans' discovery of the Red Orchestra, Lehmann was arrested and shot without trial on orders of Heinrich Himmler, who at the same time had the entire matter hushed up.

The school taught from New Entrant to Year 13 (Form 7). The classes were fairly small, some having less than 15 people. History In 1977, the Auckland Christian Fellowship Church set up the school. The pastor, Rob Wheeler, had visited Christian schools in the United States earlier that decade, and wanted to set up a school with a similar perspective in New Zealand. The school began with Claude Warner as principal, and 45 pupils. It was called the Christian Fellowship School, and was in the basement of Haddon Hall in Auckland City. At that point, the school was using Accelerated Christian Education material, from the US. In 1980 this was discontinued due to the distinctly American nature of ACE's content. The school switched to New Zealand's traditional infant programme. In 1981, a new site in Mt Albert was purchased from the Karitane Nursing Trust and the wards modified into classrooms. This is the school's present site. Francine Bennett had been acting principal for two terms when Bob Eastland was appointed Principal in 1982. His tenure proved short-lived however, as his resignation due to ill health was received toward the end of that year. Ms Bennett became the principal in 1983. Under her leadership the secondary school was started. In 1985, Bev Norsworthy became principal. She reinstated the enrolment policy. Economic crisis in the late 1980s meant that the school, now with a capacity for 220 students, was in financial trouble. The Mt Albert site was put up for sale as the school searched for larger premises, but eventually the decision was made to remain at that location. In 1990, the Institute in Basic Life Principles purchased the property and leased it back to the school at a low rate. The same year the school became independent of the Auckland Christian Fellowship. It is now operated by the Biblical Education Services Trust. Geoff Matthews was appointed Associate Principal in 1991 and replaced Mrs Norsworthy, who resigned to set up MASTERS Institute, a Christian teachers college, as principal at the start of 1993. In [need date] MASTERS Institute became the School of Education at Laidlaw College. In February 1998, the school board's application for a roll increase to 320 students was granted. The buildings were developed to accommodate this growth. The school has applied for integration with the state-funded education system several times. This application has been denied by the Minister of Education, who was Chris Carter at the time. In 2011 Allan Ross Randall, a former teacher at the school, was jailed for two years for sexual touching of eleven students between 2007 and 2011. The school officially closed in December 2017.

Privy digging is the process of locating and investigating the contents of defunct outhouse vaults. The purpose of privy digging is the salvage of antique bottles and everyday household artifacts from the past. Privy digging is a form of historical digging and is often conducted on private residential properties. Construction sites and major developments around older areas of towns and cities are also likely places to look for evidence of privies. Historical contractors (privy diggers who dare to enter into contracts enabling them to investigate vaults on commercial or industrial properties) are also engaging in privy digging. Privies are also called pits, holes, and chambers. In some locations, like New York City, vaults are sometimes referred to as “wells”, due to their appearance and often considerable depth. In these instances well digging is synonymous with privy digging.  Academic controversies  There are controversies regarding who should be permitted to investigate private residential privies and the historical significance of what is found in them. From a conventional academic perspective, it is assumed that all privies contain vital and unique information which cannot be found elsewhere and that a costly forensic approach is required. Privy diggers who are not professional archaeologists are labeled “looters”, even while working on sites which are in the process of being destroyed or have already been examined and worked by archaeologists. While both parties are engaging in similar activities, each is confronted with very different logistics, constraints, and unique opportunities for genuine discovery. US academics responding to the threat of privy digging, dump digging, metal detecting, and so on have helped create laws protecting objects of a certain age, usually only 50–100 years old, from exploitation by opportunistic looters and other thieves that disturb historic context in pursuit of treasure. Laws intended to safeguard legitimate national and cultural treasures are applied to any item found while digging. Privies Privies can be constructed of stone, brick, or wood and vary considerably from place to place. Some privy vaults are less than 2 feet deep and others are more than 25 feet. They can be as narrow as 2 feet or as wide as 10 feet, particularly in urban settings where a large privy shed with multiple doors and inner compartments once stood. Some vaults are cylindrical, these are usually made of stone or brick. Though there are cylindrical privies that are actual wooden barrels placed in the ground. Others are rectangular and commonly made of stone, brick, or wood. Many shallower rectangular vaults were only wood-lined. Many privies were cleaned out periodically (“dipped”). This routine process addressed the growing concern for foul odors and airborne illnesses which was prevalent at the time. Dipping also provided some of the necessary organic material for the fertilizer industry. Around the time that modern plumbing was installed, many were cleaned out and backfilled with newer material. These dipped vaults do not have an undisturbed night soil layer and the probability of one containing anything of major archaeological importance is extremely low.  Sites  Excavating a small wood-lined privy located behind a residence which was built around 1876. Most privies are located behind the building or buildings which they served. In major urban areas, such as older cities on the US east coast, they are commonly found in the rear section of the residential lot and their size will vary considerably from place to place. Old fire insurance maps, such as Sanborn, indicate that some properties were several lots wide and sometimes had two or more houses within the same boundary line. In these instances only one privy vault may exist for all the houses being considered or one may exist for each. In other cases structures apparently had no outlying property at all. It is assumed that these particular vaults were incorporated into a neighboring lot or perhaps placed within the structure itself somewhere, possibly the basement. Some insurance maps show outbuildings and sheds, and occasionally privy outlines too. For example, 19th century insurance maps for New York City generally do not have markings indicating privy placements and some for New Jersey do. However, when researching the latter, privy diggers find no evidence that a privy ever existed where the map outline indicates one should be. Investigating a barren wood-lined privy (ca. 1840). Some privy diggers also research excavation sites where old houses and other buildings, such as factories, saloons, and hotels once were. The use of heavy machinery can lead to indications of stone or brick structures and other subterranean anomalies being unearthed. This in turn can lead to discoveries of privies, cisterns, root cellars, and trash pits. Managers and owners of construction sites may not accommodate privy diggers on their missions to salvage on these sites. Some of them are enthusiasts themselves and agreements can be formed allowing diggers to search for privy vaults and landfill deposits. Some historical diggers focus exclusively on these kinds of sites and over time develop good relations with various development companies. Permission to salvage on these sites can lead to remarkable discoveries with relatively little physical effort but this is the exception to the rule. Locating the privy vault When a property is determined to be old enough to have had an outhouse somewhere within its original boundaries, probing and test digging are the common methods for finding it. The basic probe is made of spring steel and between 4’ and 6’ feet in length. Many variations exist and each locale being probed has its own peculiarities regarding which equipment and what techniques should be applied. Adept privy diggers develop considerable skill interpreting the faint residues which come up on the end of a probe and the subtle noise variations encountered while sliding it in and out of the ground. Test digging involves making a small hole, and going down a few feet, to determine that a probe reading is accurate. Once something other than dirt and rocks are being encountered and man-made objects are buried deeply in a particular spot, the outline of the privy is carefully excavated. This can take hours or days depending on its size and the materials being dug through. Dug dirt or “fluff” as it is sometimes called, is systematically removed from the hole by shoveling. Deeper holes require a rope and bucket setup and sometimes a tripod mechanism to assist with the removal of material. Privy maintenance and garbage disposal salvage dig excavators encountered an array of antique bottles and other interesting items which were manufactured in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s. Due to extreme odors and overfilling, a high percentage of privy vaults were cleaned out, to varying levels, while still in use. This is commonly referred to as “dipping” among privy diggers. The amount of dipping that occurred, how far down a well material was cleared and how frequently it was cleared, varied from privy to privy. After plumbing was installed at the residence there was a final cleaning, which had a tendency of removing everything down to the deepest level of the vault. Even at depths reaching 30 feet or more, some of the deepest vaults known to exist, many were cleaned to the base. Alternatively, a small percentage of shallow vaults extending down about 3 feet or less have contained noteworthy bottles, numerous fragments of dinner plates, cups, bowls, pitchers, tobacco pipes, clam and oyster shells, food bones and even sparse night soil pockets around the edges. During the mid 19th century operators connected to the booming waste-generated fertilizer (night soil) business circulated cities and towns emptying vaults. In rural areas where vaults are usually much smaller and shallower farmers and other property owners often conducted this task themselves. Despite lying in human waste and other decaying refuse for years, many recyclable bottles of the time, and other reusable items, were retrieved during the dipping process. Genuine garbage would be taken to landfills and other suitable locations and dumped, along with a never ending supply of stove and fireplace ashes. The evidence suggests that not all dippers were equally concerned with being meticulous and periodically dozens of bottles, and even some night soil, can still be found while privy digging. The many out of place bottles sometimes discovered in clusters near the top or bottom of a dipped out vault are referred to by diggers as “kick-backs”, or “throw-ins”, and were left intentionally by the workers who cleaned out the privy. Throughout the decades of the middle and late 19th century, the years diggers tend to focus on due to rapid changes in bottle manufacturing, privies were only incidental or sporadic dumping spots for bottles, kitchen garbage and other refuse. Some privies were never used for that purpose at all and for practical reasons only a very small percentage of a household’s total trash could ever be distributed there. Due to the enormous quantities of everyday garbage being produced by this time in history, not to mention the hundreds of millions of bottles sold each year in the United States alone, the vaults would have filled up very quickly requiring constant maintenance instead of being emptied just every so often. Moreover, it was generally acceptable to dump reeking trash just about anywhere then without worrying about legal consequences. Preferred places were lowland areas near the edges of towns and cities, down embankments and into ravines, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, bogs, shorelines, backyard burning pits and other locales. For example, New York City sent scows brimming with garbage out into the harbor everyday where very cheap labor shoveled it directly into the water without a second thought. This process went on for centuries and an endless supply of collectable items, antiques and archaeological information alike remain in these dumping places to this day. A sterile mixture of dirt, sand, rocks, ashes, brick bats and other worthless debris manufactured around 1880-1920 was used to backfill privies once plumbing was installed at a particular address. With or without night soil deposits remaining down below there is no longer any offensive odor.  Items recovered  An iron pontiled soda or beer bottle, ca. 1855. Privy digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting. Glass or clay bottles are the most likely items to be found in an average 19th century privy. Yet, more often than not they are found prohibitively damaged. This may be due to the large number of brickbats and stones which are found at all levels of the privy. Excavators have theorized that at least some of them were thrown in with the intention of crushing down the contents of the vault, so it could be used longer without needing to be cleaned. The high percentage of broken items is one reason why privy digging is one of the most unpredictable and arduous methods of attempting to form a bottle collection. Pontiled medicine bottles, ink bottles, beer and soda bottles, and many others, particularly those manufactured between the 1830s-1860s are among the most sought after and can sell for thousands of dollars each. However, in reality an average pontiled find discovered while privy digging is worth less than twenty dollars. Even these are not discovered consistently in most locations. Not unlike old stamps and coins invariably they are required to be in mint or very good condition to be sufficiently interesting to a serious bottle collector. An enormous quantity of rare bottles are known to exist in private collections, museums, museum and university basements, and elsewhere but these prime examples are seldom found on average privy digs. In fact a high percentage of all valuable bottles and related containers were never buried in privies, dumps or elsewhere; these are known as “attic” bottles among privy diggers and bottle collectors. There are exceptions and over time some groups of regularly active diggers, operating in good locations, will encounter thousands of antique bottles and other interesting things. The vast majority of items will be very common examples of nominal value and not very useful to serious collectors, historians, or archaeologists. Not unlike dump diggers privy diggers may also encounter miscellaneous tableware (banded ware, redware, mocha, and other slipwares), stoneware, occasionally clay pipes, doll parts, tea set pieces, marbles, buttons, chamber pots, decorative porcelain pot lids and bases used for pomades and skin creams, bone or ivory toothbrush handles, hard-rubber combs and hair picks, ambrotypes, and other objects which are usually broken or damaged. Most of these items were valueless and intentionally discarded into the privy, others fell through the opening in the outhouse seat, and some were lost at the hands of small children. In each instance the insides of active vaults were very caustic environments, the highly toxic ingredients causing most things to break down and rot very quickly.  Related topics and history  Privy diggers, along with dump diggers and other historical diggers are enthusiastic about making their own discoveries and will get sufficiently dirty as a result. Though there are some exceptions this work is usually done by hand and requires a remarkable degree of persistence and tenacity. Career level diggers are obsessive by nature, sometimes achieving considerable skill with the various forms of privy digging techniques available. Some privy diggers also use a metal detector to pinpoint old coins and other easy to miss metal objects. Some privy diggers are metal detectorists and some metal detectorists are also privy diggers, dump diggers and so on. However, each designation is a specific subject on its own. Excavating a large stone-lined urban privy during a major property renovation (ca. 1851). Privy digging has things in common with dump digging and to some degree treasure hunting and garbology but is none of these exclusively as it involves salvaging the contents of defunct privies more than anything else. Privy digging and dump digging are equally concerned with antique bottles and related items. Though many exceptions exist in most instances even the oldest dump-bottles are not as old as privy bottles can be. Dumps are commonly associated with bottles and trash manufactured between the 1880s-1920s. This was a time when everyday bottles were being mass-produced annually by the hundreds of millions. They were reused less and often thrown away rather than recycled due to their relatively inexpensive production costs. Many bottles were still being mouth- blown and their lips formed by assorted tooling devices as late as 1915-20. The patent for the first fully automatic bottle machine, the Owens Automatic Bottle Machine, was not issued until 1903. And by 1906 it was swiftly replacing the old method at glasshouses nationwide. Early examples of machine made bottles manufactured between about 1906 and 1915 often resemble their predecessors in shape and color and can be nominally valuable for that reason. Whether found in privies or dumps late period mouth-blown bottles manufactured between about 1880-1915 have a lesser amount of serious collectable potential depending on rarity, condition and color. Dug bottles manufactured between 1880 and 1915 have sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars but statistically this is very rare. Although privy diggers usually attempt to focus on the contents of vaults built before the Civil War, these too can also contain bottles made as late as the 1920s or later up near the top. Depending on when a vault went into permanent disuse it could contain bottles and debris deposited as late as the second half of the 20th century. According to a 1950 census 50 million homes reported no indoor plumbing. In 1990 more than 4 million old style privies were still in use coast to coast. No matter what is encountered near the top assuming a given vault was active in 1850 its potential for older bottles lying at a lower section has a consistently strong draw for serious privy diggers. Whether mold blown or free blown (both forms of mouth-blowing and considered hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base. This mark is the result of removing the pontil rod. Something which was temporarily fused to the base in order to handle them effectively while they were still exceedingly hot, as their necks and lips were being tooled at the glassworks. The decades just prior to the absence of pontil rods from bottle-glass making were a time when endless variations pertaining to shape, size, style, color and embossing were being produced regularly in an unprecedented quantity. Some of the most interesting bottles were manufactured during this time; 1830s-1860s. Even after the pontil rod was replaced by assorted clamping mechanisms known as “snap cases”, many bottles were still being created in the same interesting molds and sold in huge quantities annually. These are known as smooth base bottles and are sometimes found in privies which were in use after the 1860s and as late as the 1880s. Visually, the difference between an early smooth base and a pontiled example of exactly the same bottle is insignificant but to a collector it often means everything. Rare early smooth base bottles can occasionally be as valuable as rare pontiled bottles but statistically they are unlikely to be discovered with any regularity on average privy digs.

It was formerly the Colorado Women’s College before merging with the University of Denver in 1982. History The Colorado Women’s College was founded in 1888 and opened its doors to its first students as a two-year college in 1909, with enrollment at 59 students its first year. Over the next ten years it changed into a four-year institution, and offered both BS and BA degrees. The 1920s and the 1930s brought change to the campus as two more buildings, the Foote and Porter Halls, were constructed. Meanwhile, the Colorado Women’s College once again became a two-year institution. In 1932, the college received accreditation by the North Central Association. The Chambers Center By 1967, enrollment at the Colorado Women’s College reached over 1,000 students and it switched back to being a four-year institution. At around the same time the Colorado Women’s College began a program targeting working women over the age of 25, which was a precursor to The Women’s College of today. However, it wasn’t until 1982, after a study conducted by both institutions, that the Colorado Women’s College merged with the University of Denver to form The Weekend College. University of Denver housed The Weekend College on their campus as they incorporated it with their College of Business. During the 1990s the Weekend College changed its name to its present-day name of The Woman’s College. This change coincided with The Women's College becoming an individual undergraduate college within the University of Denver’s academic system. In 2004, it moved into the Merle Catherine Chambers Center for the Advancement of Women. Merle Catherine Chambers Center for the Advancement of Women Opened in 2004, the Merle Catherine Chambers Center for the Advancement of Women currently houses The Women’s College of the University of Denver, The Women’s Foundation of Colorado, the Women in Engineering ProActive Network (WEPAN), and Higher Education Resource Services (HERS). Over 600 people contributed $9 million including a million dollar lead gift by Merle Chambers towards the construction of the center. The building has office spaces, multi-purpose meeting rooms, a technology center, and two gathering rooms to serve the needs of all the organizations.

Catalogue reference. The film goes behind the scenes of samba and Carnival to reveal the cultural and racial clash that gave birth to a new tradition in Rio de Janeiro. Synopsis In Samba on Your Feet (2006) the filmmakers go behind the carioca milieu to document samba and the Carnival. The one-hour documentary traces the influences that contributed to shaping the music that consecrated Carnival as one of the most powerful cultural manifestations in Brazil. Roots and perspectives, flesh and ghosts, entities and divinities spread across the slums and over the sidewalks of Salvador, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro are essential to the make-up of the Brazilian musical exponent par excellence.AfolabiIlê, \\"Niyi Aiyê in Brazil and the Reinvention of Africa\\", African Histories and modernities. p. 267 Palgrave Macmillan Samba on Your Feet introduces the voices of Cartola, Caetano Veloso, Ismael Silva, Clara Nunes, Clementina and many others whose perspectives on the cultural affairs of Rio de Janeiro have been carefully articulated with interviews of exponents of the Brazilian culture today. This dialogue between past and present takes place throughout the movie between precious scenes of archive footage from private collection and government resources. Samba on Your Feet was mostly shot in the marginal slums, in the umbanda terreiros, in the favelas where the less fortunate inhabitants of Rio strive to overcome overwhelming rates of crime and illiteracy to the rhythm and soul of the music they call samba.Filmmakers LibraryJanela Cultural.

The Kylie Minogue cover \\"On a Night Like This\\" from the EP can be found on Set in Stone as a bonus track. A video was made for the song \\"New Horizons\\" with footage from the first leg of their 2009 Australian tour that, according to the band, was filmed with a Nokia N95 mobile phone. The song includes a guest guitar solo by Pete Lesperance of Harem Scarem. \\"Be My Guest\\" is an instrumental track featuring guest solos from Craig Goldy of Dio, Glen Drover from Eidolon, Olof Mörck of Dragonland, Yoshiyasu Maruyama of the Japanese thrash band Argument Soul, Angra's Felipe Andreoli, the former Enter Twilight member Richie Hausberger, Chris Porcianko from Vanishing Point, Chris Brooks and former Dungeon members Stu Marshall and Justin Sayers.

The World Health Organization lists sexual relationship disorder in the ICD-10, under \\"Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation\\". The WHO describes it thus: > The gender identity or sexual orientation (heterosexual, homosexual, or > bisexual) is responsible for difficulties in forming or maintaining a > relationship with a sexual partner. () The WHO applies the following note to the entirety of part F66: \\"Sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder.\\"ICD-10: See part F66. A significant number of men and women experience conflict surrounding homosexual expression within a mixed-orientation marriage. Therapy may include helping the client feel more comfortable and accepting of same-sex feelings and to explore ways of incorporating same-sex and opposite-sex feelings into life patterns. Although a strong homosexual identity was associated with difficulties in marital satisfaction, viewing the same-sex activities as compulsive facilitated commitment to the marriage and to monogamy. Other LGBT people may want to have a family with an opposite-sex spouse. They may seek to change their sexual orientation. Research from the 1970s showed that a minority of patients who undergo therapy ultimately married someone of the opposite sex, though it is not clear what role therapy contributed to the marriage. Recent research does not permit any attribution of marital outcomes to therapy, though it appears that sexual orientation identity reconstruction can help clients develop a heterosexual orientation identity.Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation  See also  * Ego-dystonic sexual orientation * Homosexuality and psychology * Mixed-orientation marriage References External links  Category:Mental and behavioural disorders Category:Sexual orientation and psychology Category:Psychiatric diagnosis ","title":"Sexual relationship disorder"},{"id":"24554623","title":"1926 VFL Grand Final"},{"id":"24554639","text":"Exter is a suburb of the town Vlotho in the district of Herford, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

The song appeared as the eleventh track on Jackson's ninth studio album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, which was released in 1995 as a two-disc set. The song was written, composed, and produced by Michael Jackson, Jimmy Jam (James Harris III) and Terry Lewis. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" is a funk rock song, with lyrics that pertain to media bias and negative coverage of rumors about Jackson and his personal life, similar to previous songs recorded by Jackson. \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" is the seventh song on HIStory to be aimed at the media.  Background  Similarly to \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (1987), \\"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\\" (1991) and numerous fellow HIStory tracks, \\"Tabloid Junkie\\", co- written by Jackson, shows Jackson's dissatisfaction with the media, particularly the tabloids, because of the bias and negative media coverage of false rumors and the 1993 child sexual abuse accusations made against him. Ever since the late 1980s, Jackson and the press did not have a good relationship. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow the aging process, with a picture of him lying down in a glass box; Jackson stated that the story was untrue. When Jackson bought the pet chimpanzee Bubbles, the media viewed it as evidence of Jackson's increasing detachment from reality. It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph \\"The Elephant Man\\" Merrick; Jackson stated that the story was false.Taraborrelli, p. 355–361 These stories inspired the derogatory nickname \\"Wacko Jacko\\", which Jackson acquired the following year, and would come to despise. Jackson stopped leaking untrue stories to the press, so the media began making up their own.Taraborrelli, p. 370–373 In 1989, Jackson released the song and music video \\"Leave Me Alone\\", a song about his victimization at the hands of the press.Taraborrelli, p. 365 The video shows Jackson poking fun at both the press and himself. In the video, there are newspapers with bizarre headlines, Jackson dancing with the bones of \\"The Elephant Man\\", and an animated nose with a scalpel chasing it across the screen.Taraborrelli, p. 413 In August 1993, the relationship between Jackson and the press reached a boiling point when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Although never charged with a crime, Jackson was subject to intense media scrutiny while the criminal investigation took place. Complaints about the coverage included the media using sensational headlines to draw in readers and viewers when the content itself did not support the headline,Campbell (1995), p. 42–45 accepting leaked material from the police investigation and of Jackson's alleged criminal activity in return for money,Campbell (1995), p. 77–80 a lack of objectivityTaraborrelli, p. 500–507 and using headlines that strongly implied Jackson's guilt. At the time, Jackson said of the media coverage, \\"I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions.\\" Jackson began taking painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan to deal with the stress of the allegations made against him.Taraborrelli, p. 518–520 When he left the United States to go into rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy.Campbell (1995), p. 104–106  Composition  \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" is a funk rock song. Throughout the song, Jackson sings in a quick-voice, which some music critics viewed as Jackson \\"not singing\\" but \\"harrumphing\\". It is a plea to the public to not believe everything in the tabloids; and the lyrics are about media bias and sensational journalism about Jackson and in general. This can be heard in lyrics such as, \\"Just because you read it in the magazine or see it on the TV screen don't make it factual\\". Jackson uses the song to criticize journalists, commenting \\"with your pen you torture men\\", describing how he was affected by the media coverage about him, and \\"speculate to break the one you hate\\", describing how reporters used sensational writing to mislead people and cast him in a negative view. \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" is played in the key of E minor and in common time signature. It has heavy beats throughout with Jackson beatboxing throughout. Jackson's voice range is from C♭4 to D♭5. The songs tempo is moderate and its metronome is 111 beats per minute.  Reception  \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" received primarily positive reviews from contemporary music critics. James Hunter, a writer for Rolling Stone, described \\"Tabloid Junkie\\", as well as \\"Scream\\", another track from the album, as being \\"two adventurous Jam and Lewis thumpers\\" that \\"work completely\\", commenting that \\"Jackson's slippery voice is caught in mammoth funk-rock constructions\\". Hunter noted that the \\"choruses of 'Tabloid Junkie' in particular sing out with quick-voiced warnings about the failings of media truth.\\" Robert Christgau, a film and music critic, who gave the album ** Honorable Mention (), listed \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" as being one out of two of the album's highlights. Jim Farber, of the New York Daily News, commented that \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" sounded \\"like virtual satires\\" of the \\"beat-heavy sound devised\\" by Jam and Lewis in the 1980s. David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, noted that \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" comes as \\"close to transcendence as anywhere on the album\\" and described the chorus, \\"Just because you read it in the magazine or see it on the TV screen don't make it factual\\", as Jackson's \\"grabbiest, most driven refrain in years.\\" Although Browne praised the song, he commented, \\"The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time.\\" Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the \\"rust in songs\\" like \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" as having a \\"raw aspect\\" that Jackson \\"hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'.\\" Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that \\"Tabloid Junkie\\" was a \\"disingenuous attack on sensational news stories\\" about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were \\"planted\\" by Jackson himself.

The peak lies within the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area near Bonneville Dam. It is in elevation. Botanist David Douglas climbed to the summit in September 1825, making this the first recorded mountain ascent in what is now Washington state. An aerial view of the south face of Greenleaf Peak. Just south of the summit of Greenleaf Peak there is a dramatic escarpment called Red Bluffs, which connects Greenleaf Peak and Table Mountain. Approximately of the Eagle Creek formation are exposed at Red Bluffs. The Red Bluffs escarpment was created by the repeated collapse of Greenleaf Peak and Table Mountain. Massive landslides have fallen from the mountains, creating a area of debris called the Cascade Landslide Complex. The largest and most studied landslide is known as the Bonneville Slide, which created the Bridge of the Gods and Cascade Rapids The topography of the landslide complex is uneven with roughly rolling hills and abrupt slopes. The whole area is inclined south toward and beyond the Columbia River. There may have been a cinder cone between Greenleaf Peak and Table Mountain which collapsed during the Bonneville Slide. The Red Bluffs between Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak. The propensity of the area south of Greenleaf Peak and Table Mountain to collapse in landslides is due to the Eagle Creek formation. The rocks of the formation cover approximately of the Columbia River Gorge east of Cape Horn and consist of a mixture of past landslides, volcanic mud flows and ash falls. The formation is topped with basalt. Water can percolate through the basalt and saturate the Eagle Creek formation. In places where the formation is relatively close to the surface and inclined downslope, such as near Greenleaf Peak and Table Mountain, water saturation can cause the formation's material to slide away, carrying the overlying basalt with it. Between Greenleaf Peak and Table Mountain, and above the Red Bluffs, lies Greenleaf Basin. The basin averages in elevation and is covered with forested wetlands. Greenleaf Creek flows south through the basin before plunging as a waterfall over the Red Bluffs escarpment.

The Fantastic Journey is a video game published by Ubisoft and developed by Ludia based on the book of the same name. It is a puzzle adventure game released for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Microsoft Windows, and the iPhone, and is also a remake of The Great Waldo Search, released in 1992. Gameplay Like the other games in the series, the object of the game is to search for hidden characters and items within a time limit. Hints are awarded to the player through Woof, Waldo's pet dog. Woof alerts the players when they are near an object they are searching for. Players wanting to use this ability more often must collect 'Woof Bones' to prolong the effect.How to Play - Where's Waldo Unlike the NES video game adaptation of Where's Waldo? and The Great Waldo Search, which relied on a directional pad to search for targets, this game allows players to utilize more superior pointer-based motion controls (the Wii Remote's infrared sensor, the DS and iPhone's touchscreen, or a mouse, depending on the platform) to easily look for desired search targets.

It is located approximately north of Highway 1 and northeast of Brooks. Patricia is next to Dinosaur Provincial Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was named after Princess Patricia. The Hamlet of Patricia was briefly famous in the 1970s when a local rancher Albert Ketchmark gifted then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau a lot in the community as part of their mother's estate, as a joke. The Prime Minister's ownership of the 50 by 130 foot lot became national news when the County of Newell noted Trudeau owed $3 in property tax and possibly another $3 in back taxes on the property. The Prime Minister's Office when asked about the situation stated they were unaware of the transfer and had not been supplied with a deed transfer or tax bill. The taxes were paid by Jim Nesbitt, the publisher of the local Brooks Bulletin and Liberal Party member, and Trudeau refused to accept ownership of the lot, even just to transfer it to the County. The matter was settled in Supreme Court of Alberta when Trudeau's lawyers argued the transfer amounted to an imperfect gift, and the Justice ruled the property title cancelled.

He was on the faculty of the University of Chicago and the University of North Carolina and held positions in the American Library Association (ALA). He was included among the \\"100 most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\" by the American Library Association. Early life Lester Asheim was born on January 22, 1914 in Spokane, Washington. His family moved to Seattle, which is where he grew up until he went to the University of Washington. While there he earned two undergraduate degrees, one in English in 1936, and another in Librarianship in 1937. He also earned his Masters in American literature in 1941 from the same institution. When the United States entered World War II, Asheim joined the Army Signal Corps for three years. After his tour of duty, Asheim attended the University of Chicago. He earned his Ph.D in Librarianship from the University's graduate program in 1949. Academic life Asheims' first faculty position was at the University of Chicago, which started in 1948 while he was still attaining his Ph.D. He became dean in 1952 and held the position until he left the school in 1961. From 1961 until 1971 he held two different positions with the American Library Association (ALA). His first was Director of International relations until 1966, then he moved on to be the Director of the ALA's office for library education. Asheim left the ALA in 1971 to return to the University of Chicago as a faculty member. In 1975 he accepted a position as a faculty member at the University of North Carolina.

The Library and Science department at the University Of North Carolina has created a scholarship fund in his name. Contribution to library science Asheim made some of the most important contributions in Library science through his work on censorship in the library atmosphere. Asheim was an active librarian in a time of great growth in the library science community. His most famous article entitled \\"Not Censorship, But Selection\\" has become as ingrained to library science as the five laws of Ranganathan. Asheim's article articulated the difference between censorship and selection in several parts that address each of the problems that were associated with collection continuation. He presents and advocates several rules that librarians should follow in deciding what materials to include and exclude in their libraries' collections. Asheim's article is still cited by library science community decades later when dealing with the problems of cyber materials. The article \\"Lester Asheim in Cyberspace: A tribute to Sound reasoning\\" by June Pinnell-Stephens takes Asheim's arguments and applies them to the cyber age. Published works * * Asheim, L. E.

A founder of the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal, he also helped to establish the French colony of Montreal. Although a layman, as part of that objective, he was the founder of the Congregation of the Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph, Religious Sisters dedicated to the care of the sick poor. He has been declared Venerable by the Catholic Church.  Biography  He was born in La Flèche in the ancient Province of Maine on 18 March 1597, the younger son of Jérôme le Royer, first seigneur of La Dauversière, a local tax collector, and of Renée (or Marie) Oudin. His family originated in Brittany.Daveluy, Marie-Claire. \\"Chomedey De Maisonneuve, Paul De,\\" in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed June 19, 2013 Royer was one of the first pupils of the Jesuit Collège at La Flèche, founded in 1604 by King Henry IV of France. There he met Father Charles Lalemant, who had entered the Society of Jesus in 1607 and was ten years his senior, and also Father Paul Le Jeune, who had entered in 1613. In addition to the philosopher René Descartes, he had as fellow-students several of the great missionaries of New France, such as François Ragueneau, Claude Quentin, Charles Du Marché, and Jacques Buteux. With them, in 1614 he heard Father Énemond Massé speak of the Acadian missions, recently abandoned as a result of the English conquest. Upon the death of his father in the summer of 1619, Royer inherited the estate \\"La Dauversière\\", whence comes the title attached to his name, and his father's government post. He followed in his father's footsteps as a tax collector. In 1620 he married Jeanne de Baugé, with whom he had six children. Two of his sons would become priests, and both of his daughters became nuns. Holy Family Brotherhood On 2 February 1630, while at Mass, Dauversière felt that he had heard the calling to found a religious congregation of charitable young women in La Flèche dedicated to the Holy Family and under the special protection of St. Joseph for the service of the poor and the sick, especially in France's new colony in North America. Hesitating, he confided in his confessor, the Jesuit Father Chauveau, and various other priests who all dissuaded him from carrying out his plan. Possessed of firm piety, even though he was unclear as to the validity of the calling he felt, Dauversière and his brother Joseph organized charitable undertakings in his small town. He began by undertaking the renovation of the old Hôtel-Dieu (Hostel of God), where the sick poor of the city received care. He came to know Marie de la Ferre, who shared with him her calling to care for the sick and suffering. In February 1635, however, while at prayer at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, Dauversière experienced another vision which convinced him to go ahead with his plan. The Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph In May 1636, Marie de la Ferre and Anne Foureau committed themselves to lives of religious service at the Hotel-Dieu with three servants of the poor already working there. Thus began the Congregation of the Daughters Hospitallers of St. Joseph. In 1643 the first constitutions of the new congregation were approved and on 22 January 1644, Ferre and eleven companions made simple vows for one year in the Congregation of the Daughters of St. Joseph. Then they proceeded to the election of Marie de la Ferre as superior of the newly born community. The congregation gradually established houses in other French towns.  Montreal  With the Parisian priest Jean-Jacques Olier, founder of the Society of Saint-Sulpice, Dauversière formed the idea of establishing at the colony of Fort Ville-Marie in New France several communities: one of priests to convert the Indians, one of Religious Sisters to nurse the sick, and another to teach the local children of the Native Americans. Olier involved some of his wealthy penitents, while Royer found support from the Baron de Fanchamp, also a native of La Flèche. Others joined in, one being Angélique Bullion, and six persons formed The Company of Montreal (). They raised between them 75,000 livres.1642 The Founding Of Montreal The Company of Montreal was founded in Paris in 1639, notably by Dauversiere, with his friend the Baron de Fancamp and the Abbé Olier. These three were men who had become part of the movement for \\"montreal\\" and who, as a result of a near mystical vision shared nearly identically but independently by Royer and Olier, had bought the rights to the Island. Chausseau relinquished his seigneural rights in 1639 to the Intendant of the Association, Jean de Lauson, who, in turn, signed it over to Royer on 7 August 1640.Desautels, E. Jay. \\"Pierre Desautels and His Montreal\\", Sussex-Lisbon Area Historical Society, Inc. The society sponsored Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance, a lay woman, to go to Ville Marie with French colonists to evangelize the Native Americans, and establish a hospital, which became the Hôtel-Dieu de Montréal, to care for the poor, founded by Mance in 1642. In 1657 Mance returned to France, where she recruited three Hospitallers from a community of Hospitallers in Laval founded in 1650, Judith Moreau de Brésoles, Catherine Mace and Marie Maillet, to work at the hospital she had established. They set sail from La Rochelle for Ville-Marie on 2 July 1659. Dauversière boarded the boat before its departure to bless his spiritual daughters. A fellow traveler on that boat was Marguerite Bourgeoys, who was to play a major role in the future of the colony, founding the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal. The Hospitaller Sisters received letters patent from King Louis XIV of France authorizing them to take over the hospital and its operations two years after their arrival. Place de la Dauversière is a space for rest and relaxation that opened in Montreal in 1997. Death and veneration Dauversière took ill when he arrived home from La Rochelle where he had traveled to see the fulfillment of his vision. He spent four months suffering increasing debilitation, until his death on 6 November of that same year. His cause for canonization was eventually begun. On 6 July 2007, he was declared Venerable by Pope Benedict XVI.

It roosts in deciduous and evergreen forest, and is usually found near small bodies of water. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a subspecies of Greenhall's dog-faced bat (Cynomops greenhalli) in 1967 by Jones and Genoways. At the time, Greenhall's dog-faced bat was in the genus Molossops, so the Mexican dog-faced bat initially had the trinomen Molossops greenhalli mexicanus. When Cynomops was recognized as a valid genus rather than a subgenus of Molossops, Greenhall's dog-faced bat became part of the new genus. However, it wasn't until 2002 that the Mexican dog-faced bat was promoted to full species status. It is the most basal member of Cynomops. Its species name \\"mexicanus\\" is Latin meaning \\"from Mexico.\\" Description It is a relatively large free-tailed bat. Total length is ; forearms and tails are and long, respectively. It weighs .

In 1988, Rockford was ported back to the Atari ST, Amiga, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit family, and IBM PC compatibles. Plot The player is on a treasure hunt, and visits five worlds to collect treasures without getting crushed by giant rocks, boxing himself in, getting caught by enemies or running out of time. Once the required amount of treasure is collected, the player must locate the exit door to finish the level. The Explorer Gold coins must be collected. Enemies here are bats and evil monkeys.

The player must collect the designated amount of treasure items before he could leave the area and proceed to the next level. Every world features 4 levels, making it 20 levels altogether. The player dies if a stone or a treasure item falls onto him, collides or touches an enemy (even brushing against is enough for the kill), or runs out of time. The player must also watch out not to get himself or the exit locked. The player can kill enemies to break through walls and to obtain the desired amount of treasures. There are several special characters and contraptions to assist the player, such as faucets, clocks, plasma walls and worm-like creatures. This game has two distinct versions - one version offers unlimited lives, whereas the other gives 4 lives to the player upon starting a world, and an extra life is awarded after every 20000 points. Points are earned by collecting treasure items and racing the clock. Reception The game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #141 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.

The approved human gene nomenclature for the family is FXYD-domain containing ion transport regulator. It contains at least seven members in mammals. Two other family members that are not obvious orthologs of any identified mammalian FXYD protein exist in zebrafish. All these proteins share a signature sequence of six conserved amino acids comprising the FXYD motif in the NH2-terminus, and two glycines and one serine residue in the transmembrane domain. FXYD proteins are widely distributed in mammalian tissues with prominent expression in tissues that perform fluid and solute transport or that are electrically excitable. Initial functional characterization suggested that FXYD proteins act as channels or as modulators of ion channels. However, studies have revealed that most FXYD proteins have another specific function and act as tissue-specific regulatory subunits of the Na,K-ATPase. Each of these auxiliary subunits produces a distinct functional effect on the transport characteristics of the Na,K-ATPase that is adjusted to the specific functional demands of the tissue in which the FXYD protein is expressed. FXYD proteins appear to preferentially associate with Na,K-ATPase alpha1-beta isozymes, and affect their function in a way that render them operationally complementary or supplementary to coexisting isozymes.

Plot A girl named Alice is stuck while solving a difficult crossword puzzle when her cat Julius tells her they should go to the beach. They swim in the ocean for a while then dry off and Alice continues her puzzle. Just as she begins, Pete (a collector of rare crossword puzzles who discovers that it is the one he is missing) demands she give him her puzzle. Alice refuses and smacks him in the face. She then runs into a lighthouse and locks the door. Pete breaks down the door and chases Alice around the lighthouse. Alice screams for help and Julius hears her.

Alice then discovers the last phrase in her puzzle, \\"The End.\\"  Cast  *Margie Gay - Alice *Walt Disney - Julius, Bootleg Pete, Police Dog (voices) Legacy = Pete  Alice Solves the Puzzle was the first film to feature the antagonist Pete. He would go on to become the longest running character of all the Disney animated creations. In this first installment he is referred to as “Bootleg Pete” because of his use of whiskey (at a time when alcohol was illegal). Because of his peg used for a right leg, he quickly gained the nickname Peg-Leg Pete. The early Pete was portrayed as a bear, which he would stay for most of his early appearances until the advent of Mickey Mouse, and subsequently became a large cat.  Censorship  When Russell Merritt examined a German print of Alice Solves the Puzzle, he was surprised to find an additional scene missing from American prints. In most prints of Pete's first scene, he is shown speeding in a boat being pulled by a pelican. He passes a police-dog, who blows a whistle and chases him. Pete simply turns and laughs. However, Merrit discovered in the German version Pete is stopped by a customs inspector who examines the boat, then lets him pass. Pete then opens the pelican's mouth and pulls out a bottle of bootleg whiskey. This scene was cut because the Pennsylvania Censorship Board asked Disney to cut the scene during its first release. Disney then directed Winkler Studios, his distributor, to cut the scene from any further U.S. releases. The only remnant of the scene in the United States is two frames in which Pete's whiskey bottle is still visible.

He is an alumnus of the Literary Arts MFA program and Special Graduate Study PhD program at Brown University. In addition to his research in digital media, computer games, and software studies, he served for 10 years as a member of the Board of Directors of the Electronic Literature Organization. Career Wardrip-Fruin's twinned research track -- arts and humanities on the one hand and computer science on the other—is reflected in the table of the contents of The New Media Reader, which he co-edited with Nick Montfort.Wardrip-Fruin, Noah, and Nick Montfort, eds. The New Media Reader. Cambridge: MIT Press, 2003. He has also co-edited a series of new media textbooks and anthologies with Pat Harrigan: First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game (2004) as well as Second Person: Role-Playing and Story in Games and Playable Media (2007), Third Person: Authoring and Exploring Vast Narratives (2009), and Expressive Processing (2009), all of which have been influential in the development of new media studies. His collaborative works of electronic literature in installation form include Talking Cure (with Camille Utterback, Clilly Castiglia, and Nathan Wardrip- Fruin; 2002), which includes live video processing, speech recognition, and a dynamically composed sound environment and Screen (with Sascha Becker, Josh Carroll, Robert Coover, Shawn Greenlee, and Andrew McClain; 2003), which was created in the Cave at Brown University. He has also collaborated on what he calls \\"two textual instruments\\": News Reader and Regime Change (with David Durand, Brion Moss, and Elaine Froehlich). He also created Gray Matters with Michael Crumpton, Chris Spain and Kristin Allio (1995–97). His single-authored book, Expressive Processing, was published by MIT Press in 2009. In it, as Doug Reside describes, Wardrip-Fruin “makes a compelling case that software studies as a field is not only an interesting avenue of research for new media specialists but also should increasingly be a basic activity of educated citizens in a 21st century democracy.” Screen (2003) Wardrip-Fruin's interactive media art piece Screen is an example of digital installation art. To view and interact with the piece, a user first enters a room, called the \\"Cave,\\" which is a virtual reality display area with four walls surrounding the participant. White memory texts appear on the background of black walls. Through bodily interaction, such as using one's hand, a user can move and bounce the text around the walls. The words can be made into sentences and eventually begin to \\"peel\\" off and move more rapidly around the user, creating a heightening sense of misplacement. \\"In addition to creating a new form of bodily interaction with text through its play, Screen moves the player through three reading experiences — beginning with the familiar, stable, page-like text on the walls, followed by the word-by-word reading of peeling and hitting (where attention is focused), and with more peripheral awareness of the arrangements of flocking words and the new (often neologistic) text being assembled on the walls. Screen was first shown in 2003 as part of the Boston Cyberarts Festival (in the Cave at Brown University) and documentation of it has since been featured at The Iowa Review Web, presented at SIGGRAPH 2003, included in Alt+Ctrl: a festival of independent and alternative games, published in the DVD magazines Aspect and Chaise, as well as in readings in the Hammer Museum's HyperText series, at ACM Hypertext 2004, and in other venues.\\" See also *Game studies *Interactive storytelling *List of electronic literature authors, critics, and works *New Media Art *New media studies *New Media *Software studies ReferencesExternal links * Personal website * Expressive Intelligence Studio Blog at UC Santa Cruz * Article on Noah's new book Expressive Processing: Digital Fictions, Computer Games, and Software Studies * Reviews of The New Media Reader * \\"Talk Time\\" (Interview with Hamish Mackintosh for The Guardian (June 5, 2003)) * Uncharted 2’s Sloppy Fiction Category:American literary critics Category:American artists Category:American mass media scholars Category:Mass media theorists Category:Living people Category:MUD scholars Category:University of California, Santa Cruz faculty Category:Game researchers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Noah Wardrip-Fruin"},{"id":"24555557","text":"Dive Bomber (known as Night Raider in Europe) is a video game developed by Acme Animation in 1988 for the Commodore 64.

Morgan in London, and with Anton Schlieber in Vienna.Biographical Dictionary of the Organ He toured as a pianist and theatre conductor, and in 1919 joined the Trinity College of Music as a teacher, where he remained on staff as a teacher until a year before his death.Biblioz.com His students included William Lovelock and Nicholas Temperley. He also became music editor for the Edwin Ashdown and Enoch publishing firm. In later life he lived at Coleshill, near Beaconsfield, Bucks, where he gave private lessons in piano, violin, and composition. Henry Geehl had an affinity with music written for brass bands. He arranged Gustav Holst's A Moorside Suite for brass band, made many other arrangements and transcriptions, and was the first composer to write serious symphonic music directly for brass band. His Scena Sinfonica, in the style of an operatic selection, has been used as a test piece for brass bands.Roy Newsome, The Modern Brass Band: From the 1930s to the new millennium He made claims to have scored Edward Elgar's The Severn Suite for brass band from the composer's rough sketches, but Geehl's account of his involvement with Elgar has now been exposedSee Kay : \\"The Severn Suite — Manuscripts, Music and Myths\\" in the Elgar Society Journal for December 2013. as a self-serving fantasy.Trevor Herbert, The British Brass Band: A Musical and Social HistoryOfficial Journal of the North American Brass Band Association, Inc, August 1994 His other works include a symphony, concertos for piano and violin, Suite espagnole, Comedy Overture, In Fairyland, On the Cornish Coast, Rhapsody for band, Prince Charlie – 1745, piano pieces and songs.

Her best friend, Linda Luna \\"Gordilinda\\", also has achieved to win a scholarship at Bravo and will now be attending the school to fulfil her dream of becoming a ballerina. Finally, Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Ruiz and Reinaldo \\"Rey\\" Galán, each girl's respective boyfriend, will follow them a couple of days later and become students of Bravo themselves, the first to become a guitarist and the later to be an actor. But even being together they'll find out that not everything is so fine when Catalina Bernabeu, an evil girl who pretends to be sweet, starts scheming along her sidekick, Jessica \\"Jess\\" Chen, to ruin Isa's career, win Alex' affections and get Linda expelled; while Sebastian Lorenzo \\"Sebas\\" tries to win Isa's heart by any means.

By this time, she is very famous and has many fans. Because of this, her record studio sends her to the \\"Colegio Bravo\\", where she'll complete her studies in an attempt to fulfill her dreams alongside her boyfriend Alex. * Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Ruiz: Isa's boyfriend,who is really in love with her and whose best friend this time will be a boy nicknamed \\"Kike\\". Music is his favorite activity,and he's very happy and concerned for others. Sebastian will be his rival because of his continuous attempts to seduce Isa, and he'll also discover that Catalina Bernabeu has strong feelings for him. * Linda \\"Gordilinda\\" Luna: She is a very sensitive, funny, charismatic and loyal friend. She and Isa are best friends and also she is considered by many to be very pretty. It turns out that she will become a ballerina. She entered the same academy on a scholarship for her dancing skills. Unfortunately, the scholarship does not cover the entire cost of their stay, so this will force her to work part-time in the computer room. She's Rey's girlfriend at the start of the story. However, a student named Javier will show some interest in her, so she'll have numerous dilemmas and confusions throughout her studying career. * Reinaldo \\"Rey\\" Galán: His attitude has not changed at all through the course of time, and remains somewhat conceited. He enters into the academy because his grandmother gave him the money. He will be devoted to acting. He's Linda's boyfriend when arriving at the academy, but he'll meet a pretty girl named Sandra Centeno, who will make him think about whether his relationship with Linda is really worth it after all, so his relationship with Linda may be at risk. * Catalina \\"Cataclismica\\" Bernabeu: She pretends to be a sympathetic, tender and sweet girl, but she is a misleading, mysterious and malignant antagonist who tricks Isa throughout the story without notice. Her antagonistic goals seem to come from her dream of becoming a famous singer. Her voice is not considered to be perfect, making her live in the shadows of stronger celebrities such as Isa. She has many nicknames, commonly being a portmanteau of her name and a word that denotes catastrophe. * Sebastián \\"Sebas\\" Lorenzo: One of the most popular boys of the Bravo school. His father is a powerful music producer who always seems to get his in trouble. He'll be Alex's rival and Rey's bedroom partner. He falls in love with Isa shortly after her arrival. * Cristina \\"Cristarantula\\" Ricalde: Principal Violeta's niece and main antagonist of the previous series. Cristina is a manipulative and bratty daddy's girl, that grew used to always get her way. After living a mid-class life for some time after her father went bankrupt, Cristina became a top model and once again had a great fortune. She applies for a place at Colegio Bravo, so as to come back and try to ruin Isa's life. Her nickname is a portmanteau of her name and Tarantula. * Violeta Marindo \\"La Tamarindo\\": Executive Principal of Colegio Bravo. She's an arrogant and sour woman that dislikes joyfulness and creativity, thus dislikes Isa, her friends and many other Bravo students. She carries a bottle of homemade perfume and constantly sprays it on, much to everyone's annoyance. She also commonly misspells other people's last names, for example calling Isa \\"Pastrami\\" instead of Pasquali. Her nickname is a pun on how the last syllable of her name and her last name spell \\"Tamarindo\\", tamarind * Enrique \\"Kike\\" Toro: He's Alex' roommate and new best friend. He's a nerdy, but funny boy that is always over-analyzing everything. He also has some strange customs and manias. * Natalia \\"Naty\\" Tarazona: Naty is Isa's roommate and a gifted keyboardist. Though she's nice and pretty, she can be quite obsessive, specially to things regarding to Sebas, who is not only one of her best friends but also her love interest. She will compete with Fabi for Sebas' heart. * Jessica Chen \\"Jess\\": She's Catalina's roommate, sidekick and, presumably, best friend. Jess' business is gossip, she knows the secrets of everyone at Bravo and even has a webpage in which she publishes the juiciest news. She often does Catalina's dirty work loyally, even if it means that she'll get in trouble herself. * Javier \\"Javi\\" Mooner: One of Alex' new friends and rival of Rey. Javi is a hyperactive but charming boy that can't seem to stay still and is always dancing around the halls of the school. He feels heavily attracted to Linda, and although he isn't a bad person, he exploits Rey's flaws to get him and Linda to break up. * Sandra \\"Sandijuela\\" Centeno: Rey's acting classmate and friend. Sandi is a cute and clumsy girl that has a thing for strange fashion and is commonly seen wearing colorful wigs and accessories. Even though she feels attracted to Rey since the very moment they meet, she respects that he has a girlfriend and decides to stay a helpful friend to him, hoping that he'll fall in love with her. Her nickname is a pun on \\"Sanguijuela\\", Spanish for leech. * Fabiana \\"Fabi\\" Medina: One of Isa's roommates and friend of Sebas. Fabi is beautiful, but lacks any specific talent and sometimes can come across childish or even rude. Like Naty, Fabi is in love with Sebas, and so uses her lack of talent to get Sebas to spend time with her. * Agata \\"Monteblack\\" Montenegro: Agata is Violeta's chum and hall monitor for the girls dormitory. Even though she comes out straight as a serious person, she's actually simplistic and sweet girl. Agata has been trained by Violeta since she was a freshman to become her successor and she was always determined to do so. However, her newly made friendships and relationship with Kike make her doubt about this. Her nickname is based on how \\"Negro\\" means black. * Alvaro Lorenzo: Sebas' father and owner of a powerful label. Alvaro is a shady man that cares little for anybody that isn't himself. He wants Sebas to approach Isa so he can get her to sign with his label and abandon Zafiro. * Andy Roca: Creative Principal of Colegio Bravo. He's a good, somewhat strict man that cares deeply for the well-being and development of his students. Andy constantly clashes with Violeta, and often foils her plans to get rid of Isa and her friends. * Abelardo Flores: The school's janitor and handyman, also a good friend to Isa and Alex. Abelardo lives with his family in the school and sometimes helps the students with their problems.

The biogenesis of fimbriae (or pili) requires a two- component assembly and transport system which is composed of a periplasmic chaperone and an outer membrane protein which has been termed a molecular 'usher'. The usher protein has a molecular weight ranging from 86 to 100 kDa and is composed of a membrane-spanning 24-stranded beta barrel domain, reminiscent of porins, and of four periplasmic soluble domains: an N-terminal one of about 120 residues (NTD), a 'middle' domain of about 80 residues located as a soluble insertion within the beta barrel region of the sequence (plug domain) and two IG-like domains (each about 80 residues long) at the C-terminus (CTD1 and CTD2). Although the degree of sequence similarity of these proteins is not very high they share a number of characteristics. One of these is the presence of two pairs of disulfide bond-forming cysteines, the first one located in the NTD and the second in CTD2.

In 1948 the company was renamed VEB Fahrzeugwerk Waltershausen, a name it retained until its privatization in 1991. In 1956 production began on the DK 3 diesel cart (also known as the Diesel Ant, ants being hard-working). This had been developed in the Ludwigsfelde works and was actually an Electrocar with a diesel engine. Two years later, the first Multicar, the M21, was produced. By 1964, 14,000 units had left the factory in Waltershausen. For the following ten years the M22 mini truck left the production line, with 42,500 vehicles built. Until 1978, its successor, the M24, was produced with 25,600 vehicles leaving the factory, 48% of which were exported. The M25 was a major export; 70% went to the Comecon states and the West. The M25 had an IFA-built diesel engine with . Its production was continued in 1991 with the Modell 91, which had a VW engine. Approximately 100,000 units were produced. In 1991, the state-owned factory was privatized, becoming Hako-Werke GmbH (Hako Works, Hako being short for Hans Koch & Son). The crucial driving force behind the turnaround - and after reunification - was the former director of materials management at Multicar, Manfred Windus, who was honored in 1993 as manager of the year. From 1993 to 2009, the M26 was produced. In 1998 Hako-Werke bought the shares held by Deutsche Beteiligungsgesellschaft (an equity fund) and thus became the majority shareholder. The products TREMO and UX100 were moved to Waltershausen. In 2001 production began on a new series, FUMO (short for FUnction and MObility). Since 2004, in cooperation with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, the Specialty Vehicle Mungo has been produced for use in the Bundeswehr. The manager Walter Botschatzki was awarded the Order of Merit First Class in 2005 by the German Federal President Horst Köhler. The current products M27, FUMO and the particularly narrow TREMO Carrier are equipped with engines that meet all of the Euro-5 emission standards. Currently, seven vehicles are produced a day.

Other * Chorus * Dance * Art * Flagler Auditorium * Theatre Program  2010 theater controversy  Flagler Palm Coast High School garnered national attention when Principal Jacob Oliva canceled the school's theatrical production of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" due to concerns over the community's possible reaction to racial slurs used in the script. Though the book is standard reading for high school students, Oliva said that classroom readings have the benefit of teacher guidance, whereas for the community \\"any time we open our doors to the community, we don't know who is going to come in and how they're going to react to whatever material they see.\\" The Dramatists Guild of America and the National Coalition Against Censorship issued a joint letter in protest of the decision, arguing that \\"Whereas going ahead with the production would have created a teachable moment by asking how art can deal with the darker sides of history, now the issue is whether we need censorship to 'protect' the community from the painful truths of history.\\" After widespread criticism from students, staff, and the community, the school board ultimately voted to allow the play to be rescheduled for a later date.School board votes in favor of ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ play at Flagler Palm Coast High School  Bulldog Learning Commons  What was known as the Flagler Palm Coast High School Media Center since last year (2016-2017) has changed to the Bulldog Learning Commons. Last school year, teachers, staff, and students worked together toward this transformation. The Bulldog Learning Commons provides space with technology and allows students to work with their peers. It supplies high school students with books and a quiet place to read. There are also “break out” rooms that used to be empty storage rooms. Now these four rooms are meeting rooms, studio recording rooms, and a technology help desk. The Bulldog Learning Commons now has Cafe F.A.M.E, located at the front entrance of the learning commons. It is open for students to have breakfast there every morning. Behind the Cafe there are six collaborative workstations that provide large television screens that are installed with tidebreak and air servers. These tvs allow students to connect their Macbooks, iPads, or personal cell phones to present on the screen in order to work in groups. There are teacher work days that allow teachers to go in and have their students work in groups. They also have people come in and present to about organizations and jobs that would be useful to them. Some study groups sit down and Skype with students from Israel to discuss disappearing languages in their country. A few times a year military recruiters come by and set up booths to talk to anyone who would like to know more about serving in the military. Two librarians are available daily to facilitate and guide students.

Her work has appeared at the Whitney Biennial (2004), and at major film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival, the São Paulo International Film Festival, the Palm Springs International Film Festival and the Hamptons International Film Festival. Her stories are often described as \\"quirky\\", with themes of love, isolation, and the delicate nature of relationships between young women commonly recurring. Her signature visual style often incorporates found or pre-existing media with rich, original material to create a unique, heavily stylized narrative result. Her current project, \\"The Promised Band,\\" is a feature-length documentary about a group of women in Israel and Palestine who start a fake band as a way to explore their taboo friendships. The band is a metaphor for the greater society, with each character playing an archetypal role. The band struggles and fails for the same reasons the society itself struggles and fails, and when the women are able to achieve a modest triumph, the film posits that women in warring societies may be the key to peace. \\"The Promised Band\\" premiered at the Cinequest Film Festival in March 2016 and took home both the Award for Best Documentary and the Canon Filmmaker Award. Ms. Heck's work has garnered a number of other awards and nominations as well, including honors from New York Women in Film and Television, the Iris Prize, Zurich's Pink Apple, the Short Movie Awards,https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/PlanetOut_Short_Movie_Awards/2007 the Provincetown International Film Festival,https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Provincetown_International_Film_Festival/2007 the Big Muddy Film Festival, and Newfest.

She worked in front of the camera in her early teens, and was featured in national TV commercials before moving permanently behind the scenes in the early 2000s. In 1998 she was the subject of an episode of the Travel Channel's American Journey series. Heck is an avid cyclist and American Journey followed her as she embarked on the Boston-New York AIDSRide, a yearly charitable event for cyclists. She is a graduate of two prestigious film programs, New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, and Columbia University School of the Arts. Collaborations and Affiliations Most recently, Heck collaborated with Van Jones and members of musician Prince's family to create a short piece about Prince's secret philanthropic work. The piece featured President Barack Obama, Janelle Monáe, Black Lives Matter co- founder Alicia Garza, and others. Beginning in 2000, Heck performed as a turntablist and DJ with well-known MCs Cazwell and Crasta Yo for almost two years before leaving their band, Morplay, to pursue film exclusively. That same year she created the 60 Second Film Festival, the first fully online film festival, a groundbreaking event at that time. In 2001, Heck co-founded Brooklyn-based Charged Animation with filmmakers Scott Rosann, Tunde Adebimpe, Alex Cohn, and Adam Pierce. In 2004 Heck worked with fine artist Eve Sussman to produce 89 Seconds at Alcazar, a live-action piece based on the 1656 Diego Velázquez painting Las Meninas. Alcazar was an official selection of the 2004 Whitney Biennial and was subsequently purchased by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. She has also worked with fine artist Mark Tribe on his ongoing Port Huron Project. In 2006, Heck collaborated with fellow Columbia University film student Madeleine Olnek to write Hold Up, an award- winning short film that was featured at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. The film also received the Audience Award for favorite short film at Newfest. Heck has worked with Oscar-nominated Director of Photography Martina Radwan on her films Airplanes, Salamander, and The Promised Band. As a director- cinematographer team, the pair receives generous and ongoing support from Panavision and Canon. In 2008, she served briefly as an adjunct professor of film at Manhattanville College. She is currently developing a feature-length version of her award-winning short film \\"Salamander.\\" Partial filmography * The Promised Band, 2016, feature documentary  Winner, Best Documentary Feature, Cinequest Film Festival * Salamander, 2009, short  Winner, Audience Award, Columbia University Film Festival; Nominated for Iris Prize, Cardiff * Airplanes, 2007, short  Winner, Best Short Film at Provincetown International Film Festival, The Big Movie Awards, & Zurich Pink Apple * Hold Up, 2006, short (writer)  Official Selection, Sundance Film Festival; Winner, Best Short Film, Newfest * The Last Days of Leni Riefenstahl, 2005, short  Winner, Best Short Film, The Big Muddy Film Festival * 89 Seconds at Alcazar, 2004  Official Selection, 2004 Whitney Biennial ReferencesExternal links  Jen Heck on Vimeo * Airplanes at Seattle International Film Festival Category:1978 births Category:American cinematographers Category:American film producers Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:American women cinematographers Category:American women film directors Category:Living people Category:Writers from Worcester, Massachusetts Category:Tisch School of the Arts alumni Category:American women screenwriters Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Businesspeople from Worcester, Massachusetts Category:Film directors from Massachusetts Category:American women film producers Category:Screenwriters from Massachusetts ","title":"Jen Heck"},{"id":"24556068","text":"The Greater Allen Cathedral of New York is an African Methodist Episcopal church located in Jamaica, Queens, New York.Cathedral of Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church (in Queens County, NY) The congregation currently has over 23,000 members, making it one of the largest churches in the United States.http://www.allencathedral.org/allen/history.htmM The church's budget exceeds $34 million annually and it operates a 750-student private school, as well as numerous commercial and social service enterprises.http://www.secure- allencathedral.org/allen/Floyd_Flake.htm It also holds a number of expansive commercial and residential properties and coordinates a number of subsidiary organizations.

History  Yajnavalkya Smriti, a historic Indian text on statecraft and jurisprudence, suggested to have been written before the 5th century AD, prohibited the cutting of trees and prescribed punishment for such acts. During Chandragupta's reign, there was a regular forest department led by a Kupyadhyaksha (superintendent) and Vanpalas (forest guards). Kautilya's Arthashastra says that they had a role of classifying the trees, plants and herbs and fixing their price; they imposed fines on those who fell trees without permission. It further mentions how forests were classified into three types: Reserved, those donated to Brahmins and public. Written in Mauryan period, it emphasised the need for forest administration. Ashoka went further, and his Pillar Edicts expressed his view about the welfare of environment and biodiversity. Protected areas As of May 2004, the protected areas of India cover 156,700 km², roughly 4.95% of the total surface area. These areas are used for in situ conservation, which involves conservation of species in their natural habitat. Water Conservation From the most dry regions to the wettest zones in the world, India has them all. Water is not just a natural resource but a political issue in most parts of the country. The Cauvery dispute between Karnataka-Tamil Nadu, Mahanadi dispute between Chhattisgarh- Orissa are a few examples of the tussle for water.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/explained-what-cauvery-water- dispute-between-karnataka-and-tn-all-about-76528 The Tamil Nadu government's rainwater harvesting efforts http://www.tn.gov.in/dtp/rainwater.htm civil society movements such as Environmentalist Foundation of India (E.F.I's) community based lake/pond conservation efforts are seen as efforts to conserve water in India.https://www.thebetterindia.com/99349/environmentalist- foundation-of-india-fundraiser/ Endangered species The Bengal tiger, primarily found in India and Bangladesh, is an endangered species. Some endangered species in the country were reintroduced via ex situ conservation. Ex-situ conservation is rearing or cultivating, including reintroducing, a plant or animal outside their natural habitat. The reintroduction of the Indian rhinoceros at the Dudhwa National Park was a form of ex-situ conservation; it was extinct in that area. Similarly the Gangetic gharial was reintroduced in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Western part of the Indian peninsula is one of the 32 ecological hotspots of the world. Ecological issues are an integral and important part of environmental issues challenging India. Poor air quality, water pollution and garbage pollution – all affect the food and environment quality necessary for ecosystems. India is a large and diverse country. Its land area includes regions with some of the world's highest rainfall to very dry deserts, coast line to alpine regions, river deltas to tropical islands. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation is large. India is one of the 12 mega regions of the world. Indian forests types include tropical evergreens, tropical deciduous, swamps, mangroves, sub-tropical, montane, scrub, sub-alpine and alpine forests. These forests support a variety of ecosystems with diverse flora and fauna. Until recently, India lacked an objective way to determine the quantity of forests it had, and the quality of forests it had. ; Forest cover measurement methods Prior to the 1980s, India deployed a bureaucratic method to estimate forest coverage. A land was notified as covered under Indian Forest Act, and then officials deemed this land area as recorded forest even if it was devoid of vegetation. By this forest-in-name-only method, the total amount of recorded forest, per official Indian records, was . Any comparison of forest coverage number of a year before 1987 for India, to current forest coverage in India, is thus meaningless; it is just bureaucratic record keeping, with no relation to reality or meaningful comparison. In the 1980s, space satellites were deployed for remote sensing of real forest cover. Standards were introduced to classify India's forests into the following categories: * Forest Cover: defined as all lands, more than one hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent. (Such lands may or may not be statutorily notified as forest area). ** Very Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 70 percent and above ** Moderately Dense Forest: All lands, with a forest cover with canopy density of 40–70 percent ** Open Forest: All lands, with forest cover with canopy density of ten to forty percent ** Mangrove Cover: Mangrove forest is salt tolerant forest ecosystem found mainly in tropical and sub-tropical coastal and/or inter-tidal regions. Mangrove cover is the area covered under mangrove vegetation as interpreted digitally from remote sensing data. It is a part of forest cover and also classified into three classes viz. very dense, moderately dense and open. ** Non Forest Land: defined as lands without any forest cover * Scrub Cover: All lands, generally in and around forest areas, having bushes and or poor tree growth, chiefly small or stunted trees with canopy density less than 10 percent * Tree Cover: Land with tree patches (blocks and linear) outside the recorded forest area exclusive of forest cover and less than the minimum mapable area of one hectare * Trees Outside Forests: Trees growing outside Recorded Forest Areas The first satellite recorded forest coverage data for India became available in 1987. India and the United States cooperated in 2001, using Landsat MSS with spatial resolution of 80 metres, to get accurate Indian forest distribution data. India thereafter switched to digital image and advanced satellites with 23 metres resolution and software processing of images to get more refined data on forest quantity and forest quality. India now assesses its forest distribution data biennially. The 2007 forest census data thus obtained and published by the Government of India suggests the five states with largest area under forest cover as the following: * Madhya Pradesh: 7.64 million hectares * Arunachal Pradesh: 6.8 million hectares * Chhattisgarh: 5.6 million hectares * Orissa: 4.83 million hectares * Maharashtra: 4.68 million hectares India hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.Indira Gandhi Conservation Monitoring Centre (IGCMC), New Delhi and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Cambridge, UK. 2001. Biodiversity profile for India . In recent decades, human encroachment has posed a threat to India's wildlife; in response, a system of national parks and protected areas, first established in 1935, was substantially expanded. In 1972, India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial habitat; further federal protections were promulgated in the 1980s. Along with over 500 wildlife sanctuaries, India now hosts 18 biosphere reserves, eleven of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves; 27 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention. These laws did not have the effect they intended. In 1985, India created the Ministry of Environment and Forests. This was followed by a National Forest Policy and the major government reforms of the early 1990s. Over the last 20 years, India has reversed the deforestation trend. Specialists of the United Nations report India's forest as well as woodland cover has increased. A 2010 study by the Food and Agriculture Organisation ranks India amongst the 10 countries with the largest forest area coverage in the world (the other nine being Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, United States of America, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Australia, Indonesia and Sudan). India is also one of the top 10 countries with the largest primary forest coverage in the world, according to this study. From 1990 to 2000, FAO finds India was the fifth largest gainer in forest coverage in the world; whilst from 2000 to 2010, FAO considers India as the third largest gainer in forest coverage. ; National Forest Commission and India's afforestation programme In 2003, India set up a National Forest Commission to review and assess India's policy and law, its effect on India's forests, its impact of local forest communities, and to make recommendations to achieve sustainable forest and ecological security in India. The report made over 300 recommendations including the following: * India must pursue rural development and animal husbandry policies to address local communities need to find affordable cattle fodder and grazing. To avoid destruction of local forest cover, fodder must reach these communities on reliable roads and other infrastructure, in all seasons year round. * The Forest Rights Bill is likely to be harmful to forest conservation and ecological security. The Forest Rights Bill became a law since 2007. * The government should work closely with mining companies. Revenue generated from lease of mines must be pooled into a dedicated fund to conserve and improve the quality of forests in the region where the mines are located. * Power to declare ecologically sensitive areas must be with each Indian state. * The mandate of State Forest Corporations and government owned monopolies must be changed. * Government should reform regulations and laws that ban felling of trees and transit of wood within India. Sustainable agro-forestry and farm forestry must be encouraged through financial and regulatory reforms, particularly on privately owned lands. India's national forest policy expects to invest US$26.7 billion by 2020, to pursue nationwide afforestation coupled with forest conservation, with the goal of increasing India's forest cover from 20% to 33%.

It has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the Iberian lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle. It is known as an invasive species because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. Feral European rabbits in Australia have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there. The European rabbit is well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related hares (Lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist Ronald Lockley, who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in Orielton, Pembrokeshire. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book The Private Life of the Rabbit, which is credited by Richard Adams as having played a key role in his gaining \\"a knowledge of rabbits and their ways\\" that informed his novel Watership Down. The other group was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood. Naming and etymology Because of its non-British origin, the species does not have native names in English or Celtic, with the usual terms \\"cony\\" and \\"rabbit\\" being foreign loanwords. \\"Rabbit\\" is also pronounced as rabbidge, rabbert (North Devon) and rappit (Cheshire and Lancashire). More archaic pronunciations include rabbette (15th-16th centuries), rabet (15th-17th centuries), rabbet (16th-18th centuries), rabatte (16th century), rabytt (17th century) and rabit (18th century). The root word is the Walloon rabett, which was once commonly used in Liège. Rabett itself is derived from the Middle Dutch robbe, with the addition of the suffix -ett. The term \\"cony\\" or \\"coney\\" predates \\"rabbit\\", and first occurred during the 13th century to refer to the animal's pelt. Later, \\"cony\\" referred to the adult animal, while \\"rabbit\\" referred to the young. The root of \\"cony\\" is the old French connil or counil, of which the Norman plural was coniz, and later conis. Its forerunner is the Greek κύνικλος, from which the Latin cuniculus is derived. The origin of κύνικλος itself is unclear: Ælian, who lived during the 3rd century, linked the word to Celtiberian and later authors relate it to its Basque name unchi; Varo and Pliny connected it to cuneus, which refers to a wedge, thus making reference to the animal's digging ability. The species' dwelling place is termed a warren or cony-garth. \\"Warren\\" comes from the Old English wareine, itself derived from the Old French warenne, varenne, or garenne. The root word is the Low Latin warenna, which originally signified a preserve in general, only to be later used to refer specifically to an enclosure set apart for rabbits and hares. \\"Cony-garth\\" derives from the Middle English conygerthe, which may be a compound of connynge+erthe (cony+earth). The term stems from the Old French conniniere or coninyere, and later conilliere. The root word is the Low Latin cunicularia, the feminine form of the adjective cunicularius, which pertains to the rabbit. Taxonomy Though originally assigned to the genus Lepus, the European rabbit was consigned to its own genus in 1874, on account of its altricial young, burrowing habits, and numerous skeletal characters. The European rabbit is superficially similar to the North American cottontails, as both Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus are born blind and naked, have white flesh, and little sexual dimorphism. However, the two differ in skull characteristics, and cottontails do not habitually construct their own burrows as the European rabbit does. Molecular studies confirm that the resemblance between the two is due to convergent evolution, and that the European rabbit's closest relatives are the hispid hare, the riverine rabbit and the Amami rabbit. The oldest known fossils attributed to the modern European rabbit species are around 0.5 Ma old (Middle Pleistocene).Lopez-Martinez, Nieves (2008), The Lagomorph Fossil Record and the Origin of the European Rabbit, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2008, Print The cladogram is from Matthee et al., 2004, based on nuclear and mitochondrial gene analysis. Subspecies , six subspecies are recognised by MSW3.

The European rabbit is smaller than the European hare and mountain hare, and lacks black ear-tips, as well as having proportionately shorter legs. An adult European rabbit can measure in length, and weigh . The hind foot measures in length, while the ears are long from the occiput. Size and weight varies according to food and habitat quality, with rabbits living on light soil with nothing but grass to feed on being noticeably smaller than specimens living on highly cultivated farm-lands with plenty of roots and clover. Pure European rabbits weighing and upwards are uncommon, but are occasionally reported. One large specimen, caught in February 1890 in Lichfield, was weighed at . Unlike the brown hare, the male European rabbit is more heavily built than the female. The penis is short, and lacks a baculum and true glans. The fur of the European rabbit is generally greyish-brown, but this is subject to much variation. The guard hairs are banded brown and black, or grey, while the nape of the neck and scrotum are reddish. The chest patch is brown, while the rest of the underparts are white or grey. A white star shape is often present on kits' foreheads, but rarely occurs in adults. The whiskers are long and black, and the feet are fully furred and buff-coloured. The tail has a white underside, which becomes prominent when escaping danger. This may act as a signal for other rabbits to run. Moulting occurs once a year, beginning in March on the face and spreading over the back. The underfur is completely replaced by October–November. The European rabbit exhibits great variation in colour, from light sandy, to dark grey and completely black. Such variation depends largely on the amount of guard hairs relative to regular pelage. Melanists are not uncommon in mainland Europe, though albinoes are rare. Life history and behaviour G. E. Lodge. Entrances to a rabbit warren Social and territorial behaviours The European rabbit lives in warrens that contain 2-10 other individuals living in smaller groups to ensure greater breeding success.Daly, J. C. (1981). \\"Effects of Social Organization and Environmental Diversity on Determining the Genetic Structure of a Population of the Wild Rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus.\\" Evolution 35(4): 689-706. Territoriality and aggression contribute greatly to the rabbits' maturation process, and help ensure survival of the population.Dudzinski, M. L., R. Mykytowycz, et al. (1977). \\"Behavioral Characteristics of Adolescence in Young Captive European Rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus.\\" Aggressive Behavior 3: 313-330. Females tend to be more territorial than males, although the areas most frequented by females are not defended.Vastrade, F. M. (1987). \\"Spacing Behavior of Free-Ranging Domestic Rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus L.\\" Applied Animal Behaviour Science 18:185-195. Territories are marked with dung hills.Mykytowycz, R. and M. L. Dudzinski (1972). \\"Aggressive and Protective Behaviour of Adult Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus (L.) Towards Rabbits.\\" Behaviour 43: 97-120. The size of the species' home range varies according to habitat, food, shelter, cover from predators, and breeding sites, though it is generally small, encompassing about 0.3-0.7 hectares. Except during times of low rabbit density and abundance of high-quality food, male ranges tend to be larger than those held by females. The European rabbit rarely strays far from its burrow: when feeding on cultivated fields, it typically only moves 25 metres away from its burrow, and rarely 50 metres. It may however move as far as 500 metres after an abrupt change in environment, such as a harvest. This behaviour may be an anti-predator adaptation, as rabbits in areas where predators are under rigorous control may move three times further from their burrows than those in areas without predator management. The European rabbit is a gregarious animal, which lives in stable social groups centred around females sharing access to one or more burrow systems. However, social structures tend to be looser in areas where burrow construction is relatively easy. Dominance hierarchies exist in parallel for both bucks and does. Among bucks, status is determined through access to does, with dominant bucks siring the majority of the colony's offspring. The dominant does have priority access to the best nesting sites, with competition over such sites often leading to serious injury or death. Subordinate does, particularly in large colonies, typically resort to using single-entrance breeding spots far from the main warren, thus making themselves vulnerable to fox or badger predation. Reproduction and development In the European rabbit's mating system, dominant bucks exhibit polygyny, whereas lower-status individuals (both bucks and does) often form monogamous breeding relationships. Rabbits signal their readiness to copulate by marking other animals and inanimate objects with an odoriferous substance secreted though a chin gland, in a process known as \\"chinning\\".Gonzalez-Mariscal, G., M. E. Albonetti, et al. (1997). \\"Transitory inhibition of scent marking by copulation in male and female rabbits.\\" Animal Behavior 53:323-333. Though male European rabbits may sometimes be amicable with one another, fierce fights can erupt among bucks during the breeding season, typically January to August. A succession of litters (usually 3-7 kittens each) are produced, but in overpopulated areas, pregnant does may lose all their embryos through intrauterine resorption. Shortly before giving birth, the doe will construct a separate burrow known as a \\"stop\\" or \\"stab\\", generally in an open field away from the main warren. These breeding burrows are typically a few feet long and are lined with grass and moss as well as fur plucked from the doe's belly. The breeding burrow protects the kittens from adult bucks as well as from predators. The gestation period of the European rabbit is 30 days, with the sex ratio of male to female kittens tending to be 1:1. Greater maternal investment over male offspring may result in higher birth weights for bucks. Kittens born to the dominant buck and doe--who enjoy better nesting and feeding grounds--tend to grow larger and stronger and to become more dominant than kittens born to subordinate rabbits. It is not uncommon for European rabbits to mate again immediately after giving birth, with some specimens having been observed to nurse previous young whilst pregnant. Female European rabbits nurse their kittens once a night, for only a few minutes. After suckling is complete, the doe seals the entrance to the stop with soil and vegetation. In its native Iberian and southern French range, European rabbit kittens have a growth rate of per day, though such kittens in non-native ranges may grow per day. Weight at birth is and increases to by 21–25 days, during the weaning period. European rabbit kittens are born blind, deaf, and nearly naked. The ears do not gain the power of motion until 10 days of age, and can be erected after 13. The eyes open 11 days after birth. At 18 days, the kittens begin to leave the burrow. Sexual maturity in bucks is attained at four months, while does can begin to breed at three to five months. Burrowing behaviour The European rabbit's burrows occur mostly on slopes and banks, where drainage is more efficient. The burrow entrances are typically 10–50 cm in diameter, and are easily recognisable by the bare earth at their mouths. Vegetation growth is prevented by the constant passing and repassing of the resident rabbits. Big burrows are complex excavations which may descend to depths of several feet. They are not constructed on any specified plan, and appear to be enlarged or improved as a result of the promiscuous activity of several generations. Digging is done by pulling the soil backwards with the forefeet and throwing it between the hind legs, which scatter the material with kicking motions. While most burrows are dug from the outside, some warrens feature holes dug from the inside which act as emergency exits when escaping from predators below ground. These holes usually descend perpendicularly to 3–4 feet, and their mouths lack the bare earth characteristic of burrow entrances. While kittens sleep in chambers lined with grass and fur, adults sleep on the bare earth, likely in order to prevent damp, with warmth being secured by huddling. Although both sexes dig, does do so more skillfully, and for longer periods. Communication The European rabbit is usually a silent animal, though it has at least two vocalisations. The most well known is a high treble scream or squeal. This distress call has been likened to the cry of a piglet. This sound is uttered when in extreme distress, such as being caught by a predator or trap. During the spring, bucks express contentment by emitting grunting sounds when approaching other rabbits. These grunts are similar to shrill hiccups, and are emitted with the mouth closed. Aggression is expressed with a low growl. Ecology European rabbit attacked by a stoat, Northumberland, UK. European rabbit afflicted with myxomatosis. Habitat The European rabbit's ideal habitat consists of short grasslands with secure refuge (such as burrows, boulders, hedgerows, scrub and woodland) near feeding areas. It may dwell up to treeline, as long as the land is well drained and shelter is available. The size and distribution of its burrow systems depend on the type of soil present: in areas with loose soil, it selects sites with supporting structures, such as tree roots or shrubs in order to prevent burrow collapse. Warrens tend to be larger and have more interconnected tunnels in areas with chalk than those in sand. In large coniferous plantations, the species only occurs on peripheral areas and along fire breaks and rides. Diet The European rabbit eats a wide variety of herbage, especially grasses, favouring the young, succulent leaves and shoots of the most nutritious species, particularly fescues. In mixed cultivated areas, winter wheat is preferred over maize and dicotyledons. During the summer period, the European rabbit feeds on the shortest, and therefore less nutritious grass swards, thus indicating that grazing grounds are selected through anti-predator considerations rather than maximising food intake. In times of scarcity, the rabbit increases its food intake, selecting the parts of the plant with the highest nitrogen content. Hungry rabbits in winter may resort to eating tree bark. Blackberries are also eaten, and captive-bred European rabbits have been fed on fodder consisting of furze and acorns, which can lead to considerable weight gain. The European rabbit is a less fussy eater than the brown hare: when eating root vegetables, the rabbit eats them whole, while the hare tends to leave the peel. Depending on the body's fat and protein reserves, the species can survive without food in winter for about 2–8 days. Although herbivorous, cases are known of rabbits eating snails. Like other leporids, the European rabbit produces soft, mucus-covered faecal pellets, which are ingested directly from the anus. The soft pellets are produced posterior to the colon in the hind-gut soon after the excretion of hard pellets and the stomach begins to fill with newly-grazed food. The soft pellets are filled with protein-rich bacteria, and pass down to the rectum in glossy clusters. The rabbit swallows them whole, without perforating the enveloping membrane. Predators The European rabbit is prey to many different predatory species. Foxes, dingoes, wolves, lynxes, wolverines and dogs kill both adult and young rabbits by stalking and surprising them in the open. However, relatively few rabbits are caught this way, as rabbits can quickly rush back to cover with a burst of speed. Further, evidence from a study in Spain suggests they may avoid areas where the recent scat of predators which have eaten rabbit is detected. Both foxes and badgers will dig out kittens from shallow burrows, with the latter predators being too slow to catch adult rabbits. Both wild and domestic cats will stalk and leap upon rabbits, particularly young specimens leaving their burrows for the first time. Wildcats take rabbits according to availability: in eastern Scotland, where rabbits are abundant, they can comprise over 90% of the wildcats' diet. Most domestic cats are incapable of killing healthy, full-grown adults, but will take weak and diseased ones. Does can be fiercely protective of their kittens, having been observed to chase away large cats and mustelids, including ferrets, stoats and weasels. However, rabbits typically run from mustelids, and may fear them innately. Cases are known of rabbits becoming paralysed with fear and dying when pursued by stoats or weasels, even when rescued unharmed. It is known that the European rabbit comprises 85% of the polecat's diet, and its availability is important to the success of breeding female mink. Brown rats can be a serious threat to kittens, as they will reside in rabbit burrows during the summer, and attack them in groups. Although many birds of prey are capable of killing rabbits, few are strong enough to carry them. Large species, such as golden and sea eagles, may carry rabbits back to their nests, while small eagles, buzzards and harriers struggle to do so. Hawks and owls typically only carry off very small kittens. Diseases and parasites The European rabbit is the only species fatally attacked by myxomatosis. The most lethal strain has a five day incubation period, after which the eyelids swell, with the inflammation quickly spreading to the base of the ears, the forehead and nose. At the same time, the anal and genital area also swells. During the last stages of the disease, the swellings discharge a fluid rich in viral material, with death usually following on the 11th-12th day of infection. In Britain, the primary carrier of myxomatosis is the flea Spilopsyllus cuniculi, while in Australia it is mosquitoes. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as viral haemorragic disease (VHD) or rabbit calicivirus disease in Australia, is specific to the European rabbit, and causes lesions of acute necrotising hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and haemorraging, mainly in the lungs. Susceptible specimens may die within 30 hours of infection. Most rabbits in the UK are immune to RHD, due to exposure to a weaker strain. Human relationship with rabbits Two rabbits on the steps of Finnish National Opera. In Helsinki region freed pet rabbits are considered pests. Recent research has shown that all European rabbits carry common genetic markers and descend from one of two maternal lines. These lines originated between 12,000 and 6.5 million years ago when glaciers isolated two herds; one on the Iberian Peninsula and the other in Southern France. It can be surmised that humans began hunting rabbits as a food source, but further research needs to be done to verify this. Little comprehensive evidence of the relationship of humans with European rabbits is documented until the medieval period. Humans' relationship with the European rabbit was first recorded by the Phoenicians prior to 1000 BC, when they termed the Iberian Peninsula i-Shaphan-ím (literally, the land of the hyraxes). This phrase closely resembles related modern Hebrew: I (אי) meaning island and shafan (שפן) meaning hyrax, plural shfaním (שפנים). Phoenicians called the local rabbits 'hyraxes' because rabbits resemble hyraxes in some ways, and hyraxes are native to Phoenicia, unlike rabbits. Hyraxes, like rabbits, are not rodents. One theory states that the Romans converted the phrase i-Shaphan-ím, with influence from the Greek Spania, to its Latin form, Hispania, which evolved in all the Iberian languages: into Castilian España, Portuguese Espanha, Catalan Espanya (English \\"Spain\\"), and such other variations in modern languages. The precise meaning of shafan remains unclear, but the balance of opinion appears to indicate that the hyrax is indeed the intended meaning. Like the Phoenicians, neither the later Greek nor Roman colonizers had a specific name for the rabbit, because the species is not native to Greece and Italy (though it is present there nowadays). They commonly called it \\"small hare\\" and \\"small digging hare\\", in contrast to the European hare, which is larger and doesn't make burrows. Catullus used the name cuniculus (a latinization of the Iberian word kiniklos and the etymological origin of the Castilian name conejo, Portuguese coelho and Catalan conill,Corominas, Joan & José A. Pascual (1980) Diccionario crítico etimológico castellano e hispánico. Vol. 2, s.v. conejo. Madrid: Gredos. and the old English name, coney), and referenced its abundance in Celtiberia by calling this region cuniculosa, i.e. rabbit-ridden.López Seoane, V.

Manuel Mirás, 544 pages.Blázquez, J.M. (1975) La romanización. Ediciones Akal, 437 pages. The European rabbit is the only rabbit species that has been domesticated and all 305 global rabbit breeds-- from Netherland Dwarf to Flemish Giant-- are descendants of the European rabbit. Rabbits are an example of an animal that can be treated as a food, a pet, or a pest by different members of the same culture. In some urban areas, infestations of feral European rabbits (descended from pets) have become a problem. Helsinki, for example, host to one of the northernmost populations of the species, had an estimated 2,500 European rabbits at the end of 2006, doubling to 5,000 by autumn 2007. In Iceland, populations of O. cuniculus are found in urban Reykjavik as well as in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. In Finland, the introduced European rabbit vies with the native lagomorphs: the European hare and the mountain hare. As an introduced species Feral rabbits on the island of Ōkunoshima. A non-native species, rabbits were introduced to the island following World War II as part of the development of a park. The rabbits established a self-sustaining population on Ōkunoshima in the latter half of the 20th century. The European rabbit has been introduced as an exotic species into several environments, often with harmful results to vegetation and local wildlife, making it an invasive species. The first known mention of the rabbit as an invasive species (and possibly the first documented instance of an invasive species ever) was made in regard to the introduction of the rabbit to the Balearic Islands after the Roman conquest of the 1st century BCE. According to both Strabo and Pliny the Elder, the multiplying rabbits caused famines by destroying crop yields and even collapsed trees and houses with their burrowing. The inhabitants petitioned Augustus for help, who sent troops to curb the rabbit population with the help of ferrets. Other locations where the European rabbit was introduced include: Great Britain (by the Romans following their invasion in AD 43); the Hawaiian Islands of Laysan Island (in 1903) and Lisianski Island; Oceania's Macquarie Island; Washington state's Smith Island and San Juan Island (around 1900 and later spreading to the other San Juan Islands); several islands off the coast of Southern Africa (including Robben Island); as well as Australia and New Zealand. There are two conflicting accounts over the introduction of rabbits in Ukraine. One holds that the species was brought there in the early 20th century by the Austrian nobleman Graf Malokhovsky, who released them on his estate near the Khadzhibey Estuary, while another holds that rabbits were first brought to Kherson from Switzerland in 1894-1895 by the landowner Pinkovsky. =In the British Isles= The European rabbit is widespread in both Great Britain, Ireland and most islands, except for Isles of Scilly, Rùm, Tiree, and some small Scottish islands, such as Gunna, Sanday, and most of the Treshnish Isles. It was likely first brought to Britain by the Normans after the 1066 conquest of England, as there are no pre-Norman British allusions to the animal. The rabbit was nonetheless scarce or absent throughout most of England a short time afterwards, as warrens are not mentioned in the Domesday Book or any other 11th century documents. Rabbits became well known, but not necessarily accepted members of British fauna between the 12th-13th centuries, with the first real evidence of their presence consisting of a number of bones from the midden of Rayleigh Castle, which was occupied from the 11th-13th centuries. The first references to rabbits in Ireland occur roughly at the same time as English ones, thus indicating another Norman introduction. They had become plentiful, probably at a local level, by the 13th century, as indicated by an inquisition of Lundy Island made in 1274 describing how 2,000 rabbits were caught annually. Subsequent allusions in official documents became more frequent, with the species later becoming an important food item in feasts. Increases in truly wild populations occurred slowly, primarily in the coastal areas and lowland heaths of Breckland and Norfolk. Notable population increases occurred after 1750, when changes in agricultural practices created favourable habitat, and increasing interest in game management resulted in intensive predator control campaigns. Although now common in the Scottish lowlands, the species was little known in Scotland before the 19th century. Until then, it was confined to portions of the Edinburgh district at least as far back as the 16th century, certain islands and the coastal sand dunes of the Scottish mainland. Although unknown in Caithness in 1743, the species became well established there by 1793. Myxomatosis entered Britain from France in 1953, and reached Ireland by 1954, prompting the RSPB to set up \\"Mercy Squads\\" meant to euthanise myxomatous rabbits. Major myxomatosis outbreaks still occur in Britain, peaking twice annually in during spring and especially in the late summer or autumn periods, though immunity has reduced the mortality rate from 99% to 5-33%. =In Australia= A feral rabbit on a farm in Victoria (Australia) Twenty-four specimens of the European rabbit were introduced to Australia in 1859 by estate owner Thomas Austin in Victoria. Their descendants multiplied and spread throughout the country thanks to the lack of natural predators, a conducive habitat (provided by widespread farming), and the mild Australian winters that allowed year-round breeding. Australia's native equivalent, the bilby, was quickly pushed out by the invasive rabbit. (The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection.) Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense \\"rabbit-proof fence\\" to halt the westward expansion of the infestation. The European rabbit, however, can not only jump very high but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, the intentional introduction of a virus, Myxomatosis cuniiculi, provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect vectors necessary for the spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits (the same species). Today's remaining feral rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis. A second deadly rabbit virus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), has been cleared in Australia as a biological control agent and has already killed millions of the European rabbits there. RHD was also introduced-- illegally-- in New Zealand. =In Chile= The exact date on which the European rabbit was introduced into Chile is unknown, though the first references to it occur during the mid-18th century. By the 19th century, several authors referred to the presence of both rabbits and rabbit hutches in central Chile. The importation and breeding of rabbits was encouraged by the State, as rabbits were seen as cheap sources of food for peasants. Whether or not their escape into the wild was intentional is unknown, however, warnings over the dangers of feral rabbits were raised during the early 20th century, and the species had propagated dramatically by the late 1920s in central Chile, Tierra del Fuego, and the Juan Fernández Islands. In the 1930s, the State sought to tackle the rabbit problem by banning fox hunting, though it was later discovered that indigenous South American foxes rarely preyed on rabbits, preferring native species. In modern times, the European rabbit problem has not been resolved definitively, though a deliberate outbreak of myxomatosis in Tierra del Fuego successfully reduced local rabbit populations. The species remains a problem in central Chile and on Juan Fernández, despite international financing.Camus, Pablo; Castro, Sergio; Jaksic, Fabián. \\"European rabbits in Chile: the history of a biological invasion\\". Historia (Santiago) v.4 n.se Santiago 2008. ISSN 0717-7194 Domesticated rabbits The only rabbit to be widely domesticated is the European rabbit, which has been extensively domesticated for food or as a pet. It was first widely kept in ancient Rome, where fetal rabbits were known as laurices and considered a delicacy, and has been refined into a wide variety of breeds during and since the Middle Ages. Domesticated rabbits have mostly been bred to be much larger than wild rabbits, though selective breeding has produced a range sizes from \\"dwarf\\" to \\"giant\\", which are kept as food animals and pets across the world. They have as much color variation among themselves as other livestock and pet animals. Their fur is prized for its softness; today, Angora rabbits are raised for their long, soft fur, which is often spun into yarn. Other breeds are raised for the fur industry, particularly the Rex, which has a smooth, velvet-like coat and comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes. Meat and fur In the United Kingdom, rabbit was a popular food source for the poorer classes. Among wild rabbits, those native to Spain were reputed to have the highest meat quality, followed by those in the Ardennes. As rabbits hold very little fat, they were hardly ever roasted, being instead boiled, fried or stewed. The pelt of the rabbit is heavier and more durable than the hare's.Petersen, Marcus (1914), The fur traders, and fur bearing animals, Buffalo : Hammond Press, p. 291 Marshall calculated that the value of the skin in proportion to the carcass was greater than that of the sheep and ox. Its fur is primarily used for felting or hats. It is also dyed or clipped, and sold as imitations of more valuable furbearers, such as fur seal. Although cheap and easily acquired, rabbit fur has little durability. Conservation status Though the European rabbit thrives in many of the locations where it was introduced, in its native Iberia, populations are dwindling. In 2005, the Portuguese Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests (ICNB) classified Oryctolagus cuniculus in Portugal as \\"Near Threatened\\", while in 2006, Spanish authorities (SECEM) reclassified it in Spain as \\"Vulnerable\\". In 2018, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reclassified Oryctolagus cuniculus in Spain, Portugal and France as \\"Endangered\\", due to the extent of recent declines. However, Worldwide, the species is Near Threatened.

The original founders of the organization were Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière, Jean-Jacques Olier and Pierre Chevrier. They were later joined by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance. The organization's mission was to convert the Indigenous population to Christianity and found a Christian settlement, which would be later known as Ville-Marie.  Founding and activities  Marie-Madeleine de Vignerot, the Duchess of Aiguillon, a strong lay leader of the Catholic Church, was a proponent of foreign missionaries. To develop a colony in Montreal, she instigated the formation of the Societe Notre-Dame de Montreal.Bonneau-Avenant, Alfred, LaDuchesse d’Aiguillon, Niece du Cardinal de Richelieu, Paris: Didier et Cie., 1879, p. 290 Her ideas caught the attention of De la Dauversière, Pierre Chevrier, Baron de Fanchamp and Jeanne Mance, who expressed great interest and enthusiasm. A friend of Chevrier, Jean-Jacques Olier, future founder of the Seminary of St-Sulpice also expressed great interest in the project, donating a hundred pistoles to de la Dauversière and telling him to \\"commence the work of God.\\" Olier was also instrumental in recruiting three more associates to the Society, most notably the Baron de Renty. He played an important financial role as a financial benefactor for the project. These six individuals would form the core of the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal. They intended to establish the colony for the purpose of the religious conversion of the Indigenous population, whom they considered pagans, and the development of a Christian settlement. The venture was very expensive, and the Society initially had trouble finding potential financiers.Marie-Claire Daveluy, La Société Notre-Dame de Montréal : 1639-1663 (Ottawa : Fides, 1965), 22. The next step was to acquire the rights to the Island of Montreal. At the time, the entire island had been ceded to a Jean de Lauson, the intendant of Dauphiné. Through negotiations with M. de Lauzon, the territory was formally ceded to M. de la Dauvisiere and Chevrier on 17 December 1640. On the very same day the Society engaged itself to transport thirty men, and thirty tons of provisions to New France by its own means and vessels. Planning for the eventual colonial project would take over the activities of the Society for the next year. This planning was extensive, meticulous, and closely modelled after the Quebec settlement. Ville-Marie, as the settlement was to be called, largely copied its three main institutions from the Quebec settlement. These were the clergy residences, a hospital, and a school for young Natives. The next step for the Society was to choose a secular governor for the new colony. For this they required a man with certain military capabilities, proven leadership, and notable piety. The man chosen to for the job was Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, who had a reputation for excellent military strategy, as well as piety. The King of France, Louis XIII, in recognizing the cessation of the Island of Montreal to the Society, also named de Maisonneuve the Governor of the settlement and granted him the right to use artillery and other munitions of war. De Maisonneuve and Chevrier were then jointly tasked with the provision of equipment, rations, munitions, skilled workers, and soldiers needed for the colony. From its inception the Society needed the presence of women in its colonial project. The establishment of a hospital was a key priority of the Society. Caring for the sick and wounded during this period was largely seen as women's work. Needing female caregivers who could also evangelize, the Society eventually took on four women, the most notable of which was Jeanne Mance. Mance was instrumental to the success of the society, as both a caregiver and as a financier. Though she had little of her own wealth to give to the mission, her resourcefulness in spreading the word of the Society to wealthy aristocratic women in Paris paid off greatly in the future donations these women gave to the colonial project. In the spring of 1641 three ships departed from La Rochelle to the New World with the mission of establishing a Christian colony on the Island of Montreal. One ship contained de Maisonneuve and about twenty five men, a second ship containing Jeanne Mance and a dozen men, and a third containing three women and ten men. The third ship arrived without issue and the second, containing Jeanne Mance, reached Quebec on August 8, 1641. de Maisonneuve's journey, wrought by misfortune and poor weather, caused him to lose several men and delay his arrival until August 20. De Maisonneuve's two-week absence gave rise to ridicule of the Society's mission in New France. Public and elite opinion in Quebec began to center around talks of the mission as a \\"foolhardy enterprise\\". This opinion garnered much credibility from the recent skirmishes between Iroquois and the French, which led many to believe that the settlement, having so few men to defend it, would soon be destroyed by the Iroquois. Despite the ridicule his venture received, De Maisonneuve would have carried out his mission of colonization except for the coming winter weather. The expedition's arrival in late August had delayed the colonial project considerably. Given the recent Iroquois threat and the coming frost, de Maisonneuve decided to suspend the founding of Ville Marie until next spring, spending the winter in Ste-Foye with his crew. During the winter, Mance played a critical role in managing and storing the supplies. Over the course of the winter and early spring, boat construction went on busily in Ste-Foye. On May 8, 1642, de Maisonneuve's colonizing force set out for the Island of Montreal. The Flotilla consisted of a pinnacle, a Garbarre, and two Chaloupes. On the 17th of May, the Society came into sight of the island and formally took possession of it. The next morning they made their landing at La Place Royale, an islet at the mouth of the stream which Samuel de Champlain had previously designated as a safe haven. De Maisonneuve decided that on this spot would be where he erected his fort and settlement. That day an altar was erected by Jeanne Mance and the first Mass was held on the Island of Montreal. This act symbolized the beginning of Ville Marie, the ambitious dream of La Société Notre-Dame de Montréal. Early encounters with Natives From the beginning, the area where the Society was founded was prone to attacks by neighboring Iroquois tribes. In 1650, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve returned to New France, from a voyage to France during which he met with Jeanne Mance. Mance warned de Maisonneuve of the destruction of Huronia by the Iroquois. Huron survivors of the attack fled before the onslaught and \\"passed by Ville Marie on their way to safety at Quebec – a sinister omen of things to come.\\" On May 6 165, Jean Boudart and his wife were attacked by approximately 50 natives. Boudart was killed and his wife was taken prisoner and later burnt at the stake. Charles Le Moyne, Denis Archambault and an unnamed settler quickly ran in aid of the others under attack. The three men quickly realized they were outnumbered and the only way to ensure their personal safety was to flee and thus ran they in the direction of the Hotel de Dieu hospital. As historian Henri Béchard writes, later, de Maisonneuve explained to the founder of Montreal, \\"had the Iroquois passed by the hospital before these men found refuge in it , they would have plundered, burnt it, and captured Mademoiselle Mance.\\" Four days later, on May 10, forty Iroquois attempted to set fire to the brewery as well as other establishments, mostly houses. The Iroquois would have succeeded in burning down the brewery had there not been four guards patrolling the area who effectively repelled them. On June 18, 1651, four citizens were heading home from mass when they were confronted by a group of Iroquois. When Governor Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve gained knowledge of the attack, he sent a relief party led by Charles Le Moyne to reinforce security in the area. The Iroquois quickly fired all of their ammunition, and with few weapons left to attack with, the French were able to suppress the attack. From this moment on, \\"the French were constantly harassed by the Iroquois and they no longer dared venture more than a few feet from their log-houses without their muskets, their pistols and swords. At night-time, nobody opened the door of his home to anyone.\\" After the attacks, de Maisonneuve called a meeting of all the French colonists in Ville-Marie and their families at which he instructed them to repair the fort and their residences.Daveluy M.C. & Laurent J., Jeanne Mance, 1606-1673 (Montreal: Fides, 1962), 103. As Dollier de Casson wrote, \\"as we grew weaker daily whilst the enemy grew bolder, on account of their great number, everyone saw quite plainly that unless powerful aid appeared very shortly from France, all would be lost.\\" Before departing back for France in 1651, de Maisonneuve met with the new governor of Ville-Marie who was also a member of the Society of Notre Dame, Jean de Lauson. De Lauson agreed to cover part of the cost of sending ten soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Ville- Marie. Lauson would stay true to the spirit of his word but fail on the technicalities. Governor de Lauson sent three men who were extremely malnourished and unprepared for the winter, where they almost died before reaching the settlement on December 10, 1651. On his journey back to Paris, de Maisonneuve stopped by La Fleche to speak with Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière. De Maisonneuve reported on life at Ville-Marie in 165, including the deaths caused by Iroquois attacks. The population of Ville-Marie was on the decline, there remained approximately 50 French colonists, only 17 of which could bear arms. De Maisonneuve remained in France until 1652.Marcel Trudel, Montreal: La Fondation D'une Societe 1642-1663 (Montreal: Fides, 1976), 20-21. Jeanne Mance who remained in Ville-Marie, received a letter from de Maisonneuve, in which he wrote \\" I will try to bring back 200 men, which we badly need for the defence of this place; if, however, I cannot get at least 100, I will not return and the whole enterprise must be abandoned, for certainly the place will be untenable.\\" It would not be until a year later, in 1653 when de Maisonneuve, working alongside de la Dauversiere in France, would gather up enough French men and women willing to take the voyage to New France. In the third week of June 1653, Marguerite Bourgeoys boarded the Saint Nicolas de Nantes with the prospective colonists. Despite suffering the loss of eight men during the voyage, on the 16th of November, with approximately 95 recruits, the Saint Nicolas de Nantes arrived at Ville-Marie.Marcel Trudel, Montreal: La Fondation D'une Societe 1642-1663, 21. Trudel regards the efforts of Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière, Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve and Jeanne Mance as quintessential in the \\"second founding of Montreal.\\" This so- called \\"second founding of montreal\\" is historically recognized as the rebuilding of the Ville-Marie settlement by members of the Society of Notre Dame after countless Iroquois attacks. Dissolution \\"We now come to a year which Montreal ought to mark in red letters on its calendar, on an account of the various losses sustained on several different occasions\\", wrote François Dollier de Casson in his memoirs in the fall of 1659. The Society of Notre Dame had declined and the Seminary of Saint Sulpice began taking over the administration of Ville-Marie. Within four years of Dollier de Casson's discouraging account of his time in Montreal, the Society of Notre Dame would sign over the seigneury of Montreal to the Sulpician Order. This concluded the ambitious religious project originally envisioned and funded by Jérôme le Royer de la Dauversière and his followers. By the mid seventeenth century, The Society of Notre Dame had no more than 12 surviving members, passionately led by Paul de Chomedey, Sieur De Maisonneuve. Resources were dauntingly low and money was quickly running out during a time when the Native raids called for a formidable resistance by the Frenchmen. The Iroquois forces proved resilient and capable, and fought in much larger numbers than the French population of Ville-Marie could handle. The Native warriors used the landscape to their advantage, hiding in dense unplowed fields and setting traps for unsuspecting Frenchmen. Lambert Closse, de Maisonneuve's first lieutenant, was ambushed and murdered on February 6, 1662, an event recognized by Montrealers as a major blow to the Society of Notre Dame. This style of guerilla warfare struck fear in both villagers and soldiers of Ville-Marie, as attacks were unexpected and relentless as explicitly described in Dollier de Casson's manuscripts. The anxiety of inevitable attacks burdened Ville-Marie both militarily and agriculturally. \\"Montrealers had been able to seed only part their fields the previous year, so that the year 1662 had barely begun when they found that they did not have enough food to sustain the settlement.\\" That year, Ville- Marie appealed to Quebec for provisions, receiving aid from their allies quickly. Despite the strength and fortification of Quebec, Montreal was too far away to have benefitted greatly from its protection. On March 9, 1663 the Society of Notre Dame dissolved, leaving Ville-Marie in the hands of The Sulpician Order. However, de Maisonneuve remained Governor of the island until 1665. Ville-Marie was founded 34 years after Quebec, yet this mission successfully managed a population of over 500 people. Remarkably, this population figure was equal to that of Quebec. The Society of Notre Dame \\"managed to keep their settlement unconquered by the Iroquois for twenty-three years, all while increasing tenfold its population, its resources, and its strength.\\" Despite the devastating failure of the overambitious mission of the Society, they laid the foundation for what would grow into the largest trading settlement in Canada, and established Christianity in the most impossible conditions.

The result of three years of work, the poem tells the Greek myth of Hero and Leander, two lovers, and the story of their forlorn fate. Hunt began working on the poem during the summer of 1816, arousing the interest of the publisher John Taylor, and despite repeated delays to allow Hunt to deal with other commitments the poem was finished and published in a collection 1819. Dealing with themes of love and its attempt to conquer nature, the poem does not contain the political message that many of Hunt's works around that time do. The collection was well received by contemporary critics, who remarked on its sentiment and delicacy, while more modern writers such as Edmund Blunden have criticised the flow of its narrative. Background After the decline in circulation for his paper the Examiner following Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, Hunt began to focus more on his poetry. During this time, he decided to write poems about the story of Hero and Leander along with the story of Bacchus and Ariadne. After starting on the poem about Hero and Leander during summer 1816, Hunt showed the lines to the publisher John Taylor who gave Hunt 20 guineas as a partial payment for a collection including the poem.Roe p. 265 A notice by Taylor and Hessey was sent to Hunt on 22 February 1817 asking about Hero and Leander. Percy Bysshe Shelley responded for Hunt to gain more time for Hunt to complete the volume. In June, Hunt devoted his time to work on the second edition of The Story of the Remini while hoping to finish the collection during winter 1818. However, the projected date was pushed back by the end of 1818.Roe p. 314 By July 1819, the poem, along with Bacchus and Ariadne, The Panther were finished and soon published.Roe pp. 293, 303, 316 Poem The poem tells the story of Hero and Leander in medias res and lacks context to the story. The poem begins with a description of worshipping Venus, the Greek goddess of love, and the celebration of the physical world:Edgecombe p. 97 The hour of worship's over; and the flute And choral voices of the girls are mute; And by degrees the people have departed Homeward, with gentle step, and quiet-hearted; The jealous easy, the desponding healed; The timid, hopeful of their love concealed; The sprightlier maiden, sure of nuptial joys; And mothers, grateful for their rosy boys. (lines 1–8) The poem explains what happens to material pleasure along with the connection between love and emotion. This leads back into the story of Leander's death:Edgecombe pp. 104–105 And thus it is, that happiest linked loves Glance and are gone sometimes, like passing doves; Or like two dancers gliding from a green; Or two sky-streaks, filling with clouds between, All we can hope is, that so sweet a smile Goes somewhere to continue; and meanwhile, Hopes, joys, and sorrows link our days together, Like spring, and summer-time, and wintery weather. For autumn now was over; and the crane Began to clang against the coming rain. And peevish winds ran cutting o'er the sea, Which at its best looked dark and slatily. (lines 193–204) The poem removes any emphasis on idyllic nature to describe the sublime:Edgecombe p. 105 Meantime the sun had sunk; the hilly mark, A-cross the straits, mixed with the mightier dark. And night came on. All noises by degrees Were hushed, — the fisher's call, the birds, the trees. All but the washing of the eternal seas. Hero looked out, and trembling augured ill. The darkness held its breath so very still. (lines 223–229) The poem describes how love allows Leander to swim the Hellespont to meet with Hero:Roe p. 317 He thinks it comes! Ah, yes,—'tis she! 'tis she! Again he springs; and though the winds arise Fiercer and fiercer, swims with ardent eyes; And always, though with ruffian waves dashed hard. Turns thither with glad groan his stout regard; And always, though his sense seems washed away. Emerges, fighting tow'rds the cordial ray. (lines 248–254) Leander, as he dies, keeps changing between thoughts of the divine and thoughts about the human world:Edgecombe pp. 105–106 Then dreadful thoughts of death, of waves heaped on him. And friends, and parting daylight, rush upon him. He thinks of prayers to Neptune and his daughters. And Venus, Hero's queen, sprung from the waters; And then of Hero only,—how she fares. And what she'll feel, when the blank morn appears; And at that thought he stiffens once again His limbs, and pants, and strains, and climbs,—in vain. Fierce draughts he swallows of the wilful wave. (lines 261–269) Eventually, Leander appears drowned. In the end, Hero kills herself and there is no metamorphosis as found in other versions of the story:Edgecombe p. 106 She went up to the tower, and straining out To search the seas, downwards, and round about, She saw, at last,—she saw her lord indeed Floating, and washed about, like a vile weed; On which such strength of passion and dismay Seized her, and such an impotence to stay. That from the turret, like a stricken dove. With fluttering arms she leaped, and joined her drowned love. (lines 286–293) Themes The story describes love and its attempt to conquer nature, but it also describes and a forlorn fate.Roe pp. 317–318 While many of the other works written by Hunt during the time had political themes that expressed his feelings about the actions of the British government, Hero and Leander was toned down and contained a \\"sociability\\" that was mentioned in the preface of Hunt's Foliage.Holden p. 136 When placed into a sequence with Bacchus and Ariadne, the latter story is a consolation to the themes of the first.Roe p. 318 The focus on death shows a switch between mourning along with a sort of blankness, which is similar to how Alfred Lord Tennyson approaches death in In Memoriam. In The Religion of the Heart, Hunt argued that \\"It was a great mistake of the nurturers of Christianity to preach contempt of the body, out of a notion of exalting the soul.\\"Edgecombe qtd. p. 97 Hunt, in the Indicator essay, wrote in response to the views expressed in William Wordsworth's \\"The World is Too Much With Us\\": \\"It was a strong sense of this, which made a living poet, who is accounted very orthodox in his religious opinions, give vent, in that fine sonnet, to his impatience at seeing the beautiful planet we live upon, with all its starry wonders about it, so little thought of, compared with what is so ridiculously called the world.\\"Edgecombe qtd p. 104 This view of \\"the world\\" is the same as in Hero and Leander as morality is said to limit material pleasure. Hunt also reverses the idea that pleasures are fleeting and should be rejected to claim that pleasures are fleeting because they are rejected by the world.Edgecombe p. 104 In terms of religion, Hunt returns to a mythological theme because, as he argues in The Indicator essay \\"Spirit of the Ancient Mythology\\", \\"Imagine Plutarch, a devout and yet a liberal believer, when he went to study theology and philosophy at Delphi: with what feelings must he have passed along the woody paths to the hill, approaching nearer every instant to the divinity, and not sure that a glance of light through the trees was not the lustre of the god himself going by! This is mere poetry to us, and very fine it is; but to him it was poetry, and religion, and beauty, and gravity, and hushing awe, and a path as from one world to another.\\"Edgecombe qtd. p. 98 This reality appears in the beginning of the poem with its emphasis on the temple to Venus. Hunt's approach to the service is similar to a traditional Anglican evensong. Hunt seeks to recreate the Classical religion as it was and wants to move myth beyond just simple poetry and into the realm of religion.Edgecombe pp. 98–99 Critical response The collection containing Hero and Leander was well received by contemporary critics with the London Magazine devoted a lengthy analysis to the works.Blainey 1985 p. 115 Bulwer-Lytton, in an 1832 review, claimed the poem revealed a poet that was like \\"Dryden himself, but ... with a sentiment, a delicacy, not his own.\\"Edgecombe qtd. p. 95 Edmund Blunden, in 1930, claims that the poems were \\"unequally written narratives\\".Blunden 1930 p. 140 Nicolas Roe argues that \\"Hunt's couplets can create sudden surges of energy [...] and, elsewhere in the poem, they prolong the moment when dawn slowly reveals Leanders drowned body\\".Roe p. 317-318 Although praising many of the beginning lines of the poem, Rodney Edgecombe claims, \\"Good though that is, the verse from this point onwards lacks distinction; Hunt's material has deprived him of the sort of stimuli to which his imagination ordinarily responds—he is never at home with sublimity and terror.\\" NotesReferences * Blainey, Ann.

Biography Hales graduated from Haverford College in 1972, earning a BA in English and American Literature. After spending some time in New York working as a photographer and musician, he moved to Texas in the mid-1970s to begin his graduate education under the photographers Russell Lee and Garry Winogrand. Hales completed both his MA (in 1976) and PhD (1980) at the University of Texas, specializing in American Civilization under the tutelage of cultural historians William H. Goetzmann and William Stott. In 1980, he began his academic career as a professor in the Department of Art History at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he eventually was named director of the American Studies Institute. Hales' 1984 text Silver Cities: The Photography of American Urbanization, 1839–1915, charted the transformation of America through the mass-production and distribution of photographs; its Visual Culture focus on the rapidly urbanizing nation through exploration of U.S. photographers and photographs from antebellum America to World War I represented one of the first comprehensive studies of urban photography from a cultural-history standpoint.'Thomas Bender, \\"Pioneers of the Urban Image,\\" New York Times Book Review,October 21, 1984, p.1; Robert Levine, \\"Semiotics for the Historian: Photographers as Cultural Messengers,\\" Reviews in American History vol. 13, #3 (Sept. 1985), pp. 380–385.' Hales focus eventually turned from specifically urban America to the broader changes in the nation's physical and cultural geography. His analysis concentrated on the westward expansion of the United States, particularly with regard to its settlement and the resulting industrialization of a transcontinental American culture. Hales' second book, William Henry Jackson and the Transformation of the American Landscape used the life's work of Jackson photography as a means to trace the changes in American attitudes toward the land. Over the next decades, Hales' work expanded from the history of photography to wider studies of technology, modernization and land use. He published essays, monographs and catalog essays on topics ranging from the World's Columbian Exposition, methods of rephotographic surveying, the geography of art history survey text and the images of atomic-tests in Life during the Cold War.George H. Roeder, Jr. \\"Filling in the Picture: Visual Culture,\\" Reviews in American History, Vo. 26, #1 (March 1998), p. 284.

He collaborated with a number of photographers and coauthors, including the photographers Mark Klett and Bob Thall. Hales also served as a consultant and photographer for two large urban documentary projects centered in Chicago: the Changing Chicago Project of the later 1980s, for which he photographed social rituals of the upper class, and City2000, for which he served as historian-consultant and contributed large-format images of domestic spaces. In 2006, Hales published an extensively revised and enlarged version of his first book, now renamed Silver Cities: Photographing American Urbanization, 1839–1939; the revised version included more sophisticated studies of race, ethnicity and gender, and extended the work well into the 20th century, including studies of the urban photography of the Farm Security Administration. In the beginning of the 21st century, Hales' attention turned to the virtual world, both as subject and as means of gathering and presenting historical and cultural information. With his UIC colleague Robert Bruegmann, Hales developed a website collecting and organizing visual documentation of the Chicago built environment, the Chicago Architecture Imagebase ; in addition, he developed a collaborative public- history project on the postwar American suburb, Levittown, Long Island, In April 2014, Hales' work, Outside the Gates of Eden: The Dream of America From Hiroshima to Now—a continuation of his Silver Cities project—was released. At the time of his death in the late summer of 2014 Hales had been working on projects exploring the cultural and virtual landscapes of America including extended meditations on freeways, contrails and airports, as well as the development of virtual environments such as MUDs (Multi-user domains), early interactive computer games such as Zork, and more contemporary incarnations of virtual environments like the Sims and Second Life.UIC Art History Department, Faculty Profiles, Peter Hales , Retrieved March 10, 2009.

The Skotino cave () is one of the largest and more impressive caves among the many caves found in Crete. The cave lies high on a hill northwest of the village of Skotino, a few kilometers inland south of Gouves. It is also known as Agia Paraskevi cave from the church dedicated to Saint Paraskevi built on top of it. The cave is 160 meters deep and 36 meters wide. The first archaeological examination on the site were carried out by Arthur Evans, the well-known British archaeologist who unearthed and partially restored Knossos in the early 20th century. A more comprehensive exploration was carried out by French and Greek archaeologists in the 1960s. They found a considerable number of bronze and ceramic votive offerings, the oldest of them dating from the earliest Minoan periods, suggesting the cave was an important sacred shrine dedicated to a female fertility deity, presumably Britomartis. The cave was still used in Classical Greek and Roman eras, when the fertility goddess Artemis or her Roman equivalent Diana replaced the Minoan deity.

The mountain is located to the northeast of Erhai and forms the tripoint of three counties: Heqing, Binchuan, and Dali City. Mount Jizu is a famed holy mountain in Buddhism. Its main peak, Tianzhu Peak, rises some 3,240 metres above sea level. The mountain is vegetated with dense forests and bamboo groves. With three mountain ranges to the front and one range to the rear, it appears like a cock's foot, hence its common name Mount Cock's Foot or Mt. Cock's Claw. Yet another name for this mountain is Nine Strata Cliffs. Haicheng Ling et al. (2005: p. 40) relate the experience of Xu Xiake (1586-1641): > \\"On the top of Tianzhu Peak, people can admire sun-rise in the east, sea of > auspicious clouds in the south, the Cangshan Mountain and the Erhai Lake in > the west, and the Yulong Snow Mountain in the north.

Most of the temple construction was during the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty. Temples of note are the: Xitang Temple, Shizhong Temple, Huayan Temple and Jinding Temple (Golden Top) which had been relocated from Kunming. Later, many temples fell into ruins, and now, only Zhushengsi Temple, the gate tower of Jinding Temple and Lengyan Pagoda are maintained. As Haicheng Ling et al. (2005: p. 40) hold: > \\"The first temple on Mount Jizu was built during the Tang dynasty (AD > 618-907).

It was held in New York City from February 14, 1969, until the 1980s. The first three meetings were held in artists' lofts and studios and thereafter at the Educational Alliance, 197 East Broadway, NYC. Although open to all without membership, it was intended as a forum for figurative and realistic painters and sculptors who felt isolated in an art world dominated by abstract and pop styles. The panels and individual speakers were usually artists. Bring work nights were also held. The organization was close to “anarchistic” (Tillim) and the discussions were often contentious to the point of driving people away. Philip Pearlstein noted “Between two and three hundred people showed up at these meetings. I started going there regularly. It was very exciting. All they wanted to do was to have panels and guest speakers, and just talk about the problems of figurative art representation, and the battles became terrific. It was mostly a split between the intellectuals and the expressionists; the ‘heads and the guts’”. The Artist’s Choice Museum grew out of the Alliance.

A saprobic species, it is typically found growing on the ground singly or in small groups on woody debris or leaf litter, during summer and autumn in Japan, Europe, and eastern North America. The fruit body begins its development in an \\"egg\\" form, resembling somewhat a puffball partially submerged in the ground. As the fungus matures, a slender orange to pink colored stalk emerges that tapers evenly to a pointed tip. The stalk is covered with a foul-smelling slimy green spore mass on the upper third of its length. Flies and other insects feed upon the slime which contains the spores, assisting in their dispersal. Due to their repellent odor, mature specimens are not generally considered edible, although there are reports of the immature \\"eggs\\" being consumed. In the laboratory, Mutinus elegans has been shown to inhibit the growth of several microorganisms that can be pathogenic to humans.  Taxonomy  Mutinus elegans was first described by British missionary John Banister in 1679 who chronicled the natural history of Virginia; this early report is thought to be the first account of a fungus in North America. It was first characterized scientifically by French scientist Jean Pierre François Camille Montagne in 1856, who called it Corynites elegans. The genus name Mutinus refers to the Roman phallic deity Mutunus Tutunus, one of the di indigetes placated by Roman brides. The species is commonly known variously as the \\"elegant stinkhorn\\", the \\"headless stinkhorn\\", the \\"dog stinkhorn\\", or the \\"devil's dipstick\\". The specific epithet elegans is derived from the Latin word meaning \\"graceful\\" or \\"elegant\\".  Description  Specimen from Florida, USA The young fruiting bodies are initially white and spherical or egg-shaped, partially submerged in the ground, with dimensions of by . As the fruit body matures, the egg ruptures and the spongy spore-bearing stalk emerges; fully grown, it may be from long and thick. The stalk is hollow and strongly wrinkled overall; its shape is cylindrical below, but it gradually tapers to a narrow apex with a small opening at the tip. The upper half of the stalk is bright red to reddish orange, and the color gradually loses intensity transforming into pinkish white below. The stalk may be straight, or slightly curved. A gelatinous greenish-brown gleba covers the upper third of the stalk in newly emerged specimens. The remains of the \\"egg\\" forms a volva around the base of the stalk. The odor of the gleba is foul; one author describes it as \\"sickly sweet or metallic\\". The spores are a greenish- brown color. Fruit bodies are attached to the substrate by whitish rhizomorphs that resemble plant roots. American mycologist Smith noted that the eggs are often slow to open, sometimes taking up to two weeks before the stalk expands. The spores are 4–7 by 2–3 µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and embedded in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the family Phallaceae, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3 µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation at one end of the spore, and it most likely results during the separation of the attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.  Edibility  The immature egg-forms of Mutinus elegans are edible, but \\"not recommended\\". One field guides notes that the eggs of the stinkhorn fungi \\"taste like the seasonings that are added to them.\\" The fetid odor of mature specimens would probably be repellent to most, although they are not considered poisonous.  Similar species  Compared to M. elegans, the related species M. caninus (shown here) has less of the stalk covered with gleba, and a tip that is fused together, rather than with a small opening. The \\"dog stinkhorn\\" (Mutinus caninus) is smaller, has a distinct oval or spindle- shaped tip on a slender stem and lacks the bright coloring of M. elegans; it has less of the stalk covered by gleba. The portion of the stalk below the spore mass is pitted in M. caninus, compared to \\"pebbly\\" in M. elegans. M. caninus is also less common than M. elegans. Mutinus bambusinus is similar in size and shape, except it does not have a distinct color demarcation between the upper and lower parts of the stalk; instead, the entire stem shows red pigments. The stalk of M. ravenelii is less tapered than M. elegans, and it has a clearly differentiated swollen head.  Habitat and distribution  Mutinus elegans is saprobic—deriving nutrients by breaking down dead or dying organic matter. It is commonly found in gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and logs, and in wood chips. A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the Sawtooth Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree. This common species has been collected in eastern North America, in the area extending from Quebec to Florida and west to the Great Lakes, Iowa, and Texas. In Europe, it has been reported from Netherlands and in Asia, it has been collected in Japan.  Antibiotic activity  A study of 32 basidiomycete mushrooms showed that Mutinus elegans was the only species to show antibiotic (both antibacterial and antifungal) activity against all six microorganisms tested, namely, the human pathogenic bacteris Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and the yeast Candida albicans.

The episode was directed by series creator Bill Lawrence, and written by Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. The pilot introduces seven main cast members: Jules Cobb (Courteney Cox) as a 40-year-old mother who’s newly single; Ellie Torres (Christa Miller), Jules' next door neighbor and best friend; Laurie Keller (Busy Philipps), Jules' younger employee; Bobby Cobb (Brian Van Holt), Jules' unemployed ex-husband; Travis Cobb (Dan Byrd), Jules' 17-year-old son; Andy Torres (Ian Gomez), Ellie's husband; and Grayson Ellis (Josh Hopkins), Jules' newly divorced neighbor. The episode aired between the other two pilots, Modern Family and Eastwick. It achieved 11.4 million viewers, coming first in its timeslot. Critical response was mixed, with Los Angeles Times' Mary McNamara stating that the show \\"is fun and exciting for women over 40\\" and that the \\"maddening thing about 'Cougar Town' is that it isn't completely unfunny or uncharming.\\"  Plot  Jules examines her naked body in the mirror after coming out of the shower. At a football game at her son's high school, Jules relaxes in the stands with her friend and co-worker, Laurie. They are playing the traditional game of \\"Son...or Boyfriend?\\" with a few 40-something moms sitting with much younger guys. Meanwhile, Laurie tries to convince Jules to go out and party, but Jules has two glasses of wine and a Scrabble board waiting at home for her best friend and neighbor, Ellie, to come over. However, Ellie promised her husband Andy that they would have sex at least once a month and he is making her honor the agreement. The next morning, Jules goes outside to get the newspaper and sees her 40-something neighbor, Grayson, say goodbye to another 20-something conquest. This time, she confronts him about the fact he's sleeping with sorority girls only a week after his wife leaves him. He thinks it's because she couldn't \\"bag a young stud if she tried.\\" Therefore, she tries by flashing a kid on a bicycle. The kid eventually crashes headfirst into a car. After dropping Travis off at school, he trudges off for a day of humiliation after dealing with his mom's busty real estate ads around town, and his dad's new job as his school's lawn mower. As a real estate agent, Jules has the obligatory lawn signs posted all over town. Jules is horrified that Laurie would do that, but Laurie is hell-bent on getting Jules out in the dating world. After seeing another older man with a younger girl, Laurie insists she and Jules go out and have a little fun. After arriving at the club, Jules soon meets a younger guy, Matt, and though drunk by the end of the night, she goes home alone. When Jules gets home, she is ready to share a bottle of wine with Ellie. Although, Laurie unexpectedly swings by and leaves Matt at Jules's place. Reluctantly, Jules sleeps with Matt three times. Several hours later, they are relaxing by her pool, and she wants to do something to him she always told her ex-husband she hated. As Jules attempts to go down on Matt, Bobby and Travis walk in. In the morning, she tries to apologize to Travis and explain she fears shriveling up and dying if she doesn't get out and do things. Feeling bad for Travis' bitterness toward her posters, Jules and Laurie chase down the kid responsible for stealing most of the posters.  Production = Conception  Cougar Town was created by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. Lawrence is best known as the creator of Scrubs. He drew inspiration from his real-life wife, actress Christa Miller who also stars in the show as Ellie. Lawrence and Kevin Biegel, who worked together writing episode on Scrubs, decided to create a show with Courteney Cox as a 40-year-old, newly single woman because he thought that it was a real \\"zeitgeist-y topic.\\" Cox and Lawrence had worked together on Scrubs, with Cox guest-starring in the first three episodes of the eighth season. Lawrence was also a staff writer on Friends during the show's first season. Before pitching the idea to ABC, other titles for the show included 40 and Single and The Courteney Cox Show. After pitching the idea to ABC, they asked him to have a pilot ready to shoot by the end of January 2009. Lawrence and Biegel together wrote the script with Lawrence, who has written and directed many episodes on Scrubs, directing the episode.  Filming  The series takes place in Sarasota, Florida although it is filmed at Culver Studios in Culver City, California. The pilot episode began filming in January 2009 and was directed and written by Bill Lawrence. Lawrence serves as executive producer/writer/director, Kevin Biegel as writer/co-executive producer, and Courteney Cox and David Arquette are executive producers. It is produced by Doozer Productions and Coquette Productions (headed by Cox and her husband David Arquette) and is from ABC Studios. Original music for Cougar Town is composed by singer-songwriter WAZ & the production team Golden-Sgro.  Reception  The episode was first broadcast in the United States on ABC on September 23, 2009 in the 9:30–10 p.m. (PST) timeslot. The episode drew an average of 11.28 million viewers on first broadcast. It opened with initially mixed reviews from television critics. Metacritic gave the series 49 out of 100 based on the pilot episode, from the 21 reviews it collected, and a user score of 4.5 out of 10 based on 46 votes. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot episode a B, commenting that the show mixes \\"clinical realism (when did you last hear a C-section scar used as a punchline?) with ridiculous slang (a new boob job is referred to as gorilla heads), Cougar Town is so brashly vulgar, it's endearing.\\" Tucker also stated that it \\"is so single- minded that this obsession itself becomes funny.\\" Variety stated that the show \\"does feed into the dual sense of insecurity and self-empowerment that women harbor about getting older ... though, the execution here is consistently about as subtle as a kick to the groin.\\" Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, although compared Cox's character to Elliot Reid from Scrubs, stating that Cox is \\"cartoonishly self-serious and has a propensity to say whatever it is she's thinking.\\" Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger feels that \\"'Cougar Town' is still finding itself, but it’s already much better than the title would suggest [...] the show \\"has to walk a very careful line between making fun of the cougar concept and embracing it\\" although based on the two episodes \\"'Cougar Town' is self-aware enough to pull that off.\\" USA Today was also favourable saying that the show has \\"the right cast and good writing.\\" Jezebel gave the show negative reviews stating, \\"It's clichéd, it's lame, it's undignified. It smacks of predatory desperation,\\" while Ryan Brockington of New York Post compared the show to ABC's recently canceled Samantha Who?.

Because of his efforts and those of his brother Sam, Galveston Island became a nationally known resort town during the early and mid 20th century, during a period known as Galveston's Wide-Open Era. They owned various restaurant and casino venues including the now-vanished Hollywood Dinner Club and the Balinese Room. He became an Al Capone-like figure in the city. Sometimes known as the \\"Iron Glove\\", Maceo was the enforcer and head of operations for the business empire he and his brother formed. Early life Rosario Maceo was born in Palermo, Sicily at the end of the 19th century. He had three brothers, Salvatore (Sam), Vincent, and Frank. The Maceo family immigrated to Louisiana in the United States in 1901. He trained as a barber and later moved to Galveston in 1910, shortly before World War I, to start a business eventually with his brother Sam.McComb (1986), pg. 161 Rose's command of English was never great and he was reportedly illiterate. Growth of an empire As Prohibition took hold, the Maceo brothers began to give gifts of wine (low-quality to be sure) that they were able to smuggle to their customers. As their customers became more interested in the liquor they gradually became more serious bootleggers. Rose Maceo had part of his business on Murdoch's Pier, a hangout for Ollie Quinn, leader of the Beach Gang which was one of two main gangs on the island. Rose built a relationship with Quinn and the Maceo brothers gradually allied themselves with the Beach Gang. They opened a \\"cold drink place,\\" (i.e. speakeasy) and invested in the gang's gambling operations.Cartwright (1998), pg. 209 McComb (1986), pg. 161 Eventually the Beach Gang leader Ollie Quinn and the Maceos opened the Hollywood Dinner Club, the Gulf Coast's most elegant night club at the time.Cartwright (1993)Cartwright (1998), pg. 213 Rose's ability to intimidate made him an enforcer in the organization early on. Fortuitous arrests of the leaders of the gangs allowed the Maceo brothers to gain control of the island's underworld.McComb (1989), pg. 135 The Maceos gradually invested in numerous clubs and other entertainment ventures in the city involving gambling and bootlegging. Their other big venture, besides the Hollywood, was a club and casino called Maceo's Grotto (later renamed the Balinese Room) which opened in 1929. The Maceos soon controlled most of the gambling, prostitution, and other vice on the island.Sitton (2006), pg. 145 Rose acted as the \\"inside man\\" in the organization enforcing control over the organization and the island while his brother Sam was the \\"face\\" of the organization establishing partnerships, negotiating deals, and attracting tourism and investment. The Maceos became wealthy as their businesses expanded and the island prospered. Their syndicate owned dozens of casinos and restaurants both on the island and throughout Galveston County. To compensate for the often inept and corrupt police force and judicial system on the island, Rose led a group of vigilantes known as the \\"Night Riders\\" to keep order on the island.Cartwright (1998), pg. 329 Area residents considered the island and their homes entirely safe in spite of rampant criminal activity. Personal life Rose Maceo married Frances Dispensa. Frances was described as being exceedingly kind but, like her husband, very strong. The Fertitta family and the Maceo family considered each other kin because of the marriage of Joseph Frances Fertitta to Rose's sister Olivia Maceo. The Fertittas became involved in the Maceo businesses due to this relationship. End of an era The heyday of the Free State was over by the 1940s. Because of conflicts with the United States Treasury, the Hollywood Dinner Club was shut down in the late 1930s.Burka (1983), pg. 168 The local clubs found it increasingly difficult to attract major entertainment figures. Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931 and this distinct advantage over Galveston gradually lured mob figures such as New York City's Bugsy Siegel to Las Vegas. The competition created by the up-and-coming entertainment center in the desert substantially challenged the island on the Gulf. Still even during the later years the Balinese Room was able to attract the likes of Tony Bennett and Peggy Lee, among others.Cartwright (1998), pg. 241 By the late 1940s corruption at the Texas state and county level was in decline. As investigation of the Maceo activities became more serious, Sam and Rose began plans to move their empire to Nevada. Thanks to Sam's dealings the Maceos became major investors in the Desert Inn, which opened in 1950, the largest and most elaborate casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip at the time. Sam and Rose Maceo transferred controlling interest of most of their Galveston empire to a new group dominated by the Fertitta family with investments coming from business interests around the island. The Fertitta group, however, never wielded the influence that the Maceos had. Rose Maceo died in 1954 from heart disease. His death made national obituary news.

West (February 11, 1886 – September 11, 1923) was an American motion picture director. He joined the New York Motion Picture Company in 1910 and directed more than 70 motion pictures between 1910 and 1919 before suffering a nervous breakdown that forced him to retire from the business. He died in 1923 at age 37. Biography West was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1886 and attended De La Salle College there. He moved to Los Angeles in 1910 and began working as a motion picture director for Thomas H. Ince at the New York Motion Picture Company, the second motion picture studio to begin operating in Southern California. Between 1910 and 1919, West directed 70 motion pictures. In 1914 alone, West directed 28 motion pictures. West's first important motion picture was The Alien based on George Beban's play The Sign of the Rose. His most significant films include The Wolf Woman and Civilization. During his ten-year career as a director, he worked with some of the biggest movie stars of the 1910s, including Bessie Barriscale, Charles Ray, William Desmond, Dorothy Dalton and Louise Glaum. He also directed the first film starring Alice Thomas. West was known as an expert camera man as well as a director. Many of the lighting effects that became common in the 1920s were originated, according to the Los Angeles Times, in West's \\"ever- active and inventive mind.\\" In 1917, West was also credited with developing a new standard of double exposure photography while directing in The Snarl, a motion picture in which Bessie Barriscale played two parts—sisters competing for the same man. West reportedly loved film-making \\"so intensely that he hardly took time to eat or sleep.\\" He suffered a nervous breakdown in or about 1919 that ended his career as a director. He never recovered and never directed another motion picture. He died in 1923 at his home on Horne Avenue in West Hollywood, California. West was survived by his wife and a son, Vincent West.

If built correctly, a system built on the RUSH algorithms will have the following characteristics: (some of the text below is taken from the algorithm whitepaper) * Ability to map replicated objects to a scalable collection of storage servers or disks without the use of a central directory. * Redistributes as few objects as possible when new servers are added or existing servers are removed * Guarantees that no two replicas of a particular object are ever placed on the same server. * No central directory, clients can compute data locations in parallel, allowing thousands of clients to access objects on thousands of servers simultaneously. * Facilitates the distribution of multiple replicas of objects among thousands of disks. Allows individual clients to compute the location of all of the replicas of a particular object in the system algorithmically using just a list of storage servers rather than relying on a directory. * Easy scaling management. Scaling out is just a matter of deploying new servers and then propagating a new configuration to all of the nodes. The data will automatically and optimally be moved to accommodate the new resources. De- allocating resources is basically the same process in reverse. Simply deploy the new configuration and the data will be moved off the old resources automatically. After the data has been moved, simply take the old resources off line. * Easier server management. Since there is no central directory, there are no master or slaves to configure. No master or slaves means that all resources are utilized and no servers sit unused as \\"hot\\" spares or backups. * No single point of failure. As long as the replica to node ratio is correct, your data will be safe, redundant, and durable; able to withstand major server outages with no loss.

Flores (August 12, 1900 – December 18, 1981) was the fourth civilian appointed Governor of Guam, and was the first Chamorro to hold the office. He also founded the island's first locally owned newspaper, the Guam Daily News (later becoming the Pacific Daily News), which was the only local newspaper until 1966.Cunningham and Beaty (2001), 293. He enjoyed success running many publications before being appointed Governor by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960. As Governor, Flores pushed for increased self-governance in Guam, resigning in 1961. After his Governorship, Flores founded other businesses and became involved in numerous community organizations. He was a Knight of St. Sylvester. Life and career=Early life Flores was born on August 12, 1900 in Hagåtña, Guam, and received all of his education on the island. As a teenager, Flores worked for the United States Navy government in Guam as a messenger, and an operator at the Naval cable station.Babauta (2009). During World War I, Flores enlisted in the Navy, though he never saw combat. After leaving the Navy, Flores moved to San Francisco and married his wife Angela. Publishing career While in San Francisco, Flores opened a small print shop and began printing a four-page weekly newspaper, the South of the Market Street Tribune. The South of the Market Tribune turned a good profit until the Great Depression and a printing worker's strike forced it out of business. However, by the end of World War II, Flores ran and published five newspapers. Flores returned to Guam in 1947 to partner with his brothers Joaquin and Jesus Flores in an import company called Flores Brothers in Hagåtña. Upon his return, he purchased the Naval newspaper publication Guam News for $37,000 in 1950, renaming it the Guam Daily News and making Flores the first local newspaper publisher in Guam.Rogers (1995), 209. Later, Flores began publishing the Territorial Sun, a Sunday newspaper, and continued publishing for twenty years, when he sold the Guam Daily News to Chin Ho for $1.2 million, who later sold it to Gannett Company.Rogers (1995), 240. Personal life Flores was married to Angela Perez Flores and had one child named Edward. Governorship President Eisenhower appointed Flores Governor of Guam in 1960, making Flores the first locally born Chamorro to hold the office.Wuerch and Ballendorf (1994), 28.The Virgin Island Daily News (1960), 1. His nomination followed the resignations of Richard Barrett Lowe and the subsequent acting governor Marcellus Boss. During his governorship, Flores pushed for Guamanian self-governance and a Delegate from Guam to the United States, and opened public health centers in various locations. In addition, he aided in making the University of Guam a land-grant university. When John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, became president, Flores resigned on May 20, 1961, as a courtesy, after only one year in office. Post-governorship After leaving office, Flores founded a number of companies, including the Guam Savings and Loan Association in 1954, now named BankPacific and run by his grandson Phillip Flores, Mariannas Finance Corporation, Pacific American Insurance Company, and Guam Air Lines, and owned a number of office buildings and an apartment buildings. In addition to his entrepreneurial work, Flores served on a number of boards, including chairing the University of Guam Board of Regents and the Territorial Planning Commission, and a member of the Guam Chamber of Commerce, Young Men's League of Guam, and the Elks Club. He died on December 18, 1981, by his long illness at the age of 81. Awards and legacy Flores was a Knight of St. Sylvester and was inducted into the Guam Chamber of Commerce Hall of Fame in 1992. In the 1960s, Governor Joseph F. Flores Beach Park was named in his honor.

The restaurant spanned three floors, with the counter on the ground floor, the tables and restaurant on the first floor, and the salon bar and terrace on the upper floor. The restaurant was run by French celebrity chef, Joël Robuchon, while the executive chef is Jeremy Page. Description The restaurant was located near Covent Garden, close to fellow restaurant The Ivy. It was opened in 2006, with the L'Atelier ground floor promising no-reservations required outside of 5pm to 7pm, which at the time caused some consternation for food critics who wished to review it. As with the other L'Atelier restaurants, the seating is laid out around an open kitchen, with the entire floor of the building decorated in black and red. La Cuisine is on the second floor, which is a formal sit down restaurant, and there is a bar on the third floor. It is one of twelve L'Atelier de Joël Robuchons around the world. The executive chef of the restaurant was Jeremy Page, and the Chef Patron was Joël Robuchon. Page, who previously worked in other Robuchon restaurants, took over from Xavier Boyes after his departure. Reception Joe Warwick in the book Eat London says of it, \\"the ground floor is a low-lit combination of black and red that makes it look like a giant bento box at battle with a 80s cocktail bar. Customers sit along a sleek shiny counter and eat small plates of some of possibly the most exquisiste seasonal French cooking currently in London.\\" Donald Strachan of Frommer's says of the restaurant, \\"for the most dramatic effect, eat at Atelier's counter. Here you can watch the theatre of the chefs producing tapas-style dishes - small bombshells of taste as in beef and foie gras mini-burger; pig's trotter on parmesan toast; and the signature egg cocotte with wild mushroom cream, all wildly inventive and beautifully presented. The a la carte menu follows the conventional three course approach, using superb ingredients.\\" Time Out in its London edition, described the interior of the restaurant as a \\"smart if slightly dated bento-box aesthetic of shiny reds and blacks\\", but praised the quality of the food overall, in particular the onglet with polenta. Jay Rayner visited the restaurant for The Observer shortly after it opened. After waiting forty minutes for a seat in the bar area which he described as \\"like being locked in a PVC fetishist's knicker drawer\\", he described the open kitchen design as a \\"joyous experience\\". However, he disliked some elements of the food, including Robuchon's take on spaghetti bolognese to which he remarked \\"Sun-dried tomatoes and olives in a bolognese? Oi! Robuchon! NO!\\" but thought that the sweetbreads were exemplary, and enjoyed the other elements of the meal. Matthew Norman ate at the restaurant following its opening for The Guardian, giving it a score of 8/10 overall, stating \\"what we most admired about the cooking was the lack of fuss and poncery\\". The Independent's Terry Durack also visited around the same time, and thought that while the pricing structure was a \\"nightmare\\", he gave it a score of 16/20 which marked the restaurant as being \\"capable of greatness\\".
