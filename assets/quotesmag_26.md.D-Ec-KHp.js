Its church is known for having a staircase of 126 steps, a panoramic view of the town of Sta. Maria and Laguna lake, and the festivity of the Three Kings every January 6, a re-enactment of the Magi's journey.  Church history  Mabitac was under the patronage of Nuestra Se√±ora de Candelaria or the Our Lady of Candles. The image of Nuestra Se√±ora de Candelaria was commissioned between 1599 and 1600 by the alferez, Don Cristobal Mercado for Paco Church. After three years, in 1603, it was first brought to a hospital-chapel in Los Banos. It was transferred to Siniloan in 1615 upon the request of Father Juan Miguel de Talavera to his superior, Father Blas de la Madre de Dios. His plan was to place it on a little mount between Inaguasan and Galoy, two barrios of Siniloan, in aid of unification around his place. The people of Mabitac sought the image to be placed in Mabitac and was enthroned to their town in that same year. The first church of Mabitac was the aforementioned church between the two barrios of Siniloan. Due to flooding, the Franciscans transferred the church on top of Calvary or Kalbaryo Hill in 1618 and made it out of stone. Originally, the church only had 96 steps but further improvements increased it to more than 120 steps. It was seriously damaged during the 1880 earthquake and repaired under the supervision of Father Antonio de la Fuente and again severely damaged during the 1937 earthquake.  Features  The church is known for its 126 steps connecting the local road to the main church on top of the hill. It has a Spanish style fa√ßade. Due to natural calamities and war, only the belfry connected to the church is the remaining original structure of the original 1618 church. Since it became serviceable after the 1937 earthquake, the church was greatly improved into its interior.

Ecology T. cincinnatus inhabits many kinds of benthic environments ranging from mud to rocks, where it constructs a tube made by secretions, which it attaches to a substrate. Often small sand grains and shell fragments can be seen on the tube. It is possible for the worm to turn around inside the tube, and can therefore extend its feeding tentacles outside of either end of the tube.

Nobel tested others of those devices on the market and found many to be ineffective. After failing to find anyone to publish his findings, he set up the Emergency Care Research Institute in the 1960s (now ECRI Institute) to publish the Health Devices Journal, which shared information about medical devices. Nobel invented the MAX cart, which was a new type of crash cart. Personal life He was married first to Bonnie Sue Goldberg, and later to Qingqing Lu. He died at his Gladwyne, Pennsylvania home from complications of cancer and diabetes, at age 79. He was survived by his sons Joshua and Adam, and daughter Erika.

Achellam spoke Arabic, a skill he used to help manage the LRA‚Äôs strategic relationship with the Sudanese government in Khartoum. Before Achellam's capture, his relationship to Joseph Kony was uncertain. For years, Achellam's group operated in close proximity to Kony's group, but Kony placed Achellam under house arrest in mid-2007 because of his opposition to seriously engaging the Juba peace negotiations. Achellam had instead urged Kony to reconnect with the Sudanese military officers in South Darfur. Vincent Otti, then Kony's ranking deputy, convinced Kony to pursue the peace talks and openly accused Achellam of having received money from the Sudanese without disclosing it to Kony. However, following Otti's execution in late 2007, Kony exonerated Achellam and reinstated his status as a senior commander. Achellam was taken into custody by Ugandan military forces near the CAR/Congo border in May 2012.

P2 Plattenbau prototype in Fennpfuhl, Berlin Kitchen pass-through in a P2 Plattenbau The first WBS 70 apartment building, in Neubrandenburg Wilfried Stallknecht (born 12 August 1928 in Geringswalde, Germany) is a German architect, planner and furniture designer. He is known chiefly for his significant role in shaping Germany's post-World War II built environment ‚Äì particularly that of the former East Germany (GDR) ‚Äì through his major contributionsVolker Wagner: Stallknecht, Wilfried. In: Wer war wer in der DDR? 5. Ausgabe, Band 2, Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 2010. . Available online to the designs of the country's ubiquitous, iconic and often standardized housing blocks ‚Äì the so-called Plattenbau ‚Äì as well as a similarly ubiquitous and standardized single-family house design known as the EW58. He was affiliated with the GDR's Bauakademie from 1959 to 1973 and served as planner for the town of Bernau bei Berlin from 1974 to 1984.  Life and Works  In 1932, Stallknecht's father bought a vacant factory in Geringswalde in which he began producing clocks and tables.Danuta Schmidt: Entwurf f√ºrs Leben. In: Neues Deutschland, 12. August 2013 His mother was an accountant.Ausstellungskatalog (pdf; 57,1 MB) At the factory he entered a carpentry apprenticeship which was interrupted in 1944 upon his conscription into an anti-aircraft auxiliary. After the war, the family factory was expropriated, becoming a state-owned enterprise, the Geringswalde Table Factory, and there the son completed his apprenticeship. After a compulsory work detail in 1949 at a uranium ore mine of the Soviet-German Bismuth Corporation (SDAG Wismut), Stallknecht entered the Fachschule f√ºr angewandte Kunst in Erfurt (College of Applied Art) where he studied interior design and obtained a cabinetmaking diploma, graduating in 1951 The following year he joined the Project Planning Berlin state-owned enterprise and participated in the design of interiors for prestigious East German buildings such as the Wilhelm Pieck High School at the Bogensee. Joining the newly founded Design Institute (Institut f√ºr Entwurf, later Zentralinstitut f√ºr Typung) a year later, he witnessed the genesis of the GDR's standardized housing structures, which would go on to be a major influence on his career. Around this time he became interested in architecture proper and in 1954 designed a standardized series of private homes which he later described as \\"a blow to increasing standardization\\", as a number of different houses could be built based on it. They were not mass-produced, however, due to the diversity of floor plans and window sizes. A commission for a series of houses resulted in the design known as the EW58, which went on to become widely popular, with about 500,000 being built in the GDR beginning in 1958. The house was relatively affordable, often constructed by the owners with the help of neighbors, and has an important role in the material form of the country's postwar peri-urban and rural life.Wilfried Stallknecht biography at Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Regionalentwicklung und Strukturplanung; The EW58's simple design was frequently modified by its owners in an ad-hoc fashion with individualized elements such as enlargements, finished basements, and balconies. By 1959 Stallknecht was a researcher for the architect Hermann Henselmann at the Bauakademie, focusing on \\"industrial\\" building for providing rapid access to new housing for large numbers of people. Together with the architects Achim Felz and Herbert Kuschy he developed the \\"P2\\" panel building system. The standardized apartment blocks based on this design provided clean new housing on an unprecedented scale for millions whose homes had been damaged or destroyed in the war. For the first prototype building, in Berlin's Fennpfuhl district, he designed an open pass-through between kitchen and living-dining area, an influential innovation that came to be a defining feature of countless apartments of the era. The prototype building has been under historic preservation protection since the 1980s. His involvement with the P2 continued through the course of his affiliations with a number of institutes at the Bauakademie. It was Stallknecht's idea to add curves to the P2 type, first realized at Berlin's Lenin Square (now United Nations Plaza) in a housing development commonly referred to as the Wohnschlange (housing- snake).Interviewfilm Later he and Felz developed a P3 type, and the Plattenbau 69 study from around the same time later became the basis for the widely built WBS 70 building series. At the Berlin-Wei√üensee Art College he undertook postgraduate studies, writing a thesis, \\"Residential Building Requirements of Advanced Socialist Society in the GDR\\", and in 1978 completing a doctoral dissertation, \\"Plattenbau Construction Concepts for the Transformation of Inner-City Residential Areas\\". In addition to lecturing at the Hochschule f√ºr Architektur und Bauwesen Weimar he completed his habilitation with the dissertation \\"Flexible Space in Industrial Housing in the GDR\\". In 1974 Stallknecht became director of planning for the town of Bernau, ten kilometers north of Berlin. His projects included the Cafe am Pulverturm, the Steintor tavern, and most notably, prefabricated handicapped-accessible housing. Stallknecht's carpentry training served as preparation for his work on interiors and furnishings design, such as his 1968 design for the \\"Selio\\" convertible armchair-ottoman-daybed, although as of 2013 it had not found a manufacturer. Stallknecht remained active after the 1990 German unification, participating in symposia, serving as consultant for the town of Bernau, and planning and building a passive-solar house. He submitted more than 20 patents ‚Äì most recently in 2013 ‚Äì including one for a \\"slide-tipping\\" construction method (Gleit-Kipp-Verfahren) for erecting residential buildings in a horizontal position and then raising them upright. Similar methods can be applied to chimney construction, resulting in economies and cost savings. As of 2013 Stallknecht works on retrofitting solar cells to balconies and facade elements for a public housing society in Dresden. Small wind turbines for housing complex roofs are also under consideration. Wilfried Stallknecht lives with his family in the Fennpfuhl district of Berlin in a prefabricated housing complex.

It supports the BDS Movement and its call for boycott, divestment and sanctions towards Israel until it ends the occupation of the Palestinian territories, acknowledges Palestinian refugees' right to return to their homes, and recognises the right of Palestinian-Arab citizens of Israel to full legal and political equality. The organisation has successfully pressured Scottish cultural bodies to return sponsorship monies to the Israeli Embassy; one such success in 2009 led US Secretary of State to intervene clandestinely against the group. Demonstrations in 2014 successfully forced Fringe productions funded by the Israeli government to close. Campaigning against the Jewish National Fund led to a number of JNF fundraisers being cancelled. The organization has been harshly criticized in the Scottish press for alleged anti-Semitism, including their hounding of a Jewish businessman across Scotland. The organisation rejected the allegations, claiming anti-racist credentials.  Current campaigns  The organisation is currently involved with others in a Time to Divest Campaign to pressure Scottish local councils to have their substantial pension funds divest from armament and other companies that supply Israel or otherwise operate in support of Israel's illegal occupation of the West Bank.  Structure  Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign was founded in Edinburgh during September 2000 at the start of the Second Palestinian Intifada, or Al Aqsa Intifada. A handful of individuals operating as the Edinburgh Ad-hoc Committee on Palestine responded to the Palestinian Intifada and began to attract support by opposing the Israeli repression that followed and what it claimed was UK Government complicity in support of Israel. Independently of the London-based Palestine Solidarity Campaign, the group adopted the name of Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign on the suggestion of a member who had been active in the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign in the 1960s and 1970s. The organisation has branches and members at large across Scotland. It was affiliated to London- based PSC for two years in 2009 and 2010 but ended its affiliation after PSC voted against boycotting the Israeli Histadrut trade union in 2009 and confirmed that position in 2010.  Influence  In December 2004, SPSC launched a successful campaign to have Israeli political prisoner Mordechai Vanunu elected as Rector of Glasgow University A spokesman for the Israeli Information Office in Scotland claimed that Vanunu had contributed information that led to a successful terrorist attack and the killing of three nuclear plant workers, a claim rejected by SPSC. The Scottish Council of Jewish Communities alleged that the Vanunu4Rector Campaign was guilty of antisemitism for reporting that Vanunu \\"has been assaulted by Jewish extremists\\" in Israel. They further claimed that an un-named Vanunu supporter during the election had campaigned with the slogan, 'Jews are evil'. Israeli daily Haaretz reported that \\"while similar boycott efforts also occur in England, there is a consensus that 'it's worse in Scotland.' One Israeli diplomat reported that \\"Every appearance by an official Israeli representative in Scotland is like a visit to enemy territory.\\" \\" Scottish Friends of Israel website thought that ‚Äú‚Ä¶Scotland has witnessed a noticeable public anti-Israel sentiment, prominently driven by the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign‚Ä¶‚Äù Ezra Golombok of the Israeli Information Office wrote that ‚Äú,,,a highly active anti-Israeli lobby in Scotland\\"...the Palestine Solidarity Campaign \\"seems well-funded and its few activist leaders are knowledgeable, expert in exploiting any situation for sniping at Israel...\\" Golombok, Israeli Information Office, Scotland (2010) A 2011 Motion (EDM 1677) to the Westminster Parliament in the name of Jeremy Corbyn and Gerald Kaufman secured 69 signatories.

Biography During the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), Woapalanne led war parties from Bald Eagle's Nest (present day Milesburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania) against white settlements in the West Branch Susquehanna Valley.

Its imagery is primarily represented by Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, who are credited for the sound's instigation via their debut single \\"Surfin'\\" in 1961. Along with Jan and Dean, the Beach Boys encapsulated surfing, hot rod culture, and youthful innocence within music which transformed a local lifestyle into American mythology. The Beach Boys' surf music was not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, previous surf musicians did not project a worldview as the Beach Boys did. Other proponents included songwriters and/or record producers Gary Usher, Curt Boettcher, Bruce Johnston, Terry Melcher, and Roger Christian. The California sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature worldview, becoming less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war. A derivative form of the California sound was later classified as sunshine pop. Origins A young couple watching the sunset on a Los Angeles beach with surfboard in hand The genesis of the California sound is said to be the Beach Boys' debut single \\"Surfin'\\" in 1961. While the band's leader Brian Wilson then collaborated with Jan Berry for several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded as the California sound. University of Southern California history professor Kevin Starr has stated that the band was historically important for embodying the era of the Silent Generation, which he described as unpolitical. He explained that the group \\"could not help but mythologize a landscape and way of life that was already so surreal, so proto-mythic, in its setting. Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: Here was a way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound.\\" The California sound was thus a musical translation of the California myth. In the book Pioneers of Rock and Roll: 100 Artists Who Changed the Face of Rock, Harry Sumrall summarized: The Beach Boys' surf music was not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, previous surf musicians did not project a worldview as the Beach Boys did. Wilson once said of its myth: \\"It's not just the surfing; it's the outdoors and cars and sunshine; it's the society of California; it's the way of California.\\" Al Jardine of the Beach Boys argued that \\"It's not entirely a myth. There are still some elements that are certainly true, especially for a first-time observer. But to be able to come here and to drive that coast on Route 1 ... you experience the water and the animals and the sea life, the whole thing. It's really magical. It really is.\\" Capitol Records staff producer Nick Venet, who worked with the group early on, believed that most of the group's lyrical inspiration was drawn from Hollywood films. AllMusic's review of the group's \\"All Summer Long\\" calls it a \\"potent example\\" of the California myth's \\"idyllic dream world of sun, surf, and fun\\" while containing qualities of sunshine pop. Author Luis Sanchez believes that the entirety of the album All Summer Long (1964) was \\"the nearest the Beach Boys ever got to a perfect version of the California myth.\\" David Howard wrote that \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" was a \\"subtle harbinger for the growing dichotomy within the California sound. While 'I Get Around' symbolized the sunshine ideal in all its carefree splendor, 'Don't Worry Baby' suggested something entirely more pensive and even slightly dark underneath its pristine facade.\\" Cultural expansion The Beach Boys continued expanding their version of the California myth until it could no longer be confined to pop music terrain, transcending the limits of genre, commercial expectations, and geography. Aiding this was Wilson's successes with collaborator Gary Usher. The duo helped create a major new market revolving around the California sound, allowing musicians Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher to turn their attention to the Rip Chords, a group who then had hits with the hot-rod themed \\"Hey Little Cobra\\" and pseudo-surf \\"Summer Means Fun\\". Historian Matthew Allan Ides wrote: Historian Kirse Granat May describes the cultural reverberation of both surfing culture and the California sound: Touching specifically on the difference between the Beach Boys' album Surfin' U.S.A. (1963) and others' exploitation of California themes, Luis Sanchez writes: \\"You could call The Beach Boys' version of Southern California cutesy or callow or whatever, but what matters is that it captured a lack of self-consciousness‚Äîa genuineness‚Äîthat set them apart from their peers. And it was this quality that came to define Brian's oeuvre as he moved beyond and into bigger pop productions that would culminate in Smile.\\" Reinvention and decline Terry Melcher (left) with the Byrds' Gene Clark and David Crosby The result of Wilson's increasingly artistic interpretations of pop music form helped transform the California sound into a more musically ambitious and mature worldview. Melcher soon worked with the Byrds, producing their 1965 folk rock single \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". Its recording was based on Wilson's production approach to \\"Don't Worry Baby\\". Melcher's \\"commercially golden formula\\" with the Byrds was immediately co-opted by many Los Angeles-based recording artists such as the Turtles, the Leaves, Sonny & Cher, and Barry McGuire. The lyricism behind the California sound gradually became less to do with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. In Bill Flanagan's view, after the Beach Boys epitomized the California sound, Crosby, Stills, & Nash \\"ratified it\\". Arnold Shaw summarized in The Rock Revolution (1969): In September 1965, Wilson was quoted saying: \\"I HATE so-called 'surfin' music.' It's a name that people slap on any sound from California. Our music is rightfully 'the Beach Boy sound'‚Äîif one has to label it.\\" By 1966, Wilson had already begun moving away from the supposed lightweight themes that had established his group's image, expressing a willingness to \\"get out of the Eisenhower mindset\\" as told by collaborator Van Dyke Parks. Meanwhile, Gary Usher was enlisted by the Byrds to helm their transitional 1967 release Younger Than Yesterday which incorporated folk rock, jazz- influenced pop, novelty space rock, and colorful psychedelia. In Howard's description, \\"One can view the evolution of the California Sunshine Sound as a mirror of the evolution of the 1960s. Commencing with its post-Eisenhower narrative and insulated complacency, the early California sound was predicated on Wilson, Usher, and Melcher's simple fun-in-the-sun ideals.\\" It ran into decline by the end of the 1960s due to the West Coast's cultural shifts occurring in tandem with the psychological descent of Wilson and Melcher's associations with the Manson murders, with Howard calling it the \\"sunset of the original California Sunshine Sound ... [the] sweetness advocated by the California myth had led to chilling darkness and unsightly rot\\". Later years According to Flanagan, by the 1970s, the \\"spirit\\" of the California sound was kept fresh by singer‚Äìsongwriters such as Lowell George, Jackson Browne, Tom Waits and Rickie Lee Jones while avoiding what Flanagan called the sound's \\"clich√©s\\". The magazine Paste credited a 2010s revival of surf rock and the California sound to the success of bands like Best Coast, Dum Dum Girls and Wavves. In November 2009, Pitchfork ran an editorial feature which mentioned the Beach Boys as a \\"looming figure\\" throughout that summer's indie music scene termed the \\"Summer of Chillwave\\" elaborating that it is \\"not to say that any of this music sounds like the Beach Boys, or even tries to. ... The Beach Boys exist in this music in an abstracted form-- an idea, rather than a sound, as it's often been ... Summertime now is about disorientation: 'Should Have Taken Acid With You'; 'The Sun Was High (And So Am I)'; You take the fantasy of [their] music-- the cars, the sand, the surf-- add a dollop of melancholy and a smudge of druggy haze, and you have some good music for being alone in a room with only a computer to keep you company.\\" Genres =Surf music= The California sound is sometimes referred to interchangeably with surf music. =Folk rock= California folk rockers included the Byrds, Barry McGuire, and the Mamas & the Papas. =Sunshine pop= Efforts by Curt Boettcher in 1966 created an offshoot of the California sound directed toward sunshine pop. Other California sounds Some areas within the state of California are connected to their own distinguished \\"sounds\\" including the San Francisco sound (San Francisco, 1960s) and the Bakersfield sound (Bakersfield, 1950s). Ides noted: \\"The Los Angeles sound as popularized in the mainstream obscured or disregarded the contributions made by the working-class, the nonwhite and women.\\" In a Flavorwire article which asks \\"What is the quintessential California sound?\\", the journal lists 30 of what it considers \\"the most Californian albums ever made\\", elaborating that \\"the sound itself is important, but it's the lifestyles behind these scenes that come to define the music.\\" In alphabetical order, the artists mentioned are: Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Dead Kennedys, Fleetwood Mac, Germs, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, Jefferson Airplane, Joni Mitchell, Kendrick Lamar, Love, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, N.W.A, No Doubt, Queens of the Stone Age, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sly & the Family Stone, Snoop Dogg, the Doors, the Go-Go's, the Grateful Dead, the Offspring, Tupac Shakur, and X.

The second version, supported by Monteiro's written documents, is that he was tired of the problems created by his fellow scholars that were blocking his attempts to modernize Mathematics in Portuguese universities.

In 2012 she was awarded South Africa's highest honour, the Order of Mapungubwe (Silver). She became the first female president of the South African Medical Research Council in 2014, was recognised as one of the \\"100 Most Influential People\\" by TIME in 2017 and was listed amongst \\"Africa's 50 Most Powerful Women\\" by Forbes Africa in 2020. Her research expertise involves developing microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV vaccines. Some of her work has been controversial. Early life, education and career  Gray was the fifth of six children born in the gold mining town Boksburg, South Africa in 1962. Her father was a mechanical engineer at the mines and her mother was a bookkeeper. Under the apartheid government of the time, Boksburg was a low income, racially segregated town. Her family were not typical of the residents of the town in that they had black friends. Gray decided from the age of 6 that she would become a doctor. Her family valued education greatly: her father was the first in his family to attend college and five of the six children went to university. Three of them, including Gray, continued to higher degrees and pursued academic careers, but their father did not live to see this as he died when Gray was 16. = Anti- apartheid activism = Gray entered the University of the Witwatersrand in 1980 where she studied at the medical school for six years followed by seven years of specialisation in pediatrics. Her siblings were already at the university and one of her brothers was involved with a radical student union that was opposed to apartheid. Gray joined the Health Workers Association, a group intent on desegregating South Africa's hospitals. In 1983 the first HIV/AIDS cases and deaths were confirmed in South Africa and Gray committed to educating South African communities about how to prevent HIV. = HIV research and activism = By the time that Gray completed her training as a paediatrician in 1993, HIV was prevalent among many children admitted to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, the largest hospital in Africa, situated on the outskirts of South Africa's largest black township, Soweto. In 1993 Gray, along with a colleague James McIntyre, co-founded a perinatal HIV clinic. Glenda Gray (right) at the Fogarty NIH 50th symposium, 1 May 2018 In 1996, Gray started the UNAIDS PETRA study, in five urban settings in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda, to determine the effectiveness of a shorter anti- retroviral regimin. In 1999 she was awarded an International Fogarty Fellowship to study Clinical Epidemiology. She was the executive director of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit (PHRU), part of the Medical School of the University of the Witwatersrand, based at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital prior to her appointment as president of the medical research council in 2014. HIV was generally not recorded as a cause of death during the 1990s and 2000s but its effects could be seen in the infant and child mortality rates. In early 2020, an efficacy study for an HIV vaccine led by Gray was stopped early. The study, involving 5407 HIV-uninfected participants, was started in 2016 and should have continued until 2022. However, preliminary data viewed in January 2020 to evaluate safety and efficacy showed 129 HIV infections in the vaccinated group and 123 in the placebo control group. Many HIV scientists did not believe the study would succeed, as a previous efficacy study in Thailand had shown an efficacy of only 31%. Gray believed that owing to the severity of the HIV epidemic in South Africa a new trial was worthwhile pursuing. The independent monitoring board that evaluated the interim results concluded that it was futile to continue with the study.  Recognition and membership  Gray is a member of the Academy of Science of South Africa, a foreign associate of the United States Institute of Medicine, an A-rated National Research Foundation of South Africa scientist, a co-principal investigator for the HIV Vaccine Trials Network and a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology. In addition: * In 1997 Gray was awarded \\"Femina Woman of the 90's\\". * Gray was profiled as one of the \\"Icons of the Century\\" in Longevity Magazines Millennium Collectors issue. * In 2001, Science magazine profiled Gray and her colleague, James McIntyre. * Gray was presented with the 2002 Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights by Nelson Mandela. * In 2003, Gray was profiled in the book Inspirational Women at Work. * In 2009 she was awarded the N‚ÄôGaly ‚Äì Mann lectureship in recognition of her HIV research contribution. * She holds an honorary doctorate from Simon Fraser University awarded in 2012. * In 2013, she was awarded the \\"Outstanding African Scientist Award\\" by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership. * In 2014, Gray became the first woman president of the medical research council. * Gray was elected a member of the African Academy of Sciences in 2015. * Gray was named one of \\"The 100 Most Influential People\\" by TIME in 2017. * In 2019 Rhodes University in Grahamstown awarded Gray an honorary doctorate in laws (LLD, hc). * Gray was listed amongst \\"Africa's 50 Most Powerful Women\\" by Forbes Africa in 2020.  Controversies  = Infant formula = Gray has not been a stranger to controversy. At her first research presentation in 1996 at an international AIDS conference, she championed the position that HIV positive women in developing countries should feed their babies infant formula rather than breast milk to avoid the transmission of HIV from mother to child. The prevailing opinion at that time was that the risk of infant death by diarrheal diseases, caused by mixing contaminated water with the infant formula, outweighed the chance of contracting HIV. Gray's research in the Soweto communities indicated that infant formula could be safely used, but this put her in direct conflict with the activists who had led boycotts against Nestle, because of their infant formula, since the 1970s. Subsequent research on the topic demonstrated high deaths in formula fed compared to breastfed children of HIV-infected mothers. = AZT = The drug Zidovudine (also known as azidothymidine (AZT)) is an anti-retroviral drug that can be used to prevent the transmission of HIV from mother to child during childbirth. The course of the treatment was 14 weeks, and women in developing countries could not afford this. Despite criticism from an editorial of The New England Journal of Medicine, Gray conducted a trial (replicating a study from Thailand) using a shorter course of treatment against a placebo which proved that the shorter couse was effective. However, the South African government, under president Thabo Mbeki and health minister Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma, refused permission for the drug to be used, as it was considered too expensive. Gray was involved in the clandestine procurement of the drug and treatment of patients, in opposition to the government. Gray was involved in starting the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), along with Zackie Achmat and others, as an HIV/AIDS activist organisation. Only after Gray received the 2002 Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights and the legal battles in 2003 involving the TAC, were nevirapine, a drug more effective than AZT in preventing mother to child transmission of HIV, and other anti-retrovirals officially sanctioned by the government for use in South Africa. By then, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma had been replaced as Minister of Health by Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and the argument against anti-retrovirals had changed from one of affordability to the endorsement of traditional African medicine over conventional treatment. = COVID-19 = In 2020 Gray was appointed to the South African government's Medical Advisory Committee owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. On 26 March 2020, the South African government imposed an almost total lockdown on all inhabitants. From 1 May 2020, the lockdown was gradually lifted under a five-stage plan. On 15 May 2020, Gray said, \\"Initially, there was good reason to implement the lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus and buy time to ready the health system, and this was largely achieved\\". She now felt that \\"the lockdown should be eradicated completely, and that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), such as handwashing, wearing masks, social distancing and prohibitions on gatherings, should be put in place.\\" In addition she noted that: * An increasing number of malnutrition cases were being seen in hospitals, including at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. \\"We have not seen malnutrition for decades and so we are seeing it for the first time in the hospital,\\" she said. * The phasing out of the lockdown in a \\"month-to-month\\" fashion had no basis in science. Many lockdown regulations seemed to be \\"thumb-sucks\\", made up on the spot with little rationale behind them. She told the media: Health minister Zweli Mkhize stated that Gray had \\"made factually incorrect and unfounded statements\\". He pointed out that the government had appointed a research subcommittee to which Gray belongs to advise them. He said that the thumb-suck comment \\"undermines the joint work and effort that the National Coronavirus Command Council, Cabinet and government as a whole have been engaged in.\\" With regard to the comment on schooling he said: \\"The Department of Basic Education has been engaged in various consultations with its stakeholders on the correct approach to take in the process of opening schools.\\" Subsequent to Mkhize's comments, the acting director general of the Department of Health, Anban Pillay, said that an investigation into Gray's conduct was needed. On 25 May 2020, the South African Medical Research Council apologised for Gray's statements and barred its staff from speaking to the media while more than 250 academics issued statements of support for her. On the following day, 26 May 2020, Mkhize said that he \\"considers the Professor Glenda Gray matter closed\\", and he mentioned that \\"there is no basis to suggest any interference with academic freedom\\".

It had a theatrical release on 15 October 2014 in France, before having a limited theatrical release on 24 July 2015 in the United States. Plot Samba Ciss√© (Omar Sy), a migrant from Senegal to France, works as a dish washer in a hotel. After a bureaucratic slip-up lands him in a detention, he is ordered to leave France.

Anterior fins beginning below the ventral ganglion. Alimentary diverticula present. Eyes with small, round pigment spot. Ovaries long and narrow. Seminal vesicles conical in shape, either exactly next to or very close to the tail fin, separated from posterior fins. For anatomy, reproduction, classification, and fossil record; see Chaetognatha Taxonomy Three subspecies are recognised - Sagitta elegans arctica, Sagitta elegans baltica and Sagitta elegans elegans. The subspecies are considered to vary in size depending on the temperature of the waters in which they develop, which could be an indication of them being synonymous species. The numbers of hooks and teeth vary slightly in the three subspecies. Ecology =General= With exception for the benthic species Spadella, arrow worms are all adapted for planktonic existence. They swim to the surface at night, and descend during daytime. Most of the time they drift passively, but they can dart forward in swift spurts, using their caudal fin and longitudinal muscles. Horizontal fins bordering the trunk serve largely as stabilizers, and are used in flotation rather than in active swimming. =Distribution= Parasagitta elegans and the three subspecies occur in Arctic and subarctic waters. S. elegans elegans is a coastal subspecies with oceanic influence. S. elegans arctica is a boreal-arctic form, and S. elegans baltica is the smallest form, found only in or near the Baltic Sea.

He was born at Castlebellingham, County Louth, Ireland and died at Wimbledon, London. Biography Macan was educated at Harrow School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. As a cricketer, Macan was a right-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler, though he did not bowl in first-class cricket. He played in a single match for Cambridge University in 1872, and then reappeared fairly regularly in 1873, scoring 57 against an \\"England XI\\" which was a rather pale shadow of the All- England cricket teams that played as \\"England\\" in the period before international cricket began; the 57 was his highest first-class score, but he was unsuccessful in other matches and was not picked for the 1873 University Match against Oxford University. In one match, he played for \\"the Gentlemen of England\\" against the university side. Though he failed to pass 50 again, he was more consistently successful in both 1874 and 1875 and played in the University Match in both seasons. In 1874, he made 6 and 12 as a poor Cambridge batting side was overwhelmed by an innings and 92 runs; in 1875, he made 2 and 1 not out as Cambridge lost by just six runs. He played no further first-class cricket after leaving Cambridge, but is recorded in non-first- class scorecards from Marylebone Cricket Club and other amateur sides up to 1890. Macan graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1875 and then qualified as a lawyer, being called to the bar in 1877. He did not practise as a barrister, but instead acted as a court reporter, working for the Law Times Reports in the Chancery Division.

British Sea Spiders. Synopses of the British Fauna (New Series), 5. Morphology Early life stage morphology White, translucent or reddish, occasionally with violet bands. Slender body (2.5-3.0 mm) and legs that are three and a half times as long. The proboscis is relatively short. The abdomen is thick, and the thoracic segments are broader than long. The palps have five joints. The propodus is longer than the tarsus, which is covered with numerous short spines and three longer ones near the heel. Later life stage morphology Morphological characteristics very similar to earlier life stages. Reddish or white. Smooth and slender body (4-5mm) and legs four times this. The cephalon is broad, and the abdomen is relatively short. Male specimens carry the eggs on specially designed appendages (2). Habitat The species inhabits the littoral and sublittoral zone to a depth of 60m and occurs amongst hydroids. Its distribution ranges from the Arctic to at least south of Great Britain, and is widely distributed in both The North Sea and The Baltic Sea (2, 3). In The Baltic Sea, this species has been found around Elsinor in Denmark in depths of ~37m amongst dense populations of the hydroids Abietinaria abietina, Alcyonium digitatum and various other hydroids.http://www.seawater.no/fauna/arthropoda/gracile.html Diet Feeds on e.g. coelenterate species (2,3).

It remained the de facto system of governance for 65 years, until it was abolished on 4 June 1832 by D. Peter IV, but by 1828 its de jure status had made it nonoperational, owing to the revolutionary movements that lead to the Liberal Wars. The creation of the Captaincy-General was part of the Pombaline reforms to the Portuguese administration, during the reign of Joseph I, under the initiatives of Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, the Marquess of Pombal, then prime minister. A Captaincy-General operated from the Palace of the Captains-General, under the direction of the titular Captain-General, who operated as the Governor of the Azores, with additional jurisdiction on every island of the Azorean archipelago. The Captaincy-General was succeeded by the Province of the Azores, an ephemeral administrative structure that was collapse in the immediate years. History The settlement of the Azores coalesced in the second half of the 15th century, in a late medieval context, that translated into the establishment of a governing structure based on the signeur system. Effective governorship of each island was confided in a donatary, and his subordinates, the donatary-captains, resulting in a patchwork of development. Living far from direct power, the donatary-captains functioned with individual vice-regal rights, that allowed them to operate as local kings.Carlos Melo Bento (2003), p.70 But, parallel with this system, evolved the traditional Portuguese municipal model, wherein the islands were structured into municipalities, where the municipal organs assumed a great deal of the local governance.Within the 15th century, during the donatary regime, the municipalities of Vila do Porto, Vila Franca do Campo, Angra, Praia, Horta, Santa Cruz da Graciosa, Velas and Lajes do Pico. On the island of Flores, under a signeur, during the first half of the 16th century, the municipalities of Lajes (1515) and Santa Cruz (1548) were established. With the end of the Donatary system, the King created the municipalities of Ponta Delgada, in 1499; S√£o Sebasti√£o, in 1503; Ribeira Grande, em 1507; Topo, in 1510; Nordeste, in 1514; √Ågua de Pau, in 1515; Lagoa, in 1522; Calheta de S√£o Jorge, in 1534; S√£o Roque do Pico, in 1542; and Praia da Graciosa, in 1546. The municipalities of Madalena do Pico, created in 1723, and Vila do Corvo, created in 1832, completed the restructuring of the municipalities of the Azores, and the historical municipality of Capelas (that existed between 1839 and 1855) was abolished. Royal power, until this time was represented in the Corregedor,Between 1534 and 1544, there were two corregedores: one for the islands of S√£o Miguel and Santa Maria; and other for the remaining islands. that traveled between the islands correcting, verifying and resolving issues associated with municipal laws and conflicts with the Donatary-captains. Spiritual power, was bestowed in the Order of Christ, and later in the Archdiocese of Funchal, before passing to the Bishopric of Angra after 1534. With the ascension of King Manuel I, who was donatary of the islands,It is unclear whether the statue applied to the islands of Flores and Corvo, which was then under the signeurial powers, and outside the donatary system. the donatary possessions were integrated into Crown possessions, resulting in a clear delineation of Royal and donatary powers. This alteration had an important effect on the islands, since the functions of the donatary captains were transferred, without exception, from resident officials on the islands to members of the high nobility resident in Portugal, who were represented locally by Ouvidores. The distancing of the Donatary-captainsExcept on the island of S√£o Miguel, where the Gon√ßalves da C√¢mara family, the Counts of Ribeira Grande, maintained their privileges through strategic marriages and power-plays. meant that the renting of lands to serfs no longer occurred, since all land remained the property of the Crown, through its assigned representatives: land distribution on the islands was essentially complete. This process essentially transferred feudal power to the aristocracy, who received 10% of the land rents and had little to no influence on local governance. The abolish of the Donatary-captains, an institution imposed due to the irregularity of the maritime communication, meant that power shifted to the municipal authorities, moderated by the interventions of the Corregedor. This resulted in increased local autonomy, with each municipality obtaining an independence based on distance from Royal or signeurial power, with any influence resulting from their proximity to other islands or local municipalities. This level of autonomy was interrupted by the Spanish conquest of the islands, under Phillip II of Spain, who placed their governance in the hands of his Military Governor in Angra. The concentration of administrative power in Angra during this period meant that, following the Portuguese Restoration War, the Crown made obliged to provide assurances to local politicians that the Azores would not function as a Vice-Regal fiefdom in the future. This guarantee was obtained during the Lisbon Cortes of 1645‚Äì1646, and the islands returned to its former administration for the preceding century. The initiation of the Pombaline reforms were, therefore, anachronistic and contrary to the enlightened and centralizing spirit that inspired those policies. A reflection of a centralized and authoritarian system developing from the Pombaline reforms, although fundamentally a military institution, the jurisdiction of the Captaincy-General encompassed the civil administration, justice and economic sectors, conferring Vice-Royal status and series of powers that permitted the control of the public administration, including municipal institutions. The creation of the Captaincy-General marked the end of signeurial power on the islands, then embodied in the Donatary-captains and their overseers. After 65 years of functioning and various events, the Captaincy-General was abolished under decree 28, 4 June 1832, signed in Ponta Delgada by Pedro IV, who created the Province of the Azores, a new administrative structure that collapsed within the immediate years. =Captaincy-General= It is not surprising that the unification of the Azorean government was necessary. The islands had continued subjects to the dominion of the Donatary-captains since the 15th century, even if interrupted by the Spanish Conquest of the Azores. Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, the Marquess of Pombal, ordered a complete change in the governance of the islands, which were put into effect by King Joseph I of Portugal, on 2 August 1766, resulting in the creation of the Captaincy-General of the Azores (a system that already existed in many of the overseas territories of the Portugal and Spain, in the Americas). Owing to being the seat of the only Diocese in the Azores, the city of Angra was selected as the capital of the Azores, and residence of the Captain-General. The political and administrative unification of the archipelago was also a response to the disorder implanted in the public administration, and in particular in the areas of taxation and justice. The preamble of the charter, that created the Captaincy, justified the creation of the new politico-administrative authority only \\"the Terceiras islands, commonly called the Azores, adjacent to these Kingdoms...are a considerable part of them [and] by the kindness of its climate and for its distinct vassals who have their homes in them, so worthy of the same providence, which predecessor kings were masters at political, military and civil governments, to each and every one of the provinces of these kingdoms, and the state of Brazil and more domains overseas, creating in them governors and captains-general.\\" Administration The following were the captains- general installed in following years: # 1766‚Äì1774 - Ant√£o de Almada, 12th Count of Avranches # 1774‚Äì1793 - Dinis Greg√≥rio de Melo Castro e Mendon√ßa # 1793‚Äì1799 - Interim government, presided by Bishop Jos√© da Av√©-Maria Leite da Costa e Silva and the Corregedor of Angra, Manuel Jos√© de Arriaga Brum da Silveira (who was substituted on 23 May 1795 by Lu√≠s de Moura Furtado and on 9 July 1795 by Jos√© Ac√∫rsio das Neves).

In this period the debate on education was usually framed in terms of \\"national education\\" (i.e. universal state education) and its characteristics: fee-paying or free, compulsory or voluntary (and to what age), religious, non-denominational, or secular, inspection. A committee of the Privy Council on national education was set up in 1839. The National Public Schools Association (NPSA), founded 1850, was a significant and prominent English pressure group campaigning for elementary education. It built on strong feelings in favour of education that was independent of the Church of England, centred on Manchester. Those who took part had often been involved in other reforming and radical causes. But no one group can be said to have determined the eventual shape of the 1870 Act.  1830s  At the beginning of the reign of Queen Victoria, state control of the education system was opposed by Anglican churchmen, such as James Shergold Boone. The status quo in England and Wales consisted of the two elementary school systems run by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education (Anglican) and the British and Foreign School Society (non-sectarian). The 1830s saw efforts to change elementary education to a system more effective in educating children in the major industrial cities, in particular. The Central Society for Education of 1836, drawing its ideas from the USA, with its non-religious schools, and Richard Whately's national education pilot in Ireland, had a strong base in parliament. Yet it proved vulnerable to the claim that secular education would disadvantage the poor, and was short-lived. The Manchester Society for promoting National Education (1837) followed the lead of the Central Society, and opened three schools in 1838. It too did not survive long: the government showed no interest in non-sectarian education.  1840s and 1850s  The Lancashire Public Schools Association (LPSA) was founded in 1847, by a group of seven including Alexander Ireland and Samuel Lucas, drawing heavily on Anti-Corn Law League activists; and was dominated by Unitarians. A setpiece debate between William McKerrow and George Osborn on 28 March 1849 in Manchester saw the amendment by Osborn and Hugh Stowell to an Association petition, to ensure a Christian education, carried by a small margin.Samuel Edwin Maltby, Manchester and the movement for national elementary education, 1800-1870 (1918), pp. 71‚Äì2; archive.org In 1850 the LPSA became the National Public Schools Association (NPSA). During the 1850s it campaigned for an education system that was secular or non-sectarian, having financial support from local rates and under political control. Richard Cobden and William Johnson Fox were national leaders of the NPSA, and the educational system of Massachusetts taken as a model. In the mid-1850s, a number of education bills were introduced in parliament, one drafted for the NPSA originating in 1855 with Cobden, Thomas Milner Gibson and Thomas Emerson Headlam. Nothing came of them. At the local level, John Watts in 1852 there was common ground for the NPSA and campaigners against the \\"taxes on knowledge\\".  1860s  Locally, the NPSA in Manchester was followed in 1864 by the Manchester Educational Aid Society, which campaigned for compulsory primary education. It involved particularly McKerrow.  Aftermath  = National Education League (1869) = = National Education Union (1869) = The National Education Union was founded in 1869 also, in reaction to the National Education League. Its support was Anglican, with some Methodists and Roman Catholics.

Background The event was headlined by a Light Heavyweight Championship bout between the champion at that time, Jon Jones, and top contender Daniel Cormier. Jones was initially scheduled to face Alexander Gustafsson in a rematch on September 27, 2014 at UFC 178. However, Gustafsson pulled out of the bout due to a knee injury and was replaced by Daniel Cormier. Subsequently, on August 12, Jones pulled out of the bout against Cormier citing a leg injury, which in turn led to the rescheduling of the pairing to this event. A matchup for the Women's Bantamweight Championship between the champion at the time Ronda Rousey and top contender Cat Zingano was briefly attached to this event. However, it was announced in late October that the pairing was delayed and would take place eight weeks later at UFC 184. Danny Castillo was expected to face Rustam Khabilov, but visa issues forced Khabilov out of the fight. He was replaced by Paul Felder, who was originally scheduled to fight at UFC Fight Night: McGregor vs. Siver. Alexis Dufresne missed weight on her first attempt at the weigh ins, weighing in at 138 pounds. She was given additional time to make the bantamweight limit, but made no attempt to cut further. Instead, she was fined 20 percent of her purse, which went to Marion Reneau. UFC 182 became the second longest UFC event behind UFC 136 with a total in-cage fight time of 154 minutes and 56 seconds. On January 6, it was announced that Jones failed a drug test prior to the event. He tested positive for benzoylecgonine, the primary metabolite of cocaine. As benzoylecgonine is not banned out of competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the NSAC could not halt Jones from fighting at UFC 182. He was randomly tested on December 4 and the results came back on December 23, the NSAC Executive Director Bob Bennett said. Jones immediately entered rehab, though it was later revealed by his mother that he only spent one night in rehab. On February 10, it was announced that Hector Lombard failed a fight night drug test, testing positive for the anabolic steroid desoxymethyltestosterone. The failed drug test was responsible for the cancellation of his bout against Rory MacDonald at UFC 186. On March 23, Lombard was suspended for one year, fined and had his win over Josh Burkman overturned to a no contest by the NSAC. He was fined his original $53,000 win bonus, plus one-third of the rest of his purse, which included $53,000 in show money. In addition, Lombard also must pass a drug test prior to getting relicensed by the NSAC. Results Bonus awards The following fighters were awarded $50,000 bonuses: *Fight of the Night: Jon Jones vs. Daniel Cormier *Performance of the Night: Paul Felder and Shawn Jordan Reported payout The following is the reported payout to the fighters as reported to the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

It was directed by Cho Soo-hyun. The music video was filmed in Seoul for 48 straight hours. The video was premiered on July 15, 2012 and was later made available to download digitally on October 19. In the music video Psy \\"pokes fun at the style of Seoul's Gangnam-gu, a flashy district with high rents, high expectations and a focus on the high-status lifestyle\\". On December 21, 2012, the music video was the first to hit 1 billion views on the video-sharing website YouTube and in June 2014 the video had surpassed 2 billion views. As of July 2020, the video has received over 3.7 billion views. The music video won accolades from various award-giving bodies like Mnet Asian Music Awards and Melon Music Awards. Production The music video is directed by Cho Soo-hyun, who also directed the music video for Psy's follow-up single \\"Gentleman\\" and the music video for \\"This Love\\" by Shinhwa. It shows Psy performing a comical horse-riding dance and appearing in unexpected locations around the Gangnam District, such as an outdoor yoga session and a hot tub. He wears several distinctive suits and black sunglasses with a mindset of \\"dress classy and dance cheesy\\". It features a \\"skewering [of] the Gangnam image\\" by the \\"non-Gangnam Psy\\"; this parody would be recognizable to viewers familiar with Korean culture. Although there are more than ten different locations featured, only two of the scenes are actually filmed in the Gangnam district. The sauna scene, elevator scene and bathroom scene were filmed elsewhere in the greater Seoul region, and some shots were filmed in World Trade Center Seoul and the Songdo International Business District, which includes Songdo Central Park and International Business District Station. The video was shot over 48 hours in July 2012. In K-pop, it is routine to have cameos by celebrities in a music video, such as in the dance scenes in the elevator and the parking garage. The guests in the music video include: * 4Minute member Hyuna, who dances in the subway car and attracts Psy's attention. * Hwang Min-woo, a 7-year-old boy who dances at the beginning of the video. During an interview with CNN, Psy stated that \\"the night before the music video shoot, I was watching Korea's Got Talent and saw him dance to Michael Jackson. His moves were ridiculous. So we called him up and asked him to be in the music video, which was shooting the very next day, and he came and it all worked out.\\" He has been praised for his eye-catching dance moves that have received a lot of attention from viewers. * Comedian/television personality Korea's Nation emcee Yoo Jae-suk, who engages in a dance duel with Psy. * Comedian/television personality Noh Hong-chul, who does his trademark pelvis-thrusting dance in an elevator while Psy raps underneath him. The music was composed by Psy and Yoo Gun-hyung, a producer in South Korea who has also collaborated with Psy in the past. Yoo also arranged the song while Psy was responsible for the lyrics. Synopsis The video starts out with Psy, who is lounging at what looks like a sandy beach, under a sun umbrella and holding a cold drink, but the camera zooms out to reveal he is actually at a playground. The video then alternates between the playground, where a boy (Hwang Min-woo) dances next to him; and a row of horses in stalls, where Psy performs his signature \\"invisible horse dance\\". As Psy (and two girls) walk through a parking garage, they are pelted by pieces of newspaper, trash, and snow. At a sauna, dressed in a blue towel, he rests his head on a fat man's shoulder while another man covered in tattoos is stretching. He then sings in front of two men playing Janggi (Korean chess), dances with a woman at a tennis court and bounces around on a tour bus of seniors. The scenes alternate quickly until there is an explosion near the chess players (portrayed by Big Bang members Seungri and Daesung), causing them to jump off the bench. Psy immediately walks towards the camera, pointing and shouting \\"Oppan Gangnam Style\\". The chorus starts as he and some dancers perform at a horse stable. He dances as two women walk backwards. He dances at the tennis court, a carousel, and the tour bus. He shuffles into an outdoor yoga session and on a boat. The camera zooms in on a woman's buttocks, then shows Psy \\"yelling\\" at it. The chorus ends and he is seen at a parking lot, where Psy is approached by a man (Yoo Jae-suk) in a yellow suit who steps out of a red Mercedes-Benz SLK 200; they have a dance duel. He then appears in an elevator underneath a man (Noh Hong-chul) who is straddling him and thrusting his pelvis. The man in the yellow suit then gets in his car and leaves. The camera pans and it shows Psy in the subway station, where he boards the train and notices an attractive young woman (Hyuna) dancing. At one of the train stops, he approaches the girl in slow motion, and she does the same. They start to embrace. He then tells the girl \\"Oppan Gangnam Style\\", and they horse dance along with some others at the train station, commencing the second chorus. He also surfaces from a spa.In the Rolling Stone interview, Psy says he copied the spa surfacing scene from the music video for Lady Gaga's \\"Poker Face\\". Psy sings to the girl at a night club as people in various costumes walk behind them. He raps in a serious tone in an enclosed space, but when he says \\"You know what I'm saying\\" the camera zooms out, and it is revealed that he is actually sitting on a toilet with his pants down. Psy and a large group of dancers do the horse dance and strike a final pose. After a brief reprise of the dance duel, Psy says, \\"Oppan Gangnam style\\", and the video finishes with a cartoon graphic. Popularity Colegio de la Preciosa Sangre (Pichilemu, Chile) Following its July 15 release, \\"Gangnam Style\\" overtook Carly Rae Jepsen's \\"Call Me Maybe\\" to reach the number one position on the YouTube Top 100 Music Videos during the week of August 28, 2012. On September 1, it overtook Girls' Generation's \\"Gee\\" to become the most viewed K-pop video on YouTube. Although \\"Call Me Maybe\\" has had unusually strong staying power, averaging over 1.5 million views each day, \\"Gangnam Style\\" increased to an average of over nine million views per day within just two months. This is mainly because \\"Call Me Maybe\\" remained largely a North American trend, whereas the popularity of \\"Gangnam Style\\" is not confined to the United States. Sixty-two percent of viewers were male, and those aged between 13 and 17 represented the biggest group. According to The Wall Street Journal, T-Pain was among the first to have \\"sent [the video] to the stratosphere\\" when he tweeted about it on July 29. It was then picked up by Neetzan Zimmerman from the social blog Gawker, who asked \\"Did this underground Hip Hop artist from South Korea just release the Best Music Video of the Year?\\" on July 30. This was soon followed by Robbie Williams, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Tom Cruise, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and William Gibson, who have either commented about or shared the video with their fans via Twitter. The earliest video to catch the attention of media networks outside South Korea was \\"Psy Gangnam Style MV Reaction\\", which was uploaded by Katie and Mindy Anderson on July 18, 2012. The Andersons were subsequently interviewed by Evan Ramstad from The Wall Street Journal a few weeks later. In his article published on August 6, 2012, Ramstad also included \\"Kpop Music Mondays : PSY Gangnam Style\\", a review and parody of \\"Gangnam Style\\" uploaded on July 23 by K-pop video bloggers Simon and Martina Stawski, a Canadian couple living in Seoul. This makes the Stawski's video the earliest parody featured in an American newspaper. On August 8, 2012, Ramstad appeared on WSJ Live, and he mentioned the Andersons and the Stawskis again, before claiming that \\"a lot of Koreans are also making their own parodies of 'Gangnam Style'\\". On September 3, 2012, the number of daily views generated by \\"Gangnam Style\\" went past the five-million mark. By the end of September, it had topped the iTunes charts in 31 countries. 1 Earliest notable reaction video by K-pop fans Katie and Mindy Anderson, uploaded to YouTube on July 18, 2012 2 Earliest notable parody by K-pop bloggers Simon and Martina Stawski, uploaded on July 23 3a Shared on the social news website Reddit, July 28 3b Earliest celebrity comment by Robbie Williams on his personal blog, July 28 3c Featured in the foreign tabloid newspaper Ilta-Sanomat, in Finland, July 28 4 First celebrity tweet by T-Pain, July 29 5 Picked up by Neetzan Zimmerman from the social blog Gawker, July 30 6 Picked up by the British political commentator Andrew Sullivan, who blogs about the video on The Daily Beast, August 1 7 Featured in CNN International and The Wall Street Journal, August 3 8 Nelly Furtado performs \\"Gangnam Style\\" at her concert in the Philippines, August 16 9 Psy performs \\"Gangnam Style\\" at Dodger Stadium, August 20.

This marks his first appearance in a US television show \\"Gangnam Style\\" reached the unprecedented milestone of one billion YouTube views on December 21, 2012. A spoof documentary by videographer Simon Gosselin was posted on YouTube and had promoted 2012 doomsday rumors across social media services such as Facebook and Twitter that linked \\"Gangnam Style\\" to a fake Nostradamus prophecy. On December 21, at around 15:50 UTC, the video's YouTube page updated with 1,000,382,639 views. YouTube specially marked the video's accomplishments with a cartoon dancing Psy animated icon, added first by the site logo, and later next to the video's view counter when it exceeded a billion views. On April 6, 2013 the video on YouTube reached 1.5 billion views. On June 1, 2014, the music video reached two billion views. On December 3, 2014, the video reached 2.1 billion views (close to the largest representable number in a 32-bit binary number), and YouTube jokingly wrote on Google+ that it had to change the view counting system to prevent an integer overflow. In fact, YouTube had already updated to a 64-bit integer months before. On January 19, 2016, the video reached 2.5 billion views. On November 25, 2017, the video surpassed 3 billion views. According to a research by E√∂tv√∂s University and Ericsson Research in Hungary; and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, the geographical source of the viral spread of the video is the Philippines and not in South Korea where the video was produced. The researchers concluded the origin of the viral spread after analyzing data in Twitter and verifying the spreading pattern through Google Trends. =Records= The video has held five records in YouTube history - most viewed video (held for 1,689 days; surpassed on July 10, 2017 by Wiz Khalifa's \\"See You Again\\"), most rated video (surpassed on February 19, 2017 by \\"See You Again\\"), most discussed video (current), most liked video (held for 1,444 days; surpassed on August 27, 2016 by \\"See You Again\\"), and fastest video to reach 1 billion views (surpassed on January 18, 2016 by Adele's \\"Hello\\") =View count= ‚Ññ 1 Most Viewed Video (Jan 2012 - Feb 2018) Reception The music video of \\"Gangnam Style\\" has been met with positive responses from the music industry and commentators, who drew attention to its tone and dance moves, though some found them vulgar. Another notable aspect that helped popularise the video was its comical dance moves that can be easily copied, such as the pelvic thrust during the elevator scene. The United Nations hailed Psy as an \\"international sensation\\" because of the popularity of his \\"satirical\\" video clip and its \\"horse-riding-like dance moves\\". As such, the music video spawned a dance craze unseen since the Macarena of the mid-1990s. The World Bank's lead economist David McKenzie remarked that some of Psy‚Äôs dance moves \\"kind of look like a regression discontinuity\\", while the space agency NASA called \\"Gangnam Style\\" a dance-filled music video that has forever entered the hearts and minds of millions of people. Melissa Locker of Time noted that \\"it's hard not to watch again ...and again ...and again\\", while CNN reporter Shanon Cook told the audience that she had watched \\"Gangnam Style\\" about 15 times. The German news magazine Der Spiegel attributed the popularity of \\"Gangnam Style\\" to its daring dance moves, a sentiment similarly voiced by Maura Judkis of The Washington Post, who wrote, \\"'Gangnam Style' has made an extraordinarily stupid-looking dance move suddenly cool\\". The video was also positively reviewed by Steve Knopper from Rolling Stone, who called \\"Gangnam Style\\" an astoundingly great K-pop video that has all the best elements of hypnotically weird one-hit wonders and hopes that \\"PSY gets filthy rich from this\\". Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press wrote that Psy's dance moves are \\"somewhat bizarre\\" but the music video is full of colorful, lively outfits. Matt Buchanan and Scott Ellis of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the video \\"makes no sense at all to most Western eyes\\" and it \\"makes you wonder if you have accidentally taken someone else's medication\\" whereas Deborah Netburn of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"one of the greatest videos ever to be uploaded to YouTube.\\" As of January 2015, Billboard named the video as one of the 20 best music videos of the 2010s (so far).

A rational agent should choose actions whose outcomes, when weighed by their probability, have higher utility. But some very unlikely outcomes may have very great utilities, and these utilities can grow faster than the probability diminishes. Hence the agent should focus more on vastly improbable cases with implausibly high rewards; this leads first to counter-intuitive choices, and then to incoherence as the utility of every choice becomes unbounded. The name refers to Pascal's Wager, but unlike the wager, it does not require infinite rewards. This sidesteps many objections to the Pascal's Wager dilemma that are based on the nature of infinity. Problem statement In one description, Blaise Pascal is accosted by a mugger who has forgotten his weapon. However, the mugger proposes a deal: the philosopher gives him his wallet, and in exchange the mugger will return twice the amount of money tomorrow. Pascal declines, pointing out that it is unlikely the deal will be honoured. The mugger then continues naming higher rewards, pointing out that even if it is just one chance in 1000 that he will be honourable, it would make sense for Pascal to make a deal for a 2000 times return. Pascal responds that the probability for that high return is even lower than one in 1000. The mugger argues back that for any low probability of being able to pay back a large amount of money (or pure utility) there exists a finite amount that makes it rational to take the bet ‚Äì and given human fallibility and philosophical scepticism a rational person must admit there is at least some non-zero chance that such a deal would be possible. In one example, the mugger succeeds by promising Pascal 1,000 quadrillion happy days of life. Convinced by the argument, Pascal gives the mugger the wallet. The term \\"Pascal's mugging\\" to refer to this problem was originally coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky in the Less Wrong forum.Eliezer Yudkowsky, Pascal's Mugging: Tiny Probabilities of Vast Utilities. Less Wrong, 19 October 2007. http://lesswrong.com/lw/kd/pascals_mugging_tiny_probabilities_of_vast/ In one of Yudkowsky's examples, the mugger succeeds by saying \\"give me five dollars, or I'll use my magic powers from outside the Matrix to run a Turing machine that simulates and kills 3\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow3 people\\". Here, the number 3\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow3 uses Knuth's up-arrow notation; writing the number out in base 10 would require enormously more writing material than there are atoms in the known universe. Moreover, in many reasonable-seeming decision systems, \\"Pascal's mugging\\" causes the expected utility of any action to fail to converge, as an unlimited chain of successively dire scenarios similar to Pascal's mugging would need to be factored in.Kieran Marray, Dealing With Uncertainty in Ethical Calculations of Existential Risk, Presented at The Economic and Social Research Council Climate Ethics and Climate Economics Workshop Series: Workshop Five - Risk and the Culture of Science, May 2016 http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/climateethicseconomics/documents/papers- workshop-5/marray.pdf Consequences and remedies Philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that Pascal's mugging, like Pascal's wager, suggests that giving a superintelligent artificial intelligence a flawed decision theory could be disastrous. \\"Decision Theory\\" section. Pascal's mugging may also be relevant when considering low-probability, high-stakes events such as existential risk or charitable interventions with a low probability of success but extremely high rewards. Common sense seems to suggest that spending effort on too unlikely scenarios is irrational. One advocated remedy might be to only use bounded utility functions: rewards cannot be arbitrarily large.De Blanc, Peter. Convergence of Expected Utilities with Algorithmic Probability Distributions (2007), Another approach is to use Bayesian reasoning to (qualitatively) judge the quality of evidence and probability estimates rather than naively calculate expectations.Holden Karnofsky, Why We Can‚Äôt Take Expected Value Estimates Literally (Even When They‚Äôre Unbiased). GiveWell Blog August 18, 2011 http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected- value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/ Other approaches are to penalize the prior probability of hypotheses that argue that we are in a surprisingly unique position to affect large numbers of other people who cannot symmetrically affect us, reject the providing the probability of a payout first, or abandon quantitative decision procedures in the presence of extremely large risks.

Later the boat operated on Coos Bay, and, in the mid-1930s, was transferred to Eureka, California. Wolverine is principally known for its early service as a high-speed passenger vessel. Design and construction Wolverine was built in Marshfield, Oregon in 1908 at the boatyard of Max Timmerman.‚ÄùGasoline Launch Wolverine, Now On Coquille River Run, and Young Woman Who Christened Her‚Äù, (Date line: Marshfield, Or.

The original owners of were Capt. Orsan R. \\"Ott\\" Willard and Capt. E.D. Stuller, who were also to operate the boat themselves. Willard had commanded the steamboat Antelope when that vessel was operating as a fishing tender on the Coquille River in 1906. The plans for Wolverine showed the boat to be (or ) long, with a beam of feet. and depth of hold of . Officially the dimensions of the boat turned out somewhat different. In 1911, the registered measurements for Wolverine were long, beam, and depth of hold. U.S. Treasury Dept., Statistics Bureau, Annual List of Merchant Vessels (for year ending June 30, 1911), at page 324. Wolverine was 14 gross and 10 net tons in overall size. Passenger capacity was reported to be 75. Total required crew was only one. Power was to be supplied by a 50-horsepower Wolverine engine, which was reported to have been able to drive the boat at \\"a speed far beyond anything ever turned out on Coos Bay\\", or according to another report, 15 miles per hour.\\"Splashes and Splurges\\", Motor Boat, Vol. 5 (1908), page 44, col. 2.

Launch and delivery Marshfield, prior to launch Wolverine was launched late in the afternoon of April 2, 1908.\\"Launch New Boat\\", Coos Bay Times, April 3, 1908, page 3, col. 5. The boat was christened at its launching by Miss Mary Peterson, of Marshfield. With the boat having been built in Coos Bay, it was necessary to take it out into the open ocean to the Coquille River to be placed into service, which \\"attracted much attention, as it was built for river rather than open sea work.\\" On April 22, 1908, Wolverine ran from Empire, Oregon south down the coast to Bandon in about 2.5 hours, much better time than had been expected.\\"Wolverine makes fast run from Bay to Bandon ‚Äì New Boat Covers Distance between Empire and City by the Sea in about Two Hours and a Half\\", Coos Bay Times, April 23, 1908, page 1, col. 5. A number of Marshfield men were taken on the trip, including Mayor Straw. Wolverine departed Empire at 5:20 pm. The seas were reported to have been heavy. Wolverine safely passed both the Coos Bay and Coquille River bars, and arrived in Bandon at about 8:00 p.m. Hundreds of people came to the Bandon docks to see the arrival of the new vessel and greet the people from Coos Bay. One of the passengers found a telephone station in Bandon and placed a telephone call back to Marshfield to report the boat's arrival. Operations Favorite visible on right. Once in service, Wolverine met the morning train from Marshfield at Coquille City. Wolverine made the river trip from Coquille City to Bandon in two hours, making a substantial improvement in the overall traveling time from Marshfield to Bandon, which had previously taken an entire day. The improved service was expected to greatly benefit the business interests of Bandon and also the smaller inland towns. In January 1909, Wolverine was described as a \\"popular\\" boat. The distance on the river from Bandon to Coquille City was 26 miles.Advertisement, \\"The Success of the Wolverine Engine Abroad‚Äù, The Rudder, Vol. 23 (1910), page 36. (publishing a letter dated April 30, 1910 from O.R. Willard.) In April 1910, Wolverine made one round-trip per day on this route, for a total of 52 river miles travelled daily. On February 9, 1913, it was reported that Wolverine and the steamboat Coquille carried about one-half of the passengers traveling between Coquille City and Bandon.\\"Grown of City Bandon Keeps Steady and Atmosphere of Prosperity is Prevalent\\", The Sunday Oregonian, February 9, 1908, page 14, col. 2. The other four vessels then operating on the river accounted for the rest. From June 1912 to January 1, 1913, Wolverine carried 13,000 passengers, compared with Coquille 21,000 (about 100 per trip) during the same period. In January 1913, there were four vessels operating on the Coquille River that transported both passengers and freight.\\"Better Transportation Service Makes Bandon Travelers' Mecca\\", Sunday Oregonian, January 26, 1913, section three, page 10, col. 1. Of these, two ran from Bandon to Myrtle Point and the other two covered only the route from Bandon to Coquille. In addition, there were two passenger-only boats operating on the river between Bandon and Coquille. These were the steamer Coquille and the motor vessel Wolverine. Ownership changes Capt. Orsan R. Willard, photo published January 1913 In July 1908, Orsan R. Willard bought out the one-half interest of E.D.

Collisions with Coquille On the Saturday before January 19, 1909, the steamer Coquille collided with Wolverine.\\"Briefs of Bandon - News of City-by- Sea as Recorded in the Recorder\\", January 19, 1909, page 4, col. 1. Wolverine pulled up to the landing at Rocky Point to pick up some passengers. Coquille, a boat owned by the competing Coquille River Transportation Company, was closely following Wolverine and became caught in the river current, causing Coquille to butt into Wolverine before Captain White, of Coquille, could regain control of his vessel. Wolverine was badly damaged, but the full extent could not be estimated until boat could be evaluated, which the two companies concerned agreed to settle by arbitration. On September 16, 1909, there was a second collision between Coquille and Wolverine, this time at Johnson's Mill.U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service, Annual Report of the Supervising Inspector General to the Secretary of Commerce, Vol. 15 (1910), at page 271.\\"Charges Filed Against Capt. Panter\\", Morning Oregonian, October 5, 1909, page 16, col. 4. Capt. W.T. Panter had been in charge of Coquille at the time of the collision. Capt. O.R. Willard was in charge of Wolverine.‚ÄùWill Probe Boat Trouble ‚Äî United States Inspectors to Investigate Coos Bay and Coquille Collisions‚Äù (Dateline: Portland, OR Oct. 18), Coos Bay Times, October 18, 1909, page 1, col. 3. No damage was sustained by either vessel. However, by October 5, 1909, Orsan R. Willard, owner of Wolverine, had filed a charge with the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service against T.R. Panter, owner of the river steamer Coquille to the effect that while Wolverine had been docked, Panter had deliberately rammed Coquille into Wolverine. Several affidavits from passengers on the Wolverine were included with the charges. On or before October 18, 1909, two steamboat inspectors and a secretary had departed Portland, Oregon, bound by steamer to the Coos Bay region to investigate, among other things, the collision of September 16, 1909, between Wolverine and Coquille, and the charges that had been brought.‚ÄùCaptain Edwards Blamed‚Äù, (Dateline; Marshfield, OR Oct 23) Sunday Oregonian, October 24, 1909, page 7, col. 1. The hearing on the Willard accusation was scheduled to be held on October 23, 1909 in Coquille, Oregon. On October 28, 1909, the Steamboat Inspection Service announced its decision. The license of Orsan R. Willard, master of Wolverine, would be suspended for 30 days, and the license of Thomas W. Panter, master of Coquille, would be suspended for 60 days. Accidents In November 1909, Captain Willard was keeping Wolverine tied to a floating log boom on his place on the Coquille River.\\"News of Coquille\\", Coos Bay Times, November 29, 1909, page 4, col. 1. The previous Monday night the river rose rapidly in what was called a \\"freshet\\". A log raft came down the river and somehow jammed into Wolverine and tore off the vessel's propeller. On February 21, 1910, it was reported that in a driving rain Wolverine collided with a smaller gasoline boat that was occupied by a Coquille physician, but due to the maneuvering of Captain Willard at the wheel, Wolverine barely struck the smaller boat, so the damage was much less and no one was hurt.\\"Culin's Boat Smashed -- Coquille Physician in Collision on the Coquille River\\", Coos Bay Times, February 21, 1910, page 4, col. 2.  Further charges against owners In 1915, another Willard-operated boat, Dora came into fierce competition with the gasoline launch Charm run by the Panters. In January 1915, there was a collision between Dora and Charm, and the captains of the vessels, O.R. Willard, of Dora, and Allen Panter, of Charm, each claimed the collision was the other's fault.\\"Steamboat Controversy May Be Brought to Head\\", Semi-weekly Bandon Recorder, January 29, 1915, page 1, col. 6. Following the collision, the crews of the two vessels exchanged intemperate words, and someone was said to have thrown a gaspipe through a window on one of the vessels, while it was also claimed that someone had heaved a can of coal oil at the Dora. Someone concerned about passenger safety contacted Sheriff Johnson, who in turn referred the matter to the Steamboat Inspection Service. The inspectors instructed captains Willard and Panter to each submit written reports of the incident. On February 3, 1915, following a two-day trial before inspectors Edwards and Fuller, the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service suspended, for 20 months each, the licenses of Captains Walter Panter and Allen Panter, as well as that of engineer William Panter, all of the Myrtle Point Transportation Company, as well as the licenses of Capt. O. R. Willard and engineer Elmer Willard, both of the Coquille River Company.\\"Riverboat Men Get Vacations\\", Bandon Recorder, February 5, 1915, page 1, col. 6. Both the Panters and the Willards were barred from operating any vessel on the Coquille River or anywhere else. Later years On July 13, 1915, it was announced that Captain Willard had sold his interest in the Coquille River Transportation Company and would refit Wolverine as the nucleus of another steamboat line.Bandon Recorder, July 13, 1915, at page 6, col. 3. However, the next day, in another newspaper, it was reported that a Captain Lloyd \\"will run the gasoline boat Wolverine built on Coos Bay and run for a long time by Captain Willard on the passenger run between Coquille and Bandon.\\"\\"Operate Fish Boat\\", Coos Bay Times, June 14, 1915, page 5, col. 3. The newspaper also stated that Wolverine \\"is to be taken south and will be remodeled.\\" By August 1915, Wolverine had been inactive for two years.\\"Coquille River Trade Keeps Craft Bustling\\", Sunday Oregonian, August 22, 1915, section 4, page 43, col. 5. There had been an announcement on June 29, 1915, that Wolverine had been sold and would be transferred to California for use on the Sacramento River.Bandon Recorder, June 29, 1915, at page 5, col. 4. (describing Wolverine as a \\"steamer\\"). However, not long later, on July 13, 1915, there was another announcement that Wolverine was to be operated independently by Captain Willard.

It was founded in 2010 by a number of industry professionals to form a trade association focused on education, networking, and standards development. The purposes of the DSF are to support and promote the common business interests of the interactive technologies industry, the digital signage industry, and the digital out-of-home network industry (DOOH). The DSF was formed in March 2010 and officially incorporated on May 12, 2010. Since its incorporation, the DSF has supported the research of, and improved legislation, regulation, code and standards that affect the sale and use of, digital signage and other products and services within the Association Industries (digital signage, interactive technologies, and DOOH). Its current structure includes an Executive committee formed by a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasurer/Secretary, and Immediate Past Chairman; and a rotating Board of At- Large Directors composed of 14 industry professionals.  History  The DSF was formed by a number of industry professionals to form a trade association focused on education, networking, and standards development. The group of individuals who started the organization came from attendees and exhibitors of the \\"Digital Signage Expo\\" (DSE) trade show in 2010. The initial group of leaders was appointed and membership was free for the first year. The DSE and the DSF created a funding agreement and the DSF recognized the DSE as its official industry trade show. Also in 2010, the board adopted the Digital Signage Experts Group certification program as its official certification and received discounts for members. The DSF also held its first election of board members. The original structure of the DSF was that there were independent governing councils based on industry sector. These \\"mini-associations\\" were to appoint representatives to the board. In essence, it was a federation of interest groups, hence the name. In 2011 the association adopted new bylaws that removed the industry sector groups and formed an official singular governing board. Additionally, the DSF began to do outreach to specific industry sectors and formed new education initiatives. The legacy left by the then-Chairman Bob Stowe was the development of the organization's structure. In 2012 the DSF adopted a glossary of terms and a new Education Standard to guide the formation of education programs at colleges in the medium of digital signage. The legacy of Chairman Alan Brawn was the development of the education activities of the association. It was decided that DSF's board would meet quarterly instead of monthly. Board meetings use a modified Robert's Rules of Order. In 2013 the DSF started regional networking events, more industry vertical outreach, increased its webcasts, and hosted its first DSF In-Forum, an event to provide end users with a business tool to freely and easily source Request for proposal (RFPs) for their projects. The legacy of Chairman Philip M. Cohen was the establishment of the networking meetings and increased membership. In May 2014, the organization's membership count surpassed the 500-milestone. In February 2016, the DSF announced that OVAB Europe would become an independent affiliate of the DSF, and that it would change its name to DSF Europe. DSF Europe has kept control of its own budget and annual agenda, and has a seat on the DSF Board of Directors. Activities Since its incorporation, the DSF has hosted a number of projects and initiatives with the aim to support research in, and to improve legislation, regulations, code and standards that affect the sale and use of, digital signage and other products and services within the interactive technologies industry, and the DOOH industry. It has established Privacy Standards that have since been cited in national publications and before Congress;. The DSF has provided monthly educational opportunities in a variety of formats to facilitate learning opportunities, whitepapers and case studies important to the industry. Some of the initial activities of the association included a member directory, online topical webinars, adoption of an industry privacy standard, and recognition of college affiliated chapters. The DSF has established Regional Networking Events, attended various industry shows, and provided industry research. The DSF is governed by a Board of Directors, a volunteer member board that is elected by the DSF membership in an annual election. The board consists of an Executive Committee - Chairman, Vice- Chairman, Treasurer/Secretary, and Immediate Past Chairman, all of whom serve one-year terms in their roles. The At-Large Directors are elected to two-year terms on a rotating basis, so that there are four or five directors each year who rotate on/off the board. Certification The Digital Signage Federation, the Digital Signage Expo and numerous manufacturers, distributors, Sellers, and end users have partnered with the Digital Signage Experts Group (DSEG) to bring a comprehensive set of certification programs to the digital signage industry. These courses are designed to bring an individual the education they need, from a fundamental level, to in depth technical training in critical areas of digital signage. These certification programs are administered by an independent industry organization and advisory board, to bring a clear educational message and industry recognition for professional achievement. The Digital Signage Federation has adopted the Digital Signage Experts Group (DSEG) industry certifications for inclusion in the DSF's efforts to establish industry standards, promote professionalism, and provide continuity of education for the digital signage industry. In addition, the DSEG is providing DSF members discounts on these programs.

He is a professional art advisor and consultant at Montefiore Auction House, Tel Aviv and MacDougall's Fine Art Auctions, London. Gildor resides, works, and creates in Tel Aviv.  Biography Jacob-Yosef Gildengorin was born in the German town of Feuchtwangen. His parents were Holocaust survivors who met after the war. Both were the sole survivors of their families. In 1948 the Gildengorin family immigrated to Israel after the birth of their first son, Jacob. They initially settled in Tel Aviv and later on moved to Holon. A year later, his brother, Michael, was born. The children were given a secular education and were raised in a house where work and education were of the highest priorities. The parents' horrific past no longer existed, and it was never discussed in the presence of the children. Nevertheless, in the daily routine there were many references to their being second generation Holocaust survivors. The family moved to the center of Holon and later bought a caf√© in Tel Aviv, \\"Caf√© Atara\\". A few years later they invested in a caf√© and bakery on Yefet Street in Jaffa which was considered at that time an area of crime, drugs, and prostitution. It was in this caf√© that Jacob started his drawing and painting career. In 1962, at the age of 14, Jaffa's colorful characters sitting in his father's caf√© were his inspiration. Jacob completed his high school education at the age of 17 and had one year left before military enrollment. He applied to the Bezalel Academy of Art in Jerusalem and was accepted and placed in the second year. However, deciding to take a different route, Jacob chose to start law studies in Tel Aviv University. He continued his studies while serving as a combat paramedic in 669, the IDF's Airborne Rescue and Evacuation Unit. He finished his law studies at 1971 and worked as a lawyer for 14 years in \\"Ha'Sneh\\" company. The turning point arrived at the age of 40 when he retired from his work and decided to devote his time to art. His first solo exhibition of paper work, drawings, and monotypes was held in 1968 in Bet Hachayal in Tel Aviv under the patronage of the IDF's Chief Education Officer. In 1971 Gildor was invited by the Surrealist artist and teacher Prof. Ernst Fuchs, to Riechenau, a quiet Austrian town in the foothills of the Alps, to learn the master's unique technique in tempera. A close friendship was made between the teacher and student which opened the young artist to the Surrealist movement. In 1987 Gildor spent a year in Cite des Arts in Paris under an Israeli scholarship. Throughout the years Gildor exhibited in many galleries in Israel, Sweden, Germany and France. In 2009, a major comprehensive retrospective exhibition, \\"Segments of Creation\\", with Gildor's works throughout four decades, was held in the Museum of Israeli Art in Ramat-Gan, curated by the Museum Director, Meir Aharonson. The exhibition was displayed for six months and accompanied by a three part complete monography. Gildor is married to Hava Zeilingold. The couple has three sons: Guy (C.E.O. of Persway, a high tech company from Herzliya), Ofer (Gilden's Art Gallery in London) and Boaz (Ph.D in Biology, from Weizmann Institute of Science, in Rehovot).  The \\"Meshushe\\" Group  In 1980, Gildor was one of the founders of Meshushe (Hexagon) group. The group's goal was to introduce Surrealist art to the Israel art space that was dominated by the abstract and conceptual art movements at the time. The founding group consisted of Gildor and five other surrealists: Baruch Elron, Yoav Shuali, Arie Lamdan, Asher Rodnitzky, and Rachel Timor. The group held 10 exhibitions all around Israel and although they were warmly accepted and admired by the Israeli audience, they never managed to enter the Israeli Canon of Art critiques.  Second Generation  By being the son of two Holocaust survivors, Gildor belonged to a group frequently called \\"The Second Generation\\". The term was coined in the 1980s when children of Holocaust survivors reached the stage of self-awareness and began to shape their identity. Although the \\"second generation\\" did not experience the events, the impact can be seen in their work. Gildor began addressing the issue directly in the 1990s, although hints about the subject can also be found in his earlier work. This topic influenced his art work from 1993 and during the subsequent twenty years.

It was released on January 30, 1988 through Lookout Records on 7-inch vinyl with the catalog number LK 004. After the EP went out of print in 1992, all of the tracks were added to the compilation album The Sound of a New World Being Born in 1998, which is also currently not in print. It is often considered a classic Lookout Records release and as Crimpshrine's strongest recording. Background and recording The group originally formed in 1982 under the name S.A.G. and featured future Operation Ivy frontman Jesse Michaels as the vocalist, Aaron Elliot on guitar and Jeff Ott playing drums. According to Elliot, there was a \\"serious lack of equipment\\" as they only had one drum and 3 strings on the guitar.Sleep, What's That? liner notes. Retrieved 2014-08-23 Once Michaels left the band in 1984, they changed their name to Crimpshrine and went through several different line-ups, which had Ott playing synthesizer and piano at various points. Pete Rypins finally joined in 1986 as the group's permanent bassist and, after recording their first demo in early 1987, were approached by David Hayes to record tracks for the upcoming Maximumrocknroll compilation Turn It Around! in August. Shortly after recording the tracks for the compilation, the group went to Dangerous Rhythm in Oakland, California to record tracks for what would become the Sleep, What's That? EP with producer and engineer Kevin Army. Lyrical themes and song origins \\"In My Mind\\" was written by Ott about subconscious racism, with him stating that people \\"must all strive to recognize and remove these small but very ingrained pieces of intolerance from ourselves\\" in the liner notes. The inspiration for the song came when Ott was on a bus and came across an African-American man lying in the aisle unresponsive after he repeatedly attempted to talk to him. Finding that the man had no pulse, Ott asked the driver call an ambulance, to which he reportedly replied \\"Oh, he's just some black wino who's passed out.\\" After Ott told him to call an ambulance again, he finally did and one showed up soon enough to save the man. The title track was written when, in the spring of 1987, a group of homeless people in Berkeley, California set up the \\"Homeless Liberation Front\\", an organization that made a \\"city of tents\\" in Provo Park which they called Reaganville. Ott liked the idea and decided to help them out by bringing food and watching over the tent while they slept, as they were constantly harassed by police officers and other city officials. After a few weeks, Reaganville was torn down by the police. Ott also drew inspiration for the song from his own experiences with homelessness. \\"Tomorrow\\", the EP's final track, is a song about sarcastic hope and originally began as an instrumental from the group's formative years. According to Elliot, it was the only song written during that period that the band kept. Release and pressings The layout and packaging of the EP was managed by David Hayes and released on January 30, 1988 on Lookout Records with the catalog number LK 004. 2,000 copies were originally pressed on 7-inch vinyl and were number-stamped in red ink on the back and included a booklet with lyrics and other information. By mistake of the pressing plant, about 50 of these copies were pressed on blue marble vinyl. The third pressing was done in unknown quantities; they were not numbered on the back and the booklet was light blue instead of the original pink.Sleep, What's That? liner notes (third pressing).

His chronological position and identity are unclear. __FORCETOC__ Attestation Shenshek is known from a single scarab discovered in Avaris, modern Tell el-Dab'a, by the Egyptologist Manfred Bietak. The scarab is now in the Egyptian Museum, catalog number TD-6160[50].Manfred Bietak: Egypt and Canaan during the Middle Bronze Age, BASOR 281 (1991), p.52 & fig 18, available onlineI. Hein (editor): Pharaonen und fremde Dynastien im Dunkel, Museen der Stadt Wien, 1994, p. 145 Identity The primary historical source for the identification and chronological position of the rulers of the 14th Dynasty is the Turin canon, a king list compiled during the Ramesside period. The identification of Shenshek with one of the names on the list is difficult because the Turin canon only records the kings' prenomen while Shenshek is a nomen. Although the Egyptologists Darrell Baker and Kim Ryholt deem it likely that Shenshek is indeed recorded on the list, its identification will remain conjectural until an artefact bearing both Shenshek's nomen and prenomen is found. After his discovery of the seal, Bietak proposed that Shenshek is a variant of the name of king Maaibre Sheshi, whose chronological position is somewhat unclear but who could also belong to the 14th Dynasty. This hypothesis is rejected by Baker and Ryholt. Based on a seriation of the scarab-seals of the Second Intermediate Period, Ryholt proposed that Shenshek reigned after Nehesy and before Yaqub-Har.

History  After the death of the last member of the House of Andechs, Otto II and his successor, Count Albert III of Tyrol who died without male issue there was a division of inheritance in 1263 between Count Meinhard I of Gorizia and Count Gebhard VI Hirschberg; the areas north of the Inn went to the latter, including castrum Slozperch. Since this castle was designated as being owned by the Andechs family, it is assumed that it was built by them in the period before 1248. Certainly by 1281 (and therefore before the official transition of Hirschberg estates to Count Meinhard II, the son of Meinhard I, Gorizian- Tyrolean ministeriales appear here. Albert and R√ºdiger, sons of the Eberlins of Schlossberg and grandsons of Conrad of Schlossberg are entrusted here with the hereditary castle-guard (Burghut) of the castle. This family were lords of Eben near Inzing. The family died out with R√ºdiger of Eben, but also called themselves von Schlossberg even after losing the responsibility of the castle- guard. Towards the end of the 13th century the castle was further expanded, as is evidenced by various bills. In 1284 it was transferred from the counts of Eschenlohe to the counts of Tyrol and formed its border fortification with the County of Werdenfels.Grafschaft Werdenfels - Umfang und Grenzen der Grafschaft: Die tirolische Grenze p. 15, in: Altbayern Reihe I Heft 9: Grafschaft Werdenfels, Komm. f√ºr Bayerische Landesgeschichte, M√ºnchen 1955. The ecclesiastical divisions also followed this border: Scharnitz belonged to the Bishopric of Freising, Seefeld and Oberleutasch to the Bishopric of Brixen. Nevertheless the County of Werdenfels,maintained territorial claims up to the outskirts of Seefeld, citing the bishopric's borders of 1060 and later, unilateral, boundary records. The aim of the County of Tyrol was, by contrast, to push the state border up to the strategically important Scharnitz Pass.Daniel-Erasmus Khan: Die deutschen Staatsgrenzen - rechtshistorische Grundlagen und offene Rechtsfragen. Mohr Siebeck 2004, pp. 211 f. Preview at Google Books In 1314 the office of castle-guard was held by Hildebrand Perchtinger from Sistrans. From him it went in 1317 to Johannes von Liebenberg and then, in 1319/20, to Heinrich Perchtinger. In 1346 Heinrich St√∂ckel was appointed. At the outbreak of the War of the Tyrolean Succession in 1335 the castle, as an important border fortification, was further fortified and a tax, the steura nova raised to pay for it. In spite of these precautions, the castle was conquered in 1365 and 1368 by Bavarian troops, but was recaptured shortly afterwards by a Tyrolean contingent under the leadership of Petermann of Schenna, Burgrave of Tyrol. In the Treaty of Sch√§rding in 1369 the castle was returned to the joint regents, Duke Albert III and Leopold of Austria. In 1376 Gebhard von Weer is mentioned as the superintendent (Pfleger). In 1384‚Äì1393 he was followed by Oswald Milser, who had become known thanks to the legend of the miracle of the host in Seefeld. From this time arose the local name of Milser Schl√∂√ül for the castle. In 1421, Hans Ramung is the superintendent here, and then Hans Erber (1426), Burghard von Windeck (1435) and Mathias Gelter (1444). In 1455, Duke Sigismund enfeoffed the Schlo√überg to his nephew, Ulrich, Count of Cilli. He appears not to have been there long because as early as 1460 another superintendent, Burghard von Hausen, was in charge and he extended the castle at the behest of Sigismund. After the death of Burghard around 1478/80 Pankraz Hahn von Hahnberg became superintendent, then Paul Stickl (before 1481), Simon Pfab (1486/87) and Wolfgang von Windeck. Due to an earthquake in 1492 the castle was badly damaged, which led to complaints by its latest superintendent, Ulrich Hammerspach (died 1496). On 20 October 1500, Sigismund's successor, Maximilian I and Prince-Bishop Philip of Freising ratified the treaty agreed the year before which saw the border of Tyrol moved northwards to a kilometre in front of Scharnitz. Under Hammerspach's successor, Hans von Zwingenburg, the well piping was replaced in 1510/12 and building damage repaired. But the next superintendents, Nikolaus Mathias and Peter von Rada, complained of serious shortcomings. In 1547 the castle-guard was taken over by Christian Schw√§rzel. The construction work started by him was continued, after an interruption, by his successor in 1560, Alexander Gabelowitsch n√© Sandri. During the invasion of Tyrol by Elector Maurice of Saxony the castle was in good defensive order. It was not captured, but its own soldiers lost a lot here. In 1560 another new superintendent was appointed, Martin Fuchs, who also made a lot of complaints about the poor state of the building to the state treasury. These ended under the next incumbent, Johann Gwarientis (from 1569), because Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol underwrote the castle in 1586 with all the estate of the parish of Seefeld. The priest was incorporated in 1604 into the Augustine hermitage monastery in Seefeld and there was no longer a warden living in the castle itself. In 1633, after Tyrol had received permission from the Prince-Bishopric of Freising to build a fortification in the narrow section of the valley at Scharnitz, the subsequent Porta Claudia, Schlossberg Castle lost its importance and rapidly fell into ruins. In 1728 it was described as completed ruined and uninhabited. Around 1800 there were still a few outer walls, but by 1846 only low remains were left, probably because the nearby farmers had carted the stone away for their buildings. In 1911/12 the rest of the castle was demolished and used for the construction of the Mittenwald Railway. Schlossberg Castle and hermitage from 1590  21st century  The old castle is on a round hill north of Seefeld above the Dahnbach stream and at the foot of the Hochegg (). The road through the Scharenz runs past the castle site; a route that for centuries has linked Mittenwald and the Inn valley. In the area to the north of the Schlossberg hill, the gradient of this road was reduced in 1974 and the small hill completely dug up. During an emergency excavation carried out at the time the size of the inner ward from the 13th century was confirmed as and the outer walls were thick. It was partitioned by two dividing walls into three longitudinal areas. In the centre of the site was a small courtyard, . The entranceway lay on the southern side and was protected by a moat, over which the Schlo√üpruggen drove in 1549. At its corners there were pentagonal oriels for defensive fire. The main building was surrounded by a medieval Zwinger with walls thick, the southwest corner of which was fortified with a roundel (Rondell). A wall or letzi blocking access along the gorge (Klausenmauer, Wegsperre) ran from the east side of the castle to the street below and from there up the opposite hillside where it ended at the rocks.

The word \\"kettle\\" refers to encirclement by enemy forces, which is termed \\"falling into the kettle\\". The word is also used to refer to battles during the Second World War, such as the \\"Kiev Kettle\\". It is also applied to the early 2015 Battle of Debaltseve, which has been described as a \\"Second Ilovaisk\\". started on 7 August 2014, when the Armed Forces of Ukraine and pro-Ukrainian paramilitaries began a series of attempts to capture the city of Ilovaisk from pro-Russian insurgents affiliated with the self- proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and detachments of the Russian Armed Forces. Although Ukrainian forces were able to enter the city on 18 August, they were encircled between 24‚Äì26 August by overwhelming Russian military forces that crossed the border, joining the battle. After days of encirclement, government forces made an agreement with the insurgents to allow them to retreat from the city. This agreement was not honoured, and many soldiers died whilst trying to escape. The Chief of the General Staff and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Viktor Muzhenko, stated on 26 August 2016 that the cause of the battle's outcome was the involvement of Russian troops, along with Ukrainian commanders' incompetence in the planning of the retreat.Kyiv honoring soldiers killed in 2014 Ilovaisk battle, UNIAN (29 August 2016) Events left =Prelude= Since 11 July 2014, the area of Donetsk Oblast suffered from artillery shelling from Russian territory.

Soon after securing the area around the Savur-Mohyla hill (Amvrosiivka Raion and Shakhtarsk Raion) in late July 2014, on 31 July 2014, a battalion of the 25th Airborne Brigade was sent to assault Shakhtarsk. During the attack, the battalion lost 26 soldiers and passed the city from East traveling North conducting a raid towards villages Petropavlivka and Orlovo-Ivanivka. Two other battalions traveling pass Torez and Snizhne were supposed to reach Miusynsk. Along the movement, those battalions of the 30th and 95th brigades lost communication between each other, but later the battalion of the 95th Brigade met with the battalion of the 25th Brigade near Orlovo-Ivanivka and exited towards Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve. On 11 August the Ukrainian mass media loudly presented the maneuver as a successful raid through the rears of the opponent; however, results and purpose of it are still not disclosed.

Ukrainian troops made their first attempts to attack Ilovaisk on 7 August 2014. Over the next few days, Ukrainian forces made multiple attempts to enter the city but were bogged down by heavy fighting with the insurgents. =Ukrainian forces enter Ilovaisk= DPR fighters and BTR-80 assault the Azov and Dnipro Battalions Motorola's Division fighters in Ilovaisk left Ukrainian forces attempted to enter Ilovaisk during the day on 18 August but failed. Led by the Donbas Battalion, government forces launched another attempt to storm the city on the night of 18‚Äì19 August. This attempt was successful, and they raised the Ukrainian flag over the city administration building without any casualties. Ukrainian media viewed this victory as an example of the strength and effectiveness of the government's \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" (ATO) against the insurgents. As government forces entered the city, Donbas Battalion commander Semen Semenchenko was wounded after being struck by mortar fire and was evacuated for medical treatment. Following the flag-raising, the Internal Affairs ministry said that Ukrainian military, including the Donbas, Dnipro and Azov, were clearing the city of \\"terrorists\\", specifically mentioning that they killed \\"a great number\\" of insurgents from the Oplot Battalion of the Donbass People's Militia. They also said that reinforcements from the National Guard of Ukraine were forthcoming. After a day of fighting, roughly fifty percent of Ilovaisk was under government control. Government forces also captured six insurgents, including one Serbian volunteer. Azov and Shakhtarsk battalions left the battle of Ilovaisk that day, heading to reinforce garrisons of Mariupol and Komsomolske cities accordingly. On the following day, 20 August, Ukrainian forces claimed they had taken complete control of Ilovaisk. Said statement was denied by DPR officials, who declared that they remained in control. Over the course of the day, government forces fought off numerous insurgent counter-attacks. Street battles took place across the city, and at least nine Ukrainian soldiers were killed in the fighting. Following this, the Donbas Battalion requested reinforcements. By 21 August, amidst the heavy and constant fighting, the Internal Affairs ministry stated that twenty-five percent of those from volunteer paramilitary battalions killed since the ATO began were killed in Ilovaisk. No reinforcements for government forces arrived. According to commander Semenchenko, some members of the Donbas Battalion were killed when insurgents flying the Ukrainian flag attacked an ambulance. Semenchenko described this act as \\"medieval savagery\\". He also said that the Donbas Battalion had been \\"abandoned\\" by both the Ukrainian government and the other volunteer paramilitary battalions, both of which largely withdrew from the city. =Encirclement of Ukrainian troops; Ilovaisk under siege= Map of the encirclement The remaining Ukrainian forces in Ilovaisk became completely encircled by DPR insurgents and Russian reinforcements on 24‚Äì26 August, and the fighting continued to take its toll. Ukrainian soldiers started seeing Russian regular army troops on 24 August, and their presence increased over the next few days. On 24 August, around 12:15 AM, a column of BMD-2s of the 331st Airborne Regiment was hit by a Ukrainian anti-tank squad of the 51st Mechanized Brigade near Kuteinykove village. Two BMD-2's were destroyed. The paratroopers left their vehicles and took cover in trees nearby. Several hours later, around 5 PM, they left their cover and were captured by the reconnaissance group of the 51st Mechanized Brigade near Dzerkalne village, the Ukrainian battalion tactical group's field headquarters. Ten paratroopers were captured. On 26 August, a T-72B3 tank of the 6th Tank Brigade was captured by Ukrainian troops of the 51st Mechanized Brigade in a fight near Ahronomichne village. The captured tank took part in another fight that day near Mnohopillya village where the Russian column of mixed 8th Mountain Brigade's and 31st Air Assault Brigade's units were ambushed by Ukrainian anti-tank artillery squad of the 51st Mechanized Brigade. Two soldiers of the 31st Air Assault Brigade and one wounded soldier of the 8th Mountain Brigade were captured by Ukrainian forces. According to the DPR, a large number of Ukrainian soldiers and paramilitaries were trapped in the town. During the fighting, the Ukrainian commander of the Dnipro Battalion suffered a concussion, while the commander of the Kherson Battalion was killed. In response to commander Semenchenko's pleas, many Euromaidan activists in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv protested what they saw as the government's \\"abandonment\\" of the volunteers fighting against the insurgents. Repeated artillery barrages launched by insurgent forces from nearby villages caused heavy casualties amongst the trapped government forces. = Attempt to free encircled forces = The Ukrainian command attempted to free the encircled forces near Ilovaisk. The company tactical group was formed from 92nd Mechanized Brigade that had 276 soldiers, 4 tanks, 3 SPGs and 10+ IFVs. It was sent from Kharkiv oblast in the direction of Ilovaisk on 24 August 2014, after it became clear Russian military forces approached Ilovaisk. The unit was supposed to meet an assault squad from Rukh Oporu Battalion and attempt to breach the Russian encirclement. Rukh Oporu squad had 90 soldiers and was equipped with 2 IFVs. 92 Brigade's company arrived on 27 August to Komsomolske city and advanced towards Ilovaisk. The column stopped in the field for a night and shortly after it was hit by heavy artillery shelling. The next morning it was completely defeated by Russian paratroopers, losing most vehicles but having relatively low troops casualties, suffering only 8 people dead and several missing. The same fate met Rukh Oporu squad which was defeated on 28 August morning nearby, with the units never meeting. =Government forces retreat and massacre= After days of being under siege in Ilovaisk, commanders of government forces in the city attempted to negotiate an agreement that would allow them to withdraw from the city. Russian president Vladimir Putin said in the early morning on 29 August that a \\"humanitarian corridor for besieged Ukrainian soldiers\\" should be established, allowing the trapped soldiers to leave Ilovaisk. Yuriy Bereza, a commander in the Dnipro Battalion, managed to quickly reach an agreement with Russian commanders in Ilovaisk to establish such a corridor. DPR prime minister Alexander Zakharchenko confirmed that an agreement had been made, and also said that Ukrainian forces were required to leave their armoured vehicles and ammunition behind as a condition of the agreement. On 29 August at 06:00, government forces began to move out of Ilovaisk in a column of sixty vehicles. At 8:00, government forces regrouped at Mnohopillya, just south of Ilovaisk proper, forming 2 columns, Northern and Southern, and prepared to withdraw. Northern column led by Gen. Ruslan Khomchak was formed from forces of the 17th Tank Brigade, 51st Mechanized Brigade and police units, it had 4 tanks, several IFVs and ~1000 troops. Southern column led by Col. Oleksii Grachov was formed from forces of 93rd Mechanized Brigade and Donbas battalion, it had 2 tanks, including a captured Russian T-72B3, a couple of IFVs, and roughly 600 troops. As this was happening, the Russian commanders attempted to change the terms of the agreement, suggesting a new route out of Ilovaisk, demanding that Ukrainian forces surrender all weaponry and that they leave behind the volunteer battalions. Lt. General Ruslan Khomchak, commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Ilovaisk, replied that his troops would leave as agreed previously, and ordered them \\"to march in full battle readiness\\". The first lorry in the column, carrying dead and wounded soldiers, was flying a white flag. The Northern column advanced along the corridor, about an hour's drive, but was then surrounded by Russian and insurgent troops. At the Oleksandrivka village, 2 T-72BAs and an IFV of the Russian 21st Motor Rifle Brigade were destroyed in a clash with Ukrainian forces. Near the Krasnaya Polyana valley to North-East of Horbatenko village Russian troops opened fire on the Northern column with mortars and heavy machine guns, splitting it into two. Half of the column with tanks headed further to Novokaterynivka village while the tail was obliterated, having 6 IFVs and multiple cars of police units destroyed. That valley had a battery of D-30 howitzers of the Russian 1065th Artillery Regiment deployed. Several trucks of the regiment were destroyed near the artillery positions. The armored head of the column reached Novokaterynivka village where several dug in tanks and IFVs were spotted by Ukrainian tankers of the 17th Tank Brigade. After a brief clash, all 4 Ukrainian tanks and IFVs were destroyed. Some crews were able to leave vehicles, 42 Ukrainian soldiers made it out of the encirclement and reached Ukrainian positions. During the withdrawal of the Southern column of Ukrainian forces, around 300 Ukrainian soldiers and Donbas Battalion fighters were able to take Chervonosilske village, losing several IFVs, after the fire was opened on the column by Russian forces. Ukrainian troops seized and destroyed 2 T-72B3 tanks of 6th Tank Brigade that were in that village, captured 2 of brigade's soldiers and 2 paratroopers of 31st Air Assault Brigade. Half of the Ukrainian soldiers were already wounded, but they managed to hold the village till the next day. On 30 August, Dnipro-2 Battalion commander Yuriy Lysenko attempted to contact Russian commanders. They made an agreement according to which Ukrainian forces will surrender their weapons and will be evacuated under the Red Cross guidance, releasing captured Russian POWs. By 31 August, almost all of the Ukrainian soldiers had withdrawn to agreed upon positions with Russia and the DPR insurgents re-entered the city on the same day. The city was fully secured on 1 September. Small scale fighting continued for another day until 2 September.  Casualties  Burnt civilian car in Ilovaisk after shelling One fleeing Ukrainian soldier described the situation as \\"a real meat grinder\\". The Ukrainian government described the events as a \\"massacre\\". One insurgent commander said he had taken 173 Ukrainian soldiers prisoner near Ilovaisk, in the aftermath of the ambush. He said that he would use them as laborers to rebuild destroyed Donbass cities. A Ukrainian official said that, in total, more than 500 Ukrainian soldiers had been taken prisoner by pro-Russian forces. Commanders and soldiers of the Ukrainian volunteer paramilitary battalions blamed the Ilovaisk incident on Ukrainian army leadership and felt \\"betrayed by Ukraine\\" in its aftermath. According to an advisor of Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov, 97 Ukrainian soldiers managed to escape from Ilovaisk on 1 September. Known Russian captured soldiers: * 10 soldiers of the 331st Guards Airborne Regiment (soldiers were acknowledged by the Russian government officials later)Regained consciousness and appeared to be located in Ukraine. Gazeta.ru. 17 September 2014 * 1 soldier (driver) of the 8th Guards Mountain Motor Rifle BrigadeBodies of the Russian Army soldiers near Ilovaisk * 4 soldiers of the 31st Guards Air Assault BrigadeRussian Airborne Akhmetov and Ilmitov. Lifenews * 2 soldiers of the 6th Tank BrigadeRussian soldiers that participated in military action in the eastern Ukraine = Civilian casualties = After withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from Ilovaisk, a mass grave with three bodies was exhumed in the backyard of Ilovaisk school No. 14 where the Donbas battalion had been stationed. UN monitoring mission OHCHR identified the victims as local civilians. According to the forensic reports, two of them had signs of firearm wounds on their bodies, and third had probably died as a result of shelling. UN monitoring mission had stated that the killings, including executions, carried out by Ukrainian forces, were not of massive or systematic scale. Allegations referring to such scale, including those broadly disseminated through the media, have not been supported by reliable witness accounts and/or forensic data.  Aftermath  A criminal probe into the failure of government troops in Ilovaisk was opened 4 September by the office of Prosecutor General of Ukraine. On the same date, a temporary parliamentary commission (TSK) headed by Batkivshchyna politician Andriy Senchenko was created and approved by 226 (out of 446) members of the Ukrainian parliament. According to the Head of the Verkhovna Rada's Ilovaisk investigative committee Andriy Senchenko, at least 1,000 soldiers alone died in the Battle of Ilovaisk. Defence Minister Valeriy Heletey was forced to resign on 14 October, in part because of his responsibility for the failure of military coordination during the battle. In Russian nationalist circles the Russian forces that joined the battle are commonly referred to as \\"The Northern wind\\" (). Since 2019 Ukraine observers the Day of Remembrance of the Defenders of Ukraine annually on August 29.Day of Remembrance of Ukraine‚Äôs Defenders marked today, Ukrinform (29 August 2020) This day was chosen because 29 August 2014 was the day of the greatest Ukrainian losses during the Battle of Ilovaisk.

He also campaigns against bullying. Autism activism In 2001, Healey founded the North Staffordshire Asperger's & Autism Association (NSAAA). In 2007, Healey founded the Staffordshire Adults Autistic Society (SAAS), which provides support to adults with autism including activities such as outings as well as educational programs and a helpline. In 2010, he launched a campaign entitled \\"It's Time For Change ‚Äî Stand-up For Autism\\" which aimed to improve government response to the needs of people with autism and their families in the UK. This campaign attracted support from both members of Parliament and the public, and Healey delivered a petition to the Prime Minister's office signed by 4,000 people in favour of such expanded services and funding. He was also a trustee for the National Autistic Society, which is the largest autism charity in the UK, until he stood down from the role in 2016. Healey published an autobiography, Twin Brothers Worlds Apart, in 2009, sales of which benefit SAAS, his autism charity. This book has been adapted for a short film that was released under the same title in 2017, which was directed by Andrew Dobosz. In 2014, he released a short documentary about cyber-bullying. He hosted his own show on Blog Talk Radio but stopped broadcasting in 2011, and he also founded internet-based Autism Radio UK. Anti-bullying campaign Healey initiated a global anti-bullying campaign in 2014, which is supported by Ricky Gervais, Katie Price, and Keith Duffy. Healey has been the victim of cyberbullying and harassment on Twitter due to his activism. This bullying included not only online harassment and cloning (impersonation) of his Twitter account, but also threats to \\"sever [his] legs\\" or kill him. Taking into consideration the information that some of those bullying him had learned what neighbourhood he lived in, Healey found those threats credible enough that he did not leave his home for three months. Police investigated both the threats and over a dozen cases of impersonation. Healey's experiences motivated him to raise awareness about cyberbullying and online harassment of those with autism. He advocates for making the bullying of a person with a developmental disability a crime. Recognition Healey had won awards including a British Citizen Award for Volunteering and Charitable Giving in 2017, Stoke-On-Trent Citizen of the Year in 2006 and Charity Champion of the year in 2007. He was selected to carry the Olympic torch in Crewe on 31 May 2012. A charity Healey founded, Staffordshire Adults Autistic Society (SAAS), was one of 112 groups that received the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2012.

It is located in the Saur√•s neighborhood in the borough of √Ösane in the city of Bergen. It used to be the church for the √Ösane parish which is part of the √Ösane prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, stone church was built in a long church style in 1795 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 240 people. The church was consecrated in 1795 by the Bishop Johan Nordahl Brun. The church was historically called Aasene kirke (√Ösane Church), but today uses the modern Norwegian spelling of √Ösane kirke. The word gamle means \\"old\\". The church is no longer regularly-used since the \\"new\\" √Ösane Church was built in 1993. This church is now mostly used for funerals and weddings as well as special events. History The first church here was built in the Middle Ages, probably in the 13th century. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1598. The old wooden church stood there for about 500 years, before it was torn down and replaced with a new stone church in 1795. Local tradition says that the new stone church was erected around the outside of the old wooden building so that it could be used during the construction. The new church was consecrated by the Bishop Johan Nordahl Brun. The chapel served the whole √Ösane peninsula which was historically a annex to the important Hamre Church nearby. In 1871, the chapel was designated as a church and it became a separate parish. Starting in the 1960s, discussions began about replacing the old church with a new, larger, more functional church for the quickly growing urban area of √Ösane, but nothing was done at that point. On Christmas Eve 1992, the church was set on fire by J√∏rn Tunsberg and it sustained heavy damage. The church was completely rebuilt using same foundation and thick stone walls as the burned-down building. Old photographs and pictures of the church were used to make sure the replacement would be the same as before. The church building was replaced, but many historic artifacts and artwork were lost in the fire. The rebuilt church was re-consecrated on 19 November 1995 by the Bishop Ole Danbolt Hages√¶ther. This church was the main church of the √Ösane parish until 1993 when the \\"new\\" √Ösane Church was completed a short distance away.

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, Fury 325 opened to the public on March 28, 2015. It features a track that reaches a maximum height of , making it the fifth-tallest roller coaster in the world and the tallest overall among roller coasters that use a traditional . Riders experience speeds of up to , winding through high-speed curves and passing over and under the park's main entrance. Fury 325 has also been voted the world's best steel coaster in Amusement Todays Golden Ticket Awards for four consecutive years beginning in 2016, ending Millennium Force's six-year streak. History Sections of track waiting to be installed in 2014 In September 2012, the Charlotte City Council discussed plans for a proposed roller coaster in one of its meetings and it was revealed the ride would cost approximately $30 million. In a closed-session meeting, it was mentioned that the roller coaster would stand higher than the park's Intimidator roller coaster which stands at , meaning the new coaster would be high. On October 18, January 23, 2014, and June 9, Cedar Fair Entertainment Company, the owners of Carowinds, filed trademark applications for the names Centurion, Fury, and Fury 325. In February, the Centurion trademark was suspended after another trademark application using the same name was found by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In July, the blueprints for Fury 325 were leaked showing the exact layout of the roller coaster. At the beginning of August, the park sent a beekeeper to deliver a partially burnt bug net with a card saying, \\"you're gonna need a much bigger net to capture the thrills of the 2015 Carowinds season\\", to several media outlets in the Charlotte area. On August 12, a microsite on Carowinds' website was found advertising a new ride called Centurion. A similar hoax was conducted by Kings Island leading up to the announcement of Banshee in 2013. Carowinds officially announced Fury 325 on August 22, 2014 at an event held at the park's Harmony Hall Marketplace. The first piece of track was installed on September 29, 2014. Within the week, the structure for the storage track was erected. By October 22, the majority of the brake run was complete; two days later the final pieces for the section were put into place. By October 26, the base of the lift hill was installed. On December 4, the lift hill and first drop were completed. On January 30, 2015, the final piece of Fury 325's track was put in place. Fury 325 completed its first test run on March 4, 2015. On March 25, 2015, Carowinds held the coaster's media day. Ride experience Once the train is loaded and secured, it dispatches from the station and immediately passes over the transfer track. Afterwards, the train climbs the chain lift hill. Once at the top, the train drops toward the ground at an 81-degree angle reaching a maximum speed of approximately . Following the drop, the train enters a high barrel turn. It then travels through a high speed s-curve, making its way to the park's north entrance. Passing over the entrance, the train makes a banked turn to the left leading into a high horseshoe. At the top of the horseshoe, the train hits a 91-degree angle before dropping toward the ground and under the entrance pathway. It then enters a second banked turn to the left, reaching a height of . Following a straight section of track, the train goes over a camelback hill and makes a near-180-degree turn. It then enters a second camelback hill, followed by a left turn into a third camelback hill that ends with the final brake run. The train makes a 180-degree turn as it returns to the station. According to Carowinds, the total ride time is three minutes and 25 seconds. Characteristics =Track= The steel track of Fury 325 is long and the lift is high. Due to the ride‚Äôs height and proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, the park had to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to build the attraction. The track is mostly teal with a lime-green bottom, while the supports are white. A total of of paint was used and the total weight of the track is approximately . The roller coaster uses approximately of land. =Trains= Fury 325 operates with three open- air, steel and fiberglass trains, each containing eight cars. Each car seats four riders in a single row for a total of 32 riders per train. Every seat has its own lap bar restraint and seat belt. This configuration of trains gives the roller coaster a theoretical capacity of 1,470 riders per hour. =Theme= The roller coaster is themed after a hornet: riders chase their target at high speeds, similar to a hornet. The inspiration came from the American Revolution when Charlotte was \\"a hornet's nest of rebellion\\". Despite the teal color of the track matching the teal of the Charlotte Hornets logo, Carowinds did not say if the NBA team had any influence on the final color scheme of the ride. The team's original name had been restored from \\"Charlotte Bobcats\\" for the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season. Records Fury 325 set new records and came close to breaking others when it opened in 2015. It became the world's tallest giga coaster ‚Äì a roller coaster that exceeds in height ‚Äì surpassing Steel Dragon 2000 by . Its maximum speed of ties it with Steel Dragon 2000 for being the fastest among roller coasters with a traditional lift hill. , Fury 325 is the seventh fastest, fifth tallest, and fourth longest roller coaster in the world. In North American rankings, the roller coaster is the tallest, fastest, and longest among non-launched, steel roller coasters. Fury 325 is also the tallest to be built by Bolliger & Mabillard, following on the heels of the company's first giga coaster, Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland, which opened in 2012. Leviathan reaches a maximum height of . Reception Initial reception following the announcement of the ride was positive. Chip Sieczko, a representative from American Coaster Enthusiasts, said, \\"This is not a Carolina story, this is not a national story. This is an international deal. It's going to be insane.\\" Arthur Levine from About.com stated that the roller coaster will make an impression at the front of the park. Awards Fury 325 claimed the Best New Ride of 2015 from the 2015 Golden Ticket Awards (GTA), ranking fourth overall among steel coasters. It was voted the best overall steel roller coaster in the same awards publication the following year, and has retained the top position ever since.

Brad Ludden, a professional kayaker, founded First Descents in 2001 at age 20. \\"The program, designed for those 18 or older, is a weeklong camp that offers participants a chance to share what they are going through and then tackle another scary obstacle ‚Äî running rapids in a kayak,\\" the New York Times wrote about First Descents. First Descent recruited a number of successful businesspeople to serve on the board of directors. Joel Appel, an entrepreneur who co-founded Orange Glo International which he sold for $325 million, sits on the board. Pete Worley, president of Teva and Simple Brands; and two former Google executives, Eva Ho and Jennifer Feiken, also sit on the board. How it works Before an adventure experience trip, staff members create unique goals for each participant. During the trip, participants attempt to meet their goals through participation in complete specific outdoor challenges. The challenges can include climbing, paddling, and surfing. For example, participants have paddled Class 2 rapids on the Colorado River. Participants receive food, lodging, and activities free of charge. First Descents gives travel scholarships to participants who need them. An onsite medical staff, including an oncologist, is present on all trips. Brad Ludden \\"Brad Ludden is a world-class whitewater kayaker,\\" CNN wrote in 2012. He has kayaked in over 40 countries. He does what is known as a \\"first descent\\", meaning to successfully paddle over a river or section of a river that has never been done by anyone before. As of 2012, Ludden had completed over 100 first descents. In 2007, Ludden turned over the running of the excursions to experienced staff members. The 19th installment of First Descents, which took place on the Colorado River in 2007, was the first expedition that Ludden didn't run. Participation In 2011, First Descents offered 27 outdoor programs. Two hundred eighty-three people participated. In 2012, the number of outdoor programs grew to 45. The number of participants grew to 515. In 2013, First Descents ran programs in 12 states and 3 countries. Over 515 cancer patients participated in 2012. The current wait list is 1,000 people. Out Living It documentary First Descents founder Brad Ludden approached a filmmaker named Michael Brown, a three-time Emmy award winner and friend of Ludden's who specialized in documenting outdoor expeditions. After hearing about Ludden's organization, Brown agreed to direct a documentary about Ludden's adventure experiences with cancer survivors. First Descents launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the documentary, and by April 2012 raised $21,507 from 142 people. For one week, Ludden and 14 other young adult cancer survivors spend a week together in the outdoors. They go on physical adventures including kayaking through white water rapids and rock climbing. Brown filmed the adventures and interviewed the participants. In the video trailer, during a clip of a rock climbing scene, one man can be heard saying, \\"Trust is a great thing to have. Especially among people who have similar problems.\\" The film was released on April 14, 2012.

Historically, the majority of the firm's investments have been in technology startups based outside of Silicon Valley, including in Europe, the UK, the US and Canada. Valar Ventures originally spun out of Thiel Capital, Peter Thiel's global parent company based in San Francisco, and is now headquartered near Union Square in New York City. The firm's namesake is the Valar of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, who are god- like immortal spirits that chose to enter the mortal world to prepare it for their living creations. Andrew McCormack and James Fitzgerald are the managing partners of the firm. Investments Valar was notably the first venture fund to invest in Xero. The fund made its initial investment in Xero in October 2010 at a valuation of approximately $98 million. Since then, the firm has spearheaded successive rounds of investment in the company and Xero's market cap has grown to more than $4 billion as of February 2014. Valar also led TransferWise's Series A and Series B financing rounds in January 2013 and April 2014, respectively. Following Valar's investment, Andreessen Horowitz led TransferWise's Series C and Baillie Gifford led the company's Series D in 2016 at a $1.1 billion valuation. Both Xero and TransferWise were investments out of Valar's $100M first fund, which was a series of special purpose vehicles, including a $32 million New Zealand specific fund. From its two funds, Valar has led investments in several startups including Xero, TransferWise, Breather, Number26, EyeEm, Even, Lystable, Granify, Homie, TradeIt, Vend, Descomplica, Oppa and Dinda. In 2016, N26 received ‚Ç¨10 million in a series A round by Valar.

If many people did this, then a ubiquitous global public wireless network would be created which would achieve and surpass the goal of increasing Internet access. The project was initiated in November 2012 by a coalition of ten advocacy groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Fight for the Future, Free Press, Internet Archive, NYCwireless, Open Garden, OpenITP, the Open Spectrum Alliance, the Open Technology Institute, and the Personal Telco Project. EFF representative Adi Kamdar commented, \\"We envision a world where sharing one's Internet connection is the norm. A world of open wireless would encourage privacy, promote innovation, and largely benefit the public good. And everyone‚Äîusers, businesses, developers, and Internet service providers‚Äîcan get involved.\\" As of September 2016, seventeen groups have joined the project, adding Engine, Mozilla, Noisebridge, the Open Rights Group, OpenMedia International, Sudo Room, and the Center for Media Justice. The project uses various strategies to encourage and assist people to make their Internet connections available for public use. It explains the benefits and drawbacks of the effects on society and on the owners of routers, answers questions regarding safety and legality, guides novice users in configuring their routers, and provides firmware for novices to install on their routers. The EFF created a fork of OpenWrt firmware called OpenWireless which anyone may volunteer to install on their router to make it work for the OpenWireless.org project. This firmware was first shared at the 2014 Hackers on Planet Earth conference. Its developers set out to achieve simple installation on a wide range of hardware routers but struggled with the diversity of closed, proprietary devices, and development of the OpenWireless firmware was deprioritized in April 2015.

However, in 1968, Lyons left the Louisiana GOP to join the American Independent Party, through which as the American Party, he waged in 1972 an unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate. Lyons's father, Charlton Lyons, had been the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1964 and the state party chairman from 1964 to 1968. Background =Family ancestry= Born in Shreveport, where his parents had relocated in 1921, Lyons was given his mother's maiden surname as a first name and his great-aunt's married name as a middle name. =Education, military, and oil industry= Young Lyons was educated in Shreveport at the public South Highlands Elementary School and the private Southfield School with instruction through the eighth grade. He graduated from the college preparatory Lawrenceville School, a boarding school in Lawrenceville in Mercer County in central New Jersey. After enlistment in the United States Naval Reserve, Lyons studied at Centenary College in Shreveport, where the Marjorie Lyons Playhouse is named for his mother, and then Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. Lyons received his commission as an ensign in the Navy through the Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago, Illinois. Lyons was then assigned to duty at Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Islands. While headed to Leyte, his plane developed engine trouble and was compelled to land at Peleliu Island. The noted newspaperman Ernie Pyle was aboard the altered flight. Upon reaching Leyte, the small ship to which Lyons had been assigned had already departed for the invasion of Okinawa off the Japanese coast. He finally reached Okinawa Island, where he remained for eighteen months. At the end of the war, Lyons was in command of the ship called USS Landing Craft Tank 1326. While in Okinawa, he found relief from military duties to plan a duck hunt, the story of which was carried on June 1, 1946, in the sporting-dog magazine, American Field. After the war, Lyons completed his studies at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, from which in 1949 he received a degree in arts and sciences. After the war, Lyons lived for several years in San Antonio, Texas, where he was employed in the petroleum business with his father and a cousin, Newton Hall McCord (born in 1915 in New Orleans), who later settled in Houston, Texas. Lyons returned to Shreveport to become a partner in his family-owned C. H. Lyons Petroleum Company, formerly known as the Lyons, McCord & Logan company. When he lived in Shreveport, Lyons was, like his mother, active in the musical community there. A former president of the Shreveport Symphony Orchestra, which was founded in 1948, Lyons often sang in opera presentations.Hall M. Lyons obituary, The Shreveport Times, July 26, 1998 In 1960, Lyons relocated to Lafayette, Louisiana, to become an independent oil producer. He also operated at least two wells in Pointe Coupee Parish in South Louisiana, the second from January 1977 to October 1978. In 1985, Lyons was listed as president of Golden Eagle Mining, Inc., in Lafayette, a company since inactive. Political life =Republican House campaign= In 1966, having resided for nearly six years in Lafayette, Lyons entered the first of his two political races as a candidate. He challenged the reelection of the nine-term Democrat U.S. Representative Edwin E. Willis of St. Martinville for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district seat, now held by the Republican Charles Boustany of Lafayette. Willis had first defeated two fellow Democrats in the 1966 party primary, State Representative Dick Guidry of Lafourche Parish and State Senator Dudley J. LeBlanc of Vermilion Parish, who had made a fortune in the patent medicine Hadacol. Lyons accused Willis of being too closely aligned with U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Great Society social policy.Lafayette Daily Advertiser, November 9, 1966, p. 1 Republicans also claimed that Willis's health had diminished after he sustained in February 1966 a series of strokes which required surgery.Shreveport Journal, November 9, 1966, p. 2 Lyons polled 31,444 votes (40.3 percent) in a district in which no Republican had been elected since Reconstruction. Despite health issues, Willis received 46,533 votes (59.7 percent). Lyons obtained a slim majority in Iberia Parish and finished with 46 percent in Lafayette Parish.Louisiana Secretary of State, Louisiana general election returns, November 8, 1966 His defeat of Lyons marked Willis's last victory at the polls; he was unseated in the 1968 Democratic primary election by Patrick T. Caffery, who retained the seat for two terms before retiring to return to his law practice in New Iberia, Louisiana. Charlton Lyons had waged a campaign in December 1961 for Louisiana's 4th congressional district seat against the incoming Democrat Joe D. Waggonner of Bossier Parish, who won the right to succeed Overton Brooks of Shreveport, who had died in office three months earlier. Running with Lyons in the same Third Congressional District in 1966 was Charles deGravelles, an oil landman from Lafayette and the successor of Charlton Lyons as state Republican chairman. DeGravelles failed to unseat Harvey Peltier, Sr., in a race for the since reconfigured Louisiana State Board of Education, now the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.State of Louisiana: Secretary of State, Election Returns, 1965-1966, p. 28 =American Party= Unlike his father, who was a staunch supporter of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon in all three presidential campaigns and helped to deliver critical delegates to Nixon at the 1968 Republican National Convention, Hall Lyons grew disillusioned with the liberal influence within the national Republican Party.Hall Lyons was particularly critical of such Moderate Republicans as Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who led the Republican minority in the U.S. Senate from 1969 to 1977 and was usually at odds with party conservatives. Senators Jacob Javits of New York, Clifford P. Case of New Jersey, Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, and Charles Mathias of Maryland and Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York held considerable influence on the party as well. Lyons hence left his father's Republican Party to join the American Independent Party, an organization founded by Bill Shearer in California in 1967 and known for its nomination of George C. Wallace, the governor of Alabama at the time, as its presidential candidate in 1968 against Nixon and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Hall Lyons supported Wallace in 1968 and planned to run for governor himself in the Louisiana general election held on February 1, 1972. He faced the prospect of running on the American Party label without his father's support, as the elder Lyons was the finance chairman for Republican nominee David C. Treen,\\"Charlton Lyons Is Named Treen Finance Chairman,\\" Minden Press-Herald, July 13, 1971, p. 1. then of Jefferson Parish, where Hall Lyons subsequently spent his later years.Grover Rees, Dave Treen of Louisiana (Baton Rouge: Moran Publishing Company, 1979), p. 47. Lyons cited \\"corruption in high places in Louisiana ... a cancer that must be cut out in an emergency operation.\\"\\"Hall N. Lyons Is Candidate,\\" Minden Press-Herald,\\" November 11, 1971, p. 1. However, a few weeks before the election, Lyons abandoned his candidacy and endorsed Treen, in his words, \\"so the cause of conservative unity might best be served.\\"Shreveport Journal, January 3, 1972, p. 1.\\"Lyons Says Conservatives Should Unite With Treen\\", Minden Press-Herald, January 4, 1972, p. 1. Treen went on to lose the general election that year to Democrat Edwin Edwards, then the U.S. Representative from Louisiana's 7th congressional district, since disbanded. Treen nevertheless later became the first Louisiana Republican since 1891 to hold a seat in the United States House of Representatives. Treen represented the same but revised Third District in which Lyons had run six years earlier against Edwin Willis.New Orleans Times Picayune, November 8, 1972, p. 1. In 1979, Treen was elected as his state's first Republican governor since 1877.Official election returns, 1979\\", Baton Rouge State-Times, December 22, 1979, p. 16C. In 1972, Lyons ran as the American Party Senate candidate though the state GOP offered its own nominee, Ben Toledano, a lawyer and conservative author from New Orleans who had run unsuccessfully for mayor early in 1970 against the Democrat Moon Landrieu. The Senate seat had been occupied since 1936 by the Democrat Allen J. Ellender of Houma, who died during the primary campaign. Victory in the November 7 general election went to the regular Democratic candidate, J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., a former member of the Louisiana Senate, a gubernatorial runoff candidate against Edwards in 1971, and an attorney from Lyons's native Shreveport.The Shreveport Times, November 8, 1972, p. 1 Former Governor John McKeithen, who had defeated Charlton Lyons for governor in 1964, ran as an Independent in the general election because filing in the Democratic primary was not reopened after Ellender's death. With 250,161 votes (23.1 percent), McKeithen finished second to Johnston, who prevailed with 598,987 (55.2 percent).Coincidentally, both Charlton Lyons and Hall Lyons were ballot opponents of John McKeithen some eight years apart. Lyons drew 28,910 votes statewide (2.6 percent); Toledano, 206,846 (19.1 percent). Neither Lyons nor Toledano polled a plurality in a single parish, but Toledano's best showing was his 30 percent in Jefferson Parish, a frequent base parish of the Republican Party in Louisiana. In his 49-state sweep that year, President Nixon secured Louisiana's then ten electoral votes, having won all parishes except West Feliciana.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 7, 1972. Nixon was only the third Republican to have won in Louisiana since Reconstruction.The first Republicans to win in Louisiana for U.S. President since Reconstruction were Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 and Barry M. Goldwater in 1964. =With Lyndon LaRouche= Lyons's subsequent political activities are murky. In 1984, he did not return to the Republican Party to support Ronald W. Reagan, who had campaigned for Lyons's father in the Louisiana governor's race in 1964,Perry H. Howard, Political Tendencies in Louisiana Revised and Expanded Edition (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1977), p. 392 Instead, Hall Lyons contributed $2,600 in four checks that summer to the National Democratic Policy Committee, a group backing political activist Lyndon LaRouche, a former Trotskyite who pursued the Democratic presidential nomination that year against Walter Mondale. In June 1985, Lyons made a small contribution to LaRouche, the fifth donation in less than a year. Death Lyons died at the age of seventy-four after a brief illness in Jefferson, a census-designated place in Jefferson Parish near New Orleans. He had been in semi-retirement at nearby Grand Isle in the Gulf of Mexico for a number of years. Lyons was preceded in death by his first wife, Betty Sue Buffington (1925-1993), the daughter of Culver W. Buffington and the former Nevva Scott. Betty Sue and Hall Lyons had four surviving children. After their divorce in 1960, she married Billy Carl McKeever (1930-2002). The McKeevers are interred together at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport. Lyons's second wife from whom he was divorced, Ann B. Barras (born October 1936) of Lafayette, is the oldest of three children of Herbert Paul and Hazel Marie Barras. She was briefly a music teacher at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and a private piano instructor. She is the mother of his two youngest children. The gravestone of Louisiana oilman and politician Hall McCord Lyons at Shreveport's Forest Park East Cemetery Lyons was also survived by his third wife, the former Rosamond Jane Rosholt, known as \\"Roz\\" Lyons (born 1922) of Grand Isle, whom he married in 1975; his brother, Charlton Havard Lyons, Jr. (1921-2019), born in New Orleans but an attorney and oilman who has spent most of his life in Shreveport; his sister-in-law, Susybelle Lyons, a Shreveport socialite since deceased; three daughters, Marjorie Scott Lyons (born 1951) of Fort Bragg in Mendocino County in northwestern California, Cheryl Lyons Despain (born 1955) of Salt Lake City, Utah, and Blythe Ann Lyons (born 1968 in Lafayette), a veterinarian in Baton Rouge; three sons, Culver Hall Lyons, Sr. (born 1950), of Alpharetta, Georgia, Michael Glen Lyons (born 1958) of Humble, Texas, and Troy Dominic Lyons (born 1965) of Centreville, Mississippi, and two stepsons. Though the senior Lyons and his wife were Episcopalians, Hall Lyons turned Mormon. Services were held at a Latter Day Saints meetinghouse in Shreveport. Burial was in the Lyons family plot at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport. Pallbearers included Lyons' boyhood friend, Republican former State Representative B. F. O'Neal, Jr., of Shreveport and Lyons's son-in-law, Wayne Kent Despain (born 1953).

Since 2008, they have gathered a worldwide following of fans with their passionate music about comic books, movies, video games and fandom. The band has been featured on NPR, \\"The Force-Cast,\\" \\"The Indy-Cast,\\" \\"Fanboy's Guide To The Galaxy,\\" \\"The Star Wars Report,\\" \\"The Star Wars Talk Show,\\" \\"TechnoRetro Dads\\" and have played such high-profile shows as New York Comic Con, Star Wars Celebration, ComiCONN, TerrifiCon, Rhode Island Comic Con and New England Super MegaFest. High Adventure's music has been featured in the soundtrack to the Star Wars documentary The Force Within Us and The Walking Dead documentary The Walkers Among Us. History High Adventure was originally envisioned on May 23, 1984 by childhood friends Glen Nelson and Todd Howard. At the time, they were inspired by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and got the name from a headline in the Hartford Courant about the film. They performed popular songs at the time that they enjoyed, and also wrote original music. The duo played for several years, and expanded to a quartet with other neighborhood friends. However, after Howard moved to a different town, the band was put on hiatus. In 2008, Nelson and Howard teamed up once again to pen the song \\"The Ballad Of Indiana\\" to commemorate the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. On the heels of this musical rebirth came an opportunity to perform live for their growing fans. Mitchell Hallock, co-host of the \\"Indy- Cast\\" and co-promoter of a then-new comic book convention in Connecticut, titled ComiCONN, asked them to perform at the event, which they did, joined by drummer Chris Eddy. At the same time, High Adventure's music was being featured on several high-profile on-line podcasts.Barrick, Mike. A Galaxy Of Music vol. 33 TheForce.net. August 3, 2011 This exposure not only led to a worldwide fanbase, but inspired the band to release their songs as an album. Their 2010 debut album, Acoustic Prog Pop, included songs related to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Batman, and other topics. Following the success of Acoustic Prog Pop, High Adventure's second album, Into a Larger World, was released in 2011. Covering familiar topics as Star Wars and Indiana Jones, it also includes songs inspired by Back to the Future, Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. The album was the first to include guitarist Brian Rabuse. The same year, the group continued playing conventions and made their first appearance at the New York Comic Con. In 2012 the group added several members. John Dotson joined the band on bass guitar following the departure of Todd Howard. Stu Sosnoski also joined on trombone and keyboard.

The result was a victory for the Centralists. Prelude General Antonio Canales and the remaining insurgents that survived the Battle of Morales (25 March) sought refuge in San Antonio, Texas. While official recognition from the Republic of Texas was not obtained, General Canales' tour was met with some success. On the 1 June he arrived in San Patricio, where the rebellion forces had been reorganising. In addition to 300 volunteers, the army had grown to include 140 Texan and 80 Native American volunteers. The Texan volunteers were led by Colonel Samuel Jordan. Battle General Canales sent Colonel Jordan and approximately 90 Texan volunteers south into disputed territory in late June; they crossed the Rio Grande, and took Ciudad Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas, without any resistance. A few of those who were guiding Jordan were still loyal to the Central government of Mexico and were trying to lead the Texans towards San Luis Potos√≠, where a Mexican ambush awaited. Jordan suspected such and diverted his troops to Saltillo, Coahuila, where, on the 25 October he was attacked by Mexican General R√°fael V√°squez. Some of Jordan's soldiers deserted and he was heavily outnumbered, but he was able to defend himself and return to Texas. Aftermath Soon after this defeat Canales capitulated to the Centralists.

Its establishment was supported by Supreme National Committee, a quasi-government for the Poles in Galicia. The Legion was established upon order of the Headquarters of Imperial and Royal Army, on 27 August 1914. According to the order, it consisted of two infantry regiments (each divided into two battalions with 1000 volunteers), and two or three cavalry squadrons (150 men in each). Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen named Major Adam Pietraszkiewicz commandant of the Legion, while his chief of staff was Captain Dionizy Jasienicki. Eastern Legion was based on volunteers, most of whom were members of different Polish paramilitary organizations, such as Sokol, Druzyny Bartoszowe and Polish Rifle Squads from the area of Lw√≥w. Due to rapid Russian advance into Galicia (see Battle of Galicia), the Legion was on 29 August evacuated to Mszana Dolna, via Sambor, Chyr√≥w, Sanok and Jas≈Ço. During the evacuation, which was organized by Count Aleksander Skarbek, the number of its soldiers grew to over 6200. For unknown reasons, Adam Pietraszkiewicz did not become commandant of the Legion, so his post was offered to Captain Dionizy Jasienicki. Count Skarbek, who was a very influential person in Galicia, opposed this promotion, and as a result, on 14 September Captain J√≥zef Haller became the new commandant of Eastern Legion. Five days later, the Legion arrived at Mszana Dolna. Eastern Legion was dissolved on 21 September 1914. Most of its volunteers refused to swear allegiance and obedience to the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria: only 800 soldiers, most of whom came from Podhale and the Duchy of Teschen, led by J√≥zef Haller and Jan Kozicki, agreed to swear allegiance to Franz Joseph. Out of these soldiers, 3rd Legions Infantry Regiment was created. The regiment swore the oath on 26 September.

He is regarded as one of the most gifted botanical painters of the 16th century.Thomas Gloning, Lydia Kaiser und Ans Schapendonk, Rembert Dodoens und sein Cruyde Boeck (1563) in: 'Rembert Dodoens, Cruyde Boeck, Antwerpen 1563', UB Marburg, Marburg, 2005, p. 1-73 Pieter van der Borcht the Elder also introduced new themes such as the 'monkey scene' (also called 'singerie') into Northern art. Life Not much is known about Pieter van der Borcht's life. He was born in Mechelen. There are indications that Pieter van der Borcht was likely the son of Jacques van der Borcht. Jacques van der Borcht was an artist who was regarded in 1562 as the dean of the Mechelen Guild of Saint Luke.Pieter van der Borcht at Mechelen MAPT Pieter van der Borcht is recorded in 1564 as working from Mechelen for Christopher Plantin, who operated a famous book printing and publishing enterprise in Antwerp.Pieter van der Borcht at the University of Victoria He supplied Plantin with the drawings for the engravings for many scientific publications of Plantin such as the works of Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius and Matthias de l'Obel.J. G. Van Gelder, Van blompot and blomglas, in: Elsevier's XCI No. 2, p. 73-82 The Tooth Puller While van der Borcht was still living in Mechelen in 1572, the city that had risen against the Spanish occupiers was retaken and sacked by Spanish troops under the Duke of Alva. The plundering of the city lasted for three days. Van der Borcht and his family were able to flee to Antwerp. Here Plantin gave them free lodgings in his own house. A letter of Plantin testifies to the fact that the departure from Mechelen of the van der Borcht family must have been very sudden as on their arrival in Antwerp both parents were sick and their children naked. Van der Borcht would never leave Antwerp where he became a full-time assistant of Plantin. He illustrated many liturgical books published by Plantin, mainly for the Spanish market. He likely became a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1580 and was its dean from 1589 to 1592. Some art historians have questioned that the ‚ÄòPieter Verborcht, painter‚Äô who became a master in the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp in 1580 and served as its dean in 1591 and 1592 was the same as Pieter van der Borcht (I) since it was unlikely that a non- citizen would be allowed to hold this position in the Guild at that time.Jetty E. van der Sterre. \\"Borcht, Pieter van der.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 17 Sep. 2014 Pieter had a son also called Pieter van der Borcht who became an artist. It is not clear whether he is one of the painters active under that name in Brussels. Work Drawing of a Flower, from the 'Libri picturati' The subjects of his work are genre, historical and religious themes.Pieter van der Borcht (I) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History There is some debate as to whether works executed under the name Pieter van der Borcht were made by a single artist or several artists with the same name. The attributed works include a large number of drawings, engravings, etchings and woodcuts, that were mostly used as book illustrations. The themes of these works include biblical and mythological subjects, genre scenes, pictures depicting the months and botanical illustrations. So either the artist was extremely productive and versatile, or anywhere from two to four artists active during that same time cooperated with him in this production. The first published work of art attributed to Pieter van der Borcht (I) was printed in 1552 by Jacob van Liesvelt's son Hans van Liesvelt II in a book written by Frans Vervoort entitled Dat vyants net, der booser wercken raet, visioenen ende met alder sijnder verholender stricken. The book contains 17 woodcut illustrations. The final illustration is an image of the Virgin Mary holding the symbol of the city of Mechelen and was signed \\"Fecit Petrus van der Boercht 1552\\".Andrew Pettegree, Malcolm Walsby, Netherlandish Books (NB) (2 Vols): Books Published in the Low Countries and Dutch Books Printed Abroad Before 1601, BRILL, 2010, p. 1341 In 1564 Pieter van der Borcht made the drawings but not the woodcuts for an emblem book (the Emblemata of Sambucus) for Plantin. This was followed by a commission in 1565 to make 60 drawings of plants for a herbarium written by Rembert Dodoens, the Frumentorum, leguminum, palustrium et aquatilium herbarum historia. Both author and publisher were very happy with the quality of van der Borcht's drawings and he became the regular illustrator for Plantin's numerous botanical books. Van der Borcht made drawings for Clusius' Rariorum aliquot stirpium per Hispanias observatarum historia (1567)(one of the earliest books on Spanish flora), which were cut by Gerard van Kampen. The originals of these drawings are contained in the Libri picturati A. 16-31 held by the Jagiellonian Library of the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w (originally in the former Preussischer Staatsbibliothek of Berlin). The 1.400 drawings are of very high quality.Ram√≥n-Laca Men√©ndez de Luarca, Luis, Las plantas vasculares de la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica en la obra de Clusio: env√≠os de semillas de Sevilla a Leiden Libri picturati A. 16-31 at the Jagiellonian Library of the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w Van der Borcht made more than 3,180 botanical watercolours for Plantin. These drawings were the basis for woodcuts made by three of Plantin‚Äôs regular woodcutters known by name: Arnold Nicola√Ø, and later Gerard van Kampen and Cornelis Muller.Karel A. E. Enenkel, Paulus Johannes Smith, Early Modern Zoology: The Construction of Animals in Science, Literature and the Visual Arts, Volume 7, Issue 1, BRILL, 2007, p. 264 The Nursery, c. 1585, an example of a 'singerie' Pieter van der Borcht later began to engrave his own work. He was one of the first to work in the new medium of copperplate engraving and etching that came into use after 1564. This medium finally replaced woodcuts in most of Plantin's publications. Pieter van der Borcht also designed a number of official printer's marks of Plantin. He may have been responsible for a number of engravings of peasant weddings, country fairs and feasts after the work of contemporary Flemish painters such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder, as well as of mythological and historical subjects.Larry Silver, ‚Äò‚ÄôPeasant Scenes and Landscapes: The Rise of Pictorial Genres in the Antwerp Art Market‚Äô‚Äô, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012, p. 198 Pieter van der Borcht the Elder contributed to the spread of the genre of the 'monkey scene', also called 'singerie' (a word, which in French means a 'comical grimace, behaviour or trick').'Singerie' in Larousse online Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish art in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century. Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists in particular by those in Antwerp such as Frans Francken the Younger, Jan Brueghel the Elder and the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these ‚Äòmonkey scenes‚Äô as well.Bert Schepers, Monkey Madness in Seventeenth-Century Antwerp, in: The Rubenianum Quarterly, 2012 2, p. 5 Some historians question whether the Pieter van der Borcht responsible for this body of work should be identified with Pieter van der Borcht (I).

Palinopsia is a broad term describing a heterogeneous group of symptoms, which is divided into hallucinatory palinopsia and illusory palinopsia. Illusory palinopsia is likely due to sustained awareness of a stimulus and is similar to a visual illusion: the distorted perception of a real external stimulus. Illusory palinopsia is caused by migraines, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), prescription drugs, and head trauma, but is also sometimes idiopathic. Illusory palinopsia consists of afterimages that are short-lived or unformed, occur at the same location in the visual field as the original stimulus, and are often exposed or exacerbated based on environmental parameters such as stimulus intensity, background contrast, fixation, and movement. Illusory palinopsia symptoms occur continuously or predictably, based on environmental conditions. The term is from Greek: palin for \\"again\\" and opsia for \\"seeing\\". Signs and symptoms Illusory palinopsia is often worse with high stimulus intensity and contrast ratio in a dark adapted state. Multiple types of illusory palinopsia often co-exist in a patient and occur with other diffuse, persistent illusory symptoms such as halos around objects, dysmetropsia (micropsia, macropsia, pelopsia, or teleopsia), Alice in Wonderland Syndrome, visual snow, and oscillopsia. Illusory palinopsia consists of the following four symptom categories. =Prolonged indistinct afterimage= Prolonged indistinct afterimages are unformed and occur at the same location in the visual field as the original stimulus. Stimulus intensity, contrast, and fixation length affects the generation and severity of these perseverated images. For example, after seeing a bright light such as a car headlight or a camera flash, a persistent afterimage remains in the visual field for several minutes. Patients often report photophobia, which can restrict their ability to perform outdoor activity. The prolonged image or light is typically isochromatic (positive afterimage) to the original stimulus, but can fade to different colors over time. Afterimages from lights tend to last longer than the indistinct afterimages from other brightly-colored objects. Palinoptic prolonged light afterimages of the complementary color are differentiated from physiological afterimages based on afterimage intensity and duration. =Light streaking= Light streaking describes a comet-like tail which is seen due to motion between a person or a light. The streaking usually persists for several seconds before fading and often occurs with bright lights on a dark background. Patients commonly report of difficulty with night driving since the headlights of oncoming cars cause multiple streaks which obscure vision. =Visual trailing= Visual trailing describes an object in motion leaving frozen copies in its wake. These motion-induced afterimages may be discontinuous such as in a film reel or may be blurred together such as in a long-exposure photograph. If discontinuous, the patient also usually reports akinetopsia. The perseverated images last a few seconds and are usually identical in color and shape to the original stimulus. Most cases describe visual trails during movement of an object, although there are also reports from the movement of the observer's head or eyes. =Variant image perseveration = There are a few cases of palinopsia with many of the same features as hallucinatory palinopsia (formed image perseveration) but with some important differences. The formed perseverated image may only last a couple seconds or may be black or translucent. These variants usually lack the realistic clarity of hallucinatory palinopsia, and the generation of the palinoptic images is affected by fixation time, motion, stimulus intensity, or contrast. These variants probably represent an overlap in hallucinatory and illusory palinopsia but are included in illusory palinopsia since they often co-exist with the other illusory symptoms. Cause Of the published cases of palinopsia that are idiopathic or attributed to migraines, HPPD, prescription drugs, or head trauma, 94% described illusory palinopsia. Trazodone, nefazodone, mirtazapine, topiramate, clomiphene,> oral contraceptives, and risperidone have been reported to cause illusory palinopsia. Clomiphene and oral contraceptives are the only prescription drugs reported to cause permanent symptoms. HPPD is most common after LSD ingestion, but can occur after any hallucinogen use. HPPD is commonly described in psychiatric literature and illusory palinopsia symptoms are sometimes not defined as palinopsia. It is not clear if there is a relationship between HPPD and the quantity and strength of hallucinogen doses taken. Pathophysiology Illusory palinopsia is a dysfunction in visual perception, presumably related to diffuse neuronal excitability alterations in the anterior and posterior visual pathways. Because of the drugs that cause illusory palinopsia, 5-HT2a receptor excitotoxicity or a disruption of GABAnergic transmission have been proposed as possible mechanisms. However, the neuropharmacology of the visual system is probably too complex to pinpoint the visual disturbances to a single neurotransmitter or neurotransmitter receptor. The generation of illusory palinopsia is often dependent on ambient light or motion, and the symptoms could be a pathological exaggeration of normal light perception and motion perception mechanisms. Prolonged indistinct afterimages are symptomatically similar to physiological afterimages, and light streaking and visual trailing are symptomatically similar to motion blur when viewing fast-moving objects. Light and motion perception are dynamic operations involving processing and feedback from structures throughout the central nervous system. A patient frequently has multiple types of diffuse, persistent illusory symptoms which represent dysfunctions in both light and motion perception. Light and motion are processed via different pathways, which suggests that there are diffuse or global excitability alterations in the visual pathway. Faulty neural adaptation and feedback between the anterior and posterior visual pathways could cause persistent excitability changes. Movement-related palinopsia could be due to inappropriate or incomplete activation of the motion suppression mechanisms (visual masking/backward masking and corollary discharges) related to visual stability during eye or body movements, which are present in saccadic suppression, blinking, smooth pursuit, etc. =Palinopsia in migraineurs= Illusory palinopsia may occur during a migraine aura, as do other diffuse illusory symptoms such as halos around objects, visual snow, dysmetropsia, and oscillopsia. In a rare migraine subtype known as persistent visual aura without infarction, illusory palinopsia symptoms (prolonged indistinct afterimages, light streaking, and visual trailing) persist after the migraine has abated. Alternatively, up to 10% of all migraineurs report of formed afterimages that only last a couple seconds and do not occur with other illusory symptoms. These momentary afterimages appear at a different location in the visual field than the original stimulus, occur a few times per month, and are affected by external light and motion. (variant image perseveration). Migraineurs with these momentary afterimages report significantly fewer migraine headaches than migraineurs without these afterimages (4.3 vs. 14.4 attacks/year). These afterimages probably represent an overlap in hallucinatory and illusory palinopsia. Studying these momentary formed afterimages, in relation to alterations in cortical excitability, could advance our understanding of migraine pathogenesis and mechanisms associated with encoding visual memory. Diagnosis Palinopsia necessitates a full ophthalmologic and neurologic history and physical exam. There are no clear guidelines on the work-up for illusory palinopsia, but it is not unreasonable to order automated visual field testing and neuroimaging since migraine aura can sometimes mimic seizures or cortical lesions. However, in a young patient without risk factors or other worrisome symptoms or signs (vasculopathy, history of cancer, etc.), neuroimaging for illusory palinopsia is low-yield but may grant the patient peace of mind. The physical exam and work-up are usually non-contributory in illusory palinopsia. Diagnosing the etiology of illusory palinopsia is often based on the clinical history. Palinopsia is attributed to a prescription drug if symptoms begin after drug initiation or dose increase. Palinopsia is attributed to head trauma if symptoms begin shortly after the incident. Continuous illusory palinopsia in a migraineur is usually from persistent visual aura. HPPD can occur any time after hallucinogen ingestion and is a diagnosis of exclusion in patients with previous hallucinogen use. Migraines and HPPD are probably the most common causes of palinopsia. Idiopathic palinopsia may be analogous to the cerebral state in persistent visual aura with non-migraine headache or persistent visual aura without headache. Due to the subjective nature of the symptoms and the lack of organic findings, clinicians may be dismissive of illusory palinopsia, sometimes causing the patient distress. There is considerable evidence in the literature confirming the symptom legitimacy, so validating the patient‚Äôs symptoms can help ease anxiety. Unidirectional visual trails or illusory symptoms confined to part of a visual field suggest cortical pathology and necessitate further work-up. Treatment There is limited data on treating the visual disturbances associated with HPPD, persistent visual aura, or post-head trauma visual disturbances, and pharmaceutical treatment is empirically-based. It is not clear if the etiology or type of illusory symptom influences treatment efficacy. Since the symptoms are usually benign, treatment is based on the patient‚Äôs zeal and willingness to try many different drugs. There are cases which report successful treatment with clonidine, clonazepam, lamotrigine, nimodipine, topiramate, verapamil, divalproex sodium, gabapentin, furosemide, and acetazolamide, as these drugs have mechanisms that decrease neuronal excitability. However, other patients report treatment failure from the same drugs. Based on the available evidence and side-effect profile, clonidine might be an attractive treatment option. Many patients report improvement from sunglasses. FL-41 tinted lenses may provide additional relief, as they have shown some efficacy in providing relief to visually- sensitive migraineurs.

Palinopsia is a broad term describing a group of symptoms which is divided into hallucinatory palinopsia and illusory palinopsia. Hallucinatory palinopsia refers to the projection of an already-encoded visual memory and is similar to a complex visual hallucination: the creation of a formed visual image where none exists. Hallucinatory palinopsia usually arises from posterior cortical lesions or seizures and can be the presenting symptom of a serious neurological disease. Hallucinatory palinopsia describes afterimages or scenes that are formed, long-lasting, high resolution, and isochromatic. The palinoptic images are not typically reliant on environmental parameters and often present with homonymous visual field deficits. Hallucinatory palinopsia occurs unpredictably and the persistent images can appear anywhere in the visual field, regardless of the location of the original stimulus. A patient will often have only a few episodes of hallucinatory palinopsia. Visual perseveration is synonymous with palinopsia. The term is from Greek: palin for \\"again\\" and opsia for \\"seeing\\". Signs and symptoms Hallucinatory palinopsia consists of the following four symptom categories. A person often reports symptoms from multiple categories. =Formed image perseveration= Formed image perseveration refers to a single, stationary object that remains fixed in one's visual field. These pathological afterimages look realistic and have the same color and clarity as the original stimulus. The palinopsia lasts at least 15 seconds, but may persist for hours or days. For example, a patient sees a cat, and an identical copy of the cat remains fixed in the field of view for 30 minutes. A patient commonly complains of the perseverated fingers of an examiner. These afterimages often occur in visual field deficits but may occur anywhere in the visual field, regardless of the location of the original stimulus. The generation of the afterimages is not affected by external conditions such as the length of fixation, stimulus intensity, contrast, or motion. The palinoptic image can appear immediately after seeing the original image or may be delayed in time. =Scene perseveration= Scene perseveration refers to seeing a previously-viewed, short stereotyped scene that continuously replays for several minutes. For example, a patient might view a person throwing a ball, and then an hour later, perceives the same action sequence repeated many times. The palinoptic scene usually has the same color and clarity as the original. Our understanding of visual memory considers a short scene as a unit of memory, similar to an image, thus scene perseveration is probably mechanistically related to formed image perseveration. =Categorical incorporation= Categorical incorporation refers to seeing an object or feature and superimposing it onto comparable objects or people. For example, after seeing a person wearing a hat, that same hat is seen on each subsequent person seen. Or a person sees the spire of a building and then incorporates it to the top of other structures seen. The palinoptic images have the same characteristics as the original stimulus, and episodes of categorical incorporation usually last a few minutes. Categorical incorporation highlights the brain's use of constructs to process stimuli. =Patterned visual spread= Patterned visual spread describes the spread of a pattern in a field of view. For example, a patient sees a checkered pattern on a lamp, which then contiguously spreads to objects such as the floor or a desk. Contextual clues do not influence patterned visual spread, distinguishing it from categorical incorporation. Cause Of the published cases of palinopsia from posterior cortical lesions or seizures, 93% described hallucinatory palinopsia. Hallucinatory palinopsia may be caused by many types of posterior cortical lesions such as neoplasms, infarctions, hemorrhages, arteriovenous malformations, aneurysm, abscesses, and tuberculomas. Hallucinatory palinopsia from seizures may be secondary to a focal cortical lesion or may be secondary to a non-structural disturbance. Causes of seizures that are reported to cause palinopsia include metabolic disturbances (hyperglycemia, carnitine deficiency), ion channel disturbances, Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease, and seizures of unknown cause. Pathophysiology Hallucinatory palinopsia is a dysfunction of visual memory, caused by localized cortical hyperexcitability or hyperactivity in the posterior visual pathway. Post-geniculate cortical lesions or seizures may cause cortical deafferentation, focal cortical irritation, and epileptic discharges, the proposed mechanisms of hallucinatory palinopsia. =Cortical deafferentation= Palinopsia can occur from posterior visual pathway (post-geniculate) deafferentation, which causes homonymous visual field deficits. This mechanism is thought to be similar to the deafferentation hyperexcitability seen in visual release hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome), which are distinguished from palinopsia by whether the formed image or scene previously occurred. It is hypothesized that deafferentation hyperexcitability is the cause of neuropathic pain. Molecular changes from deafferentation include an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles and heightened post-synaptic receptor sensitivity. =Epileptic discharges= Palinopsia from epileptic discharges, confirmed by electroencephalogram, have been reported during a seizure aura, during the seizure, or post-ictally. The seizures can originate anywhere in the posterior visual pathway, depending on the location of the pathology. Palinoptic seizures rarely generalize, and there are case reports of palinopsia as the only symptom of a visual seizure. If seizures are persistent, then continual palinoptic episodes often occur. =Focal cortical irritation= Palinopsia, which occurs after neurosurgical procedures or cerebrovascular accidents, has been partly attributed to focal cortical irritation. Symptoms are associated with perilesional hyperperfusion, which may reflect focal cortical instability and subsequent hyperactivity. While there are reports of palinopsia from each individual mechanism, there is usually a combination of the aforementioned mechanisms. For example, hallucinatory palinopsia may present in a patient with seizure symptoms and visual field deficits, after a neurosurgical procedure. This suggests that the cortical hyperactivity from each mechanism is additive. \\"Hallucinatory palinopsia, once considered a disorder of the nondominant parieto-occipital lobe, has since been shown to occur from lesions in the dominant or non-dominant temporal, parietal, or occipital lobes. ‚Ä¶ The predominance of lesions in certain cortical areas is more likely due to the uneven distribution or functional variation of visual cortex-hippocampal neurons. ... All of the hallucinatory palinopsia symptoms occur concomitantly in a patient with one lesion, which supports current evidence that objects, features, and scenes are all units of visual memory, perhaps at different levels of processing. This alludes to neuroanatomical integration in visual memory creation and storage.\\" Diagnosis Palinopsia necessitates a full ophthalmologic and neurologic history and physical exam. Hallucinatory palinopsia warrants automated visual field testing and neuroimaging since the majority of hallucinatory palinopsia is caused by posterior cortical lesions and seizures. It is generally easy to diagnose the underlying cause of hallucinatory palinopsia. The medical history typically includes concerning symptoms, and neuroimaging usually reveals cortical lesions. In patients with hallucinatory palinopsia and unremarkable neuroimaging, blood tests or clinical history often hints at the cause. The practitioner should be considering visual seizures in these cases. Treatment Palinopsia from cerebrovascular accidents generally resolves spontaneously, and treatment should be focused on the vasculopathic risk factors. Palinopsia from neoplasms, AVMs, or abscesses require treatment of the underlying condition, which usually also resolves the palinopsia. Palinopsia due to seizures generally resolves after correcting the primary disturbance and/or treating the seizures. In persistent hallucinatory palinopsia, a trial of an anti- epileptic drug can be attempted. Anti-epileptics reduce cortical excitability and could potentially treat palinopsia caused by cortical deafferentation or cortical irritation. Patients with idiopathic hallucinatory palinopsia should have close follow-up.

A son, Henry Hamilton (6 January 1826 ‚Äì 10 February 1907), remained in England, where he was a student at a Christ's Hospital bluecoat school, then emigrated aboard Christina in 1841 and for two years worked on a sheep station near Burra. He purchased a property in Oaklands adjoining his father's property, built a house and settled there. He inherited his father's Glenelg property, but it was disposed of within his lifetime. He suffered from ill-health in his later years, and handed over management of Ewell Vineyards, to his son F E \\"Frank\\" Hamilton (5 February 1859 ‚Äì 13 June 1913) in 1890. Frank served on Marion Council for many years. Ewell Vineyards at this time covered , as well as groves of almonds and other fruit. Frank married Violet Ayliffe (1 February 1875 ‚Äì 1 February 1865) on 17 September 1895. She was a granddaughter of Dr. George Hamilton Ayliffe. Their eldest son (Frank) Eric Hamilton (4 July 1896 ‚Äì May 1967) took over management of the company, with Sydney (18 July 1898 ‚Äì 22 July 1987), another son, as winemaker. They rebuilt the winery and installed a distillery. They restructured the company as Hamilton's Ewell Vineyards Pty. Ltd. in 1934. Eric's son Robert (27 May 1926 ‚Äì 8 January 1976) became chairman of directors in 1967. The wines Hamiltons Ewell vineyards were planted with red (Grenache) and white (Pedro Ximenes) wine grapes for wines they marketed as Chablis and Moselle. In 1841 the vineyard produced South Australia's first commercial wine. With the installation of pot stills they were able to specialize in fortified wines, notably Sauterne, and brandy. In 1958 the company purchased the Bridgewater Mill (built for John Dunn), which they used for maturation of their table wines and as a bond store for brandy spirit. Petaluma Wines purchased the Mill in 1986. Demise of the original Ewell vineyards From the 1950s, with the spread of suburban Adelaide, the company sold off large swathes of land, much to the South Australian Housing Trust for \\"austerity housing\\". In 1968 was compulsorily acquired for creation of Glengowrie High School, which closed and was demolished in 1991 to make way for a retirement estate. The school body was amalgamated with Mitchell Park High to form Hamilton Secondary College. Another was assumed in 1975 for the MTT bus depot. The section \\"Laffer's Triangle\\" which they had purchased from the Laffer family, was leased to Flinders University, then sold to the South Australian Government and now includes the Sturt police station. By the turn of the 21st Century, only a few tiny patches of vines remained on Oaklands Road, maintained by the Marion Council, and in \\"Laffers Triangle\\", for twenty years overrun with wild olive trees, and subsequently involved as a construction site for the Darlington Upgrade Project. The company purchased land for vineyards at Happy Valley, Springton, Eden Valley, Nildottie, and Wood Wood, near Swan Hill, and continues to make wines in South Australia, under Mark Hamilton, a member of the sixth-generation of South Australian Hamiltons.

MV-NIS will attach and fuse to host tumor cell membranes. After fusion, MV-NIS has been observed to kill the tumor cells. Due to the unique properties of iodine uptake in these cells, iodine 123 (I-123) may be used to image MV-NIS-infected tumor cells. Non-invasive imaging provides confirmation of targeted infection and allows for monitoring and visualization of treatment progression. The human CD46 antigen is known to be the functional cellular receptor for Measles virus. This type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein is a normal part of human tissue but may be overexpressed on some cancer cell types. MV-NIS is the first targeted engineered virus therapy to have shown remission in published cancer clinical trials. PET/CT Imaging A few days after infection, the host animal may be injected with radioiodine which is then selectively captured by infected cells and tumors. Detailed images may then be created showing the location of these infections and the target sites for tumor reduction monitoring. In the mouse model, non-invasive imaging and selective uptake have assisted in evidence for selective prostate cancer treatment. This imaging technique is an improvement over initial efforts to engineer a Measles virus to carry the soluble marker human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The resultant strain, MV-CEA, could only be monitored by blood test which is not specific to areas of treatment.

It is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia and has research facilities in Warminster, Pennsylvania. The company was formerly known as Tekmira, which was spun out of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2007. History Tekmira, as the company was formerly called, was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Inex Pharmaceuticals in 2005 after that company began collapsing after its regulatory and partnering strategy failed in 2004. Tekmira was fully spun out in 2007 and Tekmira absorbed the assets of Inex, which had been founded in 1992. Inex had been developing liposomal formulations of off-patent cancer drugs, and licensed them to Talon Pharmaceuticals in 2005; Talon was acquired by Spectrum Pharmaceuticals in 2013, and three former Inex/Tekmira products reached the market and began generating royalties for Tekmira: Marqibo (liposomal vincristine), Alocrest (liposomal vinorelbine) and Brakiva (liposomal topotecan). Inex had also acquired licenses to intellectual property, as well as staff and manufacturing facilities, concerning RNAi technology from Lynx Therapeutics in 1998; this set of technologies became the focus for Tekmira and it initially sought to develop liposomally encapsulated RNAi drugs for a broad range of indications. Tekmira also worked on providing liposomal delivery technology to other companies. In 2007 it signed a license agreement with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals so that Alnylam could use it to deliver its own RNAi drugs; that deal was expanded into a manufacturing agreement in 2009. Most of those products not focused on viral diseases faltered, and Tekmira had only $6.3 million in cash when it filed suit against Alnylam in 2011 for breaching its contract and stealing trade secrets. The suit was settled in 2012, with Alnylam agreeing to pay Tekmira $65 million in termination fees, and the companies negotiated a new license agreement with lower milestones and royalties, which covers Alnylam's product patisiran. Tekmira caught the world's attention and its stock rose dramatically during the 2013 West African Ebola virus epidemic due to its drug candidate for Ebola fever, TKM-Ebola. Tekmira was developing it under a $140 million US Department of Defense contract. While its stock was trading high in January 2015, it acquired OnCore BioPharma, a company focused on hepatitis B. Development of TKM-Ebola was terminated in mid June 2015 during a Phase II trial, for lack of efficacy. The next month, Tekmira changed its name to Arbutus Biopharma and said that it would focus on drugs to treat hepatitis B. In March 2017 Arbutus signed another license for its liposome delivery technology, this time with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, for delivery of an mRNA drug candidate. This license was terminated in July 2017, when Alexion discontinued preclinical programs outside its core complement franchise. In 2019, Arbutus began a phase 1 clinical study using AB-506 to treat chronic hepatitis B. The company released preliminary data in July and stopped the trial in October after two patients developed acute hepatitis. In July 2019, Arbutus Biopharma announced the sale of part of its royalty interest on future global net sales of ONPATTRO, an RNA interference therapeutic currently sold by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, to OMERS for $20 million.

Heathcote was born into a gentry family in 1779, the youngest son of a baronet. He and a brother entered the navy, with Gilbert reaching officer rank during the French Revolutionary Wars. He was promoted to his first command early in the Napoleonic Wars, but his ship was wrecked in a gale. His career survived largely unscathed however, and he commanded several more ships, reaching the rank of post-captain during a period of service in the East Indies, before his health obliged him to return to Britain. He undertook a final spell of active service in the closing years of the Napoleonic Wars in command of a frigate, before retiring ashore, and dying in 1831. Family and early life Heathcote was born in 1779, the youngest son of Sir William Heathcote, 3rd Baronet and his wife, Frances. William Heathcote was Member of Parliament for Hampshire between 1790 and 1806, and had his seat, Hursley House, in that county. Gilbert's elder brother Henry, Sir William's fourth son, was also a naval officer, and would rise to the rank of admiral of the blue. Gilbert Heathcote joined the navy, and after some years of service, was promoted to lieutenant on 10 December 1799. A further promotion to master and commander came on 29 April 1802, and in 1803 he was appointed to command the 14-gun brig-sloop HMS Suffisante, taking over from Commander Christopher Nesham. Suffisante outfitted at Plymouth between July and September 1803, after which Heathcote took her to sea. His first command was short-lived; Suffisante was caught in a heavy gale, and wrecked on Spike Island, off Queenstown on 25 December 1803. Heathcote underwent a customary court-martial for the loss, at which he was reprimanded but not punished. Further commands Heathcote's career does not appear to have been unduly affected by the loss of Suffisante, and by September 1804 he was in command of , the guardship at Lymington. He left her in January 1805 and appears to have been without a ship until he undertook a period of service in the East Indies. He was promoted to post-captain on 25 September 1806 and succeeded to the command of the 38-gun , replacing Commander Hood Hanway Christian, who had commissioned her in 1805. Heathcote's health seems to have broken down while on this situation, as he left Sir Edward Hughes later that September to return to Britain, and was reported by The Asiatic Annual Register to be \\"returning to Europe for the benefit of his health.\\" Commander Edward Ratsey, formerly of the 18-gun brig-sloop , was appointed to replace Heathcote. Heathcote's health had improved by 1813 to allow him to return to active service with the command of the newly built 36-gun , which he took over in October that year. Heathcote was assigned to service in the English Channel, and was in command until mid-1815, when command passed to Captain John Lewis. Heathcote does not appear to have had any further active service. He married Ann Lyell at Southampton on 23 March 1809, and at some point had his portrait painted by William Owen. He died, still at the rank of post-captain, on 22 April 1831.  Notes  a. The promotion and appointment of Ratsey to command Sir Edward Hughes created a vacancy for the command of the Harrier. The commander in chief of that part of the East Indies Station, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet, filled it by promoting his son Edward, formerly a lieutenant on his father's flagship , to the rank of commander, and giving him the Harrier. This proved to be a fortunate appointment for Edward, as the Blenheim disappeared in a gale the following year with the loss of Sir Thomas and her entire crew. b. The Scots Magazine names her as Ann, John Marshall's Royal Naval Biography instead has Anne. Both describe her as the daughter of the late Charles Lyell, of Kinnordy, Angus. She was therefore the sister of Charles Lyell the elder, the botanist. Owen's portrait of Heathcote is now held in the collections of Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

Hudson discussed and illustrated the species under this name in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The lectotype of this species is held at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1973 D. E. Gaskin placed A. strophaea within the genus Culladia. This placement is currently under debate and is regarded by some scientists as erroneous. As a result this species is also referred to as Argyria (s.l.) strophaea or alternatively by its original name despite the later also being regarded as erroneous. Description Meyrick described this species as follows: Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. This species can be found in the North Island as well as in the provinces of Nelson and Westland in the South Island. Other than the type locality of Wellington, this species has also been found at Whakarewarewa, Raurimu, Whanganui, Haruru falls in the Bay of Islands, Lake Taupo, Bluff Hill in Napier, and at Lake Rotorua. Biology and behaviour Larvae of this species have been found in soil. This species is on the wing in January. Specimens of this species have been collected with mercury vapour light traps and 15watt UV light traps. Alfred Philpott studied the male genitalia of this species in 1929.

Nathan Ballantyne and E.J. Coffman define the view as follows: : Conciliationism: In a revealed peer disagreement over P, each thinker should give at least some weight to her peer‚Äôs attitude. That is, each thinker‚Äôs confidence should change to some extent: neither thinker is justified in staying exactly as confident as she initially was regarding whether P. Philosopher David Christensen has been a prominent defender of this view. Others have argued in its favor as well. Some have discussed the implications of this view for religious belief. A standard objection is that conciliationism is self-undermining because most philosophers don't accept it. A number of responses have been offered. A second objection is that if a person encounters multiple people who disagree, and applies conciliationism serially, the procedure violates commutativity. The order that the person encounters the other people affects her resultant doxastic state. Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson have argued that many disagreements are \\"dishonest\\" because in the face of peer disagreement, people typically favor their own positions for various reasons. This stands in contrast to results like Aumann's agreement theorem suggesting they should update their beliefs in each other's directions.

(1937‚Äì1949) were American piano manufacturers of uprights, grands, players, and reproducing grands.  History  1901 Straube Cabinet Grand in a house (c. 1901, Bellingham, Washington) ; Market perspective The years 1875 to 1932 were a golden age of piano making, a time when pianos had few competitors for home entertainment. Straube manufactured pianos for the last thirty-seven of those years. Industry-wide, nearly 364,545 pianos sold in the United States at the peak in 1909, according to the National Piano Manufacturers Association. By comparison, in 2011, 41,000 were sold, along with 120,000 digital pianos and 1.1 million keyboards, according to Music Trades magazine. The Straube Piano Company had its own golden era, from about 1904 to 1935, from several perspectives. The company flourished as an innovator of player pianos, rapidly grew into a high-volume producer of premium and affordable pianos, and earned acclaim for its concert grands. Straube Piano Company developed influential business models based on innovative management, promotion, advertising, and pricing. Its company executives and plant superintendents, particularly E.R. Jacobson (president) and William G. Betz (superintendent and inventor/innovator), were influential industry exponents who held leadership roles in industry organizations. The company produced premium pianos under the Straube name‚Äîbut also manufactured Hammond, Gilmore, and Woodward brands, some of which sold at lower prices, but were still of high quality. It distributed all models nationally, and its players internationally, particularly in Australia. ; Founders ‚Äì Van Matre & Straube The Straube Piano Company was the outgrowth of Van Matre & Straube (aka Straube & Van Matre), a partnership formalized in February 1895 by Williard Naramore Van Matre, Sr. (1851‚Äì1939), and William Straube (n√© Straub;\\"The Name of Straube\\", Vol. 33, No. 8, August 24, 1901, pg. 12 1857‚Äì1928). That same month, Van Matre and Straube leased a factory near Chicago at Downers Grove, Illinois, on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, at the present intersection of Warren and Forest Avenues. The original wareroom was at 24 Adams Street, Chicago. Straube manufactured its first piano in June 1895 at that factory, which was also the factory of Van Matre & Co. W.N. Van Matre & Co. was a music dealer at 105 State Street in Rockford, Illinois. Around July 1896, Van Matre and Straube dissolved the partnership, after Straube purchased Van Matre's share. Straube continued the business under his own name. ; Alternate founding years attributed to the Straube Piano Company 1901 Straube Cabinet Grand with a engraving \\"ESTABLISHED 1878\\". In 1907, Straube Piano Company executives publicly recognized 1895 as the founding year. However, in 1911, Alfred Dolge published an influential reference book, Pianos and Their Makers, that gave 1878 as the founding year. The December 19, 1914, issue of Music Trade Review began using the 1878 founding date. At some point, Straube Piano began casting the numerals \\"1878\\" in the piano plates (aka iron frames). Straube Piano in 1924 attributed 1879 as the founding year. In 1996, a book author provided 1859 as the founding year. ; Incorporation of Straube Piano Company William Straube, an investor, not a piano expert, incorporated Straube Piano Company in 1897 as an Illinois entity. ; Initial executives James (Jim) Francis Broderick (19 August 1854 Philadelphia ‚Äì 17 November 1920 Chicago) became president on January 1, 1898, and served in that role until March 1911. Before joining Straube Piano, Broderick had been a traveling salesman for Steger & Company and the B. Shoninger Co. William Straube (1857‚Äì1923) had sold all his interest around 1901 and signed a 5-year non-compete agreement. But in 1901, Straube, his two brothers, Herman Charles Straube (1867‚Äì1921) and Martin Straube, Jr. (1869‚Äì1934), and an associate, Charles Jacobsen (no relation to the Jacobsons of Straube Piano Company), formed another piano manufacturing company and leased the Club Block in Downers Grove, Illinois. The Straube Piano Company challenged and won an injunction on December 16, 1901, in Cook County Circuit Court forbidding the Straubes and Jacobsen from using the Straube name in the manufacturing of pianos. Ernfrid (Ernest) Reinholdt Jacobson (25 December 1877 Gothenburg, Sweden ‚Äì 19 June 1976 Chicago) ‚Äì who began at Straube in August 1898 as a bookkeeper and stenographer ‚Äì purchased the entire interest of the remaining partner and became president in March 1911. In 1901, Straube Piano Company was one of 31 Chicago area piano manufacturers that were recognized nationally. ; New factory, Hammond, Indiana Straube Piano Factory, Hammond, Indiana, 1904 In 1904, the Straube Piano Company moved its manufacturing and executive offices from Chicago to a newly built piano factory in Hammond, Indiana ‚Äì in the Calumet Region ‚Äì on five acres served by the Monon and the Chicago, Cincinnati & Louisville railways. The new factory was custom designed and owned by the company. It was a 3-story facility, with a basement, with 34,000 sq. ft. of factory space. The exterior of the building was a light gray colored brick, made in Michigan City, Indiana, known as Oehlmacher brick. The factory was of mill construction. The main structure was 160 x 50 feet, two stories high. The engine house was 50 x 35 feet, detached, and the boiler house was 60 x 45 feet and detached. The Monon dry kiln was 35 x 65 feet and held 20,000 feet of lumber over six days. It had shipping facilities. And it was equipped with automatic fire doors and fire walls. It had standpipes throughout the structure with separate hose attachments and concrete floors in the basement engine and boiler rooms. At full capacity, the new factory required 200 employees and was capable of producing 3,000 finished pianos a year. Straube Piano introduced its first player piano in November 1909. ; Straube Piano under the leadership of E.R. Jacobson After initially purchasing a small interest in the company, Ernfrid Reinholdt Jacobson became secretary, and continued to acquire stock from time to time. When Ernfrid Reinholdt Jacobson became president in March 1911, he appointed his brothers as executives: Charles (Carl) Herman Jacobson Thorby (1875‚Äì1946), vice-president; and James Frithiof Jacobson (1885‚Äì1968), secretary, who all became owners and were actively involved with the further development of the business. According to Fred E. Cooper, contributor to the Presto-Times, prior to E.R. Jacobson presidency, the Straube Piano Company was just an ordinary piano manufacturer. But under Jacobson and his associates, Struabe Piano became one of the most successful contenders in the high quality piano field. ; Third addition to the factory In 1913, construction began on the 3rd addition to the original Straube factory erected in 1904 at 205 Manila Avenue. On January 30, 1930, the Hammond City Council enacted dozens of street name changes ‚Äì including the change from Manila Avenue to Wildwood Street. The architect was J.T. Hutton (Joseph T. Hutton; 1861‚Äì1932) and the contractor was Mahlon Abraham Dickover (1856‚Äì1932) ; Straube re-incorporates in Indiana In late 1914 or early 1915: The Straube Piano Company was incorporated in Indiana by E.R. Jacobson, J.F. Jacobson, and C.H.J. Thorby with $150,000 () capital stock. Around that time, the factory was producing about 12 finished pianos a day worth about three- quarters of a million dollars a year () and employed about one hundred and fifty men, paying them combined wages of about $125,000 () a year. ; 1916 Around 1916, the Straube Piano Company was manufacturing ten to twelve finished units a day. ; Record monthly production The company reached a new all-time high monthly production volume in November 1922, surpassing its previous monthly high in March 1920. It has been estimated that, of the some 360,000 pianos produced in America in 1909, 56% were players. ; Fifth addition to the factory In 1925, construction began on the fifth and largest addition to the original Straube factory. The architect was J.T. Hutton & Son, the son being William Sturgeon Hutton (1890‚Äì1975). The structure was four stories with a basement. The new addition was devoted largely to the manufacturer of grand and re-producing grand pianos.\\"Begin New Addition to Big Piano Plant\\", Gary Evening Times, Vol. 18, No. 209, February 23, 1925, pg. 1 June 1925, Straube moved into the new plant. The new plant added 70,000 square feet of manufacturing space and provided a suite of new executive offices. The total floor-space, including the addition, was about a hundred and sixty thousand square feet. The new space was especially designed for a new unit that could produce 2,500 Straube grands a year to meet demand. William G. Betz ‚Äì Straube's plant superintendent since 1917, piano design engineer, and inventor who was highly regarded by the industry ‚Äì had spent several years perfecting the construction and design of the new Straube grands. Straube also hired William David McIlwrath (n√© McIlwraith; 1872‚Äì1931), a veteran piano factory superintendent and piano engineer with years of experience in the production of grands, to take charge a department in the new unit. McIlwrath had been the manufacturing superintendent of Jesse French & Sons Piano Co. of New Castle, Indiana, since February 16, 1920, and had been employed there since 1913. McIlwrath learned the profession in Canada, having been associated with many of the leading factories in the East. ; Straube enters radio manufacturing In 1929, Straube began producing radios. ; 1930 advertising In 1930, Straube was using the advertising firm of Lamport, Fox & Co., Irvin Sylvester Dolk (1891‚Äì1981), ad executive of South Bend, Indiana. ; 1935 friendly receivership Sales of pianos and player pianos, industry-wide, began to slip in the early 1920s, due partly to the rising popularity of radio as an alternative for home entertainment and due partly to the rising popularity of automobiles, which cost about the same as premium Straube pianos ($325; ). And, like pianos, automobiles were commonly purchased on installment. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and into the Great Depression, sales declined further and Straube began to struggle financially. In 1925, 80% of pianos sold by the retail trade were done so on installment plans. In an attempt to survive, the Straube Piano Company sold its Hammond factory in 1931 to the J.L. Metz Furniture Co. for $125,000 () and leased back a large portion of the building. In May 1934, the Straube Piano Company went into a friendly receivership. Roy Francis McPharlin (1893‚Äì1980) was appointed as receiver. On January 4, 1935, McPharlin distributed a \\"first and final\\" dividend of 8/10 of 1 cent of one dollar (i.e., 86¬¢ for $100) to the creditors. During the summer of 1935, the company reorganized. By then, it was still producing pianos, but occupied only a portion of the factory it once owned. The remainder of the plant was occupied by J.L. Metz Furniture Co. In 1935, the Straube Piano Company was being operated by the Fidelity Security Company, John Leonard Keilman (1867‚Äì1946), president. Fidelity Security was the finance arm of Straube Piano ‚Äì dealing in piano paper and other securities. When Straube went into receivership, all of its officers departed, including E.R. Jacobson, president; C.H.J. Thorby, vice-president; and Alfred Theodore Schuldes (1892‚Äì1981), secretary-treasurer. Also, in 1935, William G. Betz (1871‚Äì1957), longtime superintendent with over 50 patents, left the company. In the interim, after the departure of Betz and before the appointment of Charles Henry Bartolomee as plant superintendent, Alvin Detloff Meyer (1879‚Äì1970), a Straube purchasing agent and longtime employee, took charge of manufacturing. Around June 1936, Straube Piano Company moved its offices from the First Trust Building in Hammond to the Straube factory at 5049 Columbia Avenue in Hammond. And its board of directors elected Lemuel (Lem) Kline (1868‚Äì1945) as secretary-treasurer. ; 1937 adjudicated bankruptcy : On January 19, 1937, the Straube Piano Company was adjudicated bankrupt in United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, Hammond Division. In March 1937, the receiver for the Straube Piano Company sold all remaining assets for $4,655 () to individuals who planned to continue the business. The dividend amount is not known. The assets consisted of the name and goodwill of the business, unfinished pianos ‚Äì about twenty in process of construction ‚Äì thirty piano cases unassembled, and various supplies of finished and unfinished materials and parts used in the construction of pianos, along with piano strings and wire and other parts for piano manufacturing. ; Reorganization A new company was formed in Indiana on March 27, 1937, as Straube Pianos Inc. located at 5049 Columbia Avenue and production of Straube pianos resumed in the leased portion of the Hammond factory that the former company once owned. The 1937 executives were : Walter Ernst Schrage (1912‚Äì1982), president, whose father, William Ernst Schrage (1884‚Äì1941), was president of the Bank of Whiting, Hammond, Indiana : Max B. Pattiz (1890‚Äì1979), vice-president and general manager (former president of Lauter Piano Company, maker of the Lauter-Humana player piano, Newark, New Jersey) : Harry E. Powers (1899‚Äì1954), secretary and treasurer; Powers was a lawyer from nearby Whiting, Indiana ; 1940 move to Chicago On May 1, 1940, Straube Pianos Inc. moved to Chicago Heights to occupy 48,000 sq. ft. of a warehouse owned by National Tea. :; 1940 executives : Walter Ernst Schrage, Jr., president : Charles Henry Bartholomee (1874‚Äì1960), who began as superintendent in 1935 and became Vice President of Straube Pianos Inc. in July 1940 : Penfield Emory Mason (1875‚Äì1963), sales manager (sales manager many years with the Haddorff Co.) : Charles Roy Arnold (born 1900), Atlanta manager (later, president) of Continental Music Inc., a division of C.G. Conn :; 1941 executives''' : Charles Henry Bartholomee, vice president Straube Pianos Inc. : Herbert A. Koehlinger (1902‚Äì1955), vice president and New York manager (Eastern Manager of the Continental Music Co.); Koehlinger later was sales manager of the Fred Gretsch Manufacturing Company : Paul M. Gazlay (1896‚Äì1966), president of Continental Music Inc.; Gazlay was president of C.G. Conn from 1949 to 1958 ; Sale of Straube to C.G. Conn C.G. Conn acquired Straube Pianos Inc. in October 1941. For the previous two years, Continental Music Co. of Chicago ‚Äì a subsidiary of Conn ‚Äì had been the sales representative for Straube, with P. E. Mason as sales manager. Mason, in the mid-1920s, had been vice president of the Cable-Nelson Piano Company before it had merged with the Everett Piano Company in 1926. C.G. Conn extended the relationship with Continental and kept Bartholomee as the head of manufacturing. Mason, who for many years had been the sales manager for the Haddorff Piano Co., Rockford, Illinois, joined Continental when C.G. Conn acquired Haddorff in November 1940. ; World War II Sometime before May 12, 1942, the U.S. War Production Board restricted piano production by C.G. Conn, Ltd., to 120 pianos a month. On May 12, 1942, C.G. Conn, Ltd., announced that it would consolidate its piano manufacturing by moving its Straube manufacturing from Chicago Heights to its Haddorff Piano manufacturing plant in Rockford, Illinois, at Railroad Avenue and 9th Street‚Äîa leased facility that Haddorff shared with the Rockford Chair and Furniture Company. Haddorff had sold its original Rockford plant on Harrison Avenue in 1940. In December 1940, a month after C.G. Conn's acquisition of the Haddorff Piano Company, Conn moved the Haddorff's manufacturing operations into the Railroad Avenue plant, which it had modernized. On May 30, 1942 ‚Äì a few weeks after C.G. Conn consolidated the manufacturing of Haddorff and Straube pianos at the Haddorff plant in Rockford ‚Äì the War Production Board (WPB) ordered that manufacturing of pianos at the Rockford plant cease by July 31, 1942. Under a war contract between C.G. Conn, Ltd., and the U.S. War Department, the Rockford plant produced parts for gliders and trainer planes from 1942 to 1946. ; Cessation of production of Straube pianos The last published reference to the sale of a Straube piano was in July 1946, when the Haddorff Piano Co. of Rockford, Illinois, exhibited a complete line of Haddorff and Straube grands and spinets at the Palmer House in Chicago during the Convention of the National Association of Music Merchants. Production of Straube pianos ceased in 1949. ; Dissolution of the Straube corporate entities C.G. Conn retained ownership of Straube Pianos Inc. until 1969, when C.G. Conn was acquired by the Crowell- Collier MacMillan Company. The assets of Straube Piano Inc. included those acquired from the March 1937 receivers sale of the former Straube Piano Company. The Indiana corporate charters of (i) Straube Pianos Inc. (incorporated March 25, 1937), (ii) Straube Piano Company Inc. (incorporated November 14, 1941), and (iii) Struabe Piano and Music Company (incorporated October 24, 1922) expired January 1, 1970.  Straube Piano & Music Company  The Straube Piano & Music Company was the retail division and subsidiary of the Straube Piano Company. It was launched around 1920. Also, in 1920, the retail division purchased a two-story building on S Hohman Street in Hammond, Indiana for $75,000. The building housed four stores and six office suites yielding rental income of about $9,000 a year. The building was made of brick and terra cotta and had frontage of 100 feet on South Hohman Street. The directors of Straube Piano Company incorporated its retail division in 1922.  Brands and models  =Straube brands= * Straube * Hammond ‚Äì Hammond pianos and players were an outgrowth of the Hammond Piano Co., organized in Hammond, Indiana, in 1904, by James F. Broderick. The Straube Piano Company held a controlling interest in the company. The objective was to produce medium grade pianos, with comparable quality, at lower prices than the premium Straubes. The Hammond Piano Co. launched its first two pianos in 1905, Style 21 and Style 23, both full uprights. Hammond pianos were made in the same factory as Straube and Gilmore pianos, but the Hammond Piano Co. business was kept separate. The Hammond Piano Co. was originally chartered in 1903 Illinois as the Chicago Electric Piano Co. by the Straube Piano Company. The incorporators were James T. Broderick, E. R. Jacobson and W. G. Martin, all of the Straube Piano Co. The purpose was to market a nickel-in-the-slot piano player known in the East as the Autoelectra. The name-change to Hammond Piano Co. was filed in Indiana in February 1905. * Gilmore ‚Äì Gilmore pianos began production in 1904 as a private label for a retail customer in Philadelphia, the customer being Gustave Herzberg (1835‚Äì1924), father of Edward Herzberg (1870‚Äì1931), who ran the piano department at the Snellenburg Store. Edward left Straube as vice president in 1904 to join his father. The Gilmore line ran until about 1927.

According to Straube literature, it was frictionless, non- corrosive, and eliminated 90 percent of all player problems caused by friction and corrosion in the mechanism. By 1922, over one million Straube pendulum valves had been installed in player pianos of various makes. : The valves were three-tier and horizontal, but not the more common type found in horizontal valve actions, which were usually the wire i-pin variety. Each valve pivoted between two ears that extended from each metal plate. : Each valve was a wood disc with leather facing on both sides. One face had a center hole leading to a pocket of a larger diameter in the wood. The valve was supported only by a lever between the valve plate pivot and the pouch lifter disc, with a right angle dowel extension that \\"plugged in\\" the center hole of the valve button. The pivotal lever is easily removable because it was not cemented to the valve, rendering a loose valve button in the valve well behind the valve plate that was screwed onto the valve chest with white sealing compound. * The Straube Style L was a short upright ‚Äì only 3 ft 7 inches tall, introduced in 1926 ‚Äì that incorporated Straube's patented Duplex Overstringing. Straube claimed that the Duplex Overstringing enabled the piano to produce the sound of a full upright. * The Melo-Harp was a patented pneumatic-controlled attachment for Straube pianos. * The Straube GrandsStraube Grands, Players, Uprights, Straube Piano Company (1922); offered in 1927 included lengths four-foot-four, five-foot-two, six-foot, and six-foot-two in various styles. * Straube Reproducing Grands were automated player pianos that used a Welte- Mignon action manufactured under license by the Auto Pneumatic Action Co. of Manhattan, New York. In 1924, Straube introduced individual names for its players rather than alpha letters in an effort to stimulate retail sales. A year earlier, Straube introduced a uniform national pricing policy. In 1923, Straube also launched a national advertising campaign. Explanation of the term Studio Grand: A tall upright piano ‚Äì 50 inches or taller, one that a person of average height can't see over when seated at the bench ‚Äì is sometimes referred to as an \\"upright grand\\". Straube branded it as a \\"Cabinet Grand\\". Use of the word \\"grand\\" with uprights should not be confused with concert grands. Upright grands can be of high quality and ‚Äì short of concert grands ‚Äì are often the choice of serious pianists, recording studios, and performance venues. A mid- high upright ‚Äì one that one can barely see over ‚Äì is often used in dance studios, where an accompanist can see the dancers. A short upright, one that rises less than a foot above the keyboard, is referred to as a spinet. Serious pianists typically regard spinets as inadequate because the soundboard is too short to produce a full sound with full overtones.

The AN/GYK-12 is a militarized version of the L-3050 computer ruggedized for use in the TACFIRE tactical fire direction system. The design dates from the 1960s. In 1980 the Army introduced the Nebula instruction set architecture (MIL-STD-1862), intended as an upgrade to the AN/GYK-12. Nebula is also a 32-bit architecture with 32-bit addressing mode and instructions optimized for running programs written in Ada. Description The basic system consists of three rack-mounted modules: The CPU, the IOU (Input/Output unit), and the MCMU. Modules are mounted vertically and are wide by high. The AN/GYK-12 has a 32-bit instruction format and operates on data from one bit to a doubleword (64 bits) in size. Only fixed- point binary arithmetic is provided. The system can have a maximum of 32768 pages--64 million words--of 2 Œºs memory (256 MB). Physically memory is divided into banks of 8 KW to minimize memory contention. Logically it is divided into pages of 2 KW each. Access to pages is controlled by 16 Page Control and Address Registers per program level, allowing an individual program to directly address 128 KB at one time. The AN-GYK-12 CPU features 64 hardware priority program levels, numbered from 0 (highest) to 63 (lowest). One task can run at each level. Level 0 is reserved for \\"power off\\". Level 1 is power- on restart. Level 2 handles hardware and program errors. Level 63 is entered after completion of a boot load. Therefore the system can support a maximum of 60 user tasks. Tasks are scheduled preemptively‚Äîa task will run until an error occurs, until it gives up control to another task, or until successful completion of an input/output operation transfers control to the so-called normal program level. Each task also has a privilege level, which controls the operations it is allowed to perform. Level '00'b is used for non-privileged programs. Level '01'b programs are semi-privileged. Level '10'b programs are privileged and can execute all instructions and I/O operations. Level '11'b is unused. The system uses Sylvania Universal High Level II Integrated Circuits (SUHL II), manufactured by Collins Radio, Honeywell, Raytheon and Motorola Semi-Conductor Division.Testimony of Gen. Edward C.

It was aired on August 21, 2014. The episode was written by Anupam Nigam and directed by Andy Wolk. The episode aired back-to-back with the next episode, \\"Doll Parts\\". Plot Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) steals a terrasphere from the E-Rep but Nolan (Grant Bowler) stops her before she escapes and returns the sphere to the E-Rep soldiers covering her. He asks her what is going on but Irisa does not want to tell him, so he cuffs her and takes her everywhere with him till he knows why she stole the sphere and what she wanted it for. Alak (Jesse Rath) ends his relationship with Deirdre (Kristina Pesic) by telling her that he loves Christie (Nicole Mu√±oz) and he wants to focus on his family and his child. He then returns home and asks Christie to forgive him for his behavior at the club, Christie accepts his apology, and they make up. Later, Deirdre arrives to get out for lunch with Christie and while Christie goes to take her purse, Alak makes Deirdre clear that the two of them are done. Deirdre does not like that and he tells him that she will keep fighting for him. Stahma (Jaime Murray) listens to Alak's conversation with Deirdre while Christie comes back and the two girls leave. Ambassador Tennety (Jane MacLean) arrives at Defiance to inspect the mines and Pottinger (James Murray) takes her for a tour at the mines along with Amanda (Julie Benz), Nolan, Irisa, and Berlin (Anna Hopkins). While there, an explosion happens and Tennety is killed, Pottinger and Amanda get trapped, and the rest manage to get out in time. Nolan calls Rafe (Graham Greene) to come and help with the rescue of Amanda, while Irisa gets the opportunity to free herself and run away. Nolan and Rafe come up with a plan to save Amanda and Pottinger as soon as possible, since the cave in which they are trapped will run out of air. While trying to do it, Nolan finds a Votan weapon and realizes that the explosion was not an accident, but that someone planned it. He asks Rafe if he knows anything about it, and Rafe says he will research it. Amanda and Pottinger come closer while being trapped and they kissed before Nolan finds them and takes them out. Irisa finds Tommy (Dewshane Williams) and asks his help to get the terrasphere by telling him that the thing that is inside her is now killing her and she needs the terrasphere to save herself. Tommy believes her and steals the terrasphere for her. Stahma meets Datak (Tony Curran) and informs him about Deirdre being a problem to the family, asking him to take care of her. When Datak refuses to take the money Stahma offers him, and instead asks her as the price to return home, Stahma says she will take care of Deirdre herself. Rafe asks Quentin's (Justin Rain) help to hide the weapons he has, because if Nolan finds out about them, he will believe that he was behind the explosion. When Rafe sees that one of the weapons is missing, he realizes that Quentin was the one behind it. Quentin explains that he did it under the orders of the Votanis Collective so he can get his mother back, and hits Rafe. Nolan gets there a little bit later and Quentin claims that his father confessed to him that he was the one who put the bomb in the mines to kill the Ambassador. When Rafe asked his help to hide the weapons and Quentin refused, Rafe became physical. Nolan does not believe Quentin's story and asks Rafe to tell him the truth but Rafe takes the blame to protect his son, and Nolan arrests him. After the death of the Ambassador, the Votanis Collective release Pilar (Linda Hamilton), Quentin's mother, who is happy to be back, and they will finally be a family again with Rafe and her children. Quentin tells her that Rafe will not be with them since he framed him for the Ambassador's death, something that Pilar does not like and tells him that what he did was stupid. The episode ends with Tommy bringing the terrasphere to Irisa and Irisa makes him part of her mission by \\"saving\\" him. She then proceeds to make the ritual for the Arkrise by using the terrasphere.  Feature music  In the \\"Bottom of the World\\" we can hear the song \\"What's Up\\" by Lauren Tate. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Bottom of the World\\" was watched by 1.42 million; down by 0.16 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Bottom of the World\\" received mixed reviews. Kris from Movie Trailer Reviews gave the episode a B+ rating saying that the stories start to wrap up and come together but he thinks that killing Ambassador Tennety was a mistake and waste since the character was decent and with bigger potential. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating and commenting on both episodes (Bottom of the World and Doll Parts that aired the same night) says that the human motivation that was present in the second season so far, has largely been replaced by mythology. \\"This is a consistent disappointment thanks to the \\"resistance story\\" setup of the second season. The resistance story is powerful primarily because it accents the essential humanity of its major characters. The resistance is forced to compromise their ideals in order to achieve victory; those in power are forced to exert their essential humanity in the face of the issues of maintaining power. [...] Something still might happen to knock the E-Rep out, but it‚Äôs no longer a built-up human story. And yes, I will almost always prefer a story based on human motivations to one based on mystery and mythology.\\" Michael Ahr from Den of Geek rated the episode with 4/5 saying that it was better to air the two episodes together because neither of the two episodes would have sarisfied on its own. \\"...the two [episodes] together felt like an intricate unfolding of relationships with a variety of changes for the principal characters to absorb and plenty of time to draw out the associated emotions.\\" Katelyn Barnes of Geeks Unleashed rated the episode with 6/10 commenting that Irisa's storyline is finally moving on but she \\"found the fallout surrounding Treasure Doll much more interesting\\" which took place in the second episode of the night. Ashley Binion from The Nerd Machine rated the episode with 2.5/5 commenting that the two episodes \\"needed to be seen consecutively as neither episode was particularly excellent on its own\\". About Bottom of the World she says that altogether was a forgettable episode. Billy Grifter of Den of Geek commented that the episode ended with two points of interest; the arrival of Rafe's bi-polar wife who appears more rational than expected and the unleash of the terrasphere by Irisa.

Hutchens became a messenger at Putney railway station at 14 and soon discovered he was a fast runner. He became a professional in 1876. Hutchens died poor and in obscurity in 1939 but received an obituary from The New York Times.  Athletic career  In 1920, American Olympic champion and writer Ellery Harding Clark declared that Harry Hutchens was \\"the greatest sprinter the world had ever seen.\\" Hutchens is regarded by many observers as the greatest sprinter of the 19th century. Hutchens always ran from a standing start and set nine professional world records in all. His New York Times obituary claimed that he went unbeaten for 15 years.New York Times obituary (5 January 1939) Hutchens ran 131.25 yards (120 meters) in 12.2 seconds at the Sheffield Handicap in 1882 (the equivalent of 10.3 for 100 meters). He was timed at 9.75 seconds for 100y in 1887. Hutchens ran 140 yards in 13.5 seconds in 1885. He ran 150 yards in 14.5 seconds in 1887. In 1885 he ran 350 yards (320 meters) in 38.4 seconds.Roberto Quercetani and Gustavo Pallicca (2003) A World History of Sprint Racing 1850‚Äì2005. On 2 January 1884, Hutchens clocked 30.0 seconds for 300 yards (274 meters) on the grass track at the Powderhall meet in Edinburgh, easing up. Doug Walker, the 1998 European 200 meter champion and European record holder for 300 meters, tried to beat Hutchen‚Äôs time in 1999. He also ran in January in Edinburgh but only managed to run 30.05 seconds. After the race, Walker said \\"It was an amazing run, absolutely amazing. Apparently he (Hutchens) had his hands in the air, celebrating, from 30 yards out. Some runner.\\"Doug Walker (9 January 1999) \\"The ghost of Harry Hutchens stalks Meadowbank as an ancient record stays intact\\". The Independent According to Edward Seldon Sears, Hutchens ran a time-trial in 29.5 seconds before the Powderhall race.Edward Seldon Sears (2001) Running Through the Ages. McFarland. In 1887 Hutchens was due to compete in \\"The Race of the Century\\", as the newspapers of the day billed the 120 yards world championship race between himself and Harry Gent. Gent had emerged as a rival after running the equivalent of 9.7 for 100 yards to win the Sheffield Handicap. The Lillie Bridge stadium in London was packed with 15,000 spectators. The race did not take place because the bookmakers feared they would lose money. They discovered that Gent had secretly broken down in training. The two runners were bundled out of a side-entrance. \\"They stood over me in the dressing-room with open knives and bottles,\\" Hutchens told The Sporting Life. \\"They swore they would murder me if I tried to run.\\" When their non-appearance was announced, the crowd set fire to the stadium. This prompted the demise of pedestrianism, as the popular sport of racing for prize money was known in its 19th-century heyday.  Contemporary views on Hutchens  As a professional sprinter Hutchens often tried to conceal his form, from bookmakers as well as handicappers. He rarely ran flat-out. The best judges of his greatness were other runners who trained with him. British runner Charles Wood (1861‚Äì1937) set a world amateur record for 220 yards at 21.6 in 1887.Robert Metcalfe (April/May 2012) \\"Local Lynx 83\\", p. 21 Wood told the Otago Witness in 1905 that ‚ÄúI consider that Harry Hutchens of Putney was the best sprinter of all time. Only men who could run and had run with Hutchens could understand what a marvel he was. I have been doing 10.2 for 100 yards but when running with Hutchens I am lost altogether. He could do 9.5 easily, and could smother L.E. Myers in the quarter-mile.\\"World's Best Sprinter\\". Otago Witness, Issue 2693, 25 October 1905, p. 63 Lon Myers held the American record for 100 yards at 10.0 seconds and was U.S. champion twice.http://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/USA- Champions/USAOutdoorTF/men/100m.aspx Myers sometimes trained with Hutchens and in his biography, claimed that Hutchens was at least 6 yards faster over 100 yards, which would indicate he could run 9.4 seconds for 100 yards. James S. Mitchel claimed in 1901 in his book Athletics Giants of the Past that some observers thought Hutchens could run 9.2 seconds.James S. Mitchel (1901) Athletics Giants of the Past Hutchens and Reggie Walker, the 1908 Olympic 100 meters champion shared a coach in Sam Wisdom. Walker in 1910 described Hutchens as the \\"greatest phenomenal sprinter of all time.\\"R.E. Walker (1910) Textbook on Sprinting Sam Mussabini (1867‚Äì1927) coached the 1924 Olympic 100 meter champion Harold Abrahams. As a sprinter, he described Hutchens \\"as the most brilliant of all time.\\" He believed that Hutchens was capable of running 29 seconds for 300 yards if he had specially trained for the event.Ellery Harding Clark (1920) Track athletics up to date Guy Butler won a gold medal in the 4√ó400 m relay at the 1920 Summer Olympics.

He was also a prolific inventor. He was one of the pioneers of the servomechanism, where a feedback loop helps control a machine. The invention lets one helmsman control a ship's rudder weighing several tons. Life Jean Joseph L√©on Farcot was born in Paris on 23 June 1824. He was the son of the engineer Marie-Joseph Farcot (1798‚Äì1875). His grandfather was the learned economist and philanthropist Joseph Jean Chrysostome Farcot (1744‚Äì1815). At first he was interested in history, but then decided to join the family business. He obtained a diploma in 1845 from the Central School of Arts and Manufactures in Paris. He then joined the family firm. In 1846 Marie-Joseph Farcot transferred his factory close to the docks and railway station in Saint-Ouen on the Seine. Through successive purchases of land the works grew to almost . The main output of the factory was steam engines, but it also produced boilers, pumps and electrical machines. Joseph Farcot help build the workshops in Saint-Ouen. In 1848 he became head of the research section of the Maison Farcot. The factory employed 145 workers in 1849, and 500‚Äì700 between 1872 and 1902. The Farcot horizontal steam engine at the 1867 Exhibition In 1867 the Maison Farcot received the Grand Prix pour m√©rite hors ligne at the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris. Almost all the machines they exhibited were designed by Joseph Farcot. They exhibited two coupled horizontal steam engines at the exhibition each of which delivered 80 horsepower. They won a gold medal for their horizontal steam engines in the class of motors, generators and mechanical devices. The report of the jury noted that the Farcots had installed two 100 horsepower Woolf pumps which took water from the Seine at the quai d'Austerlitz in Paris and delivered it along a line of to the reservoirs at M√©nilmontant, higher up. Joseph Farcot was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in 1867, and officer in 1878. In 1879 he became president of the society of civil engineers of France. Joseph Farcot died in Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis, on 19 March 1908. He was aged eighty three. After his death the factory in Saint-Ouen ran into difficulties. It was sold in 1915, and in 1924 was acquired by Andr√© Citro√´n. Inventions Joseph Farcot obtained patents for aspects of steam engines, controllers, pumps, generators, cranes and thermal engines. He filed 41 patent applications in 1854‚Äì63, 88 from 1864‚Äì73 and 64 from 1884‚Äì98. =Governors= In November 1788 James Watt produced a design for a \\"fly ball\\" governor, titled \\"Centrifugal speed regulator\\", a device for automatically controlling the speed of a steam engine so that it would run at the same rate despite changes in the heat of the fire. This was crucial in cotton spinning. The governor was simple and adequate for many uses, and for many years remained the most common form of governor. However it was prone to hunting from one speed to another and had low power. Engineers designed various types of hydraulic or pneumatic pump regulator to overcome the limitations of Watt's governor. Automatic variable expansion-gear attachment to a Corliss engine (1878) Marie-Joseph Farcot designed a governor in 1854, and he and Joseph designed several others after this, including the crossed-arm governor, which achieved close to isochronous operation, although it was prone to instability. The Farcots refined the design with friction brakes, and in 1864 added an air dashpot. They obtained a patent for a spring- loaded governor in 1864. Farcot's automatic variable expansion-gear, an attachment to a Corliss steam engine, was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris. The mechanism supported a wide range of automatic cut-offs between 0 and 80% of the stroke, with a relatively simple and elegant design. =Servomechanisms= Joseph Farcot may deserve as much credit as John McFarlane Gray for inventing steering engines that use feedback. With his servo-motor design of 1859 Joseph Farcot implemented the feedback principle. This allowed a giant battleship with a rudder weighing several tons to be steered using a single wheel. The mechanism used the position of the rudder to direct the right amount of steam to a piston that controlled the rudder. This was the basis for the theoretical discipline of cybernetics. Farcot was given a British patent for a steering engine in 1868. In 1873 he published a book Le servo-moteur ou moteur asservi that described the different steam steering devices that Farcot and Son had developed. Farcot noted that with the steering engine of the B√©lier coastal defense ship, a force of by the helmsman could operate a rudder with loads of .

It was aired on August 21, 2014. The episode was written by Phoef Sutton and directed by Andy Wolk. The episode aired back-to-back with the previous episode, \\"Bottom of the World\\". Plot The episode starts with the murder of Deirdre (Kristina Pesic) when someone throws her from the Arch. Amanda (Julie Benz) goes to Nolan (Grant Bowler) to ask his help to find the murderer but Nolan has to find Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) who disappeared. Since he can not investigate the murder, he gives Amanda a deputy's badge so she can make the investigation. Nolan tracks Irisa and tries to understand what she plans to do, when Tommy (Dewshane Williams), who now has Irzu too inside him, finds him and threatens him with a gun. Nolan fights back and while they are fighting, Tommy rejects Irzu and controls his body again. Nolan explains that Irzu is not a god but the artificial intelligence of the ship that is buried under old Saint Louis and pretends to be a god. Tommy informs Nolan that Irzu wants to destroy the world and the two of them team up to stop this from happening and help Irisa. Tommy takes Nolan to the camp so he can talk to Irisa. Irisa accuses him that he never loved her and for killing too many Votans and tells him that he can not save him. Nolan tries to tell her that Irzu is not real and the two of them argue when Sukar (Noah Danby) comes in and stops them. Nolan provokes Sukar and the two of them start to fight while Tommy activates a device that makes all the Votans collapse. Nolan and Tommy take the unconscious Irisa and leave. Back in Defiance, Amanda tries to find the murderer with Berlin's (Anna Hopkins) help. They find out from Deirdre's agenda that the night before she was killed, she had an appointment with Datak (Tony Curran) so Amanda goes to his place for questions. From their conversation, and a talk she had with Deirdre at the Need/Want, Amanda realizes that Alak (Jesse Rath) was sleeping with her and was the person Deirdre was in love with. Amanda and Berlin arrest Alak after lying about his relationship with Deirdre and after finding a tape of him threatening to kill her if she talks to Christie (Nicole Mu√±oz). In the meantime, one of the Tarr family servants, finds a bloody microphone hidden under Alak's bed and shows it to Stahma (Jaime Murray). Christie and Stahma visit Alak in prison where Christie says that she believes him about being innocent but she now knows that he betrayed her while Alak believes his mother or father killed Dierdre and framed him to teach him a lesson. Stahma, believing that Datak framed Alak, visits a dying Castithan and makes a deal with him; if he confess that he was the one who killed Deirdre, then the Tarr family will make sure that his daughter will always have a job at their home as a handmaiden after his death. The man accepts the deal and goes to Amanda with the murder weapon (the bloody microphone) turning himself in, not leaving other choice to her than to let Alak free. Stahma then visits Datak to ask him why he would frame his own son but Datak tells her that he did not kill Deirdre and that he assumed she was the one who killed her. Stahma realizes that the one who killed Deirdre was Christie while at the same time, Alak gets back home where Christie confesses to him what she did and why; Deirdre tried to kill her baby by poisoning her so she can be with Alak. The two of them fought and Christie ended up throwing Deirdre from the Arch. The episode ends with Irisa waking up while Nolan and Tommy drive her away till from the rest of the Votans till they find a way to help her. She knocks out Nolan, stabs Tommy and then leaves.

[...] My only real negative was Amanda running the \\"investigation\\" and the attempt to make Deirdre seem like a normal, not crazy woman.\\" Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating and commenting on both episodes (Doll Parts and Bottom of the World that aired the same night) says that the human motivation that was present in the second season so far, has largely been replaced by mythology. \\"This is a consistent disappointment thanks to the \\"resistance story\\" setup of the second season. The resistance story is powerful primarily because it accents the essential humanity of its major characters. The resistance is forced to compromise their ideals in order to achieve victory; those in power are forced to exert their essential humanity in the face of the issues of maintaining power. [...] Something still might happen to knock the E-Rep out, but it‚Äôs no longer a built-up human story. And yes, I will almost always prefer a story based on human motivations to one based on mystery and mythology.\\" Katelyn Barnes from Geeks Unleashed rated the episode with 8/10 commenting that Irisa's storyline is finally moving on but she \\"found the fallout surrounding Treasure Doll much more interesting\\". Michael Ahr of Den of Geek rated the episode with 4/5 saying that it was better to air the two episodes together because neither of the two episodes would have sarisfied on its own. \\"...the two [episodes] together felt like a intricate unfolding of relationships with a variety of changes for the principal characters to absorb and plenty of time to draw out the associated emotions.\\" Ashley Binion from The Nerd Machine rated the episode with 4/5 commenting that the two episodes \\"needed to be seen consecutively as neither episode was particularly excellent on its own\\". About Doll Parts she says that Amanda was the star of the episode. Billy Grifter of Den of Geek commented on Deidre's story saying that the season had some very soap opera plotlines but the positive side of that story is that Alak‚Äôs character has grown up, and Christie isn‚Äôt the rather twee girl-next-door any more.

Players play as one of seven different wolves, each with their own coloured magic fireballs. The game plays similar to dodgeball, with opposing teams collecting orbs around the playing field in order to shoot fireballs to hit and eliminate the opposing team's players. After being shot, fireballs keep bouncing around the edge of the arena and speed up over time. Players are not affected by their own coloured fireballs, and orbs can also be used to shield from the other team's fireballs. Players earn points for winning individual rounds, and a player wins the match by winning a set number of rounds. Development Michael Ventnor, the head of Craftven, came up with the idea of Lupinball during PAX Australia 2014. He told Player2 the idea came about after canning a different idea stemming from playing Firestriker, to which his friends described as \\"[reinventing] Lethal League\\", which was unknown to him.

It is celebrated annually during the Amavashya of Kartik month.http://www.jharkhandonline.in/about/profile/culture/festivals> Bandna is a celebration of the paddy seeds that are sown by the region's agrarian communities. This festival is celebrated by the Hindu cultivator caste, Kurmi (Kudmi/Kudumi) and Kurmali-speaking tribes of East India. It is one of many Indian festivals during which cattle are worshiped.  Ritual  Bandna is a seven-day festival: the first three days are Chumaan; the fourth day is Goth Puja; the fifth day is Goriyaa Puja; the sixth day is Borod Khuntaan; and the seventh day is Budhi Bandna. The rituals of the first three days sometimes extend up to five days prior to Goth Puja. Myth  When Lord Shiva (Bara Pahar) created men, he provided them with food. In due course, they multiplied into a sizable population. Shiva advised them to produce their own food by cultivating the land. However, without agricultural implements and technology, farmers had many problems. They beseeched the lord for a solution. Shiva took pity on them and provided them with cattle. Initially, the relationship between the men and the cattle was cordial, but over time, it worsened and the cattle were abused. The cattle complained to Shiva. The complaint encompassed strenuous work, extended work hours, inadequate food, unhygienic shelters, beatings, lack of recreation and ingratitude towards their contribution. The lord assured them that he would inspect secretly on the night of Kartik Amavasya. Incidentally, the men came to know about the complaints, and as a result, they became alert. The people cleaned their houses and cowsheds, and on the day of Amavasya, the cattle were properly washed while their horns and forehead were smeared with oil and vermilion. The cattle were provided with fodder and the Gohal (cowshed) was illuminated with Diyas (earthen lamps). Bundles of grass were put along with Diyas on both sides of the entrance of the cowshed. Sohrai grass was placed on the roof to signify the availability of food for the cattle. On the second day, Shiva found the people worshiping Garaiya with special offerings, including a sacrifice made in their honor. On the third day, he observed that the cattle were in a merry mood, dancing with the people. The songs and the music filled the air with warmth, enthusiasm and harmony. On his way back, he found the Bagals/Dhangars (contractual shepherds) playing with the cattle at the gochar (grazing land). This made the complaint invalid. The next season, the cattle complained again about hardships, prompting Shiva to inspect them on the same day. The lord made a secret visit, finding the cattle happy and content. Since then, the tradition continued and is annually celebrated as Bandna Parab.

The white, wooden church was built in a rectangular style in 1988 using designs by the architect Andreas Vold. The church seats about 90 people.

The architect Ivar Namtveit was hired to build the chapel. It was consecrated on 1 April 1926. It was a simple wooden building with a tower over the south entrance. In 1956-1957, a sacristy was built on the east side of the building. In 1988, the old chapel was torn down and a new building was constructed in the spring of 1988.

The organization focuses on the academic success of foster children. NYFC's goal is to help all youth in the foster care system succeed academically and with equal opportunity in the workforce. With their partner Administration for Children's Services (ACS), NYFC is able to provide school supplies, access to academic counselling, job opportunities, access to schools, as well as financial support to keep them in school. Since its founding New Yorkers For Children has raised and donated over $55 million to its programs, scholarships, and its partnership with ACS.  Background  Nicholas Scoppetta founded NYFC after he was recruited by New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to run the newly formed children service agency. Scopetta was credited for facilitating the re-formulation of the system which resulted in improved training, management, pay, and accountability. He was also successful in getting more children adopted out of the system, reducing case loads, as well as hiring more employees. With these achievements Scoppetta formed NYFC and was the President of Board of Directors until his retirement in 2013 where he was replaced by Eric Brettschneider. Brettschneider started working in the child welfare and social services in 1967 and has worked in various specializations of that sector ever since. With his experience he has pledged to \\"continue the tradition Nick (Scoppetta) established - empowering the child welfare community\\".  Projects * Back to School Package Program The program aims at supplying people from the foster system with supplies necessary for their successful completion of a bachelor's degree. The package, valued at $1000, comes with a metro pass, laptop, and Amazon gift card intended to help the student purchase more supplies and eliminate some of their disadvantages. NYFC has provided 8,000 packages to 2,500 students in foster care. * Nicholas Scopetta Scholarship Program This program provides financial, emotional, and academic support to students to ensure their successful completion of an academic career. Working together with the \\"private sector, foster care agencies, CUNY (City University of New York, the system of universities in New York) and Private Colleges in New York City\\" the NYFC has been able to provide a support system for the students in or leaving foster care. * The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund This Emergency Fund goes to people leaving the foster care system and financially supports them to be able to complete their educations without having to worry about their financial situations too much. Since these students leave the care of the foster system without the traditional support from families they often live pay cheque to pay cheque. Once a financial emergency hits, the students are forced to decide between their education and finding a job to raise funds for their basic needs. The Charles Evans Emergency Educational Fund provides students with financial support to ensure they continue their education. * The Spirit Award The Spirit Award is given to a student from the foster care system that is succeeding in college as well as demonstrating leadership, commitment to the community, determination, and has shown the ability to overcome barriers. In 2016 the award was given to two students in full ($10,000) and second place prizes were awarded to two students of the value of $2,500. * Wrap to Rap The Wrap to Rap is a holiday event where board members, friends of the NYFC, and teens of the community join together to wrap Christmas presents. The gifts go to children in foster care. The event serves as a community event to support the organizations efforts while allowing teens the opportunity to learn of the struggles of others and simultaneously getting them involved in volunteering for the community. * The Youth Advisory Board (YAB) The Youth Advisory Board is in charge of promoting social change in regards to changing how the social system supports foster children once they are too old for foster care. Their social policy efforts fight mainly for affordable housing, post secondary opportunities, and funding for college.  Funding  New Yorkers For Children makes most of its revenues from foundation and business organizations contributions. In 2016 alone the organization made $3.2 million in foundation and business organizations contributions. NYFC's special events bring in the second largest amount of revenue. From 2012 to 2016 NYFC's events brought in on average $2.1 million. Each event honours a few of the children receiving aid from the foundation and supplies them with proper clothing attire for the night. The events are also each sponsored by a big brand or corporation, for example Chlo√© and by Circa in 2010. In 2015 the Spring Dinner Dance was presented by Saks Fifth Avenue, the Fool's Fete of 2012 was sponsored by CD Greene. Each of these big named sponsors bring in different crowds of people to the events and increases and diversifies the organizations base of donors. * The New Yorkers For Children Annual Fall Gala Held every year in the fall, NYFC's New Yorker For Children Annual Fall Gala at Cipriani 42nd Street consistently raises over $1.2 million. With tickets starting at $1,200 and tables being sold for up to $50,000, the evening is always a success for the organization. The event is attended by actors, designers, athletes, journalists, artists, wealthy business entrepreneurs, and singers all willing to spend big money for charity. The Gala is meant to raise money as well as acknowledge people for their own charitable efforts. It also receives media coverage from well known news outlets like Vogue, InStyle, and New Getty. * New Yorkers For Children Spring Dinner Dance In 2015 the event held at the Mandarin Oriental raised $750,000 with tickets selling out before they are made open to the public. In 2015 the event was publicized not only for its philanthropic work but also because it honoured the fashion legend Oscar de la Renta giving the event an edge in the media. More attention is brought to the event due to the attendance of well known people like actress Emma Roberts as well as royalty of a Saudi Prince in 2013. Although the event does not raise as much money as the Annual Fall Gala, the publicity that the organization gets largely affects its donations.  Public Support  New Yorkers For Children receives a lot of supports from public figures, actors, artists, singers, athletes, etc. In 2009 Anderson Cooper, anchor for CNN, hosted the annual fall gala. This night included awarding Mary J. Blige the Nicholas Scoppetta Child Welfare Award for her own organization FFAWN which empowers and supports women to go to college. Past honourees include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Geoffrey Canada, Russell Simmons, and All-Pro Linebacker for the New York Giants, Keith Bulluck. This list of honourees shows the diverse background of people that participate in charitable functions. Furthermore, the annual fall gala also included Ne-Yo performing his hit songs and Oscar-nominated director Tony Gilroy premiered his short film about eight youth in foster care. 19 youth who receive aid from NYFC were guests of honour. Macy's provided them with clothing while MAC Cosmetics and French hairstylist Frederic Fekkai provided hair and makeup. In 2013 Hugh Jackman co-chaired the event with his wife Deborra-Lee Furness. Jackman expressed his appreciation and support for New Yorkers For Children: \\"I love what New Yorkers for Children does. It's at a grass-roots level, it doesn't throw money here and there, it really looks after kids with what they need emotionally as well as financially.\\"  Work With Administration for Children Services  New Yorkers For Children is partnered with the government organization Administration for Children Services (ACS). NYFC supports the organization's projects financially. In 2016 the NYFC donated $100,000 in grants to fund the Community Connections Project, The Door Project, and ACS Special Programs and Events. The Community Connections Project is a detention release initiative that works to support low risk individuals that are being removed from detention and rehabilitated in their homes with their families. The Door project works to offer homeless people and \\"system-involved\\" young people better access to post-secondary opportunities. This initiative is community based and supported by education services, and external partnerships. ACS Special Programs and Events promotes child wellbeing projects specifically Safe Sleep Symposium and Child Abuse Awareness month.

Founded in support of Andrew Jackson, it continued as a Democratic Party organ up to its eventual consolidation with the Pittsburgh Mercury. Beginning Coming off a series of brief and sometimes stormy newspaper editorships in South Central Pennsylvania, John McFarland established a new paper in 1824 with the express purpose of backing the candidacy of Andrew Jackson in that fall's presidential election. The first issue, published on Wood Street in downtown Pittsburgh, appeared on June 22 of that year under the title Allegheny Democrat, and Farmers' and Mechanics' Advertiser. After three years of promoting Jacksonism, McFarland died in 1827 at the age of 30. Johns years Upon McFarland's death the Democrat passed to 22-year-old Leonard Shryock Johns, who would cover Jackson's ascension to the presidency in the election of 1828. The editorial tenure of Johns was marked by an uncritical advocacy of Jackson and his policies, and hostility to the president's b√™te noire, the United States Bank. In late 1833, with subscriptions on the rise, Johns increased the publication frequency to semiweekly. He soon thereafter took a post as city alderman and for that reason offered the Democrat for sale, but with no politically compatible buyer forthcoming, retained possession of the paper and reverted it back to weekly publication. Eventually finding a purchaser in 1836, he retired from journalism to focus on his political and business career. Stewart Succeeding Johns as owner and editor of the Democrat was Wilson F. Stewart, who promised to continue the paper's support of the national Democratic ticket and opposition to the accumulation of banking power. He appended \\"Workingmen's Advocate\\" to the title, indicating his sympathy for the Working Men's Party and the interests of laborers. Stewart engaged in harsh rhetoric with competitors. One of his editorials provoked Zantzinger McDonald of The American Manufacturer, a rival Democratic sheet, to enter Stewart's office and point a pistol at him. Stewart either bravely fended off his foe or dropped to the floor in fear, depending on whose account is to be believed. On the possibility of a further encounter with McDonald, Stewart wrote, \\"I am ready in true Yankee fashion to knock the noise out of this sprig of nobility to the entire satisfaction of his friends...a native mechanic against one of the silk stocking nobility.\\" Stewart gave his age at the time as 22. Stewart sold out in April 1838, less than two years after he embarked on his turbulent journalistic enterprise. The ostensible buyer and new editor was William Jack, formerly connected with the Washington, Pennsylvania Examiner. Some of the local press suspected that the purchase was effected by federal officeholders who disliked Stewart's opposition to President Martin Van Buren's sub-treasury plan, but this notion was repudiated by Jack and by one of the supposed federal schemers, U.S. District Attorney Benjamin Patton. Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline Pittsburgher In 1839, under the management of William Jack and John W. Shugert, the paper spawned a daily edition called the Daily Pittsburgher, while the weekly publication continued as such but under the new name Weekly Pittsburgher, and Allegheny Democrat. Shugert soon left and was replaced by William McElroy. Consolidation The Daily Pittsburgher was defunct by the end of 1840, and in February of the following year, its surviving weekly counterpart was purchased by William H. Smith, editor of a competing Democratic journal, the Pittsburgh Mercury. Smith merged the two papers to form the Pittsburgh Mercury and Allegheny Democrat and assured his readers that he would conduct it in the political spirit of its predecessors. The consolidation of the city's Democratic newspapers culminated in September 1842, when the Mercury and Democrat united with the American Manufacturer to create the Daily Morning Post and its weekly edition, the Weekly Mercury and Manufacturer. Eventually, as part of a blockbuster deal in 1927, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was born from the combination of the Post and the Gazette Times.

While John Robertson received directing credit, Edward H. Griffith supposedly took extensive re-takes after production ended and the film was deemed not audience ready. Two actresses with major roles in the original version were completely cut from the final release, Helen Twelvetrees and June Collyer. The original screenplay was written by Horace Jackson and James Gleason. While the film might not have made a profit at the box office, it was well received by critics. Plot On the Western Front during World War I, an American battalion advances to the French town of Nevremont, where it is outflanked. Sergeant Bill Thatcher (Bill Boyd) is left in charge of a small rear guard of four men to cover the battalion's retreat before it is cut off. During heavy shelling, Bill tries to comfort his men after each is wounded. The first, \\"Bud\\" (Russell Gleason), relates his story of how he joined the military, leaving the family farm to enlist, despite his mother's pleas for him not to become involved in foreign conflicts. As he finishes his story, he dies. The second doughboy, Lew Cavanaugh (Lew Cody), is a New York playboy who used enlistment as a way to have a final night of pleasure with one of his conquests, never realizing that he would die on a French battlefield. The third American, the unsoldierly Jim Mobley (James Gleason), is not as badly wounded as the other two soldiers and tells his story of his wife's displeasure after he announces his intention to enlist and his own consternation at his inability explain to her why. Thatcher then relates his own story, where he was engaged to a German immigrant back in the United States but did not wed her due to their differences over the \\"Great War\\". Shortly after, the Germans attack again, during which Bill and Jim defend their position and blow up a bridge to cover the retreat of their battalion, but are badly wounded. A German soldier tries to bayonet the unconscious Bill but is stopped by another soldier. Both are captured and sent to a German hospital, where Bill is discovered by his erstwhile fianc√©, Katherine (Lissi Arna). She saves his life by persuading the German doctor to allow Bill, slowly bleeding to death but not allowed a transfusion because too many German patients are in need of one, to be transfused with her blood. After the armistice, with Bill recovered and decorated along with Jim for the defense of Nevremont, they celebrate the end of the fighting with Katherine. Cast * Bill Boyd as Sergeant Bill Thatcher * James Gleason as Private Jim Mobley * Lew Cody as Lew Cavanaugh * ZaSu Pitts as Mademoiselle Fritzi * Marion Shilling as Ina * Russell Gleason as Russell (\\"Bud\\") * Lissi Arna as Katherine * Mary Carr as Mother * Fred Scott as Fred * Theodore Von Eltz as Major Sparks (Cast list as per AFI database) Production The film was announced as part of Path√©'s 30-picture schedule for 1930-31 in February 1930. It was considered the premier film of Path√©'s schedule for the season. Boyd was attached to the project by the end of February, as part of his new deal with Path√©, in which he would only appear in Path√© \\"specials\\". Beyond Victory was to be the first film of that new deal. James Gleason was added to the cast in a featured role in March 1930. It was the first film for Gleason under his new exclusive long-term contract with Path√©. At the same time, it was revealed that John Robinson would be helming the film. Robert Armstrong was attached to the picture in early April. Also in early April, it was announced that Mauri Grashin had been signed as screenwriter to a long-term contract by Path√©, and Beyond Victory would be his first project. In June 1930, it was reported that Dorothy Burgess had been signed for a featured role in the film, and Zasu Pitts involvement with the picture as a knife-throwing entertainer was revealed, along with James Gleason's participation. In mid-June, Charles O'Loughlin was announced as the sound engineer on the project, although the final version included work from four sound engineers. The Film Daily reported that the film's producer, E.B. Derr, in conjunction with the director, John Robertson, took an unusual step and had each sequence in the film written by a different screenwriter. The writers included James Seymour, James Gleason, Lynn Riggs, Thomas Lennon, Mauri Grashin, and Garret Fort. The concept was to have five independent stories intertwined around a central theme. In Glason's adaptation, he wrote a role into the final version of the script for himself. By early May pre-production on the film was almost completed. And production on the film had begun by the middle of May. Also in May, the film was scheduled to be released on July 13, 1930. In early June, Robert Armstrong was replaced by Lew Cody. Armstrong was delayed on the production of Railroad Man. By June 15, 1930, the cast had grown to include William Boyd, Fred Scott, James Gleason, Russell Gleason, June Collyer, Helen Twelvetrees, Zasu Pitts, Purnell Pratt, and Bert Roach. The following week, Richard Tucker was added to the cast. Production on the film was almost complete by the end of June. On June 26, the final cast list was reported. Additions to the cast were: William Holden, E.H. Calvert, Fred Walton, Wade Boteler, Rockliffe Fellowes, Helen Baxter, George Stone, Elinor Millard, Ed Deering, Bert Sprotte, Conrad Seidemann, Paul Weigle, and Charles Giblyn. Millard was a stage actress, and this movie was her film debut. In addition to the unusual script development strategy used by Path√©, they also employed a U.S. Army Colonel, Frank S. Long, as a technical advisor on the film. A new type of silencer for the camera was employed on the picture, allowing a close-up of Boyd's hand signing a document to pick up the pen's scratching noise on the paper. The film included actual war footage from Path√©'s film library, which at the time had one of the most extensive collections of World War I footage. While the film's main cinematography was done by Norbert Brodine, William Dietz was hired to do some special trick photography. By July 11, 1930, production on the film was completed. By the end of the month, the picture was in the editing room. However, on July 23 it was announced that the film was being shelved for the time being, with portions to be re-shot. By August 21, the film was being advertised in major industry journals. In the released version of the film, scenes with Helen Twelvetrees and June Collyer were completely cut. In October it was announced that the film was scheduled for release on November 30, with the film undergoing some large re-shoots under the direction of E.H. Griffith. However, the film went back into the editing room in early December. The film's release date was eventually pushed back to be included in the 1931 release schedule. Path√© cut its planned 20 films for the 1930-31 schedule to 9, with Beyond Victory scheduled as the last of the nine. The reason cited was Path√©'s acquisition by RKO Pictures. Beyond Victory was one of three Path√© films which were purchased outright by RKO. Reception The reviews of the film were mixed. The Film Daily called it a \\"Fairly good war drama\\", highlighting the good performance of Marion Shilling. However, the magazine issued a retraction a short time later, noting that they meant to compliment the acting work of Lissi Arna, not Shilling. This sentiment was echoed by the Motion Picture Magazine, which called it a \\"War picture to talk about....\\" On the other hand, the Motion Picture Herald, described it as a \\"mixed-up affair, pacifist in theme, and in acting, story, direction and other departments woefully amateurish.\\" Notes Despite her scenes being cut, Helen Twelvetrees was part of a tie-in marketing campaign of the film and Outdoor Girl Face Powder. Richard Tucker, playing an American officer overseas in World War I was an actual officer in the American Expeditionary Force during the war. James Gleason was also an army veteran, having served during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Schilling's work on the film garnered her a long-term contract with Path√©. Bill Boyd was married to Dorothy Sebastian during the filming of the picture, with the couple delaying their honeymoon until the Spring of 1931.

Thanks to its speed and high resolution, this method is particularly useful for finding polymorphisms in DNA. In practice, the analysis begins with a standard PCR in order to amplify the fragment of interest. If the amplified region that exhibits the polymorphism(s) is hemizygous, two kinds of fragments corresponding to the allele and the wild polymorphic allele will be present in the PCR product. This first step is followed by a step of denaturation-renaturation to create hetero- and homoduplexes from the two allele populations in the PCR. To find a homozygous polymorphism, proceed in the same way by premixing a DNA wild population to a population of polymorphic DNA to obtain heteroduplexes after the denaturation- renaturation step. Heteroduplexes are actually double strands of DNA containing a strand from the wild-type allele and a sprig from the polymorphic allele. The formation of such DNA fragments then causes the appearance of a \\"mismatch\\" or bad pairing where the polymorphism is located. These \\"mismatches\\" in the heteroduplex are the basis for the polymorphism detection by DHPLC. Heteroduplexes are thermally less stable than their corresponding homoduplexes, and the single DNA strands will therefore be disconnected by chromatography when subjected to a sufficiently high temperature. The consequence of this double strand instability will be a mismatch of the two DNA strands in the region of polymorphism when DNA is heated to the DNA melting temperature. This mismatch will therefore decrease the interaction with the column and will result in a reduced retention time compared to the homoduplexes in the chromatographic separation process. To observe the phenomenon of separation, the DHPLC method uses a column of a non-grafted porous stationary phase composed of polystyrene-divinylbenzene alkyl. The stationary phase is electrically neutral and hydrophobic. The DNA, however, is negatively charged at its phosphate groups and therefore can adsorb itself on the column. In order to make the adsorption possible, triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) is used. The positively charged ammonium ion of these molecules interacts with the DNA, and the alkyl chain with the hydrophobic surface of the solid phase. Therefore, when heteroduplexes are partially denaturated by heating, the negative charges undergo partial relocation and the interaction force between DNA heteroduplexes and column decreases in comparison to the strength of interaction of the homoduplexes. These will therefore be eluted less rapidly by the mobile phase (consisting of acetonitrile).

The bomb was released due to engine troubles, and then was destroyed in a non- nuclear detonation before it hit the ground. Background Returning one of several US Mark 4 nuclear bombs secretly deployed at Goose AFB in Labrador, a USAF Boeing B-50 Superfortress had engine trouble and jettisoned the weapon at . The crew set the bomb to self-destruct at , and released it over the St. Lawrence River. The non-nuclear explosion shook area residents and scattered nearly of radioactive uranium (U-238) used in the weapon's tamper. The plutonium core (\\"pit\\"), which is the key component for a nuclear reaction and detonation, was not installed in the bomb at the time. The absence of the core probably was because of its high cost and relative scarcity at the time. Standard US Air Force protocol prohibited any aircraft carrying a nuclear device to land with the device if the aircraft was experiencing engine problems -- it had to be jettisoned. Per standard protocol, the plutonium trigger was always removed prior to flight and shipped separately to prevent accidental nuclear activation. At the time of the incident, the aircraft was returning from Goose AFB to Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base. The troubled aircraft successfully diverted to Loring Air Force Base in Maine. The incident was immediately covered up at the time, and explained away as military practice bombs being detonated. It was not until the 1980s that the Air Force confirmed it had been a nuclear incident.

Welch (born June 21, 1944) is an American physician and researcher specializing in the fields of infant and child development. Welch currently serves as an Associate Professor of Psychiatry in Pediatrics and Pathology & Cell Biology at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), where she is Co- Director of the Nurture Science Program. Welch's research focuses on the biological mechanisms of nurture and the ways they can be utilized to provide new interventions for the prevention and treatment of developmental and behavioral disorders. The term ‚Äònurture‚Äô is used by scientists within the Nurture Science Program to describe mother/parent-infant/child interactions which have a foundational role in promoting optimal emotional and behavioral development, such as holding, touching, breast feeding and communicating emotionally.  Education and early life  Martha Grace Welch was born in Buffalo, New York and raised in Eggertsville, New York. Welch's great, great grandfather, Thomas Bramwell Welch, a physician and a dentist was the inventor of the pasteurization process to prevent the fermentation of grape juice in 1869. Thomas Bramwell, along with his son, Charles Edgar Welch, also a dentist, started Welch's Grape Juice Company in 1893. The company later became Welch's headquartered in Concord, Massachusetts. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1966 from New York University, Welch attended Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, where she earned her medical degree in 1971. Following medical school, Welch completed a residency in General Psychiatry (1972-1974) and a Fellowship in Child Psychiatry (1974-1977) at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. She became a Diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology on November 30, 1977.  Career path  Welch first became interested in the possible treatment of autism during her fellowship. From 1975 to 1997, she operated a private practice, specializing in the treatment of emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders, including autism, maintaining offices in New York City and Greenwich, CT. In 1997, Welch left her practice to pursue a career in academia. She joined the faculty at Columbia University Medical Center's College of Physicians and Surgeons in the Department of Psychiatry. Here, she began preclinical research investigating secretin and oxytocin in the brain and the effects of combined oxytocin/secretin on an animal model of inflammatory bowel disease. In 2004 she began a collaboration with Michael D. Gershon M.D. pioneering research on the role of oxytocin in the gut. Drs. Welch and Gershon later established the Columbia University Brain Gut Initiative to further their understanding the mechanisms of nurture and they condition the brain-gut axis. In 2008 Welch was jointly appointed in Columbia University's Department of Pathology and Cell Biology. In 2010 Welch was jointly appointed in Columbia University's Department of Pediatrics, where she is conducting research on Family Nurture Intervention in the neonatal intensive care unit of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. In 2013, Welch became Co-Director of the Nurture Science Program in the Department of Pediatrics. Welch published the controversial book \\"Holding Time\\" in the 1980s.Welch, M.G. (1989). Holding Time. New York: Fireside. This method involved coercive physical restraint of the child by the mother for an hour each day. Younger children were restrained by the mother's arms while they faced the mother and straddled her lap; older children lay supine while the mother lay prone on top of them. Children resisted and struggled, but eventually became quiet. Welch's book supports claims made by the highly discredited psychoanalyst, Bruno Bettelheim about the etiology and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.Genius Or Fraud?

Interested in research, she moved to the New York Infirmary for Women and Children in New York City where she was awarded a scholarship to study surgery for a year in Vienna. On her return she was appointed chief resident surgeon at the Infirmary. In 1917 she volunteered for overseas service and joined the Women's Overseas Hospitals, an institution which she helped organize, supported by the National Suffrage Associations. Arriving in France on February 18, 1918, and as part of the Tenth Army, she was sent to the Chateau Ognon at Senlis on the front. There, during the great German offensive in the spring and summer, she operated on over 100 casualties in a 24-hour period, and as long as 60 hours at a stretch under enemy fire. For this, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her outstanding bravery and for her record of valour while under the direction of the French government.

Early life Halem was born in Schwetz in West Prussia (present-day ≈öwiecie, Poland). He was the fourth child of Gustav Adolf von Halem (1870‚Äì1932), a Prussian district administrator, and his wife Hertha von Halem, n√©e von Tiedemann (1879‚Äì1957). During the First World War, the family moved to Berlin. As a child Halem was first educated at home, later he attended a gymnasium in Schwetz. After his family moved to Berlin, he attended the Protestant monastery school in Ro√üleben, Thuringia. Having finished high school, in March 1922, he studied law at the University of G√∂ttingen, in Leipzig, Munich, and Heidelberg. During Halem's time at the university he belonged to the Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg student fraternity, but was excluded for intoxication. From 1931 he did his legal clerkship. In the same year he married Marie (Mariechen) Garbe, with whom he had two sons. Politics After his studies, Halem initially joined far-right Black Reichswehr paramilitary troops and became involved in Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch and the Nazis' march on the Munich Feldherrnhalle on 9 November 1923. Later, however, he distanced himself from the rising Nazi Party. From about 1930, he became active in the conservative Catholic circles around scholar Carl von Jordans in Berlin, whose goal was to keep the Nazi movement from power. Through these groups and his legal training he established close contacts with other opponents of the Nazis like Karl Ludwig Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg and Henning von Tresckow. A few months after the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Reich Chancellor and the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Halem quit his legal internship to avoid having to swear allegiance to Hitler. By 1935, under the influence of Ernst Niekisch and Carl von Jordans, Halem already had concluded that killing Hitler was a political necessity to avert a catastrophe. In 1936 Halem served as an official of the Reich Price Commissioner Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who soon after fell out with the Nazi government and was replaced by Josef Wagner. By 1938 Halem acted as a liaison, with his friend Wilhelm von Ketteler, of anti- Nazi groups in Austria. Hitler's plans for the Anschluss annexation of Austria upset Halem, while Ketteler conspired to assassinate the dictator at the time of the German invasion. According to his brother, Halem traveled to Czechoslovakia during the Anschluss in March 1938, to be safe from being arrested by the Gestapo. In 1940 Halem took a leading position in the estate management of his friend Hubert von Ballestrem. This activity served him well as a facade to disguise his renewed activity on assassination planning and goal of political unrest. He took many business trips abroad and used them to contact anti-Nazi groups in England and other countries. Assassination plans Already upon the 1934 Night of the Long Knives, Halem was involved in a plot to assassinate Hitler, together with Josef \\"Beppo\\" R√∂mer, a former Freikorps member like him, which led to R√∂mer's arrest and imprisonment in the Dachau concentration camp until 1939. Upon the Invasion of Poland, both agreed that Hitler's war was a \\"sheer madness\\" and saw the need to end Hitler, the war and to eliminate Nazi governance. Halem offered Josef R√∂mer money to find and hire an assassin who could eliminate Hitler by shooting him or using a grenade. In 1941 Halem broke contact with R√∂mer who agreed to continue with the plan but still hesitated to act. In early 1942, R√∂mer was arrested by the Nazi police and under torture revealed the assassination plot. Halem was arrested on 26 February 1942 by the Gestapo and suffered torture through a number of prisons and concentration camps, including Sachsenhausen, but did not reveal any of his fellow conspirators. In June 1944, shortly before the 20 July 1944 coup attempt, the People's Court indicted Halem for conspiracy to commit treason and undermining the war effort. He was sentenced to death and executed by guillotine in Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison on 9 October 1944. Remembrance In the vicinity of Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin, a street was named Halemweg in 1957. Nearby is the U-Bahn station likewise named Halemweg. In the station is a plaque, erected in honour of Halem's in September 2010.

Early life Adams was born on July 25, 1910 in Kansas City, Missouri. His parents were John Francis Adams and Marian Morse Adams, and his grandfather was Charles Francis Adams Jr., through whom he was a member of the venerable Adams political family of Massachusetts and a descendant of American presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. Adams was graduated from the Groton School and then attended Harvard College. He was a captain in the Army Air Force during World War II, a vice president of the Sheraton Corporation of America from 1954 to 1963, and president of Adams Securities from 1964 to 1968. Career Adams was president of the Massachusetts Historical Society (1957‚Äì1975) and treasurer of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1955‚Äì1990). He was a trustee of the Adams papers (a collection of 300,000 pages of diaries, letters and other writings papers from four generations of his family) and helped organize them for public use. He was a columnist for The Boston Globe from 1974 to 1991. In 1966, Adams, an early and vocal opponent of the Vietnam War, ran a quixotic campaign as a peace candidate for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, against two far better-known candidates: former governor Endicott Peabody and Boston mayor John F. Collins. Adams got about 8% of the vote as Peabody won the nomination (and was easily defeated in turn by Republican Edward Brooke). He ran for Congress in 1968 and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention. As far as is known, he was the last member of the family to run for political office. Personal life Adams was married for 57 years to the former Ramelle Frost Cochrane; the couple had five children. Adams died on June 4, 1997 in Lincoln, Massachusetts.

Dywizja Piechoty) was a reserve unit of the Polish Army in the Second Polish Republic. It did not exist in peacetime organization of the army, and was formed between August 31 - September 4, 1939, during the Invasion of Poland. The division consisted mainly of units which until September 1 manned Fortified Area of Wilno (Obszar Warowny Wilno), and forces of the Border Protection Corps, which guarded northeastern corner of the country. After its formation, the division joined Operational Group Wyszkow. On September 7, 1939, the division, commanded by Colonel Jaroslaw Szafran, was sent to the area south of Bialystok, where it waited for train transports to move it westwards. On the next day however, Polish Commander in Chief Edward Smigly-Rydz ordered the division to march to the rail junction at Czeremcha, where it boarded trains to Lwow, some 500 kilometers south (see also Battle of Lwow (1939)). By September 13, 35th Infantry Division was ready to take part in action. On the next day, it manned western line of defence of the city, and on September 15, it attacked the advancing Wehrmacht in Kortumowa Gora and Holosko. Polish attack, in which bayonets were used, halted the Germans, which had to call for artillery support. On September 18, in order to create a link with 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade, the 35th I.D. attacked along the line Holosko - Brzuchowice. The attack began in the afternoon, and by evening, Polish forces captured complex of a sanatorium along the road to Brzuchowice. Meanwhile, however, 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade was ordered to break through to Hungary. On September 19, Polish defenders of Lwow found out about forces of General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, which tried to break into the city from forests in the area of Jaworow. General Wladyslaw Langner immediately ordered the 35th I.D. to attack German positions near Zamarstynow and Holosko. After initial success, Poles were repelled by German tanks, and failed to aid General Sosnkowski. The 35th I.D., which had used up all its ammunition, capitulated in forests near Brzuchowice. Its commandant, Colonel Jaroslaw Szafran, was later captured by the Soviets, and murdered in Katyn Massacre.

The defendants agreed with the substance of the plaintiffs' case, but asked the district court to stay implementation of any order requiring Colorado to alter enforcement of its ban pending the outcome of other litigation. After the district court declined to grant more than a one-month stay on July 23, the state's governor and attorney general appealed and won a stay from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals on August 21. Following U.S. Supreme Court action in other cases, on October 8 they asked the Tenth Circuit to dismiss their appeal and lift the stay, which would effectively legalize same-sex marriage in Colorado. Complaint The case was filed by attorneys in private practice on July 1, 2014, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs were six same-sex couples. Two of the couples had been refused marriage licenses in Colorado. Another two had been married in California and one on Washington state. The sixth couple, like several others, had a Colorado civil union. The complaint referenced the recent Tenth Circuit decision in Kitchen v. Herbert. The main defendants, the state's governor and attorney general, agreed with the plaintiffs that the court should issue an injunction declaring the same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, but wanted the court to stay that injunction pending resolution of the question by the U.S. Supreme Court. Status conference and hearing On July 15, 2014, U.S. District Judge Raymond P. Moore held an expedited status conference. Since the defendants stipulated that the Colorado same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution, the court considered the state's request for a stay of its injunction ordering Colorado to end its enforcement of its restrictions on the recognition of same-sex marriage. On July 22, Judge Moore heard oral arguments for and against a stay. District court ruling Judge Raymond Moore issued an order in Burns v. Hickenlooper on July 23, granting the plaintiff same-sex couples' motion for a preliminary injunction. In his ruling, Judge Moore noted that the state defendants agreed that the stay should be granted even though they disagreed about Kitchen, with the Attorney General believing the decision incorrect and the governor believing it correctly decided. The judge found the plaintiffs met their burden for an injunction, but denied the defendants' request for a stay. He noted the defendants relied on the fact that most other U.S. courts considering same-sex marriage so far have issued stays and that the U.S. Supreme Court has been staying same-sex marriage cases as well, most recently in Herbert v. Evans. But he declined to deny access to a fundamental right on the part of Coloradans without clear guidance to the contrary from the U.S. Supreme Court. He issued a temporary, one-month stay to give the defendants time to appeal. Appeal and stay The state defendants immediately filed a notice of appeal and applied for a stay in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 21, Circuit Judges Harris Hartz and David Ebel granted the state attorney general's application for a stay. In their order, they cited similar stays granted in Kitchen v. Herbert and Bishop v. Oklahoma upon filing of petitions for certiorari and wrote: \\"[i]n the interests of consistency, we see no reason to deviate from this approach in this case.\\" The judges also noted that one day earlier the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a stay in McQuigg v. Bostic. The Tenth Circuit suspended further proceedings in the case on September 18. On October 6, Colorado Attorney General John Suthers asked the Tenth Circuit to dismiss the state's appeal and lift the stay so that Colorado would be required to recognize same-sex marriage.

In November of 1907, Tibbott scored a touchdown and helped Princeton defeat the Carlisle Indians, starring Jim Thorpe, by a 16-0 score. One newspaper wrote of Tibbott's performance against Carlisle: \\"Tibbott was the slim, wiry Tiger who did most of this work. He played superb football for Princeton on the offense and was a man of might out of all proportion to his bounds.\\" In 1908, Tibbott was selected as a consensus first-team All-American. He did not receive a degree from Princeton, reportedly due to \\"trouble with his eyes in senior year.\\" He left Princeton in December of 1908 and worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Panama Mining Company in Nicaragua, the United States Forestry Service in Colorado, the Norfolk & Portsmouth Traction Co., the Virginia Railway & Power Co., and the Emerson Piano Company in Boston.

Lillian Russell once performed here. The Depression of 1893 curtailed mining activities in the area, though there was a brief resurgence during World War II. By 1952 however, most production had ceased. Geology Following prospecting developments in Hillsboro to the east, silver was discovered in the district in 1880, and extensive mining efforts commenced in 1883. From 1883 to 1893, almost 6,000,000 ounces of silver were produced from 27 mines. From 1934 to 1957, 67,940 ounces of silver were produced, plus 124 ounces of gold. Base metal ores were produced from 1930 to 1949. The Iron King, Empire, and Brush Heap were some of the first mines in the area. Most production was within 460 feet of the surface in the supergene zone. Ore minerals included cerargyrite, native silver, polybasite, and argentiferous galena. From 1952 to 1959, 5,689 tons of manganese ore were produced from the Fusselman Dolomite, mainly from the Iron King Mine. Pyrolusite is the main manganese ore mineral. Ore deposits occurred mainly along major fault fissure veins. These faults may represent the outer margin of the Emory Caldera. Most mineralization occurred in the Late Oligocene. The Lady Franklin Mine was the largest producer of high-grade silver from 1880 to 1893, averaging 15 ounces per ton. Notable Resident *Edward L.

History  Las Palomas, was one the offspring settlements of San Ygnacio de la Alamosa, also known as Alamosa, the original native New Mexican settlement, in what became Sierra County, in 1859. After flooding destroyed Alamosa in 1867 many of its residents moved up the valley to farm near and live in the new town, called Canada Alamosa. That town had been organized by some earlier residents of Alamosa sometime between 1864 and 1866.Wilson, John P., Between the River and the Mountains: A History of Early Settlement in Sierra County, New Mexico, Report #40, John P. Wilson, Las Cruces, New Mexico, August 1985 Others moved across the river to the east bank and downstream a couple of miles to farm on the opposite side of the river and to start a new town first called New Alamosa, but that soon became known as Alamocita. Alamocita was six miles north of Fort McRae which was established in April 1863 to protect these new settlements along the Rio Grande Valley from the Apache, along with the traffic along the river and the old road to the east in the Jornada del Muerto. Also in 1867, a number of the citizens of Canada Alamosa, moved down the Rio Grande to where Palomas Creek had its confluence with the river. There twenty miles south of Fort McRae, it was less exposed to the attacks of the Apache, and easier to reinforce from the fort. There they established the farming settlement first called Plaza del Rio Palomas, later more commonly called Las Palomas. Fort McRae and its garrison would provide its protection and economic benefits to citizens of the towns over the years of its operation until it was closed on October 30, 1876.

Yusuf was a specialist in the study of Hadith (Prophetic tradition): he earned the title \\"Mumtaz al-Muhaddethin\\" for his advanced degree in hadith sciences, and has also published books widely in the field. Yusuf has traveled widely and represented Bangladesh at numerous national and international forums. He served as the Chairman of Bangladesh Peasants' Welfare Society for over 35 years, the Chairman of Darul-Arabia wa Darul-Ifta Bangladesh for more than 30 years, and as a senior official of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh in various capacities for more than 60 years. Implicated for war crimes he was allegedly party to in the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh, the International Crimes Tribunal, a domestic war crimes tribunal in Bangladesh set up specifically to investigate and prosecute suspects for the genocide committed in 1971, indicted him on 13 charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. He died in custody on 9 February 2014. Early life and education Maulana Abul Kalam Muhammad Yusuf hailed from the village of Rajair (Sarankhala), Bagerhat district in Bangladesh. He completed his primary education from his village school and later from a school at Rayenda. His secondary level schooling was completed from Galua Madrasa Barisal, followed by the Sharshina Aliya Madrasa and finally Amtali Madrasa in Barisal, where he began his education in nahw and sarf (Arabic grammar and morphology), as well as hadith and Qur'anic tafseer. Yusuf completed his undergraduate (Fazil) and graduate (Kamil) levels education in Alia Madrasa situated in Dhaka. In 1950, he achieved 1st position in the country on the basis of merit in the Fazil (Honors) examination under the East Pakistan Madrasa Board. Following this, he completed his graduate (Kamil) examinations in 1952, attaining recognition as Mumtaz al-Muhaddethin, the highest distinction available to scholars of Islam in South Asia. He started his profession as a madrasa teacher in 1952 and became the principal of Khulna Alia Madrasa in 1958. He also taught at Tikikata Senior Madrasa in Mothbaria (Barisal), where he served as Head Master. Leadership of various social institutions Yusuf headed the Bangladesh Peasants' Welfare Society (BPWS) (), which he founded in 1977 as a non-government and non-profit social welfare organization. He has also founded and chaired an Arabic-research and fatwa institute called Darul-Arabia wa Darul-Ifta situated in Dhaka. Since its founding, the institute has become a renowned center for the translation of classical Arabic and Islamic literature authored by well-known scholars into Bengali and also publishes \\"Al-Huda\\", an Arabic language monthly from Bangladesh. It has a wide circulation in the Middle East. Leadership in Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh Yusuf joined the Jamaat-e-Islami in 1952. Rising quickly within its ranks, he was Ameer of the Khulna Division of the party from 1956 until October 1958. In October 1958, all parties were banned in the aftermath of the declaration of martial law in Pakistan by President Ayub Khan. After martial law was lifted Yusuf was appointed as the Naib-e-Ameer (Vice President) for the party's East Pakistan division. From 1962, until the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, he was also a member of Jamaat's Majlis-e- Shura (Central Executive Council) for three consecutive full terms, under the leadership of Sayyid Abul A'la Maududi (Maududi). After 1971, Yusuf served in various capacities in providing senior leadership for Jamaat. He was selected Secretary General for one term under Ameer Maulana Abdur Rahim. He again served in the same capacity for three consecutive terms under Jamaat Ameer Ghulam Azam and was elected as Senior Naib-e-Ameer during the second tenure of Ameer Maulana Motiur Rahman Nizami. He continued in this role until his death. Political career In the 1962 elections, Yusuf was nominated by Jamaat to run on behalf of his constituency Khulna and Barisal. Taking leave of absence from his teaching position at the Alia Madrasa, he contested the elections and won. At 35 years of age, he was at the time the youngest representative in the National Assembly of Pakistan. He actively participated in the civil unrest movement against dictator Ayub Khan in the 1960s and was part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) from 1965 to 1968 and later of the Democratic Action Committee (DAC), working alongside notable leaders such as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ataur Rahman Khan, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Chowdhury Golam Mohammad and many others. Role during Liberation War During the war, he became a member of the Abdul Motaleb Malik-led cabinet and served as Revenue Minister. However, all the cabinet members had resigned on 14 December, only two days before the country's independence, as they \\"decided to resign observing the country's situation,\\". Due to his high-profile political stance during the war, Yusuf was identified among 14 top collaborators who were ordered to surrender after promulgation of the Collaborators Act 1972. The list was made addressing Yusuf himself, Nurul Amin, Ghulam Azam, Khan A Sabur, Shah Azizur Rahman, Maulana Muhammad Ishaq, Khawaja Khayeruddin, Mahmud Ali, Abbas Ali Khan and many others as collaborators. Awami League leader Obaydullah Mazumder of Feni was among the list of the collaborators. Fifty thousand collaborators were arrested under the Collaborators Act 1972, among whom 752 were found guilty and were sentenced to varying degrees of imprisonment. Yusuf, despite his political stance of opposing the war of independence, was among those who received Mujibur Rahman's general amnesty in 1973 following a period of imprisonment in lieu of absence of any charges of killing, rape, loot or arson against him during the war. War Crimes trial =Arrest= On 12 May 2013, Bangladeshi police arrested Yusuf in Dhaka on charges of war crimes, charging him with 15 crimes dating back to Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence with Pakistan, including genocide, killing, looting, arson and forcing members of minority faiths to convert to Islam. Police alleged that he was the founder of the infamous Razakar Bahini, who were notorious for their operations that targeted Hindus as well as civilians suspected of being sympathetic towards Bengali nationalists. =Charges= According to the prosecution, Yusuf had formed the first team of Razakars (volunteers) on 5 May 1971 with 96 members of Jamaat in Khulna. He started gathering people for the force on 18 April. Yusuf was also reported as the regional chief of anti-liberation force Peace Committee, facing 15 war crimes charges, which included genocide, killing, looting, arson and forcing members of minority faiths to convert to Islam. His defence team argued that Yusuf, then 87, required to be granted bail immediately because of his old age. Prosecutors however opposed the bail application, arguing that Yusuf had remained politically active despite his advancing years and should remain in jail to prevent him influencing trial proceedings. Subsequently, his bail was rejected and he was sent to jail. Death Funeral of AKM Yusuf, He died while in custody. On the morning of 9 February 2014, Yusuf, a survivor of two previous heart surgeries, suffered a fatal stroke while in prison custody. He was taken to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) hospital at around 11 a.m. that day, after falling ill in his prison cell at Kashimpur central jail, about from Dhaka, where doctors subsequently pronounced him dead. Books Yusuf is a well-known scholar in his own right and published several widely read books, including titles on Qur'anic studies and hadith. Along with writing a couple of travelogues and a memoir, he also published analytic essays on national and international politics. Personal life Yusuf married in 1949.
