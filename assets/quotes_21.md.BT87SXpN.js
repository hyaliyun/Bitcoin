It was a Generation III+ integral pressurized water reactor (light water reactor) concept. In March 2017 Bechtel withdrew from the joint venture and the project was terminated. History The reactor was unveiled by Babcock & Wilcox in June 2009. In July 2010, Babcock & Wilcox announced a formal alliance with Bechtel called Generation mPower LLC. At the same time, Babcock & Wilcox announced that it will build a test facility for the mPower reactor design at the Center for Advanced Engineering and Research in Bedford County, Virginia. In April 2011, Babcock & Wilcox received a $5 million grant from the Virginia Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalisation Commission for this test facility. In June 2011 Generation mPower signed a letter of intent with the Tennessee Valley Authority for constructing up to six reactors at Clinch River Breeder Reactor site in Tennessee. Generation mPower planned to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for design certification by 2013. Babcock & Wilcox announced on February 20, 2013, that they had contracted with the Tennessee Valley Authority to apply for permits to build an mPower small modular reactor at TVA's Clinch River site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In November 2012, mPower won a US Department of Energy funding competition for new Small modular reactor (SMR) designs. The competition was intended to accelerate development of SMRs. The award was funded at $79 million in 2013, from a total of $150 million over five years, with a possibility of total government grants reaching $226 million or more. In 2013 Babcock & Wilcox had intended to sell a majority stake in the mPower joint venture, but in February 2014 announced it was unable to find a buyer. In February 2014, Jim Ferland, B&W;'s CEO, announced that spending on the mPower reactor development will be decreased by 75%. The official explanation was that the company had failed in its effort to find additional major investors to participate in the project. In April 2014, Babcock & Wilcox announced it was scaling back investment in the programme, projecting investment of up to $15 million annually. It stated: In March 2017 Bechtel withdrew from the joint venture, citing the inability to find a utility company that would provide a site for a first reactor and an investor. The development project was terminated, with Babcock & Wilcox paying Bechtel a $30 million settlement. Design B&W; mPower was a Generation III+ integral pressurized water reactor (light water reactor) with a modular design. The reactor and steam generator would be located in a single integrated reactor vessel located in an underground containment facility that would store all of the spent fuel. The modular unit had a diameter of and it was high. The reactor core was . The steam generator was similar to Once Through Steam Generators (OTSG) used in existing B&W; plants (i.e. Three Mile island). The unit had an air-cooled condenser giving 31% thermal efficiency, and passive safety systems. The reactor was planned to have a rated electrical output of 125‚Äì180 MWe. When originally announced, the reactor had planned capacity of 125 MWe. Later the power was increased to 160 MWe and then to 180 MWe. In its pre-application design certification interaction to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the reactor's rated capacity was described as 500 MWt of thermal power and 160 MWe of electrical power. The reactor was designed for an expected lifetime of 60 years. Fuel and refueling B&W; mPower uses standard fuel enriched to 5%, similar to the fuel loaded in the other PWRs. It was designed for a 4-year refueling cycle. In the process of refuelling, the entire core will be completely removed in a single evolution, and replaced in a second separate evolution, making the core nearly \\"plug and play\\", unlike traditional reactors, which require fuel handling and movement of individual fuel rods during a refueling outage. The entire used core, once removed, can be placed in storage in the spent fuel pool next to the IRV in the containment, which was designed to hold an entire 60 years worth of used fuel, and was accessible by the containment gantry crane located above the IRV within the containment. Thermal hydraulics The mPower incorporates several features of the boiling water reactor (BWR). Like a BWR, the mPower reactor's primary coolant/moderator was highly purified water (with no boric acid). The Reactor Water Cleanup System ensures that primary system water remains pure. Similar to the ABWR, the mPower reactor had integral coolant recirculation pumps inside the Integral Reactor Vessel (IRV). The mPower reactor control rods are inserted from the top of the core and insert upon scram under gravity. All of the primary coolant was in the liquid phase during normal operation. The integral once-through steam generator was an advanced derivative of the steam generators used in older B&W; designs (Davis Besse). Control rod drives do not penetrate the IRV, as in the light water reactors of today, but are instead wholly enclosed within the IRV. Burnable neutron absorbers within the fuel and control rod inventory are used to suppress hot excess reactivity. Cold shut-down was accomplished with control rod insertion (as in BWRs). The mPower was designed to produce superheated steam and would not require steam separators and dryers prior to admitting steam into the high-pressure turbine. Safety The mPower was designed to eliminate the potential loss of coolant accidents as the integral reactor vessel would not have large cold or hot leg piping; it contains the entire primary coolant loop within the reactor pressure vessel with automatic primary loop depressurization. If secondary cooling was lost, creating an effective loss of standard heat removal, there are water supplies located above and within the containment that can cool the vessel with gravity-driven cooling. Heat removal can be used in the event that these systems are exhausted, such as by flooding the containment and establishing natural circulation, as no electrically driven pumps are required.

Originally released in 1971, it covers the life and career of film director John Ford. Production Bogdanovich first met John Ford in 1963, on the set of Ford's film Cheyenne Autumn, interviewing the veteran filmmaker for a piece in Esquire magazine, one in a series of profiles of famous directors. Ford, who typically despised interviews, perversely decided to be accommodating after he witnessed a production assistant warning Bogdanovich and his then- wife Polly Platt about Ford's difficult nature.McBride, Joseph. Searching for John Ford: a life, Macmillan, 2001, p. 655. Ford occasionally found himself exasperated by Bogdanovich's questions, but also enjoyed his company, and amused himself by needling the young man and pulling his leg.McBride, p. 656. Bogdanovich's Esquire piece temporarily produced some measure of friction between the two, as Bogdanovich did not remove the profanity from Ford's quotes in his initial draft, to Ford's displeasure. Ford described it as \\"nauseating\\".McBride, p. 660. He was also unhappy with the tone of the piece, entitled \\"The Autumn of John Ford\\", because he resented the implication that his time as a director was nearing its end. Despite this, Bogdanovich and Ford remained friends. In 1967, Bogdanovich completed an interview book about Ford, which was published in England.McBride, p. 684. Ford affected a lack of interest in the work, describing it as \\"a caricature\\" and claiming that he threw his copy away after reading the first three pages, though in reality, he purchased more than 200 copies.McBride, pp. 684-685. The next year, Bogdanovich began working on Directed by John Ford. Bogdanovich conducted interviews with actors Henry Fonda, James Stewart, and John Wayne, as well as Ford himself.Modderno, Craig. \\"Director Bogdanovich Revives His John Ford Film\\", Reuters, November 23, 2006. Orson Welles delivered an original narration, which was recorded in a Howard Johnson's while Welles was directing The Other Side of the Wind, during a 20-minute break in filming. Bogdanovich also interviewed Ford in Monument Valley, a location Ford had used in some of his own films, producing footage that Bogdanovich described as \\"one of the funnier sequences in the picture\\".Lammers, Tim. \\"Bogdanovich Points 'John Ford' In Right Direction - Documentary About Film Icon Restructured 35 Years After Original \\", WESH.com (WESH TV, Orlando, Florida), November 7, 2006. Ford, who was partially deaf and who did not enjoy discussing his work, would routinely make interviewers sit on the side of his bad ear, and then indicate that he was unable to understand the questions he was being asked.MacNab, Geoffrey. \\"John Ford: Ford focus\\", The Independent, July 14, 2006. Whenever his interrogators ultimately succeeded in making themselves understood, he would deliver only monosyllabic responses. Ford's behavior in his interview with Bogdanovich accordingly delivered little useful information, but it pleased Bogdanovich anyway because he felt that it was an accurate depiction of Ford's character. During production, the American Film Institute exhausted its funding, and was unable to purchase the rights to the film clips of Ford's work used in the documentary. As a result, the film could only be shown in non-profit venues, such as free screenings at film festivals or one fundraiser for PBS. For this reason, it was rarely seen after its initial release. Revised version Bogdanovich had long been dissatisfied with the initial version of the film, for several reasons. In addition to the rights issues, he felt that some of the film clips used came across as \\"a little long and lugubrious\\", and he was unhappy that the film did not go into sufficient depth when exploring certain aspects of Ford's personal life, which were either unknown at the time the film was made or too controversial to include during Ford's lifetime. The original version of Directed by John Ford was shown at the 1999 Telluride Film Festival, garnering a strong positive reaction, and this success led Bogdanovich to believe that a re-edited version might be a viable option. He delivered a pitch to producer Frank Marshall, an old friend with whom he had first worked on the 1968 film Targets, promising to \\"use all the good stuff and do some interviews with new people and jazz it up a little bit and make it more commercial, faster and incisive, and also more revealing.\\" Marshall, in turn, brokered a deal with Turner Classic Movies and Warner Home Video. When re-editing the film, Bogdanovich started with the original set of interviews with Fonda, Ford, Stewart, and Wayne, as well as the Welles narration. To supplement them, he conducted additional interviews with actors Harry Carey, Jr., Clint Eastwood and Maureen O'Hara, and directors Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Walter Hill. He also recorded some additional commentary of his own. The revised documentary was subsequently aired on the Turner Classic Movies channel, as part of a month-long tribute to Ford. Critical reception =1971 version= An unattributed review in Time magazine characterized the initial cut of the film as a \\"piece of lightweight scholarship\\", in which Ford's \\"every blemish is a virtue, and no detail is too trivial to examine.\\"\\"Festival (Contd.)\\", Time magazine, October 8, 1971. Though dismissive of Bogdanovich's critical analysis within the film, the reviewer was more positive about the interview segments, in which Fonda, Stewart, and Wayne displayed the \\"terror and awe\\" of young and callow actors when discussing Ford. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, critic Roger Greenspun praised it as \\"workmanlike, amusing, [and] instructive,\\" and noted that on several occasions he was \\"moved literally to tears\\" while watching it.Greenspun, Roger. \\"Directed By John Ford\\", The New York Times, October 7, 1971. However, he also expressed disappointment that the film did not place the end of Ford's career into what he felt to be the proper context, ignoring films such as Donovan's Reef and 7 Women, and glossing over the modest critical and box-office reception that characterized the end of Ford's career. Ford was honored at a high-profile Hollywood event on November 23, 1973, which included a showing of Directed by John Ford. When asked what he had thought of the film, Ford had said that it was \\"long, and the print was bad\\".Levy, Bill. John Ford: A Bio-Bibliography, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p. 35. =2006 version= In a review published in Variety, Todd McCarthy was largely positive. He praised the interviews with Fonda, Stewart, and Wayne, describing them as \\"possessing an extraordinary here-and-now immediacy\\", and found the interview with Ford \\"hilarious\\".McCarthy, Todd. \\"Directed by John Ford\\", Variety, September 6, 2006. He was less enthusiastic about some of the newer interviews, which were shot on video, feeling that they lacked the \\"vibrant look\\" and \\"elegant mobility\\" of the earlier interviews, recorded on film by a dolly-mounted camera. He did, however, single out Lindsay Anderson's 1992 interview with Maureen O'Hara, a deathbed recording of Ford speaking with Katharine Hepburn, and a more honest treatment of Ford's personal life illustrated by scenes from How Green Was My Valley as worthwhile additions to the updated version. Bogdanovich and Ford According to Bogdanovich, Ford was instrumental in breaking up a planned film, The Streets of Laredo (after the song of that name), that Bogdanovich would have directed. It was to have starred Fonda, Stewart, and Wayne, but Bogdanovich claims that Ford talked Wayne out of participating, causing the project's collapse. Bogdanovich voiced the belief that the work \\"would have been my masterpiece,\\" but was unwilling to speak about Ford's motives in acting as he did. The screenplay, written by Larry McMurtry, author of the source novel of Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, would become the basis of McMurtry's novel Lonesome Dove. Bogdanovich later developed a one-man stage show called Sacred Monsters, in which he related anecdotes about his filmmaking career and performed impressions, including one of Ford.Lemire, Christy. \\"Bogdanovich on Filmmaking and \`Sopranos',\\" The Associated Press, November 8, 2006.

Structurally similar to paraherquamides, they are a small class compounds that contain a bicyclo[2.2.2]diazoctane ring system. One of the major secondary metabolites in Penicillium spores, they are responsible for inflammatory response in lung cells. History Originally isolated from Pennicillum compactum in 1969, brevianamide A has shown insecticidal activity. Further studies showed that a minor secondary metabolite, brevianamide B, has an epimeric center at the spiro-indoxyl quaternary center. Both were found to fluoresce under long-wave ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, under irradaton, brevianamide A has been shown to isomerize to brevianamide B.  Biosynthesis  While the biosynthesis has not been conclusively elucidated, brevianamide A and B are constructed from tryptophan, proline, and an isoprene unit. Total synthesis The total synthesis of several brevianamides have been reported, for brevianamide-B and for brevianamide-E.  Biological activity  Tests for antibiotic effectiveness against E. coli, A. fecalis, B. subtilis, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa were negative. Also, no inhibitory action was shown against A. niger, A. flavis, P. crustosum, F. graminearum, F. moniliforme, Alternara sp., and Cladosporium sp. However, some insecticidal activity has been shown in one study, possibly showing some use as an insecticide for food crops. In mammalian (mice lung cell) studies, brevianamide A has shown to induce cytoxicity in cells. Furthermore, ELISA assays showed elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-A), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Therefore, brevianamide A may not be a suitable insecticide in food crops.

Although its prevalence is unknown, it being classified as a \\"rare disease\\" means that less than 200,000 of the population of the United States are affected by this condition and its subtypes. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of the disease include diarrhea, nausea, swelling of the legs, protein-losing enteropathy, immunodeficiency and loss of lymphatic fluid into the intestines. It is usually diagnosed before the patient is 3 years old, but it is sometimes diagnosed in adults.  Pathophysiology  The illness is usually caused by lymphatic vessels that were misshaped at birth, causing obstruction and subsequent enlargement. The condition can also be a result of other illnesses such as constrictive pericarditis and pancreatitis. Diagnosis The disease is diagnosed by doing a biopsy of the affected area. Severity of the disease is then determined by measuring alpha1-antitrypsin proteins in a stool sample. Management Once the main cause of the disease is treated, a diet of low- fat and high-protein aliments, supplemental calcium and certain vitamins has been shown to reduce symptom effects. This diet, however, is not a cure. If the diet is stopped, the symptoms will eventually reappear. History The disease was first reported in 1961 by T.A. Waldmann. He described 18 cases of patients having a low level 131I-albumin. Biopsies of the small intestine were examined under the microscope and found various levels of dilatation of the lymph vessels.

Edwin Lewis Snyder (July 2, 1887 ‚Äì March 28, 1969) was an architect and pioneer in the use of Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture, building homes in Northern California for decades from the early to mid-twentieth century. The Snyder- designed Berkeley Community YWCA,http://berkeleyheritage.com/berkeley_landmarks/images/Roberts_Studio1.jpg built in 1930, is on the city's historical register; the Roy O. Long Co. Building, built in 1927, is on the California Historical Resources Inventory.http://www.ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=1068 Along with Frederick L. Confer (designer of the Tao House), Snyder designed several ‚Äúwestern colonial‚Äù homes during the depression. Snyder designed the Alpha Delta Pi sorority house in Berkeley, excluding architect‚Äôs fees, the English cottage style structure was made for $27,500. Snyder was strongly influenced by a six-week visit to Majorca, a Spanish island in the Mediterranean, where he visited Palma (Majorca), Dei√†, Estellencs, and Formentor. He found homes he described as ‚Äúarchitecturally perfect‚Äù featuring pergolas, Dado (architecture), tile roofs, windows that ran to the floor, with white-washed finishes. These features were included in his later California works. Snyder‚Äôs designs placed first and second in the 1932 Small House Exhibition in Oakland, CA. The first place award was for a ranch house built for his colleague Confer; it featured typical traits of early California architecture‚Äîa clay tile roof, a large brick fireplace, and a sunroom. In 1935, editors of Sunset Magazine reviewed the design of Snyder's own home: \\"By skillful planning and execution, Mr. Snyder has achieved a house that has all of the informal charm of a tiny cottage and at the same time the spaciousness that comes in larger dwellings.\\" Landscape architect Garrett Eckbo designed the landscaping for the house, which has a view of the San Francisco Bay from the Berkeley Hills. An advocate of housing for low-income families, Snyder designed low-cost homes for the National Housing Bureau. He emphasized that low-income housing should have standard design elements, but different architectural design. A veteran of both World War I and II, Snyder operated his own architecture practice in Carmel, CA, from 1942 to 1961, when he moved to Lodi, CA to retire. He was a former member and past president of the Architectural Honor Society. Snyder was born in Stockton, California and received his degree in architecture from the University of California, Berkeley in 1909.

Transportation  The route along the old road that leads to the village of Lysos, and from there to Pelathousa, ending in Polis Chrysochous, is considered one of the most beautiful routes on the island. Finally, Peristerona Paphou is adjacent to Steni Paphou, next to Meladeia and very close to the villages of Trimithousa and Filousa Chrysochous. Peristerona is located 408 m above sea level.

This interest is partly motivated by the strong physiological effects of cocaine, but a further incentive was the unusual bicyclic structure of the molecule. The biosynthesis can be viewed as occurring in two phases, one phase leading to the N-methylpyrrolinium ring, which is preserved in the final product. The second phase incorporates a C4 unit with formation of the bicyclic tropane core. Biosynthesis of N-methyl-pyrrolinium cation The biosynthesis begins with L-glutamine, which is derived from L-ornithine in plants. The roles of L-ornithine and L-arginine was confirmed by Edward Leete. Ornithine then undergoes a PLP-dependent decarboxylation to form putrescine. In animals, however, the urea cycle derives putrescine from ornithine. L-Ornithine is converted to L-arginine, which is then decarboxylated via PLP to form agmatine. Hydrolysis of the imine derives N-carbamoylputrescine followed with hydrolysis of the urea to form putrescine. The separate pathways of converting ornithine to putrescine in plants and animals have converged. A SAM-dependent N-methylation of putrescine gives the N-methylputrescine, which then undergoes oxidative deamination by the action of diamine oxidase to yield the aminoaldehyde, which spontaneously cyclizes to N-methyl-Œî1-pyrrolinium cation. S-adenosyl methionine. Beyond its role in cocaine, the N-methyl-pyrrolinium cation is a precursor to nicotine, hygrine, cuscohygrine, and other natural products. Conversion of N-methyl-pyrrolinium cation to the tropane The additional carbon atoms required for the synthesis of cocaine are derived from acetyl-CoA, by addition of two acetyl-CoA units to the N-methyl-Œî1-pyrrolinium cation. The first addition is a Mannich-like reaction with the enolate anion from acetyl-CoA acting as a nucleophile towards the pyrrolinium cation. The second addition occurs through a Claisen condensation. This produces a racemic mixture of the 2-substituted pyrrolidine, with the retention of the thioester from the Claisen condensation. In formation of tropinone from racemic ethyl [2,3-13C2]4(Nmethyl- 2-pyrrolidinyl)-3-oxobutanoate there is no preference for either stereoisomer. In the biosynthesis of cocaine, however, only the (S)-enantiomer can cyclize to form the tropane ring system of cocaine. The stereoselectivity of this reaction was further investigated through study of prochiral methylene hydrogen discrimination. This is due to the extra chiral center at C-2. This process occurs through an oxidation, which regenerates the pyrrolinium cation and formation of an enolate anion, and an intramolecular Mannich reaction. The tropane ring system undergoes hydrolysis, SAM-dependent methylation, and reduction via NADPH for the formation of methylecgonine. The benzoyl moiety required for the formation of the cocaine diester is synthesized from phenylalanine via cinnamic acid. Benzoyl-CoA then combines the two units to form cocaine. S-adenosyl methionine. Chemical synthesis The synthesis and structure elucidation of cocaine was reported by Richard Willst√§tter in 1898. Willst√§tter's synthesis derived cocaine from tropinone. Robert Robinson and Edward Leete also made significant contributions.

The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 79 in downtown Ithaca. Its eastern terminus was at a junction with NY 366 in the hamlet of Varna, located within the town of Dryden. NY 392 served as a connector between Ithaca, Varna, and the campus of Cornell University. The routing of NY 392 was originally part of NY 13 in the 1920s. NY 13 was realigned in the mid-1930s to bypass Cornell University from the south, at which time the portion of its former alignment from Stewart Avenue to Varna was redesignated as NY 392\\\\. The route was extended southwest into downtown Ithaca over the remainder of NY 13's former routing in the mid-1960s before it was removed on July 1, 1974. All of former NY 392 is now locally maintained. Route description NY 392 began at an intersection with westbound NY 79 (West Seneca Street) in downtown Ithaca. It headed north on Cayuga Street for two blocks, then cut eastward on Court Street for four blocks to its end at Linn Street. NY 392 turned back to the north, following Linn Street for one block before veering northeast onto University Avenue. At Lake Street, University Avenue turned east; however, NY 392 continued northeast on Willard Way to Stewart Avenue. The route turned south on Stewart Avenue for one block to its junction with University Avenue. Here, NY 392 rejoined University Avenue and headed eastward onto the campus of Cornell University. Within the Cornell University grounds, NY 392 paralleled Fall Creek as it headed eastward. It became Forest Home Drive upon intersecting East Avenue. The route continued along the southern bank of the creek for roughly before crossing the waterway and entering the hamlet of Forest Home. Its stay in the community was brief as it turned to the southeast and crossed back over Fall Creek shortly afterward. NY 392 continued eastward on Forest Home Road along the southern edge of the creek to the hamlet of Varna (within the town of Dryden), where it ended at a junction with NY 366. History In 1924, NY 13 was assigned to an alignment extending from the city of Elmira in the south to the village of Cazenovia in the north by way of the city of Ithaca. The route initially entered the city of Ithaca on Spencer Street. NY 13 continued through downtown Ithaca on Cayuga, Court, and Linn Streets to University Avenue. From there, the route went through the campus of Cornell University on University Avenue (via Willard Way) and Forest Home Drive. NY 13 followed Forest Home Drive into the town of Dryden and to the hamlet of Varna, where it turned northeastward onto Dryden Road. NY 13 was realigned to bypass the Cornell University campus to the south. The former alignment of NY 13 from downtown Ithaca to the junction of Willard Way and Stewart Avenue became part of NY 34A while the remainder was redesignated as NY 392. NY 34A was realigned in the early 1940s to follow Stewart Avenue south of NY 392, resulting in the truncation of NY 392 to the intersection of University and Stewart Avenues. In the mid-1960s, NY 34A was removed and NY 392 was extended southwestward to NY 79 in downtown Ithaca over what had been the routing of NY 13 during the 1920s and 1930s. The NY 392 designation was removed entirely on July 1, 1974. All of NY 392 is now locally maintained by the city of Ithaca, the town of Ithaca, and the town of Dryden.

Built in 1793, it is the only surviving building from Washington Academy. It is the eighth-oldest academic building in the United States that is still in use for its original academic purpose and is the oldest surviving college building west of the Allegheny Mountains. The building is situated on the corner of South Lincoln Street and East Wheeling Street in Washington, Pennsylvania. It is by in size. McMillan Hall is named after College founder and Presbyterian missionary John McMillan. Throughout its history, McMillan has also been known as the \\"Old College,\\" the \\"Academy Building,\\" and the \\"Administration Building.\\" It is currently home to administrative offices, including the Office of Communications and the Office of the President. The College's ceremonial mace is carved from the original wooden pillars. In 1977, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register described the building's architecture as achieving a \\"unique quality and charm from the fact that vernacular builders selectively borrowed Georgian, Roman Classical, Adamesque, and other European Renaissance architectural forms, elements, and details and combined them in the builder's own esoteric way.\\" The National Register described its historical importance as a \\"unique variation of a Western Pennsylvania stone building,\\" calling it \\"irreplaceable on a regional or national level.\\" In 1793, the Trustees of Washington Academy authorized the construction of a new building. Alexander Hamilton and Henry Lee stayed in the hall during their visit during Whiskey Rebellion. The 2-story stone building was ready for occupation in 1797. Two wings and a portico were added in 1818, allowing the building to house dormitories and dining facilities for students. In 1900, the building was saved from planned demolition by a benefactor who insisted that it be preserved. In order to make room for the proposed library, it was moved towards Lincoln Street. The building was remodeled in 1912 to house administrative offices. In 1928, the north wing, which had been used as student housing, was remodeled to create office space. At various times, the basement housed a dining hall, a lunch counter, classrooms, and the bookstore. It was restored to its 18th-century appearance in the late 1980s. It is designated as a historic public landmark by the Washington County History & Landmarks Foundation. History =Initial construction= In 1791, a fire destroyed the original log Washington County Courthouse, leaving Washington Academy without anywhere to hold classes. In 1793, the Trustees of Washington Academy authorized three men, James Brice, Absolom Baird and David Bradford, to form a committee to build and superintend a new building built on property donated by William Hoge. The foundation and walls of that building were finished in the fall of that year. On March 4, 1794, the Trustees entered into a contract with William Sherrard to complete the stone building, which was in size and stood two stories. It is believed that the building had an external staircase, but this is unclear. The building was placed into use for the first time on April 10, 1797. In addition to having a library and a reading room for students, the main hall was used as a Presbyterian place of worship. =Expansion= The \\"Old College\\" in 1899, still in its original location. On March 28, 1806, Washington Academy was chartered as Washington College. A decade later, on June 24, 1816, the College's Committee of Buildings began planning to expand the building by adding two wings and a two-story portico with four Tuscan columns. Following the completion of the wings in 1819, the College was carrying $3,004.18 in construction debt owed to the workmen. In 1835, constructing began on a new building, called the \\"New College.\\" Up until then, the original building, which was now referred to as the \\"Old College,\\" had been the only building on the campus of Washington College. These additions were used as dormitories and dining facilities for the students, while the second floor was sealed off from use. In May 1826, the interior of the original center portion of the building was renovated. During his tenure, President David McConaughy lived rent-free in the south wing. Plans to enlarge the dormitories facilities, including the possibility of using the entire building as a boarding house, were discussed in 1848 and 1849. =Movement and re-dedication= In the late 1890s, the Board of Trustees was considering demolishing the \\"Academy Building,\\" which then housed the library. However, the building was saved in 1900 when College benefactor W. R. Thompson donated $50,000 for the construction of a new library with the stipulation that the Academy Building be preserved. In order for make way for the new library, the Academy Building was moved to the east and towards Lincoln Street by the John Eichley Corporation of Pittsburgh. After the move, the new foundation was of incorrect proportions, requiring the contractor to keep the building mounted on \\"skids and jacks\\" while a new foundation was constructed. The error cost the contractor dearly, and the whole operation cost the College $7,455.69. Photograph from the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934 The building was remodeled in 1912, opening the second floor for use for the first time since 1835 and adding an interior stairway. The funds for this remodeling project were donated by President James D. Moffat. The interior was painted while and the first floor received new fixtures, including new railings, partitions, and windows. It was rechristened the \\"Administrative Building,\\" because it then housed all of the administrative offices, including the President's office. The \\"Administration Committee\\" met on the second floor. A cement walkway was added to connect the building to Old Main. Other proposals asked that the center portion of the building be used as \\"the long wanted student smoking room on the campus.\\" In 1928, the north wing was converted from a residence hall into office space, while the south wing continued to be used as a faculty residence. In 1937, the building was repainted and refurbished with new floor coverings. The College bookstore opened in the basement in 1938 and was enlarged in 1939 to add a refreshment and lunch counter. In 1942, a room under the South wing was turned into a classroom and a faculty dining room was added. With the increased enrollment after World War II, the building's dining hall was moved to the Chapel in Old Main and the bookstore was moved to Hays Hall, allowing the former bookstore location to become part of the faculty dining hall. The south wing faculty residence hall was converted into office space in 1947, with administration office on the first floor and faculty offices on the second floor. By 1949, the entire building was used for administrative offices. By 1952, the postwar enrollment figures had stabilized, allowing the bookstore to reopen in the basement and the dining hall to return to Hayes Hall. =Restoration= A major renovation project, lasting from 1985 to 1987, restored the building to its original 18th-century condition. Non-original walls and partitions were removed, opening the hallways in the two wings for free movement, and the main lobby and first floor foyer were restored. For the exterior, the roof, soffit, and facis were repaired and the brickwork was repainted in a Colonial ivory. The three porches, on the front and one on each wing, and the chestnut pillars were restored and reconstructed. The basement was converted into offices for the clerical staff and the mailroom. The electrical wiring, ventilation system, telephone, and switchboard system were replaced. Overall, this restoration cost $800,000 and was funded by private sources generated through the College's \\"Century III Fund\\" capital campaign. The newly restored building housed the President's Office and other administrative offices, including Development, Public Information, and Admissions Offices. It also served as a welcome center for prospective students and campus visitors. On Founders Day 1993, the building was rededicated as John McMillan Hall.

Hooper and the volatile Michael A. Healy. She continued operating in the Bering Sea as a merchant and charter vessel after she was sold in 1900. As a merchant vessel, the SS Corwin started out as a support vessel for minerals exploration, and subsequently was extensively modified to carry passengers. She served coastal ports on Norton and Kotzebue Sounds, the Seward Peninsula, and the Bering Strait during the shipping season, and generally wintered in Puget Sound. She was the first steamer to reach Nome in the spring multiple years, and also frequently the last steamer out in the fall. Her Master through most of her commercial service was Ellsworth Luce West. She attempted to rescue the Karluk survivors from Wrangel Island and participated in the search for four missing Karluk crewmen in 1914. Construction The Corwin was named for Thomas Corwin, a well-known mid-nineteenth-century politician who served as Secretary of the Treasury during Millard Fillmore's presidency. She was the second of three Revenue Cutter Service and Coast Guard vessels to bear the name (there was also a patrol boat Cape Corwin).US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a,c) She was built as a single-screw steam-powered topsail schooner by Oregon Iron Works at Albina (Portland) Oregon in 1876 and commissioned at San Francisco in 1877.US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)Tacoma Public Library (a) She was constructed of fir and \\"fastened with copper, galvanized iron, and locust tree nails\\".Nourse Her appearance was typical of revenue cutters of the period, flush-decked (or nearly so) with clipper bow, fantail stern, two sail-bearing masts, pilot house and funnel amidships and a deckhouse (probably including the upper parts of the engine and boiler rooms) beneath and extending behind the pilot house. The boiler powering the propulsion machinery was of the Scotch marine boiler type and was the first instance of that type of boiler on a Revenue Cutter Service vessel.Evans, p 98 The addition of steam jackets on the cylinders to reduce condensation losses was another innovation new to the service. Her cost and displacement were somewhat greater than the Dexter-class (1874) cutters of similar length and overall design.Compare US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (b). The Dexter class consisted of Dexter, Rush, and Dallas. Construction of the Corwin was contracted in May 1875 with completion scheduled for February 28, 1876. Captain John W. White was construction superintendent for the Revenue Cutter Service. The Corwin was the first government vessel constructed in the state of Oregon, and a large crowd came out to see her launched August 23, 1876. Oregon Iron Works became insolvent that fall and was declared bankrupt; this resulted in liens filed against the vessel by suppliers and subcontractors for unpaid bills. On January 2, 1877, Judge J. Deady of the U.S District Court, Oregon District ruled that the lien of libellants Coffin and Hendry was valid, that the government was not yet the owner of the vessel and had not been in possession when the vessel was seized by the marshal on November 29. However, the Corwin had been extricated about January 1, 1877 by Captain White and the USRC Rush and moved to the middle of the Columbia River (another source has this about January 10). The Government appealed Judge Deady's ruling and Coffin and Hendry withdrew their claim on the basis of assurances that they would be paid faster if they settled. After a flurry of unsuccessful legal actions by other claimants, the Corwin was removed to San Francisco where she was completed at a cost of $10150.77 and subsequently commissioned. Congress was still considering suppliers and workmen's claims in 1884.50th Congress 1st Session House Report 45648th Congress 1st session Senate Reports 572, 573KimballThe revenue cutterNew York Times Jan 22, 1877 The Corwin was reported to be capable of 12 knots under sail (48-hour average with a beam wind), 11.5 knots under steam alone, and 13‚Äì14 knots under combined power.New York Times January 17, 1892, June 16, 1891 In 1900, her speed (probably cruising speed) was reported as 9 knots.Vanderlip Details of the Corwin's original three-gun armament are not available.US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a) In 1891 she reportedly carried four three-inch breech- loading rifles and two Gatling guns. In July 1891, the New York Times reported that she would be rearmed with six-pounder Hotchkiss rapid-fire guns.New York Times June 16, 1891, July 3, 1891 Federal career Corwin caught and lifted by ice floes, Bering Sea, 1880 Corwin entering a lead 1884 The Corwin spent her entire career in the Pacific and Arctic oceans; her home port throughout her government service was San Francisco. She made her first trip to northern waters in 1877 under Captain J.W. White.US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a) In 1880 and 1881 with Calvin L. Hooper commanding and Michael Healy as Executive Officer, she searched in the Arctic for the USS Jeannette, a lost exploration vessel, and two lost whalers, Vigilant and Mount Wollaston.Evans, p 115 For this expedition, she was sheathed with one-inch oak planks from two feet above the water line to six feet below, with the oak applied over the copper and secured with 2.5-inch composition nails. Also added was an ice- breaking attachment for her bow, constructed of 3/8 inch iron plate, which could be put in place when needed.Hooper Captain Hooper sent out exploratory parties by dogsled along the Siberian arctic coast. Artifacts and stories collected from the Chukchi residents of the coast confirmed that the Vigilant had been lost with no survivors, and apparently had picked up survivors from the Mount Wollaston before her own disaster.New York Times Nov 7, 1881 In the course of the Corwin's 1880 cruise, Captain Hooper located and mapped coal deposits in cliffs east of Cape Lisburne, Alaska, previously discovered by Captain E.E. Smith, the Corwin's ice pilot. The crew mined coal from these deposits in both 1880 and 1881, and the site has since been known as the Corwin coal mine. On a visit to various Alaskan islands, they confirmed the St. Lawrence Island famine which killed over 1000 people. In 1881 the Corwin carried a scientific detachment including John Muir, Irving C. Rosse, M.D., and Edward W. Nelson, and in the course of the search for the Jeannette landed parties on Herald and Wrangel Islands in the Chukchi Sea.Evans, pp 118-119 In 1882, with Michael Healy as captain, the Corwin was dispatched to St Lawrence Bay to pick up the stranded crew of the , another ship of the Jeannette search which burned while overwintering in Siberia. The Rodgers crew was picked up by the whaler North Star and later transferred to the Corwin which returned them to San Francisco.New York Times April 30, 1882, June 22, 1882 June 24, 1882 In October 1882 she participated in the Angoon Bombardment which was the shelling and burning of the Tlingit village Angoon in retaliation for a hostage-taking incident. A contemporary letter discovered about 1990 partly confirms and partly refutes the official Navy account of this incident.US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a)Naval Historical CenterKing, pp 39-40Strobridge & Noble, p 46Gagne-Hawes Her voyages in 1884 and 1885 included explorations by boat detachments of the Kobuk (1884 and 1885; Healy wrote Kowak) and Noatak (1885) rivers in Alaska and the first ascent and investigation of the newly formed Bogoslof volcano in the Aleutians.Healy, M.A. 1887, 1889Evans, p 124 The Corwin was replaced on the Arctic patrol by the USRC Bear starting in 1886.Evans, p 129 Among the reasons for this change was the Corwin's limited coal capacity which interfered with long cruises.King, p 82 The Corwin returned to the Bering Sea in 1886 and from 1890 to 1897 to combat fur seal poaching.United States Coast Guard (1935) In December 1893 she carried dispatches to US ambassador Albert S. Willis in Hawaii at the height of the political crisis following the deposition of Queen Liliuokalani. Corwin's arrival there caused some consternation since it was thought it might signal US intervention to restore the queen.New York Times December 6, 1893 (a,b), January 20, 1894; technically, Willis's title was Minister; ambassador (un- capitalized) is here used descriptively. The Corwin went into the dockyard at Quartermaster Harbor, Washington for extensive repairs including refastening and some engine work before the 1896 season.Tacoma Public Library (b)New York Times Dec 14, 1895 She operated under Navy orders with a Revenue Service crew during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, serving around San Diego, and was returned to the United States Treasury Department in August 1898.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships She was back in service in Alaska in 1899New York Times October 17, 1899 The Corwin was decommissioned and sold February 14, 1900 for 16,500 and was replaced on the Bering Sea patrol by the USRC Manning.Record of Movements, p 196 Corwin remained active in the Bering Sea as a merchant and charter vessel after she was sold.US Coast Guard, Historian's Office (a); West. McCurdy's has the sale in 1899, for 17,025, to J.E Ryus (Tacoma Public Library (c)); Victoria Daily Colonist Feb 15, 1900 says Ryus did not fulfill offer; ship sold to Tacoma Fish Company for 16,000 Wrangel Island as seen from the top of Herald Island by a member of the Corwin party, 1881 Merchant career =Minerals exploration= In 1900 Ellsworth Luce West, a whaling captain from Martha's Vineyard, and some Boston investors formed a company to develop the coal deposits near Cape Lisburne to supply the Nome market. Needing a suitable ship, they entered the winning bid for the Corwin and organized as the Corwin Trading Company. The project increased in scope when one investor (veteran prospector, engineer, and writer A.G. Kingsbury) pledged Nome gold claims for his shares. Although Kingsbury described them as \\"conservative Boston capitalists\\" the investors appear to have been as much enthusiasts as any Nome prospectors; all insisted on joining the expedition.WestKingsbury 1900 To create cargo space in the Corwin, West had the entire wardroom torn out. The lost accommodations were replaced with a cabin constructed from the stern to the engine room, creating a raised poop deck.West This modification is shown clearly in a 1902 photograph.Curtis; a photo in Kingsbury (1900) shows the Corwin in the dockyard with the cabin partly built West describes the Corwin as brig-rigged in this period, but photos from 1900 continue to show a gaff on the foremast and no yards crossed on the mainmast, so this is more a difference of terminology than a change of sail-plan.WestA brigantine is also known as a hermaphrodite brig in US usage, and the only difference between a brigantine and a topsail schooner is the presence of a fore-and-aft foresail in the latter. In the 1902 Curtis photo the foresail gaff is gone but there are still no yards on the mainmast. There is no foresail boom in any photo, even from her revenue cutter days. Vanderlip implausibly calls her a barkentine. West reports using sails at various times in 1900 and 1902. Captain West could not obtain a passenger license for the ship without having her re-caulked, so the small number of passengers were signed as crew members. She went up to Nome carrying expedition equipment and general cargo and from about June 3‚Äì10 was occupied with the rescue and salvage of the barkentine Catherine Sudden, which had suffered a punctured hull and two broken masts hitting ice.WestStandard Marine...The Catherine Sudden A little later she set out on a prospecting expedition to Cape Chaplino and stopped at St Lawrence Island about June 17. There she encountered the Russian steamer Progress, chartered by American mining engineer Washington Vanderlip and his Russian backers. Vanderlip hired the Corwin to clear a channel through the ice so Progress could reach Cape Chaplino and the clear water just off the Siberian coast. Vanderlip described the Corwin's action as an icebreaker: \\"Some of the ice the Corwin can push to one side or the other but when this is not possible she backs up in order to get good headway and charges the obstruction and strikes it fairly between the eyes. She comes to a dead stop and quivers from stem to stern with the tremendous impact A rending grinding noise is heard and the berg which challenged us is a berg no longer...\\" Vanderlip p. 305 Finding the streams near Cape Chaplino still ice- clogged, the Corwin returned to Nome. In mid-July she headed north on a minerals exploration trip. She reached the coal deposits after prospecting stops at Grantley Harbor (adjacent to Port Clarence, Alaska) and along the coast. The largest seam had already been staked by a competing company (that party traveled by land), but the Corwin's party staked several other claims, mined and loaded coal, and returned to Nome with 100 tons (four lighter-loads) to sell. Coal was handled in sacks of 200 lb, lowered down the cliffs by rope. It reportedly sold tor $18‚Äì20 per ton at Nome.National Geographic A second trip developed the mines and brought out 25 tons.WestPackard In April 1901 the Corwin was towed from Port Townsend to Esquimalt and hauled out for refitting. She then spent most of that summer tied to the dock for nonpayment of the dockyard bill. Captain West, who had spent the early part of the season as second mate on an east coast collier, was eventually sent west with $2000 to settle up. After paying the bills, he set about finding work for the vessel to pay her keep. A plan to charter her out for halibut fishing was vetoed by F.W. Huestis, president of the Corwin Trading Company, reportedly because of insurance costs.Victoria Daily Colonist April 25, 1901; West. This paragraph follows West in having her towed from Port Townsend (rather than coming up from Seattle under her own power), but follows the Colonist for the date.Victoria Daily Colonist November 26, 1901 =Passenger and freight service= Corwin unloading on sea ice at Nome, June 1, 1907; F.H.

Accommodations were rearranged to carry 35 first-class and 50 steerage passengers. She departed Seattle in May and spent the summer and early fall serving Nome and surrounding towns and camps as far north as Deering on Kotzebue Sound.WestMorning Leader Nov 29, 1902; Nov 1, 1903Nowell 1902 She underwent further modification at Moran's yard in Seattle before the 1904 season. This work extended or replaced the stern cabin to give her an entire second deck as well as a vertical stem (fitted with a steel ice protector),West; the first ice protector was made in two pieces held by bolts, not the single wrap-around piece West specified. It tore loose as soon as it hit ice.

The changes added six first-class staterooms and more steerage space, bringing her capacity to 100 passengers and about 200 tons freight.West One source reports the cost of the rebuilding as $40000.Kimball; it is not clear from the context whether this is the 1904 refit or the total cost of work from 1900 on. According to West, the 1904 work was initially estimated at $20000 but there were overruns. When she headed out for Alaska in May 1904 after addition of the second deck there were rumors the modification had made her topheavy.West Some passengers complained before departure that she was overloaded and unseaworthy. Inspectors ordered that all freight be stowed below deck, but permitted her to sail. Subsequently, there were reports that wreckage from the ship had been found on Vancouver Island leading to fears she was lost, but she reached Nome safely on June 8.WestVictoria Daily Colonist May 20, 1904New York Times May 24, 1904Victoria Daily Colonist, June 25, 1904 The Victoria Daily Colonist could not find the origin of the reports and branded them a deliberate hoax.Victoria Daily Colonist, May 24, 1904 p3, May 26, 1904, p8 The Corwin continued in the passenger and freight businessHarrison p 374New York Times May 31, 1914 and from 1906 to 1910 held a contract to transport mail to towns on Norton Sound and the Seward Peninsula. She was the first ship to reach Nome in the spring in 1902‚Äì1909, 1913 and 1914. She generally returned to Puget Sound in the fall and was often the last ship out of Nome.West; Corwin had carried mail from Seattle to Nome in earlier years at no charge to the government.New York Times August 15, 1909Tacoma Public Library (d)Morning Leader Nov 29, 1902 In part, her early arrivals were due to the fact that she was sheathedKimball (1912) describes the sheathing as ironwood. Vanderlip describes her sheathing in 1900 as \\"greenheart timber\\", possibly Chlorocardium rodiei. The original oak could have been replaced in the 1896 refit or possibly earlier. Victoria Daily Colonist, May 9, 1901 reports the Corwin was stripped, caulked, sheathed, and copper painted at Bullen's yard, though West, p 90, is unaware she had been recaulked. and retained a protected and reinforced bow for ice work. In 1908, after arriving at Nome during a particularly bad ice season, the Corwin headed out again and cut channels to free three steamers that were stuck in the ice 50 miles from Nome, one (the Victoria) in danger of sinking and all in danger of being carried north by moving ice.West, Victoria Daily Colonist June 19, 1908; see also Kimball On June 11, 1909, Corwin received a distress call from St. Croix a vessel trapped in the ice and taking on water South of Nome. Corwin refused to come to the aid of St. Croix for no less than $6,000. In 1914, it was arranged that she would lead the waiting fleet of steamers into Nome, following closely as the Revenue Cutter Bear picked out a channel through the ice. For most of her merchant career, she was owned by the Pacific Coal and Transportation Company (successor to the Corwin Trading Company), and her official home port was listed as Boston. Captain West returned as Master from 1902 to 1910; his wife Gertrude sailed with him as Ship's Clerk. Most of the crew were Eskimo (they were less likely to desert the ship to go prospecting), and the kitchen staff were Chinese. The Corwin held daily fire drills, and was equipped with wireless since the 1904 refit.WestStearnsBureau of Navigation 1901, 1903, 1904, 1909KeelerSan Francisco Chronicle In 1911 and 1912, the Corwin was listed as a ship of the Western Alaska Steamship Company.Commissioner of Navigation In 1913, her home port was listed as Seattle and her owner as Ben Moyses.Bureau of Navigation 1913 Part 6 =Attempted Karluk rescue= In 1914, a wealthy Nome mine-owner and businessman, Jafet Lindeberg, chartered the Corwin (Captain R.J. Healy) from the Kotzebue Transportation and Trading Company to attempt a rescue the Karluk survivors from Wrangel Island. She reached Wrangel Island one day after the survivors had been rescued by Olaf Swenson and his crew in the King & Winge. She then proceeded to look for four missing members of Karluk's crew, circling Herald Island without seeing any sign of the missing men. The Corwin struck a reef off Cape Douglas on her return trip and went hard aground. She was refloated by jettisoning and lightering supplies to lighten ship, with assistance from the USRC Bear and a crew from the Nome Lifesaving station.BartlettNew York Times September 22, 1914StefanssonCochran pp82-83Healy, R.J 1915Lewis, Anderson... =Ultimate fate= By 1916, the Corwin was majority-owned by Schubach & Hamilton, who sold her to Mexican owners. She burned in drydock at Salina Cruz that same year.Tacoma Public Library (e) Legacy Several places in Alaska and Yukon are named for the Corwin, including Corwin Bluff (the bluff near Cape Lisburne containing the Corwin Coal Mine), Corwin Rock in the Aleutian Islands, and possibly Cape Corwin on Nunivak Island. Kivalina lagoon was called Corwin Lagoon by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1884 to about 1950.

Five thousand members of the White League, a paramilitary terrorist organization made up largely of Confederate veterans, fought against the outnumbered New Orleans Metropolitan Police and state militia. The insurgents held the statehouse, armory, and downtown for three days, retreating before arrival of Federal troops that restored the elected government. No insurgents were charged in the action. This was the last major event of violence stemming from the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election, after which Democrat John McEnery and Republican William Pitt Kellogg both claimed victory. Among those injured in the fighting at Liberty Place was Algernon Sidney Badger, superintendent of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police. Born in Boston and a veteran of the Union Army, he had been living and working in New Orleans since the end of the war. Background The \\"Battle of Liberty Place\\" was the name given to the insurrection by its Democratic supporters, as part of their story of the struggle to overturn Republicans and the Reconstruction government. Although this government brought about greater equality and opportunity for blacks, white supremacists saw it as tyranny. In the election of 1872, John McEnery, a Democrat, was supported by a coalition of Democrats and anti-Grant Republicans, including Republican Gov. Henry C. Warmoth. Warmoth's opponents in the Republican Party remained loyal to President Grant, and supported the Republican Party nominee, William Pitt Kellogg. Governor Warmoth had appointed the State Returning Board, which administered elections; it declared McEnery the winner. A rival board endorsed Kellogg, who had charged election fraud because of the violence and intimidation that took place at and near the polls, as Democrats tried to suppress black voting. The legislature impeached Warmoth from office and removed him for \\"stealing\\" the election. Lieutenant Governor P. B. S. Pinchback became governor for the last 35 days of Warmoth's term. Both McEnery and Kellogg had inaugural parties and certified lists of appointed local officeholders. The federal government eventually certified Kellogg as the governor of the state. Similarly, Republican C. C. Antoine was certified lieutenant-governor over Democrat Davidson Bradfute Penn. In an earlier violent incident related to the disputed election, in April 1873 the Colfax massacre occurred at the courthouse in Grant Parish, when a white militia attacked freedmen defending appointed Republican officeholders. This action was also related to political tensions between whites and blacks. In Colfax, three whites and a total of 150 blacks were killed, at least 50 of the latter after having been taken prisoner. James Longstreet after the Civil War In 1874 McEnery and his allies formed a \\"rump\\" legislature in New Orleans, then the location of state government. The paramilitary White League entered the city with a force of 5,000 to seat McEnery; they fought against 3,500 police and state militia for control. The White League defeated the state militia, inflicting about 100 casualties. The insurgents occupied the state house and armory for three days, and turned out Governor Kellogg. When former Confederate general James Longstreet tried to stop the fighting, he was pulled from his horse, shot by a spent bullet, and taken prisoner by the White League. Kellogg wired for federal troops and, within three days, President Ulysses S. Grant sent Federal troops there. The White League insurgents retreated from New Orleans before the federal troops arrived, and no one was prosecuted. Battle In response to a call for a mass meeting to protest against the seizure of arms of private citizens, men gathered on Canal Street around 10:00 Monday morning and a committee consisting of Robert H. Marr (chairman), Jules Tuyes, Samuel Dopin, Samuel Bell, and J. M. Seixas called upon the governor, meeting BG Henry Dibble at the executive office at noon. The governor refused to meet and considered the committee as representing now armed masses a menace. Marr declared that the masses were unarmed, but Dibble countered that while those on Canal Street may be unarmed, beyond there were armed bodies assembled for the same purpose.The White Leaguers Make a Demonstration in New Orleans. Cincinnati Daily Gazette (Cincinnati, Ohio), Tuesday, September 15, 1874, Page: 1 Battle at the Customs House Bronze of F. N. Ogden About 4:00 in the afternoon, self-proclaimed Lieutenant Governor D. B. Penn made a proclamation calling on the militia of the state to assemble \\"for the purpose of driving the usurpers from power\\". Frederick Nash Ogden was appointed provisional general of the \\"Louisiana State Militia\\" (here representing the White League) by Penn and a statement was made to blacks in Louisiana that their rights and property should not be harmed. Already by 3 PM armed men were stationed at the intersection of all streets on the south side of Canal Street, from the river to Clayborne street. At 4 PM, a body of Metropolitan Police with cavalry and artillery, commanded by Longstreet, arrived at Canal Street and ordered the armed citizens to disperse. Once firing began, however, the police broke and the White League captured one piece of artillery. The White League then captured City Hall and the fire alarm telegraph and built a barricade along Poydras Street and from that street to the canal. A company of Federal Troops protected the custom house but was not involved in the initial conflict, while the White League held the portion of the city above the canal and massed around Jackson Square and the St. Louis Hotel. Most of the barricades were made with street railroad cars. Among the police killed were Sergeant James McManus, Sergeant J. K. Champaign, Corporal J. F. Clermont, Officers J. Hill, E Simmonds, J. Schields, and H. Ballard. Among the White Leaguers killed were E. A. Toledano, Frederick Moreman, Dick Lindsey, Captain J. M. West, Major J. K Gourdain, and journalist J. M. Cleet. Badger's leg was crushed when his horse was killed under him and he had his leg amputated.Anarchy At The South. Result of Last Night's Fighting at New Orleans.

By the 17th, federal forces were arriving and the situation had reversed, and General William H. Emory met with opposition leaders McEnery, Penn, Marr, and Duncan F. Cage, guaranteeing the freedom from arrest of those involved in exchange for the restoration of the state administration, the return of arms from the state arsenal, and the resumption of the status before the outbreak of violence. The group submitted, insisting no show of force was necessary, but that they regarded Louisiana as no longer a state, but as a province without a democratic government. Later that day a rumor spread that a group of as many as 2000 blacks intended to capture Treme station, but the disturbance was quelled. The 22nd US Infantry was ordered to proceed to New Orleans under General Irvin McDowell; the frigate Colorado and the gunboats Kansas and Shawmut were sent from their station in Key West under Admiral James Robert Madison Mullany. By September 21, the surrender was complete and the temporary police force in the city was replaced by the regular forces.Louisiana the Conference between the Republican and Democratic Leaders Comes to Naughy, Daily Inter Ocean (Chicago, Illinois), Tuesday, September 22, 1874 Volume: III Issue: 181 Page: 1 Results Grant ordered General Philippe R√©gis de Trobriand, commanding the 13th Regiment, to the city to protect the state government from violence. On January 4, 1875, Governor Kellogg requested his aid to eject men from the legislature who had not been certified by the Returning Board. Trobriand entered the state house with some men at the governor's request, and escorted the eight men out after they had each given speeches of objection. The Democrats never returned; they set up an alternate legislature meeting at the Odd Fellows Hall in the city. They were committed to their candidate, Francis T. Nicholls, as governor for the next two years. During the remaining period, the Republican gubernatorial claimant, Stephen B. Packard, and legislators effectively controlled only a small part of New Orleans. White Democrats outside the city supported Nicholls. Trobriand and his regiment stayed in the city until January 1877, when federal troops were withdrawn in the 1877 compromise. Battle of Liberty Place Monument The monument in its original location on Canal Street, 1906 In 1891, the city erected the Battle of Liberty Place Monument to commemorate and praise the insurrection from the Democratic Party point of view, which at the time was in firm political control of the city and state and was in the process of disenfranchising most blacks. The white marble obelisk was placed at a prominent location on Canal Street. In 1932, the city added an inscription that expressed a white supremacist view. In 1974, the rethinking of race relations after the Civil Rights Movement caused the city to add a marker near the monument explaining that the inscription did not express current philosophy. After major construction work on Canal Street in 1989 required that the monument be temporarily removed, it was relocated to a less prominent location and the inscription was altered to say \\"in honor of those Americans on both sides of the conflict.\\" In July 2015, New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu proposed removing the monument altogetherhttp://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/06/lee_circle_statue_new_orleans.html and in December 2015 the New Orleans City Council voted to remove the monument, along with three others deemed a \\"nuisance\\" (statues of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard and Confederate States President Jefferson Davis). The monument was removed on April 24, 2017 by workers with a police escort, due to threats made by supporters of the monument.Washington Post  See also  *Insurrection Act of 1807 *Brooks‚ÄìBaxter War *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References External links * Battle of Liberty Place Monument, Historic Marker Database * Account of 2004 vandalism to monument, New Orleans Indymedia, June 2004 Category:1874 in American politics Category:1874 in Louisiana Liberty Place Category:Crimes in New Orleans Category:Rebellions in the United States Category:Riots and civil disorder in Louisiana Category:Riots and civil disorder during the Reconstruction Era Category:White American riots in the United States Category:September 1874 events Category:White League Category:James Longstreet Category:19th century in New Orleans Category:History of racism in Louisiana ","title":"Battle of Liberty Place"},{"id":"23176415","text":"This is a list of Brazilian schools in Japan.

Graham McMillan represented Australia at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Graham McMillan scored Australia's first goal in its 1956 Olympic campaign. Graham McMillan was awarded the \\"Award of Distinction\\" when he was inducted in 1999 into the Football Hall of Fame (Australia) which is organised by Football Federation Australia. Early years Graham McMillan was the second son of Alexander and Evelyn McMillan. His father was born in Glasgow, Scotland and came to Australia in 1913. His father was a talented football (soccer) player and represented the State of Queensland in the 1920s. His mother was a good sprinter and was a member of the local \\"Mayne Harriers Athletics Club\\". Graham McMillan had a sister, Patricia, who died at the age of 3 prior to his birth, and an older brother, Alexander (who went by the name \\"Lex\\"). Graham McMillan's early education was at the local Junction Park State Primary School in Annerley, where he represented in inter-school competition at both football (soccer) and Cricket. Graham McMillan attended Industrial High in his secondary years, which fielded a football (soccer) team in the local club competition. As a Sub-Junior Graham McMillan was selected in the football (soccer) Senior School team and also represented the school at Cricket in the 1st Eleven team. Formative years Graham McMillan's father fostered both his brothers' and his interest and love for both football (soccer) and Cricket by taking them regularly to both club and interstate events. On the football (soccer) side of things, as mentioned, his father had been an accomplished player and was considered a master of the dribble. Graham McMillan's father taught his brother and him the art of keeping the ball from opponents. The family would also practice heading with a tennis ball to learn perfect timing which allowed them to send the ball a great distance. Graham McMillan honed his heading and timing skills by using a tennis ball tied to a clothes line. Lowering the line also helped time his feet volleying skills of a moving ball. Graham McMillan's practice paid off as he is readily remembered for his hang time and ability to out-leap much taller opponents, despite his relatively small stature. Football career At the age of 17 Graham McMillan teamed up with his brother Lex and they played for YMCA in the \\"A\\" Division, the top division in the Brisbane / Ipswich football (soccer) competition. Whilst still a teenager Graham McMillan represented Brisbane against Ipswich in an annual competition for the Kruger Cup, an event played in a home and away format and which was always a hard-fought encounter. The Ipswich players were mostly hardened coal miners and played a tough, physical game. These matches were a great education and friendships Graham McMillan gained with some of the Ipswich players endure to this very day. In 1955 Graham McMillan was selected as a standby player for the Queensland State Team and secured his place in the 1956 Queensland team the following year. In the 1956 selection match of Probables versus Possibles, Graham McMillan scored a record eight (8) individual goals in the eleven (11) to three (3) victory by the Probables. From ensuing matches against the State sides of New South Wales and Victoria, Graham McMillan was selected in a combination \\"Eastern States Team\\" to play against the other States ‚Äì South Australia in Adelaide, Western Australia in Perth and Tasmania in Hobart. Prior to the Western Australia match their local newspaper stated that Graham McMillan was rated as the best inside forward found in Australia for many years. Thankfully he had a good game, with the Perth press stating, \\"Grahame McMillan received applause for this fine approach work, and local critics unanimously claimed him as the best man on the field.\\" The matches against the other States on that trip were just as successful for Graham McMillan and in October 1956, he was advised that he had been selected to represent Australia at the 1956 Summer Olympics. In 1957, a Hungarian side, Ferencv√°rosi Torna Club, visited with coach Professor √Årp√°d Csan√°di, who was also mentor of the Hungarian National Team. Professor Csan√°di was most impressed by Graham McMillan's performance and proclaimed McMillan as the best player he had seen in Australia. The report of the match when they played Queensland stated that Graham McMillan's pace and clever ball control caused the Hungarians to make substitutions to strengthen their defence. Professor Csan√°di told Graham McMillan that he would like to take him to play in Europe. Graham McMillan considered the request but felt it was not a suitable move at the time with Hungary recovering from political unrest. Nevertheless, Professor Csan√°di said he would recommend McMillan to any team over there. The upshot was that Graham McMillan received an invitation from London Club Leyton Orient to go over and join them. Graham McMillan arrived in London on 17 October 1957. The club set him up in ‚Äòdigs‚Äô not far from the Orient‚Äôs ground, which was located, ironically, in Brisbane Road. In those days the remuneration was not great and players at the end of their careers were shown the door and had to seek other employment. This situation was brought home to McMillan one Sunday when he was at the ground having a bit of a kick around. McMillan got chatting to a bloke who was sweeping out the stands and it turned out he had been a player of some note and had been captain of the team. When he retired the Club had kept him on as a cleaner. Graham McMillan injured his left knee in the New Year. The treatment afforded to him by the Club was a bit of a rub and a reassuring, \\"you‚Äôre ok\\" by an unqualified ‚Äòtrainer‚Äô in the Club‚Äôs Medical Room in which the facilities were way short of state-of-the-art. McMillan kept playing though the knee failed to respond to ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô. In the end McMillan decided that he had had enough, the knee was not improving. The Club asked him to reconsider, but with no offer of treatment by a qualified expert he could not see any chance of improvement in his condition. A further offer to reconsider came from Eddie Baily, a former Nottingham Forest and England international footballer who was transferring back to Leyton Orient. Eddie and McMillan would have a ‚Äòcuppa‚Äô at the Tea Shop in the High Street after training. But McMillan's mind was made up and he flew back to Brisbane in 1958. Despite his injured knee, Graham McMillan continued to be selected for both State and Australian soccer teams. In 1959, Graham McMillan and his brother Lex joined a new football club, Annerley. This club had just been promoted to the 1st Division and consisted of a number of young players having their first experience at that level. A very good friend of Graham McMillan's, Bill Barron, who had worked with McMillan as a trainer for many years joined Annerley as coach. Barron boasted very little soccer experience but was a great thinker and innovator and the club, to its credit, was prepared to give him a go. They were not disappointed. The team won every trophy on offer that year. The Minor Premiership, the Grand Final, the Hilton Shield and the Tristram Shield, in which Annerley F.C. won the final by nine (9) goals to nil. The newspaper report stated that, \\"the team gave the finest display ever seen by a Brisbane Club team. Their controlled passing, interchanging, pace and machine-like play ripped the oppositions defence to ribbons\\". Graham McMillan and his brother Lex spent one more year with Annerley F.C, but with the emergence of the ethnic clubs in Brisbane, Lex was signed by Polonia whilst Graham McMillan was signed by Hellenic F.C. In Graham McMillan's first year with Hellenic F.C. he finally had his knee operated on. After a short rehabilitation period McMillan was back playing, ending the season with Hellenic as champions. Graham McMillan played 9 seasons with Hellenic F.C. during which time the team won 5 Premierships plus many other trophies. Graham McMillan retired in 1970 after a 1st Division career spanning 23 years. Graham McMillan represented the State of Queensland from 1956 to 1968, captaining the team in the latter years. Graham McMillan represented Australia on several occasions in the mid to late 1950s. Miscellaneous Graham McMillan was invited and took part in the Torch Relay for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Personal life Graham McMillan married Mary Jones, in Brisbane in 1959. They have three (3) children, Lissa McMillan, Lexia Willmington and Martin McMillan and five grandchildren (Elysha Willmington, Kelsey Willmington, Annika McMillan, Isaac Willmington and Connor McMillan).

He is co-author with Marjorie Mikasen of the nonfiction book ReAction! Chemistry in the Movies. Biochemist Griep studies the proteins that synthesize DNA, namely primase and DnaB helicase. Of these, most of his work concerns primase, the enzyme that initiates DNA synthesis during DNA replication. His goal is to discover the next generation of antibiotics by searching for inhibitors of bacterial primase. To help him do this, he seeks to understand the structure and function of primase from many bacteria. For his science outreach efforts, he studies the chemistry found in feature films and then communicates his findings to the other chemists and the public. In recognition of this work, he was awarded a Distinguished Teaching Award from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Author Griep is the coauthor with artist Marjorie Mikasen of the nonfiction book ReAction! Chemistry in the Movies (2009 Oxford University Press).

Written by David Boothroyd, it was published in 2001 by Politico's Publishing Ltd and distributed in the United States by International Specialized Book Services (ISBS). At the time of the book's publication, Boothroyd worked as a researcher with Parliamentary Monitoring Services. The book contains entries on over 250 UK political parties that have participated in parliamentary elections. It is structured alphabetically by entry, with the size of each entry relative to the history and influence of the individual political party. Boothroyd includes information about the history and election statistics of each party, as well as a brief narrative. He focuses on the Conservative, Liberal, and Labour parties; the parties with the most significant histories in British politics. Boothroyd's work received positive reviews in book journals. The book was recommended by The School Librarian and Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries; although the latter criticised it for not including bibliographical aids. The authors of the bibliographical work Information Sources of Political Science described it as a \\"handy guide\\", and it was used as a reference in Third Force Politics: Liberal Democrats at the Grassroots. Contents The History of British Political Parties is a comprehensive work which lists and describes over 250 political parties in the United Kingdom that have participated in parliamentary elections since 1832. Entries are organised alphabetically, and most descriptions of the political parties span a few paragraphs or pages. Space is allotted to each entry based on the individual party's history and influence; 34 pages are devoted to the Conservative Party, whereas only two paragraphs are given to the Captain Beany's New Millennium Bean Party. Each entry contains objective information on the party including its history, address, the number of registered members, election statistics, and their email address and website if these exist. The author provides a detailed, narrative description of each party. Boothroyd writes, \\"Only three parties out of the 250 ... have ever formed a government in the United Kingdom.\\" He devotes the most discussion in the book to the Conservative, Liberal and Labour parties. The book includes cross-references to enable the reader to easily locate political parties that have had changes over time. Reception In a review of the book for The School Librarian, Valerie Caless wrote, \\"Overall, this is a thorough historical guide to the political parties, and will serve as a very useful reference book for students of both history and politics at all levels. A glossary or 'concepts' guide would have been a bonus for the new or less patient student.\\" N.W. Polsby of the University of California, Berkeley reviewed the book for Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, and wrote, \\"The total absence of bibliographical aids is a weakness of this book. Its strengths are its plainly factual and accessible writing. This is a book to be consulted, not read straight through. Recommended at all levels.\\" A review in Reference & Research Book News said, \\"The book is intended as an affordable reference book for the general reader interested in British politics\\". The History of British Political Parties was also reviewed in Parliamentary Affairs. In the 2003 book The Times House of Commons Guide: 1929, 1931, 1935, Boothroyd is mentioned as the author of The History of British Political Parties and referred to as \\"an elections specialist\\". In the 2005 bibliographical work Information Sources of Political Science, authors Stephen W. Green, Douglas Ernest, and Frederick L. Holler described Boothroyd's book as \\"a handy guide to approximately 250 British political parties,\\" and wrote, \\"Even some of the more humorous and tongue-in- cheek political parties are included in this handbook, such as the Official Monster Raving Loony Party\\". The book is used as a reference in the works Third Force Politics: Liberal Democrats at the Grassroots (2006) by Paul Whiteley, Patrick Seyd and Antony Billinghurst, published by Oxford University Press; The Logic of Pre-Electoral Coalition Formation (2006) by Sona Nadenichek Golder, published by Ohio State University Press; and in Posters, Propaganda, and Persuasion in Election Campaigns Around the World and Through History (2008) by Steven A.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 896. Tim Golden, of the New York Times, interviewed Parkhudin when he broke the story of how Habibullah and Dilawar died under torture at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in 2005. Abduction In 2002, Parkhudin, a 26-year-old farmer, was a passenger in Dilawar's jitney taxi along with two other men, Abdur Rahim, and Zakim Shah. All four men were taken captive by Jan Baz Khan, an Afghan militia leader who had a contract to provide security for Forward Operating Base Salerno. Jan Baz Khan told his American contacts that the four men were responsible for firing missiles at the base and he handed them over to the Americans in early December 2002. The men spent their first days in captivity with their hands shackled to the ceiling, suspended in a \\"stress position\\". Their heads were covered by a hood, and they were often beaten. Less than a week after their arrival, the taxi driver, Dilawar, died under this torture. Parkhudin, Abdur Rahim and Zakim Shah survived. Parkhudin was transferred to Guantanamo on 7 February 2003. Release Golden reported that by January 2003, less than two months after coming into American captivity, American intelligence analysts concluded that Dilawar and his three passengers were in fact innocent victims of Jan Baz Khan and that the militia fired the missiles themselves. However, it was not until March 2004 that Parkhudin and the others were finally released. Golden reported that, upon their return to Afghanistan, the three men were unable to tell Dilawar's family of how much he had suffered in US captivity.

Pre-human forest cover Since New Zealand was the last major landmass to be settled by humans, anthropological changes are easier to study than in countries with a longer human history. A picture of the vegetation cover has been built up through the use of archeological and fossil remains, especially pollen grains from old forests. Intact forests are found on Stewart Island and Ulva Island, but during the Pleistocene these areas would have been covered in grass and shrubland. During the last glacial maximum podocarp, broadleaf and beech forest grew in the far north of New Zealand. MƒÅori settlement Prior to MƒÅori arrival, New Zealand was almost entirely forested, besides high alpine regions and those areas affected by volcanic activity. MƒÅori began settling the country about 1000 years ago and by 1840, when Europeans were a small part of the total population, the forest cover is said to have been significantly reduced from 85% down to 53%. European settlement A photo from the Auckland Weekly News (9 March 1911) shows smoke billowing above the horizon, with the caption \\"The epidemic of bush fires in Auckland Province\\". When the first Europeans arrived, in 1769, there was still thick, dense forest cover. Early explorers such as Cook and Banks described the land as \\"immense woods, lofty trees and the finest timber\\".Wynn, G. ‚ÄòDestruction under the guise of improvement: The forest, 1840-1920‚Äô, in Pawson and Brooking, (eds), Environmental History of New Zealand, (2002), 100-118. Timber was mainly used for repairs to sailing ships until the 19th century. With the colony of New South Wales rapidly expanding, the need for timber from New Zealand began to rise. Timber exports, mainly kauri, became a major industry for New Zealand. There are records from the 1840s stating that 50 to 100 ships could be tied to shore in Kaipara Harbour and be filled with lumber from giant floating booms that could hold 10,000 logs at a time. Besides as a form of lumber, many pioneers found the kauri trees valuable for the gum they produced to make varnish and linoleum, primarily in the north island near Auckland. The colonists used unconventional methods to gather this gum from living trees. Stripping these trees and the ground around them resulted in the destruction of the land, rendering it unusable for agriculture (Wynn pg. 108). Without the trees to hold the soil and debris to the land, water flowed freely, causing frequent and regular flooding. As most of New Zealand was covered with thick bush, the slash-and-burn technique was often used to prepare land wanted for farming in forested areas. This practice was not carried out very responsibly due to the complexity of controlling a fire, and unintentionally resulted in large areas of land catching fire. Thousands of acres were accidentally burned and destroyed. After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, settlers begin a rapid expansion. Deforestation continued for many uses, including clearing land for farming and gardens and wood for construction. An estimated of land was also lost due to human-caused forest fires within only a few days. Settlers were often granted land, such as the Homesteads, with a condition that they forfeited it if they didn't clear enough bush. The rising rate of deforestation can be correlated with a sudden rise in sawmill usage. There were only six sawmills in 1843, twelve in 1847, fifteen in 1855 and ninety- three in 1868, a growth of more than fifteen times in twenty-five years. Many saw-milling settlements were in turn supported by becoming railroad stops, leading to more clearance and job availability. With time, the mills also became more productive. These factors helped create an exponential rate of deforestation across the country. Although in 1885 the State Forest Department set aside forests to protect timber resources, for 100 years New Zealand farmers were paid incentives or provided with subsidies to clear land of trees or \\"improve\\" land for agriculture. Half of New Zealand is now converted to agricultural land, for example most of the river flats of the west coast are now pastures. Removing forests contributed to the extinction of endemic species. By removing New Zealand native forest, humans created a landscape with the climatic conditions to allow the short-horned grasshopper Phaulacridium marginale to expand its range across the country. Recent history By the 1970s the environmental movement started direct action to protect New Zealand's forests. Notable direct action campaigns were at Pureora Forest with Stephen King and the West Coast with the Native Forest Action Council and Native Forest Action. All native forest logging on public land ended in 2002 when the Labour-led government upheld its election promise to stop the logging. In 2005 forestry covered over , or 29% of the country, made up of of native forest and of planted forests. That Stats NZ estimate was made up of areas over with at least 10% crown cover and a potential minimum height of at maturity. Other measurements vary, so that one 2010 estimate, based on MPI figures, put native forest at (24%) and total tree cover at 30%, but another that same year said 31.40% of New Zealand was covered by forest. This does not include orchards or trees in parks. This figure has been slowly but steadily rising since 1998. By 2018 the estimated planted area had risen to . Forest protection Many legal avenues now exist to protect New Zealand's native forests. The Resource Management Act, a major Act of Parliament that was passed in 1991, affords any natural environment a level of legal protection through the resource consent process. The logging of native trees is governed by a permit system administered by the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) and must be shown to be sustainable. MPI also formulates policy on national and international illegal logging. In 2014 special legislation was passed to allow the extraction of large numbers of rimu trees which had toppled in a storm in the South Island. In early periods, rimu was the timber widely used in construction. After 1950, it was replaced with treated exotic Pinus radiata, but small amounts were milled for furniture into the 1990s.

Green and written by Dale Van Every and Lynn Starling. The story was adapted by Ethel Hill and Aben Kandel, based on the magazine story \\"Safari in Manhattan\\" by Matt Taylor. It tells the story of a health magazine secretary who is in love with her boss. Plot Carol Baldwin (Jean Arthur) and Helen Davis (Ruth Donnelly) are the owners and instructors of the Supreme Secretarial School. They are concerned about their student Maizie (Dorothea Kent), who cannot spell, take dictation or type. When the instructors ask her what she is doing at the school, she replies, \\"I'm here for the same reason that every other smart girl's here - to, uh, get a chance to meet nice men.\\" They let her go. However, an equally inept former pupil drops by with a new student and informs them that she will marry a junior vice president, and Maizie gets hired on the spot, despite Carol's hint to her new employer that she is too inexperienced. This leads Carol to wonder if these women are onto something. Mr. Gilbert (George Brent), the editor of Body and Brain magazine, phones to complain to Carol. He has fired numerous graduates of the school. She goes to his office to find out first-hand what he expects. He mistakes her for the new secretary and tells her to report to work in the morning. She is quickly smitten with him and does not correct him. Gilbert is a fitness fanatic. He has Ernest lead his staff in exercises at 11 o'clock and has them served a nutritious, if sparse, lunch. Mr. Crosby, the publisher and Gilbert's boss, is startled by and skeptical of Gilbert's methods. At the end of the day, Carol is delighted when Gilbert invites her to dinner. She orders a steak, but it tastes terrible. Gilbert informs her that it is made of vegetables and nuts. When she gets home, she complains to her roommate Helen, then enjoys a real steak. When Carol tries to improve Gilbert's latest article with some \\"cheesecake\\" photos of scantily clad women, he rejects them. He is then told by Crosby to fix Body and Brains declining circulation, but he still rejects Carol's suggestions. When he catches a cold, Carol implements her changes without permission, so Gilbert fires her. Later, Gilbert apologizes; the latest issue has sold out. He rehires her and agrees to soften his office rules. Their relationship heats up. Then his friend Bill Houston asks him for a favor. Bill's wife is returning from Europe, and he needs to get rid of his attractive blonde secretary, none other than Maizie. However, after speaking to Maizie, Gilbert declines to hire her. Then he promotes Carol to associate editor and makes Maizie her replacement, much to Carol's dismay. Soon Gilbert is out night after night with Maizie, neglecting his work, which Carol has to take on. Finally, Carol quits in disgust while Gilbert is away in Atlantic City with Maizie. Gilbert finally realizes he is in love with Carol. When Maizie refuses to leave her job, Gilbert suggests Mr. Crosby hire her. After seeing her, Crosby agrees. However, when Gilbert tries to see Carol, he finds she and Helen have moved away. He has an idea, however; he writes to her through his magazine, infuriating her. It works. When she comes back, he proposes to her.

The battalion is a subordinate unit of 555th Engineer Brigade. History The 864th Aviation Battalion was activated in December 1942 at Camp Geiger, Washington near Spokane. The Battalion served in the Pacific Theater during World War II, earning three campaign streamers for New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Luzon. The unit also earned the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation. The unit was deactivated in Japan on 30 June 1946. The army allotted the battalion to the organized Reserves and activated it at Morristown, New Jersey on 14 March 1949. The unit was deactivated the following September. In March 1951, the Army reactivated the battalion at Tulsa, Oklahoma, only to inactivate it a year later. In 1955 the battalion was withdrawn from the Army Reserve and allotted to the Regular Army. The 864th was reactivated at Wolters Air Force Base, Texas on 25 September 1955. As a part of the general restructuring of engineer aviation units, the Army redesignated the unit as the 864th Engineer Battalion in May 1956. In May 1965, the battalion was shipped to Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam. The battalion was the first U.S. engineer battalion-size unit in Vietnam and responsible for port transportation and support facilities construction. As more engineer battalions were assigned to Vietnam, the unit was assigned missions of base camp construction and line of communication construction and maintenance. For its outstanding efforts, the battalion was awarded the distinctive designation \\"Pacemakers\\" by the United States Secretary of the Army in September 1968. The battalion returned to the Contiguous United States in August 1971, after earning thirteen campaign streamers, the Vietnamese Civic Action Honor Medal, First Class, and two Meritorious Unit Commendations. In the Contiguous United States, the battalion was assigned to Fort Lewis, Washington. The battalion was reorganized in June 1976 as an Engineer Combat Battalion (Heavy). During the period 1983‚Äì1990, the battalion deployed vertical platoons to Honduras in support of the U.S. Southern Command. In 1987, the battalion was reorganized with a Headquarters and Support Company and three line companies, which included Delta Company which was stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco. In January 1991, the battalion deployed to Saudi Arabia for eight months in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. During this period, the 864th was responsible for construction of 290 miles of petroleum pipeline, the repair and maintenance of main supply routes, enemy prisoner of war camp construction, and provided emergency services restoration to Kuwait City. In 1992, the battalion deployed a platoon to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, providing humanitarian relief to Haitian refugees. In the winter of 1993, the battalion deployed to Arizona in support of Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6), providing a multitude of construction missions in support of the United States Border Patrol and various law enforcement agencies. In July 1993, Charlie Company, 864th Engineer Battalion was inactivated and colors retired. Bravo Company and support elements from HSC deployed to Honduras to build schools from June 1994 to September 1994. The battalion deployed elements from HSC, Alpha and Bravo Companies to McCall, Idaho in support of Task Force \\"Rugged-Pacemaker\\" to fight forest fires in the summer of 1994. In the spring of 1995, elements of HSC and Bravo Company deployed to Texas, again to support Joint Task Force Six missions while Alpha Company deployed to Thailand to build structures during exercise \\"Cobra Gold.\\" In June 1996, the Alpha Animals deployed to Haiti, for a one-year rotation, to construct schools and renovate a hospital for the locals. Meanwhile, HSC and elements of Bravo Company deployed to Hanford, Washington, with one day notice, to combat fires in that area. In April 1997, Bravo Company deployed to Thailand in support of \\"COBRA GOLD\\" to provide humanitarian and civic assistance, in the form of new construction and facilities upgrade. In February 1998, the battalion deployed to Laredo, Texas in support of Joint Task Force Six to conduct general engineering construction missions. Bravo also deployed to Alaska in September 1998 through October 1998 to conduct base camp and road construction in support of JTF ALASKAN ROAD. HSC and the Earth Moving Platoons from Alpha and Bravo company deployed to White Sands, New Mexico to conduct horizontal construction missions to include road and airfield construction, and two new golf course fairways and a driving range from February 1999 to April 1999. Meanwhile, in April 1999, Bravo company deployed a vertical platoon to Abilene, Texas in support of JTF-6 and the Abilene Police Department to construct a shoot house for their training facility. Shortly thereafter, in May 1999, Alpha company deployed to Thailand in support of \\"COBRA GOLD\\" to again provide humanitarian and civic assistance, in the form of new construction and facilities upgrade. Alpha company and elements from HSC and Bravo company deployed to KOSOVO to conduct base camp construction and facilities upgrade along with constructing and improving existing road networks for Camp Bondsteel and the NATO forces assigned there from August 1999 through February 2000. Meanwhile, Bravo and HSC were busy taking part in constructions missions that were vital to the Army's new Medium Brigade Transformation Project being conducted at Fort Lewis. In mid-2001 the battalion began to work closely with the President's counter-drug agency, JTF-6. In August, Alpha Company deployed to New York City to build a state-of- the-art classroom facility for the New York City Police Department. In March 2002, Alpha Company also deployed to Fallon, Nevada in order to build several training targets for the Naval air station located there. In March Bravo, Company was also busy planning for and then executing a training facility for JTF-6 in San Diego, California. Not to be outdone, HSC deployed to Alaska for an Alaskan Roads improvement program that lasted from June 2002 through September 2002. In March 2003, the 864th Engineer Battalion deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Battalion supported V Corps in the attack to liberate Iraq and during post- hostilities conducted extensive airfield construction and general engineering in support of CJTF-7 Operations. The battalion redeployed on 20 February 2004 to Fort Lewis, Washington. The 864th Engineer Battalion deployed again on 28 March 2005 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom IV, V, and VI to Afghanistan. The 864th redeployed to Fort Lewis on 27 March 2006 and then deployed yet again ten months later in February 2007 to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom VI, VII, and VIII. The 864th Engineer Battalion redeployed from Afghanistan in May 2008 and recently reformed into a construction battalion. In January 2010 864th also sent companies in support of both Operation's Enduring Freedom and New Dawn.

Freshwater marshes primarily consist of sedges, grasses, and emergent plants. Freshwater marshes are usually found near the mouths of rivers, along lakes, and are present in areas with low drainage like abandoned oxbow lakes. It is the counterpart to the salt marsh, an upper coastal intertidal zone of bio- habitat, which is regularly flushed with sea water.  Vegetation  Freshwater marshes are highly productive and therefore can support a large biodiversity of vegetation. Vegetation is a key component in determining the structure of a freshwater marsh. In a freshwater marsh, there are emergent plants, floating plants, floating leaved and submerged. The primary plant in freshwater marshes are emergent plants. Emergent plants are plants with soft stems and are highly adapted to live in saturated soils. Freshwater marshes have a lengthy growing season and contain high nutrient levels in the water and substrate, which contribute to an overall high net primary production. Some of the most common plants in these areas are cattails, water lilies, arrowheads, and rushes.  Animals  Many types of animals use freshwater marshes for habitat at some point in their life cycles. Birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish and macro-invertebrates can be found within freshwater marshes.Birds use freshwater marshes for nesting. Common species of birds found in a freshwater marsh include ducks, geese, swans, songbirds, swallows, coots, and black ducks. Although shallow marshes do not tend to support many fish, they are used as a nursery to raise young. The deeper ones are home to many species, including large fish such as the northern pike and carp.  Soil  Soils contain organic matter, air, water and mineral matter. The soil has very slow decomposition rates and is often black or brown. Soils are characterized by hue, chroma and value. The soils in wetlands are often hydric in nature, which means they are completely saturated and have no oxygen.  Hydrology  Freshwater marshes are dynamic ecosystems. Aspects of the water like depth, velocity, oxygen concentration, and temperature change frequently. Marshes can be classified based on their hydrology. Marshes can be flooded permanently, intermittently, temporarily, seasonally, and semi-permanently. Groundwater reserves, water moving across the surface and precipitation are the three main sources of water in marshes.  Functions and Services  Wetlands have many services and functions that benefit the Earth. Marshes can remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it in their biomass or the ground. Many of the wide variety of species that freshwater marshes can support, provide services to humans. Many different types of food are produced within a freshwater marsh like fruits, rice, vegetables like taro, and fish. Freshwater marshes can also provide clothing in the form of pelts and materials for building such as reeds. Freshwater marshes also provide recreational services like fishing, bird-watching, water fowl hunting, and trapping. Another important function of marshes is flood mitigation. Marshes can slow down the rate at which water is travelling and create a buffer zone to stop flooding.  Restoration  There are many different techniques to restoring a wetland. One common way freshwater marshes are restored is restoration of channelized rivers. When rivers are channelized and straightened, the marshes alongside the rivers disappear. Reverting rivers back to their natural state will allow nearby marshes to form again. Another way to restore freshwater marshes is to break down levees, dikes, and berms that impede rivers from flooding. Another technique to restore freshwater marshes is to re-plan cities and infrastructure to incorporate wetlands instead of draining them to build on them.  Notable Marshes  = Florida Everglades = The Florida Everglades represent the largest contiguous freshwater marsh in the entire world. This immense marsh covers and is located in the southern tip of Florida. The Everglades is home to animals such as the American Alligator, the Apple Snail and the Everglade Snail Kite. Alligators create depressions in the mud that retain water during the dry season. These wet depressions or alligator holes are important to fish, reptiles, and amphibians during the dry season. The vegetation of the Everglades include grasses, sedges, and other emergent hydrophytes. Continued human development, including drainage for development and polluted agriculture runoff, as well as alterations in the water cycle, threaten the existence of the Everglades. = Okavango Delta = The Okavango Delta in Botswana is one of Africa's largest freshwater marshes. Before the flowing water reaches the Okavango Delta, it comes from Angola and passes through Namibia. This marsh is so large that it can support commercial and recreational fishing. There are many tree islands within the Okavango marsh due to termites. Termites colonies build mounds in the dry season that later become flooded. The crowns of the mounds stay above water level and can support trees and other vegetation. The tree islands become a hot spot for biodiversity within the marsh. Continuous proposals for rerouting the river that fills the marsh is the main cause of concern for the future of this wetland. = Rift Valley = Rift Valley is located in Eastern Africa. Lake Naivasha is surrounded by tropical, freshwater marshes in the extensive 6,500 kilometer rift valley. These marshes are home to cattail, papyrus, and floating mats of other plants. This marsh is also home to ducks, herons, and crayfish. The rifting in the valley is enlarging the lake, creating more wetlands in the surrounding area. = Mesopotamian Marshlands = The Mesopotamian Marshlands are located in southern Iraq and Iran. The confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers create the Mesopotamian Marshlands. The Mesopotamian Marshlands were once the largest wetland ecosystem in the Middle East, covering an area of 15,000 to 20,000 square kilometers. In the 1980s and 1990s, this marshland was drained by upstream dams and water control structures, down to 10% of the original area. The marshland is located on the intercontinental flyway of migratory birds and is used by two-thirds of West Asia's water fowl. The marsh is currently dominated by an invasive grass, Phragmites australis.

The MR73 is manufactured by Manurhin and is available in 2.5\\", 2.75\\", 3\\", 4\\", 4.25‚Äù, 5.25\\", and 6\\" barrel lengths. Usage The MR 73 was standard issue with France's Gendarmerie and in some police units including Special Weapons and Tactics teams (RAID, GIGN and comparable units). The GIGN selected the MR 73 in part for its ability to almost indefinitely withstand 150 rounds of full-power ammunition during daily range practice. These teams also use MR 73s with Bushnell Magnum Phantom 1.5√ó telescopic sights and 8\\" and 10\\" barrels for tactical purposes. Over one million rounds were allegedly fired through one example. Specifications Every MR 73 is match grade accurate, shipped with its own factory test target fired at . Averaging 15 rounds, no group over diameter with selected ammunition is allowed. The MR 73 has an adjustable trigger weight in both double-action and single-action modes, a feature found in other high-end revolvers such as Korth and Janz. These adjustments do not alter the strength of the main spring, ensuring reliable primer ignition. This is due to the use of roller bearings in the trigger mechanism along with extensive hand fitting and polishing of components during assembly. The MR73 requires more than 12 hours of hand-fitting at the factory, making it about 50% more expensive than competing U.S.-manufactured brands. The revolver can be converted to 9√ó19mm Parabellum with a supplied replacement cylinder, however, 9√ó19mm Parabellum under French law has the status of ammunition of war. Thus, from the early 1980s, production was limited to the versions in .357. Cylinder chambers are finished with an impact process that makes them glass-smooth and extremely hard. The factory proof-fires each cylinder chamber with .357 Magnum ammunition generating 30% more pressure than the C.I.P. maximum allowable pressure for the Magnum cartridge. The factory guarantees that the cylinder will not burst or show any bulging or deformation with .357 Magnum ammunition developing double the C.I.P. Pmax piezo pressure, meaning the cylinder can withstand , or 43.5 tons per square inch).id. The frame, cylinder, and barrel of the MR 73 are made from ordnance-certified, alloyed steel. Barrels are manufactured by cold-hammering. The rifling is formed during the forging process, eliminating the need to cut the rifling as a separate manufacturing step. This creates an extremely hard and microscopically smooth internal barrel surface. MANURHIN S.A; had made a counterweight to use with Manurhin MR 73 5\\"1/2 and greater length and high quality walnut pistol grip. Trauch French armurier had created and sold a very efficiency polymer pistol grip quick draw. HKS make a speedloader (Model 10A) to use with .38, .357, and 9mm caliber cylinder. Variants A sporting variant called the MR 32 Match is produced in .32 S&W; Long. It was first produced in 1985. Other sporting variants are the MR 38 Match chambered in .38 Special and the MR 22 Match chambered in .22 Long Rifle. The Match versions feature only a single action trigger and have an extended rearward rise. This allows the aiming length to be increased without increasing the total length of the weapon, which would have made it exceed the maximum dimensions authorized in certain competitions.

Background, 1536‚Äì1612 The son of Giovanni Memmo and Bianca Sanudo, he was born into a family of average wealth. He went into business as a merchant and made a fortune through his careful management. As a prominent Venetian, he traversed the Venetian cursus honorum, becoming in turn, provveditore, podest√†, and Procurator of St Mark's. He was set to become doge in 1606, but was not helped by the fact that the Memmo were one of the \\"vecchie\\" (\\"old\\"), Venetian noble families and every doge from 1382 on had been a member of one of the \\"nuove\\" (\\"new\\") Venetian noble families. He was thus unable to win support for his election in 1606, and lost out to Leonardo Donato. Reign as Doge, 1612‚Äì1615 Memmo used the years of Donato's reign to maneuver behind the scenes, swinging into high gear following Donato's death on 16 July 1612. When the election was held on July 24, 1612, Memmo was elected on the first ballot, with 38 of the 41 votes, a shock to the nuove faction that had dominated the position of Doge for centuries. Great festivals were organized to celebrate Memmo's victory, and, like previous Doges, he would use the celebrations that attended great holidays as a way to curry favor with the population of Venice. Little of note happened in Memmo's reign as Doge, except for an incursion of Uskoci pirates in 1613. He died on October 31, 1615.

The story was written by Joseph Krumgold, suggested by the novel Purple and Fine Linen by May Edginton (spelled as Edington in the film). Plot Robbers steal the \\"Koor-Hal Ruby\\", killing four in the process, and elude the police. Newspaper managing editor Phil Bane sends for conceited crime writer/criminologist George Melville to write stories and boost his circulation. Melville claims the crime was masterminded by Andre Berlea, a man thought to have died four years before. He predicts to reporters that Berlea will next steal the Sunburst Diamond and kill the only witness, a butler, to the ruby theft. Seconds later, they receive news that a butler has been murdered. On his way to see Bane, Melville is about to give a female panhandler some money when he is distracted by a car accident. The woman takes the opportunity to steal his wallet. He follows her to a beauty salon. When she emerges, after a complete makeover, she begs him not to do anything until after 8 o'clock. Over dinner, she explains that she ran away from her cruel husband with another man, from whom she later separated. Her ex-husband is finally letting her see her daughter, who turned four that day, and she needed the money to make herself presentable. They drive to a fancy mansion. Mrs. Northrop faints when she is shown a coffin; Mr. Northrop explains that the child died two days before. However, all is not as it seems. It turns out to be an elaborate practical joke on Melville concocted by the reporters; one of them is writing a play, Fury's Road, and Claire Peyton (\\"Mrs. Northrop\\") is the star. Mr. Northrop was played by the producer, Blackton Gregory. Minutes later, they learn that a famous painting has been stolen from next door. Gregory savors his latest acquisition in secret. When a henchman suggests getting rid of Melville, Gregory turns him down. Having found a worthy foe, he will not do something so crude. He goes to see Melville and hires him to help with the play. He asks why Melville is so sure that Berlea is alive. Melville explains that he believes that Berlea has a compulsion to own beautiful things. Before he \\"died\\", he tried to buy three such objects, but was turned down. Now two of them have been stolen. Melville predicts that the third, the Starburst Diamond, will be purloined on Saturday at 11 pm. Bane has faith in him and keeps his staff after hours and notifies the authorities, who set up a stakeout at the bank where the jewel is stored. When the deadline passes without anything happening, Bane fires Melville. Melville agrees to go to Gregory's retreat for a rest. Gregory's men have dug a tunnel between the theater where the play, set on the front lines of World War I, will be performed and the bank. At the premiere, when mock explosions and firing are set off in a battle scene, they blast their way into the vault. When Peyton discovers the theft, she fears for Melville's life. However, Melville has been one step ahead of his nemesis, and later that night captures Gregory/Berlea. Furious at being fooled, she makes her own prediction: \\"to make him suffer for the rest of his life\\" ... by marrying him.

More recently, the Villa H√ºgel has housed the offices of the (Ruhr Cultural Foundation), an art gallery, the historical archive of the Krupp family and company, and a concert venue. simply means ‚Äúhill‚Äù, as the villa sits atop a hill. It was sometimes named ', after the family. Villa H√ºgel History In 1864 Alfred Krupp purchased the on the heights above Breydeney and had it rebuilt as a residence for his family. Over the following years, Krupp bought additional land around the estate and in 1869 placed an advertisement in ' looking for an architect who would turn his designs for a \\"large villa\\" into a viable blueprint. In the event, a number of architects worked on the project over the following years. Krupp himself continually intervened in the work with new ideas. His focus was very much on a modern and efficient house: design elements were secondary to him and he deemed most ornamental architectural features superfluous. The foundations were laid in April 1870 and up to 800 people worked on the construction project at a time. Since Alfred Krupp wanted a very modern home, the villa was intended to be fire- proof and well insulated from sun, wind, cold and heat. It featured double- paned windows, water heating and an early form of air conditioning. The temperature was intended to be independently adjustable for each room. A large complex of support buildings was erected nearby, including private water and gas works. Krupp pushed for a speedy completion, although the Franco-Prussian War and collapsing mining tunnels underneath the edifice slowed construction. On 10 January 1873, the family moved in; some of the technical features did not work as expected, however, so work continued after that. Alfred Krupp died in 1887. The family continued to use the Villa H√ºgel and Friedrich Alfred Krupp and his wife Margarethe made some significant changes to the house, adding sumptuous ornamentation. Among other heads of state and monarchs, Emperor Wilhelm II stayed at the Villa H√ºgel nine times. The current appearance of the villa is mostly due to the next generation of Krupps, Friedrich Alfred's daughter Bertha and her husband Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, who hired Ernst von Ihne to work on the building after 1912. He added wooden paneling to the interior and the owners furnished the villa with numerous works of art. An annex called the Little House () containing sixty rooms was used to confine Alfried Krupp in the aftermath of the Second World War.Exorcising Hitler: The Occupation and Denazification of Germany by Frederick Taylor, Bloomsbury Press Some parts of the villa were used to house members of the British post-war Control Commission, Germany (CCG) during 1946. Description The house has 269 rooms and occupies . It is situated in a park that overlooks the River Ruhr and the . The main complex consists of the three-storied (‚Äòresidence‚Äô) ‚Äì topped by a belvedere, which originally contained the air conditioning ducts ‚Äì and a three-storied (‚Äòlodging house‚Äô). The two were linked by a winter garden, now a two-storied building. The construction is supported by an iron framework, which was very modern for the time. The overall style of the original building was a very austere example of a late-Neoclassical villa; later changes added more ornamentation. The interior of the main building's ground and second floors is dominated by the main hall of over . By contrast, the rooms of the first floor (which is not open to the public) were kept relatively simple. Today The Villa H√ºgel is open to the public.

The Constitution does not expressly authorise the courts to review statutes, but the courts have established this right by precedence. Constitutionality is usually decided in the Supreme Court, but can be decided at lower levels of the judiciary. History As the Constitution does not mention whether the courts can overturn legislative acts as unconstitutional, it has been debated in Danish legal theory whether the courts are able to do this. However the courts have assumed this right which has been accepted by the government as well as Parliament. There have been little debate whether the courts were able to examine whether the formal constitutional procedures connected to the creation of a law has been followed. The courts have done this in a few cases, but have never ruled a law unconstitutional due to non-compliance with formal procedure. In 1912 the Supreme Court assumed that it had the power to try the constitutionality of tithe abolition laws. In 1921 the Supreme Court came close to declare a land reform law unconstitutional; and it was only because a judge changed his vote that the law was considered constitutional. In 1971, the Supreme Court was close to declare a law unconstitutional. The law demanded that a foundation under the University of Copenhagen was to transfer its collection of Icelandic manuscripts and its capital to the University of Iceland, along with the foundation's capital. The foundation contested that this was violating the constitutional ban on expropriation without compensation. The Supreme Court ruled that the foundation was to transfer the manuscripts without compensation, but not its capital. In a 1980 case concerning whether a law can ban private shipping companies from transporting goods to and from Greenland was heard. In reality there was only one company affected by the law, and the Eastern High Court ruled that the law expropriated the business of that shipping company and awarded the company a compensation. The only case where a law was ruled unconstitutional is from 1999, where several named individual schools from the Tvind network was cut off from government funding. The law was passed because the schools were suspected of receiving funding based on forged numbers of students. To avoid a lot of lawsuits, a law was passed cutting the Tvind schools from government funding and barring them from suing the government over the lost funding. The Supreme Court declared this to be a violation of the separation of powers and declared the law unconstitutional. Procedure As the Danish courts are formally only able to decide in concrete cases an unconstitutional law is technically still in force. However a court ruling that a law is unconstitutional means that authorities will not again try to apply the law as they would expect to be met with a lawsuit they are guaranteed to lose. There has been at least two cases on the constitutionality of Danish membership of the European Union. Since the courts are only competent to rule in concrete disputes not everyone can sue the state for passing an unconstitutional law. To do this the plaintiff has to have a legal interest in the case. However in 1996 the Supreme Court ruled that a group of citizens had legal interest in suing the prime minister over the law on accession to the European Union. The Supreme Court has taken the stance that Denmark's relation to the European Union was affecting the entire population in many substantial areas and that every Danish citizen thus had legal interest in the constitutionality of the question. Denmark has no specialised constitutional court and thus the question on the constitutionality of a law is to be contested before the ordinary courts. All courts are able to rule on the constitutionality of a law, but in practice such highly political cases would be appealed to the Supreme Court. As for judicial review of acts of the administration rather than pieces of legislation, Article 63 of the Danish Constitution provides that the judiciary is entitled to try any question relating to the limits to the executive's powers. This is traditionally construed to mean that beyond the sphere of criminal procedure, unless otherwise provided for by legislation, the judiciary may try any question of fact and of law, whereas courts traditionally do not review discretion exercised by the administration. In certain areas, however, such as tax law, courts exercise a wider review, as well as in cases concerning just reparation for expropriation of property, as provided for by Article 73(3) of the Danish Constitution. Other areas where the standard of scrutiny may traditionally be less extensive include, inter alia, cases of royal prerogative, such as foreign policy actions of the executive.

It was located north-northwest of Wawona. It is located within Yosemite National Park, adjacent to the community of Yosemite West . Chinquapin is the midway point between Yosemite Valley and Wawona, a community inside the park. History Chinquapin was built as a junction of the Old Glacier Point Road, which was built in 1882. Chinquapin Ranger Station Previously it was a bridle trail to Glacier Point (the current Glacier Point Road, which starts immediately north of the old road was built in 1940).Wawona Road (HAER No. CA-148) On an 1896 U.S. Cavalry map it is marked as \\"Chinquapin Station\\"\\"Yosemite National Park and Adjacent Territory\\" map from J. Smeaton Chase, Yosemite Trails (1911) It was named Chinquapin after Chinquapin Creek, which is immediately northwest of Chinquapin. Chinquapin Creek is today called Indian Creek. Chinquapin Creek (and therefore Chinquipin) was named for the Sierra Chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens) brush that grows in the area (with spiny seeds). Direction sign at Chinquapin in Yosemite National Park Chinquapin was the second ski area in Yosemite. This second ski area at Chinquapin was opened after the Wawona Tunnel was built (allowing Winter access). Before that, people skied on the glacial moraine in Yosemite Valley that is just east of the horse stables by the Pines Campgrounds. Later, the ski area moved from Chinquapin to Badger Pass on the Old Glacier Point Road. Today the ski area is in Simpson Meadow (below Badger Pass).Gene Rose, Magic Yosemite Winters: A Century of Winter Sports (2000) Chinquapin used to have a Gas Station up to the 1990s. Before that, the Gas Station was a small ski lodge (what some refer to as a \\"lunch room\\") that opened in 1933. The Gas Station was cleaned up as a toxic site by the park concessionaire (Delaware North) as a condition of their winning the Park concession in 1993 from the previous concessionaire (MCA Corporation). As referenced in the Yosemite Environmental Education Center, Final EIS report, \\"The Chinquapin Developed Area Cultural Landscape encompasses not only the features of the Chinquapin Historic District, but also includes the whole intersection as well as an associated water tank located approximately 600 feet from the Comfort Station (Sandy and DuBarton; 2007).

Chinquapin today is a stopping point with new restroom facilities utilizing \\"State of the Art\\" fixtures as a testing ground for new waste water systems. This effort ties well to the addition of the new Yosemite Institute campus adjacent to Yosemite West. This new Campus, part of NatureBridge, a Yosemite National Park non-profit partner, aims to promote visitor understanding, stewardship, and appreciation of diverse park environments. During the winter months, Chinquapin is used as a tire-chain installation point before the ascent to Badger Pass Ski Area. There are usually crews and rangers on hand during snowy periods to aid the visitor on proper installation of the chains on their vehicles. If weather conditions exceed the limits of safety or if Badger Pass ski area has no available parking spaces, rangers will close the gates to Glacier Point Road at the Chinquapin intersection to all ascending vehicles. Trailheads near Chinquapin The Deer Camp trailhead is just south of Chinquapin and Glacier Point Road. As you hike along the trail above Hwy 41, it passes over Rail Creek and Strawberry Creek on its way to Deer Camp on Empire Meadow. The trail's endpoint is at the town of Wawona. The Old Glacier Point Trail begins at Chinquapin and is the only other trail in the vicinity of the site. It begins about 100 feet behind the bathroom facility, behind the old water tank in Chinquapin. As the name suggests it is the former road and leads northeast.

It comprises two different aspects: firstly, judicial review of domestic legislation as to their compatibility with the Basic Law (\\"constitutional review\\"); secondly, judicial review of administrative decisions under administrative law (\\"administrative review\\"). Constitutional review Under the Basic Law, the court of Hong Kong is also delegated with the power to interpret the Basic Law. Thus, it is recognised by the Hong Kong courts that they have jurisdiction to check whether the executive or legislature are working within the boundaries of the Basic Law. Similar to the United States, Hong Kong courts have held that they may review as to whether legislation passed by the legislature is in compliance with the Basic Law. This is different from the situation in the UK where the court may have no such jurisdiction under the traditional doctrine of parliamentary supremacy. The Hong Kong courts observed that reviewing legislation is possible because the legislature in Hong Kong is not, unlike its UK counterpart, supreme. Article 39 of the Basic Law entrenches the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as a core constitutional document for Hong Kong. No legal restrictions on the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents may contravene the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong. The ICCPR applies to Hong Kong primarily through the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO), which was enacted in 1991. In fact, the BORO was the subject of many cases of judicial review before 1997. In particular, R v Sin Yau Ming, a 1992 case involving the presumption of innocence in the BORO, set the stage for future judicial review. Administrative review The Basic Law provides that the previous law in force in Hong Kong, including Common Law, will be preserved. Thus, administrative review, as part of the Common Law, is also preserved. The basis of administrative review is sometimes said to be Article 35 of the Basic Law, which reads: There is, however, debate on this. Hong Kong's administrative law has procedural and substantive similarities with English administrative law, but with various differences. Procedure =Leave to apply for judicial review= Before applying for judicial review, a person must first obtain the leave of the Court of First Instance of the High Court by filing Form 86 (together with an affidavit verifying the relevant facts and the filing fee of HK$1,045).High Court Ordinance (Cap. 4), Section 21K(3)Rules of the High Court (Cap. 4A), Order 53, rule 3Practice Direction SL3, paragraphs 12-13High Court Fees Rules (Cap. 4D) As explained by the Court of Final Appeal, the requirement to obtain leave to apply for judicial review serves as 'an important filter ... to prevent public authorities from being unduly vexed with unarguable challenges'., reported at (2007) 10 HKCFAR 676. An applicant must exhaust all revenues of appeal or alternative remedies before applying for leave for judicial review unless there are exceptional circumstances., reported at [2014] 6 HKC 256. In Form 86, the grounds of judicial review must be set out 'clearly, succinctly and in a few numbered paragraphs' addressing the 'real issues in the case', together with the relevant facts. It is the duty of the applicant to include in Form 86 and the accompanying affidavit all material facts of which he/she is aware (even though such facts may be adverse to his/her case), as well as potential legal answers to his/her claim. If leave is granted, but the applicant has failed to comply with this duty of full and frank disclosure, it is viewed as a 'serious matter' by the Court (even if it is an 'inadvertent' oversight) and leave may be set aside. and 37 In addition, a legally-aided applicant may be ordered to personally bear all of his/her own legal costs, as well as the respondent's legal costs. Form 86 must generally be filed promptly and in any event no later than 3 months from the date of the decision which is being challenged.Rules of the High Court (Cap. 4A), Order 53, rule 4Practice Direction SL3, paragraph 9 If this deadline is missed, a Judge of the Court of First Instance may exercise his/her discretion to grant an extension of time if there is a 'good reason'.Stephen Thomson, 'Leave Without Delay: The Requirement to Make Prompt Application for Leave to Apply for Judicial Review' (2015) 45(2) Hong Kong Law Journal 449-468, reported at [2014] 6 HKC 1., reported at [2016] 2 HKC 393., reported at [2016] 2 HKLRD 520, at para. 135 A Judge of the Court of First Instance will grant leave to apply for judicial review if he or she is persuaded that there is a reasonably arguable claim which has a realistic prospect of success.

Controversy On 3 December 2015, Henry Litton, a retired judge who sat on the Court of Final Appeal, caused controversy by his claim that the system of judicial review had been \\"abused\\". \\"Judicial review is not available for challenges to government policy,\\" he said. \\"That is a fundamental rule in the separation of powers. The court is concerned with law, not policy.\\" Litton also criticized the way judges dealt with judicial review cases. Shortly afterwards, Winnie Tam, chair of the Bar Association, told the media that not every unsuccessful case of judicial review represented an abuse of the system. On 14 December, government spokesman Andrew Fung questioned the neutrality of barristers who disagreed with Litton. He suggested that there may be a conflict of interest, since some barristers profit from judicial review cases. He also complained of the costs incurred by delay caused by judicial review. On the same day, former chief justice Andrew Li wrote in an op-ed that \\"the pursuit of efficiency must not be at the expense of justice.\\" He believed that Litton's criticism of judges was unjustified. On 12 January 2016, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying told reporters that while judicial reviews are provided for under Hong Kong's legal system and serve to monitor the Government's work, the judicial review system is sometimes abused. Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma also defended the system against attacks on its inconvenience. \\"Although there may occasionally be inconveniences, judicial review overall serves the public interest and facilitates the well-being of our society,\\" he said in his speech at the Ceremonial Opening of the Legal Year 2016. \\"This status should properly be recognised.\\" References Category:Hong Kong law Hong Kong ","title":"Judicial review in Hong Kong"},{"id":"23177036","title":"2012 Republican Party presidential candidates"},{"id":"23177038","text":"Elevenmile (also, Eleven Mile Station and 11-Mile House) is a former settlement in Mariposa County, California.

Since 1994, the Constitution has stipulated that no law or other regulation may violate the European Convention (Ch. 2, art. 19 of the Instrument of Government). Traditionally, a more important check on the ability of the Riksdag to pass laws in violation of the rights provided by the Constitution has been the judicial preview exercised by the Council on Legislation..

In consequence, the courts are not empowered to review the constitutionality of federal statutes, but will, where possible, construe statutes so as not to create a conflict with the Constitution. The courts can suspend the application of federal statutes that conflict with international law, but tend to exercise this power cautiously and deferentially: In Schubert (BGE 99 Ib 39), the Federal Supreme Court refused to do so because Parliament had consciously violated international law in drafting the statute at issue. The reason traditionally given for the lack of judicial review is the Swiss system of popular democracy: If 50,000 citizens so demand, any new statute is made subject to a popular referendum. In this sense, it is the people themselves that exercise review. The situation described above for Swiss federal law applies mutatis mutandis to the constitutional and legal systems of the individual cantons. However, owing to the derogatory power of federal law, federal courts as a matter of course exercise judicial review on cantonal law, as well as on federal executive law (ordinances, executive orders etc.).

The power of judicial review of all actions of governmental and private bodies in Scotland is held by the Court of Session. The procedure is governed by Chapter 58 of the Rules of Court. Approximately 600 judicial review cases are raised every year, but most are settled by agreement with only a small minority having to be decided by the court. Procedure There is a 3-month time limit on seeking judicial review, (see Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014) although if proper administration is prejudiced by delay on the part of the pursuer, the court may exercise its discretion and refuse to grant a review. Despite the procedural differences, the substantive laws regarding the grounds of judicial review in Scotland are similar to those in other western legal systems, with decisions in one jurisdiction regarded as highly persuasive in the others. There is, however, one substantial difference in Scotland since there is no distinction between review of a public body and a private body, which is different from, for example, judicial review in England and Wales, where review is only possible in the case of a public body or a quasi-public body (West v. Secretary of State for Scotland). Generally, review is confined to purely procedural grounds (the official action was illegal or improper), although the court will also sanction decisions which are, in substance, so unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have reached it (so- called Wednesbury unreasonableness). A more rigorous standard of substantive review is applied where the matter complained of touches upon the pursuer's rights in terms of the Human Rights Act 1998.

The Graham School extends the University of Chicago‚Äôs intellectual mission to a broad community of students who seek professional skills or personal development via part-time and flexible programs of study. The Graham School fosters the University‚Äôs rigorous approach to learning and scholarship in the form of graduate degrees, certificate programs, and open courses in the professional studies, humanities, arts, and sciences. The Graham School offers five Master's programs, over 18 certificate programs, and a variety of credit and non-credit courses for graduate students at large, returning scholars, and adult learners. In addition, the Graham School manages the University of Chicago Summer Session, a series of academic programs for high school students, visiting college students, and international students, and conducts lecture series and other programs throughout the year. The Graham School's administrative offices can be found on the University of Chicago's main campus in the Hyde Park neighborhood. Summer Session programs and some courses are also held on the main campus. The majority of Graham School courses are conducted at the University of Chicago Gleacher Center in downtown Chicago. History The Gleacher Center Founded alongside the University of Chicago in 1890, the University's continuing education division operated in similar fashion to the Chautauqua movement at Oxford and Cambridge, with instructors traveling by train to teach in surrounding communities. The continuing education branch was reformed in 1997 with a $10 million donation from William and Catherine Graham, upon which the name of the division was changed to the William B. and Catherine V. Graham School of General Studies. On July 1, 2011 the school updated its name to the University of Chicago Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. =Graduate Studies= The Graham School offers four Master's degrees and for-credit graduate-level courses through the Graduate Student-at-Large program: * Master of Science in Analytics * Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics * Master of Liberal Arts * Master of Science in Threat and Response Management * Graduate Student- at-Large The Graham School also offers graduate coursework without enrolling in a degree program through its Graduate Student-at-Large and Returning Scholar programs. Graduate students-at-large take University of Chicago graduate courses for grades and build a transferable record of study for matriculation into a degree program at the University of Chicago or elsewhere. Returning scholars audit University of Chicago courses, but are not graded for their work and do not build a transferable record of study. =Certificate Programs= Graham School certificate programs span a wide variety of topics from integrated marketing courses to liberal arts and humanities and are offered on a part-time basis. Upon completion of requirements, a certificate stating mastery of the given area is earned by the student. Because most courses are open-enrollment, students may take certificate courses without enrolling in a certificate program. These certificate programs fall under two broad categories: Humanities, Arts, and Sciences and Professional Programs. Humanities Arts and Sciences provides intensive study on a specific, grounded in the tenets of a liberal arts education. The Basic Program of Liberal Education for Adults, modeled after the University of Chicago Common Core, exposes students to the Great Books of antiquity and the Socratic method of teaching and discussion. The Graham School offers Humanities, Arts, and Sciences certificates in the following area: * Basic Program of Liberal Education for Adults Professional Programs are short, intensive seminars aimed at students in the workforce. They offer educational expansion opportunities in 11 areas relevant to the modern business world. Upon completion of the required number of courses, a certificate showing the student‚Äôs mastery of the particular skill set involved is awarded. The Graham School offers Professional Development Certificates in the following areas: * Clinical Trials Management and Regulatory Compliance * Conscious Leadership and Team Management * Data Analytics for Business Professionals * Digital Marketing and Integrated Communications * Editing * Financial Management and Decision- Making * Medical Writing and Editing *Medical Physics * Project Management =Non-credit Courses= The Graham School‚Äôs non-credit offerings cover a wide variety of topics and are aimed at the college graduate who wishes to either expand their knowledge of a certain area or learn a marketable job skill. Non- credit courses are offered in the following areas: *Basic Program of Liberal Education for Adults *Know Your Chicagohttps://knowyourchicago.org *Museum Publishing Seminar *Open-to-All Courses in the Liberal Arts * The Writer's Studio * A Fortnight in Oxford Courses in certificate programs may also be taken, without enrolling in the certificate program. =Urban Teacher Education Program= The Graham School operates the Urban Teacher Education Program (UTEP) for Chicago Public Schools teachers. UTEP is a five-year program; students first go through a two-year Master of Arts in Teaching and licensure program, then a three-year series of \\"post-graduation supports.\\" Summer Session The Graham School is also responsible for the University of Chicago Summer Session. Summer Session is open to anyone who wishes to attend, though participants are divided by academic standing. Courses run from the middle of June, after the University of Chicago lets out (technically the Summer Quarter), in four sessions that last anywhere from three to nine weeks. Students live in the University's Max Palevsky Residential Commons and are supervised by Residential Heads and student Resident Assistants. Faculty Faculty for the Graham School comes from a wide variety of sources, though the majority of instructors are pulled from the University of Chicago at large. The Graham School has a tradition of using working professionals to teach in its business-oriented courses and certificate programs, as well as acquiring published authors to lead courses in their particular writing genre. Public Events The Graham School offers multiple lecture series open to the public.

See Old Book of Tang, vol. 178, and New Book of Tang, vol. 185. In 885, Emperor Xizong bestowed many posthumous honors on Zheng, establishing that he was no longer living by that point. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 19, part 2. The Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang disagreed about his death age, with the Old Book of Tang giving it as 58 and the New Book of Tang giving it as 62.), courtesy name Taiwen (), formally Duke Wenzhao of Xingyang (),Old Book of Tang, vol. 19, part 2. was a chancellor of late Tang Dynasty, serving two terms as chancellor during the reign of Emperor Xizong. He was heavily involved in the Tang campaign against the agrarian rebel Huang Chao and Huang Chao's state of Qi.  Background and early career  Assuming that Zheng Tian died in 883, he might have been born in either 821 or 825. He was a part of the prominent Zheng clan based in Xingyang (ÊªéÈôΩ, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), but his traceable ancestry only went as far back as his great- grandfather Zheng Shaolin (), who served as a civil service official under the prefect of Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou).New Book of Tang, vol. 75 Zheng Shaolin, as well as Zheng Tian's grandfather Zheng Mu () and Zheng Tian's father Zheng Ya (), all passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class, and while Zheng Mu served only as a county magistrate, Zheng Ya became well known for his abilities, and he became a close associate of the chancellor Li Deyu, who was particularly powerful during the reign of Emperor Wuzong, eventually serving as a high level imperial consultant. Other than Zheng Tian, Zheng Ya had at least two younger sons, Zheng Jun () and Zheng Pi (). Zheng Tian himself passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class when he was 17, and thereafter served as a staff member under the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). When he was 21, he further passed a special examination for those who made good rulings, and he was made the sheriff of Weinan County (Ê∏≠Âçó, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) and a historian who would edit imperial histories. Before he could serve in those positions, however, in 847, due to his association with Li Deyu, who had lost power during the reign of the then-reigning Emperor XuƒÅnzong (Emperor Wuzong's uncle), Zheng Ya was demoted to be prefect of Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi), and Zheng Tian followed his father to Gui Prefecture, where Zheng Ya would die, probably around 849. (This chronology appeared to make it more likely that Zheng Tian was born in 825 or later, as he would have been 22 in 851 if born in 825, whereas he would already be 26 if born in 821.) As, during Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign, the court scene was dominated by the chancellor Bai Minzhong and then Linghu Tao, both of whom had no liking for Li Deyu and ejected Li Deyu's associates, Zheng Tian was not given an imperial government office for a long time.  During Emperor Yizong's reign  During the Xiantong era (860‚Äì874) of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son Emperor Yizong, after Linghu Tao had left the office of the chancellors, Liu Zhan, who was then the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), invited Zheng Tian to serve on his staff. Subsequently, Zheng Tian was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as Yubu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu). However, at that time, Zheng Xun (), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), which the ministry of public works belonged to, was a follower of Linghu's, and he prevented Zheng Tian from actually taking office by making false accusations against Zheng Tian, and Zheng Tian left Chang'an again to serve on a governor staff (possibly under Liu). Not until 864 was Zheng Tian again recalled to Chang'an to serve as Xingbu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu). After Liu became chancellor in 869, Liu recommended Zheng Tian, and Zheng became an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi) as well as Hubu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu). He was soon also put in charge of drafting edicts, and also made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). During the imperial armies' campaign against the rebel Pang Xun, who occupied Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) in 869, Zheng was largely in drafting the numerous edicts involved in the military maneuvers, and it was said that his colleagues admired him for the speed and the elegance with which he wrote. He was soon promoted to be both deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and, after Pang's rebellion was suppressed, chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi). In 870, after the death of Emperor Yizong's favorite daughter Princess Tongchang (), Emperor Yizong, in grief, executed the imperial physicians who were unable to save her and further arrested some 300 of their family members. Liu tried to intercede on their behalf and drew Emperor Yizong's anger. With the chancellor Lu Yan and Princess Tongchang's husband Wei Baoheng making false accusations against Liu, Liu was exiled. When Zheng was ordered to draft the edict announcing Liu's exile, he used language that outwardly rebuked Liu but instead praised Liu. Lu thus had Zheng exiled and demoted to be the prefect of Wu Prefecture (Ê¢ßÂ∑û, in modern Wuzhou, Guangxi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252.  During Emperor Xizong's reign  = Before and during first term as chancellor = After Emperor Yizong died in 873 and was succeeded by his young son Emperor Xizong, Zheng Tian was gradually moved closer to the capital‚Äîfirst to Chen Prefecture (ÈÉ¥Â∑û, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan) and then to Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). He was then recalled to Chang'an to serve as You Sanqi Changshi (), a high-level advisor at the legislative bureau. In 874, by which time he had become the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang), he was again made chief imperial scholar and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. At that time, typically, the armies posted to the southern circuits (i.e., Lingnan East Circuit (Â∂∫ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), Lingnan West Circuit (Â∂∫ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Nanning, Guangxi), and Jinghai Circuit (ÈùúÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Hanoi, Vietnam)) were supplied with food supplies from five circuits to the north, and the supplies had to be shipped by sea ships, which were frequently wrecked at great loss of life and resources. At Zheng's suggestion, the imperial control over the salt and iron monopolies in the region was transferred to Wei He () the military governor of Lingnan East, who was authorized to boil water to produce salt for sale, and then use the proceeds to buy food supplies from the prefectures in the southern parts of Jiangxi Circuit (Ê±üË•ø, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi). It was said that it was after this that the food supplies for the armies posted to the southern regions became fuller. Thereafter, the general Wang Shifu (), who served as Wei's deputy in Wei's role as the commander of the Lingnan East army, requested to be made the commander of the Lingnan East army and offered the imperial treasury a large amount of tax supplies. Zheng pointed out the absurdity‚Äîthat Wang was proposing to replace Wei despite Wei's contributions by offering money. As a result, Wang was removed from his office. Thereafter, Zheng was created the Marquess of Xingyang. By 876, the central/southern Tang realm was being overrun with agrarian rebellions, the chief of which was led by Wang Xianzhi. Zheng's suggestions regarding how to react to the rebellion were largely ignored. As a result, he offered to resign, but Emperor Xizong did not accept his resignation. In 877, a dispute erupted between Zheng and his chancellor colleagues Wang Duo and Lu Xi‚Äîas Wang Duo and Lu wanted to put the general Zhang Zimian () under the command of Song Wei (), who oversaw the operations against Wang Xianzhi, but Zheng, believing that, because of a pre-existing rivalry between Zhang and Song, that Song would find an excuse to have Zhang killed if Zhang came under Song's command, refused to endorse the petition that Wang Duo and Lu drafted. The dispute became so great that Wang Duo and Lu offered to resign, and Zheng offered to retire. Emperor Xizong did not approve any of these resignations.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. (The disagreement between Zheng and Lu was despite the fact that they were cousins, as their mothers were sisters to each other and the official Li Ao ()New Book of Tang, vol. 184. In 878, Zheng and Lu had another major dispute‚Äîover whether a Tang princess should be sent to Dali to marry Dali's emperor Longshun () to end the war between the two states, as proposed by the general Gao Pian. Lu supported the marriage proposal, while Zheng opposed. As they argued, the dispute became so vehement that Lu threw an inkstone onto the ground, breaking it. When Emperor Xizong heard about this, he commented, \\"When the great officials curse each other like this, how can they govern the other officials?\\" As a result, both Zheng and Lu were removed from their chancellor posts and given the entirely honorary titles as advisors to the Crown Prince (there being no crown prince at the time), and they were both further sent to the eastern capital Luoyang. They were replaced with Doulu Zhuan and Cui Hang. = Between first and second terms as chancellor = Shortly after Zheng Tian's demotion, however, he was recalled back to Chang'an to serve as the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). The next year, he became the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). While at Fengxiang, he conscripted 500 elite soldiers, and it was said that it was because of these soldiers that the banditry in the circuit subsided. In 880, the agrarian rebel leader Huang Chao attacked and captured Chang'an. Emperor Xizong fled toward Chengdu. On the way, as he was going through Luo Valley (Èß±Ë∞∑, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), Zheng intercepted him and begged him not to leave Chang'an's vicinity, requesting that he go to Fengxiang instead. However, Emperor Xizong, apprehensive of further attacks from Huang, refused, and told Zheng that he would entrust Zheng with the responsibilities of defending against further attacks by Huang. At Zheng's request, Emperor Xizong further authorized him to carry out actions without first seeking imperial approval.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Meanwhile, though, when Zheng returned to Fengxiang, the Fengxiang army was fearful of an attack by Huang, and thus there were murmurs that Zheng should submit to Huang. Huang, who had declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qi, further sent emissaries to Fengxiang to declare a general pardon (i.e., to pardon Zheng and the Fengxiang forces for resisting him). Zheng refused to meet with Huang's emissaries, and instead entered a pledge with the soldiers to defend Tang. At that time, many of the imperial guard soldiers could not catch up with Emperor Xizong on his flight to Chengdu, and Zheng summoned them to Fengxiang to have them join his army, spending his own personal wealth to placate them. When Huang further sent his general Wang Hui () to Fengxiang to try to persuade Zheng to submit, Zheng had Wang beheaded. Thereafter, Emperor Xizong bestowed the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title on Zheng again, as an honorary title, and made him the overall commander of Tang forces in the Chang'an region. In spring 881, Huang had his generals Shang Rang and Wang Bo () launch a major attack on Fengxiang. As the Qi army viewed Zheng as a civilian who did not know about military matters, they took few precautions. Zheng counterattacked with his ally Tang Hongfu (), and they dealt the Qi forces a major defeat at Longwei Slope (ÈæçÂ∞æÈôÇ, in modern Baoji). Zheng subsequently issued a declaration calling for the armies of the entire empire to attack Qi. It was said that it was only because of Zheng's declaration that the people of the empire found out that Emperor Xizong was still alive. In summer 881, with Zheng, Tang Hongfu, Cheng Zongchu (), Wang Chongrong, Wang Chucun, and Tuoba Sigong converging on Chang'an, Huang abandoned it. However, after Tang forces entered Chang'an, they began pillaging the capital, such that they became bogged down. Qi forces then counterattacked, killing Cheng and Tang Hongfu, and dealing the other Tang forces major losses. Tang forces were forced to again abandon Chang'an, allowing Qi forces to retake it. As the campaign waged on, the Fengxiang storage became depleted. In winter 881, the Fengxiang officer Li Changyan, who was then stationed at Xingping (ËààÂπ≥, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), provoked the soldiers and led them to return to Fengxiang in order to attack Zheng. Zheng, not wanting to see a battle between Tang soldiers, surrendered the city to Li Changyan, and fled south toward Chengdu as well. Once he reached Feng Prefecture (È≥≥Â∑û, in modern Baoji), he submitted a report to Emperor Xizong explaining what had occurred and offering to resign. Emperor Xizong made Li Changyan the military governor of Fengxiang, while making Zheng an advisor to the Crown Prince, with his office at Luoyang. = Second term as chancellor and aftermaths = In spring 882, Emperor Xizong summoned Zheng to Chengdu, making him chancellor again, along with the titles of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) and Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng)), giving him the most key responsibilities over the military matters. It was said that despite the imperial government's exile status, Zheng insisted on proper adherence to regulations‚Äîsuch that, by 883, by which time Huang had again abandoned Chang'an and Emperor Xizong was preparing to return to Chang'an, Zheng had offended the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi and Tian's brother Chen Jingxuan, the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu), as he rebuffed Tian Lingzi's request to have his assistant Wu Yuan () promoted and Chen's desire to receive greater honors than chancellors. Tian Lingzi and Chen thus instigated Li Changyan into submitting a petition that stated, \\"The soldiers are apprehensive. Therefore, when Your Imperial Majesty goes through Fengxiang, Zheng Tian should not follow.\\" Zheng thus submitted his resignation. He was thus removed from his chancellor post and made a senior advisor to the Crown Prince.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. His son Zheng Ningji () was made the prefect of Peng Prefecture (ÂΩ≠Â∑û, in modern Chengdu), and Zheng was sent to Peng Prefecture to recuperate from an illness that he was apparently having at the time. He died soon thereafter.  References   Sources  = Primary sources = * Old Book of Tang, vol. 178. * New Book of Tang, vol. 185. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 252, 253, 254, 255.

Early life Verney was born in Brasted, Kent on 23 October 1699, the fifth son of George Verney, 12th Baron Willoughby de Broke and his wife Margaret Heath, daughter of Sir John Heath of Brasted. He matriculated at New College, Oxford on 11 October 1714, aged 15, and was admitted at the Middle Temple in 1715. He was called to the Bar ex gratia in 1721. On 16 September 1724 he married Abigail Harley, the daughter of Sir Edward Harley, the younger brother of Queen Anne's Tory minister, Robert Harley, created Earl of Oxford. Career In an attempt to gain contacts for his work as a barrister, Verney decided to stand for Parliament. At the 1722 British general election he was returned as Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for Downton with the help of his brother-in-law, Anthony Duncombe. He spoke on 22 January 1724 against the Government of the Whig Prime Minister Robert Walpole on a motion for maintaining the existing strength of the army. In 1726 he switched sides, and supported the government on a similar motion on 28 January 1726. At the end of the year he was rewarded by being appointed a Welsh judge as 2nd justice of Brecon circuit. He was returned as MP after the consequential by-election, and a few days he spoke for the Government on an opposition motion about sending a fleet to the Baltic. In 1727 he became a King's Counsel. At the 1727 British general election he stood again at Downton and also at Radnor as a back up. He was unsuccessful at Radnor, but was returned again for Downton. In 1728 he was made a Bencher at Lincoln's Inn, having switched Inns some time earlier. Verney spoke in a financial debate on 4 March 1728 but he apparently displayed gross ignorance in a ridiculous contribution. In May 1729 he was made Attorney General to the Queen Consort, Queen Caroline. In 1730 and 1731 he spoke in support of the Hessians and against a petition to abolish the East India Company's monopoly. He resigned from his Welsh post in 1732 because of ill- health, but accepted an appointment as Chief Justice of Cheshire. On 8 February 1733 he opposed the receipt of a petition from the York Buildings Society stating that ‚Äòthe law would redress any abuses of this nature‚Äô, but the House did not take his advice. At the 1734 British general election Verney stood aside at Downton as the seat was taken by Duncombe for himself. He was again defeated at Radnor and so was out of Parliament. After the death of Sir Joseph Jekyll on 19 August 1738, Verney applied to succeed him as Master of the Rolls, and was accepted after the position was turned down by Sir John Strange. He took office on 9 October 1738, and was sworn in on 12 October. After a few years, his ill-health made it impossible to continue as Master of the Rolls, and he offered his resignation to the Lord Chancellor in early 1741. At the 1741 British general election he was returned again for Downton, but died before Parliament met. Death and legacy Verney died on 5 August 1741 leaving a son and two daughters. His son John, succeeded his childless uncle (Verney's brother) as Baron Willoughby de Broke.

Hamburg's Tapete Records once again released both cds in Europe and the United States. Hit Parade garnered more favorable press like \\"Nourallah has assembled the best album of his career...\\" Nourallah also formed a new band called the Travoltas, his first since he dis-banded the Happiness Factor in 2003. The Travoltas released a debut CD that was recorded in just 3 days and then undertook a two-week tour of the Midwest and East Coast with the Old 97s in October. Skeleton Closet, the 6th full-length record, finally emerged in August 2015. After two successful fan funding drives Nourallah released it on his own HIT records label. The record was over 4 years in the making as initial tracks were started during the recording sessions that yielded Hit Parade. Tours with Wreckless Eric, Adam Levy (the Honeydogs), Rhett Miller, Alex Dezen (the Damnwells) & Billy Harvey made 2015 Nourallah's most active year as a performer. He also released a 6-song E.P. called Terlingua as a companion to Skeleton Closet and then toured the Western half of the US opening for the Old 97s with just a 1979 Panasonic boom box as his backing band. 2017 saw the release of A Break in the Battle, a collection of 15 cover songs recorded with the help of long-time friends and collaborators, Chris Holt and Paul Averitt. Some of Nourallah‚Äôs favorite songs were the focus - Prefab Sprout, the Replacements, Comsat Angels and Diesel Park West provided some of the source material. September 2018 saw the release of the double album, Somewhere South of Sane. Nourallah undertook a short tour of Texas with Marty Willson-Piper from the Church and Laish. Laish is the moniker for British singer-songwriter, Danny Green. It was also a big year for Palo Santo Records, the record label Nourallah co-founded. The label released debut records by Xuan, Broken Baby and Sleepy Zuhoski as well as re-issuing The Loyal Serpent from Diesel Park West frontman John Butler. Producer In 2006 the Dallas Observer gave Salim Nourallah's 2nd LP, Beautiful Noise, awards for Best Song and Best Producer.

Born in Galway, Duggan arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Galway senior team. He made his debut in the 1943 championship. Duggan went on to play a key part as the last line of defence for more than a decade, however, he enjoyed little success in terms of silverware. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. Duggan represented the Connacht inter-provincial team at various times throughout his career, winning one Railway Cup medal in 1947. At club level he won two championship medals with Liam Mellows. Throughout his career, Duggan made 12 championship appearances for Galway. His retirement came following Galway's defeat by Cork in the 1953 All-Ireland final. His brothers, Jimmy and Paddy, all played with distinction for Galway, while their sister, Monica, was a renowned camogie player. Duggan is widely regarded as one of the greatest hurlers in the history of the game. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including as goalkeeper on a special Team of the Century composed of players never to have won an All-Ireland medal. Playing career =Club= Duggan played his club hurling with his local Liam Mellows club and enjoyed some success. He won back-to-back county titles with the club in 1945 and 1946. =Inter-county= Duggan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene when he made his debut in a 7-0 to 6-2 All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Antrim in 1943. The rest of the decade saw Galway lose consecutive All-Ireland semi-finals. In 1951 Galway made a long- overdue breakthrough on the national scene. A 6-7 to 3-4 defeat of Wexford secured victory in the \\"home\\" National Hurling League final. A narrow 2-11 to 2-8 defeat of New York in the actual league final gave Duggan a National League medal. Two years later in 1953 Galway defeated a star-studded Kilkenny team in the penultimate stage of the championship. This victory allowed Duggan's side to advance to the All-Ireland final where Cork provided the opposition. The game itself is remembered as one of the ugliest championship deciders ever and is clouded in controversy due to the injury to the Galway captain, Mick Burke. Galway lost the game by 3-3 to 0-8. After the match at the Gresham Hotel in Dublin a fight broke out when another Galway player struck Cork's Christy Ring. The following morning another fight broke out when another member of the Galway panel attempted to hit Ring. The fights, however, ended just as quickly as they had started. This defeat brought the curtain down on Duggan's inter-county career. =Inter-provincial= Duggan also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He won his sole Railway Cup medal in 1947 as his side defeated Munster.

The route served as a connector between NY 283 southeast of Alexandria Bay in the hamlet of Browns Corners and NY 37 in the hamlet of Redwood. It was long and passed through open fields for most of its length. NY 287 was originally designated as part of NY 3 in 1924. In 1930, NY 3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow a more southerly routing across the North Country. The Browns Corners‚ÄìRedwood portion of its former alignment was redesignated as New York State Route 26B by the following year. NY 26, NY 26B's parent route, was truncated southward in the on July 1, 1977; as a result, NY 26B was redesignated as NY 287\\\\. In 1979, ownership and maintenance of NY 287 was transferred from the state of New York to Jefferson County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The route is now designated as County Route 192 (CR 192). Route description First eastbound reassurance marker on CR 192 (former NY 287) in Browns Corners NY 287 began at an intersection with NY 283 southeast of Alexandria Bay in Browns Corners, a hamlet within the town of Alexandria. It headed southeast from the small community and gradually curved to the northeast as it proceeded through large, cultivated fields in an isolated portion of Jefferson County. West of Redwood, NY 287 had only four intersections with other highways, two of which were for a local road that began and ended at the state highway. About outside of Redwood, NY 287 passed over Jewett Creek as it entered a small forest situated adjacent to the hamlet. On the opposite side of the forest, NY 287 entered Redwood, a small, residential community bordered to the south and east by Mud Lake and Butterfield Lake, respectively. It continued east for two blocks to a junction with NY 37 near the northern edge of the hamlet, where NY 287 ended. History The east‚Äìwest highway connecting Browns Corners to Redwood was originally designated as part of Route 27, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature on March 1, 1921. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 27 northeast of Clayton became part of NY 3\\\\. NY 3, a cross-state highway that began in Erie County and ended in Clinton County, entered Browns Corners on modern NY 26 and left Redwood on what is now NY 37. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 3 was rerouted east of Watertown to follow a more southerly routing across the North Country. The Browns Corners‚ÄìRedwood portion of its former alignment was designated as NY 26B by the following year. It connected to its parent, NY 26, at its west end. On July 1, 1977, NY 26 was truncated southward to Carthage to eliminate of overlaps with other routes. All of NY 26's former routing north of Antwerp was renumbered to NY 283 while NY 26B was redesignated as NY 287.The NY 287 designation proved to be short-lived, however, as ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Jefferson County on August 1, 1979, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.

The Tipografia Elvetica was founded in 1830 by the Genoese exile Alessandro Repetti and directed by Gino Daelli. Thanks to its location on Swiss territory, close to the border with the Austrian-controlled Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, it rapidly became an important point of reference for the publication of patriotic works circulated clandestinely in Italy. =Collaborators and authors= The press enjoyed the collaboration of the Giuseppe Mazzinian Luigi Dottesio, who gave a notable impulse to the printing of books, periodicals and proclamations of Risorgimental patriots and exiles. The main authors published included Vincenzo Gioberti, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, Giuseppe La Farina, Niccol√≤ Tommaseo, Jean Charles Leonard Simonde de Sismondi, Friedrich Schiller, Pietro Colletta, Cesare Balbo and Massimo d'Azeglio. In 1851 Luigi Dottesio was arrested and executed by the Austrians. The growing attentions of the Swiss authorities, under Austrian pressure, forced Repetti to close down the Tipografia Elvetica in 1853.

By the 1970s, the Raine & Horne network stretched across Sydney, but driven by the enthusiasm of then chairman Max Raine, the Raine & Horne Board then decided to pursue a franchising business model, with its first franchised office opening in Liverpool, NSW in 1976.https://www.raineandhorne.com.au/our-history The Raine family has been continually involved with the firm since its inception in 1883, and Raine & Horne is now into its fourth generation of family ownership under current Executive chairman Angus Rainehttps://www.raineandhorne.com.au/our-team/angus-raine.

The organization is estimated to bring in between $500 million and $1 billion per year or more and may be involved in illegal activities, such as counterfeiting $100 bills, producing controlled substances (including the synthesis of methamphetamine and the conversion of morphine-containing opium into more potent opiates like heroin), and international insurance fraud. Although the seclusion of the North Korean state makes it difficult to evaluate this kind of information, many claim that Room 39 is critical to the Kim family's continued power, enabling them to buy political support and help fund North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Room 39 is the largest of three influential so-called Third Floor offices along with Office 35 tasked with intelligence and Office 38 which handles legal financial activities. Room 39 is believed to be located inside a ruling Workers' Party building in Pyongyang, not far from one of the North Korean leader's residences. All three Offices were initially housed on the third floor of the building where Kim Jong-il's office used to be, hence the moniker \\"Third Floor\\". History Room 39 was established by Kim Il-sung in the late 1970s. It has been described as the linchpin of the North's so- called \\"court economy\\" centered on the dynastic Kim family. According to Kim Kwang-jin, in 1972, Kim Jong-il created the central party department called \\"Office No. 39\\", which was named after the arbitrary office number where it began operations. Initially the Office was under the Finance and Accounting Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. In early 2010, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Kim Dong-un, head of the department, was replaced by his deputy, Jon Il-chun. The Chosun Ilbo reported that Room 38, led by Kim Jong-il, was merged into Room 39 in late 2009, but the two were split again in 2010 due to difficulties in obtaining foreign currency. Room 38 handles funds of the Kim family in legal businesses and acts as a front organization for Room 39. In July 2017, Chon Il-chun, first vice department director of the party's Central Committee and a former classmate of Kim Jong-il was leader of the office. Purpose and activities Room 39 is also involved in the management of foreign currency earnings from foreigners' hotels in Pyongyang, gold and zinc mining, and agricultural and fisheries exports. They are believed to run networks of illegal and legal companies that often change names. The number of companies -- at one point, reportedly up to 120 in number -- believed to be controlled by Room 39 include Zokwang Trading and Taesong Bank. Many of the $500 million worth of textiles North Korea exports each year have phony \\"made in China\\" labels attached to them and the wages of the estimated 50,000 North Korean workers sent abroad to work are reported to have added $500 million to $2 billion a year to Room 39's income. A 2007 report published by the Millennium Project of the World Federation of United Nations Associations said North Korea makes an estimated $500 million to $1 billion annually from illegal enterprises. Criminal operations reported to be run by Room 39 include trafficking fake US dollars, peddling bogus Viagra, exporting the recreational drug N-methylamphetamine and obtaining Russian oil using dealers in Singapore. At some point, transactions and trade by Office 39 reached 25 to 50% of the total of North Korea. In 2009, a Washington Post report outlined a global insurance fraud scheme by the North Korean government. The state-owned Korea National Insurance Corp (KNIC) sought reinsurance contracts with international reinsurers and then submitted fraudulent claims; the contracts were governed by North Korean law and legal challenges were fruitless. Document forgeries are also reported. Room 39 is also believed to be operating the overseas North Korean restaurant chain called Pyongyang. In 2015, the European Union placed the KNIC under sanctions and added that the KNIC had links to Office 39. The KNIC (which had offices in Hamburg, Germany and London, UK) was reported to have had assets of UK ¬£787 million in 2014 and had been involved in scamming insurance markets and making investments in property and foreign exchange. Thae Yong-ho, a North Korean diplomat who defected in 2016, said that North Korea earned each year \\"tens of millions of dollars\\" with insurance fraud. Ri Jong-ho was a senior official in the Room 39 organisation for about 30 years. He defected to South Korea in 2014 and to the United States in 2016. Ri was chairman of the Korea Kumgang Group that formed a joint venture with a Chinese businessman to run a taxi company in Pyongyang, the president of a North Korean shipping company and head of a Chinese branch of Daeheung, a North Korean trading company involved in seafood, coal, shipping and oil. In a 2017 newspaper article Ri described how he evaded sanctions by transferring cash from China to North Korea by ship and by train. A 2020 review by the National Intelligence Service found that the Korea Kaesong Koryo Insam Trading Corporation was likely a front for Room 39.

The attack The storming of the embassy on Wurtemberg Street, in the capital's embassy district about two kilometers east of Parliament Hill, began shortly before 7 a.m., when three militants in a rented moving truck arrived at the embassy gate. They scaled the security gate and began shooting at the bulletproof security hut. Security officer Claude Brunelle, a 31-year-old student from the University of Ottawa, was on duty. As soon as the attack began, Brunelle called in the emergency code and left the hut to confront the gunmen.

Earlier, in telephone conversations with reporters, they demanded, in exchange for releasing their hostages, that Turkey acknowledge the 1915 Armenian holocaust and \\"return Armenian lands confiscated by Turkey\\". The gunmen, who said they were members of the Armenian Revolutionary Army told Ottawa police they blasted their way into the Turkish embassy \\"to make Turkey pay for the Armenian genocide\\" of 1915. Background This was the third assault on Turkish diplomatic personnel in Ottawa by Armenian gunmen in three years: in April 1982, the embassy's commercial counsellor ‚Äì Kani G√ºng√∂r ‚Äì was shot and critically injured in a parking garage. The Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia quickly took credit for the attack, which left the attach√© paralyzed. Four months later, in August 1982, the embassy's military attach√© ‚Äì Col. Atilla Altƒ±kat ‚Äì was shot to death as he drove to work.

Pg 221 This need was ignored until the March 12, 1985, attack on the Turkish Embassy in Ottawa. The event changed the Canadian government's attitude toward militants and led to the creation of the RCMP Special Emergency Response Team. Claude Brunelle was awarded the Star of Courage for delaying the assailants long enough to allow the Turkish Ambassador to escape.

The village was submerged in the 1980s by the reservoir of the Salaulim Dam. Every year, at the peak of summer during April-May, parts of the submerged village rise above the water level for around one month. During this period, the original villagers come back to relive their memories and gather around their respective places of worship. Most of the villagers were rehabilitated to the nearby villages of Valkinim and Vaddem, and have since spread all across Goa. Location The village is located in Sanguem taluka, and is accessible by bike via the Curchorem-Ponda road. It is located approximately from Salaulim Dam's catchment area and has become a tourist destination when above the water level in May. History Curdi village in the early 1920s Kurdi was a prosperous agricultural village with a population of approximately 3,000. It had a main Hindu temple, smaller temples, a Christian chapel, and a Muslim shrine. In the 1960s, Dayanand Bandodkar, the then Chief Minister of Goa, decided to build the Salaulim dam to supply water to a large part of the state. Understanding that the villages of Curdi and Kurpem would be submerged by the reservoir, he offered the villagers rehabilitation in the nearby villages of Valkinim and Vaddem. The families were compensated with of agricultural land by the government. With all plans in place, the people of Curdi began moving out by 1971, making way for the construction of the dam by 1975. The reservoir submergence involved 20 villages which were partially or fully submerged. 3000 people (over 450 families) were displaced and resettled. The tall figure of Mother Goddess (dated to 5th century BC), a 16 tonne image, in the village was relocated to Verna. Another temple (dedicated to Mahadev), archaeologically dated to the 10th‚Äì11th century of the Kadamba period, at Curdi, Angod, was also relocated to a site away. The relocation was done by dismantling of the original temple and then reassembling it at the new location after methodically numbering each stone, over a period of 11 years. The village also has a long irrigation canal that was cut through laterite stone and is more than deep at most parts and winds its way through the religious structures. The canal's water was diverted by bunding it annually, until a man named Bosle built the permanent Bosle bund 150 years ago. Devabhag, Stristal, Karemal, Unan, Akrimal, Dhapode, Talsai and Kaman, among others, were the various smaller colonies of the village. Of these, Talsai and about half of Kurpem were not submerged by the reservoir. In 2017, the remains of a temple dedicated to Ganesha were discovered about away from the Shree Someshwar Temple. The temple's existence was not known as it was covered with thick vegetation before the submergence of the village. Aftermath In the initial days of relocation, the original inhabitants of Curdi village had to survive in rehabilitation homes provided by the government in the town of Vaddem. To date, they face problems with drinking water, irrigation, healthcare, employment, network coverage and electricity. This is partly due to the fact that the village does not receive water from the Salaulim Dam project. Annual gathering When parts of the submerged village appear above the water level during May, the original inhabitants go back with their families to picnic at the various standing structures of the village. They celebrate the feast of a chapel, which lies just above the water line on a hillock. The original villagers also celebrate the utsava of the Someshwar Temple in this village. A Muslim shrine is also present here. Documentary In 2016, young filmmaker Saumyananda Sahi chose to make a documentary about the village, after reading the thesis on the village written by Venisha Fernandes, whose family originally hails from the village. Fernandes chose her ancestral village as the subject for her dissertation as part of her Masters in Sociology at Goa University. Titled Remembering Kurdi, it is produced by the Films Division of India and has interviews of the original inhabitants interspersed with the scenery of the village when it is above the water level in May. It also has excerpts from a film shot at the village in 1977 by Vinay Dhumale, titled Gana Tapaswini. It features the Someshwar temple, the house of Mogubai Kurdikar, and village plantations. Sahi also organised a screening of the film for the original inhabitants living at Vaddem.

He used appropriate vintage instruments to orchestrate the story as the song evolves from a simple vocal melody to a blues song, a dance number, a hillbilly banjo piece, a country hit, and into the age of rock 'n' roll. His CD Carry the Word was named \\"Best CD of the Year 2000 by a Louisiana Artist\\" by The Times- Picayune of New Orleans, and he has won the New Orleans Gambit Weekly's \\"Big Easy Award for Best Folk Artist\\" several times.

Boland et al. 1992 page 292 Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus pilularis was first formally described in 1797 James Edward Smith in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The species name (pilularis) is a Latin word meaning \\"a small pill\\", referring to the shape of the fruit. Within the genus Eucalyptus, it lies in the subgenus Eucalyptus and the section Pseudophloius, a group united by rough but not stringy bark, large opposite juvenile and glossy green adult leaves. Their leaves have adensely reticulated pattern, and the seed is red-brown, and smooth and pyramidal in shape. A taxon once described as E. pilularis var. pyriformis has been reclassified as the species E. pyrocarpa. =Similar species= Blackbutt can be confused with Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita) or Sydney blue gum (E. saligna), but can be distinguished by the strong V-shape of the branch forks, which are preferred resting places for koalas.

North from Eden on the far south coast of New South Wales up to south eastern Queensland.Forest Trees of Australia, D.J. Boland et al. 1992 page 292 The latitudinal range is 37.5 to 25.5 degrees south of the equator. Usually seen at low to mid altitudes, though growing at above sea level near Wauchope, where it is a dominant species. Usually seen on coastal sandy loams, but also grows well on clays and volcanic soils. Reaches large size on drier slopes near rainforest. The rainfall range is between 900 mm and 2000 mm per year. The climate for much of the distribution range is warm and humid. The mean minimum of the coldest month is around 5 to 10 degrees C, and 24 to 32 degrees C for the hottest month mean temperature. Frosts may occur in some sites away from the coast and at higher altitude. Associated species Blackbutt grows with a large number of other tree types. In the higher quality forests, associate species include Sydney blue gum, tallowwood, white mahogany, grey ironbark, red mahogany, coast grey box, brush box and turpentine. In drier areas it grows with trees such as spotted gum, Angophora costata, Sydney peppermint and scribbly gum. Ecology Blackbutt forms an important element of the canopy of several endangered communities, including blue gum high forest, Illawarra lowlands, bangalay sand forest, and grassy woodland. Blackbutt leaves  Timber and forestry  60-metre tall blackbutt near New England National Park, Australia A significant commercial species, blackbutt is well regarded by foresters for the high quality of timber, easy regeneration and quick growth. Uses include making poles, railway sleepers, flooring, building framework, cladding, joinery, lining boards, furniture, woodchipping and decking. Wood density is about 900 kg per cubic metre. The sapwood is resistant to attack by lyctus borers, the heartwood is yellowish brown to light brown. Coarse textured, fairly straight grained, common small gum veins. Hard, strong, tough but not particularly difficult to work. Slow drying of mid to good levels of durability. Blackbutt timber is used in the flooring of Parliament House, Canberra.  Significant individuals  At Middle Brother National Park, there are two senescent individuals. Benaroon is 64 metres tall and 4.1 metres diameter at breast height. Bird Tree, nearby is 69 metres tall 3.59 metres diameter at breast height. An 85-metre tall blackbutt was felled near Bulli. Named in its honour The towns of Blackbutt, Benarkin in Queensland and the nearby Blackbutt Range are named after the Eucalyptus pilularis. There is also a nature reserve near Newcastle named Blackbutt Reserve, in New South Wales.http://www.newcastle.nsw.gov.au/recreation/blackbutt_reserve There is also the suburb of Blackbutt located in the Illawarra region on the South Coast of NSW, with the Blackbutt forest reserve being the largest natural bushland reserve in the illawarra.

Like deforestation in the rest of the world, it is a complex environmental issue caused by both social and economic pressures. Prior to the arrival of European-Americans, about one half of the United States land area was forest, about estimated in 1630. Recently, the Forest Service reported total forestation as in 2012.Forest Resources of the United States The majority of deforestation took place prior to 1910 with the Forest Service reporting the minimum forestation as around 1920. The forest resources of the United States have remained relatively constant through the 20th century. A 2017 study estimated 3 percent loss of forest between 1992-2001. The 2005 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global Forest Resources Assessment ranked the United States as seventh highest country losing its old growth forests, a vast majority of which were removed prior to the 20th century. After European colonization For the 300 years following the arrival of Europeans, land was cleared, mostly for agriculture, at a rate that matched that of population growth.'Collapse': How Societies choose to Fail or Succeed, The New York Times For every person added to the population, one to two hectares of land was cultivated.American Forest A History of Resiliency and Recovery United States Forest Service This trend continued until the 1920s when the amount of crop land stabilized in spite of continued population growth. As abandoned farm land reverted to forest the amount of forest land increased reaching a peak in 1963 of . After 1963 there was a gradual decrease through the next few decades which has been reversed with recovery and slight gains in the early 21st century. Gains in forest land have resulted from conversions from crop land and pastures at a higher rate than loss of forest to development.

One such factor is the effect, whether positive or negative, that the logging industry has on forests in the country. Logging in the United States is a hotly debated topic as groups who either support or oppose logging argue over its benefits and negative effects. \\"This industry comprises the establishments primarily engaged in one or more of the following: (1) cutting timber; (2) cutting and transporting timber; (3) producing wood chips in the field,‚Äù the definition provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.US EPA, \\"Forestry Facts and Figures\\". \\"The United States is the second leading producer and consumer of forest products and accounts for about one-fourth of the world‚Äôs production and consumption. The United States is also the world‚Äôs second-largest producer of softwood and hardwood lumber. In 1996, total annual sales for commercial (nonfederal) timber and nontimber forest products was approximately $3.8 billion.\\" The biggest issue thought to be facing deforestation in the United States is illegal logging in forests although facts prove otherwise from habitat and forest cover loss annually to catastrophic fire. More than 83 million acres have been lost to wildfire from 2005 to date.U.S. National Interagency Fire Center The United States Forest Service states that illegal logging is the biggest problem with deforestation because it is nearly impossible to monitor and stop. It goes on throughout the U.S. and other countries and often happens when companies disregard their permits and go beyond what they are allowed to harvest. The Forest Service and EPA work together to make sure that the permits for logging companies in the United States are granted in such a way that the forests are kept healthy and sustainable, and illegal logging reduces the chances that forests will be kept this way. The United States Forest Service is in favor of logging to a certain extent but there are several groups that oppose logging in the United States. Groups such as EarthRoots.org state that logging in the United States and specifically in industrial areas has led to deforestation and near extinction of many animals. =Species extinctions in the Eastern forests= Forest cover in the Eastern United States reached its lowest point in roughly 1872 with about 48 percent compared to the amount of forest cover in 1620. Of the 28 forest bird species with habitat exclusively in that forest, Pimm claims four become extinct either wholly or mostly because of habitat loss, the passenger pigeon, Carolina parakeet, ivory-billed woodpecker, and Bachman's warbler.

The term was coined by Paul F. Levy, a former Massachusetts state official, in an article in the Harvard Business Review published in 2001. The article outlines a situation which resulted in massive pollution of Boston Harbor, and proposes that the name of the facility involved be applied to similar situations in other business enterprises. The work is used as a source in human resources management case studies and is featured on the websites of several business management consulting firms and health care institutions. Description Levy served as executive director of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) from 1987 to 1992 before writing \\"The Nut Island Effect: When Good Teams Go Wrong\\", which describes conditions at the authority‚Äôs Nut Island sewage treatment facility in Quincy, Massachusetts, over a three decade period ending in the plant‚Äôs closure in 1997. The article uses the history of the facility to illustrate a five-step process that defines a business scenario that progressively leads to management-employee alienation, employee self-regulation of critical processes and finally catastrophic mission failure. In summary, the steps are:Levy, p. 8 * Management distraction and team autonomy - A climate exists where management is consumed by other issues and the team is a cohesive unit of highly motivated and skilled individuals who thrive on autonomy and avoid publicity. * Assumptions and resentment - Management assumes team self-sufficiency and begins to ignore requests for assistance, resulting in team resentment of management. * De facto separation - The team cohesiveness and resentment of management results in a full separation characterized by limited communication and complete refusal of outside assistance. * Self-rule - In order to satisfy external requirements the team creates self-imposed regulations which create hidden problems. * Chronic systemic failure and collapse - Management indifference and misguided team self-regulation become systemic, resulting in repeated failure and eventual catastrophic collapse. Background Position of Nut Island on the eastern shore of Quincy Bay with inset showing the location in Boston Harbor. Nut Island is a small roughly former island in Boston Harbor that was joined by landfill to the Hough's Neck peninsula in northeastern Quincy by the 1940s for use as the site of a sewage treatment facility. The operation of sewage treatment and disposal facilities in populous eastern Massachusetts was the responsibility of an independent state agency known as the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC). The commission, also responsible for the construction and maintenance of several roadways, recreational facilities such as swimming pools and hockey rinks and water distribution infrastructure, became known as fertile ground for political patronage in Massachusetts.Dolin, p. 63 As a result, top management became focused on the satisfaction of political goals and constituent recreation requests at the expense of mundane, less visible responsibilities including sewage treatment facilities operations. At the same time, following the ends of World War II and the Korean War the sewage treatment facility opened in 1952 at Nut Island was manned by several ex-servicemen. These men were by nature of their military experience both strongly inclined to build a powerfully cohesive unit possessing excellent improvisational skills and well suited to operating in isolation under adverse conditions.Levy, pp. 7-9 The management and employee situations satisfied the requirements of step one of Levy‚Äôs analysis. As time progressed management focused on political issues and became reliant on the quiet, consistent operation of the facility that the workers gladly provided. The plant staff found management to be so trusting and distracted as to provide little or no assistance in the resolution of problems. This resulted in the workers resenting the distant managers and creating a self-sustaining, self-regulating operation that often misreported situations and problems in an effort to both satisfy outside regulators and avoid management entirely. This environment led to staff reliance on unscientific treatment procedures and improvised unorthodox plant operation, primarily to avoid equipment replacement that required management approval. Eventually a series of plant failures culminated in a massive four-day discharge of untreated sewage in January 1976.Levy, pp. 9-11 =Cleanup Efforts= The failures at Nut Island and the companion Deer Island plant adjacent to Winthrop, Massachusetts, had far-reaching environmental and political effects. Fecal coliform bacteria levels forced frequent swimming prohibitions along the harbor beaches and the Charles River for many years. The City of Quincy sued the MDC and the separate Boston Water and Sewer Commission in 1982, charging unchecked systemic pollution of the city‚Äôs waterfront. That suit was followed by one by the Conservation Law Foundation and finally by the United States Government, resulting in a landmark court- ordered cleanup of Boston Harbor. The lawsuits forced then Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis to propose separating the water and sewer treatment divisions from the MDC, resulting in the creation of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in 1985. The slow progress of the cleanup became a central theme of the 1988 U.S. presidential election as George H.W. Bush defeated Dukakis partly through campaign speeches casting doubt on the governor‚Äôs environmental record, which Dukakis had claimed was better than that of Bush. The court-ordered cleanup continued throughout the next two decades and is still ongoing. Conclusions Levy became head of the MWRA in 1987 and presided over harbor cleanup and management reforms for the next four-and-a- half years. His experiences with those efforts and dialog with managers and employees at the time and in the following years led to publication of the paper. In the paper Levy provides a brief framework of recommendations for companies that wish to forestall or avert similar communication crises in their organizations. Among his proposed remedies are creation of links between employee actions and external controls with performance-based rewards, constant management presence and communication with remote operations centers and regular turnover of new employees at those centers.Levy, p. 10 The prominence of the Boston Harbor case has led to the paper being featured in human resources curriculums and as a training tool by business consulting firms.

It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, the east by the Atacama Region, and the south by the communes of Vicu√±a and La Serena. Punta de Choros is famous for its beaches and a colony of bottlenose dolphins, the southernmost colony of that species. Of the total commune population, 1,080 live in urban zones and 2,641 live in rural zones. The islands of Choros and Damas are also part of the commune, which form the National Reserve of the Humboldt Penguin, administered by the Corporaci√≥n Nacional Forestal. On the island of Damas, the beach La Tijera is found at the extreme south. Las Campanas Observatory and La Silla Observatory are also found in the territory of the commune.  History  The territory of La Higuera was well known historically for its mineral resources, and was greatly developed between 1855 and 1880. This encouraged immigration to the area, though when it got exhausted, many of them left. Today the slag piles visible in the northern part of the town of La Higuera are a reminder of this bygone era. There exist projects to install in the commune territory a modern thermal power station, with the idea of providing energy to the power grid that may be more reliable than hydroelectric power in times of drought. Despite the economic stimulus this would provide the commune, there are sectors of the population that oppose such an initiative due to the eventual environmental damage that it would cause. Another problem that has affected the commune is the scarcity of potable water, due to various factors, which has led to public complaints to the municipal as well as regional government. A fog collection project installed on El Tofo mountain in the 1990s to supply the village of Chugungo had fallen into disrepair as of 2002, and water was delivered to the village by truck, despite requests for construction of a water pipeline. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, La Higuera had 3,721 inhabitants (2,084 men and 1,637 women). Of these, 1,080 (29%) lived in urban areas and 2,641 (71%) in rural areas. The population grew by 6.4% (223 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The population of the commune is dispersed between a number of villages located throughout the commune. The predominant ones are Caleta Los Hornos, Chungungo, La Higuera (communal capital), El Trapiche, Punta Colorada, Los Choros and Punta de Choros. Town from hills above. On July 2nd, 2019 the town was in the path of the 2019 Total Solar Eclipse, see photo. Administration As a commune, La Higuera is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Sylvia Claver√≠a Mondaca. Within the electoral divisions of Chile, La Higuera is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Mario Bertolino (RN) and Marcelo D√≠az (PS) as part of the 7th electoral district, (together with La Serena Vicu√±a, Paiguano and Andacollo).

It requires the inclusion of facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists wherever a road, street or highway is being constructed or reconstructed and applies to the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) as well as Oregon cities and counties. The law requires that in any given fiscal year, a minimum of 1% of the state highway fund received by the ODOT, a city or county is used to provide walkways and bikeways located within the right-of-way of public roads, streets or highways open to motor vehicle traffic.  History  McCall signs the bill into law In 1971, Don Stathos, a Republican state representative and avid bicyclist from Jacksonville, sponsored House Bill 1700. Nine representatives and one state senator originally backed the bicycle bill. At each stage of the legislative process, the bill passed by one vote. Initially, Governor Tom McCall didn't favor the bill, but changed his mind as he came to believe it was good for Oregon and Oregonians. The governor signed the bill into law on the seat of a Schwinn Paramount. The bill allowed for the creation of the Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Committee, a governor-appointed committee that meets quarterly. The committee awards grants that provide approximately $5 million every two years for the design and construction of bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Grants are awarded to Oregon cities and counties through the ODOT Pedestrian and Bicycle Grant Program.

Behind the memorial on the right is city hall. The parking lot behind the memorial belongs to Cerritos High School The Cerritos Veterans Memorial, located in Cerritos, California is a sculpture dedicated in honor of local veterans. The sculpture is part of a \\"Cerritos Veterans Project,\\" which seeks to preserve the stories of veterans who are current or former residents of the City of Cerritos. The sculpture, which was designed and built by artist James T. Russell, sits on the grounds of the Cerritos Civic Center. The memorial The memorial was dedicated at the first annual Veterans Day ceremony on November 11, 2006. The memorial contains a stainless steel sculpture in the shape of a flame atop a reflecting pool. There are five pedestals surrounding the pool, each containing the emblem of one branch of the United States armed forces: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and the Coast Guard. Off to the side, there are two other pedestals, one in honor of the Merchant Marine, and another honoring all 32 groups who were recognized by Congress for their efforts during World War I and World War II. The memorial serves as a focal point for the various official city ceremonies which have a patriotic theme. The dedication ceremony in 2006 served as the city's first annual Veterans Day ceremony, and the first annual Memorial Day ceremony took place in 2008.There was a small private Memorial Day ceremony at the memorial in 2007, which served as the seed for the official ceremonies which started in 2008 Starting in 2007, the city also moved its Let Freedom Ring ceremony to celebrate the Fourth of July to the grounds around the Cerritos Veterans Memorial,Prior to 2007, the ceremony took place at Cerritos Park East and in 2010 the city held its Patriot Day concert in that venue. Controversies =Memorial design= Pedestals honoring the Merchant Marine and other groups who contributed to the war efforts. These pedestals are in the vicinity, but not part of the sculpture. During the November 22, 2005, Cerritos City Council meeting, a controversy erupted as to whether there should be a sixth pedestal around the pool with the emblem of the Merchant Marine. After a very long public discussion, a compromise was reached where it was decided to put a pedestal with the emblem of the Merchant Marine, but place that pedestal off to the side and not include it with the emblems of the 5 primary branches. In order to be sensitive to other groups, it was also decided to have a pedestal honoring all the groups recognized by Congress for the contributions during World War I and World War II.

He is seen as a prominent figure in the Italian Risorgimento. Life Carlo Ilarione Petitti di Roreto was born in Turin on 21 October 1790, son of the count Giuseppe Antonio Petitti di Roreto (1729‚Äì1795) and of the noblewoman Innocenza Gabriella Ferrero di Ponziglione e Borgo d'Ales (1767‚Äì1797). In 1813 at Alessandria he married the noblewoman Maria Teresa Gabriella Genna of the counts of Cocconato (1791‚Äì1826); the marriage produced four children: Alessandro (1813‚Äì1841), Agostino (1814‚Äì1890), Maurizio (1816‚Äì1852), and Giuseppe (1824‚Äì1886). After graduating in law from the University of Genoa in 1816, he entered the administration of the Kingdom of Sardinia, for which he had already worked on an unpaid basis, becoming vice- intendant general of Savoy at Chamb√©ry. In 1819 he was made intendant general of Asti and in 1826 of Cuneo. In 1831 he was appointed to the newly founded Council of State, an institution whose creation he had promoted to the king; in 1836 he became vice-president of the higher commission of statistics, also established by Charles Albert of Savoy, and in 1839 he was appointed to the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino. In 1842 he was a founder member, along with Cavour, of the Associazione Agraria di Torino. He was identified by Metternich, together with Vincenzo Gioberti, Massimo d'Azeglio and Cesare Balbo as one of the most eminent Piedmontese Liberals of the time and is regarded as one of the leading intellectuals in the cultural and political spheres of the Risogimento and was described by Gian Mario Bravo as one of the few who emerged not so much because of their aristocratic titles or through their political activities (though both did apply in his case), but above all because of his work as an academic, as an economist, and as a commentator and journalist. Thus he came to be considered by many as the major inspirer of the Albertine reform programme. His 1845 essay on the advantages to be gained by the development of railways received great attention in political circles both at home and abroad. In 1848 he was made a senator of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Carlo Ilarione Petitti died two years later, on 10 April 1850, in Turin. His death was brought about by podagra, a painful disease from which he had suffered for many years.

His direct reporting style in his column Red Privada (\\"Private Network\\"), which publicly exposed government and law enforcement corruption, organized crime, and drug trafficking, was distributed and read in over 200 newspapers across Mexico. Born in the state of Michoac√°n, Buend√≠a first wrote for La Naci√≥n, the official magazine of the National Action Party (PAN). After losing interest in the party, he left to work for La Prensa and became the editor-in-chief in 1960. He left the newspaper in 1963 and worked for several different media outlets in Mexico throughout the 1970s and '80s, including the Mexico City-based newspapers El Universal and Exc√©lsior. Buend√≠a was recognized largely for his investigative reporting, and particularly for his coverage of the CIA's covert operations in Mexico, the rise of ultra-rightwing groups, fraudulent businessmen, corruption in Mexico's state-owned petroleum company Pemex, and the role of organized crime in Mexico's political system. He was also famous for breaking news on controversial political subjects thanks to his access to top Mexican officials. His investigative reporting, however, angered many and made him a frequent target of death threats, which he took very seriously. On the afternoon of 30 May 1984, Buend√≠a left his office in Mexico City and was walking to his car when a man shot him from behind several times, killing him on the scene. For over five years, the murder case remained unsolved and with several irregularities, including the loss of evidence. In 1989, several members of the extinct Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's top police force, were arrested for their involvement in the murder of Buend√≠a. The murder case was closed after the perpetrators were arrested, but several journalists doubt the probe's results and believe that the masterminds behind Buend√≠a's murder were never arrested. Early life Manuel Buend√≠a Tellezgir√≥n was born in Zit√°cuaro, Michoac√°n, Mexico on 24 March 1926. He was the third child of Jos√© Buend√≠a G√°lvez (father) and Josefina Tellezgir√≥n Tinoco (mother), both from the State of Mexico. Buend√≠a attended a religious elementary school located in front of Teatro Ju√°rez de Zit√°cuaro, a former theatre in his hometown. At the age of 12, his parents moved to Morelia, Michoac√°n and enrolled him at Seminario Menor, where he studied for three years. As a teenager, Buend√≠a contributed to La Naci√≥n, a magazine of the National Action Party (PAN). Though he sympathized with the PAN during his early life, Buend√≠a later lost interest in the party. His mother died of natural causes on 21 June 1941, and Buend√≠a returned to Zit√°cuaro. After a few years, he was awarded a scholarship at Instituto Patria, a Jesuit high school in Mexico City. Upon graduation he attended the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a private Law school in Mexico City, but dropped out to take care of his family following the death of his father in 1945. Journalism career From 1949 to 1953, Buend√≠a worked for La Naci√≥n and met the magazine's secretary Dolores Abalos Lebrija, whom he married on 19 January 1955. Though he first wrote for La Naci√≥n, his professional journalistic career began at the newspaper La Prensa in 1953. He worked as an editor, crime reporter, and political columnist for the newspaper until he became the editor-in-chief in January 1960. Around that time Buend√≠a started his daily column Red Privada (\\"Private Network\\"), where he wrote about the alleged collusion of organized crime in Mexico's political system. In 1963, he left to work at the newspaper El D√≠a and wrote at the political column Para Control de Usted (\\"For You to Control\\") under the penname \\"J.M. Tellezgir√≥n\\". From 1964 to 1965, Buend√≠a directed the weekly Crucero and wrote the column Concierto Pol√≠tico (\\"Political Concert\\") under the penname \\"D. I. Ogenes\\". On 1 January 1971, he was appointed as the head of the Press and Public Relations of Mexico City alongside Alfonso Mart√≠nez Dom√≠nguez. However, Buend√≠a turned down the position in June following the massacre of student demonstrators. A year later, Buend√≠a worked as an advisor to Guillermo Mart√≠nez Dom√≠nguez, the former head of Nacional Financiera, a bank of Mexico's Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP). In Nacional Financiera, Buend√≠a befriended Gerardo Bueno Zir√≥n, who shortly after being appointed as director of the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) offered him a position as director of the institution's Press and Public Relations department in 1973. That year, Henrique Gonz√°lez Casanova, the former head of the Political Science department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), invited Buend√≠a to work as a part-time professor, a job that the journalist held until his death in 1984. On December 1976 Buend√≠a left his post in CONACYT to become a full-time columnist. He then worked at El Sol de M√©xico, a newspaper owned by Organizacion Editorial Mexicana. After facing some differences with the owners of the print media company, Buend√≠a left on 17 August 1978 to work at El Universal, a newspaper based in Mexico City. Only lasting until December of that year, he left to work at Exc√©lsior, a daily newspaper with one of the largest circulations in Mexico City. At this newspaper, Buend√≠a wrote for the column Red Privada, which was distributed and read in over 200 newspaper across Mexico. In his column he wrote about the covert operations of the CIA in Mexico during the Cold War, ultra-rightwing groups, crooked businessmen, and corrupt government officials involved in drug trafficking. His investigations angered many in Mexico's political elite and made him a frequent target of death threats. Buend√≠a took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buend√≠a wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge D√≠az Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, the former head of Mexico City's police force. Buend√≠a also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buend√≠a's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of the second half of the 20th century. Death On Wednesday, 30 May 1984, Buend√≠a left his offices in Colonia Ju√°rez at around 6:30 p.m. and headed towards his car in a parking lot near Insurgentes Avenue at the Zona Rosa neighborhood in Mexico City. As he got closer to his car, a tall man wearing jeans, a black jacket, and a baseball cap approached him from behind and violently grabbed his coat before shooting him four times with a .38 Super. Buend√≠a was carrying a handgun on his waist but he was not able to defend himself at the moment of his death. After killing him, the assailant fled on a motorcycle with another man. There were several bystanders who witnessed the murder and managed to see the faces of the assassins, including Juan Manuel Bautista, a colleague of Buend√≠a; Rogelio Barrera Galindo, a man who had parked his vehicle close to the journalist's; and Felipe Flores Fern√°ndez, a bus driver. Among the first to arrive at the murder scene was Jos√© Antonio Zorrilla P√©rez, then-head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS), Mexico's equivalent of the FBI, and one of Buend√≠a's main sources for his political publications. Photos of Buend√≠a's corpse circulated across Mexico and the rest of the world. Suspicions first fell on Los Tecos (\\"The Owls\\"), an ultra-rightwing group of the Autonomous University of Guadalajara who were largely criticized by Buend√≠a for terrorizing their campus. However, suspicions turned to drug traffickers and high-level government officials, specifically those of the DFS. According to local media reports, once Buend√≠a was killed, DFS agents went into the columnist's office and stole several files. =Investigation= The murder of Buend√≠a, alongside the killing of other journalists in Mexico that year, sent a chilling message to newspapers across the country. \\"The bullets that killed Manuel Buendia ... were not directed at one man but at freedom of expression,\\" read Excelsior's front page on the day after the killing. The killing was immediately condemned by the administration of President Miguel de la Madrid, who promised to bring the perpetrators to justice through a thorough investigation. However, the investigation dragged for over five years with no arrests and several inconsistencies, including the loss of evidence. On 11 June 1989, Zorrilla P√©rez himself was charged with planning the murder; Juan Rafael Moro √Åvila, also a DFS agent and great-grandnephew of former President Manuel √Åvila Camacho, was charged of being a co-perpetrator with Jos√© Luis Ochoa Alonso (alias El Chocorrol), who shot Buend√≠a at point-blank. Another hypothesis was that Moro was only responsible for driving the motorcycle used by the real assassin, Juan Ar√©valo Gardoqui, then Secretariat of National Defense, to escape. Three other DFS agents were also arrested: Juventino Prado Hurtado, Ra√∫l P√©rez Carmona and Sof√≠a Naya. At least two main suspects, Jos√© Luis Ochoa Alonso and Juan Ar√©valo Gardoqui, were reported murdered in unclear circumstances before being formally charged. The perpetrators were apprehended in 1989 under the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving at least half of their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.

History Lannock Mill was built in 1860. A windmill had previously been shown on Warburton's map dated 1720 and Thomas Kitchin's map dated 1749. The mill was built by Richard Christy, who worked it until his son Richard took over in 1868. In 1882, Richard Christy Jr emigrated to America and the mill was taken over by Thomas Sanderson. He installed a steam engine as auxiliary power. The mill was badly damaged in a storm in the late 1880s. Repairs including new sails and cap were carried out by Course's, the Biggleswade millwrights. The steam engine was eventually replaced by a gas engine. The mill was working by wind into the early 1920s and by engine until 1929. The mill was stripped of machinery over the years, leaving the empty tower standing today. Description Lannock Mill is a five storey tower mill. The tower is internal diameter at the base with walls thick. It is diameter at curb level with walls thick. The tower is to the curb. The mill stood over high to the top of the cap finial. It had an ogee cap winded by an eight bladed fantail. There were four Single Patent sails. The mill drove four pairs of millstones. The great spur wheel was of cast iron.

Their line up consists of vocalist/guitarist Matt Joe Gow, guitarist Andrew Pollock, bassist Cameron Grindrod, keyboardist Clio Renner and drummer Joel Witenberg. The band is based in Melbourne, Australia, although Joe Gow is from New Zealand. The group initially formed to serve as a backing band on Matt Joe Gow's solo album The Messenger, released through Liberation Music in July 2009. Produced by Nash Chambers, the album features instrumental contributions from Jim Moginie and Bill Chambers. The first single off the album, \\"Come What May\\" received some international airplay. The Messenger is, however, considered by the band as predominately a solo work. The group's 2012 album Cities on the Sea (released in February 2012, produced by Scott Horscroft and Eric J Dubowsky) was regarded as their first official album. The album marks a change in direction from the solo material and features guest vocals from Emma Louise and Gin Wigmore. In 2014 the band entered an indefinite hiatus with Matt Joe Gow focusing on his solo work alongside Pollock, Clio Renner also focusing on her solo work and Joel Witenberg forming New York based indie band 'Surf Rock Is Dead'.

Eurocentral factory Eurocentral was the name given to a former factory near Holytown operated by the Taiwanese television parts manufacturer Chunghwa Picture Tubes (‰∏≠ËèØÊò†ÁÆ°). The building is sometimes referred to as The Chunghwa Factory, and is locally infamous because it was built using large amounts of taxpayers‚Äô money but was demolished within 10 years. Originally designed as a factory to produce cathode ray tubes for use in television sets and monitors, the rapid rise in popularity of LCD and plasma televisions contributed to the huge losses made by the Chunghwa company. It is also reported that a huge water bill from West of Scotland Water also helped contribute to the eventual demise of the site. Opening in 1996 the factory was expected to create 3,000 local jobs. However employment never rose above 1,200 and the factory was empty by 2003. The company was forced to repay ¬£8 million of the ¬£20 million it received from the government. The factory was demolished and the site developed into a mixed use commercial and business park.

The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of thirteen to nineteen or more on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum. Flowering occurs in summer and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, spherical glaucous capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed below the rim.A Field Guide to Eucalypts - Brooker & Kleinig volume 1, . Page 94. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus stenostoma was first formally described in 1972 by Lawrie Johnson and Donald Blaxell in Contributions from the New South Wales Herbarium. The type specimens were collected in 1965 by David John Hynd (born 1937), near the head of the Tuross River north-west of Nerrigundah. The specific epithet (stenostoma) is from ancient Greek words meaning \\"narrow\\" and \\"opening\\", referring to the opening of the fruit. Distribution and habitat Jillaga Ash grows only in the catchment areas of the Tuross and Deua Rivers, in steeply sloping dry woodland on relatively infertile soils.

H. alvei is a commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and not normally pathogenic, but may cause disease in immunocompromised patients. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including the aminopenicillins. The name comes from Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen. Hafnia alvei is used as a lactic ferment by the dairy industry and more recently as a probiotic included in a dietary supplement product.  History  The genus Hafnia is one of more than 40 genera that currently comprise the order Enterobacterales. Although M√∏ller originally described this genus in 1954, the legitimacy of this group was constantly challenged over the next two decades, often being referred to by synonyms such as \\"Enterobacter alvei\\", \\"Enterobacter aerogenes subsp. hafniae\\" and \\"Enterobacter hafniae\\" but it is mostly referenced by its current name, Hafnia alvei, in the literature. In 1977, a study concluded that at the end of Camembert manufacturing Hafnia alvei remains as the dominant species. Hafnia alvei is a psychrotrophic strain, which can develop at low temperatures, meaning that it doesn't stop growing during the storage phase of cheese unlike E. coli. In 1983, Enterobacterales were discovered in freshly produced Camembert: 51% of the identified Enterobacterales were Hafnia alvei strains compared to only 9% of Escherichia coli. These authors also showed that Hafnia alvei grew to a high concentration in cheese (up to 107 CFU/g), in both raw milk and pasteurised milk cheeses. A few years later, in 1987, Hafnia alvei was identified by a Spanish team in raw ewes‚Äô milk representing 6.5% of the total Enterobacterales species present. In 2014, a collaborative study working on cheese ripening, involving the French INRA and an Italian University, identified H. alvei in raw milk used to make the traditional Caciocavallo Pugliese Cheese. Hafnia alvei is also present in fermented foods other than dairy products, it has been identified over the years in traditional meals around the planet. In 1987, American scientists studying Brassicaceae found Hafnia alvei while analysing the microflora of fresh harvested collards, they believed the Hafnia alvei originated from soil contamination but not necessarily as a pathogen. Hafnia has also been identified in fermented coffee seeds in Ethiopia and Ohio, USA. American researchers studied the microbiome of the coffee seeds and identified Hafnia alvei among numerous other strains and species, including 13 species of Enterobacterales. This study highlighted that the richness of the seeds‚Äô microbiome was linked to the fermentation process and the coffee quality. The richest order of bacteria identified was the Enterobacterales containing Hafnia alvei. This family is often found in humid and nutrient rich environments similar to coffee processing conditions. Thus, they could play a critical role in the fermentation. Hafnia alvei was also been identified in commercial Kimchi, a traditional Korean meal made with Asian cabbage, radish, spices and salted fermented seafood. Scientists suggest the source of Hafnia in this case is the fermented seafood. In 2004, Mexican scientists isolated Hafnia alvei (among other bacteria such as Lactobacillus acidophilus or plantarum) from Pulque a traditional beverage made from fermented Maguey (also known as Agave). And finally, Hafnia alvei was also isolated from meat products, particularly refrigerated beef due to the presence of Hafnia alvei on slaughtered cattle. It can be found alongside E. Coli in Chorizo, a popular semi-dry fermented Spanish sausage. Fermented sausages made in Spain were also reported to contain the Hafnia alvei strain, responsible for producing histamine that is crucial to the ripening process.  Commensal strain  Most standard microbiology texts list mammals, birds, reptiles, Ô¨Åsh, soil, water, sewage, and foods as sources from which hafniae can be recovered. The gastrointestinal tracts of animals, and in particular mammals, appear to be a very common ecologic habitat for hafniae. Paleomicrobiology investigations have identiÔ¨Åed H. alvei originating from intestinal mass samples and sediment collected from 12,000-year-old mastodon remains in Michigan and Ohio. In a study of 642 Australian mammals, Gordon and FitzGibbon found that H. alvei was the third most common enteric species identiÔ¨Åed, following Escherichia coli and E. cloacae. The isolation of H. alvei was signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with recovery from marsupial carnivores and murid rodents. Hafniae have also been recovered sporadically from the manure samples of pack animals collected from national park trails and from 7% of the grizzly and black bear specimens tested. Among avian species, H. alvei has been frequently isolated from birds of prey, including falcons, owls, and turkey vultures; even high-altitude alpine accentors that have virtually no contact with humans have had Hafnia isolated from them, at frequencies ranging from 3% to 16%. Other sources for H. alvei include reptiles (snakes and skinks), invertebrates, insects, Ô¨Åsh, and bats.  Role of H. alvei in cheese ripening  According to several publications, Hafnia alvei is present as a dominant species during the ripening of raw milk cheese. Hafnia alvei is a psychrotrophic bacterium, it originates in raw milk and continues to grow in cheeses such as Camembert. The multiplication is a key factor in the fermentation process and ripening of cheese. Since 1979, studies of French cheese have led to the identification of correlations between Hafnia alvei growth and chemical parameters during cheese manufacturing. Several researchers estimated that the level of H. alvei reaches 107 CFU/g at the end of ripening process and showed that its growth curve is closely linked to an increase in pH. Similarly, Mounier et al. determined a H. alvei content of about 109 CFU/g in a model smear cheese (soft cheese). Extensive study of traditional cheeses that have been consumed for years highlight the presence of Hafnia alvei in dairy products for more than thirty years. In conclusion, abundant levels of Hafnia alvei can be found in raw milk cheese and it plays a large role in cheese aromatisation due to its impact on acidity and capacity to produce free amino-acids. Hafnia is either intentionally added during the cheesemaking process or it is already present as a constituent of the milk microflora. It contributes to the fermentation process and ripening of cheeses. Metabolic studies revealed that H. alvei is pivotal to the ripening process and the development of the typical cheese flavour. Because of these properties affecting acidity and flavour, H. alvei has been used in the manufacture of several cheeses, such as cheddar, gouda and camembert, as well as in Livarot and other raw milk cheese. H. alvei is also marketed in the EU as a ripening culture for camembert with a strong aroma (Aroma-Prox AF 036, provided by Bioprox SAS, France) or as blend of microorganisms for soft cheese flavour (Choozit‚Ñ¢ Cheese cultures ARO 21-HA LYO 10 D, provided by Danisco Denmark). A 2013 study of a cheese model ecosystem highlighted the role of Hafnia alvei in inhibiting the growth of E. coli strain O26:H11 without altering pH or lactic acid concentrations. Hafnia alvei did produce a small amount of biogenic amines such as putrescine and cadaverine but these didn't affect the overall level of volatile aroma compounds. Interest in Hafnia alvei‚Äôs roll in cheese making is increasing. A 2007, ANR (French National Research Agency) project (GRAMME) are evaluating the benefits and risks of Hafnia alvei in the production of cheese and studying the potential functions to enlarge its application to other food products.  Culture growth  Hafnia grows in media containing 2% to 5% NaCl, a pH range of 4.9 to 8.25, and thermal gradients of 4 ¬∞C to 44 ¬∞C; the optimum temperature for growth has been reported as 35 ¬∞C. There is general agreement that almost 100% of Hafnia strains grow on MacConkey, Hektoen enteric, eosin methylene blue, and xylose-lysine-deoxycholate agars, all of which are differential to moderately selective media. On more inhibitory selective media, 25% to 60% of strains fail to grow on Salmonella-Shigella (SS) agar, while 75% to 100% of isolates are inhibited on brilliant green medium. Classic strains of H. alvei are lactose and sucrose negative and as such appear as nonfermenting colonies on enteric isolation media. On moderately selective agars, they typically appear as large, smooth, convex, translucent colonies of 2 to 3 mm in diameter with an entire edge; some may exhibit an irregular border.  Biology  = Lipopolysaccharides = The immunochemistry of Hafnia lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are extremely complicated. All H. alvei LPS appear to contain glucose, glucosamine, heptose, and 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid. Some LPS also contain other amino sugars or carbohydrates such as mannose, galactose, galactosamine, and mannosamine. The core oligosaccharide structure of some strains consists of an identical hexasaccharide structure composed of two D-glucose residues, three LD-heptose residues, and one 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid residue. There is extensive serologic and immunologic diversity in this genus, and active research continues in this area. = Biotypes = In 1969, Barbe described two biotypes of H. alvei based upon fermentation of D-arabinose and salicin and on esculin and arbutin hydrolysis. One challenge that microbiologists face is trying to develop biochemical tests that can readily distinguish most strains of DNA group 1 (H. alvei sensu stricto) from DNA group 2 (unnamed Hafnia species) isolates. These two groups could be distinguished from one another by a series of tests. No single test was completely discriminatory, but motility at 24hr was the best predictor of DNA group (DNA group 1, 9% positive; DNA group 2, 100% positive).  Pathogenicity and antimicrobial susceptibility  There is limited information about the pathogenicity of Hafnia alvei. Although this pathogen was recovered in large numbers from feces, the joint fluid, blood, and urine were culture negative; the role of hafniae in this illness is debatable (From soup to nuts). This is likely due to the low occurrence frequency of this species in human illnesses and the fact that there are no clear-cut disease syndromes speciÔ¨Åcally associated with H. alvei. The current information regarding Hafnia pathogenicity can be looked at from two perspectives; virulence factors potentially operative in extra intestinal infections and those restricted primarily to the intestin. A study mentions that mice injected intraperitoneally with hafniae did not succumb to infection. H. alvei is an uncommon human pathogen despite the increased attention from the medical community over the past decade due to its possible association with gastroenteritis. There are no well-described outbreaks of disease caused by H. alvei in which the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory correlates are overwhelmingly in support of an unquestionable role for hafniae in these illnesses. In a study of 17 Hafnia alvei (\\"Enterobacter hafniae\\") isolates recovered by the Mayo Clinic from 1968 to 1970, only 5 isolates (29%) were judged to be clinically signiÔ¨Åcant. In all Ô¨Åve of these cases, H. alvei was determined to be a secondary pathogen (respiratory:2; abscess:3). Overall, the mean age of those infected or colonised with H. alvei was 52.9 years, with a male/female ratio of 1:1.1. Slightly over 50% of all isolates were acquired via a nosocomial route, including all Ô¨Åve associated with infection. In only two instances was H. alvei recovered in pure culture, and in neither case was the strain clinically signiÔ¨Åcant. It is interesting to highlight that ATCC considers that all Hafnia alvei strains belong to the Biosafety level 1 only. Furthermore, Richard identified the presence of 108 viable cells per gram of cheese, which suggests a daily consumption of more than 109 bacteria per day (calculation based on a 30 g portion) indicating the good safety profile of Hafnia alvei in daily consumption. The safety of Hafnia alvei in immunocompetent patients looks very clear and have been demonstrated for more than 4 decades up to now. Stock et al. describes a study in which 76 H. alvei isolates were investigated for their susceptibility to 69 antibiotics or drugs. The general pattern that emerges from this study is that hafniae are typically susceptible to carbapenems, monobactams, chloramphenicol, quinolones, aminoglycosides, and antifolates (e.g., trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole) and resistant to penicillin, oxacillin, and amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. Susceptibility to tetracyclines and cephalosporins is variable. A Spanish study, involving enteric pathogens also found that 32 strains of H. alvei were universally susceptible to all quinolones (including gemifloxacin and grepafloxacin), cefotaxime, gentamicin, co-trimoxazole, and naladixic acid; 78% of the strains in that study were susceptible to doxycycline. Some H. alvei strains produce both low-level inducible cephalosporinases (ceftazidime susceptible) and high-level constitutive cephalosporinase activity that is resistant to ceftazidime.  Health Benefits  Hafnia produces a protein called Caseinolytic Protease B (ClpB) which has been shown to be a mimetic of the hormone Œ±-MSH which is implicated in the satiety. Some Enterobacterales bacteria, such as Hafnia alvei have been shown to naturally regulate the appetite.  Regulatory status  Hafnia alvei is a food grade bacteria. It is not listed in the Novel Food catalogue of the European Commission. It is listed on the Danish list of notified microbial cultures applied in food. Hafnia alvei is part of the IDF positive list (International Dairy Federation) of Microbial Food Cultures (MFC) demonstrating safety requirements in fermented food products for worldwide use.

The Worlds of Christopher Columbus, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p. 133 Although not a formal agreement, the capitulations resulted from negotiation. When Columbus's proposal was initially rejected, Queen Isabella convoked another assembly, made up from sailors, philosophers, astrologers and others to reexamine the project. The experts considered absurd the distances between Spain and the Indies that Columbus calculated. The monarchs also became doubting, but a group of influential courtiers convinced them that they would lose little if the project failed and would gain much if it succeeded. Among those advisors were the archbishop of Toledo Hernando de Talavera, the notary Luis de Sant√°ngel and the chamberlain Juan Cabrero. The royal secretary Juan II Coloma was ordered to formulate the capitulations. The agreement took three months to prepare because the monarchs were busy with other matters.Mary L. Eckhart. Columbus' Dictionary, Branden Books, 1992, p. 9 The capitulations were sealed at the Santa Fe encampment, which had been built on the outskirts of Granada as a military base of operations during the city's siege. The original version has not survived. The earliest surviving copy is contained in the confirmations issued by the Crown in Barcelona in 1493. The omission of the word 'Asia' has led some historians to suggest that Columbus never intended to go there, but only to discover the new lands.

General features An SCS bus is based on a sheathed twisted pair formed of two flexible conductors; these are braided and unshielded with isolation 300/500V, SELV as double isolation is required ‚Äì according to the rules adopted by CEI (International Electrotechnical Committee). The bus is unpolarized, devices are required to support the DC power supply in both polarity. =Wiring= Two kind of wiring are possible: *Free cabling were a mix of bus and star topology are present, better for old houses *Star wiring were all devices are connected to the switch rack, better for new houses =Communication= Across the SCS bus four different types of signals are transmitted in frequency modulation: * Electricity supply via 27 Vdc * Data with a frequency clock of 9600 Hz * Sound * Video The transmission protocol is the CSMA/CA. =Functions= Through the SCS bus you have the following functions: * Light control * Automation * Sound diffusion * Energy management * Thermoregulation * Video intercom * Alarm system All the listed functions share the same technology and the same procedures for configuration / installation. =Configuration= All devices connected to SCS bus must be manually configured, no autolearn is possible, apart Alarm system and extenders.

It is a direct sequel to 2005's Battlefield 2, and the eleventh installment in the Battlefield franchise. The game was released in North America on 25 October 2011 and in Europe on 28 October 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. In Battlefield 3s campaign, players take on the personas of several military roles: a U.S. Marine, an F/A-18F Super Hornet weapon systems officer, an M1A2 Abrams tank operator, and a Spetsnaz GRU operative. The campaign takes place in various locations and follows the stories of two characters, Henry Blackburn and Dimitri Mayakovsky. The game sold 5 million copies in its first week of release, and received mostly positive reviews. The game's sequel, Battlefield 4, was released in 2013. Gameplay Dima\\" is armed with a G36Calt=left Battlefield 3 features the combined arms battles across single-player, co- operative and multiplayer modes. It reintroduces several elements absent from the Bad Company games, including fighter jets, the prone position and 64-player battles on PC. To accommodate the lower player count on consoles, the ground area is limited for Xbox 360 and PS3, though fly space remains the same. The game features maps set in Paris, Tehran (as well as other locations in Iran), Sulaymaniyah in Iraq, New York City, Wake Island, Oman, Kuwait City, and other parts of the Persian Gulf. The maps cover urban streets, metropolitan downtown areas, and open landscapes suited to vehicle combat. Battlefield 3 introduces the \\"Battlelog\\"; a free cross-platform social service with built-in text messaging, voice communications, game statistics, and the ability to join games that friends are already playing (though both players need to be on the same platform). =Cooperative= A demo featuring the new co-op mode was featured at gamescom 2011. Split screen is not available. Battlefield 3s new Battlelog social network, DICE noted, would be tied to all co-op matches, allowing players to try to beat friends' scores and to track their performance. Participating in co-op mode allows the player to collect points that unlock additional content that can be used in multiplayer. =Multiplayer= Screenshot of the HUD as shown in the fighter jet in multiplayer mode Battlefield 3s multiplayer matches see players take on one of four roles: Assault, Support, Engineer and Recon. The Assault class focuses on assault rifles and healing teammates. The Support class focuses on light machine guns and supplying ammunition. The Engineer class focuses on supporting and destroying vehicles. The Recon class focuses on sniping and spotting enemies. The mechanics of the weapons have been changed to utilize the new engine: compatible weapons may have bipods attached which can then be deployed when in the prone position or near suitable scenery, and provide a significant boost to accuracy and recoil reduction. Suppressive fire from weapons blurs the vision and reduces the accuracy of those under fire, as well as health regeneration. The Recon class can put a radio beacon anywhere on the map and all squad members will be able to spawn on the location of the beacon. Several game modes are present, including Conquest, Rush, Squad Deathmatch, Squad Rush and for the first time since Battlefield 1942, Team Deathmatch. However, more game modes are available through the purchase of extra downloadable content packs. The PC version of Battlefield 3 is by default launched via a web browser from the Battlelog web site. A server browser is present in console versions of the game. Synopsis =Setting and characters= Battlefield 3s Campaign story is set during the fictional \\"War of 2014\\" and covers events that occur over the span of nine months. Most of the story takes place in the Iran‚ÄìIraq region. Other locations include the Iranian-Azerbaijani border, Paris, and New York City. Most missions occur as flashbacks on part of the interrogation of Sergeant Henry Blackburn, and do not occur in order of events.Battlefield 3 The Campaign puts the player in control of four different player characters. For most of the story, the player controls Sergeant Henry \\"Black\\" Blackburn (portrayed by Gideon Emery), a member of the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Recon Battalion and main protagonist. The player also controls Sgt. Jonathan \\"Jono\\" Miller, a M1 Abrams tank operator deployed in Tehran; Lt. Jennifer \\"Wedge\\" Colby Hawkins, an F/A-18F Super Hornet weapon systems officer; and Dimitri \\"Dima\\" Mayakovsky, a Russian GRU operative. The main antagonist, Solomon, is an overseas asset for the Central Intelligence Agency. Non-player characters include: Misfit 1, Blackburn's squad (including David Montes, Steve Campo, Christian Matkovic, and Cpt. Quinton Cole); Dima's GRU squadmates Vladimir and Kiril; and CIA Agents Gordon and Whistler, who interrogate Blackburn for much of the Campaign. =Plot= On 15 March 2014, Sgt. Blackburn's squad, Misfit 1-3, attempts to find and safely return a U.S. squad investigating an improvised explosive device in Sulaymaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan, whose last known position was in territory controlled by the PLR (People's Liberation & Resistance), an Iranian paramilitary insurgent group. They find the missing squad, which had been ambushed by the PLR; but before they can escape the city, a massive earthquake wrecks the city. Blackburn, fellow squadmate Montes, and other survivors fight their way out of the ruins of the city. On the same day, the PLR stage a coup d'√©tat in Iran, turning it into a military dictatorship, and the U.S. subsequently invades. Lt. Hawkins takes part in a raid on enemy fighters over Iran and an air strike over Mehrabad Airport. In the aftermath of the air strikes, Misfit 1 was sent into Tehran to perform battle damage assessment and apprehend the leader of the PLR, Faruk Al-Bashir. While investigating an underground bank vault in the target's suspected location, Blackburn and his team learn that the PLR have acquired Russian suitcase nukes, with two of the three devices missing. Being overrun, Misfit requests backup from an M1 Abrams column \\"Anvil 3\\", including Sergeant Miller. Miller facilitates Misfit 1's helicopter extraction, but his Abrams tank is disabled and overrun while the crew awaits the arrival of the Quick Reaction Force. Knocked out and taken prisoner, Miller is promptly executed by Solomon and Al-Bashir, with the event being filmed and posted on the Internet. Later, Misfit 1-3 manages to capture Al-Bashir, who becomes fatally wounded when they cause his escape vehicle to crash. Realizing that he had been betrayed and used, Al-Bashir reveals some of Solomon's plan‚Äîto detonate the nukes in Paris and New York City‚Äîbefore succumbing to his wounds. Misfit 1 gets a lead on arms dealer Amir Kaffarov, who was working with Solomon and Al-Bashir. They attempt to capture Kaffarov from his villa on the Caspian Sea coast, near the Azerbaijani border. However, they run into a Russian paratrooper battalion, also after Kaffarov, who engage them with airdropped BMP-2s, with Su-25s providing close air support. In the ensuing chaos, Blackburn's squadmates, Campo and Matkovic, are killed in an enemy strafing run. Meanwhile, a Spetsnaz team led by Dima assaults Kaffarov's villa. Kaffarov tries to bribe his way out, but Dima beats him up nonetheless. Blackburn arrives at the villa and finds Dima and a presumed dead Kaffarov. Dima reveals Solomon's plot to Blackburn, and requests his cooperation to prevent \\"a war between [their] nations\\". Meanwhile, Misfit 1's commanding officer Cole arrives, and Blackburn is forced to shoot his superior before he can kill Dima. Blackburn's shooting of his commanding officer results in his eight-hour interrogation by the C.I.A. at Hunters Point, Queens. During Blackburn's captivity, Dima's Spetsnaz squad attempts to stop the attack in Paris. However, Vladimir is impaled and dies, and the nuke explodes, killing 80,000 people. Meanwhile, the C.I.A. agents do not believe Blackburn's story, since Solomon is a C.I.A. informant, and there is no concrete proof of his involvement in the terrorist attacks. They instead believe that Russia is responsible for the attacks, and that Dima has tricked Blackburn. With no other options, Blackburn and surviving squad member Montes break out of captivity to stop the attack in New York. Evading police, Blackburn manages to break into the hijacked Long Island Rail Road commuter train from the prologue, which is full of Solomon's men and explosive charges. He works his way to the front car, where he is ambushed by Solomon. When ambushed by Solomon, Blackburn gains the upper hand by obtaining and activating the detonator to the charges, causing the train to crash. Blackburn pursues Solomon through the sewers and up to street level. Montes, having obtained a police car, picks up Blackburn and engages Solomon and the PLR in a brief vehicular chase, which ends with both cars crashing in Times Square. As a bewildered crowd watches on, Solomon shoots Montes, but Blackburn manages to kill Solomon by bludgeoning him to death with a brick in the ensuing brawl and recovers the nuclear bomb. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Dima had survived the Paris detonation, albeit suffering radiation poisoning from the blast. He writes about the efforts of both himself and Blackburn to stop Solomon's plan \\"to set fire to the world\\". As he finishes, he examines a pistol. A knock comes from his door, the screen cuts to black, and the last sound is that of the pistol being loaded as Dima presumably prepares to defend himself. Development Battlefield 3s lead platform was originally the PC until it was switched to consoles midway through development. The Xbox 360 version of Battlefield 3 is shipped on two discs due to the disc size limit; however, the PS3 version ships on one Blu-ray Disc. It is the first game in the series that does not support versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista as the game only supports DirectX 10 and 11. The PC version was exclusive to EA's Origin platform, through which PC users also authenticate when connecting to the game; however the game eventually arrived on Steam in June 2020. Battlefield 3 debuts the new Frostbite 2 engine. This updated Frostbite engine can realistically portray the destruction of buildings and scenery to a greater extent than previous versions. Unlike previous iterations, the new version can also support dense urban areas. Battlefield 3 used a new type of character animation technology called ANT that has been used in EA Sports games such as FIFA, but for Battlefield 3 is adapted to create a more realistic soldier, with the ability to transition into cover and turn the head before the body, as well as \\"drag fallen comrades into safety and mount weapons on almost any part of the terrain\\". EA stated that Commander Mode was unlikely to be included, which was met with some criticism on the EA forum. =PlayStation 3 exclusive content= During Sony's E3 2011 press conference, Jack Tretton of Sony Computer Entertainment of America announced that the PlayStation 3 version of the game would be bundled with a free copy of Battlefield 1943, however, at launch, the game was not included. EA then said that Battlefield 3 PlayStation 3 owners would receive timed-exclusive DLC for the game instead. On 20 November 2011, Law firm Edelson McGuire took EA to court on behalf of disappointed gamers. The complaint focuses on EA's communication of the change of plan, second proposal with early DLC that had already been announced. Shortly after EA was threatened with being taken to court over its failure to deliver the free game as announced at E3, EA announced they will offer owners of the PlayStation 3 version of Battlefield 3 a free downloadable copy of Battlefield 1943. =Wii U version= On 7 June 2011, during Nintendo's E3 2011 press conference, John Riccitiello of EA games expressed interest in Nintendo's upcoming system, the Wii U. Patrick Liu, the executive producer of Battlefield 3, stated that EA DICE currently have no games in development for the Wii U and a port for the console \\"probably won't happen\\". =Beta= The open beta commenced on 29 September 2011, for all platforms, and ended on 10 October 2011. 48 hour early access was granted to players who bought the Tier 1 edition of Medal of Honor or pre-ordered the digital version of Battlefield 3: Limited Edition through Origin. =Soundtrack= A soundtrack album was released on 24 October 2011, one day before the game was released. It is available on iTunes and Amazon. The music was composed by Johan Skugge and Jukka Rintam√§ki. =Easter eggs= Battlefield 3 and its five DLC packs contain numerous Easter eggs. Hiding in obscure areas of the game are references to other Electronic Arts games and franchises including Mirror's Edge and Mass Effect. Some sources suggested other Easter eggs pointed to future Battlefield games or DLC packs. During the firefight in the mall trying to protect Al-Bashir, the store in which they are defending Al-Bashir has copies of games on the shelf and one game being titled \\"Frostbite\\" which references the engine used by Battlefield 3. A wall on the multiplayer map \\"Wake Island\\" featuring the number 2143 and a futuristic hovercraft on a different map in the End Game DLC have been said to suggest a follow up to 2006's Battlefield 2142 is in the works. Several dinosaur Easter eggs‚Äîsuch as a flying pterodactyl on the map \\"Nebandan Flats\\" and tyrannosaurus skulls or toy statues on various maps‚Äîhave led others to believe a dinosaur-related game or DLC would be released in the future. The idea of a dinosaur-related minigame originated from fan feedback through social media outlets prior to Battlefield 3s release. Neither of these possible upcoming games has been confirmed by EA. Marketing and release Promotion of Battlefield 3 at Paris Games Week 2011 A MiG-21 display during the promotion at gamescom 2011 Battlefield 3 was revealed on 3 February 2011 by Game Informer. The coverage included information on building the game and interviews with the developer DICE, as well as three trailers: a teaser and the first two parts in a series of gameplay from the level \\"Fault Line\\". Several other trailers were released showing different aspects of the game, including both single and multiplayer, as well as emphasizing the new engine. On 16 August 2011, co-op gameplay and a \\"Caspian Border Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer\\" were shown at gamescom 2011 illustrating the co-op mode and the first footage of air combat, respectively. Trailer releases gained momentum in the week before the release of the game. EA released a multiplayer trailer which showed the variety of maps available in multiplayer, with short scenes of actual gameplay. It also featured shots of a map that is included in the \\"Back to Karkand\\" downloadable content (DLC). EA released a launch trailer, showing off the various missions in the single-player campaign. EA CEO John Riccitiello stated that Battlefield 3 is aimed at competing with the Call of Duty series. EA planned on spending over $100 million on a marketing campaign for Battlefield 3. Electronic Arts stated that Battlefield 3 is a \\"flat out superior\\" to Call of Duty. EA has said it is going on the \\"offense\\" in regards to its marketing on Battlefield 3, saying that it started its campaign early to establish a \\"beachhead\\". Anyone who had watched a trailer for the upcoming film Act of Valor through the official Battlefield 3 website could receive free downloadable dogtags for use with any version of the game. For marketing and distribution to Japan, EA worked with Sega's Japanese branch to distribute the game nationwide. In January 2017, the game was made backwards compatible with the Xbox One (alongside Battlefield: Bad Company 2) and was subsequently added to the EA Access service.https://www.eurogamer.net/2017-01-10-battlefield-3-and-bad- company-2-are-now-backwards-compatible-on-xbox-one =Pre-order promotion= All pre-orders of the Limited Edition grant free access to the \\"Back to Karkand\\" DLC pack, a reference to the \\"Strike at Karkand\\" map (a popular Battlefield 2 map), to include four maps brought over from Battlefield 2, ten new weapons, four new vehicles, five new achievements/trophies, and a new addition to the series, \\"Assignments\\". The maps from the expansion pack will be: Strike at Karkand, Gulf of Oman, Wake Island, and Sharqi Peninsula. Pre- ordering at selected retailers and Origin included the \\"Physical Warfare Pack\\", granting access to time-based exclusive weapons and items; including a light machine gun, a sniper rifle accessory, and armor-piercing ammunition. Also included is launch day access to the DAO-12 semi-automatic shotgun, which other players can unlock through game play. Pre-order at select retailers also provide the \\"SPECACT Kit Upgrade\\", the \\"Dog Tag Pack\\" and Battlefield 3 gear for the player's console avatar. Pre-ordering at Origin gave players a shotgun and beret for Battlefield Play4Free, and 48 hour early access to the Battlefield 3 beta. Originally the \\"Physical Warfare Pack\\" was to be exclusive to pre-orders, but fan reaction to this was negative, causing EA to clarify that it would be made available to all players for free later in the year. On 2 September 2011, a trailer for the Physical Warfare Pack was released on YouTube showing all the content included within the pack in action in-game. All the content except the \\"Back to Karkand\\" pack was available from day one. The pack was released on 6 December 2011 for the PlayStation 3, and a week later for the Xbox 360 and PC. =Online pass= To access the game's online multiplayer mode on consoles, players need to activate an online pass. New copies of the game include one online pass for the original owner of the game to access the multiplayer; however, if a player buys a used copy or rents the game, they must purchase an online pass separately, or access a 48-hour trial via the official game site. When asked why the developers implemented the pass system, game designer Alan Kertz replied, \\"because servers cost money, and used games don't make developers any money.\\" Some of the online pass codes were invalid from the time of purchase, which EA responded to by telling affected consumers to ask the retailer for a replacement code. = Downloadable content = Back to Karkand The first DLC pack, \\"Back to Karkand\\", was announced before launch and was released on 13 December 2011 for PC and Xbox 360, while PlayStation 3 owners received it a week earlier. It was priced at US$15 but was free for all users who purchased the limited edition. It features four maps remade from Battlefield 2, three new vehicles and ten new weapons. Close Quarters At GDC 2012 DICE revealed it would release three more DLCs. The second DLC, \\"Close Quarters\\" arrived in June 2012 featuring four new infantry-oriented maps, ten new weapons, HD Destruction, ten new assignments, five unique Dogtags, and a new game mode, Conquest Domination, a Conquest mode adapted for smaller spaces. [ http://help.ea.com/en/article/battlefield-3-close-quarters-faq/ \\"Battlefield 3 Close Quarters expansion pack information\\"], EA Help, Accessed 5 August 2015 Armored Kill The third DLC, \\"Armored Kill\\" arrived on 4 September 2012 for premium PlayStation 3 users and 11 September for Xbox 360 and PC users. The DLC was made available for non-premium PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users on 25 September 2012. Armored Kill included new vehicles, specifically tanks, ATVs, and mobile artillery, as well as new vehicle-oriented maps and what is called \\"the biggest map in Battlefield history\\". Aftermath A DLC titled \\"Aftermath\\" was revealed in a trailer for Battlefield 3 Premium. It was released to PlayStation 3 Premium subscribers on 27 November 2012 and to PC and Xbox 360 Premium subscribers on 4 December 2012. \\"Aftermath\\" was released to non-Premium subscribers on PlayStation 3 on 11 December 2012, and on PC and Xbox 360 on 18 December 2012. A video released by DICE games revealed that there would be a crossbow, with customizable scopes and various bolts before its release. End Game The fifth DLC, \\"End Game\\", was released for PlayStation 3 Premium members on 5 March 2013 and to PC and Xbox 360 Premium members on 12 March 2013, then to non-Premium PlayStation 3 players on 19 March 2013 and to PC and Xbox 360 players on 26 March 2013. It was developed in conjunction with Visceral Games. =Novel= Andy McNab penned a tie-in novel titled Battlefield 3: The Russian, which follows the story of GRU Spetsnaz commando Dmitri \\"Dima\\" Mayakovsky and his involvement against the PLR, as well as his connection to the antagonist, Solomon. McNab also served as the game's consultant on military tactics. The novel was released on 25 October 2011. Reception =Critical reception= Battlefield 3 received mostly positive reviews. IGN gave it a score of 9.0 out of 10.0 for all platforms, and praised the graphics and multiplayer game. Even though it criticized the single-player campaign story, and the occasional glitches of the game engine, it still gave the game a mostly positive review, \\"Regardless of the narrative missteps or the occasional glitches, Battlefield 3 offers an unforgettable, world-class multiplayer suite that's sure to excite shooter fans.\\" Joystiq awarded the game 4.5 out of 5 stars, stating that the campaign was \\"tactically linear\\" and that the A.I. within the game were \\"murderously un-fun to fight\\". Complaints were also made of the multiplayer aspect, stating that destruction was less than expected: \\"It's not Bad Company 2, and levels won't start out intact and end looking like the surface of the moon the way they often did in that game.\\" They did, however, praise the multiplayer experience as \\"unmatched\\", stating that this should be the sole reason to buy the game. GameSpot gave Battlefield 3 a score of 8.5 out of 10 across all platforms. They praised the deep multiplayer mode, great variety of vehicles, many well-designed environments, and a great reward system for team play; however, they criticized the campaign for being \\"dull and disappointing\\" and using a \\"familiar formula\\". The cooperative mode was viewed favorably; the only criticism on the cooperative missions was that \\"there aren't more of them to keep you busy\\". Official Xbox Magazine gave the game 9 out of 10, commending the game for its multiplayer mode, but criticizing the solo campaign. Similarly, Official Xbox Magazine (UK) gave the game 8 out of 10, applauding its multiplayer gaming and calling it \\"The most expansive, refined Battlefield multiplayer yet\\" while also criticizing the single-player experience. =Sales= According to EA, Battlefield 3 garnered 3 million pre- orders by the day of its release. The pre-order total makes it \\"the biggest first-person shooter launch in EA history\\", according to the publisher. Two days after launch, EA CEO John Riccitiello announced via a conference call to investors that Battlefield 3 has already shipped 10 million units within a week of release, with 3 million of those being pre-orders. Electronic Arts stated that the title sold 5 million units within the first week of availability, easily becoming its fastest-selling game. After one month, EA chief financial officer Eric Brown announced Battlefield 3 had sold 8 million copies, and that the publisher has shipped 12 million copies of the game to retailers, 2 million more than it shipped for launch week. Peter Moore, the high-profile COO of EA, insisted that Battlefield 3 successfully captured a slice of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3's market share. On 29 June 2012 EA revealed that the game has sold 15 million copies. In Japan, Battlefield 3 had sold around 123,379 copies for the PlayStation 3 and 27,723 copies for the Xbox 360 when it was released. In the first week, the game had sold 18,792 copies for the PlayStation 3 for a total of 142,171 copies. The PlayStation 3 version later sold 8,094 copies for a total of 150,265 copies. =Other responses= A scene in which the player is prompted to kill a rat that is attacking their character was criticized by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In a press release issued by the organization's German office, it claimed that the game \\"treats animals in a sadistic manner\\". The release also went further on to say that the scene can have \\"a brutalising effect on the young male target audience\\". The reproduction of various scenes in Battlefield 3 are highly accurate of their real-life counterparts such as the Grand Bazaar. Iran has reacted to the scenes set within Iran by banning the sale of the game. As the game had not been officially released in the country, the authorities were strictly enforcing the prevention of the distribution of pirated copies of the game. This comes after Iranian gamers had protested the release of the game and called for an apology. =Awards= * Best Shooter, 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best Multiplayer Game, 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best Xbox 360 Shooter, Best of 2011 IGN Award & 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best Xbox 360 Multiplayer Game, Best of 2011 IGN Award & 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best PS3 Shooter, 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best PS3 Multiplayer Game, Best of 2011 IGN Award & 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best PC Shooter, Best of 2011 IGN Award & 2011 IGN People's Choice Award * Best PC Multiplayer Game, Best of 2011 IGN Award & 2011 IGN People's Choice Award Notes References External links Category:2011 video games Category:Aerial warfare in fiction Category:Asymmetrical multiplayer video games * 09 Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Esports games Category:First-person shooters Category:IOS games Category:Martyrdom in fiction Category:Mass murder in fiction Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Trains in fiction Category:Video games about nuclear war and weapons Category:Video games about the United States Marine Corps Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Video games set in 2014 Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Iran Category:Video games set in Iraq Category:Video games set in New York City Category:War video games set in the United States Category:Video games set in Paris Category:Video games set in Ukraine Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:War video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Frostbite (game engine) games Category:Video games adapted into novels Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"Battlefield 3"},{"id":"23179218","text":"ENAH may refer to: *ENAH (gene), a gene [Enabled homolog (Drosophila)] located on chromosome 1 in humans *Escuela Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, the national educational institute for anthropological and historical studies in Mexico City, Mexico ","title":"ENAH"},{"id":"23179224","text":"The Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (, ') was a republican level branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the Russian SFSR. The Communist Party of the Russian SFSR was founded in 1990.Harris, Jonathan. Subverting the System: Gorbachev's Reform of the Party's Apparat, 1986‚Äì1991. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. pp. 110‚Äì3. At this point, the Communist Party of the Russian SFSR organized around 58% of the total Communist Party of the Soviet Union membership.Backes, Uwe. Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe. G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2008. 437 The party was popularly known as the 'Russian Communist Party'.O'Connor, Kevin. Intellectuals and Apparatchiks: Russian Nationalism and the Gorbachev Revolution. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. p. 165. Politically, it became a centre for communist opponents of Gorbachev's rule. Background For many years, the Russian SFSR had been the sole Soviet republic without a republican-level Communist Party of its own. In fact, in 1947 the NKVD had run an investigation in the so- called Leningrad case against party functionaries accused of wanting to set up a republican Communist Party in the RSFSR.Buttino, Marco. In a Collapsing Empire: Underdevelopment, Ethnic Conflicts and Nationalisms in the Soviet Union. Milano: Feltrinelli, 1993. p. 61 In 1989 a sector of the Communist Party (opposed to the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev) launched a campaign for an autonomous Russian republican-level Communist Party. In June 1989 an article was published in Nash sovremennik by Galina Litinova, arguing that the Russian nation had regressed during Soviet rule and that it was necessary to form a Central Committee for the Communist Party of the RSFSR.O'Connor, Kevin. Intellectuals and Apparatchiks: Russian Nationalism and the Gorbachev Revolution. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. p. 148 Preparations The Communist Party of the RSFSR emerged from an alliance between Leningrad-based apparatchiks and Russian national-patriotic tendencies. The United Workers Front was one of the key backers of the new party organization.O'Connor, Kevin. Intellectuals and Apparatchiks: Russian Nationalism and the Gorbachev Revolution. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. pp. 178‚Äì9. Gorbachev faced difficulties in trying to block the formation of a Russian party organization. Many Russian members of the Communist Party who were not necessarily followers of Gorbahev's hard-line opponents were supportive of the effort to form a Russian party organization. On Gorbachev's initiative a RSFSR Bureau of the Communist Party was founded towards the end of 1989, in a move to block the formation of an autonomous Russian Communist Party. However this action did not block the demand for a RSFSR Communist Party, and the newly formed RSFSR Bureau issued a call for the founding of the Communist Party of the RSFSR. This process was humiliating for Gorbachev, as it clarified that he was not fully in control of the party apparatus. Prior to the founding of the new party organization, a debate surged regarding the name of the new body. Chechen-Ingush communists argued that the name should include 'RSFSR' rather than just 'Russian'. Moreover, decision had been passed that the congress would be divided in two sessions, before and after the 28th party congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.Ogushi, Atsushi. The Demise of the Soviet Communist Party. London: Routledge, 2008. pp. 100‚Äì1 First Congress Session The first session of the founding congress of the Communist Party of the RSFSR opened in Moscow on 19 June 1990.White, Stephen, Graeme J. Gill, and Darrell Slider. The Politics of Transition: Shaping a Post-Soviet Future. Cambridge, ENG, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1993. p. 132 2,768 delegates attended the congress. There were three key contenders for the post of First Secretary, Valentin Kuptsov, Ivan Polozkov and Oleg Lobov (Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia). Kuptsov, the candidate supported by Gorbachev and the all-Union party leadership, suffered a heavy defeat. He received a mere 343 votes in favour whilst 2,278 delegates voted against him. Polozkov obtained 1,017 votes in favour and 1,604 against him, whilst Lobov got 848 votes in favour and 1,773 votes against him. A run-off was held between Polozkov and Lobov. Polozkov was elected with 1,396 against 1,066 for Lobov. The first session of the founding congress concluded on 23 June 1990.. Polozkov was a leader of the hardline faction, hailing from Krasnodar. After having been elected, Polozkov tried to distance himself from the most hardline elements (represented by Nina Andreyeva) and sought conciliation between Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and the Communist Party of the RSFSR. Second Congress Session The founding congress of the Communist Party of the RSFSR reconvened at its second session from 4 September to 6 September 1990. The second session elected 272 Central Committee members and 96 Central Control Commission members for the party.. By then, the political struggle had sharpened; Polozkov called on the communists in the RSFSR to oppose the restoration of capitalism by Yeltsin's government. The Communist Party of the RSFSR had, then, around 40% of the seats in the newly formed Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR.Harris, Jonathan. Subverting the System: Gorbachev's Reform of the Party's Apparat, 1986‚Äì1991. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. p. 128 Political role The new party organization was divided into reformist, hardline and nationalistic sectors. Polozkov played an important role as defining the role of the party as force of the anti-Perestroika opposition.O'Connor, Kevin. Intellectuals and Apparatchiks: Russian Nationalism and the Gorbachev Revolution. Lanham, MD: Lexington Books Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. pp. 179, 223, 291 However, his style of leadership was passive and he came under attack from all corners inside the party. The deputies in the RSFSR Supreme Soviet attacked him for not attacking Gorbachev, whilst the communists in Kaliningrad criticized him for his opposition against Yeltsin.Harris, Jonathan. Adrift in Turbulent Seas: The Political and Ideological Struggles of Ivan Kuz'mich Polozkov. Center for Russian and East European Studies, Univ. of Pittsburgh, 1993. p. 26 The launching of the Communist Party of the RSFSR caused organizational problems for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as membership fees from the RSFSR were now supposed to pass through the republican party organization. Some lower-level party organization did however continue to pay their dues directly to the all-Union party, essentially as acts of defiance against the hardliners in control of the Communist Party of the RSFSR.Ogushi, Atsushi. The Demise of the Soviet Communist Party. London: Routledge, 2008. pp. 121‚Äì2. The party became a member of the Coordinating Council of Patriotic Forces, which campaigned for a unified Soviet Union in the March 1991 referendum.O'Connor, Kevin.

Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. p. 250 Removal of Polozkov On 6 August 1991, Polozkov was removed from his position as leader of the Communist Party of the RSFSR, after having called Gorbachev a traitor three days earlier.

Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. p. 265 Banning In the fall of 1991, Yeltsin issued three presidential decrees resulting in the disbanding of the party. On 23 August 1991, he issued a decree titled 'On suspending the activities of the Communist Party of the RSFSR'. On 25 August 1991, Yeltsin issued a Decree no. 90 declared that the activities of the party were suspended and that all the properties of the Communist Party of the RSFSR would become RSFSR state property. And on 6 November 1991, he issued a decree that banned the already defunct party.Ogushi, Atsushi. The Demise of the Soviet Communist Party.

It is open daily, except on 24 and 31 December; an admission fee is charged. Munich's first botanical garden, now called the \\"old botanical garden\\", was established in 1809 to designs by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell near Karlsplatz, where its remains are still visible. The old botanical garden was replaced by a new garden created next to the Nymphenburg Palace Park in 1912-1913 and officially opened on 10 May 1914. The garden was designed by Peter Holfelder (1878-1936) who worked closely with Walter Kupper (1874 - 1953) and Leonhard Dillis (1871 - 1946). Today the garden cultivates about 19.600 species and subspecies on approximately 18 hectares. Its mission is to provide a beautiful and restful environment as well as educate the public about plants and nature more broadly. Major collections include an alpine garden, an arboretum, rose collections, and a so-called 'systematic garden' in which plants are arranged by taxonomic families. The garden also contains an extensive greenhouse complex (4,500 m¬≤ total area in 11 greenhouses), including greenhouses dedicated to bromeliads and aroids Araceae, cacti and succulents, cycads, ferns, orchids, and Mexican plants.

Development The Flakpanzer I was developed during the Battle of France when it was recognized that the motorised Flak was insufficiently armoured. The German Heereswaffenamt decided to combine light anti-aircraft guns with tank chassis. The chassis of the Panzer I was used for these conversions, simply because it was available. The conversions were done by Stoewer. In total, 24 of these vehicles were built. During the conversion, parts of the frontal superstructure and the complete cover of the engine compartment were removed to gain more flat space to stand on. To achieve a better centre of gravity the frontal armour of the superstructure was moved about 18mm forward. The flaps on the side were made from simple sheet metal and did not offer real protection. When in action they were folded down and used to stand on. To gain more space (the Panzer I was a very small armoured vehicle) the radio was dismounted; communication was done with hand signals. The vehicles were armed with the Flak 38; additionally, the crew was armed with small arms, like the Karabiner 98k. To make it easier for the driver to enter the vehicle, the main gun was mounted not centrally, but slightly to the right. The ammunition was stored under the driver's seat and behind the loader. Due to insufficient space inside the vehicle, a coupling for the Sonderanh√§nger 51 trailer was added, with additional ammunition and replacement barrels for the gun transported in the trailer. Service Only one unit, the Fla.-Btl.(mot) 614 (Motorized Flak Battalion 614) was equipped with the Flakpanzer I. The unit was assembled in 1941 and in the same year was stationed in Romania. From there they moved into the southern part of the eastern front. In service the vehicles were of limited use against aircraft, but were mostly used against ground targets because the gun could only fire straight forward being in a relatively fixed mount. For proper anti-aircraft fire, a traversable gun mount was preferable, but space was far too limited on the Panzer I chassis for such mounts. Due to the insufficient protection of the crew in this sort of deployment, they suffered high losses. The companies of the battalion were assigned to other units for this. The whole battalion was wiped out in 1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad, even though most of the vehicles had probably been abandoned or destroyed already.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 as the \\"Jones County Court House.\\" It is a part of the PWA-Era County Courthouses of IA Multiple Properties Submission, and is the third building the county has used for court functions and county administration. History The first Jones County Courthouse was built in 1847 for $800. The building measured , and was occupied on January 3, 1848. The county declared the building unsafe and vacated it in 1864. It was destroyed by fire in 1875. The county rented space until the city of Anamosa appropriated $6,000 to buy the second floor of the Shaw Block to insure the county seat would not move to Center Junction. A plan to build a courthouse in 1920 failed. There was, however, a lack of pride in the county facilities that were declining in condition that threatened the security of county records. with The county board of supervisors applied to the Public Works Administration, or PWA, for a grant to build a new courthouse and a referendum was approved by 77 percent of voters on September 10, 1935. Des Moines architects Dougher, Rich & Woodburn designed the new building. Excavation for the courthouse was begun once the PWA approved the grant. The cornerstone was laid on August 9, 1936. C.C. Larsen & Sons Co. of Council Bluffs won the contract to build the building. Completion was delayed because of contract delays and cost overruns. The building's final construction costs were $200,000. County offices moved into the building in August and the dedication was held on September 10, 1937. Nearly 6,000 people attended the ceremonies. Governor Nelson G. Kraschel delivered the main address. Other speakers included State PWA Director P.P. Hopkins and Justice J.M. Parsons of the Iowa Supreme Court, who was a Jones County native. Architecture The architectural style of the building is known as Depression Modern or PWA Moderne. The building features a symmetrical fa√ßade with a central section that is flanked by two lower sections. The exterior is composed of buff- colored brick and Bedford limestone trim. It is three stories tall and built on a raised basement. On the interior, the central corridors extend the length of the building, with the county offices opening onto the corridors. The building features multi-colored terrazzo floors, marble wainscoting, and acoustic tiles. The courtroom was originally decorated in dark wood tones and Art Deco ornamentation. The courthouse is located on a large rectangular plot of land overlooking the Anamosa State Penitentiary on the west side of town. The land had previously been a city park and is a contributing site on the courthouse's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The original flagpole in front of the building is a contributing object. The two veterans monuments on the property, one from the 1970s or 1980s, and one from 2002 are non-contributing objects.

In 2016 he received the International Fisheries Science Prize at the World Fisheries Congress in Busan, South Korea. The award recognized his 40-year career of ‚Äúhighly diversified research and publication in support of global fisheries science and conservation,‚Äù according to a news release. His major areas of current and past research interest include \\"Bayesian analysis of decision making in natural resources, adaptive management of renewable resources, the dynamics of the Serengeti ecosystem in east Africa, the role of hatcheries in management of Pacific salmon, the ability of institutions to learn from experience, statistical methods in testing dynamic ecological hypotheses, the analysis of migration and dispersal from mark‚Äìrecapture data, and the ecological dynamics of fishing fleets.\\" Fisheries management research In their research, Hilborn and Walters investigated the ways that dynamic models can be used to manage fisheries in order to maintain states of optimum equilibrium. In their paper,Adaptive Control of Fishing Systems. 1975 they examined the effectiveness of using the Ricker and Beverton-Holt models to estimate the potential yield of future generations by using data taken from prior generations. They addressed the problem that, in regards to fisheries, the parameters of the control system are often either varied or uncertain and the use of historical data becomes progressively more unreliable as it gets older. Variables, regarding these issues, include natural mortality and spawning rates as well the effects of human fishing, as a predator-prey relationship. Influenced by control theory, Hilborn and Walters modified the original models with various new formulae to create alternative models, in order to achieve more accurate predictions. They then identified ‚Äúa series of alternative harvesting experiments‚Ä¶ each of which would be reasonably certain to discriminate between the alternative models‚Ä¶‚ÄùWalters, Carl; Hilborn, Ray (September 1975). \\"Adaptive Control of Fishing Systems\\": 19. The development of these alternative models and harvesting methods has been invaluable in assessing the sustainability of the world's fisheries. Hilborn‚Äôs research ‚Äúaims to identify how to best manage fisheries to provide sustainable benefits to human society. This involves a combination of building data bases on how fisheries are managed and measures of their performance.‚ÄùHilborn, Ray. https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/ray-hilborn/. He has contributed extensively to The Ram Legacy databasehttp://ramlegacy.org// which ‚Äúprovides estimates of status indicators such as biomass, fishing mortality rates, and associated reference points, and is the most quantitatively robust source of fishery status available.‚ÄùHilborn, Ray; Ovado, Daniel (14 March 2014). \\"Food for Thought: Reflections on the success of traditional fisheries management\\". ICES Journal of Marine Science (2014). 71 (5). doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsu034. Hilborn's efforts attempt to strike a balance between resource sustainability for the environment and food and nutrition security for human beings. When it comes to large scale management of fisheries, he contends that there is ‚Äúno single solution, and what is appropriate for one community for a specific species may be totally different for another species or community‚ÄùHilborn, Ray. \\"Knowledge on How To Achieve Sustainable Fisheries\\": 53. According to Hilborn, successful management strategies involve a combination of limiting access to fisheries, maintaining biological productivity and the cooperation of all stakeholders involved. Controversy In 2016 in a publicly posted 8-page letter to the President of the University of Washington, Greenpeace USA accused Dr. Hilborn of conflict of interest in the conduct of his research about the effects of fishing on the health of fish populations. Greenpeace alleged that undisclosed research and consulting funding provided to Dr. Hilborn from the sea food industry had influenced his research. Hilborn denied the charges and was cleared after formal investigation by the University of Washington. In October 2017 the NOAA Assistant Administrator for Fisheries wrote an open letter to the journal Marine Policy about a published paper co-authored by Tony J. Pitcher which suggested the U.S. exports to Japan a significant amount of seafood products from illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU).Pramod, G., Pitcher, T.J. and Mantha, G. (2017) \\"Estimates of illegal and unreported seafood imports to Japan\\". Marine Policy, 84: 42‚Äì51. .

His first preferment (1630) in the church was as lecturer at St. Mildred's, Bread Street, London, where his puritanism got him into trouble. On 6 July 1639 he was presented by Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, to the vicarage of Coggeshall, Essex, in succession to John Dod. On the opening of the Long parliament he regained his lectureship at St. Mildred's, and became known as a vigorous preacher against episcopacy. In the autumn of 1642 he was chaplain to the regiment of foot raised by Denzil Holles. He was a member of the Westminster Assembly (1643), and in the same year was appointed a licenser of the press.

Her first important research, community studies of rickets in New Haven, Connecticut, and Puerto Rico, explored issues at the heart of social medicine. Together with Edwards A.

Biography  Martha May Eliot was a scion of the Eliot family, an influential American family that is regarded as one of the Boston Brahmins, originating in Boston, whose ancestors became wealthy and held sway over the American education system in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Her father, Christopher Rhodes Eliot, was a Unitarian minister, and her grandfather, William G. Eliot, was the first chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. The poet, playwright, critic, and Nobel laureate T.S. Eliot was her first cousin. The Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. Martha May Eliot and Ethel Collins Dunham, 1915 During undergraduate study at Bryn Mawr College she met Ethel Collins Dunham, who was to become her life partner. After completing their undergraduate education, the two enrolled together at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1914. In 1918, Eliot graduated from medical school at Johns Hopkins University. As early as her second year of medical school, Dr. Eliot hoped to become \\"some kind of social doctor.\\" She taught at Yale University's department of pediatrics from 1921 to 1935. For most of these years, Dr. Eliot also directed the National Children's Bureau Division of Child and Maternal Health (1924‚Äì1934). She later accepted a full-time position at the bureau, becoming bureau chief in 1951. In 1956, she left the bureau to become department chairman of child and maternal health at Harvard School of Public Health. During her tenure at the Children's Bureau, Eliot helped establish government programs that implemented her ideas about social medicine, and she was responsible for drafting most of the Social Security Act's language dealing with maternal and child health. During World War II, she administered the Emergency Maternity and Infant Care program, which provided maternity care for greater than 1 million servicemen's wives. After the war, she held influential positions in both the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). From 1949 to 1951, Eliot worked as an assistant director for WHO in Geneva. In 1959, Martha accepted a post as chair of the Massachusetts Commission on Children and Youth, a position she held for a decade.Cynthia Grant Tucker, No Silent Witness: The Eliot Parsonage Women and their Unitarian World, Oxford University Press, 2010. She served as the chief architect of health provisions for children in the 1935 US Social Security Act, that mandated that every state establish child health services. In 1946, she served as the vice chair of the US delegation to the International Health Conference and on behalf of the US, signed the constitution that established the World Health Organization (she was the only woman to sign WHO's constitution).Lilian Faderman, To Believe in Women: What Lesbians Have Done for America - A History, Houghton Mifflin, June 8, 2000,  Personal life  Martha Jane Eliot shared her personal life in a long emotional and domestic partnership with Ethel Collins Dunham, also a pioneering female pediatrician, who was made the first female member of the American Pediatric Society and was awarded its highest award, the Howland Medal, in 1957. Lilian Faderman, the landmark scholar, writes: \\"[At] Bryn Mawr..she met a twenty-six year old freshman, Ethel Dunham. From 1910 to Ethel's death in 1969, the two women were inseparable. As a couple, Martha Eliot and Ethel Dunham..succeeded in times that were as unsympathetic to professional women as they were to lesbians. Their domestic satisfaction crept constantly into Martha's letters back home: \\"E. keeps me out doors which is great. This P.M. we are going canoeing. Tonight we are having supper here - oyster omelet, a concoction of Ethel's - and apple sauce and toast and nutbread.\\" \\" Their partnership nourished and sustained them through their entire adult lives. In the 1970s, during Martha's travels for WHO, they wrote day after day: \\"Dearest, it was hard to say goodbye and I shall miss you terribly.. Ever and ever so much love, my darling\\"; \\"How I count the time until you do arrive. I miss you my darling\\". Bert Hansen writes: \\"While Dunham and Eliot are each worthy of individual attention, their shared personal life has such an intimate connection with their careers that a combined narrative better illustrates their close relationship of 59 years. They achieved major professional positions at Yale, at Harvard, and in government, even while they were making careful career choices to maintain the continuity of their domestic partnership. Each was also accorded public honors for leadership in pediatrics, child welfare, and public health.\\" Awards and honors Dr. Eliot's service to public health earned her many honors. In 1951, President Truman named her chief of the Children's Bureau. In 1947, she became the first woman elected president of the American Public Health Association. She also was the first woman to receive APHA's Sedgwick Memorial Medal. * 1947 The first female president of the American Public Health Association. * 1947 Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service * 1949 to 1950 The President of the National Council of Social Work * 1958 Sedgwick Memorial Medal * 1967 John Howland Award The American Public Health Association established the Martha May Eliot Award in 1964 to honor extraordinary health service to mothers and children; to bring such achievement to the eyes of related professional people and the public; to stimulate young people in the field to emulate efforts resulting in such recognition; and to add within the profession and in the eyes of the public to the stature of professional workers in the field of maternal and child health.

The film is an adaption of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment. It was the fourth highest-grossing film in India of 1958 and was declared as a \\"Hit\\" at Box Office India.  Plot  Ram (Raj Kapoor) is a poor law student who supports his education with money orders from his mother and things he pawns. While struggling with his poor finances, he save a boy from an accident. Seeing the poor condition of the boy's family, he gives all his savings for the boy's treatment. Ram keeps visiting the boy and falls in love with the boy's elder sister Sohni (Mala Sinha). Sohni's father Gopal is addicted to liquor, which Harbanslal keeps providing him with. Harbanslal has a mean motive in doing so as he wants marry Sohni. To prevent Sohni's arranged marriage with Harbanslal, Ram decides to rob the pawn broker. But he is caught in the act, and he murders the pawn owner. Ram's conscience keeps telling him to admit to his crime. But he never picks up the courage to do so. The police inspector on the case keeps suspecting Ram for the crime. With no proof he, too, is helpless. Ram learns that the police have already arrested another thief and have charged him with this robbery and murder. On the last day, when the court is to rule in the case, Ram makes up his mind and admits. He pleads saying how he was acting in self-defense against real villains of the society. The court sentences him to three years of imprisonment. Sohni promises that she will wait for his release and then marry him.

The song \\"Chin-O-Arab Hamara, Hindustan Hamara, Rahne Ko Ghar Nahin Hain, Saara Jahan Hamara\\" sung by Mukesh and picturised on Raj Kapoor, became very popular yet controversial, and was very close to being banned then.  Reception  Phir Subah Hogi fared successfully at the box office and was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year 1958 behind Madhumati, Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi and Yahudi. The music composed by Khayyam is considered as \\"rich and beautiful\\". Songs like \\"Chin-O-Arab Hamara\\" and \\"Woh Subah Kabhi To Aayegi\\" penned by Sahir Ludhianvi were satirical on the condition of India and the Nehruvian politics. \\"Chin-o-Arab Hamara\\" was a parody on Iqbal's song \\"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\\".  Trivia  Lal Krishna Advani, a senior leader of \\"Bharatiya Janata Party\\", many a time in his speeches has talked about watching this movie along with his friend and colleague Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Advani reminisces that former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee was very fond of watching movies. He narrated an incident where in 1958 he and Vajpayee, after facing an electoral defeat in Delhi Municipal Corporation election, straightaway went to watch a movie. Advani says that the film turned out to be Phir Subah Hogi. Advani says that after Vajpayee became PM, he told party workers that the title of the movie had turned out to be prophetic and there was finally a dawn.

The technical development of COPERT is financed by the European Environment Agency (EEA), in the framework of the activities of the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change. Since 2007, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has been coordinating the further scientific development of the model. In principle, COPERT has been developed for use from the National Experts to estimate emissions from road transport to be included in official annual national inventories. The COPERT methodology is also part of the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook.

History The company was founded as the Birmingham Coffee House Company in 1877 and evolved through the early 20th century to become the Arden and Cobden Group, owning three Birmingham properties: the Arden Hotel, Cobden Hotel and Norfolk Hotel. In December 1985 the company was bought by Henry Edwards, an entrepreneur. In 1986, he floated the company under the name of Friendly Hotels PLC on the London Stock Exchange. The company became a franchisee of Choice Hotels International (CHI), a US-based hotel group, in 1996. It rebranded its Friendly Hotels and Friendly Stop Inns with the Comfort Inn and Quality Hotel brand names. The relationship prospered and in 1996, the company gained the master franchise from CHI to develop the Choice brands in the UK and Ireland, followed, in 1998, by the master franchise to develop the Comfort, Quality, Clarion and Sleep Inn brands across Continental Europe (excluding Scandinavia). In June 2001, CHI revealed that it was talking to several potential buyers about selling its stake in the company. In order to demonstrate synergy with CHI, the company changed its name from Friendly Hotels PLC to CHE Group PLC in August 2001. The talks with buyers ended in February 2002, and having failed to find a buyer, CHI simply wrote off its interest in the company. In October 2007, the company announced the launch of its new brand, Purple Hotels, and changed the its to The Real Hotel Company. However, the economic downturn hit the company hard, and it slid into losses in 2007. The company announced the suspension of the company's ordinary shares on the Alternative Investment Market on 13 January 2009. The company was placed into administration with Shay Bannon and Antony Nygate of BDO Stoy Hayward appointed as the administrators on 21 January 2009. The final property disposed of was the Quality Hotel in Perth which was sold in February 2011.

Biography He directed his first short film, Soleil √©teint in 1958. He changed his surname to Gilles based on the name of his mother (Gilette) to create a pseudonym. After studying at the Beaux-Arts, he moved to Paris, where he worked as an assistant to Fran√ßois Reichenbach in 1964. His first feature film, L'Amour √† la mer (1962), starred Juliette Gr√©co, Romy Schneider and Jean-Pierre L√©aud. Patrick Jouan featured in many of his films. He also worked for television with productions such as Dim, Dam, Dom and Pour le plaisir. His romantic relationship with Jeanne Moreau seemed to inspire the movie Absences r√©p√©t√©es which received the Prix Jean-Vigo in 1973. H√©l√®ne Martin requested him to make a documentary about Jean Genet Saint, po√®te et martyr. It was released at a gay film festival organized by Lionel Soukaz in 1978, and the film was troubled by a fascist group that injured the director. His latest films include Le Crime d'amour (1982), with Richard Berry and Jacques Penot, and Nuit docile (1987). He contracted AIDS in the late 1980s, and in experiencing difficulties with production, he struggled to complete N√©fertiti, la fille du soleil in 1994 which was released in 1996 on the year of death.

It concerns the correct method for interpretation and implication of terms into a company's articles of association. It was approved by the UK Supreme Court in Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, London Branch v Geys[2012] UKSC 63 and Marks and Spencer plc v BNP Paribas Securities Services Trust Company (Jersey) Ltd.[2015] UKSC 72 Facts In 1989 Belize privatised its telecoms network. Established the year after independence in 1974, the Belize Telecommunications Authority's business and assets were transferred to a corporation called Belize Telecommunications Ltd (renamed Belize Telemedia in 2007). The government was to gradually sell off its shares, but in the process retain a \\"special share\\" (often called a golden share). According to the company's constitution, among various rights over important transactions, the special shareholder could appoint two of the eight directors. Class \\"B\\" shareholders (which were all private investors, such as British Telecom) could appoint two directors and class \\"C\\" shareholders could together appoint four directors. The government owned class \\"C\\" shares, and there was a further provision that if the special shareholder still had over 37.5% of the total share capital, it would be entitled to appoint two of those four \\"C\\" directors. In 2003 the government decided to complete the privatisation process. Legislation was passed to try to let competition into the telecoms market. In 2004 Belize Telecom bought the special share from the government. It also bought the \\"C\\" shares the government still owned. But to finance this, it got a loan from the government. In other words, the government converted its shares in Belize Telecommunications Ltd to debt. For security until the debt was repaid the government got a pledge on the shares it had just sold (but not the special share). Immediately Belize Telecom appointed new directors, replacing the government appointees. But unfortunately on 9 February 2005, Belize Telecom defaulted on its loan repayments. The government enforced its pledge, and now once again had over 37.5% of the \\"C\\" shares, but without the special share. The question was whether the two directors that were subject to appointment by the person who held the special share and over 37.5% of the \\"C\\" shares could be removed. As it stood, nobody held both the special share and 37.5% of the \\"C\\" shares. The company's constitution did not have any provisions about this situation. In 2008, after the United Democratic Party was elected on a platform of anti- corruption and honesty, this action was brought to change the board. Belize Telecom argued that those two directors were not removable. The Attorney General, for the government, argued this would be absurd and the articles should be construed as providing that a director should leave office if the specified shareholding which got him there ceased to exist. Conteh CJ in the Belize Supreme Court agreed with the government and said that a term allowing the government with its 37.5% stake should be allowed to remove those two directors and appoint new ones. But Carey JA in the Court of Appeal held that there was no \\"necessity\\" in reading in such words. Morrison JA emphasised that art 90(D)(ii) provided for appointment and removal of directors, but nothing for tenure of office, and that therefore Conteh CJ's interpretation could not be \\"derived from the language of the articles.\\" The Attorney General appealed. Advice Giving the advice of the Privy Council, Lord Hoffmann set out the principles for interpretation of a company's articles such as this. He stated that the same principles of interpretation apply whether it is a company's constitution, a contract or an Act of Parliament. A court should search for the meaning of any such document with all relevant contextual facts in mind, and consider the meaning it would convey to a reasonable person. He emphasised it was not relevant, in cases where a gap was left, what the parties hypothetically \\"would have\\" concluded, a hypothetical inquiry which he referred to as \\"barren\\". The important point was to ask what interpretation, and implication would be consistent with the scheme of the company constitution (or contract or Act of Parliament). For this reason, Lord Hoffmann agreed with Conteh CJ that the directors could be removed. The scheme of the privatisation programme was to balance the interests of the government and private investors according to their economic interest. As such, it would have been absurd that just because the special share and the possession of 37.5% of ordinary shares had become disjointed that the incumbent directors would be irremovable. So given the gap in the articles, it was consistent with the scheme of the company's articles that the two directors in question would be appointable by the government. Lord Hoffmann's advice on the law read as follows. Significance The case of AG of Belize v Belize Telecom Ltd has been widely cited as the new and all encompassing statement on implied terms. In Mediterranean Salvage & Towage Ltd v Seamar Trading & Commerce Inc,[2009] EWCA Civ 531, [2009] 1 C.L.C. 909, 913-914 Lord Clarke MR said the following.

Hansa Rostock. Until 1965, Sykora played for TSG Wismar, joining the club aged 12. Here he played ten matches in East Germany's second-tier DDR-Liga. Together with his Wismar teammate Klaus-Peter Stein Sykora celebrated his greatest success, winning the title at the UEFA junior tournament in West Germany in 1965. The East German team beat Portugal, Austria, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia to advance to the final where the underdogs beat England 3‚Äì2 in front of 18,000 spectators in Essen. Between 1964 and 1965 Sykora played in 8 matches with the East German Under-18 national team, until 1969 in another 15 matches for the Under-23 national team. In 1965 Sykora was delegated to the regional footballing center, SC Empor Rostock. His first DDR- Oberliga match was a 4‚Äì0 away win at 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on day 7 of the 1965‚Äì66 season as a center back. Soon thereafter the football department of SC Empor was formed into the football club F.C. Hansa Rostock. Altogether, Sykora played in 12 Oberliga matches in his first season. The following season, he played in 15 Oberliga matches and in the FDGB-Pokal final against BSG Motor Zwickau, losing 0‚Äì3. After a manager change for the 1967‚Äì68 season, Sykora found himself largely sidelined, playing in only 4 matches in the Oberliga and the rest of the season in the reserve team. In consequence, he transferred to 1. FC Magdeburg at the end of the season. His first season with his new club ended with Sykora's only senior club title when he won the 1969 FDGB-Pokal final against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on 1 June 1969. Sykora also appeared in 16 league matches, increasing that number to 23 in the following season. Despite having become a first team regular, he decided to return to Rostock for the 1970‚Äì71 season. Aside from three matches in the DDR-Oberliga, he almost exclusively played in the reserves again, for a total of 18 DDR-Liga matches. After his military service, during which he played for army sports club Vorw√§rts Perleberg, Sykora finally became a regular at Rostock, but had to spend two seasons in the second-tier DDR-Liga when the club was relegated in 1975 and 1977, respectively. Towards the end of his career Sykora played another five years for BSG Schiffahrt und Hafen Rostock in the DDR-Liga. Later he managed Schwaaner Eintracht in the Bezirksklasse Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Life He was the son of William Sedgwick of London, and was born in Bedfordshire about 1610. He matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 2 December 1625 at the age of 15, and graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) 21 June 1628, Oxford Master of Arts (MA Oxon) 4 May 1631. His tutor was George Hughes. On 5 February 1634, he was instituted to the rectory of Farnham, Essex; he held the living of there until 1644, when he was succeeded by Giles Archer (instituted 27 April); but in 1642, leaving Farnham in charge of a curate, he moved to London. On 5 October 1641, a petition was made against William Fuller, dean of Ely and vicar of St Giles-without-Cripplegate, by the parishioners of Cripplegate, complaining that he had hindered the appointment of Sedgwick as Thursday lecturer at St Giles's. In 1642 Sedgwick became chaplain to the regiment of foot raised by William Constable. In 1644 he became the chief preacher in Ely, and by his evangelism gained the title of 'apostle of the Isle of Ely.' He has been classified as a Seeker, and was ready to listen to any claims to prophetic power. A woman in the neighbourhood of Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire, proclaimed the near advent of the day of judgment. Sedgwick adopted her date, and announced it at the house of Francis Russell of Chippenham, Cambridgeshire (father-in-law of Henry Cromwell). Nothing happened on the predicted day, but during the night there was a storm. From this episode, Sedgwick got the name of 'Doomsday Sedgwick.' At the end of 1647, he attended Charles I at Carisbrooke Castle with his Leaves of the Tree of Life. Charles read part of the book and gave it back, saying he thought \\"the author stands in some need of sleep.\\" In 1652 he was attracted by John Reeve, and, without becoming a disciple, supported him until Reeve died. In June 1657, he explained his position in a correspondence with Reeve. His preaching at Ely being terminated by the Restoration, he retired to Lewisham, Kent. In 1663, having conformed, he became rector of Mattishall Burgh, Norfolk, and he died in London about 1669. Works Besides two sermons before Parliament (1642 and 1643), he published: * The Leaves of the Tree of Life, 1648. * Some Flashes of Lightenings of the Sonne of Man, 1648; reprinted 1830. * The Spirituall Madman ... a Prophesie concerning the King, the Parliament, 1648 * Justice upon the Armie Remonstrance, &c.;, 1649. * A Second View of the Army Remonstrance, 1649. * Mr. W.

He played as a midfielder. Football career Born in Wordsley, Staffordshire, Dyson began his football career in the youth system at Birmingham City. In August 1999 he made his first-team debut in the League Cup away at Exeter City, and on 17 December he made his Football League debut, as a half-time substitute, replacing Darren Purse in the Division One match against Wolverhampton Wanderers which Birmingham lost 2‚Äì1. A few days later he made another appearance off the bench. Dyson broke his leg in a training-ground collision with Purse in 1999, a setback which eventually led to his release at the end of the 2000‚Äì01 season. Dyson had a trial at AFC Bournemouth in July 2001, which proved unsuccessful. He joined Hednesford Town of the Southern League Premier Division in November 2001, and scored from the penalty spot on his debut, but was released in February 2002 after failing to achieve regular first-team football. He joined Bromsgrove of the Southern League Western Division in August 2002, and again scored on debut, but after 16 months with the club, he suffered a broken left tibia and fibula as the result of a 50‚Äì50 tackle. His manager described him as \\"a very popular boy and a very important player for us. He's an exceptional footballer and brings a thoughtfulness with everything he tries to do\\", but suggested that after twice breaking his leg he might be wise to consider his future in the game. Dyson resumed his competitive football career nearly three years later, when he joined Stourbridge of the Southern League Midlands Division in October 2006. He played 14 games in all competitions in his first season with the club, and appeared in the playoff final against Leamington through which they won promotion to the Premier Division. In 2009, Dyson was part of the Stourbridge team that lost to former club Hednesford in the final of the Birmingham Senior Cup, and helped the club defeat Football League club Plymouth Argyle to reach the second round proper of the 2011‚Äì12 FA Cup.

It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, taro, bananas and palms which Malinowski's more famous ethnography Argonauts of the Western Pacific briefly mentioned in passing. It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as works of art. In 1988 Alfred Gell called the book \\"still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-magical system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect\\". The book has been described as Malinowski's magnum opus. Overview The book consists of seven parts divided over two volumes. Volume I, The Description of Gardening, contains the introduction and parts one to three, and volume II, The Language of Magic and Gardening, parts four to seven. *Part One: \\"Introduction: Tribal economics and social organisation of the Trobrianders\\" This part introduces the climate, industry, and gardening arrangements of the Trobriands and supplies initial anthropological data on the Trobriand Islanders, including by sketching out their social organization and economic institutions. * Part Two: \\"Gardens and their magic on a coral atoll\\" This part describes the role of magic in Trobriand gardening, the rites it involves, Trobriand theories of land tenure, and the technology and spaces associated with gardening practices. It also considers the methodological limitations of various approaches to ethnographic fieldwork, especially in relation to terminology. * Part Three: \\"Documents and appendices\\" collection of documents, including plans of buildings, lineage and title diagrams, explanations of the calculation of gift obligations, and a set of notes on ethnographic methodology and its limitations. * Part Four: \\"An ethnographic theory of language and some practical corollaries\\" This part considers language as a tool, a document, and a cultural reality. It discusses the difficulties of translation and the overlap and boundaries of concepts, and brings context to bear on interpretation, for the anthropologist and for the speakers. It engages with the question of pragmatics, and of the way meaning relates to words * Part Five: \\"Corpus inscriptionum agriculturae quiriviniensis; or the language of gardens\\" A linguistic supplement, outlining a vocabulary of Trobriand gardening terminology and magical words. * Part Six: \\"An ethnographic theory of the magical word\\" This part advances a theory of magical language, both in the Trobriand case specifically and in general terms. Malinowski argues that Trobriand magic spells, like all forms of language, must be understood in context, as \\"verbal acts\\", with a predominantly pragmatic function. Language, including magical language, is intended primarily not to communicate thought, but to bring about practical effects. This theory of a pragmatic function of language as a functional aspect of human behaviour, is an early anthropological contribution to the theory of pragmatics. * Part Seven: \\"Magical formulae\\" This section presents some Trobriand magical spells, together with Malinowski's word-by-word analysis. Reception The work continues to receive attention from contemporary anthropologists. Its assessment of the Trobriand chief's role as that of a \\"glorified brother-in-law\\" to the whole community is one with which later anthropologists have taken issue. It records unusually extensive ethnolinguistic data for of a work of its time, much of it relating to gardening spells that the Trobriand Islanders used, and much of it incompletely analysed; it continues to provide a data source for anthropologists of language. Malinowski was also praised for his serious engagement with the realities of Trobriand agriculture, its emphasis on its ceremonial aspects notwithstanding, in favour of a simpler, romanticized view. The work is also regarded as a pioneering text in the interdisciplinary study of pragmatics. Its analysis of the context and contents of Trobriand spells was one of the first to bring ethnography to bear on the subject of language. Release details In a letter written around February 1929, Malinowski wrote that he was basing the monograph partly upon a draft manuscript on gardening he had written during 1916 and 1917. The book was published by Routledge in 1935. It has been through several editions, including a 1966 second edition by Allen and Unwin. US editions were published in 1965 and 1978.

It was based on a play by Walter C. Hackett. The film was made at Welwyn Studios. Synopsis In the 1780s, after an evening of illegal gambling, two of the participants fight a duel in which the wronged party is killed by a villain, who has just cheated to win a newly built house at Hyde Park Corner from him. Officer Cheatle of the Bow Street Runners is able to arrest those present for gambling, but is unable to prove that a murder has occurred. A hundred and fifty years later, the Officer's great-grandson, Constable Cheatle, is intrigued by reports of another murder at the same house at Hyde Park Corner. Cheatle sees this as a way of fulfilling his ambition to join the plainclothes detective branch. His attempts to solve the case are initially interrupted by Sophie, a petty criminal whom he arrests while she is shoplifting in a department store. Eventually, with her help, he is able to uncover the true culprit of the crime that has its roots in the fatal evening in the eighteenth century.

The Education Act 1902 established grounds requiring the formation of a Local Education Authority responsible for the development and maintenance of schools within the Local Authority, superseding the School Board. Between 1902 and 1988 St Helens LEA was responsible for monitoring and developing all the Boroughs schools and learning centres from pre-school through to Further Education establishments. The 1902 provision granted purview to monitor and provide overview to Religious Education establishments. The Education Reform Act 1988 relieved the LEA of its duties over Further Education establishments. St Helens Polytechnic / College became a corporation at that point. The Children Act 2004 required the formation of the a Director of Children's Services, drawing the Children's Services and LEA operating services fully under the umbrella of the Local Authority and abolishing references to an LEA. The modern role of the education authority in St Helens The Council provides many services with regards to the operation of the schools within the borough working closely with the schools in the formation of Governing Bodies.

His practice spanned a broad range of media, including painting, sculpture, photography, neon, video, drawing, printmaking, installation art, mixed media and performance.  Study and autodidact  He was born in Ghent, and studied at the Secondary Art Institute (SSKI) of Ghent. A successful and fruitful artistic - cultural educational experiment in the early 1970s that has been disbanded at the end of that decade. Due to the high artistic and general cultural level of the secondary cycle, like other fellow students, Debaere had problems to fit in the next higher cycle. Despite the three years of intensive classic and contemporary artistic training he is largely considered as an autodidact.  Guest lecturer at Brussels Saint Lucas Institute and artist in residence in Wiesbaden  Debaere was guest lecturer at the Hogeschool Sint- Lukas Brussels, Well known is the invitation to Wiesbaden, where he collaborated with his friend, the artist and his former teacher Danny Matthys. They were both 'artist in residence' in the local zoo. Debaere discovered the working with elephant - excrements at that moment.  S.M.A.K.  Debaere has an important artistic legacy, located largely in Ghent SMAK, shortly after his sudden and totally unexpected death there in 1994. There were only 15 years between his first exhibition and death. He was only discovered shortly before his death (and then carefully). But that was sufficient for a massively attended funeral ceremony. In 1995 Knight Jan Hoet, the local Belgian star - curator of 'Chambres D'Amis', Documenta IX in 1992 at Kassel and 'Over the Edges', set up a first (summary) - exhibition in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Ghent, in honor of Hugo Debaere, in 1995.  Work  Hugo Debaere tried to link his personal visual world to items such as the ancient cultures and his love for and deep knowledge of contemporary Africa. Hugo Debaere is related to the freedom of figurative sculptures known motifs looking like a giant breast, a cigarette-smoking squatting figure, a crushed foam elephant, a tire - snake or the 'Nose of Africa. \\" These images include modeled cow manure, without the suggestion of spectacle. The primary way in which he reflected impressions and thoughts on the possible significance of art for an individual, is unusual. Peaux Allumees is a typical sculpture of Debaere. The method of recovering the material is like a red thread through the production of sculptural Debaere.  Nauman  The work of the contemporary American artist Bruce Nauman had some strong influence on some of his work and on his life. During youth and early artist years Kazimir Malevich and Arthur Rimbaud were important. In the 1990s Georges Bataille got strong influences.

Biography  Temmerman has worked in various locations around the world for the health and rights of women and children. Most of her work is in the academic and political international arena, particularly in collaboration with United Nations organizations, such as WHO and UNFPA, as well as the European Union, the African Union, national governments in Europe and Africa, as well as with media and civil society. Temmerman's diverse skills in academics, science, management and politics, in conjunction with her work in the area of women, children and adolescents' health and rights, led The Lancet to call her \\"a polymath in reproductive health\\". Her advocacy efforts for women's health and rights inspired the Irish rock band U2, during their concert on 1 August 2017 in the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels, to include her in the list of inspiring women (\\"Women of the World Unite\\") who were put in the spotlight during the song \\"Ultra Violet (Light My Way)\\". = Professional career = Temmerman studied Medicine at Ghent University in Belgium. This choice was primarily made out of social engagement. Her first contact with Africa during an internship in Butare, Rwanda, in 1975 raised her interest in the health and rights of women living in low- and middle-income countries.  Early career  Trained in obstetrics and gynaecology, tropical medicine and public health, Temmerman was a junior researcher in the 1980s and later a research leader and mentor.

She lived in Kenya from 1986 to 1992.  Ghent University and the International Centre of Reproductive Health  Back in Belgium in 1992, Temmerman founded the International Centre for Reproductive Health (ICRH) at Ghent University, which has sister research organizations in Kenya (ICRHK) and Mozambique (ICRHM) and a large global collaborative academic network. ICRH obtained research funding from the European Commission, the Belgian development cooperation (DGD, BTC]), the Flemish development cooperation (VLIR, FICA), the Special Research Fund (BOF) of Ghent University and other organizations. Many of these research activities took place in sub-Saharan Africa and involved implementation research on a broad range of sexual and reproductive health issues, including HIV/AIDS. In addition, research collaborations were set up with other European countries, China, India, Central and Latin America, Australia and the Russian Federation. ICRH is a WHO Collaborating Centre on Reproductive Health since 2004, and a UNFPA preferential partner. Since 1995, she has been a full professor of OB/GYN at Ghent University in Belgium, currently with leave of absence. During her over 30 years of clinical work as an obstetrician she supervised over 18,000 births in many parts of the world.

It draws partly on academic research by Tannen and others, but was regarded by academics with some controversy upon its release. It was written for a popular audience, and uses anecdotes from literature and the lives of Tannen and her family, students and friends. Tannen writes that, from childhood, boys and girls learn different approaches to language and communication; she calls these different approaches \\"genderlects\\". According to Tannen, females engage in \\"rapport-talk\\" ‚Äî a communication style meant to promote social affiliation and emotional connection, while men engage in \\"report-talk\\" ‚Äî a style focused on exchanging information with little emotional import. The differences in metamessages, Tannen claims, result in misunderstandings between men and women. The book remained on the New York Times best seller list for nearly four years (eight months at #1) and was subsequently translated into 30 other languages. It received generally positive reviews, and some readers have even credited it with helping save their relationships. However, another linguist has criticized Tannen's representation of the research she cites as limited and misleading, faulting her for making generalizations and contradictory claims. Summary Tannen's chapters, which are broken up into short titled sections of two or three pages, start by distinguishing what men and women seek from conversations: independence and intimacy respectively. This leads to conversations at cross- purposes, since both parties may miss the other's metamessages, with attendant misunderstandings‚Äîfor example, a woman complaining about the lingering effects of a medical procedure, who may merely be seeking empathy from female friends by doing so, becomes angry at her husband when he suggests a solution involving further surgery. Men and women both perceive the other gender as the more talkative, and they are both accurate, since studies show men speak more in public settings about public topics while women dominate private conversation within and about relationships. The latter is frequently derided as gossip by both genders, and Tannen devotes an entire chapter to exploring its social functions as a way of connecting speaker and listener to a larger group. Men often dominate conversations in public, even where they know less about a subject than a female interlocutor, because they use conversation to establish status. Women, on the other hand, often listen more because they have been socialized to be accommodating. These patterns, which begin in childhood, mean, for instance, that men are far more likely to interrupt another speaker, and not to take it personally when they are themselves interrupted, while women are more likely to finish each other's sentences. These patterns have paradoxical effects. Men use the language of conflict to create connections, and conversely women can use the language of connection to create conflict. \\"Women and men are inclined to understand each other in terms of their own styles because we assume we all live in the same world.\\"Tannen, 179. If the genders would keep this in mind and adjust accordingly, Tannen believes, much discord between them could be averted. Reception The book was well received by major media outlets. The New York Times called it \\"a refreshing and readable account of the complexities of communication between men and women.\\" You Just Don't Understand \\"goes a long way toward explaining why perfectly wonderful men and women behave in ways that baffle their partners,\\" said Judy Mann in The Washington Post. During its four years on the Times' bestseller list, it spent eight months at the top. Tannen chose to interrupt her teaching and researching career to do book tours and appear on talk shows. Many readers thanked her for saving their marriages. Criticism At a 1992 conference on women and language, Montclair State University linguistics professor Alice Freed gave an extended critique of You Just Don't Understand. \\"Its popularity and overwhelming acclaim are both astonishing and troubling,\\" she began. \\"[A]n otherwise well-respected linguist has publicly and successfully promulgated a theoretical framework that is widely disputed within the academic community.\\" Tannen's book, Freed says, \\"simultaneously perpetuates negative stereotypes of women, excuses men their interactive failings, and distorts by omission the accumulated knowledge of our discipline.\\" While Tannen accurately cites the factual findings of one researcher on the development of linguistic interaction among children, she uses them to support notions of intrinsic gender difference whereas the actual research finds greater similarities. Her readable anecdotes support unjustified generalizations that fail to take ethnic differences into account. \\"As an American Jewish woman married to an Irish American man,\\" says Freed, \\"the constellation of conversational traits that I live with is completely at odds with those described by Tannen.\\" She also points out that men and women are able to communicate with each other quite well when courting. Freed also says Tannen draws different conclusions from the same anecdotes in her scholarly work. In one she uses in both a scholarly article and her book, a man interrupts a joke his wife has begun telling to finish it for her. The article explains the man's behavior as a display of dominance, while the book simply suggests the two have different understandings.

It is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. Etymology For its name various versions exist that have stood the test of time. One of them claims that it took its name from the two kingdoms that existed in the region. Another version is because it faces two hills (mountains). A third version notes that owes its name from two streams that flowed to the ground, while a fourth says it was so named because it was in ancient times, the hill of the father of the Olympian Gods, Zeus.Whichever the version one thing is certain: that Diorios is a very beautiful and enchanting village of Kyrenia. Location and history Located in a magnificent natural setting on the south side of the plateau of Myrtou, in dense forests that spread throughout the village and joined by a magical way with the sea of Agia Eirini all the way up to Kormakitis. Diorios was a mixed village (Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots) which has excellent views of the Bay of Morphou, the mountain of old Epia, the port of Xeros and ancient Solon. Diorios is known to date for the unique, red tulips. The vegetation of the Cyprus tulip ¬´Tulipa Cypria¬ª or \\"laledes\\" by the locals, where flourish in abundant quantities during the months of March and April, is characteristic of the region. Diorios village From a geological point of view, the administrative area of the village is dominated by sandstones, flysch of Kythrea and to a lesser extent, alluvial deposits, especially along the river basins of the region. On the deposits, were developed xerorentzines and territories terraroza . The average annual rainfall in the village area is reached by the homonymous state forest. In the remaining areas were before 1974 mainly cereals, carob and olive trees. Diorios' population increased from 1881 until 1946. In 1881 the inhabitants numbered 387 and increased to 432 in 1891. In 1911 the inhabitants were 614 (402 Greeks and 212 Turks), while in 1946 amounted to 795 (517 Greeks, 271 Turks and 7 others). In the next census in 1956, a decrease of inhabitants numbered 622 (374 Greeks, 246 Turks and 2 others). Later there was increasing again in 1960 the villagers were 873 (514 Greeks and 359 Turks). The Turkish villagers abandoned it in 1964, because of the hostilities between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. In 1973, the Greek population of the village numbered 600 inhabitants. After the village was captured by Turkish troops during the invasion in the summer of 1974, many Turkish Cypriots returned to their village, and later many settlers from Turkey settled there under the Turkish plan for demographic change in the occupied areas of Cyprus. A few Greek Cypriots had remained trapped in their village after the Turkish invasion. They were only 16 people in October 1975 and they were forced to leave Diorios, following all the other Greek refugees. In September 1976 the last of the Greek villagers was expelled. The village church dedicated to Agia Marina, was built in 1850 over an older church. In 1973 worked the new church of St. Marina in another village location. The old church was damaged during the invasion of 1974 and is in ruins till now, the newer temple located in a military area said was used as a hospital. Other chapels of the village is St. John, Prophet Zachariah, St. Black, Prophet Elias, Archangel Michael, St. George (Mahania forest area), St. George (Trimithias area) of the Holy Cross, and Agiopetras St. Nicholas.

Hammer. It premiered in the United States on HBO. Plot Karl Savak, a \\"rogue FBI agent\\", is attempting to steal and sell military weapons. When stealing weaponry, one of Savak's henchmen, Marcus, kills Darlene and Marianne North, the wife and daughter of Army Staff Sgt. John North. North himself is shot and lapses into a coma for eight weeks. When he regains consciousness he discovers that Savak has put Marcus onto a witness protection program. As a result, North decides to enact his own justice and seeks revenge on Savak and his henchmen. At the end, it's revealed that Savak was the one behind the murders of North's family and he avenges them when he throws him off a roof and onto a piano, killing him.

Allen Cornstead *Clifton Collins Jr. as Jarhead Reception The Bosworth vehicle has received mixed reviews. Christopher Armstead stated that one problem with the film was that 'the story they...was all over the freaking place'. Nonetheless, Armstead thought that 'Jeff Kober was in his element playing a slimy, no good, back stabbing villain' and that Bruce Payne's character, Karl Savak, is one of the most 'entertaining movie villains in low budget action flick history'. Armstead stated that 'so awesome is Karl Savak that some lunatic has created a Facebook page in his honor'. Another reviewer stated that Stone Cold 'may be Brian Bosworth‚Äôs finest hour, but One Man‚Äôs Justice is a fitting encore' and that 'Bruce Payne, with his Whitesnake hair and nose ring is slimeball perfection as the villain'. A different reviewer described the film as a 'slice of red-blooded American Macho' and stated that it 'is the finest hour of Payne‚Äôs storied career, and he dutifully gives One Tough Bastard an energising kick to the Boz'. Another reviewer stated that the film contained some good performances, with 'Bosworth kicking some ass and showing some maturity in his second acting gig' but that 'when it's all said and done, it's Bruce Payne's villain that really makes the film what it is'. Jedadiah Leland stated that the film was 'a dumb but fun movie that‚Äôs enlivened by three actors [Bosworth, Payne and Kober] who know how to be convincingly tough on camera'. Robb Antequera stated that 'while the plot is standard action movie plot, the well handled/fast paced action, the compelling story, and the great cast & characters really help elevate the movie beyond its low budget origins'. Antequera also commented that the movie was a 'must watch' due to Payne's performance as Savak, which he stated deserved to be mentioned among other great villainous performances in action movies, such as Gavan O'Herlihy's portrayal of Manny Fraker in Death Wish 3, Vernon Wells' portrayal of Bennett in Commando. Alan Rickman's portrayal of Hans Gruber in Die Hard and John Lithgow's portrayal of Eric Qualen in Cliffhanger.

Early life and education Mike Breault was born in Central Falls, Rhode Island on May 28, 1958. As a young child, Breault lived in the Boston and Cape Cod areas, but his family moved to Warwick, Rhode Island when he began grade school. Breault developed an interest in science fiction and fantasy early in his childhood, and read The Hobbit at age eight. Breault commented: \\"I didn‚Äôt read the trilogy for three more years. I was afraid I wouldn't like it as much. I was right, but I still enjoyed it.\\" Breault developed an interest in astronomy in high school, later earning a degree in physics and an astronomy minor from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 1980. Breault was introduced to fantasy gaming at the end of his freshman year at RPI: \\"I joined a game club that had about 40 people in it. We played lots of D&D; games, miniatures games, and Diplomacy. However, disaster struck the club in my sophomore year ‚Äî about half the club flunked out of school because they played games so much. The real hard-core players played all weekend and several hours each night. They were bound to flunk out.\\" Breault attended Indiana University's graduate Astronomy program from 1980 through 1984. As an associate instructor, Breault also taught astronomy courses on television that were broadcast to the regional campuses of Indiana University. Breault met Mary Elsbury at the university in 1982, and a couple of years later, they were married. During grad school, Breault spent a year as an editorial intern for The American Spectator. Career In 1984, Breault noticed an ad in the Chicago Tribune for a position on the editorial staff at TSR, Inc., \\"Mary and I were at Marriott's Great America [an amusement park north of Chicago] and picked up a copy of the newspaper. The classifieds had the TSR ad, so I immediately put my resume together, and I was hired in September of that year.\\" In late July 1986, the Breaults' first child, Christopher Michael Breault was born. On January 3, 1989, their second child, Amelia Katherine Breault, was born. Breault edited first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons books including Oriental Adventures, Dungeoneer's Survival Guide, and the original Manual of the Planes, as well as most of the early Dragonlance adventure modules. He also edited the second edition Player's Handbook. Breault and Jim Ward designed The Book of Lairs. In 1988, Breault co-designed the original Pool of Radiance computer game. In five years at TSR, he wrote, edited, and developed over 100 games, modules, and hardback books. Breault left TSR in 1989 to start a freelance career. Initially continuing work with TSR, Breault gradually shifted over into computer and video games. His video game work started with re-writing the translated script, and writing the included hint-book for the 1989 Sega Genesis game Sword of Vermilion, as well as other role-playing games for the Genesis, plus Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves for the NES, among other games and platforms. His freelance career spanned 10 years, from 1989 to 1998, living with his family (plus hypoallergenic dog Rags) in Warsaw, Indiana. In 1999, he was hired by Volition, Inc. in Champaign, IL as a writer and designer for their computer games.

Frederick Wood (21 January 1884 ‚Äì 15 July 1924) was an Australian rugby union player, a state and national representative half-back. He was vice-captain of the Wallabies on their first overseas tour in 1908‚Äì09 and later captained the side in Test matches in 1910 and 1914. His representative career lasted from 1905 to 1914. __TOC__ Early club and representative career Wood played for the Glebe club in Sydney and first attracted attention when he represented in a 1905 Metropolitan (Sydney) side against the touring New Zealand side. He was then selected in the second match for New South Wales against those same All Blacks. A full Australian team was selected the next day ‚Äì the first national side to tour overseas and Wood was selected at half-back in the 1905 side captained by Stan Wickham which toured New Zealand. Wood played in four tour matches of the seven contested by the side, but did not figure in the sole Test.Howell, p59 In 1907, Wood was selected for New South Wales to meet the visiting All Blacks and played two matches alongside Chris McKivat in the halves with the first a narrow loss and the second a 14‚Äì0 victory to the Waratahs. Both McKivat and Wood were selected in the Australian test side captained by Peter Burge to meet those same All Blacks but the Wallabies were well-beaten 6‚Äì26. Woods held his spot for the 2nd Test (a loss to Australia) and the 3rd (a 5-all draw).Howell, p60 In 1908 an Anglo-Welsh side toured Australia and Wood was honoured with the state captaincy for New South Wales in the first of the two encounters he played against them. Wallaby tourist Wood was selected as vice-captain on the first Wallaby 1908‚Äì09 Australia rugby union tour of the British Isles and France, the squad captained by Herbert Moran. Wood and Joshua Stevenson were the selected halfbacks but with Stevenson injured in the fifth tour game the selectors were forced to look at other halves combinations amongst Chris McKivatt, Arthur McCabe and Ward Prentice who were also in the squad. Wood was unavailable with injury for a run of five games and McKivatt seized the opportunity with both hands and played in both Tests at half-back and captained the side in the Olympic gold medal bout against Cornwall. Moran later in Viewless Winds referred to the friction that arose since Wood as vice-captain was also a selector \\"The vice-captain was great little player who never found his form in England. It used to be unpleasant for us when, in the face of this, he insisted for a long time on his own selection. We did not want unfriendliness, but for nine [sic, in truth seven] matches in succession he kept McKivat out of his proper position\\"Moran, Herbert (1939) Viewless Winds reproduced in The Spirit of Rugbyp179 However it was no disgrace to be playing second fiddle to McKivat and in any case following his recovery from injury Wood played another thirteen games, seven of them as captain and finished with a total tour tally of twenty appearances. When the Wallabies returned to Australia McKivatt and thirteen others of the squad moved to the ranks of the new professional code of rugby league and Wood resumed his place as the top half-back for New South Wales. Wood played against the touring All Blacks of 1910 twice for New South Wales and in all three Test matches. That second test marked Australia's first ever victory over New Zealand in the seven encounters till then.Howell p61 Wood played against the New Zealand MƒÅori rugby union team when they toured against New South Wales in 1910 and in 1913. That same year the Wallabies undertook a nine match tour of New Zealand with Wood playing in eight of those games. Wood played in all three Tests and Howell quotes the Chester McMillan reference (The Visitors) that in both the second and third Tests \\"Wood was the outstanding back on the field\\". In 1914 aged 30 Wood was still representing for Australia when the All Blacks toured against and he was honoured with the captaincy of the national team in the first and third Tests. World War I marked the end of international rugby for a while as it also marked the end of Wood's long representative career having played 39 times for Australia including 12 Tests.

It took place over 18 days in May 1940 and ended with the German occupation of Belgium following the surrender of the Belgian Army. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium under the operational plan Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). The Allied armies attempted to halt the German Army in Belgium, believing it to be the main German thrust. After the French had fully committed the best of the Allied armies to Belgium between 10 and 12 May, the Germans enacted the second phase of their operation, a break-through, or sickle cut, through the Ardennes, and advanced toward the English Channel. The German Army (Heer) reached the Channel after five days, encircling the Allied armies. The Germans gradually reduced the pocket of Allied forces, forcing them back to the sea. The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May 1940, ending the battle. The Battle of Belgium included the first tank battle of the war, the Battle of Hannut. It was the largest tank battle in history at the time but was later surpassed by the battles of the North African Campaign and the Eastern Front. The battle also included the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael, the first strategic airborne operation using paratroopers ever attempted. The German official history stated that in the 18 days of bitter fighting, the Belgian Army were tough opponents, and spoke of the \\"extraordinary bravery\\" of its soldiers. The Belgian collapse forced the Allied withdrawal from continental Europe. The British Royal Navy subsequently evacuated Belgian ports during Operation Dynamo, allowing the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), along with many Belgian and French soldiers, to escape capture and continue military operations. France reached its own armistice with Germany in June 1940. Belgium was occupied by the Germans until the autumn of 1944, when it was liberated by the Western Allies. Pre-battle plans =Belgium's strained alliances= Heysel, near Brussels, in 1936 The Belgian strategy for a defence against German aggression faced political as well as military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian‚ÄìGerman border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there. Politically, the Belgians did not trust the French. Marshal Philippe P√©tain had suggested a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war as a result of the French‚ÄìSoviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland. The Belgians much preferred an alliance with the United Kingdom. The British had entered the First World War in response to the German violation of Belgian neutrality. The Belgian Channel ports had offered the German Imperial Navy valuable bases, and such an attack would offer the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe bases to engage in strategic offensive operations against the United Kingdom in the coming conflict. But the British government paid little attention to the concerns of the Belgians. The lack of this commitment ensured the Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the day before the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The lack of opposition to the remilitarisation served to convince the Belgians that France and Britain were unwilling to fight for their own strategic interests, let alone Belgium's. The Belgian General Staff was determined to fight for its own interests, alone if necessary. =Belgian place in Allied strategy= King Leopold III, Belgian head of state, who was partisan of the policy of neutrality The French were infuriated at King Leopold III's open declaration of neutrality in October 1936. The French Army saw its strategic assumptions undermined; it could no longer expect closer cooperation with the Belgians in defending the latter's eastern borders, enabling a German attack to be checked well forward of the French border. The French were dependent on how much cooperation they could extract from the Belgians. Such a situation deprived the French any prepared defences in Belgium to forestall an attack, a situation which the French had wanted to avoid as it meant engaging the German Panzer Divisions in a mobile battle. The French considered invading Belgium immediately in response to a German attack on the country. The Belgians, recognising the danger posed by the Germans, secretly made their own defence policies, troop movement information, communications, fixed defence dispositions, intelligence and air reconnaissance arrangements available to the French military attach√© in Brussels. The Allied plan to aid Belgium was the Dyle Plan; the cream of the Allied forces, which included the French armoured divisions, would advance to the Dyle river in response to a German invasion. The choice of an established Allied line lay in either reinforcing the Belgians in the east of the country, at the Meuse‚ÄìAlbert Canal line, and holding the Scheldt Estuary, thus linking the French defences in the south with the Belgian forces protecting Ghent and Antwerp, seemed to be the soundest defensive strategy. The weakness of the plan was that, politically at least, it abandoned most of eastern Belgium to the Germans. Militarily it would put the Allied rear at right angles to the French frontier defences; while for the British, their communications located at the Bay of Biscay ports, would be parallel to their front. Despite the risk of committing forces to central Belgium and an advance to the Schedlt or Dyle lines, which would be vulnerable to an outflanking move, Maurice Gamelin, the French commander, approved the plan and it remained the Allied strategy upon the outbreak of war. The British, with no army in the field and behind in rearmament, was in no position to challenge French strategy, which had assumed the prominent role of the Western Alliance. Having little ability to oppose the French, the British strategy for military action came in the form of strategic bombing of the Ruhr industry. =Belgian military strategy= Leopold III, Belgium's monarch from 1934, reviewing Belgian troops in early 1940 Upon the official Belgian withdrawal from the Western Alliance, the Belgians refused to engage in any official staff meetings with the French or British military staff for fear of compromising its neutrality. The Belgians did not regard a German invasion as inevitable and were determined that if an invasion did take place it would be effectively resisted by new fortifications such as Eben Emael. The Belgians had taken measures to reconstruct their defences along the border with the German state upon Adolf Hitler's rise to power in January 1933. The Belgian government had watched with increasing alarm the German withdrawal from the League of Nations, its repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles and its violation of the Locarno Treaties. The government increased expenditure on modernising the fortifications at Namur and Li√®ge. New lines of defence were established along the Maastricht‚ÄìBois-le-Duc canal, joining the Meuse, Scheldt and the Albert Canal. The protection of the eastern frontier, based mainly on the destruction of a number of roads, was entrusted to new formations (frontier cyclist units and the newly formed Chasseurs Ardennais). By 1935, the Belgian defences had been completed. Even so, it was felt that the defences were no longer adequate. A significant mobile reserve was needed to guard the rear areas, and as a result it was considered that the protection against a sudden assault by German forces was not sufficient. Significant manpower reserves were also needed, but a bill made for the provision of longer military service and training for the army was rejected by the public on the basis that it would increase Belgium's military commitments as well as the request of the Allies to engage in conflicts far from home. King Leopold III made a speech on 14 October 1936 in front of the Council of Ministers, in an attempt to persuade the people (and its Government) that the defences needed strengthening. He outlined three main military points for Belgium's increased rearmament: > a) German rearmament, following upon the complete re-militarisation of Italy > and Russia (the Soviet Union), caused most other states, even those that > were deliberately pacifistic, like Switzerland and the Netherlands, to take > exceptional precautions. > b) There has been such a vast change in the methods of warfare as a result > of technical progress, particularly in aviation and mechanization, that the > initial operations of armed conflict could now be of such force, speed and > magnitude as to be particularly alarming to small countries like Belgium. > c) Our anxieties have been increased by the lightning reoccupation of the > Rhineland and the fact that bases for the start of a possible German > invasion have been moved near to our frontier. On 24 April 1937, the French and British delivered a public declaration that Belgium's security was paramount to the Western Allies and that they would defend their frontiers accordingly against aggression of any sort, whether this aggression was directed solely at Belgium, or as a means of obtaining bases from which to wage war against \\"other states\\". The British and French, under those circumstances, released Belgium from her Locarno obligations to render mutual assistance in the event of German aggression toward Poland, while the British and French maintained their military obligations to Belgium. Militarily, the Belgians considered the Wehrmacht to be stronger than the Allies, particular the British Army, and engaging in overtures to the Allies would result in Belgium becoming a battleground without adequate allies. The Belgians and French remained confused about what was expected of each other if or when hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin. As far as the Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of the limited Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces for use as a strategic reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments. On 10 January 1940, in an episode known as the Mechelen Incident, a German Army Major Hellmuth Reinberger crash-landed in a Messerschmitt Bf 108 near Mechelen-aan- de-Maas. Reinberger was carrying the first plans for the German invasion of western Europe which, as Gamelin had expected, entailed a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan and a German thrust through Belgium (which was expanded by the Wehrmacht to include the Netherlands) and into France. The Belgians suspected a ruse, but the plans were taken seriously. Belgian intelligence and the military attach√© in Cologne correctly suggested the Germans would not commence the invasion with this plan. It suggested that the Germans would try an attack through the Belgian Ardennes and advance to Calais with the aim of encircling the Allied armies in Belgium. The Belgians had correctly predicted the Germans would attempt a Kesselschlacht (literally \\"Cauldron battle\\", meaning encirclement), to destroy its enemies. The Belgians had predicted the exact German plan as offered by Erich von Manstein. The Belgian High Command warned the French and British of their concerns. They feared that the Dyle plan would put not just the Belgian strategic position in danger, but also the entire left wing of the Allied front. King Leopold and General Raoul Van Overstraeten, the King's Aide de Camp, warned Gamelin and the French Army Command of their concerns on 8 March and 14 April. They were ignored. =Belgian plans for defensive operations= Eben-Emael: the Belgians hoped to severely delay the Germans using such fortifications The Belgian plan, in the event of German aggression [italics in original] provided for: > (a) A delaying position along the Albert Canal from Antwerp to Li√®ge and the > Meuse from Li√®ge to Namur, which was to be held long enough to allow French > and British troops to occupy the line Antwerp‚ÄìNamur‚ÄìGivet. It was > anticipated that the forces of the guarantor Powers would be in action on > the third day of an invasion. > (b) Withdrawal to the Antwerp‚ÄìNamur position. > (c) The Belgian Army was to hold the sector‚Äìexcluding Leuven, but including > Antwerp‚Äìas part of the main Allied defensive position. In an agreement with the British and French Armies, the French 7th Army under the command of Henri Giraud was to advance into Belgium, past the Scheldt Estuary in Zeeland if possible, to Breda, in the Netherlands. The British Army's British Expeditionary Force or BEF, commanded by General John Vereker, Lord Gort, was to occupy the central position in the Brussels‚ÄìGhent gap supporting the Belgian Army holding the main defensive positions some east of Brussels. The main defensive position ringing Antwerp would be protected by the Belgians, barely from the city. The French 7th Army was to reach the Zeeland or Breda, just inside the Dutch border. The French would then be in a position to protect the left flank of the Belgian Army forces protecting Antwerp and threaten the German northern flank. Further east, delaying positions were constructed in the immediate tactical zones along the Albert Canal, which joined with the defences of the Meuse west of Maastricht. The line deviated southward, and continued to Liege. The Maastricht‚ÄìLi√®ge gap was heavily protected. Fort Eben-Emael guarded the city's northern flank, the tank country lying in the strategic depths of the Belgian forces occupying the city and the axis of advance into the west of the country. Further lines of defence ran south west, covering the Liege‚ÄìNamur axis. The Belgian Army also had the added benefit of the French 1st Army, advancing toward Gembloux and Hannut, on the southern flank of the BEF and covering the Sambre sector. This covered the gap in the Belgian defences between the main Belgian positions on the Dyle line with Namur to the south. Further south still, the French 9th Army advanced to the Givet‚ÄìDinant axis on the Meuse river. The French 2nd Army was responsible for the last of front, covering Sedan, the lower Meuse, the Belgian‚ÄìLuxembourg border and the northern flank of the Maginot line. =German operational plans= Map of the area between Belgium and the Netherlands near Fort Eben-Emael: The fort protected the vital strategic bridgeheads into Belgium The German plan of attack required that Army Group B would advance and draw in the Allied First Army Group into central Belgium, while Army Group A conducted the surprise assault through the Ardennes. Belgium was to act as a secondary front with regard to importance. Army Group B was given only limited numbers of armoured and mobile units while the vast majority of the Army Group comprised infantry divisions. After the English Channel was reached, all Panzer division units and most motorised infantry were removed from Army Group B and given to Army Group A, to strengthen the German lines of communication and to prevent an Allied breakout. Such a plan would still fail if sufficient ground could not be taken quickly in Belgium to squeeze the allies against two fronts. Preventing this from happening were the defences of Fort Eben-Emael and the Albert Canal. The three bridges over the canal were the key to allowing Army Group B a high operational tempo. The bridges at Veldwezelt, Vroenhoven and Kanne in Belgium, and Maastricht on the Dutch border were the target. Failure to capture the bridges would leave Reichenau's German 6th Army, the southernmost army of Group B, trapped in the Maastricht-Albert Canal enclave and subjected to the fire of Eben-Emael. The fort had to be captured or destroyed. Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) to discuss the assault. It was first suggested that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and were likely to be vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti- aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300 metres alone. Hitler had noticed one potential flaw in the defences. The roofs were flat and unprotected; he demanded to know if a glider, such as the DFS 230, could land on them. Student replied that it could be done, but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this would deliver 80‚Äì90 paratroopers onto the target. Hitler then revealed the tactical weapon that would make this strategic operation work, introducing the Hohlladungwaffe (hollow-charge) ‚Äì a explosive weapon which would destroy the Belgian gun emplacements. It was this tactical unit that would spearhead the first strategic airborne operation in history. Forces involved =Belgian forces= Belgian soldiers resting at the roadside The Belgian Army could muster 22 divisions, which contained 1,338 artillery pieces but just 10 AMC 35 tanks. However, the Belgian combat vehicles included 200 T-13 tank destroyers. These had an excellent 47 mm antitank gun and a coaxial FN30 machine gun in a turret. The Belgians also possessed 42 T-15s. They were officially described as armoured cars but were actually fully tracked tanks with a 13.2 mm turret machine gun. The standard Belgian anti-tank gun was the 47 mm FRC, towed either by trucks or by fully tracked armoured Utilitie B-tractors. One report states that a round from a 47 mm gun went straight through a Sd kfz 231 and penetrated the armour of the Panzer IV behind it. These Belgian guns were better than the 25 mm and 37 mm guns of respectively the French and the Germans. The Belgians began mobilisation on 25 August 1939 and by May 1940 mounted a field army of 18 infantry divisions, two divisions of partly motorised Chasseurs Ardennais and two motorised cavalry divisions, a force totaling some 600,000 men. Belgian reserves may have been able to field 900,000 men. The army lacked armour and anti-aircraft guns. After the completion of the Belgian Army's mobilisation, it could muster five Regular Corps and two reserve Army Corps consisting of 12 regular infantry divisions, two divisions of Chasseurs Ardennais, six reserve infantry divisions, one brigade of Cyclist Frontier Guards, one Cavalry Corps of two divisions, and one brigade of motorised cavalry. The Army contained two anti-aircraft artillery and four artillery regiments, and an unknown number of fortress, engineer, and signals force personnel. The Belgian Naval Corps (Corps de Marine) was resurrected in 1939. Most of the Belgian merchant fleet, some 100 ships, evaded capture by the Germans. Under the terms of a Belgian‚ÄìRoyal Navy agreement, these ships and their 3,350 crewmen were placed under British control for the duration of hostilities. The General Headquarters of the Belgian Admiralty was at Ostend under the command of Major Henry Decarpentrie. The First Naval Division was based at Ostend, while the Second and Third divisions were based at Zeebrugge and Antwerp. A Fairey Fox of the A√©ronautique Militaire Belge The A√©ronautique Militaire Belge (Belgian Air Force - A√©MI) had barely begun to modernise their aircraft technology. The A√©MI had ordered Brewster Buffalo, Fiat CR.42, and Hawker Hurricane fighters, Koolhoven F.K.56 trainers, Fairey Battle and Caproni Ca.312 light bombers, and Caproni Ca.335 fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, but only the Fiats, Hurricanes, and Battles had been delivered. The shortage of modern types meant single-seat versions of the Fairey Fox light bomber were being used as fighters. The A√©MI possessed 250 combat aircraft. At least 90 were fighters, 12 were bombers and 12 were reconnaissance aircraft. Only 50 were of reasonably modern standard. When liaison and transport aircraft from all services are included, the total strength was 377; however only 118 of these were serviceable on 10 May 1940. Of this number around 78 were fighters and 40 were bombers. The A√©MI was commanded by Paul Hiernaux, who had received his pilot's license just before the outbreak of World War I, and had risen to the position of Commander-in-Chief in 1938. Hiernaux organised the service into three R√©giments d'A√©ronautique (air regiments): the 1er with 60 aircraft, the 2√®me with 53 aircraft, and the 3√®me with 79 aircraft. =French forces= The SOMUA S35 tank was considered one of the most modern types in French service at the time The Belgians were afforded substantial support by the French Army. The French 1st Army included General Ren√© Prioux's Cavalry Corps. The Corps was given the 2nd Light Mechanized Division (2e Division L√©g√®re M√©canique, or 2e DLM) and the 3rd Light Mechanized Division (3e DLM), which were allocated to defend the Gembloux gap. The armoured forces consisted of 176 of the formidable SOMUA S35s and 239 Hotchkiss H35 light tanks. Both of these types, in armour and firepower, were superior to most German types. The 3e DLM contained 90 S35s and some 140 H35s alone. The French 7th Army was assigned to protect the northernmost part of the Allied front. It contained the 1st Light Mechanized Division (1re DLM), the 25th Motorised Infantry Division (25e Division d'Infanterie Motoris√©e, or 25e DIM) and the 9th Motorised Infantry Division (9e DIM). This force would advance to Breda in the Netherlands. The third French army to see action on Belgian soil was the 9th. It was weaker than both the 7th and the 1st Armies. The 9th Army was allocated infantry divisions, with the exception of the 5th Motorised Infantry Division (5e DIM). Its mission was to protect the southern flank of the Allied armies, south of the Sambre river and just north of Sedan. Further south, in France, was the French 2nd Army, protecting the Franco-Belgian border between Sedan and Montm√©dy. The two weakest French armies were thus protecting the area of the main German thrust.Foot 2005, p. 322. (map of French dispositions is available in Keegan's book) =British forces= The British contributed the weakest force to Belgium. The BEF, under the command of General Lord Gort VC, consisted of just 152,000 men in two corps of two divisions each. It was hoped to field two armies of two Corps each, but this scale of mobilisation never took place. The I Corps was commanded by Lt-Gen. John Dill, later Lt-Gen. Michael Barker, who was in turn replaced by Major-General Harold Alexander. Lt-Gen. Alan Brooke commanded II Corps. Later the III Corps under Lt-Gen. Ronald Adam was added to the British order of battle. A further 9,392 Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair was to support operations in Belgium. By May 1940 the BEF had grown to 394,165 men, of whom more than 150,000 were part of the logistical rear area organisations and had little military training.Foot 2005, p. 130. On 10 May 1940, the BEF comprised just 10 divisions (not all at full strength), 1,280 artillery pieces and 310 tanks.Foot 2005, p. 324. =German forces= Army Group B was commanded by Fedor von Bock. It was allocated 26 infantry and three Panzer divisions for the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. Of the three Panzer Divisions, the 3rd and 4th were to operate in Belgium under the command of the 6th Army's XVI Corps. The 9th Panzer Division was attached to the 18th Army which, after the Battle of the Netherlands, would support the push into Belgium alongside the 18th Army and cover its northern flank. Armour strength in Army Group B amounted to 808 tanks, of which 282 were Panzer Is, 288 were Panzer IIs, 123 were Panzer IIIs and 66 were Panzer IVs; 49 command tanks were also operational. The 3rd Panzer Division's armoured regiments consisted of 117 Panzer Is, 128 Panzer IIs, 42 Panzer IIIs, 26 Panzer IVs and 27 command tanks. The 4th Panzer Division had 136 Panzer Is, 105 Panzer IIs, 40 Panzer IIIs, 24 Panzer IVs and 10 command tanks. The 9th Panzer, scheduled initially for operations in the Netherlands, was the weakest division with only 30 Panzer Is, 54 Panzer IIs, 123, 66 Panzer IIIs and 49 Panzer IVs. The elements drawn from the 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division, that were to take part in the attack on Fort Eben-Emael, were named Sturmabteilung Koch (Assault Detachment Koch); named after the commanding officer of the group, Hauptmann Walter Koch. The force was assembled in November 1939. It was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division, as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots.Tugwell 2006, p. 52. The Luftwaffe allocated 1,815 combat, 487 transport aircraft and 50 gliders for the assault on the Low Countries. The initial air strikes over Belgian air space were to be conducted by IV. Fliegerkorps under General der Flieger Generaloberst Alfred Keller. Keller's force consisted of Lehrgeschwader 1 (Stab. I., II., III., IV.), Kampfgeschwader 30 (Stab. I., II., III.) and Kampfgeschwader 27 (III.). On 10 May Keller had 363 aircraft (224 serviceable) augmented by Generalmajor Wolfram von Richthofen's VIII. Fliegerkorps with 550 (420 serviceable) aircraft. They in turn were supported by Oberst Kurt-Bertram von D√∂ring's Jagdfliegerf√ºhrer 2, with 462 fighters (313 serviceable). Keller's IV. Fliegerkorps headquarters would operate from D√ºsseldorf, LG 1. Kampfgeschwader 30 which was based at Oldenburg and its III. Gruppe were based at Marx. Support for D√∂ring and Von Richthofen came from present-day North Rhine-Westphalia and bases in Grevenbroich, M√∂nchengladbach, Dortmund and Essen. Battle =Luftwaffe operations: 10 May= During the evening of 9 May, the Belgian Military attach√© in Berlin intimated that the Germans intended to attack the following day. Offensive movement of enemy forces were detected on the border. At 00:10 on 10 May 1940, at General Headquarters an unspecified squadron in Brussels gave the alarm. A full state of alert was instigated at 01:30 am. Belgian forces took up their deployment positions. The Allied armies had enacted their Dyle plan on the morning of 10 May, and were approaching the Belgian rear. King Leopold had gone to his Headquarters near Briedgen, Antwerp. The Luftwaffe was to spearhead the aerial battle in the low countries. Its first task was the elimination of the Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, the air campaign in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had a tremendous impact on the A√©MI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May. Much of the success achieved was down to Richthofen's subordinates, particularly Kampfgeschwader 77 and its commander Oberst Dr. Johann-Volkmar Fisser whose attachment to VIII. Fliegerkorps, was noted by Generalmajor Wilhelm Speidel. He commented it \\"...was the result of the well-known tendency of the commanding general to conduct his own private war\\". Fisser's KG 77 destroyed the A√©MI main bases, with help from KG 54. Fighters from Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) eliminated two Belgian squadrons at Neerhespen, and during the afternoon, I./St.G 2 destroyed nine of the 15 Fiat CR.42 fighters at Brustem. At Schaffen-Diest, three Hawker Hurricanes of Escadrille 2/I/2 were destroyed and another six damaged when a wave of He 111s caught them as they were about to take off. A further two were lost in destroyed hangars. At Nivelles airfield, 13 CR42s were destroyed. The only other success was KG 27s destruction of eight aircraft at Belesle. In aerial combat the battles were also one-sided. Two He 111s, two Do 17s and three Messerschmitt Bf 109s were shot down by Gloster Gladiators and Hurricanes. In return, eight Belgian Gladiators, five Fairey Foxs and one CR42 were shot down by JG 1, 21 and 27. No. 18 Squadron RAF sent two Bristol Blenheims on operations over the Belgian front, but lost both to Bf 109s. By the end of 10 May, the official German figures indicate claims for 30 Belgian aircraft destroyed on the ground, and 14 (plus the two RAF bombers) in the air for 10 losses. The victory claims are likely an undercount. A total of 83 Belgian machines‚Äìmostly trainers and \\"squadron hacks\\", were destroyed. The A√©MI flew only 146 sorties in the first six days. Between 16 May and 28 May, the A√©MI flew just 77 operations. It spent most of its time retreating and fuel withdrawing in the face of Luftwaffe attacks. =10‚Äì11 May: The border Battles= Sturmabteilung Koch pose for a photograph after the capture of Fort Eben-Emael. The German planners had recognised the need to eliminate Fort Eben-Emael if their army was to break into the interior of Belgium. It decided to deploy airborne forces (Fallschirmj√§ger) to land inside the fortress perimeter using gliders. Using special explosives (and flamethrowers) to disable the defences, the Fallschirmj√§ger then entered the fortress. In the ensuing battle, German infantry overcame the defenders of the I Belgian Corps' 7th Infantry Division in 24 hours. The main Belgian defence line had been breached and German infantry of the 18th Army had passed through it rapidly. Moreover, German soldiers had established bridgeheads across the Albert Canal before the British were able to reach it some 48 hours later. The Chasseurs Ardennais further south, on the orders of their commander, withdrew behind the Meuse, destroying some bridges in their wake. The German airborne forces were assisted by Junkers Ju 87 Stukas of III./'Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 (StG 2) and I./Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (StG 77) helped suppress the defences.

Further successful German airborne offensive operations were carried out in Luxembourg which seized five crossings and communication routes leading into central Belgium. The offensive, carried out by 125 volunteers of the 34th Infantry Division under the command of Wenner Hedderich, achieved their missions by flying to their objectives using Fieseler Fi 156 St√∂rche. The cost was the loss of five aircraft and 30 dead. With the fort breached, the Belgian 4th and 7th Infantry Divisions were confronted by the prospect of fighting an enemy on relatively sound terrain (for armour operations). The 7th Division, with its 2nd and 18th Grenadier Regiments and 2nd Carabineers, struggled to hold their positions and contain the German infantry on the west bank. The Belgian tactical units engaged in several counterattacks. At one point, at Briedgen, they succeeded in retaking the bridge and blowing it up. At the other points, Vroenhoven and Veldwezelt, the Germans had had time to establish strong bridgeheads and repulsed the attacks. German soldiers are welcomed into Eupen-Malmedy, a German border region annexed by Belgium in the Treaty of Versailles (1919) A little known third airborne operation, Operation Niwi, was also conducted on 10 May in southern Belgium. The objectives of this operation was to land two companies of the 3rd battalion Grossdeutschland Infantry Regiment by Fi 156 aircraft at Nives and Witry in the south of the country, in order to clear a path for the 1st and 2nd Panzer divisions which were advancing through the Belgian‚ÄìLuxembourg Ardennes. The original plan called for the use of Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, but the short landing capability of the Fi 156 (27 metres) saw 200 of these aircraft used in the assault. The operational mission was to: > 1\\\\. Cut signal communications and message links on the Neufch√¢teau‚ÄìBastogne > and Neufch√¢teau‚ÄìMartelange roads. [Neufch√¢teau being the largest > southernmost city in Belgium] > 2\\\\. Prevent the approach of reserves from the Neufch√¢teau area > 3\\\\. Facilitate the capture of pillboxes and the advance by exerting > pressure against the line of pillboxes along the border from the rear. The German infantry were engaged by several Belgian patrols equipped with T-15 armoured cars. Several Belgian counterattacks were repulsed, among them an attack by the 1st Light Chasseurs Ardennais Division. Unsupported, the Germans faced a counterattack later in the evening by elements of the French 5th Cavalry Division, dispatched by General Charles Huntziger from the French 2nd Army, which had a significant tank strength. The Germans were forced to retreat. The French, however, failed to pursue the fleeing German units, stopping at a dummy barrier. By the next morning, the 2nd Panzer Division had reached the area, and the mission had largely been accomplished. From the German perspective, the operation hindered rather than helped Heinz Guderian's Panzer Corps. The regiment had blocked the roads and, against the odds, prevented French reinforcements reaching the Belgian‚ÄìFranco-Luxembourg border, but it also destroyed Belgian telephone communications. This inadvertently prevented the Belgian field command recalling the units along the border. The 1st Belgian Light Infantry did not receive the signal to retreat and engaged in a severe fire-fight with the German armour, slowing down their advance. The failure of the Franco‚ÄìBelgian forces to hold the Ardennes gap was fatal. The Belgians had withdrawn laterally upon the initial invasion and had demolished and blocked routes of advance, which held up the French 2nd Army units moving north toward Namur and Huy. Devoid of any centre of resistance, the German assault engineers had cleared the obstacles unchallenged. The delay that the Belgian Ardennes Light Infantry, considered to be an elite formation, could have inflicted upon the advancing German armour was proved by the fight for Bodange, where the 1st Panzer Division was held up for a total of eight hours. This battle was a result of a breakdown in communications and ran contrary to the operational intentions of the Belgian Army. Herseaux on 10 May Meanwhile, in the central Belgian sector, having failed to restore their front by means of ground attack, the Belgians attempted to bomb the bridges and positions that the Germans had captured intact and were holding on 11 May. Belgian Fairey Battles of 5/III/3 escorted by six Gloster Gladiators attacked the Albert Canal bridges. Bf 109s from I./Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1) and I./JG 27 intercepted and JG 1 shot down four Gladiators and both units destroyed six Battles and heavily damaged the remaining three. Eight CR.42s were evacuated from Brustem to Grimbergen near Brussels but seven Gladiators and the last remaining Hurricanes from 2/I/2 Escadrille were destroyed at Beauvechain Air Base and Le Culot by He 111s and I./JG 27 respectively.Cull 1999, p. 61. The RAF contributed to the effort to attack the bridges. The British dispatched Bristol Blenheims from 110 and 21 Squadron‚Äîthe first squadron lost two, one to I./JG 27. 21 Squadron suffered damage to most of the bombers because of intense ground-fire. The French Arm√©e de l'air dispatched LeO 451s from GBI/12 and GBII/12 escorted by 18 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 of GCIII/3 and GCII/6. The operation failed and one bomber was lost while four M.S.406s fell to I.JG 1. The French claimed five. Meanwhile, 114 Squadron lost six Blenheims destroyed when Dornier Do 17s of Kampfgeschwader 2 bombed their airfield at Vraux. Another Battle of No. 150 Squadron RAF was lost in another raid.Cull 1999, pp. 61‚Äì62. The German counter-air operations were spearheaded by Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) under the command of Hans-Hugo Witt, which was responsible for 82 of the German claims in aerial combat between 11 and 13 May. Despite the apparent success of the German fighter units, the air battle was not one-sided. On the morning of 11 May ten Ju 87s of StG 2 were shot down attacking Belgian forces in the Namur‚ÄìDinant gap, despite the presence of two Jagdgeschwader‚Äî27 and 51. Nevertheless, the Germans reported a weakening in Allied air resistance in northern Belgium by 13 May. During the night of 11 May, the British 3rd Infantry Division under the command of General Bernard Law Montgomery, reached its position on the Dyle river at Leuven. As it did so the Belgian 10th Infantry Division, occupying the position, mistook them for German parachutists and fired on them. The Belgians refused to yield but Montgomery claimed to have got his way by placing himself under the command of the Belgian forces, knowing that when the Germans came within artillery range the Belgians would withdraw. Alan Brooke, commander of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in and said that the 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was on the wrong side of the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities. The Allies had more serious grounds for complaint about the Belgian anti-tank defences along the Dyle line, that covered the Namur‚ÄìPerwez gap which was not protected by any natural obstacles. Only a few days before the attack, General Headquarters had discovered the Belgians had sited their anti-tank defences (de Cointet defences) several miles east of the Dyle between Namur‚ÄìPerwez. After holding onto the Albert Canal's west bank for nearly 36 hours, the 4th and 7th Belgian infantry divisions withdrew. The capture of Eben-Emael allowed the Germans to force through the Panzers of the 6th Army. The situation for the Belgian divisions was either to withdraw or be encircled. The Germans had advanced beyond Tongeren and were now in a position to sweep south to Namur, which would threaten to envelop the entire Albert Canal and Li√®ge positions. Under the circumstances, both divisions withdrew. On the evening of 11 May, the Belgian Command withdrew its forces behind the Namur‚ÄìAntwerp line. The following day, the French 1st Army arrived at Gembloux, between Wavre and Namur, to cover the \\"Gembloux gap\\". It was a flat area, devoid of prepared or entrenched positions. The French 7th Army, on the northern flank of the Belgian line, protected the Bruges‚ÄìGhent‚ÄìOstend axis and, covering the Channel ports, had advanced into Belgium and into the Netherlands with speed. It reached Breda in the Netherlands, on 11 May. But German parachute forces had seized the Moerdijk bridge on the Hollands Diep river, south of Rotterdam, making it impossible for the French to link up with the Dutch Army. The Dutch Army withdrew north to Rotterdam and Amsterdam. The French 7th Army turned east and met the 9th Panzer Division about east of Breda at Tilburg. The battle resulted in the French retiring, in the face of Luftwaffe air assaults, to Antwerp. It would later help in the defence of the city. The Luftwaffe had given priority to attacking the French 7th Army's spearhead into the Netherlands as it threatened the Moerdijk bridgehead. Kampfgeschwader 40 and 54 supported by Ju 87s from VIII. Fliegerkorps helped drive them back. Fears of Allied reinforcements reaching Antwerp forced the Luftwaffe to cover the Scheldt estuary. KG 30 bombed and sank two Dutch gunboats and three Dutch destroyers, as well as badly damaging two Royal Navy destroyers. But overall the bombing had a limited effect. =12‚Äì14 May: Battles of the central Belgian plain= Belgian civilians fleeing westwards away from the advancing German army, 12 May 1940 During the night of 11/12 May, the Belgians were fully engaged in withdrawing to the Dyle line, covered by a network of demolitions and rearguards astride Tongeren. During the morning of 12 May, King Leopold III, General van Overstraeten, √âdouard Daladier, General Alphonse Georges (commander of the First Allied army Group, comprising the BEF, French 1st, 2nd, 7th and 9th Armies), General Gaston Billotte (coordinator of the Allied Armies) and General Henry Royds Pownall, Gort's chief of staff, met for a military conference near Mons. It was agreed the Belgian Army would man the Antwerp‚ÄìLeuven line, while its allies took up the responsibility of defending the extreme north and south of the country. The Belgian III Corps, and its 1st Chasseurs Ardennais, 2nd Infantry and 3rd Infantry Divisions had withdrawn from the Li√®ge fortifications to avoid being encircled. One regiment, the Li√®ge Fortress Regiment, stayed behind to disrupt German communications. Further to the south, the Namur fortress, manned by VI Corps' 5th Infantry Division and the 2nd Chasseurs Ardennais with the 12th French Infantry Division, fought delaying actions and participated in a lot of demolition work while guarding the position. As far as the Belgians were concerned, it had accomplished the only independent mission assigned to it: to hold the Li√®ge‚ÄìAlbert Canal line long enough for the Allied units to reach friendly forces occupying the Namur‚ÄìAntwerp‚ÄìGivet line. For the remainder of the campaign, the Belgians would execute their operations in accordance with the overall Allied plan. Belgian soldiers fought rearguard actions while other Belgian units already on the Dyle line worked tirelessly to organise better defensive positions in the Leuven‚ÄìAntwerp gap. The 2nd Regiment of Guides and the 2nd Carabineers Cyclists of the 2nd Belgian Cavalry Division covered the retreat of the 4th and 7th Belgian divisions and were particularly distinguished at the Battle of Tirlemont and the Battle of Halen. In support of Belgian forces in the area, the RAF and French flew air defence operations in the Tirlemont and Louvain area. The RAF Advanced Air Striking Force committed 3, 504, 79, 57, 59, 85, 87, 605, and 242 squadrons to battle. A series of air battles were fought with JG 1, 2, 26, 27 and 3. Messerschmitt Bf 110s from Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 (ZG 26), and bomber units LG 1, 2 and KG 27 were also involved.Cull 1999, pp. 116‚Äì121. Over Belgium and France, the day was disastrous for the British: 27 Hurricanes were shot down.Cull 1999, p. 135. In light of the withdrawal to the main defensive line, which was now being supported by the British and French Armies, King Leopold issued the following proclamation to improve morale after the defeats at the Albert Canal: > Soldiers > The Belgian Army, brutally assailed by an unparalleled surprise attack, > grappling with forces that are better equipped and have the advantage of a > formidable air force, has for three days carried out difficult operations, > the success of which is of the utmost importance to the general conduct of > the battle and to the result of war. > These operations require from all of us ‚Äì officers and men ‚Äì exceptional > efforts, sustained day and night, despite a moral tension tested to its > limits by the sight of the devastation wrought by a pitiless invader. > However severe the trial may be, you will come through it gallantly. > Our position improves with every hour; our ranks are closing up. In the > critical days that are ahead of us, you will summon up all your energies, > you will make every sacrifice, to stem the invasion. > Just as they did in 1914 on the Yser, so now the French and British troops > are counting on you: the safety and honour of the country are in your hands. > Leopold. German Panzer II tanks in western Belgium, May 1940 To the Allies, the Belgian failure to hold onto its eastern frontiers (they were thought to be capable of holding out for two weeks), was a disappointment. The Allied Chiefs of Staff had sought to avoid an encounter mobile battle without any strong fixed defences to fall back on and hoped Belgian resistance would last long enough for a defensive line to be established. Nevertheless, a brief lull fell on the Dyle front on 11 May which enabled the Allied armies to get into position by the time the first major assault was launched the following day. Allied cavalry had moved into position and infantry and artillery were reaching the front more slowly, by rail. Although unaware of it, the First Allied army Group and the Belgian Army outnumbered and outgunned Walther von Reichenau's German 6th Army. On the morning of 12 May, in response to Belgian pressure and necessity, the Royal Air Force and the Arm√©e de l'Air undertook several air attacks on the German-held Maastricht and Meuse bridges to prevent German forces flowing into Belgium. 74 sorties had been flown by the Allies since 10 May. On 12 May, eleven out of eighteen French Breguet 693 bombers were shot down. The RAF Advanced Air Striking Force, which included the largest Allied bomber force, was reduced to 72 aircraft out of 135 by 12 May. For the next 24 hours, missions were postponed as the German anti-aircraft and fighter defences were too strong. The results of the bombing is difficult to determine. The German XIX Corps war diary's situation summary at 20:00 on 14 May noted: > The completion of the military bridge at Donchery had not yet been carried > out owing to heavy flanking artillery fire and long bombing attacks on the > bridging point ... Throughout the day all three divisions have had to endure > constant air attack ‚Äî especially at the crossing and bridging points. Our > fighter cover is inadequate. Requests [for increased fighter protection] are > still unsuccessful. The Luftwaffe's operations includes a note of \\"vigorous enemy fighter activity through which our close reconnaissance in particular is severely impeded\\". Nevertheless, inadequate protection was given to cover RAF bombers against the strength of German opposition over the target area. In all, out of 109 Fairey Battles and Bristol Blenheims which had attacked enemy columns and communications in the Sedan area, 45 had been lost. On 15 May, daylight bombing was significantly reduced. Of 23 aircraft employed, four failed to return. Equally, owing to the Allied fighter presence, the German XIX Corps War Diary states, \\"Corps no longer has at its disposal its own long-range reconnaissance ... [Reconnaissance squadrons] are no longer in a position to carry out vigorous, extensive reconnaissance, as, owing to casualties, more than half of their aircraft are not now available.\\" General Erich Hoepner commanded XVI Army Corps at the Battle of Hannut and the Gembloux gap offensive The most serious combat to evolve on 12 May 1940 was the beginning of the Battle of Hannut (12‚Äì14 May). While the German Army Group A advanced through the Belgian Ardennes, Army Group B's 6th Army launched an offensive operation toward the Gembloux gap. Gembloux occupied a position in the Belgian plain; it was an unfortified, untrenched space in the main Belgian defensive line. The Gap stretched from the southern end of the Dyle line, from Wavre in the north, to Namur in the south, to . After attacking out of the Maastricht bulge and defeating the Belgian defences at Liege, which compelled the Belgian I Corps to retreat, the German 6th Army's XVI Panzer-Motorized Corps, under the command of General Erich Hoepner and containing the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, launched an offensive in the area where the French mistakenly expected the main German thrust. The Gembloux gap was defended by the French 1st Army, with six elite divisions including the 2nd (2e Division L√©g√®re M√©canique, or 2e DLM) and 3rd Light Mechanized Divisions. The Prioux Cavalry Corps, under the command of Rene-Jacques-Adolphe Prioux, was to advance beyond the line (east) to provide a screen for the move. The French 1st and 2nd Armoured Divisions were to be moved behind the French 1st Army to defend its main lines in depth. The Prioux Cavalry Corps was equal to a German Panzer Corps and was to occupy a screening line on the Tirlemont‚ÄìHannut‚ÄìHuy axis. The operational plan called for the Corps to delay the German advance on Gembloux and Hannut until the main elements of the French 1st Army had reached Gembloux and dug in. Hoepner's Panzer Corps and Prioux' Cavalry clashed head-on near Hannut, Belgium, on 12 May. Contrary to popular belief, the Germans did not outnumber the French. Frequently, figures of 623 German and 415 French tanks are given. The German 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions numbered 280 and 343 respectively. The 2e DLM and 3e DLM numbered 176 Somuas and 239 Hotchkiss H35s. Added to this force were the considerable number of Renault AMR-ZT-63s in the Cavalry Corps. The R35 was equal or superior to the Panzer I and Panzer IIs in armament terms. This applies all the more to the 90 Panhard 178 armoured cars of the French Army. Its 25mm main gun could penetrate the armour of the Panzer IV. In terms of tanks that were capable of engaging and surviving a tank-vs-tank action, the Germans possessed just 73 Panzer IIIs and 52 Panzer IVs. The French had 176 SOMUA and 239 Hotchkisses. German tank units also contained 486 Panzer I and IIs, which were of dubious combat value given their losses in the Polish Campaign. The German forces were able to communicate by radio during the battle and they could shift the point of the main effort unexpectedly. The Germans also practiced combined arms tactics, while the French tactical deployment was a rigid and linear leftover from the First World War. French tanks did not possess radios and often the commanders had to dismount to issue orders. Despite the disadvantages experienced by the Germans in armour, they were able to gain the upper hand in the morning battle on 12 May, encircling several French battalions. The combat power of the French 2e DLM managed to defeat the German defences guarding the pockets and freeing the trapped units. Contrary to German reports, the French were victorious on that first day, preventing a Wehrmacht break-through to Gembloux or seizing Hannut. The result of the first day's battle was: > The effect on the German light tanks was catastrophic. Virtually every > French weapon from 25mm upward penetrated the 7-13mm of the Panzer I. > Although the Panzer II fared somewhat better, especially those that had been > up-armoured since the Polish Campaign, their losses were high. Such was the > sheer frustration of the crews of these light Panzers in [the] face of > heavier armoured French machines that some resorted to desperate expedients. > One account speaks of a German Panzer commander attempting to climb on a > Hotchkiss H-35 with a hammer, presumably to smash the machine's periscopes, > but falling off and being crushed by the tank's tracks. Certainly by day's > end, Prioux had reason to claim that his tanks had come off best. The > battlefield around Hannut was littered with knocked-out tanks‚Äìthe bulk of > which were German Panzers‚Äìwith by far and away the bulk of them being Panzer > Is and IIs. German soldiers inspect an abandoned Belgian T-13 tank destroyer The following day, 13 May, the French were undone by their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour out in a thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which was the point of sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected. On 12 and 13 May, 2e DLM lost no AFVs, but the 3e DLM lost 30 SOMUAs and 75 Hotchkisses. The French had disabled 160 German tanks. But as the poor linear deployment had allowed the Germans the chance of breaking through in one spot, the entire battlefield had to be abandoned, the Germans repaired nearly three-quarters of their tanks; 49 were destroyed and 111 were repaired. They had 60 men killed and another 80 wounded. In terms of battlefield casualties, the Hannut battle had resulted in the French knocking-out 160 German tanks, losing 105 themselves. Prioux had achieved his tactical mission and withdrew. Beaumont on 16 May Hoepner now pursued the retreating French. Being impatient, he did not wait for his infantry divisions to catch up. Instead, he hoped to continue pushing the French back and not give them time to construct a coherent defence line. German formations pursued the enemy to Gembloux. The Panzer Corps ran into retreating French columns and inflicted heavy losses on them. The pursuit created severe problems for the French artillery. The combat was so closely fought that the danger of friendly fire incidents were very real. Nevertheless, the French, setting up new anti-tank screens and Hoepner, lacking infantry support, caused the Germans to attack positions head-on. During the following Battle of Gembloux the two Panzer Divisions reported heavy losses during 14 May and were forced to slow their pursuit. The German attempts to capture Gembloux were repulsed. Although suffering numerous tactical reverses, operationally the Germans diverted the Allied First Army Group from the lower Ardennes area. In the process his forces, along with the Luftwaffe depleted Prioux' Cavalry Corps. When news of the German breakthrough at Sedan reached Prioux, he withdrew from Gembloux. With the Gembloux gap breached, the German Panzer Corps, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, were no longer required by Army Group B and were handed over to Army Group A. Army Group B would continue its own offensive to force the collapse of the Meuse front. The Army Group was in a position to advance westward to Mons, outflank the BEF and Belgian Army protecting the Dyle‚ÄìBrussels sector, or turn south to outflank the French 9th Army. German losses had been heavy at Hannut and Gembloux. The 4th Panzer Division was down to 137 tanks on 16 May, including just four Panzer IVs. The 3rd Panzer Division was down by 20‚Äì25 percent of its operational force, while the 4th Panzer Division 45‚Äì50 percent of its tanks were not combat ready. Damaged tanks were quickly repaired, but its strength was initially greatly weakened. The French 1st Army had also taken a battering and despite winning several tactical defensive victories it was forced to retreat on 15 May owing to developments elsewhere, leaving its tanks on the battlefield, while the Germans were free to recover theirs. =15‚Äì21 May: Counterattacks and retreat to the coast= Pak 36 anti-tank gun in western Belgium in May 1940. On the morning of 15 May, German Army Group A broke the defences at Sedan and was now free to drive for the English Channel. The Allies considered a wholesale withdrawal from the Belgian trap. The withdrawal would reflect three stages: the night of 16/17 May to the River Senne, the night of 17/18 May to the river Dendre and the night of 18/19 May to the river Scheldt. The Belgians were reluctant to abandon Brussels and Leuven, especially as the Dyle line had withstood German pressure well. The Belgian Army, the BEF and the French 1st Army, in a domino effect, was ordered/forced to retire on 16 May to avoid their southern flanks from being turned by the German armoured forces advancing through the French Ardennes and the German 6th Army advancing through Gembloux. The Belgian Army was holding the German Fourteenth Army on the KW-line, along with the French 7th and British armies. Had it not been for the collapse of the French 2nd Army at Sedan, the Belgians were confident that they could have checked the German advance. The situation called for the French and British to abandon the Antwerp‚ÄìNamur line and strong positions in favour of improvised positions behind the Scheldt, without facing any real resistance. In the South, General Deffontaine of the Belgian VII Corps retreated from the Namur and Li√®ge regions, the Li√®ge fortress region put up stiff resistance to the German 6th Army. In the North, the 7th Army was diverted to Antwerp after the surrender of the Dutch on 15 May, but was then diverted to support the French 1st Army. In the centre, the Belgian Army and the BEF suffered little German pressure. On 15 May, the only sector to really be tested was around Leuven, which was held by the British 3rd Division. The BEF was not pursued vigorously to the Scheldt. After the withdrawal of the French Army from the northern sector, the Belgians were left to guard the fortified city of Antwerp. Four infantry divisions (including the 13th and 17th Reserve Infantry Divisions) engaged the German Eighteenth Army's 208th, 225th and 526th Infantry Divisions. The Belgians successfully defended the northern part of the city, delaying the German infantry forces while starting to withdraw from Antwerp on 16 May. The city fell on 18/19 May after considerable Belgian resistance. On 18 May the Belgians received word that Namur's Fort Marchovelette had fallen; Suarlee fell on 19 May; St. Heribert and Malonne on 21 May; Dave, Maizeret and Andoy on 23 May. Renault ACG1 tank, knocked out during the Battle for Antwerp, 19 May 1940 Between 16 and 17 May, the British and French withdrew behind the Willebroek Canal, as the volume of Allied forces in Belgium fell and moved toward the German armoured thrust from the Ardennes. The Belgian I Corps and V Corps also retreated to what the Belgians called the Ghent bridgehead, behind the Dendre and Scheldt. The Belgian Artillery Corps and its infantry support defeated attacks by the Eighteenth Army's infantry and in a communiqu√© from London, the British recognized the \\"Belgian Army has contributed largely toward the success of the defensive battle now being fought. Nevertheless, the now-outnumbered Belgians abandoned Brussels and the Government fled to Ostend. The city was occupied by the German Army on 17 May. The very next morning, Hoepner, the German XVI Corps commander, was ordered to release the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions to Army Group A. This left the 9th Panzer Division attached to the Eighteenth Army as the only armoured unit on the Belgian front. By 19 May, the Germans were hours away from reaching the French Channel coast. Gort had discovered the French had neither plan nor reserves and little hope for stopping the German thrust to the channel. He was concerned that the French 1st Army on its southern flank had been reduced to a disorganized mass of \\"fag-ends\\", fearing that German armour might appear on their right flank at Arras or P√©ronne, striking for the channel ports at Calais or Boulogne or north west into the British flank. Their position in Belgium massively compromised, the BEF considered abandoning Belgium and retreating to Ostend, Bruges or Dunkirk, the latter lying some to inside the French border. The proposals of a British strategic withdrawal from the continent was rejected by the War Cabinet and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS). They dispatched General Ironside to inform Gort of their decision and to order him to conduct an offensive to the south-west \\"through all opposition\\" to reach the \\"main French forces\\" in the south [the strongest French forces were actually in the north]. The Belgian Army was asked to conform to the plan, or should they choose, the British Royal Navy would evacuate what units they could. The British cabinet decided that even if the \\"Somme offensive\\" was carried out successfully, some units may still need to be evacuated, and ordered Admiral Ramsay to assemble a large number of vessels. This was the beginning of Operation Dynamo. Ironside arrived at British General Headquarters at 06:00 am on 20 May, the same day that continental communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt and even if it was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had to be made by the French to the south. Strategic situation in Belgium and France on 21 May The Belgian position on any offensive move was made clear by Leopold III. As far as he was concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made clear that in the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position in order to keep contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May. In the aftermath of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and would lead to the Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical task that would take too long to complete. At this time, the Belgians and the British concluded that the French were beaten and the Allied Armies in the pocket on the Belgian‚ÄìFranco border would be destroyed if action was not taken. The British, having lost confidence in their Allies, decided to look to the survival of the BEF. =22‚Äì28 May: Last defensive battles= The Germans advance to the English Channel after 21 May The Belgian battle-front on the morning of 22 May extended some from north to south, beginning with the Cavalry Corps, which checked its advance at Terneuzen. V, II, VI, VII and IV Corps (all Belgian) were drawn up side by side. Two further signal Corps were guarding the coast. These formations were then largely holding the eastern front as the BEF and French forces withdrew to the west to protect Dunkirk, which was vulnerable to German assault on 22 May. The eastern front remained intact, but the Belgians now occupied their last fortified position at Leie. The Belgian I Corps, with only two incomplete divisions, had been heavily engaged in the fighting and their line was wearing thin. On that day, Winston Churchill visited the front and pressed for the French and British Armies to break out from the north-east. He assumed that the Belgian Cavalry Corps could support the offensives' right flank. Churchill dispatched the following message to Gort: > 1\\\\. That the Belgian Army should withdraw to the line of the Yser and stand > there, the sluices being opened. > 2\\\\. That the British Army and French 1st Army should attack south-west > toward Bapaume and Cambrai at the earliest moment, certainly tomorrow, with > about eight divisions, and with the Belgian Cavalry Corps on the right of > the British. Such an order ignored the fact that the Belgian Army could not withdraw to the Yser, and there was little chance of any Belgian Cavalry joining in the attack. The plan for the Belgian withdrawal was sound; the Yser river covered Dunkirk to the east and south, while the La Bass√©e Canal covered it from the west. The ring of the Yser also dramatically shorted the Belgian Army's area of operations. Such a move would have abandoned Passchendaele and Ypres and would have certainly meant the capture of Ostend while further reducing the amount of Belgian territory still free by a few square miles. German troops watch Belgian civilian refugees fleeing the fighting On 23 May, the French tried to conduct a series of offensives against the German defensive line on the Ardennes‚ÄìCalais axis but failed to make any meaningful gains. Meanwhile, on the Belgian front, the Belgians, under pressure, retreated further, and the Germans captured Terneuzen and Ghent that day. The Belgians also had trouble moving the oil, food and ammunition that they had left. The Luftwaffe had air superiority and made everyday life hazardous in logistical terms. Air support could only be called in by \\"wireless\\" and the RAF was operating from bases in southern England which made communication more difficult. The French denied the use of the Dunkirk, Bourbourg and Gravelines bases to the Belgians, which had initially been placed at its disposal. The Belgians were forced to use the only harbours left to them, at Nieuport and Ostend. Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who had taken over command from Gamelin, were still determined to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened what remained of the Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; such a move would have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south. On the afternoon of 24 May, von Bock had thrown four divisions, of Reichenau's 6th Army, against the Belgian IV Corps position at the Kortrijk area of the Leie during the Battle of the Lys (1940). The Germans managed, against fierce resistance, to cross the river at night and force a one-mile penetration along a 13-mile front between Wervik and Kortrijk. The Germans, with superior numbers and in command of the air, had won the bridgehead. Nevertheless, the Belgians had inflicted many casualties and several tactical defeats on the Germans. The 1st, 3rd, 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions, acting as reinforcements, had counterattacked several times and managed to capture 200 German prisoners. Belgian artillery and infantry were then heavily attacked by the Luftwaffe, which forced their defeat. The Belgians blamed the French and British for not providing air cover. The German bridgehead dangerously exposed the eastern flank of the southward stretched BEF's 4th Infantry Division. Montgomery dispatched several units of the 3rd Infantry Division (including the heavy infantry of the 1st and 7th Middlesex battalions and the 99th Battery, 20th Anti-Tank Regiment), as an improvised defence. A critical point of the \\"Weygand Plan\\" and the British government and French Army's argument for a thrust south, was the withdrawal of forces to see the offensive through which had left the Belgian Army over-extended and was instrumental in its collapse. It was forced to cover the areas held by the BEF in order to enable the latter to engage in the offensive. Such a collapse could have resulted in the loss of the Channel ports behind the Allied front, leading to a complete strategic encirclement. The BEF could have done more to counterattack von Bock's left flank to relieve the Belgians as von Bock attacked across the fortified British position at Kortrijk. The Belgian High Command made at least five appeals for the British to attack the vulnerable left flank of the German divisions between the Scheldt and the Leie to avert disaster. Admiral Sir Roger Keyes transmitted the following message to GHQ: > Van Overstraten is desperately keen for strong British counterattack. Either > north or south of Leie could help restore the situation. Belgians expect to > be attacked on the Ghent front tomorrow. Germans already have a bridgehead > over canal west of Eecloo. There can be no question of the Belgian > withdrawal to Yser. One battalion on march NE of Ypres was practically wiped > out today in attack by sixty aircraft. Withdrawal over open roads without > adequate fighter support very costly. Whole of their supplies are east of > Yser. They strongly represent attempt should be made to restore the > situation on Leie by British counter-attack for which opportunity may last > another few hours only. No such attack came. The Germans brought fresh reserves to cover the gap (Menen‚ÄìYpres). This nearly cut the Belgians off from the British. The 2nd, 6th and 10th Cavalry Divisions frustrated German attempts to exploit the gap in depth but the situation was still critical. On 26 May, Operation Dynamo officially commenced, in which large French and British contingents were to be evacuated to the United Kingdom. By that time, the Royal Navy had already withdrawn 28,000 British non-fighting troops. Boulogne had fallen and Calais was about to, leaving Dunkirk, Ostend and Zeebrugge as the only viable ports which could be used for evacuation. The advance of the 14th German Army would not leave Ostend available for much longer. To the west, the German Army Group A had reached Dunkirk and were from its centre on the morning of 27 May, bringing the port within artillery range. The situation on 27 May had changed considerably from just 24 hours earlier. The Belgian Army had been forced from the Leie line on 26 May, and Nevele, Vynckt, Tielt and Iseghem had fallen on the western and central part of the Leie front. In the east, the Germans had reached the outskirts of Bruges, and captured Ursel. In the west, the Menen‚ÄìYpres line had broken at Kortrijk and the Belgians were now using railway trucks to help form anti-tank defences on a line from Ypres‚ÄìPasschendaele‚ÄìRoulers. Further to the west the BEF had been forced back, north of Lille just over the French border and was now in danger of allowing a gap to develop between themselves and the Belgian southern flank on the Ypres‚ÄìLille axis. The danger in allowing a German advance to Dunkirk would mean the loss of the port which was now too great. The British withdrew to the port on 26 May. In doing so, they left the French 1st Army's north-eastern flank near Lille exposed. As the British moved out, the Germans moved in, encircling the bulk of the French Army. Both Gort and his Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, accepted that their withdrawal would mean the destruction of the French 1st Army, and they would be blamed for it. The fighting of 26‚Äì27 May had brought the Belgian Army to the brink of collapse. The Belgians still held the Ypres‚ÄìRoulers line to the west, and the Bruges‚ÄìThelt line to the east. However, on 27 May, the central front collapsed in the Iseghem‚ÄìThelt sector. There was now nothing to prevent a German thrust to the east to take Ostend and Bruges, or west to take the ports at Nieuport or La Panne, deep in the Allied rear. The Belgians had practically exhausted all available means of resistance. The disintegration of the Belgian Army and its front caused many erroneous accusations by the British. In fact, on numerous occasions, the Belgians had held on after British withdrawals. One example was the taking over of the Scheldt line, where they relieved the British 44th Infantry Division, allowing it to retire through their ranks. Despite this, Gort and to a greater extent Pownall, showed anger at the Belgian King's decision to surrender on 28 May, considering it to undercut the war effort. . When it was inquired if any Belgians were to be evacuated, Pownall was reported to have replied, \\"We don't care a bugger what happens to the Belgians\\". =Belgian surrender= Belgian Propaganda Poster from King Leopold III with title \\"28 May 1940, Halt, Sire We will never forget this\\" in response to the Battle of Belgium. Negotiating the Belgian capitulation The Belgian Army was stretched from Cadzand south to Menen on the river Leie, and west, from Menin, to Bruges without any sort of reserves. With the exception of a few RAF sorties, the air was exclusively under the control of the Luftwaffe, and the Belgians reported attacks against all targets considered an objective, with resulting casualties. No natural obstacles remained between the Belgians and the German Army; retreat was not feasible. The Luftwaffe had destroyed most of the rail networks to Dunkirk, just three roads were left: Bruges‚ÄìTorhout‚ÄìDixmude, Bruges‚ÄìGhistelles‚ÄìNieuport and Bruges‚ÄìOstend‚ÄìNieuport. Using such axes of retreat was impossible without losses owing to German air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority). Water supplies were damaged and cut off, gas and electricity supplies were also cut. Canals were drained and used as supply dumps for whatever ammunition and food-stuffs were left. The total remaining area covered just 1,700 km2, and compacted military and civilians alike, of which the latter numbered some 3 million people. Under these circumstances Leopold deemed further resistance useless. On the evening of 27 May, he requested an armistice. Churchill sent a message to Keyes the same day, and made clear what he thought of the request: > Belgian Embassy here assumes from King's decision to remain that he regards > the war as lost and contemplates [a] separate peace. It is in order to > dissociate itself from this that the constitutional Belgian Government has > reassembled on foreign soil. Even if present Belgian Army has to lay down > its arms, there are 200,000 Belgians of military age in France, and greater > resources than Belgium had in 1914 which to fight back. By present decision > the King is dividing the Nation and delivering it into Hitler's protection. > Please convey these considerations to the King, and impress upon him the > disastrous consequences to the Allies and to Belgium of his present choice. The Royal Navy evacuated General Headquarters at Middelkerke and Sint-Andries, east of Bruges, during the night. Leopold III, and his mother Queen Mother Elisabeth, stayed in Belgium to endure five years of self-imposed captivity. In response to the advice of his government to set up a government-in-exile Leopold said, \\"I have decided to stay. The cause of the Allies is lost.\\" The Belgian surrender came into effect at 04:00 on 28 May. Recriminations abounded with the British and French claiming the Belgians had betrayed the alliance. In Paris, the French Premier Paul Reynaud denounced Leopold's surrender, and the Belgian Premier Hubert Pierlot informed the people that Leopold had taken action against the unanimous advice of the government. As a result, the king was no longer in a position to govern and the Belgian government in exile that was located in Paris (later moved to London following the fall of France) would continue the struggle. The chief complaint was that the Belgians had not given any prior warning that their situation was so serious as to capitulate. Such claims were largely unjust. The Allies had known, and admitted it privately on 25 May through contact with the Belgians, that the latter were on the verge of collapse. Churchill's and the British response was officially restrained. This was due to the strong-willed defence of the Belgian defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30 am 28 May. The French and Belgian ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.

Some P2Y12 inhibitors are used clinically as effective inhibitors of adenosine diphosphate-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Unlike clopidogrel (Plavix), which is a prodrug, cangrelor is an active drug not requiring metabolic conversion. Poor interim results led to the abandonment of the two CHAMPION clinical trials in mid-2009.CHAMPION Trials With Cangrelor Stopped for Lack of Efficacy The BRIDGE study, for short term use prior to surgery, continues. The CHAMPION PHOENIX trial was a randomized study of over 11,000 patients published in 2013. It found usefulness of cangrelor in patients getting cardiac stents. Compared with clopidogrel given around the time of stenting, intravenous ADP-receptor blockade with cangrelor significantly reduced the rate of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Reviewers have questioned the methodology of the trial. Medical use According to recent phase 3 randomized trials, a cangrelor‚Äìclopidogrel combination is safe and has been found to be more effective than standard clopidogrel treatment at reducing ischemic events in the heart, without increasing major bleeding in the treatment of stenotic coronary arteries. The advantages of this drug combination are most prominent in patients with myocardial infarction. Available antiplatelet drugs have delayed onset and offset of action. Since cangrelor‚Äôs effects are immediate and quickly reversed, it is a more desirable drug for elective treatment of stenotic coronary arteries, high risk acute coronary syndromes treated with immediate coronary stenting, and for bridging those surgery patients who require P2Y12 inhibition. Current evidence regarding cangrelor therapy is limited by the lack studies assessing cangrelor administration in conjunction with either prasugrel or ticagrelor. Recently, it's been approved for adult patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Pharmacology Cangrelor is a high-affinity, reversible inhibitor of P2Y12 receptors that causes almost complete inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregate. It is a modified ATP derivative stable to enzymatic degradation. It does not require metabolic conversion to an active metabolite. This allows cangrelor‚Äôs immediate effect after infusion, and the therapeutic effects can be maintained with continuous infusion. The pharmacokinetics of cangrelor has allow it to rapidly achieve steady-state concentrations with a clearance of 50 L/h and a half-life of 2.6 to 3.3 minutes. Cessation of its administration is associated with rapid removal, and normal platelet function is restored within 1 hour. Adverse effects Despite fewer bleeding events during cardiac surgery, cangrelor carries the risk of potential autoimmune reactions manifesting as breathlessness. Potential mechanisms for dyspnea following cangrelor treatment include: repeated binding and unbinding cycles, impaired platelet turnover, and lung sequestration or apoptosis of overloaded destructive platelets. The dyspnea risks following cangrelor treatment, suggest a common mechanism linking transfusion-related acute lung injury, dyspnea, and reversible platelet inhibition. The risk of breathlessness after intravenous cangrelor is smaller when compared with other reversible platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, however, it is still significantly higher when compared to irreversible oral antiplatelet drugs or intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors; which do not increase the incidence of breathlessness at all.

Gyda was born ca. 852 in Hordaland. She was the daughter of Eirik, King of Hordaland, (Eirik af Hordaland), one of the petty kings of pre-united Norway. Gyda was proposed to by Harold Fairhair who was then the king of the petty kingdom of Vestfold. She answered that she refused to marry Harald \\"before he was king over all of Norway\\". Harald was therefore induced to take a vow not to cut nor comb his hair until he was sole king of Norway. Ten years later, in 872, Harald became king of a united Norway. He was justified in trimming his hair; whereupon he exchanged the epithet \\"shockhead\\" or \\"tanglehair\\" for the one by which he is usually known. He sent for Gyda reminding her of the promise she made and they were married. Most scholars today regard this story as a truthful representation of the romance stories that were popular at the time Heimskringla was written in the 13th Century.

The usage of both terms has changed to adapt to a wide range of geographical and historical influences. The term \\"Hispanic\\" was used first; later, some Hispanics in the western United States came to prefer the term \\"Latino\\". The Census does not classify persons of Portuguese or Brazilian descent as Hispanic, as those are Portuguese-speaking populations. According to a 2011 study by the Pew Research Center, the majority (51%) of Hispanic and Latino Americans prefer to identify with their families' country of origin, while only 24% prefer the terms \\"Hispanic\\" or \\"Latino\\". While the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, for example, by the United States Census Bureau, \\"Hispanic\\" is a different term that refers to native speakers of Spanish, or have Spanish-speaking ancestry, while \\"Latino\\" is more frequently used to refer generally to anyone of Latin American origin or ancestry, which includes Brazilians. (Defining \\"Hispanic\\" as meaning those with Spanish- speaking roots in the Americas and \\"Latino\\" as meaning those with Spanish speaking roots in Latin America.) \\"Hispanic\\" thus includes persons from Spain and Spanish-speaking Latin Americans but excludes Portuguese and Brazilians. Because Brazil's population of 210,000,000 is several times larger than Spain's population of 47,000,000 and because there are more Brazilian-born Americans (325,547 as of 2012) than Spanish-born Americans (88,665 as of 2012)US Census Bureau 2012 American Community Survey B03001 1-Year Estimates SELECTED POPULATION PROFILE IN THE UNITED STATES retrieved September 24, 2013 in the United States, \\"Latino\\" is a broader term encompassing more people. The choice between the terms among those of Spanish-speaking origin is associated with location: persons of Spanish-speaking origin residing in the eastern United States tend to prefer \\"Hispanic\\", whereas those in the west tend to prefer \\"Latino\\". \\"Latino\\" as a category used in the United States may be understood as a shorthand for the Spanish word or the Portuguese phrase , thus excluding speakers of Romance languages from Europe., supported by Both \\"Hispanic\\" and \\"Latino\\" are generally used to denote people living in the United States. Outside of the United States, the natives of Latin American countries refer to the names of their respective counties of origin, similarly to using \\"Guatemalan\\", \\"Honduran\\", \\"Nicaraguan\\", etc., in English. History Hispanus was the Latin name given to a person from Hispania during Roman rule. The ancient Roman Hispania, which roughly comprised what is currently called the Iberian Peninsula, included the contemporary states of Spain, Portugal, and Andorra, and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. The term \\"Hispanic\\" was adopted by the United States government in the early 1970s during the administration of Richard Nixon after the Hispanic members of an interdepartmental Ad Hoc Committee to develop racial and ethnic definitions recommended that a universal term encompassing all Hispanic subgroups‚Äîincluding Central and South Americans‚Äîbe adopted.Huffington Post: \\"Latino Or Hispanic? How The Federal Government Decided\\" By Grace Flores- Hughes September 19, 2013 As the 1970 census did not include a question on Hispanic origin on all census forms‚Äîinstead relying on a sample of the population via an extended form (\\"Is this person's origin or descent: Mexican; Puerto Rican; Cuban; Central or South American; Other Spanish; or None of these\\"),U.S. Census website: US Census History ‚Äì 1970 (Population): retrieved September 25, 2013 the members of the committee wanted a common designation to better track the social and economic progress of the group vis-√†-vis the general population. The designation has since been used in local and federal employment, mass media, academia, and business market research. It has been used in the U.S. Census since 1980. Because of the popularity of \\"Latino\\" in the western portion of the United States, the government adopted this term as well in 1997, and used it in the 2000 census. Previously, Hispanic and Latino Americans were categorized as \\"Spanish-Americans\\", \\"Spanish-speaking Americans\\", or \\"Spanish-surnamed Americans\\". However: * Although a large majority of Hispanic and Latino Americans have Spanish ancestry, most are not of direct, \\"from-Spain-to-the-U.S.\\" Spanish descent; many are not primarily of Spanish descent; and some are not of Spanish descent at all. People whose ancestors or who themselves arrived in the United States directly from Spain are a tiny minority of the Hispanic or Latino population (see figures in this article), and there are Hispanic/Latino Americans who are of other European ancestries in addition to Spanish (e.g., Portuguese, Italian, German, and Middle Eastern, such as the Lebanese). Latino denotes \\"the inclusion of the non-Spanish cultures of Latin America that have contributed immensely to the development and structure of present-day Latino cultural groups. These groups may include people of Latin American descent whose cultural heritage may be African, Asian, American Indian or indigenous, Middle Eastern and/or European.\\" * Most Hispanic and Latino Americans can speak Spanish, but not all, and most Spanish-speaking Americans are Hispanic or Latino, but not all. For example, Hispanic/Latino Americans often do not speak Spanish by the third generation, and some Americans who speak Spanish may not identify themselves with Spanish-speaking Americans as an ethnic group. * Not all Hispanic and Latino Americans have Spanish surnames, and most Spanish-surnamed Americans are Hispanic or Latino, but not all, e.g., Filipino surnames. Those without Spanish surnames but of Hispanic or Latino origin include politician Bill Richardson, former National Football League (NFL) star Jim Plunkett, and actress Salma Hayek.  Usage of \\"Hispanic\\"  The term \\"Hispanic\\" has been the source of several debates in the USA. Within the U.S., the term originally referred typically to the Hispanos of New Mexico until the U.S. government used it in the 1970 Census to refer to \\"a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.\\"Cobos, Rub√©n (2003) \\"Introduction,\\" A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; The OMB did not accept the recommendation to retain the single term \\"Hispanic\\". Instead, the OMB has decided that the term should be \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" because regional usage of the terms differs. Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion of the United States. Since the 2000 Census, the identifier has changed from \\"Hispanic\\" to \\"Spanish/Hispanic/Latino\\". Other federal and local government agencies and non-profit organizations include Brazilians and Portuguese in their definition of \\"Hispanic:. The US Department of Transportation defines \\"Hispanic\\" as \\"persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or others [of] Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin, regardless of race.\\" This definition has been adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal, state, and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority-owned businesses. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC)‚Äîwhich was organized in 1976 by five Hispanic Congressmen: Herman Badillo (NY), Baltasar Corrada del R√≠o (PR), Kika de la Garza (TX), Henry B. Gonzalez (TX) and Edward Roybal (CA)‚Äîand the Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese descent. The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Spain, Portugal, and Latin America. The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, which proclaims itself the champion of Hispanic success in higher education, has member institutions in the US, Puerto Rico, Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. In a 2012 study, most Spanish speakers of Spanish or Latin American descent in the United States did not choose to use the terms \\"Hispanic\\" or \\"Latino\\" when describing their identity. Instead, they preferred to be identified by their country of origin. Over half of those surveyed said they had no preference for either term. When forced to choose, 33% chose \\"Hispanic\\" and 14% chose \\"Latino.\\" A study done in 2009 shows that there is not a significant difference between the attitudes or preferences towards the terms among young (18‚Äì25) and older individuals. The statistical numbers are almost identical. Among the overall Hispanic population, young Hispanics prefer to identify themselves with their family's country of origin. Both groups prefer the term \\"American\\" versus \\"Latino/Hispanic\\". Yet, older Hispanics are more likely to identify as white than younger Hispanics. When it comes to the preference of \\"Latino\\" or \\"Hispanic\\", the younger subgroup is more likely to state that it does not matter. If they do have a preference, both groups prefer the term \\"Hispanic\\" rather than \\"Latino\\".  Origin of \\"Latino\\"  The term Latin America was first coined by South Americans in France in the mid-19th century and then by the French as Am√©rique latine, during the time of the French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s. It is a combination of the European prefix \\"latino-\\" and the New World, \\"America\\". It was used to symbolically sever Mexico's Spanish roots, while at the same time, reinforcing a notion of belonging between the two nations. The Latin race, as defined in this context, was composed of all people descending from nations who spoke romance tongues, descending from Latin. Hence, this definition would effectively include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and Spanish peoples etc. as \\"latinos\\" along with the people descended from the Latin colonies. Juan Francisco Martinez wrote that \\"France began talking about Amerique Latine during the rule of Napoleon III as a way of distinguishing between those areas of the Americas originally colonized by Europeans of Latin descent and those colonized by peoples from northern Europe. But the term was used to justify French intervention in the young republics of Latin America.\\"Martinez, Juan Francisco. 2009. \\"Identity (Latino/a vs. Hispanic)\\". Pages 289‚Äì94 in Hispanic American Religious Cultures. Edited by Miguel A. De Fa Torre. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO The adoption of the term \\"Latino\\" by the US Census Bureau in 2000 and its subsequent media attention brought about several controversies and disagreements, specifically in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. Regarding it as an arbitrary, generic term, many Latin American scholars, journalists and organizations have objected to the mass media use of the word \\"Latino\\", pointing out that such ethnonyms are optional and should be used only to describe people involved in the practices, ideologies and identity politics of their supporters. They argue that if \\"Hispanic\\" is an imposed official term, then so is \\"Latino\\", since it was the French who coined the expression \\"Latin America\\" () to refer to the Spanish, French, and Portuguese-speaking countries of the Western Hemisphere, during their support of the Second Mexican Empire.  Distinctions among the terms \\"Latino\\", \\"Latina\\", and \\"Hispanic\\"  Some authorities of American English maintain a distinction between the terms \\"Hispanic\\" and \\"Latino\\": > Though often used interchangeably in American English, Hispanic and Latino > have slightly different ranges of meaning. Hispanic, from the Latin word for > \\"Spain,\\" has the broader reference, potentially encompassing all Spanish- > speaking peoples in both hemispheres and emphasizing the common denominator > of language among communities that might sometimes seem to have little else > in common. Latino‚Äîwhich in Spanish means \\"Latin\\" but in English is probably > a shortening of the Spanish word latinoamericano‚Äîrefers more exclusively to > persons or communities of Latin American Spanish-speaking origin. Of the > two, only Hispanic can be used in referring to Spain and its history and > culture.

But > in recent polls of Americans of Spanish-speaking Latin American ancestry, > Hispanic is still preferred over Latino among those expressing a preference, > while those having no preference constitute a majority overall. The AP Stylebook also distinguishes between the terms. The Stylebook limits \\"Hispanic\\" to persons \\"from‚Äîor whose ancestors were from‚Äîa Spanish-speaking land or culture. Latino and Latina are sometimes preferred\\". It provides a more expansive definition, however, of \\"Latino\\". The Stylebook definition of \\"Latino\\" includes not only persons of Spanish-speaking land or ancestry, but also more generally includes persons \\"from‚Äîor whose ancestors were from‚Äî ... Latin America.\\" The Stylebook specifically lists Brazilians as an example of a group that can be considered Latino. It is important to note the difference between Latino and Latina. Latino is traditionally reserved for males and Latina for females. A group of Latina women is termed \\"Latinas\\", whereas a group of Latino men or a combination of Latino and Latina individuals are designated as \\"Latinos\\" (See Latino (demonym)).  Alternate terms  = Latino/a and Latin@ = Both Latino/a and Latin@ aim to challenge the gender binary that is inherent in Portuguese and Spanish, which combines the Portuguese/Spanish masculine ending \\"o\\" and the feminine \\"a\\". Latin@ has been noted to have the symbolical importance of suggesting inclusiveness, by having the \\"o\\" encircle the \\"a\\", in one character. Latin@ may be used to promote gender neutrality or be used to encompass both Latinos and Latinas without using the masculine \\"Latinos\\" designation for the mixed genders group. = Latinx = The term Latinx was introduced in the early 2000s as a gender- neutral term for Latino/Latina, in addition to encompassing those who identify outside of the gender binary, such as those who are transgender, or those who are gender-fluid. The term has been embraced by the Latin LGBTQ+ communities. The term \\"Latinx\\" reportedly surfaced with LGBTQ+ spaces on the internet in 2004, but use of the term didn't take off until a decade later. The term has drawn criticisms for its invented roots, in addition to its perceived corruption of the Spanish language. Hispanic/Latino ethnic groups The U.S. government has defined \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" persons as being \\"persons who trace their origin [to] ... Central and South America, and other Spanish cultures\\". The Census Bureau's 2010 census provides a definition of the terms \\"Latino\\" and \\"Hispanic\\": \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" refers to a person of Mexican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. It allows respondents to self-define whether they were Latino or Hispanic and then identify their specific country or place of origin. On its website, the Census Bureau defines \\"Hispanic\\" or \\"Latino\\" persons as being \\"persons who trace their origin [to] ... Spanish-speaking Central and South America countries, and other Spanish cultures\\". These definitions thus arguably do not include Brazilian Americans,In contrast, some dictionary definitions may include Brazilian Americans or Brazilian people, or both in general. especially since the Census Bureau classifies Brazilian Americans as a separate ancestry group from \\"Hispanic or Latino\\". A surge of Portuguese- Americans faced a big scare when the Census Bureau revealed plans to categorize people of Portuguese descent as \\"Hispanics\\" in the 2020 National Census. The unified feelings of dispute were displayed in a national survey conducted by Palcus within the Portuguese-American community. The results were an overwhelming 90% of participants objecting to Portuguese-Americans being classified under the Hispanic ethnicity. Fortunately for those opposed to the Portuguese-as-Hispanic classification, the Census Bureau later released an update stating that they never intended to classify people of Portuguese descent as Hispanic in the 2020 National Census. The 28 Hispanic or Latino American groups in the Census Bureau's reports are the following: \\"Mexican,; Central American: Costa Rican, Guatemalan, Honduran, Nicaraguan, Panamanian, Salvadoran, Other Central American; South American: Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Venezuelan, Other South American; Other Hispanic or Latino: Spaniard, Spanish, Spanish American, All other Hispanic\\".  Criticism from the media  In the US, the terms are officially voluntary, self-designated classifications. However, the mass media has helped propagate them irrespective of this fact. The rapid spread of \\"Latino\\" in the US has been possible due to the policies of certain newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and other California-based media during the 1990s. Raoul Lowery Contreras writes: > For years I have campaigned against the Los Angeles Times-imposed word, > \\"Latino\\", in describing the country's fastest growing ethnic \\"Group,\\" those > with Spanish-surnames, those who speak Spanish, et al. The LA Times set its > feet in concrete and the use of the word \\"Latino\\" and nothing has cracked > the concrete since. Worst of all, other newspapers have followed the Times > lead and news coverage, accuracy and the community have suffered. Lowery Contreras argues that, according to the statistics of the Census Bureau, most middle-class people with Latin-American background living in the United States reject the term. He traces the polarization of the word to Los Angeles Times columnist Frank del Olmo, who regarded the term \\"Hispanic\\" as \\"ugly and imprecise\\". He writes: > The third reason Del Olmo objected to the word \\"Hispanic\\" and championed the > word \\"Latino\\" was that \\"Chicano\\" had been roundly rejected by all Mexican > Americans but the most radical, blue collar, less educated, under-class > people of Mexican-origin. Del Olmo pushed \\"Latino\\" as a substitute for the > rejected \\"Chicano.\\" Unfortunately, he was in a position to push this > substitution into the language of the \\"Newspaper of Record\\" in the West. > Other papers and broadcast stations took up the word because it was the > \\"style\\" of the LA Times. Frank Del Olmo single-handedly branded millions of > people.  Latino, Hispanic or national identity  The naming dispute is a phenomenon that has its roots mainly in California and other neighboring states. Before the adoption of the ethnonym \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" by the United States Government, the term Hispanic was commonly used for statistical purposes. However, many people did not feel satisfied with the term and started campaigns promoting the use of \\"Latino\\" as a new ethnonym. The Office of Management and Budget has stated that the new term should be, indeed, \\"Hispanic or Latino\\" because the usage of the terms differs‚Äî\\"Hispanics is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States, whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion\\". (Boldface in the original.) Despite this, debates regarding the proper name of the perceived homogeneous population of US citizens with Latin American or Spanish background still abound, and are even more acute. To find out how much people agree or disagree with either term, many polls have been conducted. According to a December 2000 poll by Hispanic Trends, 65% of the registered voters preferred the word \\"Hispanic\\", while 30% chose to identify themselves as \\"Latino\\". Daniel David Arreola, in his book Hispanic spaces, Latino places: community and cultural diversity in contemporary America, points out that many Latin Americans feel more comfortable identifying themselves with their country of origin: > What most of us know and what the results from the 1992 Latino National > Political survey demonstrate is a preference for place of origin or national > identity in what we call ourselves. Face-to-face interviews of 2,817 people > were conducted in 1989 and 1990. Some 57 percent to 86 percent of Mexicans > and Puerto Ricans‚Äîwhether born in Mexico or born in the United States, > whether born in the island or in the mainland‚Äîpreferred to call themselves > Mexican or Puerto Rican rather than panethnic names like Hispanic or Latino. A Pew Hispanic Center survey conducted November 9 ‚Äì December 7, 2011, and published April 4, 2012, reported: > Nearly four decades after the United States government mandated the use of > the terms \\"Hispanic\\" or \\"Latino\\" to categorize Americans who trace their > roots to Spanish-speaking countries, a new nationwide survey of Hispanic > adults finds that these terms still haven't been fully embraced by Hispanics > themselves. A majority (51%) say they most often identify themselves by > their family's country of origin; just 24% say they prefer a pan-ethnic > label.  Academic opinion and the social sciences  One of the major arguments of people who object to either term is not only the perceived stereotypical overtones they carry, but the unjust and unfair labeling of people who do not even belong to the practices and ideologies of such identities. This is true of many indigenous peoples such as the Wixarikas and the Lacandones, who still practice their own religious rituals without syncretism with Catholic elements. Journalist Juan Villegas writes: > The word 'Latino' may be loaded with negative connotations when used by non- > Latinos in American culture because of its association with the sign 'Latin' > which may imply a stereotyped character partially imposed by Hollywood. > Latino is a sign that needs to be contextualized. It may bring some groups > together, but it also may contribute to depoliticize a movement and to > stereotype a diversity of social groups and cultures. These characteristics that are often used, such as Hollywood, to classify a person of Latina/o culture and identity has been termed by scholars, \\"As a system of media signification, Latinidad is a performative and performed dynamic set of popular signs associated with Latinas/os and Latina/o identity. Common signifiers of Latinidad are language, linguistic accents, religious symbols, tropical and spicy foods, and brown skin as a phenotypic identity.\\" (Berg Ramirez p. 40‚Äì41). As Guzman discusses, \\"signifiers most commonly associated with Latinidad produce a sense of authenticity within media texts\\", (p. 235). Ramirez continues to discuss how these signifiers of Latinidad do not necessarily mean they are stereotypical. In actuality, Latina/os may utilize these \\"signifiers\\" for self-identifying purposes. In terms of media portrayal, Hollywood has invested a lot of time and money to develop a general notion of \\"Latinidad\\" because marketers, advertisers and media content producers have found that they are a very bankable demographic, thus turned \\"Latinidad\\" and Latina/o culture and identity to a commodity. What is problematic about this is when creating this general notion, the diversity within this demographic becomes suppressed and flattened in a demographic that is very heterogeneous just so marketers, advertisers and media content producers can communicate their version of \\"authentic\\" racial identity to consumers. Consequently, this opens the space for stereotypes to be created and perpetuated. Others, such as Catherine Alexandra Carter and Rodolfo Acu√±a, address the issue from a more global and political perspective, stressing the importance of terms like \\"Latino\\" or \\"Hispanic\\" for the marketing industry and for statistical ends: > The terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino', although first created for the purpose of > lumping together a diverse group of people and making them more economically > marketable, have grown into something far more significant. Over time the > legitimacy and accuracy of these terms have come to influence not only the > functioning of the marketing industry, but the organization and structure of > many other aspects of life. > When and why the Latino identity came about is a more involved story. > Essentially, politicians, the media, and marketers find it convenient to > deal with the different U.S. Spanish-speaking people under one umbrella. > However, many people with Spanish surnames contest the term \\"Latino\\". They > claim it is misleading because no Latino or Hispanic nationality exists > since no Latino state exists, so generalizing the term \\"Latino\\" slights the > various national identities included under the umbrella. Davila expands on the ramifications of the mass media's dominant use of \\"Latino\\" or \\"Hispanic\\" to categorize this demographic, \\"... the extent to which assertions of cultural differences intersect with dominant norms of American citizenship that give preeminence to white, monolingual, middle-class producers of and contributors to a political body defined in national terms. My concern is ... with how notions of citizenship, belonging, and entitlement are directly intertwined and predicated on dominant U.S. nationalist categories. Such categories conflate race, culture, and language with nationality, establishing the hierarchies and coordinates against which cultural and linguistic differences are ultimately evaluated (Ong 1999; Williams 1989). It is therefore these hierarchies that frame the discourses of Latinidad channeled in the media, as well as the media's treatment of language and what it may potentially communicate to and about Latino's claim to belonging, and in what terms they may or may not be within the political community of the United States.\\" Consequently, this may leave issues, concerns, and topics relevant to this demographic left unheard, discussed and addressed. They are left invisible, therefore not only conflating the cultural differences, but also marginalizing them for the sake of convenience and marketability to the mass media. However, this is not to say this is a monolithic issue. Instead, this further gives incentive for the demographic to create a space in which they can transform these notions where the representations are more diverse, complex and authentic. Not everyone rejects the terms and in fact feel that this idea of Latinidad is taken for granted. G. Christina Mora, author and UC Berkeley sociologist professor emphasizes the importance of the Hispanic term. In her book, \\"Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American\\" she explains the origins of the term and how it positively unites Hispanics. The term officially came into existence through United States government but it was due to an activist movement. Before this term, groups such as Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans were only accounted for in census data as \\"white\\". The lack of specific data tied to Hispanics failed to show their social circumstance and therefore could not create necessary changes. There was no data to back up that they were significantly being affected by poverty, discrimination, and disadvantageous education. Without data, Hispanics would not receive adequate funding to change their circumstances and future. Due to the activism on behalf of Chicano and Puerto Rican individuals, there is data that supports and unites a group towards social equality. Mora, states the following about the term and what she hopes it will mean for her daughter: \\"I hope that my daughter will be conscious that the idea of Latino/Hispanic was actually rooted in an effort to work for social justice and political inclusion. Though we are a diverse community, many still grapple with disadvantage, discrimination and underrepresentation. All in all, I hope my daughter will embrace her Latinidad by being conscious of its roots in social justice and by continuing the cause of civil rights and political participation in America.\\"  See also  *Hispanic and Latino Americans *Media bias *Native American name controversy *Naming controversy *Race and ethnicity in Latin America  References  Further reading  External links  *Los Angeles Times ‚Äì Look beyond the 'Latino' label *The Term 'Latino' Describes No One *Latino or Hispanic Panic: Which Term Should We Use? *Yale University ‚Äì Understanding Ethnic Labels and Puerto Rican Identity *Latino Times has 20-1 ratio of the use of \\"Latino\\" over \\"Hispanic\\" from news articles worldwide. * Category:Hispanic and Latino Category:Hispanidad Category:Latin American studies Category:Mass media-related controversies in the United States Category:Naming controversies ","title":"Hispanic and Latino (ethnic categories)"},{"id":"23181144","text":"Agirda (; ) is a Turkish Cypriot village in the Kyrenia District of Cyprus.

It is now an astronomy-themed visitor centre and museum.  History  The Helsinki astronomical observatory was designed in cooperation by professor Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander and architect Carl Ludvig Engel. The building was finished in 1834. Its instruments and astronomical books had escaped the great fire in Turku and were then transferred to Helsinki. The observatory was among the most modern astronomical observatories of its time, and served as an example for several European observatories that were built afterwards, most notably Pulkovo Observatory. A separate tower was built in the observatory garden for a telescope designed for astrophotography. This building was finished in 1890. It houses the double refractor: two 0.33 meter refractor telescopes mounted together. One of the telescopes is built to be fitted with an eyepiece and the other with a photographic plate. The observatory is located in the city centre and has not been in active use since the mid-20th century. Another observatory with a 60-centimeter telescope was built in Mets√§hovi, Kirkkonummi in the 1970s. The Mets√§hovi Radio Observatory was built around the same time and is the centre for the radio astronomical research of Aalto University. The Department of Astronomy was merged into the Department of Physics at the beginning of 2010 and the astronomers moved to the Kumpula campus. The observatory building was thoroughly renovated and re-opened as a museum and visitor centre in 2012. The building also now houses the amateur astronomy association Ursa.

Nielsen was employed by the newspaper for 33 years and served in several capacities, including as a correspondent, foreign correspondent, chief editorial writer, editorial page editor, investigative reporter and editorial page columnist. Born in Plaster Rock, New Brunswick, to Danish immigrants Hans and Camilla Nielsen. He led New Brunswick in high school entrance examinations in 1936 and won a Lord Beaverbrook scholarship to the University of New Brunswick in 1940. He left UNB in 1943 to join the Canadian Press in Toronto, where he received basic training in editing and writing for newspapers. In 1945, he began a 33-year career with the Toronto Star during which he was successively a general reporter, Parliamentary correspondent, chief editorial writer, editorial page editor, foreign correspondent based in London and Washington, acting editor-in-chief and editorial page columnist. Some of his foreign assignments included South Africa's racial conflict, the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, Sweden's welfare state, Israel's in-gathering of Jews and the refugee influx to Hong Kong from Communist China. Nielsen was awarded a Nieman Fellowship to Harvard University in 1952 and a National Newspaper Award for Enterprise Reporting (now categorized as Investigations) in 1974. While on vacation in New Brunswick in 1965, Nielsen learned that a ratepayers' meeting had voted to expel all 45 Malecite children from a Perth-Andover school--for no more substantial reason than their race. His reports to the Toronto Star led to national publicity and a second, much larger meeting of rate-payers who voted by a big majority to readmit the children. Robert Nielsen left the Star in 1978 and moved to the Perth-Andover, New Brunswick area where he continued his career as a freelance writer and pursued part-time studies at the University of Maine at Presque Isle, graduating with a Bachelor of Liberal Studies in 1990. During this time, Nielsen was a columnist for the Telegraph-Journal of Saint John, New Brunswick and also for Influence magazine. He died at age 87 after suffering an aneurysm.
