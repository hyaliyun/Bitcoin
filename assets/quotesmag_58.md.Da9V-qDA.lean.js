It is recognized as a University College of Merit by the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities, and Research as an institution with a high-quality educational offer pursuing merit and interdisciplinary learning. History The Collegio follows the tradition of the halls of residence that have been spreading across Europe since the end of the Middle Ages. In Italy, the University colleges of merit are high-quality catered institutions that provide an educational program that integrates and complements the University program aimed at students with high potential selected on academic merits. The Collegio di Milano opened its doors on 29 September 2003 and was founded by Milan's seven Universities (University of Milano, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Bocconi University, Polytechnic University of Milan, University of Milano-Bicocca, IULM University of Milan, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University) and other public and private institutions. Students should be enrolled in one those seven Universities, but students enrolled in the Milan Conservatory, the Brera Academy, the Humanitas University, the Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti, the Istituto Europeo di Design, and the Scuola Politecnica di Design can also be considered. Since the admission is based on merit only, studentships are also available. The Collegio is run by the Fondazione Collegio delle Università Milanesi, a nonprofit institution owned by Milan's seven Universities, local governments (e.g., the City of Milan, the Region Lombardy) and private entities (e.g., Pirelli, Mediaset, Intesa Sanpaolo). The Philosophy of the Collegio Each year, the Collegio di Milano hosts 120 students, undergraduate and graduate, admitted through an open competition based on academic grades and talents, who enjoy, in addition to room and board, a set of academic and pastoral services such as study rooms, junior and senior common rooms, tutorships, mentorships, conferences, libraries, digital technologies, gym and sport facilities, honours programs, international exchanges, coaching and career services, volunteer experiences, and an overall academic environment that promotes a balanced and multidisciplinary education. To remain a resident of the Collegio, each student should abide by specific duties such as being on track in his or her academic studies, maintaining an average of marks at least 27/30 (an average University GPA of 3.7) and following the educational program of the Collegio. To each student who has successfully completed the College program, the Collegio releases a College Diploma. The campus The campus comprises buildings for 8,000 square- meters, designed by Marco Zanuso, and a 30,000 square-meters park. The buildings were raised between 1971 and 1974 for a center dedicated to African countries and restored on several occasions. The buildings remind the brutalist style of Andrew Melville Hall by James Sterling at the University of St Andrews.

During her attendance at the School of Irish Learning in 1906 and 1907, Joynt developed an interest in the revival of the Irish language. She studied Old and Middle Irish, palaeography and Welsh at the School. From 1907 to 1908, she enrolled in a Celtic Studies course by Kuno Meyer at the University of Liverpool. In January 1909, Joynt was appointed alongside Mary E. Byrne as assistants working on the Dictionary of Old Irish in Royal Irish Academy. The 1932 second fascicule (letter E) was arranged by Joynt and Eleanor Knott. She went on to arrange M (1939), N O P (1941), and R (1944), and collaborate with others on S (1953). In 1911 she entered \\"disenfranchised\\" as her disability and despite her brother being a Methodist minister the census return recorded her religion as \\"no church\\". The enumerator tried to \\"correct\\" some of her details although she recorded that she could speak English and with modesty \\"some Irish\\" as she was working on the Irish Dictionary. She went on to edit two volumes in the Mediaeval and Modern Irish Series: Tromdámh Gùaire (1932) and Feis Tighe Chonáin (1936). She also contributed to Alexandra College Magazine, Celtica, Celtic Review, Ériu, and New Ireland Review. Joynt was one of the contributor's of Kuno Meyer's 1912 Miscellany edited by Osborn Bergin and Carl Marstrander. Joynt was involved in the Irish Women’s Franchise League and Irish Women’s Progressive Union. From 1902, Joynt was an active committee member of the Women Graduates and Candidate Graduates Association, a group advocating for women's rights in higher education. She served as the honorary secretary from 1907 to 1913. She resigned in 1913 due to her own work load, with the group disbanding in the same year. Joynt was accepted into the Gorsedd at an Eisteddfod, for her contributions for Celtic scholarship. She was awarded a Doctor of Letters by the National University of Ireland in 1937 for her scholarly work and her advocacy of women in university education. Joynt was a supporter of the Irish literary revival, a regular attendee of the early Abbey Theatre and lectures of the Irish Literary Society. Later life and legacy Over the course of her life, Joynt had become a vegetarian, Buddhist, and feminist. Joynt went deaf in old age, but she continued studying until her death. She lived most of her adult life in Ranelagh and Rathmines, but her last address was 69 St Stephens Green. Joynt died on 24 July 1940, in a Portobello nursing home. She is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.

It is located 2.3 miles south of Three Fingers in the Boulder River Wilderness on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The mountain's name came from old miners in the Silverton area. Climate Liberty Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

She is also Director of the Centre for Statistics in Medicine and a Professor of Rehabilitation at the University of Warwick.  Early life and education  Lamb graduated in 1986 from the University of Salford School of Physiotheraphy. For her postgraduate studies she moved to the University of Southampton, where she completed a Masters in Rehabilitation. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of Oxford, working with John Grimley Evans on the mobility of frail elderly people.  Research and career  After completing her PhD, Lamb joined the National Institute on Aging as a Harkness Fellow. She completed a degree in statistics at the University of Sheffield, and was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. She is a member of the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term Follow- up, Improving the Quality of Research in Surgery (IDEAL) collaboration. In 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recognised Lamb as one of the top 200 investigators contributing to health research in the UK. In 2009 she was appointed chair of the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Commissioning Board. Lamb is a medical researcher at the University of Oxford. She is committed to improving the quality of medical trials to ensure better patient outcomes and value for money. Her career involves both clinical trials and musculoskeletal rehabilitation. She works on interventions that can improve the function of elderly people with cognitive impairments and comorbidities. She is particularly interested in minimally invasive approaches to target geriatric syndromes and manage severe injury. These include the rehabilitation of chronic conditions and non-medical healthcare contact. Lamb leads the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences at the University of Oxford. In 2009 she identified that cast worn below the knee could improve severe ankle sprains, which account for 1.5 million emergency room attendances per year in the UK. In 2011 she was part of a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline on the management of hip fractures. In 2012 she founded the Rehab Research lab group at the University of Oxford. She looked at various treatments for Whiplash and found that whilst physiotherapy has short-term benefits, including improvement of neck mobility, it is not cost- effective. She appeared on the Association of Trauma and Orthopaedic Chartered Physiotherapists Physio Matters Podcast in 2015. She believes that physios should be challenging low-quality, flawed, clinical trials and improve medical practice. She identified that a hand exercise programme improves quality and function for Rheumatoid arthritis patients. She has also found that education and targeted training can improve the physical activity of patients with lower back pain. =Awards and honours= In 2016 Lamb was elected as Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci). She was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Brunel University London. Lamb is a trustee of Arthritis Research UK.

Adan's GBV team has faced many obstacles in obtaining justice for Somali victims of gender violence. A shortage of sufficiently trained police officers to respond to GBV cases, a low numbers of female police officers, lack of confidence in the Somali judicial system, and fear of retaliation by perpetrators, prevent many victims from reporting GBV crimes. In 2014, the UK government in support of Somali non-government humanitarian organizations, provided funding to SSWC and other South-Central Somali based organizations as part of £1 million of UK spending on projects to prevent sexual violence across Somalia. The funds began initially with providing basic services for victims. \\"Projects focus on training and capacity building including health workers, providing psychosocial, legal, and economic support and raising awareness through education.\\" Funding from the UK was supplemented with additional funding and support from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA/USAID) in 2015.

Five insurance firms dominate the sector, four of which are active in commercial insurance. The leading player is the Iran Insurance Company, followed by the Asia Insurance Company, the Alborz Insurance Company and the Dana Insurance Company. Export and Investment Insurance deals with foreign trade. Insurance companies Asia, Dana and Alborz will be listed on the stock exchange in 2009 after review and improvement in their financial accounts, internal regulations and organizational structure nationwide. History =2006= In 2006 the market share for private insurance companies stood at 54% and 46% for governmental insurance companies. At the end of 2008, there were 20 insurance firms active in the market, only 4 of which were state-owned (with a 75% market share). As of 2014, twenty-five insurance companies are active in Iran and all, except one, are privately owned. Parsian Insurance became the largest privately owned company to be listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange in 2010. Parisan is the third largest insurance provider in Iran. =2008= In 2008, the total insurance premiums generated in Iran were $4.3 billion. This is less than 0.1% of the world's total, while Iran has approximately 1% of the world's population. The insurance penetration rate is approximately 1.4%, significantly below the global average of 7.5%. This underdevelopment is also evident in product diversity. =2012= Approximately 60% of all insurance premiums are generated from car insurance. There are about 14 million vehicles in Iran and 90 percent of them are insured (2012).http://www.menafn.com/menafn/1ec8e7dd-3f3b-4244-b315-17c982b00e12/Irans- insurance-industry-ready-to-cover-foreign-oil-tankers?src=main Of the 10 million motorcycles that operate on Iran's roads only 2 million are insured. Also, 95% of all premiums come from general insurance contracts and only 5% relate to life products (against world average of 58% for life insurance in 2011). One of the defining characteristics of the economy is entrenched high inflation (and expectations) thanks to persistent monetisation of fiscal deficits. This produces an environment in which no prudent person would enter into a long-term savings contract. According to Business Monitor International, unless and until economic policies in Iran change radically, the reality of the insurance sector will fall a long way short of its potential.http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2199734/iran_insurance_report_q3_2012 =2011, 2012= Blood money was $67,500 in 2011, down from $90,000 a year before. Since 2012, Iran is insuring its own fleet of oil tankers because of international sanctions. Payout ratio Payout ratios have shown consistent growth over the years. Last year, the industry average payout ratio was 86%. Iran has 2 re-insurers. Insurance premiums come to just below 1% of GDP. This is partly attributable to low average income per head. In 2001/02 third-party liability insurance accounted for 46% of premiums, followed by health insurance (13%), fire insurance (around 10%) and life insurance (9.9%). The Central Insurance of Iran is currently in the process of implementing some deregulation within the industry and migrating from a tariff-based regulation regime to a prudential based one (such as the Solvency regime), which is in line with the internationally accepted standards. Insurance industry’s payout ratio stood at 63.8% during the fiscal year ended in March 2016. Insurers' generated premiums totaled $6.5 billion during the said period. Iran Insurance Company, the only state-owned firm, accounted for 39.47% of the premium. Asia Insurance and Alborz Insurance trail by a big margin behind IIC, holding 10.15% and 7.56% of the market’s share, respectively. Auto liability Third-part auto liability accounted for 37.6% of insurance firms’ total generated premiums during the year ended in March 2016, with insurers selling about 19.18 million auto policies in the period. As of 2014 total (non-life) market premium was 1.27% of GDP with only $69 per capita spent on insurance. International As of 2016, Norway's Skuld (shipping), UK's Steamship Mutual and Standard Club (shipping), Protection and Indemnity (P&I;) clubs (shipping), France's Coface (export guarantee agency), Italy's SACE (export credit agency), Germany's Hermes (export credit agency), Austria's OeKB (export credit agency) and Switzerland's SERV (export credit agency) are back doing business in Iran. Many large reinsurance companies are also considering returning to Iran (including Lloyd's, Allianz, Zurich Insurance, Hannover Re and RSA).

It was designed by Howard Joseland and Walter Liberty Vernon and built in 1909. The original hospital buildings and gatehouse were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  David Berry Hospital was established as a result of a bequest left to the people of Berry by David Berry, who died in 1899. Berry left £100,000 \\"for the purpose of erecting a hospital for diseases for the benefit particularly of inhabitants of Broughton Creek and the District of Shoalhaven\\". A temporary hospital was established but proved inadequate, so the state government passed the David Berry Hospital Act 1906 providing for the construction of a permanent hospital and requiring its construction within ten years. In return, upon a commitment to \\"provide and maintain for all time\\" a hospital in the Berry district, David Berry's trustees gave the state government 88 acres of land at North Sydney. The hospital was opened on 18 September 1909 by Premier of New South Wales Charles Wade. The cost of construction was £7,900. The hospital was expanded in 1921, with additions to the sanitary index attached to the isolation wards, and again in 1936, when an \\"Aborigines ward\\", a maternity ward adjoining the women's ward and a small general purposes ward adjoining the men's ward were added. It was renovated in part in 1975. Services The hospital today provides rehabilitation and palliative care services to the Shoalhaven district. It has 26 inpatient beds, with 17 beds for rehabilitation patients and 9 for palliative care patients. The Karinya Palliative Care Unit is located in a standalone building in the hospital grounds.  Heritage listing  David Berry Hospital Precinct is of State heritage significance for its historical association with David Berry. It is also of architectural and aesthetic significance for is association with designer Colonial Architect Walter Liberty Vernon and Howard Joseland. The listing includes the central main building and gatehouse. The central main building is of two storey construction and flanked either side by single storey wings. The gate house is also of note. It is constructed in red brick with a slate roof. The upper section is stucco on a sandstone base with stucco decorative detailing.

Russo (; born January 19, 1968) is an American trial lawyer of Sicilian and Cuban heritage from New York. He handles complex business litigation in state and federal courts throughout the United States, and other matters pending in administrative and alternative dispute resolution forums. He has handled bet-the-company litigations, complicated commercial disputes, financial services litigation, regulatory defense, white collar defense, corporate compliance and internal investigations for publicly held and private companies in the United States and abroad. Education Russo attended the Regis High School. He earned his law degree, cum laude, from Harvard Law School and received a BA, magna cum laude, in the field of economics from Yale University. =Early Experience= Advocacy While at Harvard Law he joined TAP, the Tenant Advocacy Program. He tried 13 cases before the Cambridge Rent Control Board, advocating for local Bostonians who were being displaced. In his second year, he became the co-chairman of TAP, while also joining the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. During his second and third year in law school, Russo litigated for disadvantaged people, dealing with problems such as housing and social security disability issues. Before graduating Russo appeared before the Massachusetts Appeals Court twice on emergency appeals and obtained stays of eviction orders that threatened to displace his indigent clients. Litigation =Commercial= Russo represents individuals and entities in multi-jurisdictional commercial litigation. In recent years he has represented the interests of translation services CEO Philip Shawe, supermodel Irina Shayk, baritone Daniil Alekseenko, Hollywood producer and talent manager Stella Bulochnikov and the family of Georgian-born businessman Arkady “Badri” Patarkatsishvili. =SEC Regulation= He is experienced in counseling clients on arbitrations, disciplinary actions, and investigations and enforcement proceedings initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice, as well as self-regulatory organizations. He has worked on many FINRA disciplinary hearings and securing exceptional settlements. He also has significant experience representing clients in high-stakes criminal matters and has obtained numerous favorable outcomes. He has been an advocate on arbitrations and disciplinary proceedings. =Securities and FINRA related Work= After Black Monday, the NASDAQ introduced a system known as the Small Order Execution System (SOES), which forced market makers—firms that continually buy and sell stocks at listed prices—to execute electronically placed orders of up to 1000 shares at whatever price was posted. Datek trader Sheldon Maschler and Datek Online founder Jeffrey A. Citron engineered a computer program to spot market spreads that offered customers an arbitrage opportunity when market maker spreads were slow to adjust. With that tool Datek traders with customer orders were able to get a guaranteed execution on up to 1000 shares by pressing a button. Datek's people figured out a way to do that thousands of times a day, taking advantage of the posted listings that had not been updated. The firm and the traders were ultimately stopped and fined. Russo was hired from school to represent Sheldon Maschler, the 'Bad Boy' of Wall Street, and another of Datek traders in a disciplinary case surrounding this matter and later became the lead counsel for Datek and all of the traders who were charged with wrongdoing. After 27 hearing days (stretched to over more than a year of litigation), Russo's defense forced a settlement which permitted Datek to continue in the SOES business. Under the terms of the settlement, Citron and Maschler acknowledged no wrongdoing paid a minimal fine and took limited suspensions. Russo next represented Wall Street short seller John Fiero when the National Association of Securities Dealers threatened to bar him from the securities industry. That representation continued for years and ultimately culminated in the landmark Second Circuit opinion Fiero v. NASD, in which the court held that FINRA as a quasi-governmental organization could not utilize the courts collect fines it assesses against its members thereby limiting the self-regulatory body's remedies to expulsion. Russo represented Key West Securities founder and short seller Amr Ibrahim Elgindy in connection with two NASD disciplinary proceedings. Russo's work helped Elgindy prevail in both disciplinary matters – a feat that has not yet been repeated by any single respondent. Following the appeals, the SEC issued a precedent-setting ruling which permanently established that the introduction of properly obtained accurate information into the marketplace is not a manipulation even if intended to affect the price of a security for profit. In 2001, Russo represented broker-dealer D.L. Cromwell Investments, Inc. and its principals in a lawsuit against NASD Regulation Inc. seeking to enjoin the regulatory body from compelling the individual plaintiffs to testify in an investigation under the threat of expulsion for asserting their U.S. Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination in response to questions because the regulator was working directly with the federal government. The case alleged that a federal Grand Jury subpoena which directed responsive materials to be produced to Criminal Prosecution Assistance Group of the NASD made the entity a state actor on behalf of federal prosecutors. Judge Lewis Kaplan initially dismissed the case, but later sat a motion to renew and reargue based on newly discovered evidence (an NASD informant's sworn statement) for more than a year until the principals were indicted by the federal government so that he could deny the motion as moot. The principals ultimately pled guilty to federal crimes and with Russo's representation were given sentences of probation with restitution. As a result of the DL Cromwell case, the U.S. Department of Justice was forced to alter the way it interacted with the quasi-governmental NASD Regulation, now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). in 2011, Russo worked with entrepreneur Daniel Staton to recover $8.1M from Merrill Lynch in $1 billion FINRA REIT Arbitration stemming from an alleged illegal seizure and theft of 1,260,000 shares of Duke Realty Corporation common stock from Staton's accounts. Commercial Cases =TransPerfect= Russo successfully represented Philip Shawe to victory in the Delaware Chancery Court after that court had for the first time in history ordered the draconian remedy of a forced sale of a successful private company against the wishes of half of the shareholders. With Russo serving as the lead, Kruzhkov Russo and a team of co-counsel from other law firms navigated the negative allegations made by Shawe's former business partner Elizabeth Elting and secured approval of the sale of TransPerfect Global, Inc. to Mr. Shawe. The irony of the case noted by Chancellor Andre Bouchard is that “the undercurrent of [Ms. Elting’s] opposition to approval of the sale which she requested, reflects an apparent, deep-seated frustration with the fact that the winner of the auction was Shawe.” By Order dated May 3, 2018, written by Chief Justice Strine, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the judgment of the Chancery Court. =Little Rest Twelve and Fisher Island Investments= Russo, represented Inna Gudavadze, the widow of Georgian billionaire and philanthropist Badri Patarkatsishvili. Gudavadze was named in a wrongful death lawsuit, which alleged that she conspired with former Russian \\"oligarch\\" Boris Berezovsky to kill Mr. Patarkatsishvili to seize his fortune. Russo successfully defended the action and obtained a dismissal with prejudice. Following Patarkatsishvili's death, several of his business associates made fraudulent attempts to claim his business assets from family. A man named Joseph Kay, the stepson of Patarkatsishvili's aunt and someone who had worked with him, along with the American lawyer, Emmanuel Zeltser, attempted to take control of Gudavadze's assets, including a restaurant in Manhattan named Ajna Bar and a large development on Fisher Island in Florida. On March 31, 2010, Russo, with Jean-Yves Haouzi, a Buddha Bar executive and part owner of Little Rest Twelve, and a security team, walked into Ajna Bar (formerly Buddha Bar NYC) and locked out Joseph Kay, his sister Nina and his son David. The NYPD was called to the scene and ordered Nina and her managers off the premises. By presenting corporate documentation, and having filed a lawsuit the same morning, Russo convinced the police to eject all of the Kay parties. Gudavadze's family then took control of the restaurant. In the court battle that followed, there was a legal question regarding whether Russo and his firm could replace Emanuel Zeltser as counsel to Little Rest Twelve. Because Russo was attempting to change the status quo, he had the burden to prove that his client owned LR12. Russo met the court's burden. He later also prevailed in his lawsuit against the Kays and the restaurant was awarded $3.7 million which the Kays had misappropriated after Badri's death. A similar corporate battle ensued with respect to the development rights to Fisher Island. When Patarkatsishvili died, Kay attempted to fire his fellow officers in Fisher Island Holdings. Kay argued that he could not be forced out of power, and during a trip to Georgia, the locks were changed to the management offices and social club. Russo, together with a team of bankruptcy and other lawyers in Florida, obtained a definitive ruling in federal court that the development rights belonged trusts that had been established by Badri for the benefit of Gudavdze and her family. Russo and his team managed to obtain a $100,000+ court sanction of Emanual Zelster and, in another Gudavadze asset related case, a possibly career-ending NY Supreme Court judgment that the attorney had misappropriated millions of dollars of funds held in his attorney escrow account. Personal Russo was born and raised in New York. He plays soccer and supports soccer-related endeavors. He is the President S.C. Eintracht, of the Cosmopolitan Soccer League, one of New York's oldest soccer clubs, and a USSF licensed coach who presently trains two adult men's amateur soccer teams.

It was built from 1860 to 1861 by stonemason Charles Moore and carpenter Willet Burry. It was also known as Greenhills and Warragee during its homestead era, as Prague Lodge while it was a function centre, and later as the now-defunct Nowra Bomaderry Leagues Club. The property is owned by Shoalhaven City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 June 2004.  History  ;Historical context for Graham Lodge Aboriginal people are understood to have inhabited the Shoalhaven region for at least 21,000 years.Goulding & Schell, 2002, 29 Sue Wesson's atlas (2000) identified the language spoken by Aboriginal groups in the Shoalhaven as Tharawal, suggesting they would have identified with the Wodi Wodi people, who formed part of the Yuin linguistic group.Goulding & Schell, 2002, 16 Europeans were slow to settle the Shoalhaven area because of sand and surf obstructing the opening of the river, first noted by George Bass in 1797. The first documented European visitors to the region were Lieutenant Kent and G. Evans, who anchored their boat at Jervis Bay in 1805 and walked to the Shoalhaven, some 30 kilometres to the south, where they found a small boat (presumably made by Aboriginal people) and used it to explore the river. From 1811 cedar- cutters began transporting wood from the Shoalhaven to Sydney by boat but encountered resistance from local Aboriginal people, on whom they were reported to have had \\"corrupting influence\\". Several landholdings along the Shoalhaven were granted for agricultural and pastoral estates in the early nineteenth century. By 1822 when Alexander Berry settled as the first documented settler in the region, the cedar-cutters no longer frequented the area \\"as the natives either killed all the sawyers or forced them away\\". Berry left detailed notes about individual Aboriginal people he encountered and customs he observed, including comments on five clans associated with the lower Shoalhaven: the Shoalhaven, the Numba, the Broughton Creek, the Woregy and the Murroo. Berry estimated the population of these clans for the Census of 1834 at 150 people, however these numbers would have already been affected by disease and displacement.Goulding & Schell, 2002, 16-19 According to Goulding and Schell (2002, 20) Berry's estate: :'relied enormously on Aboriginal labour. . . Showing Berry where to locate his farm, cutting roads, (enabling Berry to bring cattle form Illawarra), conveying stores up the hill to his house, undertaking domestic chores, crewing his vessel and assisting in bringing down cattle from Sydney.' In 1843 William Graham's early home at Greenhills was noted as the only residence in the vicinity of present-day Nowra. By 1856 Greenhills supported five stores, at least three hotels, a butcher and slaughtering business, a post office, school, church and private burial ground.(Illawarra Mercury 30 June 1856) The government town of Nowra was surveyed in the 1850s but only became the main settlement in the area after 1870 when a series of floods encouraged a general shift away from the riverside settlements. The construction of a bridge across the Shoalhaven in 1881 brought the main road into the district near to the house, while urbanisation and economic expansion increased after 1893 with the establishment of a railway connection to Sydney terminating at Bomaderry, just over the bridge. ;Establishing Greenhills In 1826, just four years after Berry, emancipated convict William Graham arrived in the Shoalhaven together with his wife Margaret and children Jane, William, John and James, and took up the unoccupied Butler's Grant of 100 acres (40 hectares) on the southern banks of the Shoalhaven, in a holding that became known as Greenhills (it has also been called Warragee).HO & DUAP, 1996, 188 The following year Graham's two sons, William and James, took up John Layton's unoccupied 640 acre (286 hectare) land grant adjoining Butler's Grant, significantly expanding the Greenhills estate. The land adjoined Prosper de Mestre's small estate of Terara and Alexander Berry's huge estate of Jindyandy/Pyree (which had increased from an original grant of 14,000 acres or 6,257 hectares to 75,000 or 30,351 hectares in 1890). The 1828 NSW Census records William Graham living in the Illawarra, on land including 50 acres (20 hectares) that were cleared and 20 acres (8 hectares) cultivated; he had 50 head of cattle (1828 Census of NSW, Archives Office NSW). His letter of 1829 to the colonial secretary Alexander McLeay explained: :'It is now three years or thereabouts since first settled myself here for the purpose of being near my two sons, who had previously obtained orders for a small grant of land each and I have already been at a considerable expense in clearing off the land, erecting a cottage, and making stockyards etc and I have hitherto succeeded in procuring a small herd of cattle and cultivating a small portion of land for the support of my family. . .' (3-D exhibitions, 2000, 15) To help clear and cultivate the land, some of the property was leased to tenant farmers brought out by Graham from Britain in 1841. Heritage Archaeology state that: :'Entries in the Greenhills Account Book relate the association of William and James Graham with many bounty immigrant families living in tenanted houses on the Graham's Greenhills estate. . . These families included domestic servants, blacksmiths, tanners, brick-makers and labourers. Their physical contribution to the development of Greenhills was substantial. Several historical paintings by Samuel Elyard depict the Greenhills estate and the outbuildings. . . The Greenhills cultural landscape represents an example of the early and ambitious attempts at settlement on the south coast of New South Wales'.Heritage Archaeology, 2002 Several sources of information do suggest that Greenhills was a contact site between Europeans and Aboriginal people in the area. These sources include: archaeological evidence of flaked tools being found in the same or higher ground level as European implements, paintings depicting Aboriginal people camped in the Graham Lodge area, a contemporary historical account of Aboriginal people being employed and working on the property and historical accounts of Aboriginal people being present on the property.Heritage Archaeology, 2000 Although there are no entries in the Greenhills Account Book 1848-1854 indicating any transactions with Aboriginal people, Heritage Archaeology suggests that economic exchanges probably took place under barter agreements, possibly exchanging labour for sugar, tobacco, flour or blankets.Heritage Archaeology, 2002, 24 On the other hand, there is documented evidence that the original grantee, emancipist William Graham, had abusive relationships with Aboriginal people before his time at Greenhills. Heritage Archaeology reports that the Colonial Secretary Index 1788-1825 for 5 June 1822 made several references to his earlier activities at Five Islands, Illawarra: * \\"MURRAY, Aborigine; of Five Islands, Illawarra; Assisting William Graham to track Aborigines\\". * 'CONTA CONTA, Aborigine of Five Islands, Illawarra, who was accused of stealing corn, and was maimed by William Graham.' * 'NOLLOGER, Aborigine of Five Islands, Illawarra. Mentioned in the deposition of William Graham [Jnr.] re charges against his father, William Graham, for maiming a black native. Graham severed the hand of an Aborigine who subsequently died.'Heritage Archaeology, 2002, 25 No such records of any similar incidents have so far been found in relation to the Greenhills estate. ;Building Graham Lodge The original grantee William Graham died at Greenhills in September 1852 and was buried in the family cemetery. After his father's death, James Graham took over the running of the estate and, as executor of his father's will, divided the estate between the family members. James retained the original 100 acre grant and house, and he and his wife Mary (née Gardner) purchased more land at Greenhills and nearby. James and Mary had six children and it was soon apparent that the older house was too small for his growing family. James contracted Charles Moore, stonemason and bricklayer, and Willet Burrey, carpenter, of Nowra, to erect a new house on the estate. It was commenced in January 1860 and completed in May 1861. James was elected to the first Shoalhaven council in 1859 and became its first Mayor in 1860.Freeman, 2001 Graham's powerful neighbours, the Berrys, had opposed the formation of this municipal government.HO & DUAP, 1996, 189 The 1997 Shoalhaven Heritage Study identified the majority of early buildings in the Shoalhaven district as being of vernacular idiom and form. The introduction of architectural concepts and design by recognised architects such as Thomas Rowe, John Horbury Hunt, Howard Joseland and Cyril Blacket began only in the 1870s with the construction of a number of churches by Horbury Hunt in Kangaroo Valley and Nowra. \\"Polite\\" residential design as opposed to vernacular design does not appear to have begun in recognisable form until the 1860s. The two storey veranda form of Graham Lodge would appear to be the earliest example in Shoalhaven. Similar two storey buildings with two storey verandas were soon erected nearby including Bundanon in 1866 and Boolgatta in 1870. Although modified and adapted Graham Lodge is a late example of the Victorian Georgian style with Regency influences. The use of slates in the roof was probably the earliest in Shoalhaven and reflects the aspiration to express quality and permanency in all parts of the building. This is also evident in the quality of the remnant internal cedar joinery, the design of the principle elevations, the use of the two storey veranda form and the massing and scale of the building.Freeman, SHI, 2000 James Graham (Senior) died on 24 July 1867 aged 66 and was buried in the family cemetery. Following the death of his 16-year-old son John four months later, James Graham [Junior] took over the running of the farm at Greenhills. He married Emily Ann Hewitt on 15 August 1871 and their seven children were born at Graham Lodge. The Graham family remained prominent in Nowra affairs until well into the twentieth century, and many descendants still live in the district. James (Junior) died on 4 June 1927 and his second daughter Margaret Neridah [Madge] took over the property. In October 1928 Graham farm was sold to John Thomas [Jack] Bourne, a cousin of Madge's. Jack Bourne and his wife Maud took over the property in 1930 and moved into Graham Lodge with their five children. The property stayed in Bourne family ownership until 1960 when it was sold to a consortium of Greek business people led by Theo and Andrew Mavramattes, Helen Kastrios and George Simos, which subdivided the property. The Graham Lodge portion was sold to Ted Ashcrost who lived there for several years before selling to Mrs Mary Theresa Sherlock. Tess Sherlock turned the downstairs section of Graham Lodge into a function centre named Prague Lodge while she resided in the upstairs section of the home. After its formation in 1968 the Nowra-Bomaderry Leagues Club began negotiating to take over Prague Lodge. The club leased and then in 1970 purchased the property, further extending the building and making radical alterations to its interior fabric. The Nowra-Bomaderry Leagues Club survived for twenty years before financial difficulties caused its closure in 1992. After a long period of disuse during which the building became derelict, the Shoalhaven City Council purchased the property in 1998 and began restoration and interpretation works. A 2017 proposal by developers Asset Group Solutions would completely refurbish the building in a $500,000 upgrade associated with the Nowra Gateway multi-storey apartment development, after which time it would be returned to council.  Description  Graham Lodge is located near the south bank of the Shoalhaven River just to the north-east of Nowra's town centre, and adjacent to the Princes Highway by-pass. Facing east, the house overlooks some of its original pastoral landscape, including its family cemetery. A tourist information facility, the Nowra Visitors' Centre, operated for several years in a wing of the building that used to be part of Graham Lodge in its former life as a Leagues Club, and is now separated from Graham Lodge by several metres of grass. A medium density housing development is nearby to the south. Graham Lodge is a large two-storey residence built in 1860-1861 in the Victorian Georgian style with Victorian Regency influences. Victorian Georgian styling is apparent in the symmetrical ordering and harmonic proportions of windows and doors in the main facades to the east and west, the medium pitch of the main roof and the use of larger paned glass windows and durable slate for the main roof than was typically available for the earlier Colonial Georgian styles housing. It is also apparent in the boxed eaves, the use of corrugated iron (painted in stripes) for the separate upper verandah roofs and the fan-light over the front door. Victorian Regency detailing is apparent in the smooth-textured rendered and painted exterior walls, the moulded chimney tops and decorative wrought-iron balustrade on the upper front verandah.Apperley et al, 1989, 40-49 Construction is of locally fired bricks on sandstone footings, rendered to resemble ashlar, with a double hipped slate roof and four pairs of hexagonal chimneys on squared bases. Both front and back elevations have a two-storey verandah. The front upper verandah has a bell-cast roof and cast iron columns with drip moulds, iron lace brackets and fringe and a wrought iron balustrade. The front lower storey verandah has remnants of original detail, including cast iron verandah posts and iron lace brackets. All external doors and windows were originally fabricated in cedar with window sills and lintels of stone. Remnant joinery on the upper storey includes central double hung window with twelve panes, and glass and timber French doors with multiple panes and margin glazing opening onto the balcony; and on the ground floor, double hung sash windows. The ground floor front door joinery (but not the door), including a semi circular fanlight, is also intact. The rendered arch was inscribed with the words \\"Graham Lodge\\", and these words have been recently been restored. An incised brick bearing the name \\"ARDENER\\" (probably referring to the maiden name of the first owner's wife) was found on the north façade and has been conserved under glass as a feature within the rest of the wall which has been re-rendered. Sandstone flagging near the western façade may have been built at the same time as the residence and there may be some remnants of a well here. Archaeological relics including broken glass, crockery, nails and bricks were present adjacent to the southern and eastern facades in 1999. Some Aboriginal relics were also discovered in the archaeological survey of 2000. The remnant garden features Howea sp. (probably more than 50 years old), and Acacia sp. The Graham family cemetery is a small private cemetery within view to the east of the residence, now on a separate allotment, that contains three headstones and the Graham monument. Its first burial was that of William Graham who died on 20 September 1852. Other known burials within the cemetery include Margaret Graham (d. 20 December 1853); John Graham (d. 24 April 1862), James Graham (d. 24 July 1867); Heroine Ivy Graham (d. 2 February 1893); Ross Stuart Graham (d. 7 February 1906); Hubert Lionel Graham (d. 14 September 1919); Emily Anne Graham (d. 13 November 1924); and James Graham (d. 4 June 1927). There is also a memorial to Douglas Erle Graham (killed in action 14 April 1918). The headstone dedicated to William Graham is of particular significance as marking the grave of an original land grantee situated on the original grant. There is effective external interpretation on-site in the form of captioned glass panels bearing various historic images of the house and its occupants, erected at several points around the property and near the cemetery. = Condition = An archaeological survey of the precinct was carried out in 1999, which found artefacts relating to early European occupation of Greenhills were present, including Aboriginal relics both pre-conact and post-contact. A further archaeological survey was carried out early in 2000 and artefactual material was also exposed during the demolition of the Nowra Bomaderry Leagues Club buildings. Strong potential archaeological sites beyond the existing property boundary have also been identified. Graham Lodge retains much of its external fabric, joinery and detailing intact. Unsympathetic additions have been largely dismantled. Much of the interior fabric of the building has been compromised or removed during modifications and is presently being reconstructed. Its relationship to the pastoral landscape has been somewhat compromised by the construction of a large tourist information facility very close by. = Modifications and dates = * Graham family era (1860-1928) - the back of the residence was accompanied by a variety of working sheds and cottages, now demolished (see Samual Elyard painting, 1877). * Bourne family era ( 1930 to 1960) - little modification * Prague Lodge era (1960-1970) - considerable modification including extension to the north at ground floor level and demolition of some of the original interior fabric. * Nowra- Bomaderry Leagues Club era (1970-1990) - considerable modification including further extensions at ground floor level and demolition of much of the original interior fabric. * Shoalhaven City Council era (1990 to present) - recent conservation works to the building have included the partial demolition of additions, reconstruction of parts of the exterior fabric and conservation works to the building generally (detailed in Shoalhave City Council's report, \\"Graham Lodge Exterior Restoration\\", 2001). The original roof with slate tiles, cedar battens, guttering and eaves was removed prior to the archaeological survey of 1999. * 2000 - Visitor Information Centre  Heritage listing  Graham Lodge is significant for its aesthetic quality as a substantial nineteenth century Victorian Georgian residence still overlooking much of its original pastoral landholdings and for its potential to expand historical understanding of early European settlement patterns and interactions with Aboriginal people. It also has significance for its historical associations with the foundation of local politics in the Shoalhaven and its more recent recreational role as club premises, in which function it contributed to the social life of the region for nearly 40 years. It can thus be seen to be a microcosm demonstrating some of the broad patterns of historical development of the region. The site has significance particularly for the archaeological potential associated with the \\"Greenhills\\" estate, including remnants from the demolished cottages and sheds recorded in historic paintings, evidence of both pre- and post-contact Aboriginal artefacts, and evidence of early Chinese market gardens. The curtilage includes a small lot within view of the house containing the family cemetery. The headstone dedicated to William Graham is of particular significance as marking the grave of an original land grantee situated on the original grant. Graham Lodge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Graham Lodge is of State historical significance as a substantial nineteenth century Victorian Georgian residence that was the focus of the \\"Greenhills\\" estate, an early European settlement in the region. Still overlooking some of the original pastoral acreage of Graham's father's pioneering property of Greenhills, the Victorian Georgian styled house has important archaeological potential for its record of nineteenth century pastoralism, its history of contact between European and Aboriginal people, and its evidence of nineteenth century Chinese market gardens . It also has historical associations with the foundation of local politics in the Shoalhaven in 1860 and for its more recent recreational function as club premises. It thus can be seen to be a microcosm reflecting some of the broad patterns of historical development of the region. Many aspects of these historical roles are furthermore evidenced in artworks and images depicting the property and its inhabitants at various times. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Graham Lodge has local significance for its historical association with the Graham family, who were among the first European settlers in the area and prominent in early local politics. It is also significant for its evidence of the craftsmanship of early Nowra builders Charles Moore and Willet Burrey. The private cemetery records the deaths of many early Graham family members. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Graham Lodge is of State significance as an early substantial residence built 1860-1861 on the NSW south coast, in the style of Victorian Georgian with Victorian Regency influences. The two storey veranda facade would appear to be the earliest example of this residential form in the Shoalhaven. The imposing facade and use of building materials such as roof slates and internal cedar joinery are an expression of the aspiration to quality and permanency in all parts of the building, illustrating both its owner's social standing and the gradual urbanisation of the area. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As the focal point of the \\"Greenhills\\" pastoral estate from 1860, Graham Lodge has State social and cultural significance because of its associations with the early European settlement of regional NSW and as an early point of contact between European and Aboriginal people, as well as a site used by Chinese market gardeners. The location of the private family cemetery within view of the home is suggestive of a more domestic relationship of family life with the deaths of family members than is typically practiced now. As the home of the municipality's first mayor and home to subsequent family members prominent in Nowra affairs, it also has local significance for local social and political history. In addition, the building functioned prominently in the social life of the region as a function centre and club building between 1960 and 1998. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Graham Lodge is of State significance for its archaeological potential to demonstrate aspects of the history of a pastoral estate with clear connections with Aboriginal people. Its archaeological potential is enhanced by the visual evidence of cottages and sheds recorded in various historical artworks including Samuel Elyard's painting of 1877, and by the proximity of the Graham family cemetery. Graham Lodge is also of local significance as an early residence which contributes to the understanding of mid-nineteenth century regional construction techniques and for illustrating the story of European settlement and local government in the Shoalhaven district. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Graham Lodge is of local significance for its rarity as a surviving remnant of a nineteenth century pastoral estate that includes a substantial mid-nineteenth residential building, a family cemetery, and archaeological sites within a partially intact cultural landscape. The location of the private family cemetery within view of the home is suggestive of a more domestic relationship of family life with the deaths of family members than is typically practiced now. The headstone dedicated to William Graham is of particular significance as marking the grave of an original land grantee on part of the original grant. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Graham Lodge is of State significance for being representative of the early European settlement and political development enacted by pioneering families in rural NSW. It is a fine example of a substantial Victorian Georgian residence using good quality materials and projecting an imposing facade. The physical relationship of the residence to the family cemetery is representative of a different, nineteenth century understanding of the relationship of family life with death. The property is held in high esteem locally as an important remnant of the early European history of the region.

It was designed by United Aborigines Mission and built from 1908. It was also known as Bomaderry Children's Home; Bomaderry Babies Home; and United Aborigines Mission Home. The property is owned by Nowra Local Aboriginal Land Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 February 2012.  History  =Background= Historically Aboriginal children were separated from their families from the earliest days of the colony. Governor Macquarie established the first Native Institution in Parramatta as early as 1814 and in 1823 another Native Institution was started in Blacktown. Both these institutions were considered failures, one reason being that once parents realised their children wouldn't be allowed to come home, they wouldn't give them up to the institutions. The Government of New South Wales also subsidised missionary activity among the Aboriginal people, including that of the London Missionary Society in the 1820s and 1830s. On the frontier of Wellington Valley the Reverend Watson gained a reputation for stealing Aboriginal children and as a consequence the Wiradjuri hid their children from the white men. With the spread of settlers and their livestock came conflict and dispossession. The first bill for the Protection of Aborigines was drafted in 1838 after the Myall Creek massacre. Thus began a systemic government approach to the regulation and control of the lives of Aboriginal people that got tighter and tighter until the 1967 referendum finally brought significant change. Until 1881 Aboriginal people were under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Secretary, Police and the Lands Department. In 1880 a private body known as the New South Wales Aborigines Protection Association was formed, and following agitation by this body, the Government appointed a Protector of Aborigines, Mr. George Thornton MLC (State Records). The Board for the Protection of Aborigines was subsequently created in 1883. \\"The objectives of the Board were to provide asylum for the aged and sick, who are dependent on others for help and support; but also, and of at least equal importance to train and teach the young, to fit them to take their places amongst the rest of the community.\\"(State Records) This objective became the basis of future child removal policy: that the supposed inferiority of the Aboriginal people would only be dealt with by removing the children and educating them in white ways. In Darlington Point Reverend Gribble established Warangesda Aboriginal Mission in 1880 and established a separate girls' dormitory. The dormitory followed the institutional model of its time, and taught housekeeping skills to the girls to prepare them for respectable employment in menial duties on nearby stations. It also housed them separately in a building which included a dining room and kitchen as well as the dormitory room. Girls were brought in from many places and kept under supervision of dormitory matrons as well as Mrs. Gribble or the wives of later managers. This became a model for the later Government run Aboriginal Children's Training Homes, the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls at Cootamundra and the Kinchela Aboriginal Boys' Training Home at Kinchela. Frustrated by the lack of legislative power to control the education and lives of Aboriginal children the Aboriginal Protection Board successfully lobbied for a new act which was introduced in 1909 (Aborigines Protection Act 1909). The Board's Annual Reports of 1909 and 1911 show the emphasis on training of Aboriginal children. The Board felt limited by the Act because it only gave them direct control over children over 14 who could be apprenticed. To remove younger children they had to apply to the magistrate under the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act 1905. The Board was of the opinion that the children would only become good and proper members of \\"industrial society\\" if they were completely removed and not allowed to return.(Brindley 48; A Board Official quoted by P Read and C Edwards) The underlying assumption was that Aboriginal people lacked the intellect to undertake anything but menial tasks. This later translated into the limits on the types of training provided; girls training for domestic service and the boys for labouring. The Aborigines Protection Act was amended in 1915 and again in 1918 giving the Board the right \\"to assume full control and custody of the child of any aborigine, if after due inquiry it is satisfied that such a course is in the interest of the moral or physical welfare of such child. The Board may remove such child to such control and care as it thinks best.\\" (Aborigines Protection Amending Act, 1915, 4. 13A.) A court hearing was no longer necessary. If the parents wanted to appeal it was up to them to go to the court. The depression and drought years of the 1920s and 1930s were particularly difficult for Aboriginal people. Conditions in the reserves remaining from the soldier settlement land redistribution, were poor, often overcrowded, and it was easy for the government to prove neglect and remove Aboriginal children. In 1937, in response to public pressure from academic and missionary groups sympathetic to Aboriginal people, a meeting was convened of State and Commonwealth Aboriginal authorities. The result was an official assimilation policy formed on the premise that \\"full-blood\\" Aborigines would be soon extinct and the \\"half-caste\\" should be absorbed into society. Meanwhile, the Aboriginal people were organising to become a force of resistance. The Sesquicentenary was marked by a National Day of Mourning and a call for the abolition of the Protection Board. The Aborigines Protection Board was finally abolished and replaced by the Aborigines Welfare Board in 1940. Aboriginal children were then subject to the Child Welfare Act 1939 which required a magistrate's hearing and the child had to be proven neglected or uncontrollable. Aboriginal children continued to be sent to Cootamundra, Bomaderry and Kinchela, some went to Mittagong or Boystown. There were no specific homes for uncontrollable Aboriginal children so these were sent to State corrective institutions such as Mt Penang or Parramatta Girls. The education of Aboriginal children had generally been one of segregation until, in 1940, the Department of Education officially took on the role. In the 1960s the work of British psychiatrist John Bowlby on \\"attachment theory\\", began to influence the institutional care of children in Australia. That an infant needs to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for social and emotional development to occur normally: rather than only being treated with affection as a reward (Cupboard Love) which was the prevailing theory of the 1940s. Fostering then became the preferred option and a more common occurrence. In accordance with the assimilation policy which was still prevalent, Aboriginal children were fostered with non-Aboriginal parents. In the case of Bomaderry the property was redesigned. In May 1967 a referendum changed the Australian constitution bringing positive changes for the Aboriginal people. One resultant change was the abolition of the Aborigines Welfare Board in 1969. =Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home History= In June 1884 the Native Christian Endeavour Society was formed in La Perouse. In 1899 it became known as the New South Wales Aboriginal Mission then in 1907 it became the Australian Aboriginal Mission. Finally the organisation became known as the United Aborigines Mission (UAM), an organisation whose central task was to teach the Gospel to Australian Aboriginal people. UAM established children's homes, schools, hospitals, and community stores around Australia, as well as undertaking transport and language work. In 1907 a baby girl came into the care of two missionaries and in 1908 an Aboriginal woman died leaving behind 6 orphaned children; together these 7 children became the first residents of the Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home established by UAM in 1908.(Goodfellow) The Home opened in 1908 in a three bedroom cottage on 3 1/4 acres of land next to the Shoalhaven River. It is often referred to as the \\"first children's home\\" as it predates the others established under the 1909 Act and was established as a home for orphaned and neglected children. As more children arrived, the cottage was enlarged and another cottage was built on an adjoining block of land. By 1913 there were 17 children from 3 1/2 years to 12 years. A newspaper report of the time stated that \\"quite a number (of children) have been drafted out to comfortable houses\\".SMH 20Sept 1913 The cottages were located in bushland and there was a walking track to the river. In 1914 a building was moved from Roseby Park to the Home to become the boys' dormitory. By 1916 there were three cottages and twenty nine children in the home, with ages ranging from two to sixteen years.SMH 1916 A third parcel of land was donated to the home by Mark Morton. Likewise furniture, clothing and food came from donations from the community. Under the 1909 Aborigines Protection Act children were removed from their families if they were found to be neglected. The Act was originally intended to enable the training of Aboriginal children and was therefore aimed at older children. The Act was amended in 1915 to allow younger children to be taken and to give the Board more power to act without parental consent.(P. Read) An article in the Sydney Morning Herald in 1921 reported in the words of an official from the Aborigines Protection Board \\"that the principal work of the Board was the rescuing from the Reserves of all children who had reached the age of 14 years, and the taking of children from parents whose neglect warranted the board's intervention.\\"SMH 28 Dec 1921 Children removed by the Board who were old enough for training were taken to the Board's own institutions such as Cootamundra Girl's Training Home or Kinchela Boy's Training Home. If the children were taken very young, or as babies, they were first taken to Bomaderry Children's Home. UAM supported the activities of the Aborigines Protection Board by providing a home for these young Aboriginal children. In 1922 there were 45 children at the home with the two eldest being apprenticed by the mission. On the site were three buildings with a fourth under construction.SMH 17 April 1922 The number of the children at the home must have fluctuated around the upper 30s as in 1924 there were 36 children. The children at the Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home were housed in dormitory cottages up until the 1960s. There was a separate cottage for kitchen and dining and for the sisters' accommodation. By 1964 the dormitory cottages were in poor condition and had to be removed. On the weekend of 14 July 1964 volunteers commenced building the first of five new cottages to replace the dormitories. Many local businesses donated or subsidised the cost of materials; much of the furniture was donated by a company in Sydney (Hipkin). In direct response to the \\"attachment theory\\" of childcare, which was prevalent at the time when new buildings were needed, the design of the new dwellings at the Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home became focused on a single \\"family\\" unit. Each cottage would have a parent figure or parent couple who would be in charge of a group of up to 9 children, some of whom were siblings. Each cottage had four bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchen, laundry and lounge and were self-sufficient in terms of cooking and cleaning. Today the Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home has enormous significance for the people sent there as children. It is a place associated with deep emotional ties, there are feelings of both hurt and affection for the place. People associated with the Bomaderry Aboriginal Children's Home include Harry Penrith (Burnum Burnum), of Woiworung and Yorta Yorta heritage, who was born at Wallaga Lake on the south coast of New South Wales. He was taken from his family and placed in the United Aboriginals Mission Home at Bomaderry and later transferred to the Kinchela Boys Training Home.(National Museum of Australia)  Description  The property is a corner block comprising three lots. It slopes gently towards Brinawarr Street with a frontage of 183 metres to Brinawarr Street and 159 metres to Beinda Street. The existing vehicular access to the site is from Beinda Street however the original entrance was from the other frontage. The original fence is still partially evident along Brinawarr Street. The site has areas of exposed rock and some large trees. Two large gums survive in the centre of the site which can be seen in the earlier photos of the site. Dense vegetation still exists along the northern boundary. In an open area between the surviving houses and Brinawarr Street the remains of the original cottage dormitories can be seen in pathways and remains of footings. These cottages had termite infestation and were demolished and burnt over a period from 1964 to 1972. There are five existing houses on the property dating from the 2nd phase of the United Aborigines Mission occupancy period from 1964 to 1988. These are constructed of fibro/ asbestos sheet with aluminium framed windows and corrugated metal roofs. One house is currently used as an office by the Nowra Local Aboriginal Land Council, and an original cottage from the 1st phase (1908 to 1964) that was moved on the site to its present location during the 2nd UAM phase. It has some features including many original windows and doors but has been opened up internally for office use. Two smaller weatherboard buildings were originally used as wood sheds are located between the houses. There are two large and one smaller colorbond sheds which have been erected since 1996 at the northern end of the site. = Condition = The dormitory buildings from the 1908-1964 period have been demolished, but the interconnecting paths and some footings are still evident. The area should be treated as an archaeological zone. The five surviving 1964 -1973 \\"contemporary cottages\\" were reported to be in good condition as at 25 March 2011. The interior of the matrons cottage appears to be highly intact and includes evidence of the use by children, such as labelling shelves in a wardrobe. The interior of the Land Council house has been modified and the interiors of the other three were not inspected. The post 1960 buildings are very intact. The pre 1960 buildings have been demolished but their footings can be seen in the grass. = Modifications and dates = * 1964 - 1972 Demolition of original dormitory cottages and construction of five new houses. * 1964 - the house \\"Ebenezer\\" was constructed. * 1968 - the house \\"Maranatha\\" was constructed. * 1970 - the house \\"Bethel\\" was constructed and it was occupied by the Matron Kennedy and children. * 1972 - the house \\"Bethesda\\" was constructed and it was occupied by a couple and their own son, and three teenage boys. * 1973 - the house \\"Salem\\" which was the converted Sisters cottage was occupied by a couple and their daughter and children of the home. * 1988 - the children's home closed.

Funded through Kickstarter in 2016, players take control of a wizard as they traverse a procedurally generated dungeon, using a wide variety of spells to defeat mobs, three major bosses, and a final boss to earn the title \\"Wizard of Legend\\". The game received generally favourable reviews.  Gameplay  Wizard of Legend is a top-down 2D roguelike game where the player controls a wizard as they attempt to complete a 10-floor procedurally generated dungeon, the 'Chaos Trials', using a selection of various spells to defeat various enemies and bosses and become the titular \\"Wizard of Legend\\". Each button or key casts a spell, called 'arcana', in the form of a basic attack, an evade, a 'signature' (more powerful) arcana, and then a variety of alternate spells to defeat enemies, bosses and transversing the dungeon. New spells can be bought in the dungeon with collected money, or added permanently to equip before entering the dungeon through 'Chaos Gems', a persistent currency. Passive upgrades, called Relics, are collected in the same way. The game is completed after defeating three major bosses (wizards representing fire, earth, water, air, and lightning), and a final boss representing all the normal elements as well as a special element known as chaos.  Chaos Trials  The Chaos Trials are a structurally randomized series of rooms that increase in difficulty with time. The Chaos Trials are separated into four sections. The first three sections are each themed with one of the five basic arcana mentioned above. Each section consists of three floors - two regular dungeon floors and a boss floor. Each boss has a different skill set based on their arcana. Additionally, each changes the amount of attacks they perform based on how many floors have been beaten. After the first three sections are completed, the final boss is found as the last trial. He wields the chaos element, a powerful arcana which is gradually unlocked for the player as a result of repeatedly defeating the final boss.  Development  The game was subject to a Kickstarter in June 2016, raising $72,681 from the $50,000 goal. Wizard of Legend was released simultaneously on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One on May 15, 2018. =Music= The soundtrack, composed by Dale North, was first released by Scarlet Moon Records on May 15, 2018,http://www.dalenorthmusic.com/blog/2018/5/22/wizard-of-legend- composer-commentary-and-soundtrack-liner-notes with a complete soundtrack recording on digital and CD mediums release on January 17, 2020.http://www.dalenorthmusic.com/blog/2020/6/12/wizard-of-legend-goes- physical-and-so-does-my-soundtrack.

Kevin McClusky of Destructoid awarded it 6/10, saying \\"Spell effects are beautifully animated, and combat feels fluid and entertaining.\\" but criticised frame skips on the Nintendo Switch edition of the game. Dominic Tarason of Rock, Paper, Shotgun said \\"Wizard of Legend is a good, if lopsided game. The moment-to-moment combat is highly flexible and seldom anything less than satisfying, especially in co-op.\\", but criticised the repetition of the dungeon, saying \\"If you can overlook the repetition in targets and mix up your own playstyle, this one’s an easy recommendation, but for players who stick with the tried-and-tested, Wizard of Legend can slip into monotony.\\" Bradley Ellis of Easy Allies awarded the game a 7/10, saying \\"Wizard of Legend nails the feeling of being a grand wizard. Experimenting with all the different spells is a blast, and there are some heart-pounding boss fights. The peripheral elements fail to deepen or expand Wizard of Legend, but the core gameplay makes for a good time if you’re looking to fill a roguelike fix.\\" The game recorded 300,000 sales by the end of May 2018, having been on sale for 16 days. By the end of July 2018, the game had sold over 500,000 copies.

She helped to develop the practice of neurosurgery in children.  Early life  Venes was born on June 27, 1935. She was raised in a blue-collar neighborhood in Queens, New York. She was a first-generation American and the first person in her neighborhood to go to college.  Education  Venes finished a degree in nursing in 1956. Two years later she began studying the courses that would enable her to enter medical school. In 1966, she graduated magna cum laude from the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center. Next she did a surgical internship at Yale-New Haven Hospital. That was followed by a yearlong residency at Long Island Jewish Hospital. The next year was spent as a fellow in a neurosurgical laboratory at Yale University.  Career  Venes joined the neurosurgery faculty at Yale, where she remained until 1978, when she left to join a private practice in Dallas. She was a van Wagenen fellow in 1973, spending her time at medical centers in order to understand the management of intracranial pressure and the techniques of intracranial pressure monitoring. The experience influenced much of her early clinical research. While in private practice, she kept up her interest in the development of pediatric neurosurgery as a subspecialty. She was a charter member secretary of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery (ASPEN). In 1981, she became chairman of the pediatric section of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. She was also chairman of the subcommittee on Optimal Management of Congenital Lesions. In 1983, she was chairman of the ad hoc Committee on Special Certification for Pediatric Neurosurgery (ASPEN). Having been awarded a Pew Doctoral fellowship, Venes soon became a candidate for a Dr.P.H. in Health Policy. During this time she cut back on her private practice work. In 1990, she was named professor of neurosurgery at the University of Michigan. That same year Venes became a Robert Wood Johnson Fellow in Health Policy. She finished the fellowship working on guidelines development at the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. At Yale, Venes was the first female neurosurgery resident. In 1974, Venes became the third woman diplomate of the American Board of Neurological Surgeons. Long a role model for women doctors, she was a founding member of the American Society of Pediatric Neurosurgeons. Venes’ research dealt with laboratory and clinical work on shunt infection, intracranial pressure and monitoring, Reyes’ syndrome, tethered cord, craniofacial anomalies, and Chiari malformations. She wrote numerous articles and book chapters and gave many conference presentations on these topics.

The ethos the society is to promote harmony between orthopaedic and plastic surgeons, which derives from its origins immediately after the Second World War during which new methods of treatment of wounded airmen were developed by surgeons such as Patrick Clarkson. History The society was formed as the Second Hand Club in 1956 at the instigation of Graham Stack after the original Hand Club, formed by plastic surgeon Patrick Clarkson in 1952, refused to admit younger surgeons.Our History.

For example, crucifixes throughout public places like schools were to be replaced with the Fuhrer’s picture. The Crucifix Decrees throughout the years of 1935 to 1941 sparked protests against removing crucifixes from traditional places. Protests notably occurred in Oldenburg (Lower Saxony) in 1936, Frankenholz (Saarland) and Frauenberg (East Prussia) in 1937, and in Bavaria in 1941. These incidents helped to encourage Nazi party leaders to back away from crucifix removals in 1941.  Historical significance  Significance within the Crucifix Decrees lies within the single-issue based event that it was. The following list are some of the events related to the Crucifix Decrees: * From 1935-1941, there were many cars blowing horns, church bells ringing in order to produce a general sense of disruption. * Many mother's visited delegation meetings and threatened to remove their children from school. * Women were putting crucifixes around their children going into school's necks. * In 1935, a group of men pushed their way into a school to replace Hitler's picture with a crucifix. * The Bavarian Government Presidents expressed concern about the interference of Holy days and the morale of the Catholic population in August 1937. * In upper Franconia women wrote letters to their husbands on the war fronts to tell them what was going on at home in order to show how the war and home fronts were not on the same page. However, another significant note is how there were different reactions to the crucifix decrees on Nazi leaders' sides. For example, in Oldenburg during 1936 a Gauleiter speech the crowd expected him to rescind the crucifix decrees, but he began his speech on racial problems in Africa. Another example occurred in the district of Ebergs where not a single crucifix was removed from the start. These examples show how single issues ranged among Nazi officials' levels of strictness. One German term \\"Handlungsspielraum\\" is the collective opinion being expressed in a way that the regime has to respond to. This term signifies that organized protest, like those in the Crucifix Decrees among others, forces the regime to take notice and possible action. Furthermore, these events were part of Gleichschaltung on a larger note because of the all-encompassing mentality of the regime. This was a sign that the regime was taking a step into religion, yet not completely voluntarily on the citizens' side.  A woman's role  The regime saw noteworthy public protests by primarily Catholics, like those resulting from the Crucifix Decrees, and women. Public protest in the war increased as each event was single-issue based. During wartime, with more women on the home- front there were more issues that became oppressive and therefore women found this as a \\"source of complaint\\". For example, the Rosenstrasse Protest and the Witten Women’s Protest were two reactions against specific actions: the Rosenstrasse Protest being one event and the Witten Women's Protest being a string of events.

It was built in 1860 by Swedish stonemason Sven Bengtson. It is also known as Lydham and Lydham Hill. The property is owned by Bayside Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The parcel of land on which Lydham Hall stands was originally part of 1200 acres granted to James Chandler in 1822. The estate, named Bexley after Chandler's birthplace in England, was mortgaged and eventually sold after unsuccessful attempts at farming. In 1859 wealthy master butcher, Joseph Davis bought 67 of the original 1200 acres and used the land for resting and fattening his cattle before slaughter. Around 1860 Davis engaged Swedish stonemason, Sven Bengston to construct a house on part of the estate that had sweeping views of Botany Bay. The site chosen was one of the highest points between the Cooks River and Georges River. Davis was born in the village of Brede in Sussex in 1827 and came to New South Wales in 1847 and set up business in Newtown, first as a publican and then as a butcher. On 28 October 1850 he married 17 years old Ellen Turner at Scots Church, Sydney. His butchering business flourished and Davis was buying, fattening and slaughtering his own stock. Davis was also a prominent man in the district and a generous benefactor to St George's Church, Hurstville and Christ Church, Bexley. The rural character of the area remained largely unchanged until the coming of the Illawarra railway line in 1884. The land boom which followed in the wake of the railway influenced Davis to subdivide all but 8 acres surrounding his home. The streets formed because of the subdivision were named after Davis's sons, Frederick and Herbert and his eldest grandson, Clarence. Shortly after Davis' death in 1889, Mrs Davis sold Lydham Hall to Frederick Gibbins who lived nearby at Dappeto (now known as Macquarie Lodge) and was a successful oyster merchant and trawling magnate. Gibbins leased out Lydham Hall to various well-to-do tenants from 1890 to 1907, one of which was H. E. Hoggan, Manager of the Australian Gas Light Company. In 1907 David George Stead moved into Lydham Hall after his marriage to his second wife Ada. Ada was a daughter of Frederick Gibbins, who made Lydham Hall available to the couple rent-free. David Stead was a world renowned naturalist. Born on 6 March 1877 he left school at the age of 12 and began working as an apprentice to a rubber stamp maker. His scientific career began with a zoology course at Sydney Technical College. At the age of 21 he joined the Linnean Society of New South Wales and by 1900 he had written several short articles that were published by the Society. Stead's special field was in marine life and this was recognised in when he was offered employment in 1902 as a scientific assistant under the Director of Fisheries for the Commonwealth. Stead was also an outspoken conservationist and in 1909 he cofounded the Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia. David Stead had previously been married to Ellen Butter and on 17 July 1902 had a daughter, Christina Stead. Tragically Ellen's life was cut short on 9 December 1904 when she died from a peforated appendix. Christina Stead was one of Australia's greatest and most esteemed writers. She was born on 17 July 1902 in a cottage in Kimpton Street, Rockdale (now known as Banksia). She spent ten of her most impressionable years at Lydham Hall and it is claimed that she used experiences of this time as the background for possibly her most important work, \\"The Man Who Loved Children\\". Although Christina did not begin her schooling until she was seven years old she was regarded as an excellent student during her years at Bexley Public School. After a year at Kogarah Intermediate, she transferred to St George Girls High School when it opened in 1916. A great storyteller, she would entertain her brothers and sisters with tales and poems. Many of Christina's novels were based on this period of her life. Christina also moved into Lydham Hall with her father and his second wife Ada. During their time at Lydham Hall the Stead family grew rapidly with Ada giving birth to six children. The security of life for the Stead family at Lydham Hall very much depended on the benevolence of Ada's father, Frederick Gibbins. However, in 1917 Frederick Gibbins died and the exposure to his financial indebtedness was a severe disruption to the Stead family. Following the forced sale of Lydham Hall the Stead family moved to Watsons Bay Lydham Hall was purchased by the former Rockdale Council in 1960 and is managed by the St. George Historical Society. It houses many items on loan from the National Trust of Australia (NSW). The collection includes 19th century furniture and an extensive array of willow patterned china.St.George & Sutherland Shire Leader, 9 February 2016 Storms in January 2015 led to rain damage and the closure of Lydham Hall for repair works. The house was reopened to the public in February 2016 after repairs.  Description  The design is a good example of the transition from the simple Georgian colonial style of architecture to the more ornate pattern of the mid-Victorian era. It was basically four large rooms, each 14x20' with a 10' wide centrally placed hall. A narrow staircase at the southern side of the hall reaches two upper rooms, each 18' 6\\" square lit by near dormer windows. Full length French windows face north, east and south to take advantage of the cool sea breezes whilst those facing west are conventionally smaller to keep the hot westerlies at bay. Two storeys with attic. Constructed from stone quarried locally and stands on the highest point of land between the Cooks and Georges Rivers. A 9' verandah once extended around all four sides of the house and its iron roof is unsupported except for bearers in each corner and open work cast iron columns at 10' intervals. The red and stone colour scheme is original. The hip roof of the house is covered with blue slates and there are a series of small decorated brackets beneath the narrow eaves. The two wide chimneys are of unusual design and each has a drip skirt placed above the flashing. The kitchen, stables and servants quarters were originally detached and stood to the south-east of the house. The kitchen was demolished in 1958 when the last of the land was subdivided. = Modifications and dates = * 1822: Original Bexley land grant (1200 acres) * 1859: Subdivision and acquisition of 67 acres by Davis. * 1860: Construction of Lydham (house).

Heritage listing  Lydham Hall is a free stone family home built in 1860 of materials quarried locally by Swedish stonemason, Sven Bengston for wealthy master butcher Joseph Davis. It is one of the few substantial domestic buildings erected in Sydney during the period of the gold rushes and represents an excellent example of the transition from the simple Georgian style of architecture to the more elaborate Victorian style. It stands on the highest point of land between the Cook's and Georges River where it commands extensive views over Botany Bay. The house is an outstanding instance of an early pioneer home, faithfully restored. At one time it was the residence of David Stead, internationally known fisheries expert and naturalist who gave the suburb of Banksia its name and the childhood home of the distinguished Australian authoress Christina Stead. Lydham Hall was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

His research resulted in hundreds of journal articles and over a dozen books.  Life and career  Brush was born in Bangor, Maine, USA and he studied Physics and Chemistry at Harvard University, earning a Bachelor of Science in Physics at the age of 20 in 1955. He was selected as a Rhodes Scholar and he earned his Doctor of Philosophy (D. Phil.) in theoretical physics from the University of Oxford in England in 1958. He was a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Imperial College London from 1958-1959. Brush worked as a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California in the area of statistical mechanics and plasma physics for six years, 1959-1965. In 1965 he returned to New England, as a lecturer in Physics at Harvard University. There he was involved in the development of a high school physics curriculum called Harvard Project Physics, which used stories from the history of physics to engage students. In 1968 Brush accepted a tenure track faculty appointment in history of science at the University of Maryland, College Park. He held a unique joint appointment in the History department and in the Institute for Physical Science and Technology, and he received recognition as a Distinguished Scholar-Teacher (1980-1981) and Distinguished University Professor (1995). During his time at the University of Maryland, Brush worked to eliminate discriminatory practices, recognize cultural diversity, and improve undergraduate education. Brush retired from the University of Maryland in 2007 after 39 years. At retirement he held the rank of tenured full professor, with the title Distinguished Professor of the History of Science. In his role as Distinguished Professor, Dr. Brush was selected as a guest speaker for a special Mathematics lecture held on the College Park campus on November 7, 2003 which can be viewed on YouTube. Brush was active in university service during his career at the University of Maryland, including serving as President of the campus chapter of the American Association of University Professors (1979-1980), chair of the Faculty Council (1982-1983), elected to represent the History Department of College Park campus' University Senate (1991). He also chaired the Human Relations committee of the Senate (1991-1992, 1993-1994, 2004-2005). Brush had a particular interest in the history of physics, and was the founder and former co-editor of the American Physical Society's History of Physics Newsletter. He was very active in professional organizations for physics and history of science, and served a term as President of the international History of Science Society from 1990-1991. Since 2013, Brush has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. Honors and awards In 1977 Brush became a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and in 1981 he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Brush received the 1977 Pfizer Award from the History of Science Society for best book on the history of science for his 1976 book, The Kind of Motion We Call Heat. In 2009, he received the Abraham Pais Science History Award from the American Physical Society. Brush was a commencement speaker at the 2015 University of the Sciences commencement, at which he also received an honorary degree. Research Brush has been a science historian since the early 1960s. Some of his fields of research include statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, and several areas of geophysics (the planetesimal theory of the origin of the planets, discovery of the earth’s core through seismic waves, theories of the origin of the moon, and the age of the Earth). Later he became interested in natural selection and the continuing debates between proponents of evolution and creationism, and more generally how theories become accepted by the scientific community. His work on the history of thermodynamics began with a series of essays in Annals of Science (1957/1958) on the kinetic theory of gases. In this work he brought attention to forgotten precursors of kinetic theory like John Herapath and John James Waterston, who formulated the law of equal distribution in 1845 rejected by the Royal Society. In 1964 Brush translated the lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann on Gas Theory into English, and edited several reprint volumes of classical works from statistical mechanics. His first set of two books on Kinetic Theory of Gases was published by Pergamon Press in 1966. The third volume of the series was published in 1972. This was followed by a two volume set called The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, published in 1976, and The Temperature of History, in 1978 (see Publications list). During the 1980s and 1990s, Brush’s research shifted in focus to study of theories of the origin of the solar system, the moon, and the earth. In addition to many journal articles, his work culminated in a three-volume series titled A History of Modern Planetary Physics. He also continued to write about the history of science for less specialized audiences. In 1988 Brush published The History of Modern Science. A Guide to the Second Scientific Revolution 1800–1950. A book about the history of physics for non-scientists written with former Harvard colleague Gerald Holton called Physics, the human adventure, from Copernicus to Einstein and beyond, was published in 2001. Since 2001 Dr. Brush has studied the question of why various scientific theories, such as the theory of relativity or Mendeleyev's Periodic System of Elements, prevailed. This avenue of research culminated in his 2015 book, Making 20th Century Science: How Theories Became Knowledge.  Personal life  Brush was married to the late Phyllis Brush for 55 years and has two children and two grandchildren.

Many attempts have been made to differentiate between monolithic applications and other, newer forms of monorepos. https://medium.com/@brockreece/from-monolith-to- monorepo-19d78ffe9175https://blog.nrwl.io/misconceptions-about-monorepos- monorepo-monolith-df1250d4b03chttps://medium.com/@maoberlehner/monorepos-in- the-wild-33c6eb246cb9 Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb and Twitter all employ very large monorepos with varying strategies to scale build systems and version control software with a large volume of code and daily changes.  Advantages  There are a number of potential advantages to a monorepo over individual repositories: * Ease of code reuse - Similar functionality or communication protocols can be abstracted into shared libraries and directly included by projects, without the need of a dependency package manager. * Simplified dependency management - In a multiple repository environment where multiple projects depend on a third-party dependency, that dependency might be downloaded or built multiple times. In a monorepo the build can be easily optimized, as referenced dependencies all exist in the same codebase. * Atomic commits - When projects that work together are contained in separate repositories, releases need to sync which versions of one project work with the other. And in large enough projects, managing compatible versions between dependencies can become dependency hell. In a monorepo this problem can be negated, since developers may change multiple projects atomically. * Large- scale code refactoring - Since developers have access to the entire project, refactors can ensure that every piece of the project continues to function after a refactor. * Collaboration across teams - In a monorepo that uses source dependencies (dependencies that are compiled from source), teams can improve projects being worked on by other teams. This leads to flexible code ownership.  Limitations and disadvantages  * Loss of version information - Although not required, some monorepo builds use one version number across all projects in the repository. This leads to a loss of per-project semantic versioning. * Lack of per-project access control - With split repositories, access to a repository can be granted based upon need. A monorepo allows read access to all software in the project, possibly presenting new security issues. Note that there are versioning systems in which this limitation is not an issue. For example, when Subversion is used, it's possible to download any part of the repo (even a single directory), and path-based authorization can be used to restrict access to certain parts of a repository. Likewise almost all versioning systems do not require a download of the whole repository git partial cloneSvn Book: Sparse Directories Preforce: Clone, such that a download size or disk space used is not in principle not different from multiple repos  Scalability challenges  Companies with large projects have come across hurdles with monorepos, specifically concerning build tools and version control systems. Google's monorepo, speculated to be the largest in the world, meets the classification of an ultra-large-scale system and must handle tens of thousands of contributions every day in a repository over 80 terabytes large. = Scaling version control software = Companies using or switching to existing version control software found that software could not efficiently handle the amount of data required for a large monorepo. Facebook and Microsoft chose to contribute to or fork existing version control software Mercurial and Git respectively, while Google eventually created their own version control system. For more than ten years, Google had relied on Perforce hosted on a single machine. In 2005 Google's build servers could get locked up to 10 minutes at a time. Google improved this to 30 seconds–1 minute in 2010. Due to scaling issues, Google eventually developed its own in-house distributed version control system dubbed Piper. Facebook ran into performance issues with the version control system Mercurial and made upstream contributions to the client, and in January 2014 made it faster than a competing solution in Git. In March 2014 Microsoft announced that it switched over to using Git for its monorepo. In the transition, Microsoft made substantial upstream contributions to the Git client to remove unnecessary file access and improve handling of large files with Virtual File System for Git. = Scaling build software = Few build tools work well in a monorepo, and flows where builds and continuous integration testing of the entire repository are performed upon check-in will cause performance problems. Directed graph builds systems like Buck, Bazel, Pants and Please solve this by compartmentalizing builds and tests to the active area of development. Twitter began development of Pants in 2011, as both Facebook's Buck and Google's Bazel were closed-source at the time. Twitter open-sourced Pants in 2012 under the Apache 2.0 License. Please, a Go-based build system, was developed in 2016 by Thought Machine who was also inspired by Google's Bazel and dissatisfied with Facebook's Buck. Bazel, Buck, Pants and Please all use the same Starlark (formerly Skylark) build language, a domain-specific language based on Python. Some specialized monorepo build tools, such as Lerna, solve fetching of duplicate dependencies, but lack any directed graph capabilities.

It was built from 1855 to 1856 by James Wilson. The property is owned by Bayside Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  For many years in the nineteenth century the suburb of Rockdale and the locality where Wilson's Cottage is located had other names - Frog's Hollow, Muddy Creek, or White Gum Flat. Both the current name and its historical predecessors describe aspects of the geography of the area: Rockdale, a name that was adopted officially in 1878, describes the rock outcrops around Cameron Street and below the ridge of Forest Road. Wilson's Cottage is within the catchment of Muddy Creek, which with Spring Creek drains the waters of the district into the Cooks River. The area of Wilson's Cottage was sold in a government land sale of the early 1850s, with the grantee being Alexander William Riley who purchased 60 acres in April 1853. Riley (1818-1870) was one the beneficiaries of the estate of Edward Riley, and an officer in the British army (80th Regiment of Foot) at the time of his death in 1870. Riley's historical association with the grant is marginal, for on 10 October 1853 the grant was transferred to William Manning Clarke, and on the following day Clarke conveyed the grant to John Murphy for 180 pounds.Davies, 2016, 15 The 60 acres originally granted to Riley on 25 April 1853 was acquired on 11 October 1853 by John Murphy, a draftsman and landholder (painter and glazier: Davies, 2016, 15) of Waverley, who named the whole estate KilIarney (presumably after his place of birth). The architect was probably Thomas Bird, for the house was described as having been erected under the supervision of an architect, and Bird was referred to in the sale notice as having laid out the survey of the subdivision. Murphy built Killarney House on the western portion which he sold on 20 July 1854 to Thomas Henry Hayes, a livery stablekeeper of Sydney. This portion is now west of West Botany Street. In 1855 Murphy sold the portion east of West Botany Street containing 18 acres 20 perches, to James Wilson, a farmer of Cooks River. The deed contained a covenant to keep the premises safe and undefaced which indicates there was possibly a building on the land at that time. The property then remained in the hands of the Wilson family for 103 years. It appears that the family cultivated their land but the type and extent of crops is unknown. James Wilson was formerly overseer to Colonel Johnson of \\"Annandale\\" on land previously owned by John Bowmer. The exact date of construction of the cottage is not known but it would appear to have been between and . James Wilson, a sawyer by trade, arrived in Australia on 20 May 1850 aboard the Thetis with his wife, Isabella (née Macdonald), and seven of his eight children. These were Isabella aged 19, John 17, Janet 13, Helen 12, Francis 10, James 6, and Mary Anne aged 4. His eldest son, David, had immigrated the previous year aboard the Thomas Arbuthnot with his wife, also an Isabella (née Muril), and two stepsons, Robert aged 7 and John 5. David, in 1850, worked as a storekeeper in Sydney but by 1854 he was working as a labourer at Cooks River. In 1863 James Wilson sold 9 acres 21 perches of land along the eastern side of his property to John Bowmer, a gardener who had arrived aboard the Irene on 16 October 1852.Design 5 1997 After James Wilson died on 20. April 1869, the estate passed to his wife who, on 23 April 1884 sold the house and land to their son, David George Wilson. It appears from records that David Wilson continued market gardening and lived there with his family. When David died on 31 January 1905, the property passed to his wife, Sarah Ann (née Brown), the executor being David George Wilson Jnr. David Jnr was not a gardener but a clerk living at Dulwich Hill and on 28 January 1917 Sarah Wilson leased about 3 acres with a house on what was then known as Wilson's paddock to Chinese market gardeners, Fong Hoy and Fong Loy, trading as Sam Lee for 12 shillings per week. When Sarah Wilson died on 10 February 1923, she left the property to four of her children, Lily Maud Loveday (née Wilson), Elsie Mabel Thompson (née Wilson), David George Wilson and Leslie James Wilson. On 30 November 1929, nine allotments along the northern boundary of the estate were sold at auction, while the southern portion comprising the market garden was retained by Lily Maud Loveday. The 1929 auction notice suggests Lots 1 to 9 are vacant but a Water Board survey dated September of the same year (two months before the auction) shows clearly that all lots except Lots 1 and 7 are built on. It is possible that the survey was added to at a later date, a practice common with these plans. This same survey shows no additions or outbuildings to the cottage while the subdivision plan shows an addition to the east. Site evidence suggests that, at about this time, the lath and plaster ceilings were replaced with timber boarding. From May 1930 to April 1945 the land was leased by Chinese gardeners, Kim Fun and Lee Yee, and from April 1945 to March 1952 by Fun Low, Chune Hor and Ah Look. The cottage probably provided accommodation for the Chinese workers. An early publication relates a police raid on the premises during which West Botany Street gardener Ah Quay was charged with being the keeper of a common gaming house. Also before the Court were Messrs. Ah Sing, Lee Choy, Wing Lee, Lee Sup, Ah Lee, Wong Foo, Ah Chew, Ah Chuck, Lee Fun and Go Hop. A 1951 aerial photograph shows the intensity of the market garden activity and at least two shed structures to the south with what appears to be a small service compound between them and the cottage. A large tree can be seen to the east of the cottage with a small addition joining it on this side When the Cumberland County Council imposed restrictions on the development of large tracts of land, the market gardens in West Botany Street were designated as open space. On 10 June 1952 the land passed to Lily Maud Upcroft and, when the garden lease expired in 1958, the property passed to the Council of the Municipality of Rockdale. The deed is marked \\"No further dealings to be registered.\\" It is possible that about 1958, the cottage ceased to be used as a residence. Prior to about 1972 Rockdale Council continued the historical land use of market gardening. It seems cessation of that use and conversion to recreational space was undertaken about that time, in 1971, when Rockdale Park opposite was developed from playing fields into a botanic garden. The removal of the playing fields upset local groups such as the St. George Cricket Association. and a petition of protest was generated. About this time Council was running out of places to dispose of municipal rubbish. It was raised in November 1971 by Mayor Rathbone that the market garden should be considered as a short term measure. About 1972 the weekly tenancy of the Chinese market gardeners, Fun Low, Chune Hor and Ah Look, was terminated.Davies, 2016, 39 An aerial photo of 1977 shows the site cleared of garden beds, levelled and in use for sports. The Rockdale Women's Netball Complex opened officially on 2 April 1978.Davies, 2016, 40 The cottage has been used by Rockdale City Council as storage rooms for salvaged interior fixtures and plant nursery equipment, in a public park. Wilson's Cottage has been empty for many years and is in a very poor and vulnerable condition. The future of this diminutive 19th century cottage will only be made possible if its conservation and restoration is undertaken and the building is given a viable future use.Bayside Council, grant application, 12/2016  Description  Wilson's Farmhouse sits in the north-west corner of the Women's Sports Field, approximately 10m from a dark brick 1970s two-storey house on the neighbouring site to its north. It is now located in a shallow hollow created by filling the former market garden area to create netball courts and their associated car parking area.Davies, 2016, viii The site contains few elements relating to its early development. The only remaining site element relating to the history of Wilson's Farmhouse is one Peruvian peppercorn tree (Schinus molle) to the north-west of the cottage.Davies, 2016, 65 The open space formed by the netball courts to the south of the cottage occupies most of the land retained by James Wilson after his 1863 sale to John Bowmer. It also includes the land on the other side of Muddy Creek sold to John Bowmer. A suburban housing subdivision now occupies the northern boundary along Bryant Street. The rest of Wilson's land is still open space. The farmhouse is one of the earliest surviving houses in Rockdale from a period when the place was undeveloped and the land was rural. It is associated with early market gardening in the area, has a long association with the Wilson family who farmed the land, which was originally 18 acres and 20 perches. The property is also associated with Chinese market gardeners who leased the land from 1930 to 1952. An earth berm that raises the level of the ground adjacent to the netball courts runs parallel to the cottage a couple of metres from its southern elevation. This change in ground level has covered over any physical evidence of the former compound of outbuildings to the south and left the cottage in a low-lying depression. The original relationship of the cottage to the street has also been altered by this change in level. Other earthworks in the immediate vicinity have removed or covered evidence of the rear additions to the cottage and the large tree planted at the rear. A pine tree and recent plantings of small native trees partially screen the building from West Botany Street, replacing the low hedge visible in Eardley's sketch. The only vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the cottage is closely mown grass. High-tension power lines run east–west immediately adjacent to the cottage. These lines, together with the earth berm form a subtle visual boundary between the farmhouse and its remaining original open space. Car access to the property is via the Kerb crossing used for the netball courts. This is in approximately the same position as the sole vehicular entry to the market gardens visible in the 1951 aerial photograph. The area to the south of the cottage, previously occupied by a group of outbuildings, had been filled and raised and is now used for car parking during sporting activities. ;House Wilsons Farm House is a single-storey, four-room, gable-roofed cottage. Externally, the cottage is constructed of roughly sparrow picked sandstone with dressed sandstone window sills. Two simple gable walls, with'S' wall ties, form the north and south elevations. The north wall incorporates the only chimney. The east elevation has two windows, .one each side of a centre door. Three crude sandstone steps lead down from the door. On the west elevation to West Botany Street, two windows flank an off-centre door, reflecting those on the east elevation and are protected by a hipped verandah. The timber verandah structure and vertical timber board screen are of recent construction but appear to roughly follow an earlier structure. A rendered rough stone base to the verandah, although roughly repaired, retains vestiges of an earlier render finish which was marked out to resemble stone flags. The whole roof is sheeted with corrugated galvanised iron and most of it appears to be early. Internally, the almost square plan is divided into four rooms with no internal corridor. The two northern rooms, Rooms 1 and 2, larger than the two southern rooms, each contain a fireplace and a door to the exterior. Room 2 contains evidence of a coat rack on the south wall, and the remains of early shelving either side of the fireplace. All walls are lime-plastered masonry. Most of the grooved 150 mm timber boarded ceilings have been eaten by termites. A nailing pattern in the ceiling joists suggests a previous ceiling of lathe and plaster. The four rooms have ceiling patches of various materials. The floors are concrete throughout. Portions of a timber scotia cornice survive in Room 1. There is no evidence of a skirting nor window or door architraves in any room. An early doublehung, six-pane window and its frame survive in situ in Room 1. On the floor of Room 4 lie the remains of an early window and its frame. Other window joinery is almost entirely missing. All door frames appear to be original but none of the door leaves survive. No evidence could be found of the rear additions.Design 5, 1997  Heritage listing  Wilsons Farm House is the last surviving example of the modest pioneer homes built along the banks of Muddy Creek. It demonstrates the early rural and more recent market garden development of Rockdale. It is an extant example of a simple nineteenth-century colonial farmhouse. It is associated with an early small holding settler family, the Wilsons. Wilsons Farm House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

It was established from 1892. It is also known as Occupation Road Market Gardens, Chinese Market Gardens and Rockdale Market Gardens. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The area east of Tabrett Street is believed to have been occupied by market gardeners since 1892-3, whilst other areas were still vacant. In later years, these areas were occupied by Italian and Maltese gardeners. The site has been leased by Chinese Market gardeners since its resumption for open space 1980s.  Description  The site comprises 8 hectares (20 acres) of land, bounded by the Cooks River, Occupation Road and Bestic Street, divided into four x 5 acre leasehold gardens. The site also contains seven buildings, some of which were originally dwellings, but which are now used for living, storage and packing. Lot 4: contains a simply detailed weatherboard cottage with gabled corrugated iron roof (new). To the sides and rear, the building is clad in sheet metal, with the original split timber construction visible underneath. The verandah is timber floored. Paired windows flank the central, panelled door. Windows are timber, sashed, six pane and double hung. Joinery appears original. There is a sandstock brick skillion addition and separate recent, corrugated iron shed to the rear. Between Lot 4 and 3: Contains a series of corrugated iron sheds in very poor condition. Some have almost completely collapsed. Lot 3: contains a simple weatherboard cottage, similar to that on Lot 4. The verandah ends are enclosed with sawn timber. Similar joinery and detailing to Lot 4. There is a corrugated iron and timber skillion addition to one side. Both buildings appear to date from the late 19th Century. Lot 2: contains a corrugated iron shed with gabled roof and skillion addition to the side. The age is difficult to ascertain from an initial inspection, as some of the corrugated iron has been replaced. As at 26 November 1998, the site is still under production as a market garden and has some archaeological potential related to its continuing use as a market garden. The Kyeemagh Market Gardens appear to be a largely intact site and include a number of extant structures which appear to be little altered since their erection.  Heritage listing  The Kyeemagh Market Gardens are of high significance for their association with the Chinese community and their demonstration of a continuing pattern of land use from the late nineteenth century to the present. Market gardens such as these were once typical in the Rockdale Municipality but are now becoming increasingly rare. Kyeemagh Market Gardens was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Kyeemagh Market Gardens are of historical significance for their demonstration of a continuous pattern of land use since the late nineteenth century. They are also of significance for their association with the development of local industry and for their association with early Chinese and European immigration and the influence of ethnic communities on local industry. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Kyeemagh Market Gardens have aesthetic significance as a continually used market garden area which has survived the pressure of modern urban expandion. The weatherboard cottages on Lots 3 and 4 are excellent examples of Victorian period rustic vernacular architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Kyeemagh Market Gardens are of high social significance for their association with early ethnic communities, especially the Chinese Community, and for the role they have played in helping to feed the local and regional population, particularly during the Inter-War, Depression and Post-War periods. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Kyeemagh Market Gardens have some technical/research significance for demonstrating early market gardening practices, particularly through some of the extant structures on the site relating to previous uses. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Market gardens such as this are becoming increasingly rare and the Kyeemagh Market Gardens are of particular importance for their demonstration of a continuing pattern of usage from the late nineteenth century through to the present day. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

Death on a Galician Shore was published by Agencia Literaria in 2009. In 2011 Villar's book was published in Great Britain by Abacus and translated by Sonia Soto; that year it was shortlisted for the Crime Writers' Association's International Dagger Award. Plot Police Investigator Leo Caldas of the Vigo Police Department has been called to the town of Panxon to check on a body of a sailor who has washed up on the northwest shore of Spain. Believed to be a suicide by the townspeople, Caldas is not sure. With help from forensic pathologists, murder is determined. Who and why are the questions Caldas is now concerning himself. While working on the death of the sailor, Caldas learns about a murder ten years ago that could be connected. Caldas is a character dealing with his own problems—the loss of his mother, the new life of his father, a sick uncle, and longing for a former girlfriend. \\"SPOILER\\" All comes together in the end, where Caldas solves the crimes of a mother Rebeca Neira killed by a former sailor (Marcos Valverde). Too, Marcos Valverde is the killer of the sailor that washed up on the shore of Panxon, due to fear the sailor (Justo Castello) would tell his secret. Background Domingo Villar (born in 1971) a Spanish crime writer was born in Vigo, and now lives in Madrid, Spain. This is Villar's second book featuring Inspector Leo Caldas. Characters *Inspector Leo Caldas—main character *Assistant Rafael Estevez-first from Vigo Police to arrive at site of the victim *Captain Sousa—Captain of ship that sank ten years ago *Marcos Valverde *Irene Vazquez—Neighbor to Rebeca Neira *Ernesto Hermida & Wife—Fisherman and wife (eyewitness to fisherman that is found dead) *Justo Castello—Sailor that is washed up on the shore *Rebeca Neira—Female killed ten years earlier *Diego Neira—Son of Rebeca Neira Literary significance and reception Villar's book is the second to use the character of Police Inspector Leo Caldas. In this second book, Villar tells the story of a close knit town on the northwest of Spain, where fisherman return to the water Monday-Saturday to fill their nets and sell their catches. Food is also an important feature to the story. The reader can almost taste the food as it is described by the locals; and speaking of locals, they are a peculiar lot of people that have their own way of living and speaking. The culture of the people plays an important role in the story. In Maxine Scott's review of the book she states that this is not a \\"complicated\\" book, and it was not necessary to have a multiple number of bodies to enhance the story.

Shebib's presentation of war and the social status of Canada's veterans is blunt and \\"non-romanticized\\". The film was well-received and is Shebib's most distinguished short film. It won the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Feature Length Documentary. Synopsis Combat footage and old photographs from extant BBC documentary footage from the First and Second World Wars is intercut with contemporary footage of First World War veterans recalling their experiences at Royal Canadian Legion halls, memorial day commemorations and veterans' hospitals. The war scenes include \\"some particularly brutal footage\\" of the Normandy landings, rest areas, WAACs dancing in slow motion with combat soldiers... \\"and then, the grim shaky records of the next campaigns—artillery barrage, automatic-weapons fire cutting down the distant running figures, and a final sweep of slumped corpses, obscene, rotting, flies unaffected by the presence of the camera.\\" The last corpse dissolves into a still of a laughing teenaged private and then the photograph itself dissolves into a veteran in the pub. The war footage blurs in time between 1917 and 1945, in people between German and Allied forces, and battlefieds, between Passchendaele, Tobruk, Ypres, Normandy, and St. Julien. At the ceremony, the veterans stand solemnly and remove their hats as The Last Post sounds over them and echoes through rooms of companies stricken with palsy, amputatations, resectioning, and senility. A light-show of night combat flares over the screen with searchlights, bombardment and incineration accompanied by an acid rock raga. Final scenes include a few old friends who watch a BBC documentary of their campaigns with little reaction and a compilation of 1944 liberation sequences, returning to wards of bedridden and semi-conscious veterans. An elderly little man sings \\"God Save the Queen\\" facing the viewer and then says \\"I'm tired now, put me to bed\\" as the camera zooms in for a close up of his face. Themes and interpretations Geoff Pevere remarks that the documentary was made at a time when \\"those who made war\\" were an unsympathetic subject, and is in that sense about \\"the marginalized and the misunderstood.\\" The veterans are \\"sidelined relics\\", which galvinizes Shebib's empathy for them. However, as Ian McKay and Jamie Swift note, Shebib \\"shuns all patriotic tropes\\", and presents the audience images with a sense of irony that would have done Paul Fussell proud, for example juxtaposing \\"an ironically absurd war song\\" along with Gustav Holst's The Planets orchestral suite and a \\"throbbing rock anthem\\". Good Times, Bad Times subverts past documentaries on the subject such that the ordinary becomes \\"savage, and the obvious arcane\\", as Mark McCarthy puts it in his review, and then proceeds to interpret a central scene in phenomenological terms: > The last corpse dissolves to a beautiful old still of some teen-age private, > hair awry, laughing in delight at something off-camera, and we know they are > the same person. But then the lovely photograph dissolves to a toothless > veteran in the pub, his face blank in some mindless odyssey, and we know > that he was that boy, once; and by some magic we in the audience are all > three, stinking carrion, bright youth, and haunted age. Our hearts begin to > break with memories of wars we never fought in. Production Good Times, Bad Times was made for the CBC Television documentary series The Way It Is. Its working title was The Veterans. =Filming= Shot on black and white 16 mm film and intercut with documentary footage from many films made decades earlier, Shebib's film makes use of what Mark McCarty refers to as \\"double-frame printing\\", which makes the veterans' pace in half-step appear \\"out of sync\\" with the viewer. =Sound and music= Shebib's musical selections for the film ranged from classical to contemporary rock. Mark McCarty describes John Granik's narration as \\"sometimes laconic, only reminiscent names of half-forgotten battlegrounds,\\" and at other times, \\"consciously poetic\\" in the vein of Wilfred Owen or Siegfried Sassoon. Release =Broadcast history= The documentary aired for the first time at 10 pm (EST) Sunday 4 May 1969, four days before VE Day. Good Times, Bad Times was rebroadcast on 11 November 1970 (Remembrance Day) and again in 1974 for the programme Such Is Life. On 7 November 1992 it aired as the eighth episode of The Passionate Eye, a documentary series which runs on the CBC News Network channel. =Home media and streaming= As of 2013, Good Times, Bad Times, which is Shebib's favourite of his entire repertoire, is unavailable for viewing in any format. Reception =Critical response= Contemporary Mark McCarty was unsettled at first by the documentary's formal design, but this gave way to admiration for the director's \\"craft and imagination\\", its \\"elegance in its passion.\\" > This is a young Canadian's very personal and original rendering of our > elders' blackest nightmare; the savage and insane armed slaughter of the two > great wars. In its effect, the film lies somewhere between Huston's [Edge of > Darkness] and Renais's Night and Fog, but it resembles neither in conception > or materials. Peter Harcourt came away from the film asking \\"For who, finally, won the war? Certainly not the people who fought it\\", and wrote of a difficult-to-describe feeling evoked by the closing poetic lines, images, and music, \\"creating a rich emotional effect\\", a \\"fusion of exhilaration plus a sense of loss, a movement into accusation and uselessness.\\" Shebib himself said that Good Times, Bad Times \\"turned people's heads around\\" by explaining another point of view, as had been true of a lot of his films. Retrospective The Canadian Film Encyclopedia describes the \\"moving and powerful documentary\\" as a \\"personal, passionate elegy for the past,\\" and a \\"tautly structured, elegantly crafted dirge\\" reflecting the guilt and madness of war. > It benefits from the inherent sense of irrelevance that serves as the > central mood for virtually all of Shebib's films, and has been justly > compared to such pacifist classics as Georges Franju's Hôtel des Invalides > (1952) and Alain Resnais's Night and Fog (1955). Geoff Pevere calls the documentary a \\"wrenching portrait\\" of the \\"forgotten war vets\\", the most \\"eloquent attainment\\" of the balancing act of passion and objectivity by Shebib as a non-fiction filmmaker. The film is a powerful statement against countercultural narcissism and \\"an indictment against collective memory\\". Referencing Harcourt's writing above, he argues that the sense of \\"uselessness\\" is the \\"real horror and tragedy in this film, the idea that these men, of all men, have become somehow redundant.\\" The film is on Piers Handling's list of top 100 Canadian films. =Accolades= Good Times, Bad Times is Donald Shebib's most distinguished short film, winning Canadian Film Awards for Best Feature Length Documentary and Sound Design in 1969.

History The parish of Anjos was created by Cardinal Henry of Portugal, splitting the territory from that of the large Santa Justa parish. The seat of the newly-created parish was a small chapel (ermida) under the invocation of Our Lady of Angels — this small chapel was later enlarged in the 17th century, during the reign of King Philip III of Portugal. From 1579 up to the 1820s, when it ceased due to the lack of means, the church had collegiate status; the college of canons consisted of 11 chaplains who maintained the daily office of worship. The original church was demolished in 1908 in order to make way for a major thoroughfare, Avenida D. Amélia (named after Queen Amélie of Orléans; renamed Avenida Almirante Reis shortly after the 5 October 1910 revolution, honouring one of the Republican revolutionaries). The church was rebuilt on the western side of the avenue, by architect José Luis Monteiro: Monteiro respected the proportions of the original church, but gave it a more pronounced Neoclassical façade. The 17th- and 18th-century Baroque interiors of the original church were fully preserved and transferred to the new one, and can still be observed today; some of the paintings are even older, both a panel by Mannerist painter depicting Saint Irene healing the wounds of Saint Sebastian, and a rare painting of Saint Anthony of Lisbon (in the sacristy) date back to the 16th century.

Among his publications are the Phycotheca Boreali-Americana, a multi-volume specimen collection of dried algae, and the Algae of Northwestern America, a reference work. Education Setchell was born in Norwich, Connecticut, to George Case Setchell and Mary Ann (Davis) Setchell. Setchell showed an early interest in natural history that was furthered during his years at the Norwich Free Academy. He went to Yale University as an undergraduate and to Harvard University for graduate work, where he studied with W.G. Farlow, a specialist in cryptogams. He did his thesis work on the anatomy and morphology of kelps. Career After completing his PhD in 1890, Setchell took a post at the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University as an assistant in biology. He rose to become an assistant professor of botany, continuing his research on kelps, and during the summers he oversaw marine research at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. In 1895, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, as a full professor and head of the Department of Botany. He initiated a series of UC publications on botany and built up the University Herbarium and botanical gardens. He remained there until his retirement in 1934. Setchell's research ranged from the taxonomy of algae, fungi, and some angiosperms to biogeography and ethnobotany, especially as these related to marine algae. His researches took him all around the world because of his interest in such subjects as the role of temperature in the worldwide distribution of algae and (in the 1920s) the role of kelps in reef formation. One side project grew out of his smoking habit: he became interested in the origins of the genus Nicotiana and did some research on Nicotiana hybrids. One of his early major undertakings was a series of specimen collections that became collectively known by the title of the first volume, the Phycotheca Boreali-Americana. In the early 1890s, Setchell teamed up with botanists F. S. Collins and Isaac Holden to create specimen collections of dried North American freshwater and marine algae. Each collection was mounted on pages bound together in a book form, with printed labels and an index, and issued in an edition of 80. Published in installments between 1895 and 1919, the Phycotheca Boreali-Americana ultimately totaled 46 bound fascicles (I–XLVI, numbers 1–2300) and 5 elephant folio volumes (fascicles A–E, numbers I–CXXV). The regular volumes each contained 50 numbered specimens, while the elephant folios contained 25 specimens. In collecting the thousands of specimens needed for this monumental project, the trio relied on many other plant collectors. Possibly his most important contribution to American botany was the multi-volume reference work Algae of Northwestern America, on which he collaborated with fellow UC Berkeley botanist Nathaniel Lyon Gardner. Issued by the University of California Press, the first volume came out in 1903 and the last in 1925. Following his retirement, Setchell continued to work on botanical projects until his death in 1943. A Festschrift was produced for his 70th birthday that included essays, a biographical sketch, and a complete bibliography. His manuscripts, notes, field books, and correspondence are archived at the University of California. Publications * \\"Concerning the Life-History of Saccorhiza dermatodea, (De la Pyl.) J.

Khristo Stefanov Kabakchiev () (2 January 1878 – 6 October 1940) was a Bulgarian communist politician, revolutionary and historian.  Biography  Kabakchiev, son of a teacher, was born in Galați, Romania. While studying in Bulgaria and Geneva he encountered socialist ideas, and in 1897 he joined the Bulgarian Workers' Social Democratic Party (BWSDP). When the party split in 1903, Kabachiev followed the more radical Narrow faction of Dimitar Blagoev; from 1905 he was a member of its Central Committee, and in 1908 he was made editor of its central organ as well as elected a deputy to the National Assembly. In 1919, the party was re-organized as the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) and joined the Comintern. Kabakchiev was a BCP delegate to the Second and Fourth Congress of the Comintern, held in 1920 and 1922 respectively. After the failed September Uprising of 1923, Kabakchiev was arrested and condemned to twelve and a half years' imprisonment. He was freed by an amnesty in 1926, and left for Vienna and then the Soviet Union. There, he joined the International Control Commission (ICC) of the Comintern, which he had been elected to in absentia in 1924. By 1928, however, Kabakchiev had been removed from the BCP's Central Committee, and he was not re-elected to the ICC at the Sixth Comintern Congress held in that year. Instead, he started teaching at the International Lenin School and worked at the Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute in Moscow; he also joined the All- Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Kabakchiev was briefly arrested in 1937 during the Great Purge, but was released the following year. After falling gravely ill, he died in Moscow in 1940.

Purdy was responsible with biologist and physiologist Robert Edwards and obstetrician and gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe for developing in vitro fertilisation. Louise Joy Brown, the first test-tube baby, was born on 25 July 1978, and Purdy was the first to see the embryonic cells dividing. Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the development of in vitro fertilisation; however, because the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously, neither Purdy nor Steptoe were eligible for consideration. Purdy was a co-founder of the Bourn Hall Clinic but her role there and in the development of IVF was ignored for thirty years. Education Purdy attended Cambridgeshire High School for Girls between 1956 and 1963 where she became a prefect, joined sports teams and played violin in the orchestra. She trained to be a nurse at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Career After gaining registration as a nurse, Purdy moved to Southampton General Hospital, but was unhappy there and applied for a research post locally to work on tissue rejection, before transferring to Papworth Hospital in her home county where the first open-heart surgeries (and, later, heart transplants) were pioneered in Britain. In 1968, she applied for and obtained a post with Robert Edwards at the Physiological Laboratory in Cambridge. Work with Edwards and Steptoe Steptoe became the Director of the Centre for Human Reproduction, Oldham in 1969. Using laparoscopy, he collected the ova from volunteering infertile women who saw his place as their last hope to achieve a pregnancy. Purdy began her work with the Steptoe and Edwards as a lab technician. She played a significant and increasingly vital role, to the extent that, when she took time off to care for her sick mother, work had to pause. During this time they had to endure criticism and hostility to their work. It was Purdy who first saw that a fertilised egg, which was to become Louise Brown, was dividing to make new cells. The birth of Louise Brown in 1978 changed perceptions and, to accommodate the increased demand and to train specialists, the team founded the Bourn Hall Clinic, Cambridgeshire in 1980. Purdy was a co-author on 26 papers with Steptoe and Edwards, and 370 IVF children were conceived during her career. Death and legacy Purdy died in 1985 at the age of 39 from malignant melanoma and is buried in Grantchester, Cambridgeshire. University College London's award for the MRes Reproductive Science and Women’s Health is named after her. Recognition When it was decided that a plaque should be put up to record the achievement Edwards suggested that the plaque should be phrased \\"Human in vitro fertilisation followed by the world’s first successful pregnancy was performed at this hospital by Dr. Robert Edwards, Mr. Patrick Steptoe, Miss Jean Purdy and their supporting staff in November, 1977\\". Recognition for Purdy was ignored and the Oldham NHS Trust received a letter of complaint from Edwards in 1982. Bourn Hall erected a plaque in 2013 which again ignored Purdy's contribution. In a plenary lecture in 1998, celebrating the 20th anniversary of clinical IVF, Robert Edwards gave tribute to Jean Purdy, saying: \\"There were three original pioneers in IVF and not just two\\". Professor Andrew Steptoe, son of Patrick Steptoe unveiled a plaque in 2015 that acknowledged the three people who were involved in developing IVF. In 2018, to mark the 40th anniversary of IVF, Bourn Hall unveiled a memorial to Jean Purdy, the \\"world's first IVF nurse and embryologist. Co-founder of Bourn Hall Clinic\\".

It is located on the original alignment of U.S. Route 66. With accompanying five photos from 2015.  History  In April 1923 Thomas B. Millard bought lot 12 of block 12 in Foyil, Oklahoma where he would build the Foyil Filling Station before selling the property to his brother William J. Millard and moving to Texas in October 1926. William J. Millard sold the property to George W. Vincent and his wife Violet in October 1931. Mr. and Mrs. Vincent sold the property to Joseph Floyd Shaffer in June 1937 but he had already been operating the station as early as 1932. Floyd Shaffer, who was the brother-in-law to both Tom and William Millard and the cousin of George Vincent ran the station for the next 33 years until it ceased operating in the mid 1960s. Floyd was a world war one combat veteran serving with the 90th Division Machine Gun Company, 358th U.S. Infantry. He was involved in several major battles after being sent to France and had war memorabilia prominently displayed on the walls of the station. He successfully ran the station at a time when Foyil had five other filling stations operating simultaneously. The other stations eventually closed their doors and were demolished leaving only the Foyil Filling Station standing. However, it too closed after hanging on for several years after Route 66 was relocated a short distance to the west, in 1962. The station began and ended as a Texaco Filling Station making it one of the oldest Texaco stations still standing on Route 66. Foyil native Andrew Hartley Payne ran past the Filling Station on his way to winning the Great Transcontinental Footrace of 1928. Singer/Actor Gene Autry was well acquainted with it from rooming at a boarding house across the street while working as a relief telegraph operator for the Frisco Railroad. Additionally, Ed Galloway's Totem Pole Park which has been a popular Route 66 attraction for many years is located only a few miles away on State Highway 28A.

He was chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) before becoming the first director of the China Tibetology Research Center.  Early life  Tseten was born in November, 1926 in Huangzhong County, Qinhai Province. In September 1948, Tseten graduated from Beijing Normal University with a degree in education.  Career  He was one of the few Tibetan communists, a group of scientists and teachers, who were sent to Tibet to extol the benefits of Marxism-Leninism. The group arrived Chamdo early in the winter of 1951. On 28 March 1959, he was appointed as a member of the preparatory committee for establishing the TAR. During the Cultural Revolution, he went into hiding. In 1981, he became Vice President of the People's Congress of the TAR. From March 1983 to June 1985, he was one of the secretaries of the Communist Party in Tibet. From April 1983 to 1985, he was chairman of the People's Committee of TAR. In 1986, he was removed from his post in Tibet, following a change in the Communist Party's position on Tibet after the 1987-1989 protests. He was appointed as the director of China Tibetology Research Center in Beijing, and he remained in this position until 2000. He retired in April 2004, at the age of 78. He died on 6 July 2013 in Beijing.  Views on Tibetan education  In 1991, he published his book on education in Tibet, describing Tibetan language education as a crucial issue given \\"strong differences of opinion\\". He attributed the absence of Tibetan education during the Cultural Revolution to the rapid expansion of education, the shortage of teachers and textbooks, and the influence of leftist ideology. It emphasized the importance of Tibetan in the development of education and economy. He reported that in a 1982 pilot project in three high schools in Lhasa, Gyantse, and Lhokha to compare the respective merits of Tibetan vs Chinese, classes taught in Tibetan at Gyantsé averaged twice as many exam marks as the classes taught in Chinese. The project was discontinued due to lack of books, qualified teachers and mismanagement. He recommended that Chinese not be taught in primary schools in rural areas and the use of Tibetan in education gradually be applied to middle school.  Notes  : 1.Dorje Tseten belongs to the first generation of Tibetan communist leaders since the Chinese military intervention in Tibet, a generation mainly from the eastern Tibetan regions of Kham and Amdo, where Chinese presence preexisted. This group was composed of aristocrats and other Tibetans co-opted to official positions, and Tibetans from eastern Tibet who joined the Communist Party in the early days and came to occupy important positions in the Tibet Autonomous Region (RAT). Most leaders of this group later suffered severe persecution during the Cultural Revolution.

It was published in September 2013 by William Morrow and Company. Set in Singapore, the story begins when a body washes up on Sentosa's tourist beach. The novel embodies the style of a cozy murder mystery and features Aunty Lee, the \\"Singaporean Miss Marple\\", as its primary detective. The novel highlights Peranakan culture and addresses LGBT issues. Aunty Lee's Delights received positive reviews from critics. Background =Author= The novel was written by Ovidia Yu, a Singaporean playwright and novelist. She has written several mystery books that have been published both locally and overseas. Yu has been described by theatre director K. K. Seet as \\"Singapore's first truly feminist writer and unabashed chronicler of all things female.\\" The South China Morning Post characterized her work as both controversial and successful: \\"Her refusal to shy away from controversial issues has seen Yu, 56, become one of Singapore's most acclaimed, eclectic and internationally successful modern writers.\\" William Morrow and Company purchased the publishing rights to Aunty Lee's Delights in 2013. =Aunty Lee= The protagonist of Aunty Lee's Delights is Rosie Lee. Lee, or \\"Aunty\\" as she wants to be called, is an elderly Peranakan widow and amateur detective. Instead of retiring with her dead husband's wealth, she opens Aunty Lee's Delights, a cafe and catering business that serves Peranakan dishes on the resort island of Sentosa. Aunty Lee is described as open-minded, intelligent and insatiably curious.. Her primary method of investigating is to question her guests over a specially cooked Peranakan dish or a tea brewed with medicinal herbs. According to Yu, the character of Aunty Lee is based on an amalgam of an aunt and a good friend of her mother's. Both people, she says, are \\"lovely, lively, large ladies who are great cooks and love feeding people with food and advice.\\" Plot summary The body of a woman washes up on the beach of Sentosa and Aunty Lee begins to investigate. When a guest does not show to her wine tasting and dinner party, Aunty Lee immediately suspects the missing guest to be the murdered woman. The identity of the woman is soon confirmed as an employee of Aunty Lee's stepson. Later, another body washes up on the beach of Sentosa, prompting invigorated investigation from Police Commissioner Raja and Senior Staff Sergeant Salim. With the help of Auntie Lee's keen ability to uncover evidence, they eventually find the murderer. =Themes= The story focuses more on Aunty Lee's interactions with the other characters than the actual murder investigation. Peranakan dishes are heavily featured in the novel and the reader is introduced to the importance of food in local culture. The novel also addresses the complexities that surround LGBT acceptance in Singapore.  Characters  *Rosie (Aunty Lee), an amateur sleuth *Nina Balignasy, Aunty Lee's Filipino maid *Mark Lee, Aunty Lee's stepson *Selina Lee, Aunty Lee's stepdaughter-in-law *Raja, the police commissioner *SSS Salim Mawar, Senior Staff Sergeant of the Neighborhood Police Post *Harry Sullivan, an Australian expatriate *Frank and Lucy Cunningham, an elderly Australian tourist couple *Laura Kwee, Mark and Selina's assistant *Marianne Peters, a suicidal IT Consultant, sister to Mycroft Peters and daughter to Mr. and Mrs. Peters *Carla Saito, an American visitor *Cherril Lim-Peters, a former flight attendant who is married to Mycroft Peters *Mycroft Peters, a high profile lawyer, brother to Marianne Peters and husband to Cherril Peters *Professor Reginald Peters and Anne Peters, parents of Marianne and Mycroft Peters *Joseph Cunningham and Otto, a gay couple Critical reception Publishers Weekly found the book \\"engaging\\" and compared it to Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Kirkus Reviews described Aunty Lee's Delights as \\"delightfully anachronistic\\" and complimented the \\"buoyant prose and a colorful cast, led by the lovably unstoppable sleuth herself.\\" Reviewers for the Clitheroe Advertiser and Times and the San Francisco Book Review enjoyed the book's \\"exotic\\" setting which they felt gives foreign readers the opportunity to learn about Singaporean culture. The latter gave the book four out of five stars.

She is best known for her work studying host-microbe interactions in tissues and immune regulation to microbes. Belkaid currently serves as the director of the NIAID Microbiome program.  Early life and education  Belkaid was born and raised in Algiers, Algeria. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in biochemistry from the University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene as well as a Master of Advanced Studies from University of Paris-Sud. She earned her doctorate in immunology from the Pasteur Institute in 1996, where she studied innate immune responses to Leishmania infection.  Career  = Academia = Following graduate school, she moved to the United States for a postdoctoral fellowship at NIAID's Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases. In 2002, she joined the faculty of the Division of Molecular Immunology in Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center before returning to NIAID in 2005 as a tenure-track investigator in the Laboratory of Parasitic Diseases. In 2008, she became adjunct Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. = Research = Belkaid's research focuses on untangling the mechanisms underlying host-microbe interactions in the gastrointestinal tract and on the skin, which are natural barrier sites between the host's inner workings and their external environment. This also includes the role microbiota play in promoting immunity against infection against other harmful pathogens. Her group has contributed to the scientific understanding of how the host immune system can distinguish good microbes from the bad. Belkaid's research also led to the discovery of certain skin microbes that play an important role in immune defense. They carried out this experiment using mice that had no naturally-occurring microbes in their skin or gut so they could colonize those mice with only one strain of \\"good\\" bacteria. They then infected the colonized and bacteria-free mice with a parasite and found that those without the \\"good\\" bacteria were unable to fight back against the parasite, while those with the bacteria mounted an effective immune response. Her team has also found that beneficial bacteria living on the surface of the skin can also accelerate wound healing in mice. Belkaid's group also studies what happens when there are imbalances in our microbiome. Belkaid's research has advanced scientific understanding of how shifts in microbiota can contribute to disease, particularly chronic inflammatory diseases like Crohn's disease and Psoriasis.

Ryan is most known for his continuous protests against Wisconsin Department of Administration’s rules prohibiting the use of signs in the rotunda. The rules were later revoked. He is also known for his supposed Cannabis activism. in October 2018, Ryan was arrested for attempting to buy radioactive material allegedly to be used to poison an unnamed target. He became the first person to be charged under 18 USC 2332i - Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, a charge that was dismissed February 12, 2020. He pled guilty to the unlawful attempt of purchasing radioactive material and was sentenced to time served.  Personal life  Jeremy Ryan was born in Belleville, Wisconsin. At the age of 17, he graduated from high school and moved to Madison, Wisconsin where he now lives. He is a non-practicing catholic and is self described on Facebook as a \\"recovering Catholic\\". In 2009 Ryan started Cells R Us, a wholesaling and consulting firm with operations in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates with an estimated revenue of two to five million dollars a year. He was also the owner of a window tinting shop called Tint Tek Window Tinting. Ryan was arrested several times and charged with disorderly conduct for various protests that he claims to have organized and led. In 2011, he claimed to have organized and led some of the first political mass civil disobedience protests since the Vietnam War. The protests were against Governor Scott Walker’s collective bargaining reforms legislation, as the occupation resulted in no arrests and he led the arrests following. In 2012, Ryan was charged with receiving stolen property. A stolen Capitol Police jacket was found in his apartment while he was unconscious. He admitted he possessed the jacket and wore it to parties as a joke. Six of the arrested protesters; Jeremy Ryan, Jenna Pope, Valerie Walasek, Lauri Harty, Anne Hoppe and Kathlee Hoppe filed a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Administration claiming that they were wrongfully arrested and should be paid for damages considering the “emotional distress, loss of liberty and damage to reputation” the arrest caused them. In 2015, they were collectively awarded $45,000 in damages by Dane County's Judge Frank Remington. Ryan was also charged for disorderly conduct outside of the Capitol Press room, now known as the Dick Wheeler press room.

On June 24, 2020, Ryan was arrested again and charged with making terrorist threats against Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney and his family. The offending messages were related to protests in Madison.  Education  Ryan attended the Madison Area Technical College and Herzing University, 2009.  Election  = 2012 Election = In 2012 election, Ryan ran for Wisconsin State Assembly District 76 under the “Individual Party”. = 2014 Election = Despite his several protests against both the GOP policies and elected officials of the party, he ran in the Republican primary against Paul Ryan in the Wisconsin 1st Congressional District House of Representatives election in which Paul Ryan defeated him. According to Jeremy Ryan, he chose to run against Paul Ryan because they shared the same last name. He also declared his intention in taking the party back to its roots. Before the 2014 election was conducted, State Republican party officials asked for Jeremy Ryan to be disqualified from contesting the primary. They argued that he misled prospective voters into signing his nomination papers thinking they were signing to legalize marijuana. The accountability board later approved his candidacy stating that the complaint lacked sufficient evidence to kick him off the ballot. = 2018 Election = Jeremy Ryan declared to run for 2018 Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District Republican Primary to replace Paul Ryan in the United States House of Representatives. In this race he described himself as a Progressive Republican. His largest issue was legalization of cannabis, which he can be seen smoking in his campaign videos, in some of which he also appears to be drunk. = 2020 Election = Ryan briefly attempted to run for Congress in the 1st Congressional District Republican Primary in 2020, but did not obtain the necessary signatures to make the ballot.  2018 Arrest  In October 2018, Ryan was arrested in Black Earth, Wisconsin, for allegedly attempting to possess radioactive material with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, a charge that was later dismissed.https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/courts/frequent-protester-known- as-segway-jeremy-faces-life-in- prison/article_a1bfdd33-4079-55cc-866c-461c3277847b.htmlIn email messages with a potential seller, an undercover FBI agent, Ryan described a target who was 6-foot-tall, male, and weighing 200 pounds. In the emails, he allegedly asked how long it would take the material to kill someone after ingested. “I’m looking for something that’s very rare/difficult to get a hold of. Also that doesn’t show symptoms immediately but kills them fairly soon after,” the message said. He also said he wanted the material to be “extremely difficult” to get so people would automatically suspect the government. On October 15, Ryan was given a package tracking number. FBI surveillance personnel later saw him go into an UPS store to pick up the package. At his initial appearance in federal court on October 25, U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Crocker ordered Ryan to remain in jail until the detention and probable cause hearing on October 29. On October 29, federal public defender Joseph Bugni stated that his client intended to use the substance to kill himself in case his cancer went out of remission.

In addition to the MBD domain, this protein contains a PWWP domain (Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro motif), which consists of 100-150 amino acids and is found in numerous proteins that are involved in cell division, growth and differentiation. Mutations in this gene cause an autosomal dominant type of cognitive disability. The encoded protein interacts with the polycomb repressive complex PR-DUB which catalyzes the deubiquitination of a lysine residue of histone 2A.

Designed in the Post-War International style by Buckland & Druce architects, the Civic Centre was the seat of the City of Ryde from its opening in 1964, and was extended in 1972 to include the Civic Hall as an event and function space. The Civic Centre remained the council seat until 2016, when the main building was closed due to maintenance and safety issues. Identified for redevelopment and demolition since 2011, the Civic Centre has been vacant since 2016 while its future is being determined, while the Civic Hall remains open. In 2019 Council lodged and approved a proposal to redevelop the Civic Centre site as the \\"New Heart of Ryde\\" designed by Plus Architecture, with Taylor Construction Group tendered as the builders in early 2020. History Designed in the Post-War International style by Leslie J. Buckland & Druce architects, who designed the Parramatta City Council Administration Building (1959) and Library (1964), the Civic Centre, with its curtain wall facade, was noted for its similarity to the 1962 AMP Building (by Graham Thorp of Peddle Thorp Walker) in Circular Quay. The council last met at the Council Chambers on Blaxland Road on 4 August 1964, with the mayor, C. M. Cutler, declaring that there had been “tremendous advances in the municipality”. The Civic Centre was officially opened on 15 August 1964 by the Premier of New South Wales, Jack Renshaw. Redevelopment and future Civic Centre at night, 2010. Described in The Sydney Morning Herald in 2011 as an \\"ugly, unloved building\\", the Civic Centre was identified for redevelopment since 2011. However a newly-elected council resolved in September 2012 not to proceed further. In November 2012, the council supported the rezoning of the Civic Centre site back to community space but this was overturned by the Liberal-majority council seven votes to five in mid-2015. In June 2015 council voted to spend $771,000 on an international design competition for the future of the site of the Civic Centre, with the Liberal mayor, Bill Pickering, noting that safety concerns had prompted further action, calling the building a “dinosaur” that was “falling down around [their] ears.” Ryde Council first met in new chambers across the road from the Civic Centre in Top Ryde on 27 September 2016. In August 2016, the Design Our Ryde international architectural competition for the Ryde Civic Hub Precinct was won by the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, a state-owned architectural firm in China. With the election in September 2017 of a new council with a majority opposed to the redevelopment plans, the \\"Civic Hub\\" proposal was overturned. The design competition-winning proposal was rejected in December 2017, with the new Labor Mayor, Jerome Laxale, explaining that “the winning entry from the International Design Competition has proved to be unworkable, as predicted at its inception [...] The design competition itself has wasted well over $1 million in ratepayers money and our community has rejected 500 to 600 apartments time and time again.” Laxale also commissioned council staff to prepare a report on \\"a feasible new Civic Centre which will include council chambers, administrative space, meeting rooms, a performance space and retail space\\". =The New Heart of Ryde= In mid-2019, the Ryde Council endorsed a Development Application lodged in January 2019 for a new proposal for the Civic Centre site designed by Plus Architecture entitled \\"The New Heart of Ryde\\", with the Civic Centre and Civic Hall demolished to make way for a new entirely publicly-owned complex without any residential development. 50 per cent of the space \\"will house public meeting rooms, offices, childcare facilities, commercial and retail facilities, a plaza and open space, on-site parking and Council chambers.\\" Community consultation of the project found 85% of respondents supported the project, and the $110 million project was tendered to Taylor Construction Group in January 2020, despite some opposition on the basis that the project was too expensive compared to the cost of refurbishing the existing Civic Centre and that the Civic Centre should be heritage listed.

It began during the second wave of feminism as a sub-movement of the women's liberation movement. WHM activism involves increasing women's knowledge and control of their own bodies on a variety of subjects, such as fertility control and home remedies, as well as challenging traditional doctor-patient relationships, the medicalization of childbirth, misogyny in the health care system, and ensuring drug safety. Notable organizations associated with the women's health movement include the Jane Collective, the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, the Feminist Abortion Network, the National Women's Health Network, the Black Women's Health Imperative and the Native American Women's Health Education Resource Center. Other results of WHM activism are the creation of feminist health centers, the Dalkon Shield lawsuit, the DES daughters lawsuit, and the Nelson Pill Hearings, which resulted in the inclusion of medication package inserts to insure informed consent for women taking oral contraceptive pills. Notable books and media resulting from this movement include Women and Madness by Phyllis Chesler, Our Bodies, Ourselves by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective, The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm by Anne Koedt, and La Operación. The WHM is unique from the abortion-rights movement in that the WHM has a wider scope of issues in relation to women and their health. The health clinics, groups, and activists of the WHM also advocate \\"nonprofessional caregivers, self-help, emphasis on alternative (nonprescription) remedies when possible, demystification of health information and providers, and clinic administration and control by nonprofessional women.\\"  Historical context  The women's health movement has origins in multiple movements within the United States: the popular health movement of the 1830s and 1840s, the struggle for women/midwives to practice medicine or enter medical schools in the late 1800s and early 1900s, black women's clubs that worked to improve access to healthcare, and various social movements in the 1960s. Helen Marieskind argues that like the popular health movement of the 19th century, the WHM worked to redefine health care, empower women, and support \\"preventive health concepts, self-awareness... [a] knowledge of bodily processes, and... demystify[ing] medicine.\\" Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, in their work Witches, Midwives, and Nurses (1972), also compare the two movements. The WHM shares ideology with other New Left movements. The environmental and anti- nuclear movements, like the WHM, oppose militarism, critique corporations and government agencies, express the need to protect humans and the environment from hazards, and stress the importance of Nothing About Us Without Us. Women and gender studies scholar Jennifer Nelson says that neighborhood health centers created by civil rights and other New Left activists were the \\"intellectual, political, and practical experiential precedents,\\" for feminist health centers, which were one major result of the women's health movement. The women's health movement grew directly out of the women's liberation movement during the late 1960s. = Women's liberation movement = Just as the Women's Suffrage movement grew out of the Abolition Movement, the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights. Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of second-wave feminism. Rather than simply desiring legal equality, members believed that the moral and social climate in the United States needed to change. Though most groups operated independently—there was no national umbrella organization—there were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate, participants in the movement believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society. One of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced. They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced, to be able to express their own views on solutions. Among the issues were the objectification of women, reproductive rights, opportunities for women in the workplace, redefining familial roles. A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism. They were not interested in reforming existing social structures, but instead were focused on changing the perceptions of women's place in society and the family and women's autonomy. Rejecting hierarchical structure, most groups which formed operated as collectives where all women could participate equally. Typically, groups associated with the Women's Liberation Movement held consciousness-raising (CR) meetings where women could voice their concerns and experiences, learning to politicize their issues. To members of the WLM, rejecting sexism was the most important objective in eliminating women's status as second-class citizens. By attending CR groups, women around the United States participated in \\"a process in which the sharing of personal stories led to a \\"click\\"--a sudden recognition that sexism lay at the root of their struggles.\\" This process included sharing their healthcare experiences with each other. They discussed topics such as illegal abortions, rape, negative experiences with doctors during childbirth and gynecologist visits, sexuality, birth control, and other aspects of women's health. This led them to \\"campaign to change how doctors, the government, the media, and the medical field treat...women and their bodies.\\"  Issues and ideology  WHM activism covers topics such as access to reproductive technology and birth control, sterilization abuse, advocating against unnecessary medical intervention during childbirth, increasing access to healthcare through the creation of feminist health centers and self-help clinics, teaching women about their bodies, discovering the history of women in medicine, critiquing the misogyny in the healthcare system, and creating health advocacy groups for women. Due to the political and collective nature of the WHM, Helen Marieskind calls the ideology of the movement Feminist-Socialism. They view the relationship between women and their doctors (especially male gynecologists) as similar to women's second-class status in society. WHM activists argue that the institution of medicine is \\"embedded in, and an embodiment of,\\" patriarchal society and is an institution of social control. Nearly all of the early literature from the WHM argued that medicine and doctors work to subordinate women, people of color, and the poor; doctors are too powerful; healthcare costs too much; and that conventional healthcare leaves patients with little to no dignity, right to health information, or ability to choose their treatment.  1969–1973  The women's liberation movement, and consequently the WHM, were grassroots, so there were many different groups of women organizing around women's health issues in the United States at the beginning of the second wave of feminism. Anthropologist Sandra Morgen argues that there are four founding events of the WHM: the workshop and research that lead to the writing of Our Bodies, Ourselves in Boston, the founding of the underground abortion service by the Jane Collective in Chicago, Carol Downer and Lorraine Rothman's self-help gynecology in Los Angeles, and Barbara Seaman's (New York) and Belita Cowan's (Ann Arbor) work to expose the health risks of the oral contraceptive pill and diethylstilbestrol. Ninia Baehr includes the activism of Patricia Maginnis and the Army of Three–even though their activism around abortion began in 1959–because they were the first to frame abortion around women's rights and the idea that women, not doctors or lawmakers, should be the ones to make decisions around abortion. = Society for Human Abortion and the Army of Three = Patricia Maginnis founded the Citizens Committee for Humane Abortion Laws (CCHAL) in 1962, while she attended San Jose State University. In 1963, she moved the organization to San Francisco and Rowena Gurner joined CCHAL. In 1964, Gurner and Maginnis changed the organization's name to The Society for Humane Abortion (SHA) and in 1965 it was incorporated as a non-profit organization in California. SHA advocated for \\"elective abortion,\\" that all women had the right to safe and legal abortion free of harassment, and that \\"[the] termination of pregnancy is a decision which the person or family involved should be free to make as their own religious beliefs, values, emotions, and circumstances may dictate.\\" The SHA believed in the repeal of all abortion laws, including the 1963 Humane Abortion Act, which made abortion legal in cases of rape or incest. While still heading the Society for Humane Abortion, Maginnis set-up another organization in 1966 to carry on an underground feminist health referral system. The main mission of this organization, Association to Repeal Abortion Laws (ARAL), was to connect pregnant women with abortion providers in neighboring countries. Their list of abortion specialists was well-researched and depended on members' information and the feedback of the women they referred. Together, the Army of Three (Maginnis, Gurner, and Lana Phelan) planned and executed civil disobedience actions in the late 1960s in order to overturn abortion laws in California. In 1968, after multiple bouts of handing out pamphlets with information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (which was illegal under San Francisco's Municipal Ordinance 188), Maginnis was arrested. The outcome of her case overturned this local ordinance, but the Army of Three wanted to challenge the state law. To do this, they created abortion 'classes,' which Maginnis was eventually arrest for in San Mateo county. The case wasn't settled until after Roe v. Wade liberalized abortion laws in the United States, but they did succeed in overturning California's abortion law. = DES = Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was discovered in 1938 and until 1971, it was given to pregnant women with the incorrect belief that it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In the late 1960s, a study published in JAMA endorsed the use of DES as an emergency contraceptive, saying that it have no negative side effects. Belita Cowan began researching the side effects of DES as a morning after pill at this time, because it was she had read medical literature that said DES caused clear cell carcinoma, a rare vaginal tumor, in girls and women who had been exposed to this medication in utero. She also heard from her friends that the pill caused severe nausea for a short period of time. Cowan brought together a group of female former patients at the University of Michigan’s student health center and organized Advocates for Medical Information. This group aimed to educate women in the side effects of the DES pill and to oppose the use of it at the University Hospital and other health centers in the country. In 1971, the organization received a grant from the student government to undertake a survey of women who had taken DES. Out of the sixty- nine women who responded, only a quarter of them were contacted by doctors after taking the medication. This proved that the advertisements for DES were fraudulent. After concluding her research about the side effects of DES, Cowan believed that women around the country should know about the effects of the drug. She contacted Ralph Nader and other feminists to host a press conference in Washington D.C. in December 1972. An oral contraceptive pack. = Oral contraceptives = When the birth control pill came on the market in 1960, Barbara Seaman was writing columns for women's magazines such as Brides and the Ladies' Home Journal. She launched her career as a women's health journalist and brought a new kind of health reporting to the field, writing articles that centered more on the patient and less on the medical fads of the day. Seaman was first to reveal that women lacked the information they needed to make informed decisions on child-bearing, breast-feeding, and oral contraceptives. She even went so far as to alert women to the dangers of the Pill, whose primary ingredient was estrogen (also the active ingredient in Premarin, which had contributed to the death of her aunt). Prolific output and the popularity of her published articles won Seaman membership with the prestigious Society of Magazine Writers. In 1969, Seaman completed her first book, The Doctors' Case Against the Pill, which would become the basis for the Nelson Pill Hearings on the safety of the combined oral contraceptive pill. As a result of the hearings, a health warning was added to the pill, the first informational insert for any prescription drug. Robert Finch, Secretary of HEW, praised Seaman saying, \\"The Doctors' Case Against the Pill... was a major factor in our strengthening the language in the final warning published in the Federal Register to be included in each package of the Pill.\\" = The Jane Collective = Officially known as the Abortion Counseling Service of Women's Liberation, the Jane Collective, or Jane, was an underground service in Chicago, Illinois affiliated with the Chicago Women's Liberation Union that operated from 1969 to 1973, when abortion was illegal in the United States.Jane: Documents from Chicago's Clandestine Abortion Service (1968-1973) [Pamphlet]. Baltimore, MD: Firestarter Press, 2004. Retrieved from Interference Archive Pamphlets. The collective was started by activists in the women's liberation movement in an effort to address the increasing number of unsafe abortions being performed by untrained providers. Since illegal abortions were not only dangerous but very expensive, the founding members of the collective believed that they could provide women with safer and more affordable access to abortions. The collective originated in 1969 with University of Chicago student Heather Booth, who helped her friend's sister find an abortion provider. The founders of Jane initially focused their attention on providing women access to competent physicians willing to provide abortion services. They found a physician they called \\"Mike\\" who was willing to work with them. After creating a close relationship with Mike they found out that he actually wasn't really a physician and some Jane activists have characterized him as a \\"con man.\\" However, many of the techniques he used were safe and effective. The women of Jane then decided to cut out the middleman and perform the abortions themselves. Mike taught the women how to perform dilation and curettage abortions, and from then on the women performed them themselves. During the years which Jane operated, the collective performed more than 11,000 abortions. They disbanded after Roe v. Wade made abortion legal throughout the United States in 1973. =Our Bodies, Ourselves= In 1969 at Emmanuel College in Boston, Massachusetts, at one of the first conference's for women's liberation, Nancy Miriam Hawley organized a workshop called \\"Women and Their Bodies.\\" Twelve white, middle-class women between the ages of 23 to 39 attended the workshop, which allowed the women to discuss health. The discussion created a consciousness-raising environment; the strong discussion supplied the women with the necessary tools and ideas that led to the attendees organizing as \\"the doctors group\\" to research about women and healthcare. \\"We weren't encouraged to ask questions, but to depend on the so- called experts,\\" Hawley told Women's eNews. \\"Not having a say in our own health care frustrated and angered us. We didn't have the information we needed, so we decided to find it on our own.\\" As a result of this goal, they spent the summer researching topics they were interested in and began teaching a course titled after the workshop, based on what they had learned and written about. It contained sections on abortion, pregnancy, postpartum depression, sexuality, anatomy and physiology, sexually transmitted diseases, and critiques of patriarchy, capitalism, and the healthcare system. The book also contained information intended to guide women on \\"how to maneuver the American health care system, with subsections called 'The Power and Role of Male Doctors,' 'The Profit Motive in Health Care,'\\" 'Women as Health Care Workers,' and 'Hospitals.'Schneir, Miriam. \\"Boston Women's Health Book Collective.\\" Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present. New York: Vintage, 1994. 352. Print. They put their knowledge into an accessible format that served as a model for women who wanted to learn about themselves, communicate with doctors, and challenge the medical establishment to change and improve the health of women everywhere. They used rhetoric that avoided describing the female reproductive system as passive, unproductive, helpless, or powerless, unlike any doctor or book at the time. Their writing was so sought after that they started selling their research as a 35-cent, 136-page booklet called Women and Their Bodies, published in 1970 by the New England Free Press. By 1973, 350,000 copies of the retitled Our Bodies, Ourselves had been sold without any formal advertising. As a result of their success, the women formed the non-profit Boston Women's Health Book Collective (which now goes by the name Our Bodies Ourselves) and published the first 276-page Our Bodies, Ourselves in 1973. The collective published it with the major publisher Simon & Schuster, only on the condition that they would have complete editorial control and that nonprofit health centers could purchase copies at a significant discount. It featured first-person stories from women, and tackled many topics then regarded as taboo. speculum.alt=left =Self- help gynecology= Carol Downer joined a NOW chapter in California in 1969, where she learned about abortions and in 1970, helped refer women to Harvey Karman's illegal abortion clinic. The Karman cannula was of particular interest to Downer, as it did not require cervical dilation, curettage, or powerful vacuum suction. Karman let them observe several abortions and an IUD insertion, during which Downer saw a woman's cervix for the first time and was \\"amazed\\" at how close and accessible it was. This inspired her interest in performing abortions and to take a speculum home to perform a cervical examination on herself. She and other women became interested in starting their own clinic after growing displeased with the male abortionists behavior towards women. On April 7th, 1971, a group of women (including Downer) interested in starting their own abortion clinic met at Everywoman's Bookstore in Venice, California. Downer showed them what Karman used to perform abortions, but the women were afraid, and she knew that \\"until [she] demystified this for them, they were going to keep on thinking that abortion was this thing that you mostly would die of.\\" Downer then laid down on a table in the room and performed her own cervical examination in front of all the women, who were initially surprised but then crowded around her, observing her cervix. A few women wanted to see their own cervix's as well, so they did self-exams on the table after Downer. Lorraine Rothman also attended the meeting at the bookstore and she found Karman's device promising, but unsafe. She designed a new type of manual vacuum aspiration device, which she patented as the Del-Em, and called the process menstrual extraction (ME). ME made its debut at the National Organization for Women conference in Santa Monica, California in August 1971. To Rothman and Downer's dismay, the organizers of the conference were \\"so appalled that they refused to give the women exhibit space.\\" Instead, Downer and Rothman hung flyers around the conference, announcing a demonstration in their hotel room. The attendees were given a plastic speculum to begin their education. From the extensive mailing list collected during these demonstrations, Downer and Rothman began a national tour, going to 23 cities in the United States to teach women the new technique. This effectively began the movement of women's health self-help groups/clinics.  1974–1980  = National Women's Health Network = In 1974, Belita Cowan, Barbara Seaman, Phyllis Chesler, Mary Howell, and Alice Wolfson established the National Women's Health Network. = Rose Kushner's critique of radical mastectomies = leftAfter being diagnosed with breast cancer, Rose Kushner objected to the treatment which was then standard, in which a tumor biopsy and radical mastectomy (which involves removing muscle tissue and lymph nodes along with the breast) were performed in a single surgical operation while the patient was under anesthesia. She had difficulty finding a doctor who would perform a diagnostic biopsy and allow her to decide what action to take next.Gina Kolata, Rose Kushner, 60, Leader in Breast Cancer Fight, The New York Times, January 10, 1990Barron H Lerner (2001), No shrinking violet: Rose Kushner and the rise of American breast cancer activism, The Western Journal of Medicine, 174(5): 362–365; May 2001 In order to have a less invasive procedure, she had found Dr. Thomas Dao, who was willing to do a modified radical mastectomy.Judith Rosenbaum, Rose Kushner, Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. Retrieved October 5, 2009Barron H. Lerner (2003), The breast cancer wars: hope, fear, and the pursuit of a cure in twentieth-century America, Oxford University Press US, , A drawing of a simple mastectomy, during which only breast tissue is removed.As Kushner recovered from her surgery, she started writing about her experiences with breast cancer. She traveled to Europe to learn about breast cancer treatment there, finding that the radical mastectomy was not used as widely as in the United States. Upon her return home, she published Why Me?, in 1975 under the title Breast Cancer: A Personal History and Investigative Report, which contained extensive medical information and advice for patients, including strong criticism of radical mastectomies and the practice of performing a biopsy and a mastectomy as a one-step surgical procedure. Her critique of prevalent breast cancer treatment included strong feminist themes, such \\"No man is going to make another impotent while he's asleep without his permission, but there's no hesitation if it's a woman's breast.\\" The book was strongly endorsed by Dr. Dao, but it was widely criticized by other doctors and the American Cancer Society. Kusher became a relentless critic of the treatment of breast cancer by the medical profession. She attended numerous meetings of medical professionals, interrupting presentations, questioning conclusions, and speaking against the prevalent practices of one-step breast cancer surgery and radical mastectomy. In 1975 she was \\"booed off the stage\\" at a meeting of the Society of Surgical Oncology, whose members objected to her challenges to traditional treatments. In 1975 Kushner and Dorothy Johnston, established a telephone hotline called the Breast Cancer Advisory Center, based in Kensington, Maryland, that operated until 1982, responding to calls and letters from thousands of women wanting information about breast cancer and its treatment. The center's establishment was motivated in part by Kushner's desire to promote patient self-help and mutual support, thus displacing the medical profession and the American Cancer Society from their roles as information \\"gatekeepers\\".Anne S. Kasper and Susan J. Ferguson (2001), Breast Cancer: Society Shapes an Epidemic, Palgrave Macmillan, , , page 327 In spite of her unpopularity with the mainstream medical profession, Kushner's work was well received in the public and won increasing respect in official circles. In June 1977, she was the only lay member appointed to a ten-member National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel that evaluated treatment options for primary breast cancer. In 1979, the panel issued its findings, concluding that the Halsted radical mastectomy should no longer be the standard treatment for suspected cases of breast cancer, instead recommending total simple mastectomy as the primary surgical treatment.Kushner, Rose. Papers, 1953-1990, Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, July 1999 Additionally, Kushner convinced her fellow panel members to include a statement calling for an end to the one-step surgical procedure. At the time of her death, Dr. Bruce A. Chabner of the National Cancer Institute said she was \\"probably the single most important person\\" in ending the practice of one- step surgery for breast cancer, because of her persistence and because she brought medical information to a wide public audience that otherwise might have remained unaware of the options.  Challenging sexism in medicine  = In medical schools = Two laws in the United States lifted restrictions for women in the medical field -- Title IX of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the Public Health Service Act of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender. In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field. The 1970s marked a great increase of women entering and graduating from medical school in the United States. From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, about 14,000 women graduated from medical school. From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school. This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes. One study surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career. This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s. The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.Shrier, Diane K.; Zucker, Alyssa N.; Mercurio, Andrea E.; Landry, Laura J.; Rich, Michael; Shrier, Lydia A. (2007). \\"Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters\\". Journal of Women's Health. 16 (6): 1–13. According to this study, one third of physician daughters reported experiencing a form of gender discrimination in medical school, field training, and the work environment. This study also stated that both generations equally experienced gender discrimination within their work environments. This article provided an overview on the history of gender discrimination, claiming that gender initiated the systematic exclusion of women from medical schools. This was the case until 1970, when the National Organization for Women (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. More specifically, this lawsuit was successful in forcing medical schools to comply to the civil rights legislation. This success was seen by 1975 when the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and continued to grow as the years progressed. By 2005, over 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field. Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their race and gender. = Between doctors and female patients = A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor patient relationships, changes in terminology, and theory. With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and changed. One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was gynecology. Wendy Kline discusses the blurring of the medical and sexual that occurred in the medical field in the late 40s into the 60s, particularly in gynecology. Kline says that \\"to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, they [doctors] used the pelvic exam as a form of sex instruction.\\" In Ellen Frankfort's book Vaginal Politics, Frankfort talks about the \\"shame\\" and \\"humiliation\\" felt during a pap test; \\"I was naked, he was dressed; I was lying down, he was standing up; I was quiet, he was giving orders.\\" as quoted in One medical student is quoted in Kline's book as saying, \\"Since I experienced my own exams as a humiliating procedure, I feared inflicting the same humiliation on another person.\\" In 1972 the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations. Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination. This method was quite different from the previous practice in which doctors were taught to assert their power over patients. With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.

Its name comes from the Latin word palatum (palate) which pertains to palate and its teeth which form there, plus the Latin word gobius, which means goby. The species name grandoculus (from the Latin words grand and oculus) refers to this species' very large eyes. Romero, P., 2002. An etymological dictionary of taxonomy. Madrid, unpublished. Specimens of P. grandoculus were collected as early as 1976, and originally described as the Mauve Goby, however it was not formally identified as a separate species and described until 2002.  Description  Members of this species reach 3.2 cm (1.3 in) total length, and have 27 vertebra.Palatogobius grandoculus Greenfield, 2002 FishBase. Their dorsal fins contain only 8 spines but 17–18 soft rays. Similarly, their anal fins have only one spine, but 18–19 soft rays. Overall, this species is very similar in appearance to its relative, the Mauve goby (Palatogobius paradoxus), however P. grandoculus has a much larger eye and shorter snout than P. paradoxus, as well as a much narrower band of skull between the orbits. Its body scales also extend forward on the sides, past the origin of the first dorsal fin, while other members of its genus have scales which only extend to beneath the second dorsal fin.  Distribution and habitat  P. grandoculus is found in marine waters and lives at depths between 253 and 276 meters (830 to 905 feet).Bogutskaya NG (2007).

Its literal meaning is \\"kinship\\", but it is often used to refer to Cree law, or Cree codes of conduct.  Etymology  In the Cree language, nêhiyaw wiyasowêwina literally translates to \\"Cree laws\\", but law is almost invariably referred to as wahkohtowin, which means \\"kinship\\", in reference to an individual's relationship with, and responsibilities within, the systems of which the individual is a part. As such, \\"wahkohtowin\\" is an imperfect translation of \\"law\\", because law in the pre-colonial Cree context does not refer solely to positivistic or formalistic rules. Rather, wahkohtowin is a set of obligations which flows from one's role within his or her community.  Origins  Understandings about wahkohtowin may have sacred origins, may come from positivistic rules, or may come from observations about the natural environment. Knowledge from these sources is then processed through deliberation, ceremony, and storytelling. Cree law lives on primarily through stories, which are among the most important references for Indigenous law.  Features  The most recurrent theme within wahkohtowin is the circle. Wahkohtowin connotes interconnectedness, so circles are used as symbols to represent the way in which every element of a system is part of the whole. This reaffirms unity under the Creator and within the community, and represents the continuum of life. Wahkohtowin sometimes physically takes this form; for example, a community may gather in circles for prayer, discussion, and healing. Cree law uses different circles as a visual way to conceptualize different legal principles; there are usually four elements or stages comprising a given circle. For example, the most foundational circle-metaphor describes the four kinds of human beings; when one understands one's identity in this circle, then one accepts the responsibilities which accompany that identity. Envisioned as a series of concentric circles, children (the most treasured and precious) are placed at the centre. Old ones are next; they are the keepers and teachers of knowledge and represent the past. Women, the nurturers and protectors, are third, and men, who are responsible for safety, constitute the outermost circle. Another important circle metaphor in the Cree worldview represents one's personal identity. The innermost level represents the individual, followed by the family, the community, and the nation, respectively. In the Cree worldview, identity is inseparable from land, home, community, or family; these things together constitute a healthy wahkohtowin.

It was built from 1880 to 1884 by Edward M. Farleigh. It has also been known as Cairnsfoot Special School, Loftus Street Special School and Loftus Street Public School. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The name \\"Turrella\\" is an Aboriginal word meaning \\"a reedy place\\" or \\"water weeds\\". Wolli Creek, which runs through the original site of settlement, was first known as Woolly Creek, and it is quite likely that the weeds in the water gave it a thick appearance. The land on which Cairnsfoot was later built was first granted to Ruben Hannam on 31 August 1833. = Ownership by the Farleigh family = Edward Manicome Farleigh was born in County Mayo, Ireland, in 1838, the son of a coast guard officer. In 1865, with his wife and two small sons, he migrated to the colony of Victoria. In 1873, they moved to Sydney, where Farleigh established the leather merchants' firm of E.M. Farleigh Pty. Ltd. at Mascot, which was later called Farleigh, Nettheim and Company. E. M. Farleigh had started work as a tannery worker and from there set up his own business. Early in 1884, Farleigh purchased of uneven ground in Loftus Street at the corner of Willington Street and erected a fine two storey Italianate mansion with extensive outbuildings which was called Cairnsfoot. Mrs. Farleigh is said to have been delighted with every feature of the house except the main staircase, which she considered mean and unnecessarily steep for a house of its size. By 1885, the family had increased to ten children the eldest of whom, John Gibson Farleigh, was to become a leading industrialist and a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. Cairnsfoot was set with outbuildings in a garden setting of mature trees. The grounds included four trees which survive today and are thought to date from 1884: two Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) and two evergreen magnolias/bull bays (Magnolia grandiflora) from America. Cairnsfoot shows the development of large villas on the urban fringe of Rockdale. A photograph shows that the architectural layout of the garden did not change during the seventy years the Farleigh family lived at Cairnsfoot. It shows garden beds planted with annuals. Mass planting of bedding plants delighted the Victorians. After Edward Manicom Farleigh died in 1909 the western half of the estate was sold and a new street, appropriately called Edward Street, came into being. There is no record of this part of the original estate. It may have included paddocks for horses and a house cow, a poultry run, a garden supplying vegetables and flowers to the house and perhaps a glasshouse. There were (other) dairies, poultry farms and Chinese market gardens in the Arncliffe district at this time. Two unmarried sisters, Elizabeth and May, were the last of Edward Manicom Farleigh's family to live at Cairnsfoot.  Grounds and gardens  Cairnsfoot's grounds are shown in a series of photographs taken between 1943 and 1947 by neighbour Alan Evans. These photographs show a large and sophisticated garden with pollarded camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) running along the entire length of its Loftus Street boundary, high timber picket fence and paling fences on Loftus Street, double gates for carriages and cars and a single gate for pedestrians. A large white camellia (Camellia japonica cv.) was beside the pedestrian gate. Also growing along that boundary were giant Danubian (or Spanish) reed clumps (Arundo donax and oleanders (Nerium oleander cv.s). Inside the main gates these photographs show the house dominating the view, facing east and south. The northern wall was windowless. All windows had wooden Venetian blinds. The carriage drive continued westward to the stables / coach house. The drive and carriage circle were separated by a teardrop shaped bed bordered by stones and planted with candlestick aloes (Aloe arborescens), yellow lantana (Lantana camara cv.) and the dramatic succulent, Agave attenuata. Along the southern verandah of the house were hydrangeas (Hydrangea macrophylla), an autumn camellia (Camellia sasanqua) pruned into an umbrella form, a Lord Howe Island palm (Kentia fosteriana) and a variegated Japanese laurel (Euonymus japonicus \\"Aureo-Variegatus\\" pruned into a globe. To the south of the drive was an orchard and vegetable garden. A wooden railing marked the boundary of the ornamental garden. Fruit trees included China pears and peaches. A house cow, Biddy, grazed in the orchard. Also along the southern edge of the drive are two fine specimen trees - two large Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) and two evergreen magnolias/Bull Bay trees (Magnolia grandiflora). To the north of the carriage loop was a border of wormwood, oleanders and roses edging a lawn area. Garden beds around it contained roses, conifers and occasional plantings of gladioli, zinnias, wallflowers, lupins, pansies etc. A freestanding arbor/pergola to the north-east of the house was covered in climbing roses. Along the northern house wall was a large frangipani (Plumeria rubra cv.). A border on the north side of the lawn was planted with clipped azaleas (Rhododendron indicum cv.s), a yucca (Yucca sp.) and succulents including Echeveria sp. / cv.s such as E.x \\"Imbricata\\". A high wire mesh fence ( from the photographs) ran along the back (northern side) of this shrubbery. A Port Jackson fig (Ficus rubiginosa) and other trees shaded this border. Further north again was the most spectacular planting in the garden - a large grove of century plant (Agave americana) in the north-eastern corner. Perched on a rocky plinth its sculptural form and fleshy striped yellow leaves made it a feature. In the rocky northern end of the garden was a pergola covered in bower-of-beauty vine (Bignonia sp., now called Pandorea jasminoides) leading to a wilder area of the garden. Also here was a fernery, a ubiquitous feature of Victorian gardens with a collection of ferns, palms, orchids and begonias inside. Behind that were the stables with a hayloft above. A small cockscomb coral tree (Erythrina crista-galli), more succulents, a wooden railing marking the boundary to the north of the ornamental garden were other features of this part of the site. = Ownership by the NSW Department of Education = The property remained the family home of the Farleighs until it was bought by the NSW Department of Education in 1959. Prior to the building being opened as the Loftus Street Special School the original cast iron was removed and the upstairs verandahs were enclosed. In more recent times the whole complex has been upgraded and sympathetically refurbished by the NSW Public Works Department. This has included the replacement of the cast iron work and restoration of its original name, Cairnsfoot. The house then served as the administrative block of the school with new buildings which have been added to cater for 99 handicapped children, aged from four to 18 years.Branch Manager's Report 321/87 of 27/7/1987 The Loftus Street Public School, when it incorporated with South Haven School reverted to using the original property name of Cairnsfoot (for the School). When the new section of Cairnsfoot School was designed by Sydney architect Olga Kosterin, it had as its focal point the assembly hall, which serves also as a classroom for art, music and physical education. The Library had books selected for the needs of the children. The home economics block where children were taught skills aimed at making them as independent as possible, was also important. In the laundry children washed and ironed - processing their own clothes on particular days. There was also a bathroom and a fully furnished bedroom. In the solar heated pool, swimming lessons and water therapy were year-round activities and children benefited from special exercise programs. Rockdale Municipal Council listed the building in 1985 and it is recorded by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). In January 2017, Cairnsfoot School vacated the building and undertook a $21.9 million move to new premises in Brighton-le-Sands. The ageing facilities, the inability to adapt them due to the heritage-listed house, and the school site not being flat were cited among reasons for the move. In 2018, the NSW Government proposed to rezone the site as residential for high-rise apartments; however, this proposal was scrapped in March 2018 after community opposition. The Minister for Education Rob Stokes announced that the site would be \\"needed for future educational purposes\\".  Description  Cairnsfoot is a two-storey rendered brick Victorian Italianate villa with gabled roof covered in slate tiles with verandah and balcony at front, with cast iron balustrades, posts, brackets and valences. A shallow bay window dominates the front with two rendered brick chimneys. An original timber back verandah with a shillion roof sits at the rear. An original gabled roof rendered brick outbuildings also sits on the site. Until the late 20th century the house had always been painted shades of pale grey, with darker grey marking out window details etc., and some cream details.Pearman, J., pers.comm., 28 July 2009. The slate roof is hipped and a front gable contains a two-storey bay with segmental arched windows. The two storey verandah has been enclosed on the upper level. (RNE,1978). It features French windows onto ground floor verandah which also has thin columns. Four chimney pots on chimney. It was reported to be in excellent condition as at 4 May 2009, with original outbuildings, slate roof, chimneys, cast iron balustrades, posts, brackets, valences, timber back verandah, doors and windows. It also retains its original garden setting. The interior has been substantially altered to accommodate a school.LEP, 2000: last updated 3 December 2004. The four trees dating from 1884: two Norfolk Island pines (Araucaria heterophylla) and two evergreen magnolias/ bull bays (Magnolia grandiflora) are suffering due to too much paving close to their roots, reducing air and water supply. The pines have started to drop limbs.

The school secretary remembers it being used as a wine cellar in the 1970s prior to the demolition of the accompanying bungalow (Matthew Stephens, HHT, pers.comm, 26/6/09 - copies of the photographs are held in HHT's Caroline Simpson Library & Research Centre). * 1955-9 Prior to the building being opened as the Loftus Street Special School the original cast iron was removed and the upstairs verandahs were enclosed.

It has been dubbed Den grønne Snarvei 'the green shortcut' by the Hedmark county municipality. The route runs south from European Route E6 at Ulsberg in the municipality of Rennebu in Trøndelag county, via Tynset and Elverum, to Stange in Hedmark county, where it rejoins European Route E6. The route was long, of which are in Hedmark county and are in Trøndelag county. National Road 3 is the route most used for transport between Oslo and Trondheim, carrying approximately 90% of heavy traffic and most of the passenger car traffic between the two cities. This is because the route is about shorter in comparison to European Route E6, has better curvature, goes through fewer towns, and has smaller grades. Unlike the E6 over the Dovrefjell mountain range, National Road 3 is also never closed due to winter weather. There have therefore been proposals to reroute the E6 to Østerdalen (along the route of National Road 3). This is however not the official plan. Big money is spent to upgrade around 100 km of E6 (Øyer–Stange) to four-lane motorway and upgrade of long other parts of E6. Much less is spent on Road 3, although of four-lane motorway was opened in 2020, but not much more investment is planned. History From 1965 to 1992, National Road 3 followed a route from Ulsberg to Kongsvinger via Tynset and Elverum. The segment between Løten and Ommangsvolden was designated National Road 211. As part of the 1992 European route reform, the route from Elverum to Kongsvinger was redesignated National Road 20, and is now part of National Road 2.

It is also known as Rockdale Market Gardens and Chinese Market Gardens. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site demonstrates prolonged and continuous use as a market garden. Market gardens such as this played an important role in food production for the local and regional community, particularly during the Great Depression and Post and Inter-War periods. For much of the Great Depression, Chinese market gardens were the only source of fresh vegetables for urban dwelling Australians.  Description  A remnant market garden with associated asbestos cement building and corrugated iron outbuildings. The building sits on brick piers and has a gabled corrugated iron roof. The associated corrugated iron sheds are in a reasonable condition. The garden is divided into small strips, each of which has a different type of produce under cultivation. The site is surrounded by housing and open space/playing fields. As at 26 March 1999, the site consists of a market garden, under production, and an associated asbestos cement building, in reasonable repair. The site has some archaeological potential associated with its use as a market garden. In the context of an area which has been under cultivation for a century, the landscape appears to be intact. The associated buildings also appear to be intact but are generally in poor condition.  Heritage listing  The three market garden properties are of State significance for a number of reasons, but their primary importance is their continuous use for market gardening since at least the 1850s. This has resulted in the creation of a landscape that bears evidence of continuous work and the marketing of the changes that have taken place in the market gardening industry in that time. Evidence of this is present in built fabric, changes in ethnicity of occupants and the complexity of infrastructure. Their rarity has been further enhanced by ongoing changes to surrounding environments including urban re-development that absorbed the majority of surviving market gardens in the mid and late 20th century. They are rare survivors of the mid 19th century use of the area for market gardening. Outwardly the market gardens are a timeless scene with little intrusion by modern technology, which creates a semblance of their former appearance. They are representative of market gardens throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Their appearance and contribution to their settings is significant as a reminder of the area's long use for market gardening. The landscapes are strongly patterned, aesthetically pleasing and provide a transition between urban development and the renaturalised areas of the Botany lowlands. The Toomevara Lane Market Gardens are of State significance as one of only five surviving market gardens in the Sydney metropolitan region in largely their original form and still employing traditional cultivation practices. The site is of significance for its association with the Chinese, German, Irish and Cornish communities and for its demonstration of a continuing pattern of land usage since the mid-19th century market gardener's cottages in the Sydney metropolitan region and one of only four such cottages still attached to operating market gardens. The property is of State significance for its continuous use as a market garden since the land was first alienated for that purpose in the 1860s. It retains a strongly functional landscape reflecting both the long history of market gardening and operation that is typical of modern farming methods. The current use of the place is consistent with its significance and contributing to the continuity of use of the property. The scale of the property, the working largely by hand, the \\"making do\\" and recycling of fabric and general air of under- resourced functionality are essential aspects of the property's significance. Modern intrusions, notably motor cars and electricity, are acceptable changes that have been adopted as opportunity has risen. The Toomevara Lane Market Garden has some local significance for its associations, notably * Peter Herrmann and his family, who were prominent market gardeners in Sydney in the mid to late 19th century and amongst the first German immigrants to take up market gardening of Sydney * Peter Henry Wright, who operated the market garden from 1875-1890, one of the longest single ownership tenures in market gardening at the time. * James O'Meara and the O'Meara family who owned the site from 1899 to 1960, the longest period of ownership in the site's history * John Wilson (the original grantee) and John Hart, his solicitor, who started the market garden in 1866. Bordering wetland is of local significance as fish and bird breeding habitat. Immediate surrounding development and parkland diminishes the aesthetic and evocative landscape character that the other properties retain. The neighbouring land uses provide management challenges through trespass and noise that compromise the sensory experience.

Heritage listing  The Arncliffe Chinese Market Gardens are of high significance for their association with the Chinese community and their demonstration of a continuous pattern of land usage since the late nineteenth century. They are one of only three such surviving market gardens in the Inner Sydney region and one of few similar surviving examples in the Sydney Metropolitan Region. Arncliffe Market Gardens was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Arncliffe Market Gardens are of historical significance for their demonstration of a continuous pattern of land use since the late nineteenth century. They are also of significance for their association with the development of local industry and for their association with early Chinese immigration and the influence of ethnic communities on local industry. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Arncliffe Market gardens are of aesthetic significance as an important area of productive open space, providing visual variety from the other types of open space in the area. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Arncliffe Market Gardens are of high social significance for their association with early ethnic communities, especially Chinese, and for the role they have played in helping to feed the local and regional population, particularly during the Inter-War, Depression and Post- War periods. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Arncliffe Market Gardens have some technical/research significance for demonstrating early market gardening practices, particularly through the extant structure on the site relating to previous uses and remnant gardening equipment. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Market gardens such as this are becoming increasingly rare and the Arncliffe Market Gardens are of particular importance for their demonstration of a continuing pattern of usage from the late nineteenth century through to the 1930s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Whilst there are market gardens elsewhere in the metropolitan region, there are few that have been used continually as these have.

It was designed by the New South Wales Department of Public Works, who built the sewer from 1895 to 1898. It is also known as SWSOOS No. 1, Western Main Carrier and Western Main Outfall Sewer. The property is owned by Sydney Water. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  In 1859 Sydney's sewerage system consisted of five outfall sewers which drained to Sydney Harbour. By the 1870s, the Harbour had become grossly polluted and, as a result, the government created the Sydney City and Suburban Health Board to investigate an alternative means of disposing of the City's sewage. This led to the construction of two gravitation sewers in 1889 by the Public Works Department: a northern sewer discharging to the ocean near Bondi and a southern sewer draining to a sewage farm at Botany Bay. In 1888, the new Board of Water Supply and Sewerage was created, and in 1889, it took over the old outfall sewers and the PWD new works. The new works formed the basis of the two ocean outfall sewers which still serve the greater Sydney area south of the harbour: the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer (BOOS); and the Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer (SWSOOS No. 1). SWSOOS No1 consisted of two main sewer lines: the Southern Outfall Sewer, which was the first built in 1886 and ran northwards through the suburbs of Waterloo and Redfern, and reached the sewage farm by means of an inverted syphon passing under the Cooks River; and the Western Outfall Main Sewer which came into operation in 1898 and ran westwards from the sewage farm, before curling north to cross Wolli Creek and Cooks River to divide into three main branches which serve suburbs such as Strathfield, Burwood, Ashfield, Drummoyne, Leichhardt, Newtown, etc. The SWSOOS is now Sydney's largest sewage system, and because of its size, it is now designated in two main parts: No. 1 SWSOOS which serves Sydney's more southern suburbs; and No. 2 SWSOOS which serves Sydney's more south-western suburbs. The first section of the original Western Outfall Main Sewer, then known as \\"The Main Carrier\\", was an 804 metre long concrete open trough which then changed to three barrels which terminated at the Premier Street Penstock Chamber, where three main branches join. Along the way, the sewer crosses Wolli Creek and Cooks River on an aqueduct and bridge.  Description  The subject of this listing is that section of the sewer between Valda Avenue, Arncliffe and the SWSOOS merging chamber on the south side of Kogarah Golf Course. This section of the sewer consists of three 1.83m diameter brick barrels which are hidden by concrete and masonry encasement. The southerly end of this section of the sewer is supported on concrete arches, which now are completely obscured by fill and encasement. It is substantially intact.  Heritage listing  The Valda Avenue, Arncliffe to SWSOOS Merging Chamber section of the original Western Outfall Main Sewer is of historical and technical significance. Historically, it is an original section of one of Sydney's oldest main sewers, built in the 1890s to end the discharge of sewage into Sydney Harbour. Its flow originally terminated at the former Botany Sewage Farm (which was one of only two known large scale sewage farms built in Australia during the 19th century), with which it has close temporal and locational associations. Technically, the three brick barrels, which are encased in concrete, are an excellent example of the oviform brick construction method of the time, which have provided continuous service for over 100 years. Western Outfall Main Sewer was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This section of the Western Outfall Main Sewer is of historical significance, being one of Sydney's earliest main sewers, built in the 1890s to end the discharge sewage into Sydney Harbour. It is also significant for its association with the former Botany Sewage Farm, which it served until 1916, when the farm was superseded by the SWSOOS No .1. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Item does not have any notable outstanding aesthetic values. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Item is listed on the National Trust (NSW) register and is thus recognised by an identifiable group, and as such has importance to the broader community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The three barrels are an excellent example of the oviform brick construction method of the period, which have been in continuous operation for over 100 years and continues to give excellent service. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The brick barrels are a rare and unusual example of late 19th century sewer construction and are part of the highly significant SWSOOS sewer system which is the largest in the SWC system and likely NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The brick barrels are a representative example of late 19th century sewage construction.

It was designed by John Verge (villa) and Sheerin & Hennessy (Magdalene buildings), with the original villa built from 1833 to 1836. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Tempe estate was named after the \\"Vale of Tempe\\" in Ancient Greece, due to its extensive gardens, designed to enhance the view of the Cooks River. The house was commissioned in 1831 by renowned architect John Verge and is a rare example of his architectural style. The land was first released in 1809 as a series of three land grants, the largest portion awarded to Sergeant William Packer and the remaining two grants were reissued in 1810 by Governor Macquarie. Sergeant Packer sold his land to the original owner of Tempe House, Alexander Brodie Spark in 1826 for 100 pounds. Records from the 1828 census indicate that there were six people living and working on the estate at the time, and by the 1836 census, there were thirty-one people recorded as living and working on the estate.[Tanner & Associates, Conservation Management Plan, 2001: pp.7-11] Tempe Estate formed a deliberately modified natural element, identified as \\"Mt Olympus\\", which included Australian shrubbery, and created a suitable backdrop for a house in a picturesque setting.Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.131 The riverbanks were developed to lay extensive lawns, and as the property was only accessible by boat at the time, a wharf was constructed to accommodate guests; however, it was not completed until 1838.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.11]. The house after completion was used extensively for entertainment purposes and the scenic gardens included up to fifty differing varieties of grape vines from France, which also attracted horticultural awards.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.26] The construction of a dam between 1839 and 1841 was built from quarried stone in the surrounding cliffs by convict labour, and served to enhance the Estate's already splendid views. The dam allowed the area to be linked to the city by road, leading Spark, in 1841, to construct a carriage drive, a new coach house, stables and grooms quarters.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: pp.16-17] The stables burnt down in 1844, and were replaced, where they then remained until 1960.[Anglin and Associates, Conservation Plan: Tempe Estate, 1988: p.13]. 1840 saw A. B.Spark begin to face extensive business problems, with his personal borrowings seemingly insurmountable. He attempted to rectify his position by planting saleable crops, however, was eventually overcome and his insolvency was listed on 23 August 1843. He remained at Tempe Estate with his wife and children and attempted to sell twice, however, at the time of his death in 1856 his estate failed to meet his debts.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: pp.18-19] A. B. Spark was one of the original trustees of St Peters Anglican Church, St Peters. When Spark died he was buried in St. Peter's graveyard. The location of the grave is uncertain. Tempe Estate was subdivided, and the house was auctioned to brothers Patrick and Thomas Maguire on 24 August 1859 for 2000 pounds. The brothers never resided at Tempe Estate in their twenty years of ownership, however, leased the property out, most notably to Caroline Chisholm. In the years 1863 to 1865, Caroline Chisholm, seen as one of Australia's greatest philanthropists, ran an educational establishment for young ladies in Tempe House.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.22] In 1876, Tempe House was leased as a private residence to Mr C. T. Richardson.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.23] On 23 November 1884, Tempe Estate was sold at Auction to Frederick Gannon for 4000 pounds. He then sold it five months later for the sizable sum of 6,750 pounds to the Trustees of the Good Samaritan Order, Mary Anne Adamson, otherwise known as Superior General Magdalene and Margaret Mary Byrne. The Good Samaritan Order focused on unmarried mothers and women who were seen to be at risk of sin. By 1887, the sisters had raised enough money to build a penitentiary, laundries and accommodation. The new buildings accommodated forty penitents and were renamed St Magdalene's refuge, also known as The Retreat. A new Chapel was constructed in 1888, adjacent to the house, and by 1900, over one hundred people worked a daily routine in the laundry operations and an inquiry into the refuge over unpaid wages was settled in favour of the Order.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: pp.24-25] Renowned architects Sheerin and Hennessy were the principal architects employed to design the new penitentiary, laundries and accommodation for St Magdalene's Retreat. It is unclear who designed the Chapel, however, as it has a similar architectural style as the new buildings, the indication was that Sherrin and Hennessy were employed once again. Whilst further additions were made, the house remained largely unaltered until 1944-1945.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: pp.28-29] By 1944, the Retreat began to develop more into a training centre for the rehabilitation of delinquent girls, who had ended up in the court system, and in the 1940s, there were 55 girls housed at the Estate.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.32] Facilities to aid education were added in 1954, a swimming pool in 1959 and a chaplains residence in 1972. External conservation work was undertaken to repair deterioration on the verandah bays that was completed by Hurst and Kennedy architects in 1977.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.41]. The Good Samaritan Order remained in ownership of Tempe Estate for over 100 years and in 1989 sold it to Qantek, a branch of Qantas.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.37] 1990 saw a Permanent Conservation order established for Tempe Estate, including the house and surrounding grounds to the riverfront. The landscape was deemed to be of greater significance than the buildings associated with the Good Samaritan Order and subsequently, they were demolished with the exception of the Chapel and the iron fencing. The property passed possession from Qantek to Interciti Arncliffe Developments Pty. Ltd in 2000,[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.42] who have carried out staged high density development over the southern part of the former estate around a new railway station.  Description  Tempe house covers twelve (12) acres, subdivided into twelve (12) lots, and is confined on all sides by a rail line, the Cooks River, the Princes Highway and an industrial area, the building remains largely intact and is constructed from traditional bearing walls, timber floors and roof framing. The house is symmetrically detailed utilizing classic motifs.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.61] Tempe house stands amongst a scenic garden setting depicted as an ideal \\"Arcadian\\" landscape, with a long looped carriageway. The grounds are of exceptional importance for their ability to demonstrate close adherence to early nineteenth century design principles, including the modified natural element Mt Olympus - an unusual example of a detached shrubbery, and for surviving early fabric - walling, gateposts and sundial. They are important for their association for one hundred years with the Sisters of the Good Samaritan and for their framework of mature plantings, particularly the early Olea europaea subsp. europaea. The group of eucalypts on Mount Olympus has value in providing evidence of the natural vegetation on the site. Mount Olympus and the group of eucalypts which, as a group, are rare on a local level. These are an identifiable natural landmark on the Princes Highway. Mt. Olympus is a small hill on the eastern side of Tempe House, adjoining (on the south side of) the Cook's River. Immediately east of Mt. Olympus is the Princes Highway. Immediately south of it is an access road and high rise blocks of flats built since 2002. The results of a 2001 archeological assessment indicate that if any archaeological deposits relating to the early nineteenth century use of the site survive, then they are likely to be of high historical and archaeological significance. =Tempe House= The Northeast elevation boasts bull nose edged verandahs and principally retains the form of the original verandah. There are two pairs of cedar French doors with fanlights above. The windows are symmetrically positioned on the facade, as are the semi circular verandahs with Tuscan timber columns situated either side of the central stairway. The entrance has a wide eight paneled door.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: pp.62-63] The Southeast elevation incorporates a courtyard with simple detailing and one entry, that is the original six paneled wide cedar door. The original hipped roof is visible from the courtyard as is a small portion of the original verandah, however, the roof has been modified.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.64] The interior of the house has many of the rooms retaining French doors and there are early fireplaces, and six paneled doors throughout most of the common areas. Every room has views out to the trees, and the house revolves around a central hallway. The cedar joinery is finely molded, and is of a similar design throughout the intact areas of the house. The parlour and dining room both feature colonial marble fireplaces and French windows with large areas of glazing for optimal views of the river. There is evidence of the original floorboards in the rear rooms of the house.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.76-80] =St Magdalene's Chapel= St Magdalene's Chapel The chapel was built approximately fifty years after Tempe House and is constructed from good quality red brick with cream brick and sandstone detailing. The Chapel, like the house, represents the period of architectural style in which it was built. The Chapel is an example of Victorian Gothic architecture and measures approximately twenty metres long, by ten metres wide, and is a tall single story structure with a steeply sloping roof. The northeast elevation has stained glass windows with carved sandstone windowsills and simply detailed gables capped with corbelled sandstone eaves, copper guttering and circular down pipes. The southeast elevation has a simple rose window high on the gable end.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.72-74]. The interior of the chapel is plainly finished, and the detail of religious scenes in the stained glass windows is evident. The most striking feature is the vaulted cedar boarded ceiling supported by a series of arched ribs. The interior of the Chapel consists of mainly one large room, with the altar stretching the width of the building, and has an ornate balustrade of wrought iron and timber.[Tanner & Associates, 2001: p.81-82]  Heritage listing  Tempe House is of exceptional historical significance as a remarkably intact 1830s villa still within its largely unaltered landscape setting. Designed by John Verge, Tempe House is an exceptional and rare example of Neo-Classical Georgian architecture, self-consciously designed as an 'Arcadian villa\\" for a picturesque setting and the only such example in the Sydney Metropolitan area. The site's association with the historical figures of A.B. Spark, Tempe's original owner, and following occupants, Caroline Chisholm and the Sisters of The Good Samaritan Order is also of significance. The site's intact nature makes it a valuable technical and research resource. As the only remaining building from the long period of the Sisters of the Good Samaritan Order's ownership, the St. Magdalene's Chapel, is of high social significance and represents the philosophy and religious beliefs of what was a large and rare charitable institution operating throughout the late 19th and 20th century. Architecturally the St. Magdalene's Chapel is also noteworthy. Tempe Estate is of exceptional social significance in the local area and displays landmark qualities that can be appreciated from a wide surrounding area. The garden and grounds of Tempe House, on the Cooks River, at Wolli Creek are of cultural significance on a State level for their siting and development by A. B. Spark according to Romantic Picturesque principles. Tempe Estate is a rare example of an 1830s villa which is still able to be appreciated in its landscape setting. The grounds are of exceptional importance for their ability to demonstrate close adherence to early nineteenth century design principles, including the modified natural element Mt Olympus - an unusual example of a detached shrubbery, and for surviving early fabric - walling, gateposts and sundial. They are important for their association for one hundred years with the Sisters of the Good Samaritan and for their framework of mature plantings, particularly the early Olea europaea subsp.

Mount Olympus and the group of eucalypts which, as a group, are rare on a local level. These are an identifiable natural landmark on the Princes Highway. The potential archaeological remains within the study area have a high level of historic and archaeological significance and research potential. The archaeological excavation and analysis of the remains associated with Tempe House occupation are likely to further our understanding of the colonial occupation of the house, and the material culture and living standards of elite families, their staff and convict servants and colonial attitudes towards gardens and recreation. The potential archaeological evidence associated with the occupation of the site by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan and their reform institution should provide important information, the analysis and interpretation of which will advance our understanding of reform ideology in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth centuries in Australia. Tempe House & St Magdalenes Chapel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The house and gardens of Tempe Estate remain uniquely intact, which offers a rare opportunity for understanding the cultural history of New South Wales. The estate is of historic significance as the grounds and gardens exemplify an historic and picturesque example of typical British models of 19th century landscape styles. Tempe House belongs to a select group of houses owned by prominent individuals in the colony. The unique intactness of Tempe House and the landscape setting of the Estate contributes to an understanding of the cultural history of New South Wales. The Tempe estate is of considerable historical significance as it represents the picturesque aspirations of men of Spark's class during the boom years of the 1830s, and how those aspirations were carried out in the Australian colonial setting. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The property has a strong historical connection with Alexander Brodie Spark, an important social figure in New South Wales. Spark, a wealthy entrepreneur of the 1830s also built Tusculum at Potts Point, (now the headquarters of the NSW Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects). He was the largest landholder in the Cooks River area, was instrumental in the building of the St Peters Church and establishing the early community there. He also made popular the Cooks River area through his patronage of the arts, Tempe and the surrounding areas being the subject of numerous paintings by well known artist since the 1840s largely due to Sparks connections and the picturesque scheme he established on the estate. Many of Spark's original documents are available today and together with the intactness of the Tempe Estate provide an extremely rare and valuable historical asset. As such Tempe Estate and its connection to Spark have exceptional historical significance. The site is associated with several people of renown. As well as the original owner Spark, the Estate is also associated with the architect John Verge who designed the house in 1833, the architects Sheerin and Hennessy who designed the Chapel 1888 and Caroline Chisolm who operated a girls school from the site for a period. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house and setting of Tempe Estate are particularly significant as a consciously designed \\"Arcadian Villa\\". Spark erected a house designed by John Verge in keeping with his vision of a Grecian inspired temple. The picturesque ideal involved contrasting tamed expanses of open landscape with clusters of rough or \\"wild\\" outcrops of rocks or stands of trees. Tempe House was placed to take advantage of the ideal romantic and picturesque site on the Cooks River with the \\"Mt Olympus\\" knoll as backdrop. Both the setting and the house designed for it remain an exceptionally intact example of picturesque landscaping and design from the 1830s. These same aspects can be appreciated today despite the many constraints of its setting. The open space leading to the Cooks River provides views of the surrounding area and Fatima Island that are integral to the landscaped scheme and are of considerable aesthetic importance. The surviving views are similar to those shown in the earliest illustrations both from the northern side of the river toward the house and from the house looking northward across the river. The open space is of importance not only as a historical scheme but also for the contemporary community as the Tempe Estate can be appreciated from many surrounding vantage points. As such, the landscape of Tempe Estate must be seen as highly significant. Tempe Estate has landmark qualities as an exceptional space within the local landscape. The \\"Olympus Knoll\\" and exposed cliff face beside Princes Highway and the open parkland from the river combine to give the site landmark qualities. Consciously designed as an \\"Arcadian Villa\\" Tempe house and setting was designed to take advantage of the optimal views and splendor of the Cooks River. With the backdrop of \\"Mt Olympus\\", the house is aesthetically significant as it provides an exceptional example of an 1830s landscape design. Tempe house exemplifies the work of John Verge and includes detail that is not found in his other works. It is the intactness of the original elements in the estate, which generates an extremely high aesthetic significance. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. During the Sisters of the Good Samaritan Order ownership, the site functioned as a place of welfare orientated activities. While not initially opened to the public, the later period of eth Order's administration involved sharing the facility with local religious and sporting groups. Tempe House is also of social significance as a landmark to the local community. The house's association with A.B. Spark, who was active in establishing the local community and the St Peters Church and entertained extravagantly, adds to the social significance of the house. The house can be seen to have functioned as a focus for community activities during Spark's ownership. The subsequent use by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan for community welfare activities enhances the importance of this association. St Magdalen's Chapel was built by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan Order and designed by architects Sheerin & Hennessy is historically significant as a representation of the occupation of the site for over a century by the Benedictine Order. The stained glass windows directly memorialise the former Superiors of the Order, while the lives and beliefs of the many other women that lived and worked in the St Magdalen's Retreat are indirectly represented by the Chapel buildings itself. While the many other buildings constructed during the Order's period of ownership have been demolished, the Chapel remains a significant historical component within the site. The Chapel building is significant as the spiritual focus for almost a century of charitable works at Tempe by the Sisters of eth Good Samaritan Order. It represents not only the religious devotion of the Sisters living on the site, but also the philosophy of repentance drining the charitable works that governed the operations of the \\"Retreat\\" during the extensive period of the Order's ownership. Tempe House and its surrounding landscape have considerable esteem at both a local and a state level. Contemporary interest in the remnant estate, including the natural vegetation on Mount Olympus clearly demonstrates the value attached to the gardens and grounds as an integral component of Tempe House. Tempe Estate has been the subject of several major landscape paintings since the 1830s. That the view of Tempe that has been recorded by artists throughout the last two centuries remains largely intact is of significance to the community familiar with the paintings as well as the wider community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site offers a significant opportunity to investigate and study a rare and early example of colonial architecture and landscape. That Tempe Estate has been the subject of several major landscape paintings since the 1830s and that those views largely remain today is of significance for providing a rare opportunity to view the preferred subject matter of 19th century Australian picturesque landscape paintings. The remaining features of the garden and grounds of Tempe have the potential to reveal the early cultural and natural landscape of eth place. The archaeological remains on the site have the potential to provide evidence associated with not just Spark and his family but also with the large number of servants and convict staff used to establish and maintain the estate. The analysis and interpretation of the archaeological remains from this site should provide evidence of the material culture of the various occupants of the house as well as contributing to the understanding of the design and development of gardens in colonial Sydney. The archaeological structures and remains on the site would be able to contribute knowledge into several research questions: The material culture of Tempe House and grounds are likely to contain artefacts and structures whose analysis can provide us with socio- economic information about elite living conditions, including patterns of consumption. It will also inform us about working, accommodation and living conditions for convicts on colonial properties. The analysis of the underfloor deposits should be able to add to our knowledge about identification of socio- economic status, gender relations and other areas of substantive archaeological research. Location of structural remains of outbuildings associated with Tempe House will add to and improve our understanding of the layout of early colonial estates. Recording the location and construction of the gardens elements will contribute to knowledge about colonial garden design in Sydney. Interpretation of this evidence will help inform us about the ideological influences involved in the design of this landscape. The archaeological evidence associated with the Sisters of the Good Samaritan and their institutional buildings should shed light on the changing practices of reformatory institutions and the practices of reform and respite. There is great interest in the practices of institutions, in how they controlled the lives of inmates to achieve certain ideological intentions. In this case helping women to \\"renounce their evil habits\\". The potential for intact archaeological evidence associated with the Sisters of the Good Samaritan would provide substantive evidence as to how this late nineteenth century reform institution operated and the way in which the ideology of reform and resistance to it impacted on the physical structure as well as the material artefacts. The reformatory period evidence may also help inform us about the attitudes of the dominant ideology towards women and how gender relations were constructed between the women inmates and between them and their (female) supervisors. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The house combined with its setting is a rare example of a relatively intact picturesque landscape scheme from the 1830s and 1840s. The integrity of the twelve acres of land immediately surrounding the house offers a rare opportunity for the appreciation of a picturesque aesthetic as designed in the early nineteenth century. Tempe is a rare and exceptionally intact example of John Verge's work. It is a unique example of a Georgian neo-Classical design, fulfilling both the criteria of the villa and the cottage orne. St. Magdalene's Chapel, although relatively plainly finished on the exterior, contains some very unusual features, notably: corbelled stone eaves; stone pediments above apse windows, which project above eaves line at the northern end; vaulted cedar boarded ceiling of rare design. Although not as developed as other examples at Elizabeth Bay House (no longer extant) or Government House, the survival of the Australian shrubbery within the garden is rare. The group of eucalypts and associated vegetation on Mount Olympus has some scientific value as an indicator of the natural vegetation communities of this part of the Estate. The use of the main house by the various occupants could be elucidated by archaeological evidence. Archaeological investigation and analysis of the site is likely to reveal remains and information not available from other sources. The site may contribute data relevant to early nineteenth-century households and economic status in this part of Sydney. The opportunity to examine archaeological assemblages that might contribute to such knowledge is rare and diminishing. The artefact assemblage should reflect all classes of people who lived in the house: owners, servants and convicts. The evidence associated with the reform institutions is rare and if it survives with any level of integrity it provides knowledge that no other resource can. This site has the potential to contain archaeological remains associated with two significant phases of occupation of the site. The occupation by Alexander Spark and family and the reform institution operated by the Sisters of the Good Samaritan. The knowledge to be gained from the analysis of the archaeological material excavated from the study area is relevant to general and substantive problems relating to the archaeology and history of Australia. Some of the areas of research that are germane to historical archaeology are questions relating to: * colonial attitudes towards house and garden design and private recreation * identification, analysis and interpretation of living conditions and class structure within nineteenth-century society and how this evidence is structured within the archaeological resource; * working, accommodation and living conditions for convists on colonial properties; * examination of the role of gender relations and how it structured nineteenth-century life especially with reference  References  = Bibliography =      = Attribution = External links Category:19th-century establishments in Australia Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Chapels in Sydney Category:Houses in Sydney Category:Convents in Australia Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:1836 establishments in Australia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1836 Category:Wolli Creek, New South Wales Category:John Verge buildings ","title":"Tempe House and St Magdalenes Chapel"},{"id":"57988352","text":"The Office of the Attorney General of the Northern Mariana Islands provides \\"legal counsel and representation to the...government and its agencies in many issues vital to the people’s interest.

It was built in 1885 by Frederick Gibbins. It is also known as Macquarie Lodge and Dapetto. The property is owned by the Salvation Army. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Frederick John Gibbins (builder and owner of Dappeto 1885 to 1917) was born on 25 May 1841 at Dappeto - an Aboriginal name for the area south of Wollongong, later variously known as Dapto or Mullet Creek. Frederick Gibbins was the eldest child of John and Ann Gibbins (née Meredith) who were married at St. Luke's Anglican Church, Liverpool, NSW on 16 March 1840. John Gibbins arrived in Australia on the \\"Claudine\\" in 1829 after having been sentenced to 14 years transportation for stealing a handkerchief. Frederick John's mother, Ann, was a granddaughter of First Fleeter Meredith, Steward to Captain John Marshall of the \\"Scarborough\\". In 1865 Frederick John Gibbins met and married Catherine Pickett and they had a family of six sons and three daughters - Alfred, Emma (Pattison), Amy (Thom), Ernest, Frederick, Walter, Edwin, Ada (Stead) and Percy. Percy died at the old family home in Kent Street, Sydney, in early 1885 just prior to the move to Dappeto. From 1885 to 1917 Dappeto was the home of the Gibbins family. The home stood on 11 acres of land, part portion 61, Parish of St. George one of four adjoining portions included in a Crown Grant made to Thomas Hill Bardwell on 5 September 1853. On 18 September 1879, Portion 61 was sold to George Penkivil Salde who in turn sold the land to Frederick John Gibbins on 6 August 1881. In 1885 the building of Dappeto was completed and became the family home of the Gibbins family until the death of Mr Gibbins in 1917 and the final sale and settlement of the estate. Frederick Gibbins was an oyster merchant and trawling magnate. About 1906 he entered into partnership with three other large oyster merchants, Comino Athanassio, Charles Edward Woodward and John Moriarty, and the firm, known as Woodward, Gibbons & Comino, dominated oyster marketing in New South Wales. In 1917 the Salvation Army purchased Dappeto and part of the original site - Lots 33 to 36 and 54-59 Section B, Portion 61 for the purpose of establishing a Children's Home. It remained in operation as such until 1969 when the children in residence were transferred to the Stanmore Children's Home and plans for a Senior Citizens' Complex were prepared. In 1971 the Senior Citizen's Complex was completed containing self-contained units, a bed hostel and nursing home. The complex was renamed Macquarie Lodge. The wing at the rear of Dapetto that housed the kitchen, laundry and servants' accommodation was demolished and replaced with the present nursing home. Following its nomination by Rockdale Council an Interim Heritage Order was placed over Dappeto on 14 May 1986. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 17 February 1989 and transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Dappeto is a two-storey house of domestic style Victorian architecture. It was constructed of sand-stock face bricks which were mixed with whale oil to protect the building against dampness. It has a patterned slate roof surmounted by an ornate captain's walk accessed by a cast iron spiral staircase. The two storey verandah has an iron balustrade and trim to the upper floor and frieze to the lower floor. It features several beautiful fireplaces and overmantles of various imported English timbers. The name Dapetto appears above the fanlight. A Coat of Arms with initials F. J. G. is above the side bay windows.  Heritage listing  Dappeto is of State heritage significance as an excellent example of domestic style Victorian architecture. It is associated with Frederick Gibbins, an oyster merchant and trawling magnate. Dappeto was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

She is frequently quoted in print and television media as an academic expert in inequality and American higher education. In 2020, McMillan Cottom was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in recognition of her work \\"at the confluence of race, gender, education, and digital technology.\\"  Early life and education  North Carolina Central University, where McMillan Cottom earned her BA McMillan Cottom was born in Harlem and raised in Winston-Salem and Charlotte, North Carolina. Her mother was a member of the Black Panther Party in Winston-Salem. Before completing her undergraduate degree McMillan Cottom worked as an enrollment officer at a technical college, a job that would inform her later research and her first book. McMillan Cottom received her B.A. from North Carolina Central University, a public HBCU, in English and political science. While pursuing her Ph.D. at Emory University McMillan Cottom worked as a visiting fellow at the University of California, Davis Center for Poverty Research and as a Microsoft Research Social Media Collective intern. She also wrote the biweekly \\"Counter Narrative\\" column for Slate magazine. She earned her PhD in sociology from Emory University in 2015 with a dissertation on the legitimacy of for-profit higher education institutions. Career In 2015 McMillan Cottom was appointed as an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University and a faculty associate at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. She was awarded tenure and promoted to the rank of associate professor in 2019. In 2020, she left Virginia Commonwealth University to join the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. =Public intellectual= Before the publication of her book Lower Ed McMillan Cottom was known primarily as an essayist and academic expert on issues of inequality, higher education, and race.Examples of coverage:  She writes from the analytical perspective of intersectionality. Her essays have advocated for reparations to African Americans, identified racism rather than political correctness as the real threat to university campus life, and suggested that black girls are treated as more adult than white girls. She is a contributing editor at Dissent and one of HuffPost's commissioned opinion columnists.; In addition to her own writing, McMillan Cottom has been featured in The New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), Harvard Educational Review, Mother Jones, Inside Higher Ed, and The Daily Show. Drawing on her experience dealing with controversy as a public intellectual, McMillan Cottom wrote a guide for academics who come under public attack from organized digital campaigns. In 2019, McMillan Cottom and Roxane Gay launched a podcast called Hear to Slay to \\"amplify the voices and work of black women\\". McMillan Cottom received the Public Understanding of Sociology Award from the American Sociological Association in 2020. = Lower Ed = McMillan Cottom's 2017 book Lower Ed is an analysis of the for-profit educational sector from the perspective of students trying to navigate a \\"risky and highly variable\\" economy. Lower Ed is based on interviews with students and college executives, analysis of for-profit college promotional materials, and McMillan Cottom's own experience working as an enrollment officer at two for-profit institutions. The main finding is that rising emphasis on credentialism in the American job market pushes students to make riskier but individually rational trade-offs in order to obtain educational credentials. According to McMillan Cottom, for-profit institutions are generally more expensive than non-profit institutions and aggressively market to low-income and working poor students who qualify for the most financial aid, but students are making considered choices about their futures and are not simply being duped by marketing. Lower Ed suggests that policies intended to constrain the marketing behavior of for-profit institutions will not address the underlying political economy issue, and may increase inequalities, especially gender inequalities, in the distribution of valued educational credentials and jobs. Harvard Educational Review described Lower Ed as \\"theoretically provocative, empirically rich, and enjoyable to read\\". = Thick = McMillan Cottom's book Thick: And Other Essays was published by The New Press in 2019. John Warner, writing for the Chicago Tribune, described Thick as \\"the story of Cottom's life\\" but also \\"a kind of manifesto\\". The book draws on examples from McMillan Cottom's own life, including sexual abuse, divorce, and the death of a child, to discuss broader issues in race, beauty, and education, such as why black women can never be seen as beautiful, why universities prefer African students to African American students, and how assumptions about wealth, competence, and pain undermine black women's efforts to achieve health and financial security. Publishers Weekly gave Thick a starred review, concluding that \\"the collection showcases Cottom's wisdom and originality\\". Rebecca Stoner, writing for Pacific Standard, praised the broad appeal of Thick, noting that McMillan Cottom \\"makes it possible for her readers, whether or not they are black women, to understand the interdependent nature of our oppressions\\". The New York Times praised \\"the author’s skillful interweaving of the academic with the popular\\" and concluded that Thick \\"is sure to become a classic of black intellectualism\\".

By the early 1920s, the Cleveland mafia had taken over the Mayfield Road Mob and become the dominant criminal organization in Cleveland. It was led by boss Joseph \\"Big Joe\\" Lonardo. While visiting family in Italy, Lonardo lost control of the Cleveland mafia to Salvatore \\"Black Sam\\" Todaro and Joseph \\"Big Joe\\" Porrello. Lonardo demanded his business back when he returned to the United States, but was murdered by the Porrellos on June 23, 1927. Todaro was killed by the Lonardos on June 11, 1929. Joseph Porello took over the crime family, but he began to be pushed aside by Frank Milano, who was by now head of a resurgent Mayfield Road Mob. Porrello began reasserting his power, and demanded that Milano turn over cash owed to him as well as make a large monetary payment as a sign of his loyalty. Milano agreed to do so. On July 5, 1930, Porello and his bodyguard, Sam Tilocco, went to Milano's restaurant, the Venetian, at 12601 Mayfield Road in Cleveland's Little Italy neighborhood. The two sat at a table with Milano and Milano associates John Angersola, Charles Colletti, and Chuck Polizzi. Within minutes, Porrello was dead. Tilocco crawled outside, and died on the sidewalk. A series of revenge killings left Milano's Mayfield Road Mob in control of the Cleveland crime family. =Activities as head of the Cleveland crime family= He was a close associate of Cleveland crime family members George Angersola, John Angersola, Alfred Polizzi, and John Scalish, and co-owned Tornello Importing Co., an olive oil importation business, with Alfred Polizzi. Milano was also allegedly close to Mayfield Road Mob member N. Louis \\"Babe\\" Triscaro, who later became president of Local 436 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. With the start of Prohibition in 1920, Milano got involved in the distribution and sale of illegal alcoholic beverages. He and fellow mobster Louis Cohen ran a speakeasy at 7310 Lexington Avenue in Cleveland. After police closed it down in 1926, Milano and Cohen opened a restaurant on Hough Avenue. In 1929, Milano met Moe Dalitz, who ran bootlegging, illegal gambling, and rackets in Detroit, Michigan. The two became close friends. In April 1931, Salvatore Maranzano, head of the Castellammarese clan in New York City, declared himself capo di tutti capo (boss of all bosses). Lucky Luciano, who opposed Maranzano's claim to control the Luciano crime family, decided to have Maranzano murdered. On April 21, 1931, he met in Cleveland with Frank Milano, Moe Dalitz, Meyer Lansky, Santo Trafficante Sr., and an emissary sent by Al Capone. The five agreed with Luciano's plan to kill Maranzano and establish a new federation of crime families to handle disputes. After the September 10, 1931, assassination of Maranzano, the title of capo di tutti capo was retired and \\"The Commission\\" established by the American Mafia. Milano was named a member of The Commission, alongside Joseph Bonanno, Al Capone, Tommy Gagliano, Lucky Luciano, Vincent Mangano, and Joe Profaci. Frank Milano and Moe Dalitz became partners in the Molaska Corporation, which manufactured dehydrated molasses for use in alcohol distillation. Other criminal investors in the Molaska Corporation included Lansky, Luciano, and Frank Costello (Luciano's lieutenant). Dehydrated molasses was sold to alcohol manufacturers nationwide, allowing Milano to accumulate a large fortune during Prohibition. As Prohibition came to a close, Dalitz advised Milano to expand into new criminal activities. Beginning in 1930, Dalitz and Milano joined with Cleveland mobster Thomas J. McGinty to open casinos (of which the Thomas Club and Harvard Club were two) and lease illegal slot machines to local businesses. According to Angelo Lonardo, he sought permission from Milano to kill Giuseppe \\"Dr. Joe\\" Romano whom Lonardo believed to be involved in the murder of his father, Joseph \\"Big Joe\\" Lonardo. Milano approved the assassination, which occurred on June 10, 1936. Lonardo claims that Milano later denied authorizing the killing. While a member of the Cleveland crime family, he lived in Akron, Ohio, and made extensive real estate purchases there. Flight to Mexico On January 30, 1935, Milano fled to Mexico to avoid prosecution for income tax evasion. He took up residence in Vera Cruz. As he could not run the Cleveland crime family from across the border, he stepped down as boss and was succeeded by Alfred Polizzi. The Mexican government granted Milano a permanent visa on April 13, 1942. While living in Mexico, Milano engaged in a wide range of criminal activities. According to Alvin G. Sutton, Cleveland's top law enforcement officer, Milano smuggled individuals who had been deported from the U.S. back over the American border. When Wilbur Clark built the Desert Inn casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1947, he sought and received capital from a group of gamblers and mobsters that included Moe Dalitz, Maurice Kleinmann, Thomas J. McGinty, Louis Rothkopf, and Sammy Tucker. A few years later, this group sold a piece of their investment to John Angersola, Frank Milano, and Alfred Polizzi. In return, the Cleveland crime family agreed to prevent other organized crime figures from interfering with the casino. According to the Chicago Sun-Times in 1966, cash skimmed from the casino (representing Milano's percentage interest in the operation) was delivered to him in Mexico City without going through others (such as Meyer Lansky). Milano also purchased a good deal of real estate in Mexico. He owned a coffee plantation and owned extensive timberlands. Los Angeles criminal activities Milano relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he associated with Mickey Cohen and Lucky Luciano. According to nightclub owner and former police officer Barney Ruditsky, Milano helped protect Cohen from being murdered by other crime families. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, he owned a wire service that reported the results of horse racing. Using his wealth, Milano financed a wide range of illegal activities, although poor health kept him from any active participation in organized crime. He continued to purchase real estate in and around Los Angeles, as well as in Miami, Florida (where Alfred Polizzi had retired in 1948). He was considered one of the \\"top echelon\\" figures in organized crime nationwide. =Death= Milano died in Los Angeles on September 15, 1970, of natural causes. Relatives Frank Milano's wife, Marie, was at one time a close friend of Mickey Cohen's. Frank Milano's brother, Antonio (also known as Anthony Milano, Anthony Milana, and Tony Milano), was born in 1888. From 1930 to 1976, he was underboss of the Cleveland crime family. Anthony Milano's sons, Frank Angelo Milano (also known as John J. Gallo), John J. Milano, and Peter John Milano, were also suspected members of organized crime families in Los Angeles.

It is located midway between Three Fingers to its north, and Liberty Mountain to its south. Big Bear Mountain is situated in the Boulder River Wilderness on land administered by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Sauk and Stillaguamish Rivers. Climate Big Bear Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It is located in the desert area of Saih Al Salam in the emirate of Dubai and comprises some 10% of the total land area of the emirate, including the extensive man-made desert wetlands, Al Qudra Lakes.  Ecology and geography  The reserve spans over of desert shrub land and of lakes and is home to 26 identified species of reptiles, nine of mammals and 39 species of plants. It provides a sanctuary for 19 animal species considered endangered, as well as flocks of between 300 and 500 flamingos and over 360 other bird species, of which 158 are migratory. Rare species observed at Al Marmoom include the Egyptian Nightjar and the butterfly Coeliades Anchises Jucunda, which is native to the island of Socotra, off Yemen.  History  Its announcement, in January 2018, followed public concern regarding the fouling of the area by tourists as well as a number of deaths of birds and fish in the lakes.  Management  Al Marmoom is managed by Dubai Municipality, The formalisation of the reserve has introduced some restrictions to human leisure activity in the area, long a popular visiting place for residents. The move to regulate camping, barbecuing and picnicking was welcomed by the Emirates Environmental Group (EEG), an organisation that had organised cleanup campaigns in the area in the past. The Marmoom Biosphere Centre is intended as a facility for studying the sustainable development and management of the reserve, as well as serving as a centre for sustainable ecotourism, and will aim to be the main source of specialized ecosystem management practices in the region.  Leisure activities  The Reserve currently has a number of animal and bird observation platforms, star and sunset observation decks and an 84 km cycling track, one of the world's largest. There is an ongoing development program for the reserve, including bird breeding programs as well as the development of an outdoor theatre and other facilities intended to be powered by a 5,000 megawatt solar power plant. Al Marmoom is served by one of Dubai's distinctive 'Last Exit' food truck parks. Star gazing events are often held at Al Marmoom by Dubai Astronomy Group as the area has little to no light pollution. Some 20 sporting and social events have taken place in the Reserve since its launch, including a junior fun day organised Pink Caravan, the UAE-based breast cancer awareness initiative. The Bab Al Shams Desert Resort & Spa is situated close to the Reserve.  Archaeological site  The Saruq Al Hadid Archaeological Site is situated within the Reserve. It was discovered in 2002 by the Ruler of Dubai, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who noticed unusual dune formations when flying over the site in his helicopter. Excavations revealed an extensive Iron Age metallurgical centre, with signs of occupation since the Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic eras. Artefacts unearthed at Saruq Al Hadid include bronze, copper and iron work, including bronze and iron tools and weapons, gold jewellery, beads, pottery, stoneware and seals. Metalworker's tools and unfinished items show that the site was formerly a production centre. A collection of artefacts from the site is housed at the Saruq Al-Hadid Archaeology Museum in the Shindaga Heritage area in a traditional barjeel building, which was built in 1928, and which belonged to Sheikh Juma bin Maktoum bin Hasher Al Maktoum.

Wong became the first Asian to win the prestigious international Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition for young conductors held in Bamberg, Germany on 12 May 2016. One of Singapore's most prolific conductors, he will lead as the chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra in Germany for four years from September 2018. Personal life Born in 1986 to father Victor Wong, a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) warrant officer and mother Yeo Huay Lan, a childcare teacher, Wong has two younger brothers working in engineering and tourism. His family lives in a five-room HDB flat in Jurong West Street 42. At age seven in Primary 1 at the Jurong Primary School, he was asked by his maths teacher, who was also in charge of the brass band, to join the school brass band where he played the cornet. At River Valley High School, he joined a concert band playing the trumpet. At Raffles Junior College, he was with the symphonic band and took music as an GCE A-level subject. Coming from a modest Mandarin-speaking background where more Mandarin than English was spoken, Western classical music was not a part of his family life. He first came into contact with a Western symphony orchestra with strings after he stood in for a Junior College friend who was unable to go for rehearsals at the Singapore National Youth Orchestra (SNYO). Later, he had free one-to-one lessons with musicians from the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) where he realised he could have a career in a professional orchestra. He was with the SAF military band during his national service when he suffered a nerve injury to his lips from over-playing the trumpet. As he was unable to play for a few months, he started composing. To play his music composition, he formed his own team of musicians from his NS mates, conducted himself, and got into conducting. He also started considering becoming a professional conductor. After Raffles Junior College, he could be offered a place do physics in Cambridge with his A-level results. It was at this point when he was offered a full scholarship from the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music at the National University of Singapore that he decided to study music composition as he had \\"always wanted to be a professional musician.\\" After graduation in 2011, he worked as a conducting assistant with the Singapore Chinese Orchestra where under the mentorship of music director Tsung Yeh, he got a good grasp of both Western and Chinese music. In 2011, he commenced his study in opera and orchestral conducting at the Hochschule für Musik \\"Hanns Eisler\\" in Berlin, Germany, after receiving the distinguished Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship. He got his master's in 2014. Career Debuted in March 2015 with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Wong has since led orchestras in more than 20 cities in four continents, including the Berlin Konzerthaus Orchestra, the St Petersburg Symphony Orchestra and the Santa Fe Symphony Orchestra. In 2016, he became the first Asian to win the prestigious international Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition for young conductors held in Bamberg, Germany. In June 2016, he debuted in China, conducting for China Philharmonic Orchestra, Beiijing, the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra. He was nominated and a finalist for the 2017 Singapore Youth Award – Singapore's highest honour for young people who exemplify the values of resilience, courage, leadership, and willingness to serve, given out by the National Youth Council. In August 2018, Wong was one of 10 Singaporeans who got special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech, where he highlighted Singaporeans who followed their passion and broke new ground. From September 2018, he will lead as the chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra in Germany for four years. He will conduct the New York Philharmonic's annual Lunar New Year concert in February 2019. Since the 2016 Gustav Mahler win, many doors has opened for him where he is booked until 2020.

While still at school she took evening classes at the Liverpool School of Art. She continued to take evening classes when she left school and took a job in a department store to support her relatives when her father died. In 1940 she married Don Bradford, who worked for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board and served overseas during World War II. In 1942 Dorothy Bradford took a job in London with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, CEMA. Working in the art department of CEMA, Bradford helped organise art and design exhibitions. In wartime London she took evening classes at the Central School of Art including the life-classes taught by Raymond Coxon. She also took courses at Saint Martin's School of Art and later at Leeds College of Art. Working for CEMA gave Bradford the opportunity to attend many music and ballet performances and rehearsals, which were to become the main subject of her art. After the war Bradford left CEMA and moved to Liverpool where she and her husband raised a family. Bradford continued to paint and built a reputation for depicting musicians in performance. She was the official artist attached to the 1971 tour of America by the New Philarmonia Orchestra and also for the Leeds International Piano Competition. She also spent periods recording the work of the Northern School of Music and at Sadler's Wells theatre.

While the emblematic altered is a short-wheelbase roadster with exposed engine and front frame rails, very similar to the earliest rail dragsters, altereds can be bodied cars also.McClurg, Diggers, passim. By definition, altereds were essentially stock gas, alcohol, or fuel-class cars with parts removed or changed, making them ineligible for the previous class, such as Keith Ferrell's Dogcatcher, a 1936 Willys delivery; built as a gasser, Ferrell deliberately left something off to run it in B/Altered.Davis, Larry. Gasser Wars (Cartech, 2003), p. 170. History The Altered category originated \\"for cars with moderate changes\\", according to the rulebook.quoted in McClurg, Diggers, p. 44. It developed from out of the Hot Roadster, Fuel Coupé, and Fuel Sedan categories.McClurg, Diggers, p. 44 caption. In 1956, it was divided in three classes by weight break: A (up to ), B (), and C ( and up). Rules allowed moving the engine back up to 25% of the wheelbase, as well as chopping and channeling, which were prohibited in gassers. The class had few limits or requirements.Genat, Robert. \\"1939 Fiat Coupe Altered\\", written 21 April 2010, at Hot Rod Magazine online (retrieved 22 May 2017) One of the pioneers was Walt's Puffer II, an unsupercharged A/Altered Fiat Topolino powered by a 392 hemi, driven by Walt Kinoch.

That rose again in 1961, to , and by the time the car was retired, it had a best pass of 8.98 at . The #554 Coupé was powered by a supercharged hemi (a block) on between 40% and 75% nitro. It routinely filled the cockpit with smoke and burned rubber and clutch dust; track marshals once asked Faust if he needed help after exiting the smoking car, to which Faust casually replied, \\"Why? This thing does this all the time.\\"McClurg, Diggers, p. 45 caption. In 1957, NHRA banned nitro in all categories; the American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) still allowed it, and Fuel Dragsters (FD), Hot Roadsters (HR), and Fuel Coupés (FC), in the days before Funny Car, went there instead: it would be Drag News and their Standard 1320 record which christened them Fuel Altereds. AHRA grouped coupés and roasters together, unlike NHRA, under Hot Car Eliminator (HCE). Independent drag strips, not NHRA sanctioned, offered venues for the fuel racers.

They were given a blown hemi by Charlie Brent (after he wrecked his AA/FD), and built Nanook II around it, enabling the car to exceed at Orange County International Raceway McClurg, Diggers, p. 52. The car was turned into a jigsaw puzzle, now \\"highly collectible\\" among drag racing fans, by Hallmark Cards.

This led to an exclusive Fuel Altereds Nationals in Tucson, Arizona, in 1976, attended by the likes of Dave \\"Nasty\\" Benjamin and Jimmy West. Dennis Geisler campaigned the Instant T fuellie, then moved up to Funny Car, driving for a number of owners before fielding his own car in 1978. Based in Phoenix, Arizona, West ran the Chevrolet-powered Wild Wild West AA/FA; his brother, Johnny, ran a similar car in the middle 1970s. Leon Fitzgerald and Jack Eskelson collaborated on a '48 Topolino altered, powered by an injected Chevrolet; they would later add a supercharger, leading to a best time of 9.55 at . Fitzgerald and Eskelson would be joined by R. T. Reed and Richard Rockman, at Fitzgeralds's Anaheim Speed Engineers shop, in producing their most famous creation, the AA/FA match racer Pure Heaven, starting in 1965. Fitzgerald would drive this car in dozens of meetings against Pure Hell, driven by Dale Emery (for car owner Rich Guasco). Pure Heaven would run in the high 7s, with a best speed of , before being replaced by the big-block Chevrolet-engined Pure Heaven II, in 1967. Pure Heaven II would run on opening day of the new Orange County Raceway (now OCIR) on 5 August that year. There was crossover between classes.

Altereds were highly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. At the 1977 Winternationals in Pomona, California, more than 75 altereds contested for the Competition Eliminator title. Among them was Ed Prout, who brought his A/Altered from Connecticut. Yet by 1977, they had begun to be supplanted by Funny Car and Pro Stock.Thacker, Tony. \\"Rat Trap – 50 Years of Craziness\\", written 2 December 2016, at Goodguys.com (retrieved 19 June 2017) As late as that, however, John Lingenfelter was racing a B/Econo Altered (rebodied from Bob Glidden's 1976 Pro Stock car) in Comp Eliminator. Despite the popularity of Altereds, NHRA stopped having an Altered Eliminator category in 1972, and eventually moved them into the NHRA's Competition Eliminator. There are over 40 classes of Altereds and Street Rods today, all based on vehicle and engines. Altereds may start as sub-2000cc 4-cylinder engines (AA or BB/AF and H/EA). A Formula Ford Kent engine can be used. A number of altereds drivers retired when NHRA banned the class, while others, like Geisler, moved to Funny Car.

It was established from 1882. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 December 2004.  History  'Vineyard Haven' was selected by Frenchman Phillipe Palis, who entered into a Conditional Purchase agreement (CP82/650) on 26 October 1882, and the property was surveyed on 14 March 1883. The survey plan was accepted on 11 August 1883, and the parcel of land containing 32.37 hectares was designated Parish Portion 36. Palis and his brother built a wattle & daub hut, and a blacksmith shop in which he made tools for his own use and for sale to the Italian settlers. He also planted vineyards and extensively trenched the land and dug dams and wells to irrigate the vines. Palis lived on the property with his brother for many years. There has been suggestion that Palis acted as an interpreter for settlers on several occasions. There is also suggestion that he acted as local school teacher. Believed to be highly educated, it is most likely that this was an unofficial role prior to construction of a formal local school and appointment of a teacher. Palis' friend, Frenchman Monsieur Jean Le Cheminant was appointed the first school teacher at New Italy in 1885. The Conditional Purchase was never completed, and on the 17 August 1904 the property was transferred to an Italian settler named Giovanni Guarischi (spelt as Guariski on the plan for Parish Portion 36). Members of the family lived on the property until at least the mid 1920s. Giovanni died in 1937 and his wife Angelina in 1949, and both are buried at Woodburn Cemetery. The block was then frequently resold to local people who occasionally used it for grazing cattle, but much forest regrowth also occurred. A small number of the original old-growth trees remain in 2004. The property was purchased in late 1971 by Arnold and Mary Vayo after they migrated to Australia with their five children Craig, Alison, Bradford, Bruce and Russell, to start a new life, reflecting the migration of the Italian settlers nearly 90 years earlier. The property was re-surveyed in 1993, and a small part (4 hectares) of the adjacent Parish Portion 67, which contained many old growth trees, was added to the \\"Vineyard Haven\\" property. In 1999 the Vayos entered into a Voluntary Conservation Agreement with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to allow as much as possible of the property to return to its forested state. The Vayo family have lived permanently on the property since 1993, and have sought listing on the State Heritage Register to enhance their ongoing protection of the surviving evidence of Italian settlement on the property.  Description  This property is situated on the corner of Swan Bay-New Italy Road, and Forest Road. A creek bed traversing approximately the middle of \\"Vineyard Haven\\" in a north–south direction was the original track that the settlers used from Swan Bay to Chatswood Island, part of which was used as the track from Swan Bay to New Italy. The present Forest Road soon became the southbound road. The main route south was then quickly relocated two kilometres east of the settlement and was known as Lawrence Road for many years, and now forms part of the Pacific Highway.\` Much of the area has regrown since the Italian Settlement days and it seems possible that today's view of the landscape and setting at Vineyard Haven is much as the first settlers saw it in 1882. The bushland is termed \\"dry to moist sclerophyll and swamp sclerophyll forest\\" and contains a broad variety of trees including (using common names) many Eucalyptus and other hardwoods such as swamp mahogany, red and pink bloodwood, spotted gum, scribbly, tallow wood, grey gum, stringy bark, iron bark, red ash, and non-eucalyptus such as rough barked apple, paper barks, forest she-oak, banksia and wattle. These trees provided the early settlers with many options and uses. There are significant rainforest elements re-emerging throughout the property. There were about 50 adult men initially amongst the first settlers and although they undertook much of the hard physical work of clearing the land, ring barking (see photo 11) and felling trees, grubbing out roots, axing and adzing the straight timbers for building purposes, the women of the settlement also took part in the hard work of land clearing. The men also walked some 10-15 kilometres to work on the sugar plantations, often staying a whole week and returning home on weekends to continue working on their blocks. Examples of ringbarked, but unfallen trees, remain standing today, over 120 years later. Isolated original posts and well linings in timber slabs also remain as products of the tree felling. The soil was generally heavy clay and needed hard work. However other soils such as sandstone, ironstone and gravel were also to be found on the property and used to line wells and make roads. Soon after settlement the area was subject to many wet years followed by severe dry periods. Between 1900 and 1920 the major and record drought (1915) were punctuated by significant floods. Water reticulation and retention would have been important then, and this site of the original Palis Brothers block (now 'Vineyard Haven') was then described as well trenched. They used these trenches to direct rain water to the Grave Vines, Garden, Holding Tank and the Dam in the creek bed. Plan No. 1 indicates the location of what are probably the most significant archaeological and historic remains visible on the site today. The items are generally close by the residence of the Vayos, and are as follows: 1.and 8. Grape Vines: There are two of these on the property, north east and east of the existing Vayo residence. They are set on sloping land that still bears the marks of vineyard contours. The vines do not seem to have old stems but rather have grown from old roots. Trellises have been set up to support them. Old contours are still visible from aerial mapping on this and adjacent properties. The grapes themselves are a tough skinned small dark red grape, \\"Lady Isabella\\" in style which is a grape favoured by Italian vintners. 2\\\\. An open log trough structure, partially intact, lies close by the mud hut mound . 3\\\\. A pronounced mound of debris and earth, believed to be the site of the original hut, was described by an early visitor to the site in the 1880s as having a wattle and daub hut and blacksmiths shop. There are also 4 square chains of well trenched land planted with grape vines. The Palis Brothers were described as being articulate and intelligent. An original timber peg, used by the settlers, still lies on top of the mound (in 2004). 4\\\\. Timber lined well, called by the settlers a \\"holding tank\\", approx 2.4 metres deep, with timber linings using both tall vertical and horizontal slabs in a systematic way, and which currently has a timber platform (in need of repair in 2004) above it supporting a hand pump erected by the Vayos in 1993. This rainwater holding well/tank provided the domestic water for the early settlers, and was fed by the trenching system across the land. 5\\\\. A shallow depression, where the Vayos have a display of some vintage weather recording devices and Stevenson's Screen, was associated with the original hut site adjacent, most likely as a storage and wine making area. Excavation of soil that formed the depression may have been used as a source of material for the wattle and daub hut. 6\\\\. A bare earth circle that may be the site of the early blacksmiths shop. Metal detection has indicated metal remnants. 7\\\\. Water trenches. As noted in item 3 above, this land was described as 4 square chains of well trenched land and there are many indications of this trenching over the site. 8\\\\. Contours of old grape vines: the land slopes down away from the house. It is possible to read the landscape of this slope as the contours of the original vine rows. 9\\\\. Hand-dug dam. This dam is about 50–75 metres south east of the mud hut mound, in an intermittent creek gully, and measures about 8 metres x 5 metres, with about 3 metres in depth. It was located in 1973 by the Vayos under a covering of soft earth and leaf litter, and the bottom is lined with bricks. Some water diversion around the dam is needed, at least until an archaeological study can be made of the dam structure and function. The owner has attempted to direct water around the dam so that in the future an archaeological study may be facilitated to determine the structure and function of the dam. = Condition = The physical condition of the relics was reported to be good as at 13 July 2004. The archaeological resources are substantially intact.  Heritage listing  'Vineyard Haven' occupies the property originally taken up by the French Palis Brothers, and then the Italian Giovanni Guarischi, and contributes to the state significant New Italy Settlement Landscape. The whole landscape is of state significance as evidence of a settlement built through the tenacity, forbearance and technical skills of a unique group of Australian settlers. It contains remnants of the landscape encountered by the settlers and evidence of their domestic and work practices. These relics and archaeological items include a dam site, a timber lined well, a mound, vines, vine contours on the landscape, former water trenches and other archaeological evidence. The present owners, the Vayo family, have owned the site for over 30 years and have conserved this significant evidence of 19th century settlement. The site's context is also important. According to early portion plans an early (and possibly first) track from Chatsworth Road to Swan Bay traversed Vineyard Haven passing through portion 36 and northward through portions 35, 29 and 26 near the New Italy site, and on towards Swan Bay. It is suggested that the portion of this track between Swan Bay and New Italy, and Vineyard Haven to the south, is closely aligned to the track used by the early settlers when travelling from Swan Bay and Woodburn to Vineyard Haven to make their land selections and build their houses. It also shares or is close to the South Woodburn- Chatsworth Island coach route which had been established since the mid 1870s. The gateway to property of Vineyard Haven is opposite the site of the Italian Settlers Saint Peter's Church which was erected in 1907 after an earlier church was destroyed by a fire. This church was demolished in 1945 after being damaged by a Storm. Another important aspect of the context is the bushland setting, much of which has regrown on Vineyard Haven and which is reminiscent of the setting and circumstances that would have faced the first Italian and French Settlers when they arrived in 1882. A very varied and mixed hardwood forest containing a \\"dry to moist sclerophyll and swamp sclerophyll forest\\" and which provides a direct link with the setting of the past and evidence of the settler's original efforts at clearing the land.Hickson 2003 and Vayo 2004 Vineyard Haven, New Italy Settlement was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Vineyard Haven is if state significance as one of the original New Italy properties selected in 1882, still retaining evidence of vineyards and domestic structures supporting settlement, and as a contributory element to the historic landscapes of New Italy. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Vineyard Haven is significant for its associations with the French Palis Brothers who acted as teachers and interpreters for the New Italy settlers, with the Italian Guarischi family who owned and occupied the land from the late 19th to the early 20th centuries, a then with various owners who used the site for grazing until purchased by Arnold and Mary Vayo who have conserved the site for present and future generations. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Vineyard Haven is significant for the aesthetic qualities of its old growth and regrowth schlerophyll forest in a gently undulating landscape providing a setting for the homestead area and clearings used for vine cultivation along the routes that have connected New Italy to the outside world at Swan Bay; and for the technical innovation of the Italian settlers in constructing dams and watering systems for their vines that may reflect similar practises in northern Italy. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Vineyard Haven is of state significance as a reference site, in its archaeological resources, for the cultivation of vineyards by Italian settlers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and for its potential to yield further information on the development of vine growing in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Vineyard Haven may be representative in its archaeological resources and historical uses of the principal characteristics of many of the blocks settled at New Italy, although further research on other sites in New Italy is needed to confirm this.

Life In 1875 Graf purchased the original Compania Cervecera Toluca y Mexico, a small producer of cerveza sencilla, a form of light ale, from fellow Swiss Ausgustin Marendazand and began brewing a popular amber ale which is often cited as the first commercially successful beer brewed in the southwestH.M. Broderick(ed.) The Practical Brewer, MBAA, 1977. The problems with temperature control during wort production and fermentation in Mexico's hot climate forced him to continue brewing ale until the opening of an international railroad link with the United States enabled him to import the first large ice producing absorption machines from Germany in 1882. With better equipment and the ability to cool wort and fermenter's properly, Graf was the first to successfully brew lager in Mexico. In 1890, Graf formed a stock company and erected the first large, modern lager brewery in Mexico. Graf brewed various types of light colored ambers but seemed uninterested in pale beers like the popular Pilsener style.Vienna, Marzen, Oktoberfest, by George and Laurie Fix, 1991, Disappointed with the quality of malt and hops available locally, he imported all his hops from Europe and most of his malt from the United States. In addition, he set up his own malting facilities in Mexico, using barley imported from the United StatesThe Two Republics, June 30, 1897. Graf was able to increase the acidity of his mash by increasing the percentage of dark malts in his recipesPrinciples of Brewing Science, George Fix, 1989, The Association of Brewers thereby counteracting the high alkalinity of brewing water available in Mexico, with the alkalinity simultaneously mellowing the acidic flavors of the dark malts in the final product.

It was designed by the NSW Colonial Architect's Office and built from 1879. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived, however this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opening as settlement spread. The advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW from the 1860s. Also, in 1863, the Postmaster General W. H. Christie noted that accommodation facilities for Postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period were designed in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the 1890s Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who retained office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for Post, Telegraph and Telephone Offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for Post Office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975 the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Postal and Telecommunications Department, with Telecom and Australia Post being created. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, which heralded a new direction in property management, including a move towards smaller shop-front style post offices away from the larger more traditional buildings. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services, including mail distribution, as agencies for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = Casino Post Office = The first European settlers in the Casino district were cedar- getters, who had moved into the area in , ten years after its exploration in the late 1820s. Pastoralists soon followed, with George Stapleton and Henry Clay claiming land for the first station on what was to become the town of Casino. They named their 30,000 acre station \\"Cassino\\", apparently after Mount Cassino in Italy. Part of their property included an easy crossing point on the Richmond River and it was around this that the first small settlement appeared. Originally named The Falls, it was surveyed and renamed Casino in 1855 with land going on sale in 1856. By this time a weekly mail service was already operating from Sydney with the post being collected out of a store in town. The settlement also had a police station, court house, school and race course. By the late 1850s Casino had developed as the centre of settlement in the upper Richmond River district. The first official postmaster, William M. Scott, was appointed in the town in with the Post and Telegraph Office operating from the Tomki Shire Offices. In 1879 a new Post Office building was started in Casino, with Postmaster Scott moving into the residence on 21 March 1880. The new office was a single-storey building with an office, four rooms, kitchen and stable. In 1881 permission was obtained to construct an underground water-storage tank and a boundary fence. The ground in the front of the office was also levelled during this period. In 1883, the Casino office was staffed by Mr Scott as postmaster, his wife as an assistant, a junior telegraph operator, a letter carrier and a messenger. Mail was delivered from Sydney twice a week via coach from Ballina. In 1889 extensions to the Post Office were approved with the Office being extended to the street frontage and an extra room being added. In 1893, to prevent rain from wetting the private mail boxes and the mailing slot, a portico was added to the front of the building, with a bathroom being added at the same time. In 1894 the first telephone in Casino was installed in the office. Early in 1915 plans were approved for further alterations. The works included the partial re-erection of the existing building, the addition of an extra floor containing residential quarters, and the rearrangement of the office on the first floor. These were completed by late 1915. Andrew Ward & Associates and Clive Lucas Stapleton and Associates, 2000  Description  The two-storey, combined Post Office and residence is constructed of double brick with the symmetrical ground-floor front facade rendered as ashlar blockwork. The eastern wall to the ground floor is cream-painted English bond brickwork. The upper floor, a later addition, is constructed of stretcher bond, face sandstock brickwork. Casino Post Office is an eclectic mix of architectural styles. The main body of the building is in the Victorian Italianate style, with apricot painted ashlar render, arched windows and pilaster details. First completed in 1879, it has s extensions to the rear, along the western boundary in stretcher bond, face, reddish-brown brickwork and has a predominantly hipped, corrugated steel roof with a gable at the northern end. There is a later addition along the western wall with the extension of private post office boxes comprising a covered, raised verandah with attached ramp to the footpath, beneath the widened eaves of the s extensions to the rear. This extension has a round head picket fence along the boundary and is supported by plain, squared timber posts. Post boxes are located on each wall of the southwest corner, the southern section of wall being set back from the original wall boundary, forming a recessed arcade. Later steps have been installed to each section of boxes. The ground-floor front facade has a visually heavy, full-length, single-storey classically-arranged portico in the Georgian Revival Style, added between 1889 and 1893. It is supported by paired, rendered and painted Ionic-styled columns, with a squared column at each front corner. They rest on s burnt red, clay-tiled, terraced portico floor and steps, and support a plain, banded entablature and balustraded parapet, which conceals a shallow, hipped, corrugated steel roof. The deep portico retains a white-painted timber boarded and shaped batten soffit, with later pendant lighting installed, and a recent steel balustrade to the disabled retail entry terrace leading around from the western ramp. The ground-floor rear addition of the residence to the eastern side is a combination of face and cream-painted brickwork, with a weatherboard and asbestos cement-sheet laundry and bathroom addition to the northern end. There is a timber porch to the eastern wall, with a corrugated steel roof and timber boarded soffit, supported on squared timber posts and with a cream-painted, timber-slatted balustrade, unpainted timber floorboards and slate on rendered brick steps. This forms the main ground-floor entry to the residence hallway. The upper-floor residence, added , is centered over the ground-floor building and portico and has a balcony to the front facade. The balcony comprises a corrugated steel skillion roof and has the same fabric and detailing as the ground-floor eastern porch, with the addition of a flagpole protruding from the centre of the balcony. The remainder of the upper floor has a gabled hip roof with east and west vent gables. Three face brick chimneys with terracotta pots punctuate the upper-floor roof, and two painted chimneys punctuate the rear additions to the ground-floor section of the residence. Fenestration is largely symmetrical to the front facade, and the openings of the ground-floor front facade retain original elliptical fanlights with rendered mouldings and keystones. The ground-floor projecting sills are painted a tan colour to match the column capitals and bases, and the window elements are painted dark green. The upper-floor French doors and windows to the front facade are also symmetrical and original, excepting the more recent, outer screen doors. Windows to the east and west facades appear largely original to the ground and upper floors, being predominantly six pane upper and lower timber sash windows with mainly clear glazing. The ground-floor retail entry door is a later addition, as are some later doors and windows to the later rear ground-floor additions and alterations. The Post Office interior is made up of three main sections, the carpeted front retail area, the vinyl floored mail sorting and storage area to the western side and staff facilities to the rear. The interior walls to the ground-floor Post Office comprise rendered and painted double brickwork, fibre cement sheeting and timber and glass partitions. The retail area layout and finishes are modern in the standard Australia Post retail fitout in a predominantly grey colour scheme, comprising display wall panelling, laminated shelving and counter. The offices, sorting and storage areas have a predominantly light green and cream colour scheme and have a complete modern fitout, including doors, with the later additions. Original and early architraves have been retained in good condition. Ceiling height varies at ground-floor level with the installation of air-conditioning ducting and services, and fabric includes plasterboard with scotia moulded cornices and square set acoustic tile to the retail area. The Post Office areas have banks of suspended and flush fluorescent lighting. Large areas of original wall fabric appear to have been removed as a result of the additions and some original and early windows have been modified with the changes in use, especially concerning current wet areas. Air conditioning ducting is visible as an intrusion in the southern end post box areas. Any original features such as fireplaces have been removed at the ground-floor Post Office level, however a chimney breast corresponding with a chimney above is retained to the retail area, though completely obscured. The residence comprises the eastern section of the ground floor to the rear, and the upper floor. The ground-floor concrete-floor laundry and tiled bathroom is a later skillion addition with asbestos cement sheeting and raked timber boarded ceiling. The rest of the ground-floor and upper-floor walls are of plastered and painted double brick, excepting the upper-floor bathroom and store to the northeastern corner, containing asbestos cement sheeting and timber board lining. The ceiling to the ground floor is plaster and batten in the vinyl- tiled kitchen, with a scotia cornice, flush plaster with wide moulded cornice to the lounge room and v-joint timber boards to the main hallway and stair soffit. The upper-floor ceiling is completely v-joint timber boarded with a narrow ovolo cornice. Lighting to the upper floor is largely later pendants, and ceiling fans have been installed to the bedrooms and to the lounge and kitchen below. The carpeted residence appears to retain its original spatial configuration of four upper-floor bedrooms and hall, lounge and services to the ground floor, excepting the later, tiled bathroom, wc and store addition and fitout. Original features retained include skirtings, picture rails, architraves, wall vents and face-brick fireplaces. The face-brick fireplaces have corbelled-brick brackets, timber mantle and cast iron grates to the lounge room and southwestern bedroom. There is a painted cast-iron Victorian fireplace to the northwestern bedroom on the upper floor with timber surround. The kitchen retains its original hearth with a timber-bracketed mantle over and early combustion stove, a \\"Canberra by Metters\\". The central stair of the residence is original with turned timber posts, with a squared body and squared timber balusters. Floor-to-ceiling height timber panelling in excellent condition beneath the second flight, conceals under-floor storage and passage to a rear door and the verandah. The rear L-shaped verandah provides shelter to the rear ground-floor walls and access points. The Casino Post Office and postcode signage is located across the centre of the entablature in simple lettering and there is a standard illuminated Australia Post sign freestanding to the eastern side at the footpath edge. A bank of public telephones is located against the western wall of the adjacent building to the east of the post office. A cyclone wire fence and high security gates enclose the rear of Casino Post Office. There is a s brick motorcycle shed is to the north in the concreted rear yard, with an adjacent timber shed to the grassed rear yard of the residence. The rear yard of the residence is separated from the Post Office yard by another high cyclone mesh fence. There is a steel framed and clad carport to the eastern side of the building adjacent to the residence. To the north of the Post Office site is Telstra property, containing a large, intrusive telecommunications tower that dominates the roofscape of the civic centre of Casino. To the west of the building is the former CBC Bank, separated by a laneway to the rear yard. Prominent street lighting is well spaced to the side at the front of the post office. The vegetation of the rear yard to the residence comprises garden beds of dense trees and shrubs, individual large trees, and to the front of the post office, isolated palm trees located at the footpath's edge. The building was reported to be in good physical condition as at 22 June 2000, with medium archaeological potential. Casino Post Office is substantially intact since the alterations and additions made in 1915, and retains the features which make it culturally significant including architectural features such as the classical porch, Ionic columns and overall scale, form and style. = Modifications and dates = The original building was completed in 1879, comprising four rooms, office, kitchen and stable. The extension of the building to the street frontage, the erection of the classical portico and the addition of bathroom were requested and completed between 1889-1893. The upper storey was completed . In around 1976, the later additions to the ground-floor Post Office sorting and storage area along the western boundary, new letter boxes and motorcycle shed appear to have been constructed. Later alterations include the standard Australia Post fitout to the retail area of the mid-1990s.

It is distinguished from parasitism in fiction, a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the parasite inflicts harm on its host. Relationships Relationships between species in early science fiction were often imaginatively parasitic, with the parasites draining the vital energy of their human hosts and taking over their minds, as in Arthur Conan Doyle's 1895 The Parasite. After the Second World War, science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in Ted White's 1970 By Furies Possessed; Brian Stableford argues that White was consciously opposing the xenophobia of Robert Heinlein's 1951 The Puppet Masters which involved a parasitic relationship close to demonic possession, with a more positive attitude towards aliens. Stableford notes, however, that Octavia Butler's 1984 Clay's Ark and other of her works such as Fledgling, and Dan Simmons's 1989 Hyperion take an ambivalent position, in which the aliens may confer powers such as Hyperion's ability to regenerate continually—but at a price, in its case an incremental loss of intelligence at each regeneration. In Star Trek, the Trill were a race of humanoids who incorporated a long- living symbiont. One of them was a main character on the series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. In the series Stargate SG-1, both the principal villains, the Goa'uld and their benevolent versions, the Tok'ra were symbionts who grafted themselves into the human nervous system.

The attacks were committed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and largely targeted Syria's Druze minority. Attacks The attackers began by assaulting defensive positions in the city. When they depleted their ammunition, they detonated their explosive vests. The Syrian Arab News Agency reported two separate suicide attacks in Suweida, with security forces killing two other attackers before they could blow themselves up, and arresting another inside Suwaida General Hospital. Groups of militants also attacked areas in the Al-Mushannaf nahiyah in a coordinated assault and four villages ( Al-Sbeky , Ramy , Ghethet-Hamael and Tarbeh ), gaining temporary control of several settlements, slaughtered families in their houses and seizing hostages. Local people gathered and defended their villages with simple weapons and retook the villages without support of governmental forces . A substantial number of Druze militias were involved in driving the ISIL forces back, most notably the Rijal al-Karama movement and the Mountain Brigade, one of whose sub-commanders (Sheikh Abu Mu'annis Nabil Saymu'a) was killed in course of the fighting. The Christian SSNP also aided the local pro-government defenders, while the Syrian Army only arrived in the area after the combat had already ended two days later. A suicide bombing in a vegetable market in the capital of the province, Al Suwayda, resulted in at least 38 casualties.https://aoav.org.uk/2018/suicide- bomber-kills-at-least-38-in-syria-city-of-sweida/ Following the attack, three captured ISIL fighters were publicly hanged by the angry local Druze people in the provincial capital.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-executes- captured-syrian-soldiers-after-devastating-terrorist-attack-in-sweida/ Casualties Initially, the head of the Sweida health authority told the pro-Damascus Sham FM radio some 96 people were killed and 176 wounded in total.

On the 31st of July 2018, in exchange for the release of the Druze women captured by ISIL in the raid in eastern Suweida, the Syrian Army evacuated hundreds of ISIL fighters from the Yarmouk basin in western Daraa to their strongholds in the Badiya region in eastern Syria Desert.https://syria.liveuamap.icom/en/2018/31-july-multiple-sources-and- witnesses-reporting-100s-ofhttps://www.almasdarnews.com/article/defeated-isis- in-yarmouk-basin-evacuated-to-syrian-desert-photos/ Many Druze people were very angry with the Syrian Military because of the incompetent security measures in Suwayda province, accusing the Syrian Government of deliberately allowing the attacks so that they can have a casus belli to reimpose stricter government control over the Suwayda province and end the Druze autonomy, especially because the attack was made by ISIL fighters evacuated from Southern Damascus to Eastern Syria Desert in May 2018. Afterwards, the Syrian government offered a deal to ISIL, that the 30+ captured Druze civilians will be swapped in the prisoner exchange for over 200 ISIL fighters of Jaysh Khaled bin Walid who surrendered in southwestern Daraa on 31 July 2018, however ISIL forces in Badiya region refused the prisoner exchange, and instead requested a large sum of ransom money for the release of the captured Druze civilians, which the Syrian army refused to pay.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-military-to-isis-release- sweida-prisoners-or-we-will-destroy-you/ In order to pressure the Syrian government to pay the ransom, ISIL executed one of the male Druze civilians captured in the raid on August 2, and posted the video of his execution on the internet.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-releases-footage- of-19-year-old-student-executed-in-al- sweida/https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/isis-executes-first-hostage-from- al-sweida/ In response, the Syrian army threatened ISIL forces in Badiya region that if they did not release the captives, that they would be destroyed in the upcoming military operation in Badiya al Sham region.https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-armys-elite-unit-heads-to- sweida-to-finish-off-isis/ It was reported from local residents that the defense forces belonging to Al-Baath Party removed its defensive medium-sized weapons four days before the attack despite knowing the imminent threats.

Biography Lerma studied biology at the Complutense University of Madrid, and in 1979 started research at the Hospital Ramón y Cajal, under the mentorship of Elio Garcia-Austt, obtaining his PhD in sciences at the Autonomous University of Madrid in 1983. After six years as a faculty member at the hospital's Department of Research, he became a tenured staff researcher in the Instituto Cajal supported by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas. In 1987, he moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine as a Fogarty Fellow, working with Mike V. L. Bennett and R. Suzanne Zukin. In 1990, he returned to Spain at the Instituto Cajal where he established his own lab. In 2000, he was promoted to full professor. In 2004, he moved to the Instituto de Neurociencias (Neurosciences Institute) in Alicante. He became vice-director (2005-2007) and director (2007-2016). Research Lerma has focused his research on the molecular basis of neuronal communication, specifically on elucidating the properties and signaling mechanisms of glutamate receptors. He described the existence of functional kainate receptors (KARs) in central neurons and applied single-cell RT-PCR to study neurotransmitter receptors. He described the KAR's fundamental role in controlling neuronal tissue excitability and epileptogenesis, demonstrating that KARs have a dual mechanism of signaling. He studied the role played by KARs at particular synapses and in the pathophysiology of brain diseases, in particular those related to mood disorders.

The fable A man and a lion dispute which of them is the superior. The man points to a statue of a lion being subdued by a man as his evidence. In the Greek version, the lion retorts that if lions could sculpt, they would show themselves as the victors, drawing the moral that honesty outweighs boasting.Aphthonius, fable 34 In other versions, the lion asks who made the statue and refuses to take it as evidence on learning that it was a man.

The historic nature of the New Italy settlement in the Richmond Valley Council in New South Wales, Australia, has been recognised with the listing of much of the settlement on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 August 2002.  History  Map of the Richmond River District, showing the location of New Italy, published 1889 The New Italy settlement covers an area of and represents an unusual phase of settlement in New South Wales. It is the only known settlement of its type in New South Wales. On 7 April 1881, 217 Italians arrived in Sydney. They had sailed from Venice, Italy for New Ireland, north east of New Guinea, to set up a new colony. The expedition had been organised by the Marquis de Ray Charles Marie du Breil, a young Frenchman of noble descent who was unhappy with the changes that the French Revolution had made to his position. In 1879 he announced that a colony would be established to the north east of Australia, namely East New Guinea, New Britain and New Ireland to be known as La Nouvelle France, or Port Breton. Word of the venture spread to North Italy, de Rays having placed an agent to sell the venture in Milan. To those living close to starvation and seeing only a grim future for their children in a climate of economic, social and political hardship, this venture was the opportunity for a new life. Despite a decree by the French government forbidding emigration agencies to recruitm for the venture and the Royal Investigation Bureau in Milan issuing a direction that no passport be issued to any Italian planning to participate in the scheme fifty families were determined to try their luck and Italians had begun arriving in Barcelona, the point of departure, in April 1880. Their voyage is now known as the De Rays Expedition. By 8 July 1880, everyone had boarded the ship India which left the following day loaded with goods thought useful and necessary were abroad. The passengers were essentially paying immigrants who had either paid in francs or who had agreed to work for the administrators of the new colony for five years before qualifying to own their own house and land. The journey was difficult and the immigrants on arrival at Port Breton found not a settlement, but a harsh land where no improvements had been undertaken. Initial attempts were made to establish a colony. The \\"Genil\\", which had left for Port Breton prior to the \\"India\\" with supplies and Spanish soldiers, many of whom had deserted before it reached its destination, left for Sydney for supplies in mid December. By the end of February 1881 those Italians still alive were on their way to Noumea in New Caledonia despite having requested transport to Sydney. The \\"India\\" barely made it to Noumea. The colonial administration and public were sympathetic and generous offering shelter, rations and gifts. However, the Italians refused to leave the ship, determined to go to Sydney. A deputation approached the British Consul who forwarded the immigrant's request to come to Sydney to Sir Henry Parkes, then Colonial Secretary of NSW and the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Loftus. There was no hesitation by Parkes to bring the immigrants to Australia as shipwrecked mariners but he was undecided whether they could stay as he feared their destitution would leave them without means of subsistence. An inquiry after they arrived in Sydney noted the immigrants were mainly agriculturally skilled with particular knowledge of vines and olives but had no money or knowledge of trades. The French administration advanced the funds necessary to allow the Australasian Steam Navigation Company ship the \\"James Patterson\\" to transport the people and in return the \\"India\\" and her cargo were sold. The remaining 217 Italian immigrants left Noumea on 2 April and arrived in Sydney on 7 April. The government, press, public and Sydney Italian community took great interest in the new arrivals and gave all the assistance possible. On 20 April Parkes announced that the Italians could stay. However, they were not to settle together but be dispersed throughout the colony to learn the language, find work and attempt to make a life for themselves. The Italians, having been through so much together, were reluctant to part ways and did so only through the persuasion of the Italian Consul General. In the coming months they made the most of their new life and King Umberto I of Italy conferred honours on the men who had helped the Italians throughout the ordeal. Parkes was made Commander of the Crown of Italy. The desire to be together however, remained. In early 1882 Rocco Caminotti, a man of Italian origin, met some of the settlers from the de Ray expedition. He knew of their desire to remain together and while in Northern NSW noticed that there was land still being offered and believed it a place that may allow the new settlers to live in close proximity. He and Antonio Pezzutti investigated the region in April and applied for a selection close to a creek on the South Woodburn - Chatsworth island coach route. This was at the junction of the main road between the Clarence River and Richmond River and of the road to Swan Bay. This would form the nucleus of the New Italy settlement. The first seven families came to New Italy in 1882 and were followed by 19 in 1883. The men, women and children set about creating a new community. The earliest arrivals lived at Swan Bay travelling every day on foot to their selections to build homes. The first child was born at the settlement on 29 July 1882 to Angela Pezzutti. The houses were built of materials available on and around their selections including clay, bark or wattle and daub. Later homes were built with chamferboard and trees felled from the selections. Wells were dug 2.43 to 3.65 metres (8 to 12 feet) deep as there was no natural water source, ovens were built close to homes and later cellars to store the wine the settlement produced. Men felled trees and cleared land while the women dug trenches for drainage. The inhabitants made their own baskets and chairs and utilised whatever resources they could. They called the settlement La Cella Venezia, the Venetian Cell, as a symbol of their closeness. A travelling correspondent for the Sydney newspaper Tribune visited the settlement and found hospitable, amiable and interesting people growing fruits and vegetables including grape vines, melons, lemons and pumpkin. Among the families were the Caminottis, Pezzuttis, Nardis as well as the Pallis, French brothers who had joined the Italians. The new arrivals continued to work their land and planted peach, apple and loquat trees, corn and more vines. They acquired pigs, cows, poultry and sheep. In 1889 Frank Clifford wrote of the success of the settlement, suggesting similar colonies be established in New South Wales. Frank Treatt visited the settlement in 1899 having encountered the families as an immigration agent in 1881. He found the people content, at the beginning of prosperity and held in high esteem throughout the district. The settlers funded their achievements by taking work in the district, particularly in the sugar cane fields and mill and were known as reliable, hard workers. They made and sold wine and the fruits and vegetables they grew. They also sold the timber from the trees they felled on their selections. Timber remained an important industry for around thirty years at New Italy. As the settlement developed the men were less willing to leave regularly for work. The poor soil quality and lack of water prevented them turning to full scale commercial production of fruit and vegetables. Instead they worked for a period while they saved money and then returned to the settlement until the money ran out again. They were often away for about six months of the year. Eager for the men to remain in the settlement permanently the settlers eagerly embraced the suggestion that they consider silk production (sericulture). Attempts had been made to cultivate the large numbers of naturally occurring mulberry trees for the use of silkworms for commercial silk production since the 1820s. In the 1880s Reginald Champ was the most active proponent of this. He approached Parkes in December 1888 and in mid-1889 suggesting the government give impetus to the establishment of a silk industry. Parkes sent him to New Italy too see if the settlers there were interested. It would not have been lost on Parkes that the silk industry was a traditional industry of Venetia and that the settlers had probably had some contact with it. It is very likely it was also a strategic political act, showing interest and providing opportunities in a region that had not been happy with the Sydney government. There were mulberry trees among the orchards at New Italy and the settlers had already shown interest and ability in utilising available resources. In 1890 the Inspector General of Forests J. E. Brown accompanied Champ to New Italy to give his opinion on the suitability of the site for intensive silk worm breeding. Champ and Brown both considered that New Italy was a suitable environmentally and labour wise. The settlers assured Parkes of their willingness and ability with a petition which was presented to him on behalf of the settlers by the Italian Consul-General. In March 1891 Champ went back to the settlement and activity clearing and felling trees, planting mulberry trees and silkworm breeding began with earnest. A year later progress was impressive and the industry showing every sign of success. However, in mid-1891 the Parkes ministry was overturned and government interest and participation in the enterprise decreased. A request for government purchase of a reeling machine for the settlement met no response. Once again, showing their resourcefulness and tenacity, the settlers came up with their own solution. Pezzutti and Martinuzzi devised and built a machine instead which brought much praise from J. S. Campbell, Director of Agriculture when he visited the settlement in November 1892. He was impressed by the expertise and enthusiasm in the settlement and the district and recommended government assistance building a filature where silk reeling could be more professionally carried out. Unfortunately 1893 saw changing fortunes in NSW generally with the onset of depression. Fire also caused much damage at the settlement, ending silk production as a large scale government sponsored industry. Small production did continue and silk was sent to the Dibbs government in 1893. This silk won a gold medal at the Great Exhibition in Chicago and the skeins then sent to Queen Victoria. Giacomo Piccoli won first prize for his silk at the Sydney Exhibition in 1899 and Milan in 1906. The Governor of NSW Sir Earl Beauchamp visited New Italy in 1900 and praised Piccolli's silk and skills. The settler's success, hard work and thrift allowed them to recover after the fire. Some rented nearby dairy farms and others bought the selections of these people and increased their stock numbers. Dairying, timbergetting, winemaking and canecutting provided many opportunities. Whilst establishment of industry was going on the education needs of the children and the spiritual needs of the community were not forgotten. A local priest recommended a school be made available under the Public Instruction Act aimed at giving equal opportunity in access to education. The Woodburn School committee assisted the settlers in drafting a request for a schoolteacher. At this time the official name of New Italy was chosen rather than the Italian name, the first suggestion of integration with the wider Australian community. On 9 September 1885 the school had its first teacher and fifteen children. Many children only went to school for a few years but there were always children to go to school. The first teacher was French but spoke Italian. The second teacher, Thomas Morgan, who took over in 1890, considered it a responsibility to teach the children English so they could participate in English speaking society. He forbade Italian in the classroom. He stayed for 13 years and during this time the school was enlarged twice. In 1896 a pupil teacher was appointed to assist him. Introduction of a school was not without its problems. The Public Instruction Act made it compulsory for school attendance which decreased the available labour at settlement, forcing some families to move away as they could not survive without this help. In 1887 a church was built on land donated by Antonio Nardi and services were held once a month. Prior to this a priest had visited periodically. It was in the context of church that significant social activity took place. After the service most retired to the Nardi's for the afternoon, to eat, relax, socialise, play games and take a break from the hard work of the week. Of those who stayed many married others within the settlement reinforcing the bonds of the families who had arrived in 1881 although there were also many Italian newcomers. The Antonioli's, Bazzo's, Bertoli's, Buoro's, Capelin's, Gava's Mellare's, Pellizer's, Pezzutti's, Roder's, Spinaze's, Ras' Rosolens, Tome's, Scarabelotti's, Morandini's and Picoli's were joined by the Fava's, Pedrini's and Serone's. Non-Italians also married into the settlement, becoming a part of the New Italy family. Louie Antonioli's wine shop was an attraction throughout the district on Saturday afternoons where there was singing and dancing on the lawns. In 1900 Giacomo Rosolen built a sawmill which handled timber for nearly 20 years. A New Italy Progress Association was formed in 1903 to discuss establishing a post office and look at naturalisation and the silk industry and other issues. A new church was built in 1907 despite a rapid decline in population between 1905 and 1910 as younger families moved away. Those left were often widowed or unmarried. In 1918 the timber industry folded at New Italy. During the 1920s the population further decreased and became less Italian in character. In 1931 the jubilee of the settlement was celebrated with descendants arriving to visit those left behind. They had become prosperous in their lives. The school closed in 1933. However a new tradition began at this time. In 1936 Giacomo Picoli established a Park of Peace on his property where a tree was planted every year on 7 April to celebrate the immigrant's arrival in Sydney. Younger members of the families assembled every year for the commemoration. The tradition continued throughout World War Two without the festivities. Trees were planted on other important occasions. In 1942 Picolo was the last surviving resident of New Italy. He remained there until his death in 1955. Between 1942 and 1955 the settlement slowly disintegrated. A cyclone severely damaged the church and its contents were distributed throughout the district. The school residence was removed from the settlement before being brought back and used as a home by a new resident in the 1970s. Today many of the houses and buildings have disintegrated though evidence of their existence can be found in the form of wells, footings, and other artefacts scattered throughout the settlement site. However, the spirit of the settlement lives on. Interest in New Italy was revived in the 1950s when a reporter from Ballina, Diana Mercer wrote about the settlement. The Richmond River Historical Society suggested preserving the old mud house there. This did not eventuate. However proposal for a memorial was accepted. Money was raised and on 8 April 1961 the Richmond River Historical Society erected a monument to commemorate the pride, courage and strength of the Italian settlers and their contribution to the community. Approximately 1500 people attended the function including the Consul General for Italy, several members of Parliament and local dignitaries. With the imminent arrival of the centenary of the immigrant's arrival in 1981 a committee was established to organise celebrations. In April 1980 the ABC filmed the New Italy story through enactments and interviews for its A Big Country series and large centenary celebrations were held at the Lismore showground in August. Again many dignitaries attended including the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, the Mayor of Lismore, the Italian Consul General and numerous members of Parliament and Ministers including the Commissioner for Community Delegations and Ethnic Affairs and the State Minister for Decentralisation and Development. Plans were made for a Museum and new Park of Peace adjacent to the monument. The land was purchased in 1983 and in 1984 the Italian Consul General Dr Alvise Memmo laid the first stone at the entrance of the proposed new Peace Park and planted a tree, continuing Picoli's tradition. In the same year Spencer Spinaze received a knighthood in the Order of Merit of the Italian republic in recognition of his contribution to commemorating the Italian settlers and generating the interest of descendants. The initial reason for the committee's work was to celebrate the centenary of the arrival and achievements of the settlers and their descendants in Australia but it was not until 1989 that the Bicentennial Museum, restaurant and mud brick house were opened, the key buildings in the New Italy complex. Again a long list of state and local dignitaries attended the function. In the same year Italian Government Officials from World Expo visited New Italy. In 1992 a sculpture \\"The Pioneer and his dog\\" by Carlo Jacuzzi was unveiled on the site by the Italian Consul-General. At this opening it was announced by Brian Pezzutti, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, that a $5000 grant had been made to the New Italy Committee to help complete a new complex to tell the story of 200 years of Italian immigration to Australia. This was opened in 1993, the building being the Italian pavilion from World Expo 88 in Brisbane, Queensland. It was opened by the Governor General of Australia, Bill Hayden. In the same year an Aboriginal Arts and Crafts centre was opened to the rear of the complex. A one-room besser block community hall was opened in 1996 and the complex received its first tourism award. The Museum won a Cultural Tourism Award for NSW in 1997. Trees have continued to be planted in the Peace Park of by various dignitaries and celebrations are held each year celebrating Italians in Australia including Australia day, and the anniversary of the Italian community's arrival. A special occasion was the presentation of the Medal 'Castellanetta della Repubblica Italiana by Italian Ambassador Dr Giovanni Castellaneta in October 1999 to Dr Floriana Volpata who had been the representative for the Italian Consul general on the North Coast for his services to the community. Volpata had been a major driving force behind the activity at the New Italy Complex and the artistic work in the Italian Pavilion, a complex which has come to represent not only old and new Italians in Australia and their achievements and accomplishments but also the joining together of the Italian and non-Italian community to recognise and commemorate those contributions and experiences.  New Italy Museum and Park of Peace  The New Italy Museum and Park of Peace site is located at the junction of the Pacific Highway and the Swan Bay - New Italy Road. A parking area runs along the highway. The first monument to the Italian pioneers is located in the open grounds nearest the road junction. It is an obelisk of concrete and Italian marble. A covered, above ground well is located nearby. The site contains a pavilion next to the Swan Bay - New Italy Road housing a display on 200 years of Italian Immigrants in Australia. Directly opposite is a mud brick display hall which houses a collection of artefacts relating to the New Italy families and a cafeteria. Grape vines grow on the outside of the building. A restaurant and bar is situated to the north west of the Pavilion. These three buildings form a courtyard which contains several copies of well known statuary as well as the pioneer and his dog monuments. Another hall can be found behind the restaurant. There is an Aboriginal gallery and craft site (currently unused?) on the site. In the north west corner of the site is the new park of Peace containing trees planted by various dignitaries commemorating significant events and celebrations. Items considered original fabric As the site contained Antoniolli's farm some items are considered to be fabric from this earlier settlement. A post and rail fence which separates the 1961 Memorial and well from the newer Museum complex buildings is considered to be made of original materials. However, there is no evidence to suggest it is in its original position. It is likely that the fence was erected in its current position after the Memorial was built. The adjacent well is also considered to be an original stone lined well (in situ), possibly similar to that on Roder's farm, but it has been capped, the sides extended above ground level and a roof built over the top. Archaeological studies would need to be undertaken to confirm how much of the original well still exists. ;1961 Memorial Monument Messes D.G. Board & Sons, Architects of Lismore, designed this obelisk type monument. The monument is concrete with white Italian marble plaques attached to each of the four sides of the obelisk. The story of New Italy is inscribed (in both English and Italian) on these plaques, as are the names of the original settlers. See photograph taken in 2001. It is reputedly located on the site of the former mud brick house. ;1989 Bicentennial Museum & Restaurant /Caretakers Residence These two mud brick buildings, designed by Ross McDonald and Associates were opened in 1989. The Museum building is a single story construction with mud brick walls, a tin roof supported by whole timbers and a cement floor. The building houses the museum and a cafe. A large verandah, which is now covered with grape vines, extends along the northern wall. This area is used by the cafe. On both the external and internal walls are paintings by Dr Floriano Volpato. These paintings depict scenes of Italy. Floriano also hand painted many of the signs around the complex including the panels that tell the story of the de Rays expedition and the immigrants eventual arrival in Sydney. The museum contains a wide selection of items from the New Italy Settlement including a desk from the school; alter rails from the church; numerous farming implements and household items such as a butter churn and a sewing machine. It also contains clothing and a fine petite point of Venice. Recently it has acquired a collection of telephone memorabilia used on the north coast of New South Wales. In 2001 the New Italy Museum Incorporated applied for a grant and acquired showcases to house photographs and pioneer family memorabilia. The Restaurant/Caretakers Residence is a two- story mud brick building designed to look like the original Antoniolli residence. The caretaker lives on the top floor and the bottom floor contains a restaurant, kitchen and toilets. This area is used on special occasions and is not necessarily open to the general public. ;1991 Father Miazzi's Monument Father Miazzi (a member of the Scalabrinian Order) was a much-loved priest in North Lismore and served many of the descendants of New Italy. He was killed in an air accident in 1968.The original monument to him had been placed at the Catholic Church, North Lismore but when the parish closed it was decided to move the monument to New Italy. See photograph. ;1992 Sculpture of the Pioneer and his Dog The Pioneer and his Dog sculpture, 2011 This sculpture sits at the entrance to the Plaza between the Museum and Italian Pavilion. It was designed and built by Carlo Jacuzzi and unveiled by the Italian Consul General Dr Fabio de Nardis. ;1992 Gurrigai Aboriginal Arts and Crafts Centre This building is of white besser block construction and is unlike most other buildings at the Complex, although built of similar materials to the nearby community Hall. It is a single storey building with one main exhibition area and a workroom behind. The managers of the centre exhibit and sell local indigenous art work, clothing and jewellery. ;1993 Italian Pavilion The Italian Pavilion is a reconstruction of the Italian Pavilion that stood at the Brisbane Exposition in 1988. The Italian Government donated the materials from the Italian Pavilion and New Italy Museum committee, under the leadership of Floriano Volpato, physically removed the Pavilion from Brisbane and re erected it at New Italy. The exhibits in this building are different from those in the Museum as it is aims to show 200 years of Italian immigration to Australia. Information sheets tell of the contribution of Italians who are now household names such as Carla Zampatti, Al Grasby and Franca Arena. This building contains paintings, produced by Floriano Volpato, information on the 20 Regions of Italy and a collection of photographs showing Italian migrants on the North Coast of New South Wales. The Pavilion also contains a number of Italianate sculptures. One is a bust of Floriano Volpato. The opening of the building was a Nationally significant event attended by the then Governor General Mr Bill Hayden. ;1996 Community Hall This besser brick building is really just one big room. It contains a stage at the southern end and glass windows that look over the Park of Peace. Located above the stage are heads representing figures at the Opera House in Milan that were acquired, along with the Italian Pavilion, from the Brisbane Expo, 1988. ;The Park of Peace This open area was dedicated in 1984 and since that time trees have been planted to commemorate either important occasions or people associated with the New Italy settlement or their descendants. Unfortunately the soil is poor in this area and most of the trees have not thrived. Species vary from Australian natives to Italian Deredales (check spelling). ;The (former New Italy) School Site The school site is located at the junction of the New Italy - Swan Bay Roads and Moonem Road. Planted hoop pines are located along the line of the roads. The School is a mostly overgrown paddock of which the southern and southeastern perimeter is lined by a number of very tall (c. 30 M) Araucaria cunninghammi (hoop pines) that were planted by students of the school in 1891. These trees are somewhat obscured by vigorous hardwood forest regrowth, and an understorey containing numerous self-seeded hoop pine trees. Other items of the fabric of the school which remains on the site include: footings for a tank stand underlying which is some brick rubble containing locally made bricks, a crepe myrtle tree, believed to have been positioned in front of one of the two buildings, two pits identified by Mr Mick Roselen, (a 92 year old descendant of the a first pioneer family who attended the school until he was 14 years old) as being associated with the school toilets, a number of post and rail fence elements and a modern sign declaring the area to be the site of the Historic New Italy School These sites are part of the much larger New Italy landscape which contain wells, fruit plantings and archaeological evidence of churches, domestic buildings and artifacts, shops and cellars.  Condition  The physical condition of the settlement was reported as fair to good as at 3 May 2002. The archaeological potential of the school site together with the surrounding New Italy landscape is high. The physical (archaeological) evidence of the sites is intact and can convey the significance of the site. Original plantings remain along with fences, wells and drainage lines, footings and rubbish dumps.  Timeline  * - teachers residence erected * - clearing of school playground * - pine trees acquired from scrub land on a nearby creek bank planted at school site * s/70s - school residence removed * 1984 - New Peace Park created * 1989 - Bicentennial Museum/restaurant and Mud Brick house constructed and opened * 1992 - Unveiling of monument The Pioneer and his Dog * -92 - Italian pavilion erected * 1996 - New Italy Hall opened  Heritage listing  The New Italy school site as part of the New Italy Settlement Landscape is of state significance as evidence of a settlement built through the tenacity, forbearance and technical skills (esp. horticultural and architectural) of a unique group of Australian settlers. It is also significant to those displaced Italian migrants who were allowed assisted passage to Australia by Sir Henry Parkes after the ill-fated Marquis de Rays expedition of 1881. Linked to this surviving archaeological heritage both by location and trust management by descendants of these early settlers is the current New Italy Museum Complex. This museum complex stands as a vibrant and living monument to the important contributions made by these (and other) Italian migrants to the past and present cultural and social identity of the North Coast region and the whole state of NSW. Moreover, the Museum complex is a continuing celebration of multicultural Australia and the important links forged between the Italian and wider Australian community. The ongoing patronage of the site by Italian and non Italian local and state dignitaries is evidence of the esteem in which the heritage of New Italy is held by the broader community. The commitment and co-operation of various groups in maintaining and developing the museum complex and school sites as well as the broader New Italy landscape by numerous community groups and individuals provides a continuity of partnership between the Italian and non- Italian community which began when the Italian settlers first arrived. New Italy Settlement was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 9 August 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The sites are physical evidence of an early and possibly first area of Italian settlement in country New South Wales and the ongoing Italian presence through the museum site provide a continuity of Italian association with the settlement. The impact of government policies towards immigration, assimilation education and government support for commercial enterprise are reflected in the manner by which the settlers were initially separated, their later acquisition of land and the varying success of the activities carried out at the settlement. The sites are also evidence late nineteenth century colonisation activities by private individuals, in this case the Marquis de Ray expedition. The sites are significant as part of a settlement that was discussed as a model for the establishment of other colonies in New South Wales The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The sites are significant for their local association with pioneer settler Giacomo Picolli who reflects some of those tenacious and persistent qualities, particularly evident in his sericulture activities, of those earliest settlers, as well his wider advocacy of the Italian heritage of the area through his establishment of the first Park of Peace. They also have association with Dr Florian Volpato, an agent of the Italian consul on the North Coast and a successful businessman was able to organise and mobilise people and generate funds to bring to fruition the wider Italian community's vision for a monument to the pioneers of the area. Furthermore, his artistry enabled the evocation of an Italian homeland throughout the Museum complex which has served to enhance the social value of the complex such that it has become a celebration of Italian heritage throughout Australia. In addition the New Italy Settlement has been associated with the Great Exhibition in Chicago in 1893 (where silk from the new settlement won a Gold Medal), the Paris Exhibition of 1900, and the Brisbane Expo of 1988 reflecting 100 years of involvement in public promotion of elements of Italian-Australian heritage to the world. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The remaining evidence on the sites together with the broader cultural landscape of New Italy is evocative of the former settlement, particularly its isolation and the sense of hardwood scrub blocks from which these pioneers made an existence. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The museum and school sites together with other remnants of the New Italy settlement are held in high esteem by the Italian and historical community on the North Coast. Interest beyond the region is evidenced by the regular visits of the Italian Consul-general for activities and events, continuing a tradition of Consular support since the Italians first arrived in 1881, the Governor General's visit to open the Italian Pavilion, and regular visits by other local/national politicians. The building of the museum and monument to the Italian settlers are evidence of the continuing celebration of the movement of an early community of immigrants into the broader regional community, the achievements and successes along the way and the pride with which the descendants maintain their cultural identity while taking on broader roles in the Australian community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The school site and documentary evidence has potential for research into early 20th century school layout. The school and museum sites as a portion of the larger settlement landscape which includes drainage, wells, church building, tree plantings (incl. fruit, grape, mulberry and native), wine shop and hall demonstrate and provide an opportunity to study the adaptive use of building and agricultural skills and technology in a resource poor environment as well as the physical form of an established settled environment. The archaeological evidence together without throughout the New Italy site reflects cultural building and horticultural practices transported to Australia from Italy and adapted to Australian climatic and environmental conditions, particularly the lack of a permanent above ground water resource. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This is the only known Italian settlement of this type in New South Wales. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The evidence of the school site together with the New Italy settlement as a whole is a physical representation of the tenacity and determination of the Italian pioneers and pioneers in general to create a community in an unfamiliar in and resource poor environment and the physical.

History  Alhambra Theatre The plans for The Alhambra Theatre were lodged by Scottish and Provincial Theatres Ltd on 27 November 1919 and the land and responsibility were transferred to Alhambra Dunfermline Ltd on 25 October 1921. Before the theatre was completed the funds to pay the various contractors was almost exhausted so to permit completion of the building shares in The Alhambra were issued to the various contractors in lieu of final payment of their bills. The Alhambra was built to be both a theatre and a cinema, and opened on 22 August 1922 with a screening of Over the Hill. The theatre was used as a cinema from 1925 to 1965 and a bingo hall from 1965 to 2006. It lay empty in 2007, and was then restored by a private developer, reopening in 2008. Relaunch The Alhambra reopened on 7 June 2008. It is now owned by property developers Linklever Ltd. In March 2016 it was reported that the theatre might close because of financial difficulties  Notable performances  Since the 2008 relaunch the Alhambra has hosted major musicals including Blood Brothers (the first West End touring production to visit Dunfermline for 77 years), The Rocky Horror Show, Grease and Chicago. Many of the top name comedy performers have also performed at the Alhambra: Kevin Bridges, Alan Carr, Dara O'Brian, Tim Minchin, Bill Bailey and the late Sir Ken Dodd are part of a long list. The theatre has also hosted a number of ballet and opera companies, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra. The Scottish National Theatre has performed The House of Bernarda Alba, The Wicker Man and Dracula. The iconic play The Mousetrap has made two visits to the theatre and The Man In Black has also frightened a few patrons. There are also regularly a number of children's shows at various times throughout the year. A popular annual event is The Alhambra's Pantomime which has grown in stature year on year. The theatre has also played host to a number of amateur productions the most notable of these being presented by Dunfermline's Limelight Company whose musical output has been well received by the patrons.  Listed Building Status  The Alhambra is a grade B listed building primarily due to its largely intact fine interior.

In spite of working 14-hour days at the mill and dealing with poor health, disabilities and depression, Macansh produced poetry, journal articles and scientific lectures. Macansh published an anthology of his poetry and a collection of autobiographical works and the texts of his lectures.  Early years  Macansh was born in 1803 in Doune, near Stirling, the illegitimate son of a young flax heckler, Alexander Macansh Sr. Nothing is known about his mother. He was raised by his grandparents, James Macansh (also a flax heckler) and Mary Spittal Macansh. His grandfather died in 1805. Macansh's memories of his early life are all of his grandmother, whom he memorialized in the following poem.Poem Mary Spittal Macansh from Working Man's Bye Hours by Alexander Macansh, published Dunfermline 1866, p 37 > Well I remember all her homely ways Her cup of tea at early morning tide. > When, creeping from our curtained sleeping place I nestled down, half naked, > at her side. Receiving from her kind, ungrudging hand The other crust and, > with the other crust, Some fondling token of maternal trust. Well I remember > how each Sabbath morn She dressed and trimmed me out, and led me down To the > small village kirk, so old and worn I firmly holding by her mourning gown > Dressed in my Highland kilt and milk-white hose She in her widow weeds and > high-heeled shoon, Above her tremulous head and shoulders rose. Macansh started his education at the village school at the age of five or six. He remembered the habit of Mr Young, the domini, of dismissing his pupils at the end of each day with a Latin quotation.Dunfermline Men of Mark by JD Mackie published Dunfermline 1906. Vol 3 p 75 At age 11, Macansh was apprenticed to a flax dresser in Dunfermline. In his poem he remembered > ....that dark winter morn when Mary stood - stood with me in the lamp-light > at her door. Her withered cheek o'er glistening with the dew Of farewell > sorrow; for she inly knew We were about to part for evermore - She to the > skies, and I to wander forth, Our ways divided wide as heaven and earth. In 1814, Macansh started his apprenticeship in a 'sale shop', In this shop, a few men manually prepared flax for women working at their spinning wheels in their own homes.Working Man's Bye-hours p 57 The final process in the preparation of flax for spinning was the combing out of the fibres with an implement called a heckle and the men who did the work were called either 'hecklers' or, more often, flax dressers. In 1816 Andrew Rutherford opened a further mill at Harribrae, Dunfermline, manufacturing white and coloured yarns for table linen, ticking, sheetings, towellings and shirting,The History of Dunfermline by Andrew Mercer published Dunfermline 1828, p 162 Macansh's father was an overseer at Rutherford's mill and probably got his son a job in 1819 in one of the heckling shops,. Macansh worked at the mill until it closed in 1852.Working Man's Bye Hours p 87  The Heckling Shop  Macansh described his time in Rutherford's in an article called 'The Politics of the Workshop'. It was published in instalments in 1854 in The Northern Warder and General Advertiser for the Counties of Fife, Perth, and Forfar. Macansh later updated the article for his anthology Working Man's Bye Hours, published in 1866. 'The Politics of the Workshop' described the political discussions of his fellow workers and their working conditions. > The shop in which I wrought thirty years ago….held a dozen of us, six on > each side with a window between every two. The centre of this window was a > glazed fixture, the upper and under parts of this were hinged wooden blinds > that could be lifted up or lowered down for the admission of fresh air or > the emission of dust. In the winter months, November and December > especially, this dust, the exhalation of a decayed vegetation, hung over our > heads in a cloud so dense that one of my shopmates used to say, playfully, > that he could write his name on it This was not the most Arcadian atmosphere > for men to labour in from six in the morning till eight at night and not > alone for days but for months and years. Many of the men were asthmatic and > all were affected more or less with shortness of breath. Out of the dozen in > our shop and six in another close by belonging to the same employers, are > all dead with the exception of myself and another man.Working Man's Bye > Hours p 95 At age 16, according to Macansh, he was 'attacked with severe pains in his limbs, which, accompanied with a series of cruel accidents reduced him ere he attained his twenty-first year \\"to a state of dwarfish deformity\\". This disability exposed him to 'the constant taunts and jeers of his rougher fellow-workmen and the still more torturing expressions of pity from the more kindly-hearted'..Dunfermline Men of Mark Vol 3 p 73 > ‘The trade at which the writer was employed for thirty-eight years – that of > a flax dresser – was of that kind with permits conversation during working > hours. The noise is not such as to drown the sound of the voice, but in a > large shop, in which a dozen, or perhaps a score of heckles, are ringing, it > is so great as to require the voice to be pitched on a rather high key, that > the words may be heard and understood. Hecklers, for this reason, have a > rather disagreeable habit of talking and reading in the octave key, even in > a private room where there is not necessity for any particular elevation of > voice.'Working Man's Bye Hours p 55 Macansh also described a pet bird in the shop and the hecklers' excursions into the countryside with a donkey they had adopted. > ....we had a shop bird – indeed we almost always had a bird of some sort – a > blackbird, a mavis (song thrush) or a linnet….The bird in question was a > green linnet, a fine, strong chap with the closest and glossiest plumage. > Dick would feed from the hand, perch upon a shoulder and, above everything > in the world, delight in a fight. He would stand in the door of his cage and > bending cock-fashion, unshuffled his tippet and attack the finger….We always > left his cage door open and gave him full liberty of wing and Dick would > suddenly bolt out of his wired domicile and disappearing in the wood behind > the shop or west in the fields, be absent for hours amusing himself, how or > where no-one could say. Then, all at once, he would dive in through one of > the windows and, after taking a sweep two or three times round, would again > enter his cage and be tail-up in his seed box ere one could count two. One > day when the shopmates were in a very disagreeable mood, launching > uncourteous epithets at each other, Dick suddenly swooped in through an open > window from one of his excursions and circling round overhead, made a salute > at every paper cap as he passed. The effect was electric. A good-humoured > laugh took the place of angry invectives and a harmonious conversation > followed.Working Man's Bye Hours p 102 In Macansh's article, he described the lifestyles that produced differing political opinions, beginning with the aristocrat, followed by the middle class merchant and ending with the workman. > The poor workman, again, standing at the foot of the social ladder is by > position a Radical - a Chartist. He says, \\"It is no fault of mine that I am > poor, but because I am poor I am disenfranchised, am I? My father, like > myself, was a hard working man, with a numerous family and he might have > been, in the opinion of these two gentlemen up the trap, not very > intelligent.

One of them was the > Scotsman, not generally liked by our Radical shopmates, for it was then, > thirty-five years ago, now forty-seven, wholly literary and political and > the tone of its articles, though the most liberal in Scotland at that > period, did not come up to our men's ideas of the true Radical standard. The > favourites were Wooler's Gazette and his Black Dwarf, the former long since > defunct - a firebrand and, like all its class, as stupid as it was violent. > The latter a firebrand also....We read by turns, column about, commencing > with the editor's commentary, then the Parliamentary debates, then the > miscellaneous matter - a murder or a horrible accident always having the > preference.Working Man's Bye Hours p 55  Scholar, Poet, Journalist and Lecturer  After working a 14-hour day in the mill, Macansh would eat supper and then start studying. > In his humble abode in one of the closes off the High Street of Dunfermline, > he held championship with the greatest and brightest of intellects. He > resumed the Latin studies which fascinated him in his early boyhood at > Doune, when old Mr Young, the village schoolmaster, was wont to dismiss his > scholars with a classical phrase and caused a far-sounding shout of Ad > scholam to be piped when the hour for opening the school approached. He also > taught himself French and two or three other Continental languages, without, > of course, becoming scholastically proficient; and I think he also knew a > little Greek and Hebrew, on which he occasionally held consultations with > his friend the Rev.

According to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, they are the most serious in the country in modern history. The summer was unusually warm and dry, significantly raising the risk of fire. Firefighters from multiple countries were involved in fighting the fires. Many people were evacuated from their homes, but there were no fatalities. Heatwave and cause of fire Satellite picture of the wildfires near Ljusdal Sweden experienced an unusually long heatwave and had only of rain from the beginning of May to late July. May 2018 was the warmest May and July 2018 was the warmest July ever recorded in Sweden. As of mid-July, temperatures in Scandinavia were more than above normal. Several of the fires were started by people using disposable barbecues, though bans on these were in place due to the weather conditions. Some were started by lightning strikes. Wildfires also occurred in the neighbouring countries Denmark, Finland and Norway, but no casualties due to wildfires were reported in Scandinavia. Timeline The first significant wildfires in Sweden were recorded in May, and by 23 July there were more than fifty, covering . The fires were distributed throughout much of Sweden, ranging from north of the Arctic Circle to the southernmost county of Scania. The largest areas lost to fire are in Gävleborg and Jämtland, each , followed by Dalarna at and Västernorrland at . Based on data from the last decade, the expected number of wildfires in July would be three. It is highly unusual for areas of this size to be affected by wildfires (both individual fires and total size of all), but historically there have been larger, notably in 1888 where burned. Most affected areas in 2018 have relatively low human population densities, but it was still necessary to evacuate many people from several villages. In areas not under risk of fire but affected by smoke thousands of people were asked to stay indoors and close their windows. In addition to the country's firefighters and civilian volunteers, Sweden's armed forces were involved, mostly providing manpower and equipment such as helicopters. Locally the air force also used aerial bombings by JAS 39 Gripen fighter jets to make firebreaks and draw oxygen from the wildfires. By June, several fires were out of control and Sweden requested help from neighbouring countries and via the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism. Sweden received help from Denmark (firefighters and equipment), Estonia (firefighters and equipment), France (soldiers, firefighters, water bombing aircraft), Finland (firefighters), Germany (firefighters, helicopters), Italy (water bombing aircraft), Lithuania (helicopter), Norway (firefighters and equipment, water bombing helicopters), Poland (firefighters and equipment), and Portugal (water bombing aircraft). In late July, Sweden received its first significant rain in months. Combined with firefighting, this meant that fires generally were reduced, although new ones continued to appear. This, along with the high risk of fire elsewhere in Europe, meant that firefighters from most countries had returned to their own countries by 30 July, although the Danish remained on active duty in Sweden into August. Some water bombing aircraft returned to their own countries, but others remained in Sweden. 2019 In March, several wildfires occurred in the south of Sweden. According to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, the risk of fire was unusually high for the time of year.

Captivated by the wildness and artistic freedom they conveyed, he felt the urge to tear down barriers in his own work. He began to paint and draw on cork panels mounted on wood, lacerating the surface with knives, screwdrivers and electric saws, burning it with a wood-burning etching pencil and splattering it with substances like coffee, mud, ketchup and red wine. His work is also rooted in the iconography of the Levant. He references ancient visual languages and hieroglyphics while maintaining a universal theme combining prehistoric elements and childlike symbolism.Avner Sher Common motifs in his work are fish, faces, spirals and images of flora and fauna. Sometimes he incorporates Biblical verses, especially from the Book of Genesis and Psalms. As the son of parents who survived Dachau, Sher grew up in the shadow of the Holocaust and the numbers tattooed on their arms. The tattoo thus became a visual code in his work.

The house is reputed to have been constructed by the Scottish masons who had been employed in the construction of Edmund Blacket's University of Sydney buildings. The stone was reported to be quarried on site from a huge rock in the vicinity of the present-day Norfolk Island pine tree. William Carss died on 26 May 1878. He was survived by his children Mary, Anne and James. There was also a housekeeper called Amelia Claggett. Carss was buried in the vault near the present day recreation centre. Carss' wife died in 1853. The property was transferred to the daughters Mary and Anne on 1 August 1878. This was subsequently amended on 3 April 1879 solely to Mary. On Mary Carss' death in 1916 the cottage was bequeathed to the Sydney Sailors' Home apparently in accordance with her father's wish. The transfer however did not eventuate until after James' death in the following year. James married the housekeeper, Amelia Claggett, on his death bed. Amelia Claggett remained in the cottage until she was forced to vacate taking most of the furniture with her. In the mid 1920s the trustees of the Sydney Sailors' Home sold the property to the Kogarah Council for A£12,000. The estate was divided into recreational and residential spaces. The portion that was reserved for park purposes was opened and dedicated on Australia Day 1924 and the remaining 374 suburban lots were offered for sale that day. The cottage was converted to a new use as the residence of the park's ranger. The first ranger was Joseph Harald Coxhead, who held the position between 1924 and 1953. In 1928 a health inspector's report noted extensive white ant activity, inadequate ventilation and poor drainage. At this time outbuildings were demolished and internal alterations and modifications made to the cottage. During the 1930s landscaping works included the construction of the stone walling, arbor and stone seats. As a result of the enthusiasm aroused by the lead-up to the 1970 James Cook bicentenary celebrations, Kogarah Council decided to form a historical society and to lease Carss Cottage to the Historical Society for use as a historical museum.  Description  The cottage has sandstone walls and a slate roof. = Condition = Physical condition is good. Archaeological potential is excellent for those documented demolished original outbuildings. = Modifications and dates = *1865 - built *1924 - estate subdivided and cottage converted for park ranger *1928 - outbuildings demolished and internal alterations and modifications made to the cottage. *1930s - landscaping works included the construction of the stone walling, arbor and stone seats.  Heritage listing  As at 2 August 2012, Carss Cottage formed a substantial part of a rare setting and is one of the oldest buildings in the southern Sydney area south of the Cooks River. It is the oldest building in the Kogarah area and is associated with the early development of the Kogarah area. William Carss was of sufficient stature in Sydney society in the 1830s as a master craftsman to have been a member of the founding committee of the Sydney Mechanics School of Arts in 1834.

History In 1984, the Major of Paris decided to trasfer the water's municipal service in the hands of three private entities with a direct contract and without a public procurement procedure. The property of water wasn't formally transferred and was kept as a public common good. Eau et Force and Compagnie des Eaux de Paris had a 25-years concession for the distribution and customer services respectively related to the right and left banks of the River Seine. In 1987, the water production and transport were delegated for a 25-years period to SAGEP, a semi-public company owned by Ville de Paris (70%) and Suez & Veolia (28%). Eau de Paris was created in 2008 after a ballot initiative from then Mayor Bertrand Delanoë. The city's water was then substantially managed by two private companies (Veolia and Suez) which the municipal government bought out. Operations The company distributes 563,000 m³ of drinking water a day. In 2010 the company began installing drinking fountains dispensing fizzy water in the city.

It involves a reduction in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Anemia is an extremely common condition in pregnancy and postpartum world-wide, conferring a number of health risks to mother and child. Maternal signs and symptoms are usually non-specific, but can include: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea, palpitations and dizziness. There are numerous well-known maternal consequences of anemia including: maternal cardiovascular strain, reduced physical and mental performance, reduced peripartum blood reserves, increased risk for peripartum blood product transfusion, and increased risk for maternal mortality.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms may be mild such as fatigue and pallor or more severe, such as fainting or difficulty breathing.  Causes  In the simplest of terms, anemia results from impaired production of red blood cells, increased destruction of red blood cells or blood loss. Anemia can be congenital (ie, conditions such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia) or acquired (ie, conditions such as iron deficiency anemia or anemia as a result of an infection). The most frequent cause of anemia in pregnancy worldwide is iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Iron is needed for many physiological processes in the body, and observational studies indicate that iron deficiency during pregnancy may independently result in cognitive or behavioral abnormalities in the child. Babies of women with IDA have an increased risk of being low birthweight, being born prematurely, being more susceptible to infections, and suffering death in utero. Aside from iron deficiency, other causes of anemia in the peripartum woman include nutritional deficits such as folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies. Congenital causes of anemia that may worsen during pregnancy include: hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, as well as conditions of red cell structural and enzymatic abnormalities such as hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis. Bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections (such as malaria and hookworm) may also result in anemia. Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia and anemia due to hematologic or non-hematologic (ie, colonic adenocarcinoma) malignancy may rarely occur during pregnancy as well. Peri and postpartum hemorrhage may induce or worsen pre-existing anemia in the postpartum woman. Prevention and treatment, especially of iron deficiency anemia, is widely available, but not consistently performed. Severe anemia may require red blood cell transfusions especially if there is also significant blood loss at birth. * Maternal deficiency of iron is by far the most common cause of obstetric anemia and is a treatable condition * Maternal anemia is frequent despite guidelines and widely available treatment * Maternal anemia is thought to be the most frequent cause of maternal death worldwide * Anemia during pregnancy increases the risk of induction of labor and cesarean section * Anemia during pregnancy increases the risk of postpartum anemia * Iron deficiency during pregnancy is linked to a number of harmful effects on the fetus such as intrauterine growth restriction, death in utero, infection, preterm delivery and neurodevelopmental damage, which may be irreversible * Failure to treat maternal iron deficiency may carry over to a woman's next pregnancy Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in the pregnant woman. During pregnancy, the average total iron requirement is about 1200 mg per day for a 55 kg woman. This iron is used for the increase in red cell mass, placental needs and fetal growth. About 40% of women start their pregnancy with low to absent iron stores and up to 90% have iron stores insufficient to meet the increased iron requirements during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Deficiencies of folate and vitamin B12 can lead to anemia in the pregnant patient. Parasitic infestations with hookworm or Plasmodium species may also result in anemia. Other infectious causes include: bacterial, fungal and viral infections. Congenital anemias such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia may worsen during pregnancy due to increased demands. Even less common causes include hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, and hematologic malignancies in the pregnant woman. The majority of women presenting with postpartum anemia have pre-delivery iron deficiency anemia or iron deficiency anemia combined with acute blood loss during delivery. = Postpartum bleeding = Postpartum hemorrhage is typically defined as blood loss in excess of 500 mL following vaginal delivery and in excess of 1000 mL following cesarean delivery. Primary PPH is that which occurs within 24 hours after delivery, while secondary PPH can occur up to 12 weeks following delivery. PPH is relatively common with an incidence of 5–15% of all births. However, life-threatening PPH, defined by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) as an estimated blood loss in excess of 2500 mL or receipt of > 5 units of blood products or treatment of coagulopathy, occurs in an estimated 3.7 per 1000 pregnancies.  Diagnosis  The most useful test with which to render a diagnosis of anemia is a low RBC count, however hemoglobin and hematocrit values are most commonly used in making the initial diagnosis of anemia. It is important to note that references ranges for these values are often not the same for pregnant women. Additionally, laboratory values for pregnancy often change throughout the duration of a woman’s gestation. Testing involved in diagnosing anemia in the pregnant woman must be tailored to each individual patient. Suggested tests include: hemoglobin and hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), erythrocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear to assess red blood cell morphology. If iron deficiency is suspected, additional tests such as: serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation, and plasma or serum ferritin may be warranted. Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in the postpartum woman is classified as anemia. = Pregnancy = Hormonal changes in the pregnant woman result in an increase in circulating blood volume to 100 mL/kg with a total blood volume of approximately 6000–7000 mL. While red cell mass increases by 15–20% during pregnancy, plasma volume increases by 40%. Hemoglobin levels less than 11 g/dL during the first trimester, less than 10.5 g/dL during the second and third trimesters and less than 10 mg/dL in the postpartum period are considered anemic.  Prevention Anemia is common in pregnancy because a woman needs to have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen around her body and to her baby. Prevention can occur anemia before and during via blood tests during prenatal care visits, an iron-rich diet, and iron supplements. Iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by taking 15–60 mg of iron orally daily. Treating anemia during pregnancy and managing obstetric hemorrhage reduces the incidence of iron deficiency anemia. Preventing anemia after pregnancy is also important.  Treatment  For treatment of pregnant woman with iron deficiency anemia, doses of oral elemental iron between 65–200 mg per day are recommended. While oral iron is presently the gold standard for mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia, treatment doses of elemental iron often result in significant gastrointestinal side effects, resulting in reduced compliance. If oral iron cannot be tolerated or is proven ineffective, intravenous iron can induce repletion of iron stores within 1–2 days and normalization of hemoglobin levels in 1–3 weeks. Treatment should target the underlying disease or condition affecting the patient. * The majority of obstetric anemia cases can be treated based on their etiology if diagnosed in time. Oral iron supplementation is the gold standard for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia and intravenous iron can be used when oral iron is not effective or tolerated from the second trimester of pregnancy onwards. * Treatment of postpartum hemorrhage is multifactorial and includes medical management, surgical management along with blood product support. = Transfusion = Blood product transfusion carries a number of risks both infectious as well as non-infectious. Transfusion transmissible diseases include, but are not limited to the following: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, West Nile virus, syphilis, Chagas disease, Zika virus, Dengue fever and Chikungunya virus. Non-infectious risks of blood product transfusion include, but are not limited to: hemolytic transfusion reactions, allergic and anaphylactic transfusion reactions, transfusion associated circulatory overload, transfusion related acute lung injury, transfusion associated graft versus host disease and febrile non- hemolytic transfusion reactions. Because of these risks, blood product transfusion should only be used in cases of acute bleeding, severe cases of refractory anemia and in conditions where maternal hemoglobin levels are so low, that there is thought to be imminent risk to mother or fetus.  Epidemiology  In healthy women after normal delivery, the prevalence of anemia (defined as hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) 1 week postpartum is 14% in iron supplemented women and 24% in non-supplemented women.

He was immediately given the shikona of Ryūden, with the \\"Ryū\\" part taken from his hometown school and the \\"den\\" part from the legendary wrestler Raiden. He was talked of, alongside Masunoyama, as a candidate for the first wrestler born in the Heisei era to reach the sekitori ranks when he produced a 5–2 score at the rank of makushita 15 in November 2009. However his progress then stalled with two consecutive make-koshi, and he suffered a concussion after falling from the dohyo in a match against Takanoiwa in March 2010, and was embarrassed when he had to be carried off in a wheelchair. He was overtaken by Takayasu who did become the first Heisei born sekitori in November 2010, with Masunoyama. However after scoring a perfect 7–0 record and taking the makushita championship, Ryūden eventually reached the jūryō division himself after the September 2012 tournament. He was the first sekitori produced by the new Takadagawa head Akinoshima, who had taken over the running of the stable from former ōzeki Maenoyama in 2009. He was also the first sekitori from Yamanashi Prefecture since Hidenohana 24 years earlier. However Ryūden suffered a fracture of his right hip joint in his juryo debut in November and had to withdraw from the tournament. During his long injury recuperation he made two abortive attempts to return, breaking the hip twice more. This resulted in him falling all the way down to jonokuchi 17 in the rankings. For four consecutive tournaments from January until July 2014, although still injured, he fought (and won) one match at the end of the tournament, solely to prevent falling off the banzuke completely. He was finally fit to return in September 2014 and won three consecutive yusho to quickly return to the third highest makushita division. He was finally promoted back to jūryō in November 2016. Only Hokutokuni (off the banzuke) and Kotobeppu (jonokuchi 39) had returned to jūryō from lower ranks than Ryūden had. Ryūden was promoted to the top makuuchi division in January 2018, becoming the second top division wrestler from Takadagawa stable after Kagayaki to achieve this since the new head coach took over. He was the first Yamanashi Prefecture native to be ranked in makuuchi since Onohana in March 1988. He scored ten wins in his top division debut and shared the Fighting Spirit prize with fellow newcomer Abi. Since then, he has stayed in makuuchi and has mainly shown solid performances. In May 2019 he won ten bouts and received his first Technique prize. He was promoted to komusubi for the July 2019 tournament, the first from Yamanashi Prefecture since Fujizakura 47 years earlier. Fighting style Ryūden is a yotsu sumo specialist who prefers grappling techniques. His favourite winning kimarite is yori-kiri, with a moro-zashi hold, or both arms inside his opponent's.

Byrne (born March 24, 1981) is an American publisher, writer, and non- profit director. He is co-owner of Raw Story Media and AlterNet Media, which publish the online progressive political news sites RawStory.com and AlterNet.org respectively. He is also the founder and Executive Director of Prevention 305, a nonprofit focused on increasing access to HIV prevention drugs in the Miami, Florida area. Prior to Raw Story, he wrote briefly for the Boston Globe and McClatchy Newspapers and has been published in The Atlantic. He is also a published fiction writer. Early life and education Byrne was raised in a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts by Cathy and Jeffrey Byrne. Cathy Byrne is a circuit judge of the Massachusetts District Courts and Jeffrey Byrne is a family physician. Byrne attended Concord Academy and graduated from Oberlin College in 2003. At Oberlin College, he founded The Grape, which remains the college’s alternative student newspaper. He was also editor of the Oberlin Review, where he wrote an exposé about steroid abuse on the football team. Career During college, Byrne worked as a stringer for The Boston Globe Northwest, a discontinued suburban section of the newspaper, and for McClatchy Newspapers as an intern in Washington, DC. Byrne founded RawStory.com, which was first published on February 1, 2004. The site was originally conceived as a liberal version of the Drudge Report. In the early years, Raw Story focused on national security issues, American politics, and reporting on anti-gay political figures who were themselves closeted gays. Byrne founded Raw Story when he was 23. Byrne interviewed political figures and authors of the day, including former House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers (D-MI) and historian Howard Zinn. His reporting also focused on civil liberties, including articles critical of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama's warrantless wiretapping program. In 2010, Byrne stepped down as editor of Raw Story. He remains the company's CEO. Byrne and his business partner, Michael Rogers, acquired the progressive news website AlterNet and TheNewCivilRightsMovement.com in 2018. AlterNet was acquired from the nonprofit Independent Media Institute. The sale was covered by The Wall Street Journal. =Outing of political figures= Byrne and Rogers outed as gay numerous politicians and political staff who voted or advocated against gay rights in the mid-2000s. Among the first was former Republican Congressman Ed Schrock (R-VA). Rogers and Byrne reported that Schrock, who once disparaged gays in the military, had left two advertisements on a gay phone sex line. Schrock resigned August 31, 2004, after the recordings were revealed and posted online. Byrne also reported on the campaign manager for President George W. Bush, Ken Mehlman. The site, along with Rogers, outed Mehlman in 2004. Mehlman was targeted because the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign issued anti-gay flyers in Ohio and because of the anti-gay marriage amendment Bush supported. A proxy denied that Mehlman was gay in 2005. Mehlman, however, admitted that he was gay in 2010, and eventually went on to campaign for gay marriage in New York. Writing Byrne published his first fiction piece in the Baltimore Review in Spring, 2013. The piece, titled, “I’m Going to Let You Go, Okay?” mentioned his early work on Raw Story. He has also been published in the Chicago Review. HIV prevention advocacy In 2015, Byrne began advocating for the promotion of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) after a false positive HIV test. His first campaign on South Beach was covered by The Miami Herald, “I AM PrEP,” in November 2015, which involved posters created for bars and clubs and brochures for health centers. Byrne wrote an article about his in a long-form piece for The Atlantic in December, 2015. CBS News 4 Miami covered his PrEP advocacy in March 2017. Byrne is also an at-large board member of Arianna's Center, a Ft. Lauderdale-based nonprofit focused on serving and empowering the transgender community in South Florida. In 2017, Byrne founded an HIV prevention nonprofit, Prevention 305, which focuses specifically on linking Latinx immigrants to HIV prevention medication in the Miami, Florida area.

Its design is attributed to Richard Norman Shaw who is likely to have influenced its design, and built by Charles Halstead the supervising architect. It is also known as West Maling (Revival Life Centre) and Weigall House. The property is owned by Australian Evangelist Association. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Penshurst= Early botanist Dr Robert Townson (1763-1827) received one of the first land grants in this area. The he was granted in 1808, were west of the present King George's Road, extending to today's Boundary Road. In 1809 he received another north of his original grant. His property passed to John Connell in 1830, whose name was taken for a subdivision of the land in 1869. J. C. and E. P. Laycock acquired the land and carried out the subdivision, which they called 'Connell's Bush', the western part of which was bought by Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (who had large land holdings in the district before 1861 and bought the south-western section of Townson's 1808 grant). Located on the Illawarra railway line between Hurstville and Mortdale. The early work in this area was timber-cutting and small farming. The railway came through in 1886 and opened up the suburb as a residential area: the platform was established in 1890. A former Governor- General of Australia, Lord de L'Isle, whose family seat in England is Penshurst Place, visited the suburb in 1961 during his term of office (1961–65). Penshurst in Kent has the same misty quality that Penshurst, Sydney had in earlier times, when southerly winds blew a sea mist across from Oatley Bay on the Georges River. Today the larger number of buildings in the area make this quality less evident.Pollen, 1996 =West Maling= West Maling on King Georges Road (formerly Belmore Road) was built in 1889Staas, 1984 says 1888 for Albert Bythesea Weigall, a former Headmaster of Sydney Grammar School and was originally named Weigall House. Weigall lived there until 1912.Staas, 1984, 5 Weigall was born in Nantes, France in 1840 and later became possibly the most famous headmaster of Sydney Grammar School, a position he enjoyed and held with notable success from 1866-1912. He built West Mailing as his home on top of a hill in Penshurst where it still has a commanding view over Botany Bay.Davis, 1983, 119 This grand mansion in the Elizabethan Tudor style is thought to be a rare example of the work of the English architect, Richard Norman Shaw. Its construction was supervised by local architect, Charles Halstead, the final cost being A£3,561, 10 shillings and tuppence. It is conspicuous amongst the many red brick mansions of Sydney's late Victorian period because of the Federation Queen Anne style of its architecture and the quality of its detail. It is an exceptional and rare example of that period from the mid-1860s onwards which was popularised by the English architects, William Eden Nesfield and Richard Norman Shaw and their followers. It appears to be the earliest Queen Anne design to appear in Sydney. The original garden was set out during the Federation period and from the beautiful wrought iron carriage gates set between pillars a privet hedge extended along Penshurst Avenue. Some of this had to be removed in 1983 to allow builders access to build the underground chapel and avoid damaging these gates. The Weigall family enjoyed an elegant lifestyle. A broad front garden once separated the house from King Georges Road, until part was resumed by Kogarah Council for road widening in December 1970.Earnshaw & Hallibone, 2007, 138 The history of ownership is uncertain between 1912 and 1960. The property had been lived in by a succession of families until 1953. On 27 August 1953Davis, 1983, says this date was 1960 the property was bought by the Oblate Fathers, a Roman Catholic Order of Priests devoted to religious education and counselling. From here they conducted what was virtually a Theological Correspondence School which, pre-computers, required the installation of a printing press. Their lifestyle was spartan. Each father slept on a stretcher bed alongside his massive oak desk where he worked during the day but in spite of their frugal lifestyle, high maintenance costs and rising rates forced the Oblate Fathers to relocate. On 17 May 1972 the property was sold to Norman Lloyd Armstrong of Sylvania, Gordon Barnard Gibbs of Wentworthville, both Ministers of Religion, and Mrs Ruth Margaret Harvey of Caringbah, as Trustees for the Revival Life Assembly.(Staas, 1984, 5 says in it was sold in 1971 to the Abundant Life Ministry)(Davis, 1983 says it was 1977 and sold to the Australian Evangelistic Association) This is an Assemblies of God Church, a non-denominational religious group worshipping in an evangelistic charismatic way. The ballroom in became a chapel but as church membership grew there was a need to increase in size the meeting area.Staas, 1984, 139-140 In 1981 Kogarah Council sought advice from the Heritage Council in relation to the proposed erection of a new chapel in the front garden of the property. Whilst the existing building was not to be physically affected by the proposed chapel, Kogarah Council considered that the design and location of it could significantly detract from the appearance of the building. At that time West Maling was the administrative and ecclesiastical centre of the Australian Evangelistic Association and is known as its Revival Life Centre. The Heritage Council considered the matter and an Interim Heritage Order was placed over the property on 31July 1981. Following liaison and consultation between the Australian Evangelistic Association and the Heritage Council and employment of an architect, a satisfactory chapel was designed and built. In 1983 architects Noel Bell and Rose-Marie Willett of Noel Bell Ridley Smith & Partners were given a brief to design a chapel which would accommodate 350 people and at the same time preserve the house and protect the century-old trees that surrounded it. This was accomplished by building the chapel underground beneath a car park at the front of the building. Constructed of concrete and coloured deep brown to blend with the warm toned brickwork of West Maling, the new chapel has galleries which bring its capacity up to 400 people.Staas, 1984, 140 The project also sought to provide minister's offices, book and tape library and a mothers' room for infants. The problem of providing the required accommodation plus parking on the site for 31 cars and a one-way road system, seemed at first insoluble, as the garden formed an important part of the property's character. A separate low-key building with minimal impact on existing structures and landscape features was chosen. The natural fall of the land to the south and presence of a former tennis court at a lower level to the house suggested a design in which the bulk of the new building could be cut into the hillside so the roof of the building could act as a natural extension to the main garden front without visually obstructing West Maling. This roof was then designed to act as a car parking area with access to the original circular drive and entry gates. In general terms the existing landscaping was substantially retained and supplemented with new trees to restore the enclosure of West Maling along the Penshurst Avenue frontage. In recognition of its historic and architectural significance a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 2 December 1983.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council 24 August 1983 The new chapel was sited to allow for preservation of as many mature trees as possible. The roof serves as a car park, backed by a row of brush box (Lophostemon confertus), so does not detract from the stately old house. The colour of the new building matches the old in its rendered finish and the descending entry steps are partly concealed by a pergola festooned with potato vine (Solanum jasminoides). One of the trees removed for construction was a large jacaranda. A semi-mature golden false-cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana 'Crippsii') in a circular bed opposite the front door also added to the gold and green theme. In consultation with the architects and clients Mary Davis designed the gardens which were to enhance the new building while relating to the Tudor (Revival) style residence and the clients' requirements relating to ongoing maintenance. A yellow, white and blue colour scheme was used, Kentia palms (Kentia spp.) in shady areas and blue and white Cape leadwort (Plumbago capensis) used extensively. The privet hedge was removed and replaced with plumbago. New trees include jacaranda, golden honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos 'Sunburst') and evergreen magnolia (M.grandiflora). Low maintenance shrubs included Abelia x grandiflora and A.g.'Variegata', sweet box (Murraya paniculata), St.John's wort (Hypericum patulum), bird-of-paradise flowers (Strelitzia spp.)(already existing on site) and golden breath-of-heaven (Diosma). Below the brush box trees shrubs and ground covers of heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica), box (Buxus microphylla), some existing tree ferns (Cyathea sp.), kaffir lilies (Clivia miniata), peacock iris (Dietes grandiflora), cast-iron plants (Aspidistra elatior), variegated spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum 'Variegatum') and periwinkle (Vinca major) have been planted in drifts. In 1984 through the Heritage Assistance Program a dollar for dollar grant of $6,000 was provided to the Revival Life Centre Church to assist in the repainting of West Maling. Today West Maling is a vibrant religious centre and because of the purpose for which it was used over many years, it has survived undamaged and in excellent condition. West Maling was transferred to the NSW State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  ;Grounds and garden A broad front garden once separated the house from King Georges Road, until part of the frontage was resumed by Kogarah Council for road widening in 1970. Wrought iron gates between rendered pillars open onto an entry drive with bull nosed brick edging. To the front and sides of the house, the original garden and driveways remain. Mature pines, Prunus sp., palms and an avenue of brush box (Lophostemon confertus) are the predominant planting.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council, 24 August 1983 The fine mature trees in the North-east corner of the site (i.e.: corner of King Georges Road and Penshurst Avenue)(black bean (Castanospermum australe), Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), silky oak (Grevillea robusta), 7 existing camphor laurels (Cinnamommum camphora), Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) and the mature Himalayan cedar and Norfolk Island pine immediately to the north-west of the new chapel (1982) are unaffected by the new work and are retained.NBRS (2), 1982. A 1/1983 landscape plan (Mary Davis Landscape Consultant) notes existing trees (all of the above ones plus) including on the north-east boundary (King Georges Road side) 2 existing Ochna serrulata, further south (adjoining the new chapel) existing palm seedlings, Cotoneaster pannosa, aged juniper (recommended to be replaced later with a black bean), existing oleander (near steps off King Georges Road to access the new chapel). This plan notes on the south of the side lawn east of the house (near the new chapel) an existing juniper (Juniperus sp.), and another Himalayan cedar (closer to the house). On the southern boundary (by the new chapel) it notes 4 existing African olives (Olea europaea var. Africana), 1 heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica), 2 existing tree ferns (Dicksonia antarctica), Philodendron selloum, and further west, a fruit salad plant (Monstera deliciosa). In the south-western corner (car parking area) it notes 5 existing brush box (Lophostemon confertus), a red hibiscus, existing golden cypress (Cupressus brunniana 'Aurea'), climbing roses and picking garden running along the western boundary to the north. In the north-western corner still on the western boundary it notes existing red and white oleanders (Nerium oleander cv.s), and an existing Browallia sp. On the northern (Penshurst Road) boundary it notes an existing privet hedge (recommended for replacement with one of Plumbago auriculata). Flanking the original driveway entrance on this boundary it notes an existing Port wine magnolia (Michelia figo) on the west, and a Bougainvillea trailli on the eastern side. In the circular bed in the carriage loop is an existing golden dwarf cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana cv., possibly C.l.'Crippsii'.Read, S., pers.comm., 2006 Lawns (presumably original are on the north of the house and to the east of the drive in the north-eastern corner. Around the house, the Davis plan notes on the northern facade, a bed containing existing (and recommended new) roses, a \\"Cecile Brunner\\" rose existing on a pergola at the north-eastern corner of the house, a perennial picking garden featuring Shasta daisies, perennial phlox, gold and white tall bearded Iris, Canterbury bells etc. To the south-eastern corner of the house is an existing picking garden beside an area of lawn, 2 existing camellias, existing stone paved area with a well in it. South of the house is another paved area, with an existing African olive, pruned to shrub size. Azaleas must have existed then in the front perennial garden, as these were recommended for transplanting behind (west of) the house in expanded garden beds in front of blank walls and plumbing on wall surfaces). The new chapel was sited to allow for preservation of as many mature trees as possible. The roof serves as a car park, backed by a row of brush box (Lophostemon confertus), so does not detract from the stately old house. The colour of the new building matches the old in its rendered finish and the descending entry steps are partly concealed by a pergola festooned with potato vine (Solanum jasminoides). One of the trees removed for construction was a large jacaranda.

House: West Maling is one of the purest examples of the Queen Anne style evidenced. It is therefore likely to be a copy of an English residence. The work of British Architect Norman Shaw is likely to have influenced its design. Constructed in a warm brick in English bond, it is a particularly attractive two storey residence featuring steeply pitched slate roofs, ornate brick chimneys, stained glass windows and Tudor influenced battening. The gable ends are of timber and stucco. The verandah features timber posts with ornamental brackets and the chimneys rising high above the high gabled roof are a dominant feature. Admission to the house is through a massive cedar panelled front door set into a sandstone arch with Gothic flutings. The entry porch is decorated with mosaic artistry. Interior doors are between three and four inches thick and have arched heads set into inverted arch architraves which are said to appear more Medieval than Elizabethan. A pair of stained-glass Inglenook windows date the building to AD 1889. The ballroom retains the original set of six stained-glass windows depicting English poets and essayists: Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakspeare (sic), John Milton, John Bunyan, Edmund Spicer and Francis Bacon. Facing these windows is a low dais on which musicians once performed. This room in later years became a chapel. The joinery includes carved cedar mantelpieces, the one in the dining room having a carved panel bearing a crest and the motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" (always faithful), and some rooms have pressed metal ceilings.Earnshaw & Hallibone, 2007, 138-9 Internally and externally virtually all the original joinery remains. Of particular interest is the pointed arch shape to the top of the doors and the fireplaces and inglenook in the living room. Chapel (1983): Underground structure with roof top car parking. Concrete construction coloured deep brown to tone in with house. Galleries bring its seating capacity to 400.Earnshaw & Hallibone, 2007, 140 = Condition = As at 8 February 2006, the setting modified significantly by 1982 underground chapel and above-roof parking, and additional car parking to the south-west (rear) of the house/property. Several trees removed. Internally and externally virtually all the original joinery remains as do the original driveways and gardens. = Modifications and dates = 1982 - approval to construct a 350 seat chapel below ground at the side (south-east) of the building near to King Georges Road, with off street parking above it on the rooftop. Removal of trees: a young jacaranda, a number of conifers bordering the old access lane near the S-E boundary, a spruce within the old tennis court area and 2 brush box trees to enlarge the driveway area and provide additional parking at the rear of the house.  Heritage listing  As at 15 March 2006, West Maling has a high level of aesthetic significance at a state level as one of the purest examples of the Queen Anne style of architecture existing today and it is thought to be the first of its type of residence built in Australia. Its significance is enhanced by its retention internally and externally of virtually all the original joinery, its original driveways and part of its original gardens. It has historical associations with Albert Bythesea Weigall, the first headmaster of Sydney Grammar School, having been built in 1889 for his residence. The site has acquired social significance at a local level for its continued use by the Revival Life Centre as a church since the 1980s and prior to this time its use as a monastery.Branch Manager, 1983, NBRS, 2006, both modified by Read, S., 2006 West Maling was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It was built in 1889 for Albert Bythesea Weigall, the first headmaster of Sydney Grammar School. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

It stars Tye Sheridan, Denis Lavant, Hannah Gross, Udo Kier and Jeff Goldblum. The script is loosely based on the story of controversial physician Walter Freeman. It had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on August 30, 2018. It was released on July 26, 2019, by Kino Lorber. Plot In the 1950s, young introvert Andy (Sheridan) works at his father Frederick's (Kier) ice rink following the institutionalization, lobotomization, and presumed death of his mother. After Frederick dies suddenly on the ice, Andy encounters family friend Dr. Wallace Fiennes (Goldblum), the man responsible for his mother's lobotomization. He invites Andy to travel with him, having Andy act as his photographer, journalist, and assistant. The duo travel from asylum to asylum, Wallace performing lobotomies while Andy reluctantly documents. At night, Andy repeatedly attempts to contact his mother's spirit using a planchette. On one occasion, Andy meets a woman who tells him that her daughter Susan is a patient at their next destination. There, they meet Jack (Lavant) and his daughter, Susan (Gross). Jack requests that Wallace perform a lobotomy on Susan, who has been exhibiting rebellious behavior. While Wallace prepares his equipment in the other room, Susan seduces Andy and they start having sex. Wallace interrupts them, then performs the procedure. Later that night, Andy sneaks out and hitchhikes back to Jack's house, where a drunken Jack rants about life and art in a mixture of French and English. While initially unresponsive, Susan displays affection towards Andy after he touches her. At the next institution, Andy watches as an insubordinate patient is dragged across a hallway by hospital employees. Andy repeats the behavior, destroying the chairs in the hallway and shouting at the hospital attendants just as the patient had before being restrained. Wallace questions Andy, during which he states that Susan was his first sexual encounter, that he believes his dreams are real, and that he believes it has been his mother's spirit communicating through the planchette. Andy subsequently submits to being lobotomized. Wallace drops Andy off at Jack's home and departs. Andy and Susan attend one of Jack's music therapy sessions.

Reception The film received generally mixed reviews following its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, though Goldblum's performance as Dr. Fiennes earned universal praise. Eric Kohn of IndieWire praised the film, saying it is the \\"warmest and most inviting work from a director who traffics in an acquired taste.\\" Guy Lodge, writing for Variety, wrote that \\"Alverson's serene affectations serve a stern, stark thesis about our evolving understanding of mental health, as well as America's dubious romanticization of its heartland.\\" Peter Bradshaw at The Guardian was less enthusiastic, commending Jeff Goldblum's supporting turn and finding aspects of the film \\"rather brilliant\\" but that it ultimately \\"succumbs to a rather banal inability to decide where to take the story.\\" , 64% of the 58 critical reviews compiled on Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with a weighted average of 5.77/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"The Mountain finds its provocative director further honing his craft -- but formal flair and an engrossing Jeff Goldblum performance may not be enough to sway the unconverted.\\" References External links * Category:2018 films Category:2018 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films ","title":"The Mountain (2018 film)"},{"id":"57993676","title":"Michel Noher"},{"id":"57993682","text":"Aillaud is a surname.

Many applications of metal materials require that they can maintain their structure and strength despite very high temperatures. Efforts to prevent deformations from long term stress, referred to as creep, consist of manipulating alloys to reduce coarsening and migration of individual grains within the metal. The small size of individual metal grains provides high interfacial surface energy which is what prompts coarsening, the increase in grain size, and eventually metallic softening. Nanocrystalline creep is considered to follow the Coble creep mechanism, the diffusion of atoms along grain boundaries at low stress levels and high temperatures. One method used to reduce coarsening, is by employing an alloy in which one component has good solubility with another. Since grain size decreases with high solute concentration, the rate of coarsening is slowed until inconsequential.  Copper and 10% Atomic Tantalum Nanocrystalline Alloy  In 2016, researchers at the Arizona State University and the US Army Research Laboratory reported a microstructurally stable nanocrystalline alloy made of copper and 10% atomic tantalum (Cu–10 at% Ta). This microstructurally stable nanocrystalline alloy demonstrated high creep resistance under an applied stress and temperature ranges 0.85 to 1.2% of the shear modulus and .5-.64Tm respectively, the steady creep rates were consistently less than 10−6 s−1. This stability was credited to the mechanistic creep process and the alloy’s core–shell-type structures. The scientists determined that the copper alloy creep occurred in dislocation climb areas under levels of relatively larger stress, claiming that any diffusion creep occurring was negligible. The core–shell-type nanostructures prevented coarsening by securing grain boundaries, a mechanism known as Zener pinning. In these structures more interfacial bonding interactions were possible, increasing strength. Oxide-dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic alloys16 and molybdenum alloys17’s great strength and ductility were also credited to these nanostructures.  Nickel and 13% Tungsten Nanocrystalline Alloy  In 2007, a nickel (Ni) and tungsten (W) nanocrystalline alloy was reported to have resistance to coarsening. Experimental data reported that the alloy coarsened to 28 nm from its original grain size of 20 nm after 30 minutes of exposure to heat of 600 degrees Celsius. This growth was then compared to the coarsening rate of an individual grain of Ni placed in heat of 300 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.  Tungsten and 20% Titanium Nanocrystalline Alloy  In 2012, a tungsten (W) and 20% titanium (Ti) nanocrystalline alloy after a week of exposure to heat of 1100 degrees Celsius in an argon atmosphere was claimed by the researchers to have displayed no change in grain size from the initial 20 nm. Meanwhile, the unalloyed W under the same conditions exhibited a final size on the micrometer scale. Another reviewer describes the coarsening of the W-Ti alloy to be a 2 nm size increase from the original 22 nm. The authors attribute the microstructural stability to a complex chemical arrangement. The nanocrystalline metallic grains were made via a high energy ball mill method.

Introduced by Senator Burton K. Wheeler (D-Montana), it recommended that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fix the maximum power used by AM broadcasting stations at 50,000 watts. Shortly thereafter the FCC formally adopted the suggested 50,000 watt cap, which still remains the limit. Background On June 9, 1938, Senator Wheeler submitted a resolution for consideration by the full body: At the time this resolution was introduced, FM and TV stations did not yet exist, and there were fewer than 700 AM stations, many struggling economically due to the effects of the Great Depression. In 1928, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission's (FRC) General Order 40, broadcasting stations had been divided into three main categories: \\"local\\", limited to 100 watts, \\"regional\\", limited to 1,000 watts, and \\"clear\\", generally capped at 50,000 watts. Subsequently, the daytime maximum for local stations had been raised to 250 watts, and to 5,000 watts for regional stations. Wheeler's resolution was related to the fact that the FCC was preparing to hold a series of hearing reviewing the future of the AM broadcasting band, including transmitting power levels. In 1938 there already was one station, WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, operating with significantly higher power than 50,000 watts. Beginning in 1934 WLW received a series of temporary authorizations to use 500,000 watts, moreover, the FCC had received applications from more than a dozen additional stations to start using powers above 50,000 watts.\\"Four Stations File For 500 kw. Power\\", Broadcasting, July 1, 1936, page 77. The prospect of numerous \\"superpower\\" stations made many lower powered stations concerned that they would be \\"drowned out\\" and unable to compete economically, which would lead to a reduction in the number of operating stations. Wheeler, an avid anti-monopolist, also warned that domination of the airwaves by high-powered stations could lead to the rise of a dictator like Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in Germany or Stalin in the Soviet Union, each of whom used control of radio broadcasting to aid their seizures of power.\\"Advertising on Radio Must Be Limited, Wheeler Warns\\", Washington Evening Star, December 11, 1938, page 1. Wheeler's Resolution 294 was adopted by the full senate on June 13. Although Senator Robert J. Bulkley (D-Ohio) entered a motion to reconsider the vote,\\"Radio Stations Broadcasting in Standard Band\\", Journal of the Senate of the United States of America (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 13, 1938, page 539. he withdrew the motion the next day.\\"Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations\\", Journal of the Senate of the United States of America (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 14, 1938, page 562. A resolution, unlike a law, was not binding on the FCC, however it was seen as having an important influence on the outcome of its hearings.\\"Revision of FCC Regulations Is Unlikely Before Next Year\\", Broadcasting, July 1, 1938, page 16. Impact After concluding the hearings, in early 1939 the FCC announced its new regulations, which narrowed the power differences between low and high-powered stations. Local stations could now use up to 250 watts at night, and regional stations 5,000 watts. On the other hand, in language that largely echoed the financial arguments of the Wheeler resolution, clear channel stations were still limited to 50,000 watts, and WLW's authorization to use 500,000 watts, except experimentally during early morning hours, was terminated.\\"Proposed New FCC Rules Well Received\\", Broadcasting, February 1, 1939, pages 16-17, 70-73. Although subsequently many AM stations in other countries, especially in Europe and Asia, would use far greater powers, in the United States the Wheeler resolution's 50,000 watt cap has remained in place.

The Reverend Kapya John Kaoma is currently the Rector at Christ Episcopal Church in Waltham, Massachusetts. Education and honors After having received a 1st class Bachelor of Theology at the Theological College of Central Africa in 1997, he went on to receive a Master of Arts at Trinity College, University of Bristol in 1998 and a Doctor of Theology at Boston University in 2010, where he also serves at Visiting Researcher. Kaoma has received several honors and scholarships, including the 2014 International Human Rights Award of the Lesbian and Gay Association Mexico City. Activism Kapya Kaoma was the first scholar to expose ties between fundamentalist anti-gay Christian groups from the US and the recent increase of postcolonial anti-gay legislation in Africa. His two publications \\"Globalizing the Culture Wars\\" and \\"Colonizing African values\\" have been influential in understanding anti-LGBTQ politics in Africa and beyond. Examples include Scott Lively, whose \\"Abiding Truth Ministries\\" has had extensive media coverage and political attention in Uganda, shortly after which Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni signed into law an anti-gay bill deemed to be one of the most repressive in current history.Kaoma, Kapya (May 2012). \\"Exporting the Anti-Gay Movement\\". The American Prospect 23 (4). Since 2009, Kaoma has published widely on the issues of cultural neo-colonialism, with particular attention on how conservative religious anti-LGBTQ+ ideology is increasingly taking root in many African societies-leading to militant opposition to sexual minorities. Kaoma spoke at The United Nations in 2009 and 2014 respectivelyThe United Nations\\"> on the plight of the LGBTI community in Africa. In 2010, Kaoma testified before the United States Congress' Tom Lantos-Human Rights Commission on Uganda's anti-homosexuality Bill. Kaoma was Senior Research Analyst for Political Research Associates, a national think tank based in Somerville, Massachusetts.\\" Kaoma has written for the Huffington Post,Religion Dispatches, Los Angeles Times, and the Zambian news outlet Lusaka Times. In addition to providing commentary on anti-LGBTQ+ ideology in Africa, Kaoma's works have been highly cited by many media outlets including The New York Times, The Economist Magazine, Time, The Associated Press and Mother Jones. Kaoma's research played a critical role in a historic lawsuit filled by Sexual Minorities Uganda against Scott Lively in the U.S. Courts. As a factual witness, Kaoma was subpoenaed by the United States District Court to testify in a deposition in Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) v. Scott Lively case in 2015. On June 5, 2017, Judge Michael Ponsor of the U.S. District Court in Springfield, Massachusetts, dismissed the SMUG case on jurisdictional grounds. In his dismissal, however, he wrote, “Anyone reading this memorandum should make no mistake. The question before the court is not whether Defendant’s actions in aiding and abetting efforts to demonize, intimidate, and injure LGBT people in Uganda constitute violations of international law. They do.” Lively's lawyers appealed the ruling, but the court upheld it on August 10, 2018. Writing with theologians Gerald West and Charlene van der Walt, Kaoma joined in challenging traditional church teachings on sex and marriage, writing that “Sexuality has become a new site of struggle and the ‘old’ theology does not fit, for it is founded on heteropatriarchy.” When Faith Does Violence: Re-Imagining Engagement between Churches and LGBTI Group on Homophobia in Africa, by Gerald West, Charlene van der Walt, and Kapya John Kaoma, HTS: Theological Studies, 2016 .

It was designed by John Whitton and Dept of Railways and built from 1883 to 1885 by C. and E. Millar. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  = Oatley = Old Como railway bridge now used as pedestrian bridge Oatley was named after a man who never lived in the area. James Oatley (1770–1839) a convict clock maker arrived in the colony on 27 January 1815 to serve a life sentence. The clock at Hyde Park Barracks, built between 1817–19, included a clock made by Oatley. When he was pardoned, he received several land grants. One, granted in 1833, was near the George's River. He called the property Needwood Forest, after woodlands in his native Warwickshire in England. Oatley never built on the land, but lived on a farm called Snugsborough near Beverly Hills. It stood in a grant received in 1831. He died in 1839, and was buried at Snugsborough, where his grave was found in 1921. Needwood Forest passed to Frederick, his third son, who sold it to Charles Cecil Griffiths in 1881. The property extended from Gungah Bay on the suburb's western edge, to the later Boundary and Hurstville Roads. When the Hurstville to Sutherland railway line passed through Oatley's old property in the 1880s, the station, opened in 1886, took his name, as did Oatley Bay and Oatley Park, a favourite picnic spot for local residents. = Bridge = The Old Como railway bridge was completed in 1885 as a part of the original Illawarra railway line infrastructure. It is a very fine example of a single track steel lattice girder bridge of the 1870s and 1880s. Como is the longest single track steel lattice girder bridge in NSW and the only such bridge within of Sydney. It was a notorious bottleneck within five years of its completion when the single track on either side of the bridge was increased to a double track. The double tracks converged to a single \\"gauntlet track\\" on the bridge, which enabled trains to cross in either direction without chain points and with a relative degree of safety. It was one of only a few installations of this type in NSW. = Sydney Water = Between 1935 and 1942, the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board built a new diameter pipeline to pump water from the recently completed Woronora Dam to the Board's reservoirs at Penshurst. The pipeline was carried over the Georges River on the Como railway bridge, supported on new steel outriggers cantilevered from the main girders. To maintain an evenly balanced load, the pipeline was split into two diameter mains, one supported on each side of the bridge. The old Como railway bridge was finally superseded in 1972 by a new double track reinforced concrete bridge, built alongside the existing bridge. Responsibility for the old bridge was transferred to the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board, now Sydney Water. Sutherland and Georges River Councils, the local authorities on either side of the river, shared the cost of converting the railway track to an extensively used cycleway and footpath, which opened in 1985, 100 years after the construction of the bridge. In the late 1990s, Sydney Water undertook upgrading works to the pipeline and maintenance gantries to repair leaks and comply with current OH & S requirements.  Description  An iron lattice girder bridge. Formerly a rail bridge. Sydney Water has had a sewerage pipeline running across the bridge for many years. The railway infrastructure has been removed from the deck and the bridge deck is used as a pedestrian bridge over the Georges River. Rail infrastructure removed from the bridge deck and replaced with bitumen footway. = Modifications and dates = *1926 - transverse elliptical arch braces raised to support electrical catenary *1935-42 - Woronora to Penshurst 48 inch water main installed across bridge *1985 - Removal of rail infrastructure and conversion to footbridge/cycleway *2003 - removal of timber walkway planks adjacent to the pipeline and the steel handrails.  Heritage listing  As of November 2018, the Como Rail bridge is significant as the longest single track lattice girder bridge in New South Wales and is a rare example of this type. Historically, the bridge contributed to the opening up of the southern suburbs of Sydney in the 1880s. While the rail infrastructure has largely been removed from the bridge, it continues to serve an important function, supporting the Woronora to Penshurst Water Supply Pipeline, part of Sydney's fifth water supply system. It also provides an important pedestrian link across the Georges River. The Old Como railway bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Old Como railway bridge is one of Whitton's 12 original lattice wrought iron girder bridges and is of high significance and visibility in the surrounding area. It is a major structure in the area and indicates clearly the level of design and technology involved in early railway construction to cross a major river. The bridge is a very fine example of a single track steel lattice girder bridge of the 1870s and 1880s. Como is the longest single track steel lattice girder bridge in NSW and the only such bridge within of Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge is the older of two important man-made elements in a scenic estuarine landscape, contrasting with the strong natural quality of the environs. The simple, rugged quality of the engineering contrasts with the Australian bush, cliff and shore settings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The bridge was a part of a major transport link between the South Coast and Sydney, encouraging development in the towns and suburbs which emerged along the railway line. The presence of the railway line encouraged Sydney day-trippers to use the Como boatsheds, baths, fishing locations and the adjacent National Park. The bridge continues in service as an important pedestrian and bicycle link across the Georges River. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is the only rail bridge of this style within of Sydney and was one of a group of twelve constructed in the 1880s. The survival status of the remaining 11 bridges has not been investigated.

Education and career Mettler received a B.A. from Boston College in 1984, a Masters from the University of Illinois (Urbana) in political science, 1989, and a Ph.D. from Cornell University in government, 1994. From 1994 to 2007 she taught at Syracuse University, rising from assistant professor to full professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Department of Political Science. Since July, 2007, she has been the Clinton Rossiter Professor of American Institutions, Department of Government, Cornell University. Works Mettler co-edited the Oxford Handbook of American Political Development (2016). Mettler subscribes to the subfield of political science called American political development (APD), which recognizes the need for an analytic approach to researching and understanding U.S. politics. She feels there is a distinctiveness of the APD approach, which studies \\"the causes, nature, and consequences of key transformative periods and central patterns in American political history,\\" as well the \\"durable shifts in governing authority\\" in the United States. Mettler has been described as a prominent Americanist scholar in this relatively new field, which blurs the border between political science and political history. Her particular interests include inequality, democratization and civic engagement. She has written five books, most prominently two winners of the Kammerer Award of the American Political Science Association for the best book on U.S. national policy: Soldiers to Citizens: The G.I. Bill and the Making of the Greatest Generation, 2005 (Oxford University Press), and Dividing Citizens: Gender and Federalism in New Deal Public Policy, 1998 (Cornell University Press), which also won the Greenstone Book Prize and the Martha Dertick Book Award.

During his term of office the colony was raided first by the English and then by the Dutch. Family Cyprien Lefebvre was born on 16 December 1643. His father was Antoine Lefebvre (died 1669), sieur de la Barre, a counselor in parliament and provost of the merchants of Paris. His mother was Madeleine Belin. His eldest brother was Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre (1622–1688), governor of Cayenne from May 1664 to June 1665. In 1665 the French Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert commissioned Antoine Lefebvre de La Barre as the king's governor of the American Mainland. He was later governor of Cayenne for the king from 1668 to 1670 and governor general of New France from 1682 to 1685. The family dynasty ended with Antoine's son, François Lefebvre de La Barre, who was governor of Cayenne from 1687 until his death in 1691. First term of office (1665–67) Antoine Lefebvre left Cayenne for France in 1665 and obtained the appointment of Cyprien as governor from the newly created Royal West Indies Company (Compagnie Royale des Indes Occidentales). Cyprien Lefebvre was governor of Cayenne from 1665 to 1668. He replaced the acting governor Antoine de Noël de la Trompe d'Or, who left office on 8 September 1655. On 20 June 1665 Lefebvre ceded a property in Cayenne to Joseph-Fortuné Pignon, vicomte de Quincy. This became the property of the Jesuits in 1668 and their base in the colony. In 1666 the English commanded by Captain Peter Wroth visited the colony of Cayenne but did not harm Lefèvre. Cayenne was looted by the British under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman in August 1667. The English destroyed Fort Cépérou and the town of Cayenne. Lefebvre left on 23 September 1667. From December 1667 the Jesuit father Jean Morellet was the de facto governor. After peace was restored in 1668 Lefebvre's brother Joseph-Antoine de La Barre returned, and held office until 1670. Second term of office (1670–79) Cyprien Lefebvre again took charge of Cayenne in 1670, and held office until March 1679. He was commander from 1670 to 1675, then governor from 1675 to 1679. On 21 May 1671 he was received as a Knight of Malta and made a lieutenant general. He was governor of the French West India Company in 1674, when its possessions were returned to the king. In the spring of 1676 the Dutch captain Jacob Binckes was promoted to vice-admiral and dispatched to the West Indies with a fleet of seven men of war and six other ships. He arrived at Cayenne on 4 May 1676 and landed 900 troops near Fort Saint Louis (Fort Cépérou) the next day. Lefebvre soon surrendered. Binckes left shortly after for Marie-Galante and Tobago, leaving a small force to hold Cayenne. The Dutch commander Binkes controlled the colony from 5 May 1676 to 20 December 1676. The Dutch left in December, defeated by the Comte Jean II d'Estrées. In 1679 Lefebvre was replaced as governor by Pierre-Eléonore de La Ville, marquis de Férolles.

Her work was invaluable in recording the cultural and social practices of people in Cambridgeshire; she was innovative in the discipline of social history collection, employing working practices such as oral history, and engaging with people in areas that had previously been overlooked by folklorists.Carmen Blacker, in Women and Tradition, ed. Hilda Davidson and Carmen Blacker (Carolina Academic Press, 2001) Her notebooks, now in possession of the Museum of Cambridge, hold a treasure-trove of information about Cambridgeshire customs, stories and songs. Early life Enid Mary Porter was born on 8 October 1908 in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, to father Hugh Porter and mother Ethel Mary Porter. Her father Hugh, originally from Bedford, completed his teacher training at a higher-grade school in Cambridge before becoming a secondary master at Southend High School. Her mother, Ethel Mary (née Scott), was from a family which could trace its roots in Cambridge as far back as the seventeenth century. As a result Enid regularly visited relatives in the city of Cambridge and knew the area well. In her later career she would record local lore gleaned from her Cambridgeshire family. The Porter family was of the professional middle class and employed a servant until the First World War. After obtaining a degree in modern languages at University College London (which at this time housed the Folklore Society library, deposited in 1911), Enid followed her father and trained as a teacher, working in schools for some years until after the Second World War. Her true interests however, lay outside teaching, and seeing a staff vacancy advertised at the Cambridge and County Folk Museum in 1947, she applied and was appointed Assistant Curator in September of that year. Career =Curatorship at the Museum of Cambridge= The museum grew out of the 1934 ‘Festival of Olden Times’ hosted by the Cambridge Guildhall and organised by Catherine Parsons, the then chair of the Cambridgeshire Women's Institute. Museum of Cambridge Website The Museum was formed in 1936 by members of the local Rotary Club and University of Cambridge, in the site of the abandoned White Horse Inn; the museum occupies the same site today. The original aim of the museum was ‘to collect and preserve for the benefit of the general public and for the purposes of education, objects of local interest and common use’.Cambridge and County Folk Museum 1st Annual Report, 21 December 1936 During the official opening of the museum, Sir Cyril Fox proclaimed ‘I am inclined to think that in the University of Cambridge there is more exact knowledge of the social anthropology of, let us say, Pupua than of Pampisford’; the Museum of Cambridge has retained its original purpose to collect, preserve and educate the public about a history of Cambridgeshire, separate from the University. Enid Porter was appointed assistant curator under honorary curator Thomas Wyatt Bagshawe in 1947 and became full curator in 1950, living in rooms connected to the old Inn. The museum was in a poor financial position surviving on a combination of subscriptions, donations, admission fees (3d for children and 6d for adults). Enid worked as ticket collector and cleaner, as well as curator; in 1965, she only earnt £8 a week and hadn't had a pay rise in fifteen years. During the 1960s, Porter had transformed the museum into a community hub and visitor numbers steadily rose throughout the decade. Enid's health began to decline in the 1960s and she retired in 1974 after a series of heart attacks. =Collection of folklore= Wooden Nutcracker, handmade in Ely in the late 18th century. Purchased by Enid Porter at a sale by auction on 7 & 8 April 1964, Drill Hall, Ely. The collection of the Museum of Cambridge grew vastly during Enid Porter's curatorship; she accepted donations and regularly went to auctions to buy items for the museum. The museum's collection now comprises over 20,000 objects not including Porter's personal notebooks. These notebooks contained copies of historical documents, newspaper articles and trade directories that she used to track movements of individuals, businesses and buildings. Porter's notebooks are also home to accounts of numerous encounters with people she met during her professional life, detailing certain folk customs and superstitions and song lyrics. Some of her notes and transcriptions have been digitised by the Enid Porter Project run by the Museum of Cambridge and can be seen on the project website. Her collection of material in The Fens, the rural northern areas of Cambridgeshire, brought her into contact with W.H. Barrett with whom she published Tales from the Fens (1963), and More Tales from the Fens (1964). Years before a methodology was standardised for oral history collection, Porter engaged with people from all over the region, collecting stories, anecdotes and valuable personal feelings and impressions of interviewees. Porter preferred to use her notebooks as she felt that contemporary recording equipment affected the interviewees negatively and spoilt the material. Although some of these methods would have been considered unempirical by academic historians, they were recognised when the University of Cambridge awarded her an honorary MA in 1972, followed by the same degree from the Open University in 1980.Jacqueline Simpson and Steve Roud, A Dictionary of English Folklore (Oxford University Press, 2003) In 2015 a Cambridge blue plaque was installed at the Museum of Cambridge bearing her name. Personal philosophy Enid Porter was influential within the museums movement of the 1960s which aimed to widen museum attendance and to discourage elitist tendencies in the sector. She gave talks about local history to all sorts of groups and published articles in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdon & Peterborough Life magazine. Porter never missed an opportunity, and even took note of conversations she held when she was in hospital for her own health, sharing stories and anecdotes with other patients nearby. These methods of collection are a consequence of the key philosophy that she thanks her predecessor Thomas Bagshawe for; the importance of going out to collect information rather than sitting and waiting for it to be brought to the museum or the curator. Enid Porter worked using a multi-disciplinary method in her collection of folklore, social history and community life. She wrote that ‘Just as no man is an island unto himself, no academic discipline should, or can, remain in isolation’.Curator's Notebooks, Museum of Cambridge Archive Works * Cambridgeshire Customs & Folklore (London: Routledge & Keegan Paul, 1969) * The Folklore of East Anglia (London: B.T.

Murder of Richard Dvorak  On Wednesday, June 13, 1973, a gendarme patrol discovered on the roadside of the Süd Autobahn near a bridge in the Guntramsdorf district a wide crater with bone splinters and body parts. The authorities' first suspicions was directed towards an active gang of burglars, which opened safes with explosives and in the last two weeks had three successful slams in Lower Austria. The investigators assumed that perhaps one of the gang members had suffered an accident with the explosives or had been killed in this way by his accomplices. A second theory was that someone had planned an attack on a bus transport full of Jewish emigrants to the transit camp Schloss Schönau, but had blown himself up by improper handling. The police suspected several times that the perpetrator was Emmanuel K., who had been released just under four months earlier from prison and was considered to be untraceable. Finally on June 15, the deceased was identified. It was 30-year-old family man Richard Dvorak, a contract agent working for Vienna City Hall. His mother provided the crucial clues that led to his identification. Ernst Dostal, who was considered a close friend of Dvorak, was first questioned about the homicide on June 18 and stated that he had not seen Dvorak for days.  Rampage in Rennweg barracks  On Friday, June 22, Dostal was again invited for questioning on Richard Dvorak in the Rennweg barracks in Vienna. Because he was not considered a suspect, he was not searched. When Dostal testified that he had been to a certain inn during the night, but the officials pointed out that it was closed at the time, he suddenly reached into jacket's pockets and began firing at the officers from two hidden pistols. The officers Ottokar Pücher (38), Matthias Horvath (42) and Harald Syrinek (48) were hit and severely injured; Pücher and Syrinek were in critical condition for days after. In an attempt to escape from the building, he wounded 57-year- old civil servant Leopold Ullrich with a shot to the stomach before he finally escaped by jumping from a window on the first floor. He carjacked a passing car and continued his escape to the South Tyrolean square.  Manhunt and double murder  Immediately after the incident, the Dostals' house in Tullnerbach, their farm near Ober-Grafendorf and a rented apartment in Vienna were searched, whereby the gendarmes found a substantial collection of weapons. On the farm, the officers also found a soundproof torture chamber with stretched beds and necklaces next to a wooden human figure which was shot on, with targets and mountains of empty shell casings. Even Robert Dostal, Ernst's father, had submerged before the killing spree and was now sought by arrest warrant. On Sunday morning Ernst Dostal shot the couple Viktor (45) and Johanna Steiger (43) in the weekend house in Sachsengang, where he was observed by a neighbour. The police assumed that Dostal had already broken into the couple's weekend home from Vienna-Döbling on Saturday and stayed there overnight. On Monday morning, a coordination center was set up in the Interior Ministry of Vienna, in which all information about Dostal was collected. A radio journal service, which could receive 200 radio conversations with all the individual patrol cars at the same time, evaluated the messages and directed emergency vehicles to the locations. The Federal Army provided special maps of Lower Austria, on which the security authorities could locate and track every possible escape route. Later that same day, the \\"Suburban Line Action\\" was set in motion; safety chains were set up on all the entry and exit roads from Vienna to Lower Austria and vice versa, and every vehicle was inspected. Traffic control stations were also located in the surrounding districts of Vienna. Dostal's crimes had triggered the largest manhunt in the history of the Second Republic.  Suicide  The attempt to contact his father with an encrypted newspaper advertisement revealed his whereabouts: '1919, Monday waited in vain on the tower for you, I will try Wednesday and Thursday at 10 o'clock again. Am currently on 02774/326 reach.\\" Since 1919 is the year of birth's Dostal's father and the homeowner of the associated phone number stated that he had not give up the ad, special units surrounded the Altlengbach property on Tuesday and stormed it using tear gas. Although the property was deserted, Dostal's escape car was in the garage. Dostal himself, however, was shortly observed leaving a nearby property. After a short firefight, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. Subsequent investigations revealed that Dvorak and Dostal were planning a kidnapping series together. When Dvorak wanted to back out, Dostal shot him and blew up his body, hiding his clothes and bones to make identification impossible and making the investigation more difficult. Dostal's father Robert, who was also involved in the crime, traveled to Switzerland after his son's escape and then to Lüneberg in Germany, where he also committed suicide by shooting himself in a hotel room. Officer Ottokar Pücher, who was injured in the Rennweger barracks by Dostal with a shot to the neck, remained paralyzed from his neck down until his death in 2010.

It is part of the command structure of the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan.  History of Azerbaijani military bands  In the early days of the establishment of the Azerbaijani National Army of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, a military band was created in a short period of time. The first military parade in Baku in 1919 was accompanied by a military band.https://ordu.az/az/news/150206/herbi-orkestr,-musiqili- intizam,-azerbaycan-herb-musiqisi-seneti Military bands have always existed in the history of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. During Yusif Akhundzade's service as director of the school band of the Caspian Higher Naval School (later known as the Azerbaijan Higher Naval Academy), it participated in the 1971 and 1983 October Revolution Day Parade on Moscow's Red Square. In 1971, the band's performance on Kutuzovsky Prospekt featured the famous Azeri march Vatan by composer Alimardan Aliyev, which was one of the few times oriental music was played at a military parade in Moscow.https://ordu.az/az/news/151603/herbi-orkestr-xidmetinin-reisi-tezlikle- qelebe-uverturasini-seslendireceyik-musahibe+fotolar A band was also maintained in the Baku Higher Combined Arms Command School. A band during the 2018 International Army Games. = Foundation of the service = On the basis of the bands of the Baku Garrison, Transcaucasian Military District of the Soviet Armed Forces, the military band service was founded on 1 July 1992 by order of the Minister of Defense Rahim Gaziyev. The debut performance of the units of the band service was on 9 October 1992 during the Day of the Armed Forces parade on Azadliq Square. Being a young unit, it needed to get specially designed uniforms for the parade. This was the result of having to wear military uniforms left over from the Soviet Army. During preparations for the state visit of President of Turkey Turgut Özal, the military attache of the Turkish embassy in Baku entered the band training hall, to which he was disappointed in the uniforms of musicians, with the Turkish Army sending parade uniforms and musical instruments sometime later.https://azertag.az/xeber/Yusif_Axundzade_Resmi_qarsilanma_merasimlerinde_dovletlerin_himnlerini_notsuz_ifa_etmeyimiz_her_zaman_teeccuble_qarsilanib-1096010 President Heydar Aliyev supervised the training of national cadres in the band and the training of military music specialists. In the first years of the formation of the service, the soloists of the exemplary band took part in the farewell ceremonies of the personnel going to the battle in the Nagorno- Karabakh War. In the 90s, military bands in the Land Forces, Air Force and Navy, as well as special educational institutions were created.  Composition  The band performing the fanfare of the President of Azerbaijan The Band of the State Border Service of Azerbaijan with its leader, A.

Preparation for these events generally takes three to four days for the band. The President of Afghanistan Ashraf Ghani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have given their own personal greetings to members of the band. It has visited 50 countries. It is notable for organizing its performances without notes, but through memorization. Band of the Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy The Band of the Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy is a 52-member military band that serves as part of the Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy (AAHA). The band was formed on 15 February 1992 and is one of the leading military ensembles in Azerbaijan.

She is a painter and sculptor.  Biography  Jusionyte was born in Klaipėda and studied in the Vilnius Academy of Arts. In 2000 she left Lithuania for Paris and works and resides there. She has been holding solo and group exhibitions since 2003. Her works are held in public and private collections. She is the daughter of the prominent Lithuanian painter Algimantas Jusionis.  Work  Jusionyte is a figurative Expressionist. Unlike much 20th century and more recent Expressionism, her work does not primarily focus on angst and fragmentation, but can be seen as an affirmation, and a positive representation, of our humanity. As journalist and art reviewer Florence Millioud-Henriques has written, reviewing an exhibition at Galerie Univers in Lausanne: \\"There is the mermaid and the man, the couple and the carp, the woman and the parrot, the rabbit and the woman. All have in common the desire to share, to touch, to protect, to wrap themselves in the same universal tenderness and all seem to find a reason to exist in this harmonious equity of kingdoms, genders and sexes.\\" And the French philosopher and Art historian Christian Noorbergen has written of her art that it \\"exults wild health, and the immense weight of devouring life.\\" Her paintings and sculptures are characterised by an emotive, gestural and lyrical technique, in either oil paint or terracotta, which links her stylistically to European Expressionism. She also produces sculptures in bronze. Recent paintings demonstrate an increasing interest in atmosphere and dramatic lighting. Her subject matter ranges from human beings, expressive of bravery, confidence or fragility, and therianthropic or animal-human hybrid beings used as metaphors for the human condition. Her work is redolent of myths, fairy tales and Jungian archetypes, though with an emphasis on women's experience. Personal experiences are also imaginatively recast as ambiguous and at times unsettling narratives though, as with an artist like Paula Rego, humour and a subtle irony are also often present. Her work expresses an emotional tenderness that is distinct from much recent European art in an Expressionist mode. In an interview for online art daily echogonewrong with art writer Agnė Sadauskaitė, the artist has stated \\"This foundation, woman and man and their relationship, arises in my work, in sculptures or paintings. It could represent the issue of equality, or questions put to each other, who you are, how I will interact with you, what we will give each other. The psychologist Carl Gustav Jung states that we have femininity and masculinity (anima and animus) in ourselves, and over the years, masculinity grows stronger in women, and vice versa. In my work, there is a reflection on two sides in one person\\" Her interest in hybridisation has been remarked upon by French historian Thierry Delcourt: \\"She aims to extract a composite figure, acting as its roiling, turbulent transmitter. Like Germaine Richier and Gérard Garouste, she unfolds and unfurls her own matrix, teeming with her own culture and imagination. Words, things, and shapes collide, enabling her to produce hybrid figures that are on occasion misshapen from being underpinned by the richness of what produced them. Dreams give us an occasionally nightmarish foretaste, like the figures of Hieronymous Bosch or Goya’s Caprichos. It may well be the case that these avatars – polymorphic, spiritual monsters – are a better, truer rendition of humanity than Romantic figures stripped of ambiguity and the play of polysemy.\\"  Awards  In 2015 Jusionyte was awarded the Georges Coulon prize for figurative sculpture at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts .  Collections  Her sculptures and paintings are in public collections and museums such as M. K. Čiurlionis National Art Museum, Modern Art Museum Vilnius, Museum of Angels Vilnius and Lebwen Fondation in Lithuania, and the collections of the city of Mans and Pithiviers, France.

They were designed and built during 1895 by the NSW Public Works Department. The reservoirs are also known as WS87 & R88, Penshurst Elevated Steel Reservoir No 2 and Penshurst Elevated Concrete Reservoir No 3. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The site was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  In 1891 a cast iron elevated tank was constructed at Penshurst. Only the brick stand still survives. It was supplied with Upper Nepean Scheme water by a pumping station at Carlton. To augment supply, Penshurst Reservoir No. 1, a riveted steel surface reservoir, was constructed in 1895. By 1910, further growth in demand was met with the construction of the elevated Penshurst Reservoir No. 2 (WS87), a riveted steel elevated reservoir. Penshurst Tank was removed in 1914, first to Campbelltown and, in 1942, to Warragamba Township. The fourth reservoir, the elevated Penshurst Reservoir No. 3 (WS88), a large concrete elevated reservoir, was constructed in 1938. The elevated Penshurst Reservoir (WS87), built in 1910, is one of a group of four similar elevated reservoirs, the others being Bellevue Hill Reservoir (WS10), Drummoyne Reservoir (WS38), completed in 1910, and Ashfield Reservoir (WS3), completed in 1912. In the meantime, Lakemba Pumping Station took over supply for Penshurst in 1924, but also supplied Wiley Park and East Hills from 1930. Carlton pumping station continued in emergency service until decommissioned in 1939. Penshurst Reservoir No. 1 was removed in 1951 and re-erected at Newport. With plans to extend the Woronora Pipeline to the Metropolitan System, a Main was commenced in 1958 from Penshurst to Allawah. However, by 1961, it was realised that instead of Woronora supplying Sydney, the opposite would be the case, with Warragamba water supplementing areas supplied by Woronora. This situation required further amplification of the mains between the City Tunnel at Ashfield and the Penshurst Reservoirs, including a new main from the City Tunnel to Allawah, pumped by a new pumping station in Canterbury Park, together with a pumping station at Allawah to pump water to Penshurst. Completion of this scheme in 1969 allowed Warragamba water to be fed into the Woronora Pipeline in sufficient quantity to assist in the supply of Sutherland, Cronulla and beyond.  Description  Penshurst Reservoir (WS87) is one of a group of four similar elevated reservoirs, the others being Bellevue Hill Reservoir (WS10), erected in 1910, Drummoyne Reservoir (WS38),erected in 1910, and Ashfield Reservoir (WS3), erected in 1912. Each reservoir is an elevated cylindrical riveted steel tank, resting on a concrete apron and supported on a steel girder frame. The perimeter of the steel stand has a façade of concrete columns and arches, which forms a decorative, rather than a structural feature. The walkway around the rim of the reservoir has been removed. Standard features include a handrail in tubular steel, davit, access ladder, depth gauge board, inlet and outlet valve chambers. The full service level is and the reservoir has a capacity of . The Penshurst Reservoir Site also includes the former Water Service Officer's Cottage, the concrete base of Penshurst Reservoir No. 1, the brick stand for Penshurst Tank (1891), valves and pipework associated with the connection in 1942 of the Woronora supply with Upper Nepean System water and a number of skid huts (3 in total). Significant plantings around the site include cypress, viburnum, jacaranda, camphor laurel, oleander and native species. = Modifications and dates = The reservoir has been roofed to safeguard water quality (1977).  Heritage listing  As at 2 May 2005, the Penshurst Reservoirs (WS87 and WS88) are one of a small group of four similar elevated reservoirs in the Sydney Water system, the others being Bellevue Hill Reservoir (WS10), erected in 1910, Drummoyne Reservoir (WS38), erected in 1910, and the Ashfield Reservoir (WS 3), erected in 1912. The group of reservoirs demonstrates a high level of engineering expertise and architectural detail, accommodating both structural requirements and aesthetic qualities. Penshurst Reservoirs and Site demonstrates the rapid growth in demand for water in Sydney's southern suburbs as well as exhibiting a wide range of reservoir construction technology. It is the key site connecting Woronora and Warragamba water supply since 1942. The site has been in continuous use for water supply since 1891, over 100 years. Penshurst Reservoir (WS88) is the largest elevated reinforced concrete reservoir in the Sydney Water Supply System. Penshurst Reservoirs was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

The Castle has been built during the Carolingian Empire on top of Mountain Penna. In the same area, traces of an Etrurian settlement are to be found. History The dominant position of the Castle on top of the Mountain Penna provided good protection in the ancient times. The surrounding valley, with fertile grounds allowed a rich development of agricultural techniques. In more recent times, the Lake Trasimeno nearby, a major touristic site, has long provided attraction to this place. The Montesperello castle has always played a major role with numerous sieges, conquests and battles. Traces of the Etrurian settlement on the site date back to 210-214 BC. The several Etruscan cinerary urns were found in the walls of two houses located within the area of the Castle and along the hill in the 19th century. Among these there is one of particular interest, with a Medusa head carved. After the Roman conquest of the entire Italian peninsula, defensive needs declined. There was a rural settlement, with farms scattered near or in the middle of the fields. After the imperial period, barbarian invasions followed, and, above all, the conquest of Longobard, greatly revived defensive needs. Monte Sperello was part of the Byzantine line of defense against the Longobard attack, developed by the military administration of Perugia. In 608, Bernardo Montesperli founded here a villa, which at first did not have a boundary wall. It became the core of the castle in the future. The Montesperello family was one of the oldest in the city of Perugia, subjects of the family can be identified by documents of 12th century. With the creation of the Carolingian Empire, the area Monte Sperello became an imperial property. So in 997 it was donated by emperor Ottone III to the Benedictine monastery of (today the Capolona in the province of Arezzo). He made it by the request of Hugh the Great, abbot and margrave of Tuscany. In the 10th century the creation of the city commune began. The nobility consortium, as a rule, included feudalism, and not from the point of view of a violent but peaceful conquest. In 1282 the villa Montesperello had 30 inhabitants, and 24 in 1410. In 1380 the castle was destroyed, returning to the state of a simple villa. In 1439 the castle was rebuilt at the expense of Perugia which considered Montesperello one of its defensive landmarks towards the Trasimeno and the Arezzo area. During this century the St. Christopher's church was built outside the wall. After the war of 1479 between Florence and the Papal State the castle was almost destroyed. In 1495, was the last reconstruction according to the appearance of firearms. In the 19th century Castello di Montesperello was renovated. Now it is a residential villa, which owned by the Pesciarelli family. Architecture The building has a hotel occupying 3 buildings, which has 130 rooms, which gives 30-40 apartments.Features, official website In the basements of the houses of the castle there is a secret passage that, crossing them, leads to the outside of the walls. This is an escape route in case of siege of the fortress for the owners of these houses. According to what was reported in the 15th century land registers, these were all members of the Montesperelli family. A few meters north of the church of San Cristoforo, in a building of modern residential buildings, there is an entrance to the cave. Inhabitants jokingly call it \\"Cave of the Mysteries\\" (it. Grotta dei Misteri). The cave has a staircase and an area of several meters. In fact, its original function remains obscure. Among the various possible solutions, two are the most likely ones: an Etrurian tomb, a simple cellar, or a tomb later used as a cellar. On the wall there is the inscription engraved indicating the year 1628: this could correspond to the date of discovery of a tomb or to the date of excavation of an underground cellar. St. Christopher's Church To the castle adjoins the parish church of St. Christopher of Montesperello (), located outside the castle walls and having an external bell tower. It was registered in Liber beneficiorum in 1350, rebuilt in 1400–1450 years. The belfry in its present form refers to 1797. At the beginning of the 1930s, in place of the sacristy a chapel was built, dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi. There are three paintings by artist Tedeschi Tito, which depict St. Francis, and buildings located in Assisi and Montesperello. July 3, 1949, the painter Gerardo Dottori completed the decoration of the church's apse with 3 frescoes. It is a triptych dedicated to St. Christopher, which includes the conversion of the Saint, the carrying Jesus and the martyrdom of the Saint. Surrounding neighborhood A few kilometers to the west is the national resort of Lake Trasimeno. At 1 km to the north-east, at the foot of the hill, is the Autodromo dell'Umbria, an operating automobile and motorcycle circuit of the national level. The national airport Montemelino is 3 km to the east. At the bottom of the southern slope is the winery Cantina Berioli, surrounded by vineyards; there are meetings of winemakers in the region and wine-making events are held.

In prison, he killed a convicted murderer and from then was designated as one of Austria's most dangerous offenders. In 2001 he died under much discussed circumstances on a belt bed in Stein Prison.  Murders  In the night of 15 to 16 April 1968, Karl shot the two burglars Walter P. and Johann Kihsl in the garage of the Tivoli department store in Vienna-Meidling. He claimed to have watched the two men enter the garage during his patrol duty and followed to confront them. However, when they noticed him, they are said to have shot at him, whereupon he only returned fire in self-defense. However, since the two men were killed with seven shots from close range, including headshots, the investigators did not believe the self-defense story and interrogated Karl. Since two friends of Kihsl testified that he had been to a policeman who had given him a gun and betrayed the most appropriate time for a robbery, a comparison was carried out, where they identified Ernst Karl. Only after a long and stubborn interrogation Karl confessed to have intentionally shot the burglars as they blackmailed him. He had known them for some time and they extorted him for his alleged homosexuality (at the time this was a criminal offence for which you could server from one to five years in Austria), where he paid them several times large amounts of hush money. However, as they demanded more and Karl had now made himself a criminal by giving them money, he proposed them a burglary in the Tivoli, where he promised them to stand outside in uniform, because he had service that night. After the men entered the garage, he followed them, persuaded them to turn around and killed them. After shooting them in the head, he took the gun he had given Kihsl he knew was carrying with him, firing a shot at it to bolster the self-defense situation later. Karl was sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders and transferred to the Stein Prison. There on January 15, 1974, he strangled with his bare hands 41-year-old convicted murderer Johann Rogatsch in the detention center's recreation room. He claimed to have acted in self-defense, because Rogatsch wanted to force him into a prison outbreak and then attacked. After this incident, he was transferred to a special detention center housing only the most dangerous criminals of the prison, at the time only seven inmates.  Death  Ernst Karl began to suffer more and more from schizophrenia and was plagued by psychotic breaks. He believed he was being shot at by the other cells, being followed by criminal gangs and still working as a police officer. Because of this, he was treated psychiatrically and medically. On June 14, 2001, he had another psychotic episode occurred, devastating his cell and breaking his nose. The on-duty in-house doctor, Dr. Stippler, then administered biperiden on him and ordered for him to be accommodated in a specially secured room and protect him from possible self-injury at the hospital's belt bed. Although judicial officials testified to having carried out checks every half hour, in which Ernst Karl slept peacefully, he was dead the next morning. He died as a result of an ileus and was pronounced dead at 7:55. The photos of the pale and lifeless prisoner to the bed, which had run out of blood from his nose and mouth, came to the public's attention and together with the fact that belt beds were banned for the detention of prisoners since 1994, caused fierce public protests.  Legal work-up  As a result, it turned out that the bed was not a belt bed as a special security measure according to Art. 103 of the Penal Code according to the legislation before 1994, but a sickbed to which Karl was put for self-protection as part of a medical psychiatric experiment as a treatment measure to the prisoner under the same conditions as other free prisoners. Such a stay in a medical bed with possibility of fixation, therefore, if it is necessary from a medical-psychiatric point of view must also take place in a prison. It is therefore also ordered by the prison doctor as a medical measure. The public prosecutor's office took place because of negligent homicide under particularly dangerous circumstances on investigators against suspected officials and doctors. The case was examined by the Judiciary of Austria. In the opinion of expert Dr. Wolfgang Denk, Specialist in Forensic Medicine, dated April 8, 2002, stated: \\"... Ernst K. died as a result of a mechanical intestinal obstruction in the area of pre-existing adhesions in the abdominal cavity due to cardiovascular failure of a natural death...seat belts..is not casually realated to the appearance of the intestinal paralysis.\\" The Krems an der Donau prosecution stopped on May 15, 2002, the previous surveys, because the fixation of the prisoner Ernst K. in the hospital bed offered from a medical point of view and the occurrence of death was due to a natural cause.

It was designed by Harry Seidler and built from 1953 to 1954. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 October 2016.  History  The site of 9 Stuart Crescent is part of (Portion 250 of the Parish of St George) granted to merchant and brewer John Terry Hughes, the nephew of wealthy emancipated convict merchant Samuel Terry, and his business partner John Hosking, who was also the second mayor of Sydney. They were granted the land on 26 August 1840. In April 1853 the president of the Bank of New South Wales, John Holden, conveyed the property to Benjamin Yabsley, who the following day conveyed it to Charles Mitchell. After Mitchell died the trustees of his estate sold the property to George Alfred Tucker, in March 1874. Three years later Tucker sold the land to Samuel William Gray, who made application to convert the property to Torrens Title in December 1881. Gray (1823–1889) was born in Armagh in Northern Ireland. He and his family arrived in NSW around 1835. His father purchased , known as \\"Omega Retreat\\", between Kiama and Gerringong and became a farmer and grazier. Gray was educated at the Normal Institution in Sydney, following which he went to sea in 1849 and then travelled to Bendigo during the gold rushes. He returned to Kiama and settled into life as a farmer and grazier at Bendella. Gray leased in the Camden District in 1860 and in the early 1860s took up land on the Tweed River. He later returned to family properties near Kiama. He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly in June 1859, initially representing Kiama and subsequently Illawarra and Richmond. Gray acquired business interests in Sydney and lived there until his death. After Gray died the land passed to his widow Mary, police magistrate Joshua Bray of Murwillumbah and Edmund Caswell Bowyer Smyth, engineer of Albury. It was bounded by a foreshore reservation, which, was subsequently granted to Mrs Gray, Bray and Edmund Caswell Bowyer- Smyth on 17 May 1894. The land was then assigned to Augustus Morris and Charles King in October 1894, who later that month transferred its title to the City Bank of Sydney. On 18 August 1911 the title to 3 roods 7 perches of the land was transferred to master plumber William Henry Watson of St Peters, who in turn transferred it to plumber Francis Watson of Blakehurst on 28 October 1919. Francis Watson sold the land to Percy Allan, licensee of the Pymble Hotel, during the first quarter of 1929. Allan subdivided it into three allotments and offered it for sale at the beginning of the 1940s. The first sale was to Marrickville bricklayer Thomas Tyson Dixon and his wife Ellen. Transfer of title took place on 26 May 1941. The Dixons sold the land to Ryde electrician John McBride in February 1944. McBride then sold it to master mariner William Obide Lewis Wilding and his wife Agnes, who lived in Hurstville, in July 1946. They, in turn, sold the land to master tanner James Thomas Dale of Maroubra in May 1949; he sold it to Bankstown company director Herbert George Palmer in July 1950. The following year Palmer sold the land to Mr and Mrs David Thurlow. The transfer of title took place on 17 September 1951, to Marjorie Olive Thurlow. Marjorie Thurlow, nee Latham, was born on 14 December 1919, the younger daughter of Mr and Mrs Bertrand Latham of Roseville. Her father was secretary to the Board of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, subsequently serving as secretary of the Note Issuing Department and its Chief Actuary. She had two brothers and one sister, and attended Abbotsleigh School in Wahroonga. Marjorie Latham graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts in English, European History and Psychology in 1940. Marjorie (also known as Dolly by family members) joined the RAAF in World War II and is thought to have served as an Assistant Section Officer in Signalling Corps. On 25 May 1946, Marjorie Latham married David Keith Thurlow at Roseville Methodist Church. David Thurlow was born on 25 November 1919, the son of Mr and Mrs W Thurlow of Pymble. He served articles under solicitors E Lewis and J Egan of Sydney and studied law at the University of Sydney during the first half of the 1940s. On 7 March 1947, he applied to be admitted as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of NSW and subsequently set up in practice. The firm that he founded continues today. The young couple initially lived at Punchbowl until moving to Blakehurst. They engaged the dynamic up-and-coming young architect Harry Seidler to design their new home there. Harry Seidler (1923–2006) was born in Vienna. He left there in 1938, moving to England to escape the Nazi occupation of Austria. He studied Building at the Cambridge Shire Technical School but was interned in 1940 and eventually shipped to Canada. In Canada, he was permitted to study architecture at the University of Manitoba. He graduated with first class honours in 1944 and the following year won a scholarship allowing him to attend the Harvard Graduate School of Design where he studied under architect Walter Gropius, formerly Director of the Bauhaus in Germany. Seidler then studied at the experimental and short-lived Black Mountain College summer school in 1946 under another former Bauhaus teacher, Josef Albers. Between September 1946 and March 1948 Seidler worked as architect Marcel Breuer's chief assistant. Breuer, who had been educated at the Bauhaus and then became master of its carpentry shop, had also been Gropius' professional partner during the 1930s. Seidler left America to travel to Australia, spending some time in Rio de Janeiro to work with the prominent architect Oscar Niemeyer. He finally arrived in Sydney during July 1948, having travelled all that distance at the instigation of his parents. They had migrated here from England in 1946 and had asked if he could design a house for them. The Rose Seidler House (named after his mother) was the very first that he built in Australia and was completed in 1950. It opened the door to numerous commissions for houses over the next five decades that were situated across metropolitan Sydney and its outskirts, in Canberra and as far away as Darwin. The house also won Seidler his first Sulman Medal. The firm of Harry Seidler & Associates was formed around 1954. Seidler approached Gerardus (Dick) Dusseldorp of the recently formed Lend Lease Corporation at the end of the 1950s with plans of what was to become the block of flats called Ithaca Gardens in Elizabeth Bay. The relationship between Harry Seidler & Associates and Lend Lease proved fruitful right up to the beginning of the 1990s. Over the years Seidler's office designed a wealth of different building types including individual houses, apartment blocks, office buildings, public buildings and industrial structures that remained true to Harry Seidler's deeply held Modernist convictions about what architecture should be. This rigorous and uncompromising approach, though not always understood or appreciated by the general public, resulted in an impressive record of masterful and often innovative works, the quality of which was frequently recognised by awards for excellence. Significant Sydney projects include Blues Point Tower (1961), Australia Square, which won both the Sulman Medal and the Institute of Architect's Civic Design Award for 1967, the MLC Centre (1978), which won the Sulman Medal for 1983 and Grosvenor Place (1988) which was awarded the Sulman Medal for 1991. Seidler's own complex of office and residential spaces at Milson's Point (built in several stages between 1973 and 1994) received the Sulman Medal for 1981 while the office extension and penthouse won the Institute's Interiors Award for 1991. Seidler's national and international contributions to architecture were reflected in the receipt of the Institute of Architects' Gold Medal in 1976 and then was recognised by it once more with a Special Jury Award for International Practice in 2000. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, while the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded him its highest honour, the Royal Gold Medal, in 1996. He was elected a member of the Academie D'Architecture de France in 1982, awarded the Gold Medal of the City of Vienna in 1989 and then Austria's highest honour, the Cross of Honour for Arts and Sciences First Class, in 1995. Design and documentation for the Thurlow's new house was well underway by September 1951. It was prepared by Frank D'Arcy and Don Gazzard. Structural engineer Peter Miller was also involved on the project. As with a number of early houses by Seidler, the Thurlow house was evidently built to a tight budget and the Thurlows organised construction of the house themselves. The concept behind the house was described on a sketch drawing describing the rear of the building. Issues of privacy were taken into account, as was the primacy of the view over the Georges River. The optimal location on the site, however, was only wide - \\"enough for living-dining + kitchen.\\" In this part of the site it was not considered desirable to expose rooms to the street or to the east and west because of privacy and \\"sunprotection\\" respectively. A two-storey house was considered both dull and wasteful \\"with 9'-0\\" minimum ceilings.\\" Instead, \\"Low level mezzanine solution gives all rooms a view and also produces a covered terrace as well as interesting flowing interior vertical space. Sun enters higher living space thru sunprotection [sic] louvres on North toward sun court.\\" Placing the carport on the northern side of the house was an \\"obvious location\\" for the structure. Marjorie and David Thurlow separated and were divorced in 1970. Marjorie remained living in the house until advancing age forced her into alternative accommodation. David Thurlow died on 8 February 2014. Marjorie Thurlow died on 14 December 2014.  Description  Thurlow House consists of a split level dwelling and a detached garage, which are linked by a short covered concrete bridge. The garage is to the north of the house facing Stuart Crescent, while the house is oriented towards a view overlooking the Cooks River to the south. Eastern and western sides of the house are blank, providing protection from the sun and privacy from adjoining properties. The house is entered at mid-level; its plan is more or less bisected by an open tread stair with tubular steel handrails, one flight leading down to living areas, the other leading up to sleeping accommodation. The lower level contains a living room with a robust stone fireplace. It is separated from the dining area by the fireplace, along with the stair and entry landing. Beyond the dining room is a narrow kitchen and laundry, which opens onto a drying court between the house and the garage. The living and dining areas access a wide deck overlooking the view; a lavatory, aligned with the stair, intrudes into the deck space. The sleeping level above contains two bedrooms, a study and bathroom. This level extends from the southern end of the lower level spaces and cantilevers over the deck. The internal spaces are unified by the raked ceiling that falls from the southern side of the bedrooms to the north side of living areas. Storage space is located to the north of the main bedroom. Thurlow House was described in Seidler's first promotional book, Houses, Interiors and Projects, which was published in 1954. It remains relevant because of the high level of integrity that the house has retained: The structure of the house consists of brick/stone cavity walls, steel columns and beams, timber-framed floors and roof. External walls are constructed out of randomly coursed sandstone and pale \\"Chromatex\\" bricks manufactured by Punchbowl Brick and Pipe Co. while internal walls are constructed out of timber stud framing. Floors are constructed with oregon joists fixed to lugs welded onto steel beams. Floors and internal walls are lined with tongue and groove tallow wood boards. The roof was originally lined with 4-ply asbestos felt (a commonly used building material at this time) with white marble chip protective finish, insulated with aluminium sarking and Insulwool batts and flashed with copper. It has since been replaced by metal decking. Windows are framed in steel. Internal lighting was quite advanced for the period and still remains in place – recessed ceiling mounted down lights and fluorescent tubes in the kitchen, above the east wall of the living room and dining rooms. Fluorescent tubes are also located in a recess behind the built-in cabinet mounted on the north wall of the living room. Supplementary wall mounted fixtures augment the main lighting. The kitchen was originally comprehensively detailed and equipped to a standard above most houses of the period. Much of this remains, such as an exhaust fan, cupboard and servery joinery and fitments. The kitchen is linked to the main bedroom by a dumb waiter. = Condition = , the house was in relatively good condition, although in need of some maintenance. The landscape setting is overgrown and weed-infested. The house has retained a high level of integrity and has retained a substantial amount of original building fabric, fitments and joinery items in living areas, bedrooms and kitchen/laundry = Modifications and dates = Modifications have been limited in extent. The original roofing has been replaced with metal decking, possibly as a result of the deterioration of the original roofing materials and possible water ingress. The openings to the carport have been enclosed to form a garage, chains to convey roof rainwater have been installed on the northern side of the house, new floor linings have been installed above original kitchen floor linings, some appliances have been removed or replaced in the kitchen and some bathroom fittings have been replaced.  Heritage listing  Thurlow House is of state heritage significance because it is a fine and rare example of an exceptionally intact early Modern Movement house, designed by influential and internationally significant architect Harry Seidler. It is representative of the early houses of Harry Seidler and demonstrates his design philosophy, methodology, exploitation of structure and use of building materials. The house is important in Seidler's body of work because of its inventive split level configuration and architectural form resulting from the constraints of the site and its view potential. The resulting house displays sophisticated spatial relationships and functional planning. Thurlow House incorporates progressive domestic construction and planning, demonstrated by the use of steel to cantilever sections of the building and the open planning that integrates living and bedroom areas. The house also provides evidence of advanced residential technology from the first half of the 1950s, demonstrated by elements such as indirect lighting using concealed fluorescent tubes and the integration of music equipment in built-in joinery in the living room. Its significance is enhanced by its high levels of physical integrity. The garden and grounds are an important component of the setting. They include remnant indigenous vegetation, which was intentionally retained during the construction of the house and which was rare for development in the early 1950s. The landscape setting, demonstrates Harry Seidler's philosophy that the settings for his houses be naturalistic. The retention of the single sculptural eucalypt in the front yard is characteristic of an aesthetic employed by Seidler and other Modern Movement architects. Views from the house over the treetops to the Georges River are significant as an essential element of the design of the house in its landscape setting. Thurlow House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Thurlow House is of state significance as an early house design by architect Harry Seidler, who produced an important body of work in NSW, other parts of Australia and internationally. Seidler's architecture is notable for its consistent and rigorous application of Modern Movement principles. Thurlow House reflects the impact of Seidler's seminal and early Rose Seidler House on sections of the wider community. Members of the professions amongst others were attracted to Seidler's work because of its design characteristics and because of publicity generated by the architect, in part because of his significant battles with local government over advanced architectural design and aesthetics. It is a remarkably intact house that has undergone little change since it was completed in 1954, and provides evidence of the dissemination of advanced Modern Movement architectural design in NSW after World War II. The garden and grounds of Thurlow House include remnant indigenous vegetation, which was intentionally retained during the construction of the house and demonstrates Seidler's preferred philosophy that the setting for his houses should be minimal in a horticultural sense. This was uncommon for development in the early 1950s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Thurlow House is of state significance for its association with internationally significant architect Harry Seidler and it is a fine example of Seidler's modernist design methodology. Seidler was the only architect working in NSW who had trained and worked under influential architects associated with the Bauhaus and brought a thorough understanding of European modernist methodology and aesthetics to NSW. The house is important in Seidler's body of work because of its particular split level configuration, whereby entry to the house is at mid- level and bedrooms are located on what equates to a mezzanine above living areas. The cantilevering of the bedrooms over the deck of the living areas is also a unique response to the constraints imposed by the site and its available views. Marjorie and David Thurlow, although not historically prominent, are representative of the young professional social class who commissioned Seidler, demonstrating awareness of, and positive response to, advanced architectural design within sections of the general community. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Thurlow House is of state significance as a finely designed and well-executed example of Modernist residential architecture. It is one of the finest and most intact houses that survives from the first half of the 1950s in NSW. The house demonstrates advanced planning and split level configuration, and demonstrates convincingly and well the characteristics of the Modern Movement residential architecture. The aesthetic value of the house is due in part to the exploitation of its structural system to provide dramatic spatial qualities and architectural form. It also provides evidence of advanced residential technology and amenity from this period, such as fluorescent and other lighting, kitchen design and surviving joinery, built in joinery items including the cabinet in the living room, which accommodated stereo equipment, and early passive sun control devices. The materials used in the house-stone, timber, brick, steel-framed windows-the built-in joinery and detailing are a consistent part of Seidler's architectural repertoire at this time and demonstrate his skill in exploiting their intrinsic textural qualities and colouring. The landscape setting, despite inadequate maintenance, demonstrates architect Harry Seidler's philosophy that the settings for his houses be naturalistic. Views from the house over the treetops to the Georges River are significant as an essential element of the design of the house in its landscape setting. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Thurlow House is of state significance as a rare example of a highly intact post-World War II Modern Movement house in NSW, which demonstrates advanced domestic construction and planning techniques. Although a relatively large number of Seidler's early houses have survived, many are known to have been subjected to alterations and additions which in some cases have obscured their early design and character. Thurlow House is rare at a state level as an intact example of the early architectural work of Harry Seidler. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Thurlow House is of state significance as a fine, representative example of post-World War II Modern Movement domestic architecture in NSW. The house is representative of the early domestic architecture of Harry Seidler. It demonstrates many of the characteristics of his residential design, including planning and organisation of spaces over several levels to exploit views and provide amenity for the occupants; built-in joinery units and general standard of detailing; and exploitation of structure to achieve open planning and spatial complexity. The representative qualities of the house are enhanced by its high levels of physical integrity. The landscape setting demonstrates Harry Seidler's philosophy that the settings for his houses be naturalistic. The single sculptural eucalypt in the front yard is representative of a landscaping aesthetic preferred by Seidler and other Modern Movement architects.

Double murder  On February 15, 1983, the bodies of 43-year-old Sieglinde Eckert and her eldest daughter, 18-year-old Ursula, were found in the Ungargasse 12 in Landstraße. A police doctor found that both women were killed with headshots from a rifle loaded with explosive bullets. The bodies of the dead were so disfigured that officials were initially unable to distinguish between mother and daughter, with only the younger daughters being able to identify the two. Despite questioning all the neighbours, nobody had seen an armed man or heard a shot. There were no signs of a break-in at the apartment door, which led investigators to believe that the victims might have known the offender and opened the door to him. The questioning of a friend of Ursula's brought the officials onto something. She said that she had talked to Ursula shortly before the murder, saying that she had recently been visited by her ex-boyfriend Paul and that he had a weapon with him. But because he was scary, she broke off contact with him. The police investigated Paul, who turned out to be Günter Lorenz. He was 18 years old, had just passed his exams with distinction and lived in a Vienna caretaker's apartment. In the first interrogations, he denied having anything to do with the murders until the investigators found personal belongings of the victims in his home. He then said that he had wanted to rob his ex-girlfriend, but did not dare to do it alone. That's why he asked his 16-year-old Peter Daubinger to accompany him. However, he had brought a weapon, shot the two women and had fled with the loot. Since Daubinger was untraceable, the police initiated a search for him and warned of his dangerousness. In the meantime, Daubinger was presented as the true culprit in the media.  Confessions and sentencing  Gewehr 98; Lorenz committed all three murders with a weapon of this type After two days of interminable interrogations, Lorenz began to contradict himself. It was then ascertained that Lorenz and Daubinger could never, as stated by Lorenz, have stolen 10,000, but a maximum of 2,000 shillings, and thus Daubinger could have stolen the 8,000 other shillings. Finally, Lorenz confessed to having shot the two women himself. He used a Gewehr 98 with explosive ammunition, normally used for big game hunting. He had bought the ammo in a Viennese gun shop. In order to be able to wear it concealed, he had sawn off the piston and used a piece of carpet as a silencer. After a few hours, he finally confessed to the murder of his cousin, whom was killed with three shots and then beheaded on February 9 in an abandoned construction site on the banks of the Danube near Reichsbrücke, in order to make it harder to identify. Lorenz then led the investigators to Daubinger's body, which he had buried under a snowdrift on Donauinsel. The extreme cold-blooded and unrepentant nature of the 18-year-old not only astonished the investigators, but later led to the imposition of the maximum penalty. Just before he wrote a confession, he asked with a smile if he could start studying and practising sport in jail, and learned about the choice of books in detention centers. He also gave no comprehensible motive to date and said only that he did not like the three victims and thought they conspired against him. At first he even tried to portray Daubinger's killing as self-defense. The police assume he murdered his victims out of pure lust for killing. Despite having a notable personality disorder and mental dysfunction to a great extent, he was declared sane. Docent Dr. Willibald Sluga from the Department of Psychiatry said that he did not know a single crime that was comparable to it and that it was committed by a mental patient. Prosecutor Ernst Kloyber \\"has not experienced such crimes in 15 years of work experience\\" and demanded the maximum penalty, while Lorenz's defender Gunther Gahleitner cited the accused's poor childhood and wanted for him not be condemned, but be sent to a mental institution. The last words of the defendant were: \\"My defender is psychotic.\\" Vienna's Mittersteig Prison; Here Lorenz served his 20-year prison sentence On March 14, 1984, Günter Lorenz was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by presiding Justice Paul Weiser and was sent to a mental institution. In 2004, his dismissal was prevented by a psychiatric report, whereupon he began rampaging in Mittersteig Prison, threatening a psychologist and smashing furniture. He was overwhelmed by seven officials and was later transferred to the Stein Prison.  Impact  The character murder of Daubinger triggered outrage. His picture was published in the newspapers and he was named a \\"murderer\\", \\"double murderer\\" and \\"killer\\", based solely on Lorenz's statements. His affiliation to the right-wing scene and his alleged obsession with weapons proved completely unfounded. Many newspapers then published a letter of apology in their daily editions, in which they accused themselves of the media's judicial murder. The book and film rights for Lorenz was secured by Stern magazine. The price guaranteed him the coverage of his lawyer's fees. The murders also triggered a political discussion about the weapons law. The two deputies to the National Council Robert Lichal and Harald Ofner called for a tightening of the weapons law, while Interior Minister Erwin Lanc and deputy Hans Hobl emphasized that laws alone cannot prevent such bloody acts. It was criticized that there are strict requirements for the acquisition of handguns, but extremely liberal for the acquisition of long guns such as pump action shotguns and carbines. However, with the introduction of a firearms license, more than 1.2 million gun owners would have to be prosecuted, and then an increase in the illegal arms trade was feared, so the laws remained untouched. The murder weapon, together with original newspaper reports, can be seen in the Vienna Crime Museum. In addition, the case of Günter Lorenz was examined in the book Traces of Evil.

It is a hand-drawn 2D animated update of the classic series by Eric Knight with CGI-animated vehicles in it. Characters =Main characters= * Lassie Protagonist and title character of the show, Lassie is a brown and white collie who lives in the Grand Mountain National Park with her owners, the Parker family. Fearless and brave, Lassie will never hesitate to put her life on the line for her family, friends and even random people she may or may not have met before. For the majority of Episode Durations, Lassie will only speak through her body language and barks, which are only translatable to those who know her well, except for when she is around her friends from the Red Barn such as Houdini the Hamster, Pica the Raven, Looper the Raccoon, or Biff the Pug (who has a crush on her), where she will speak perfect English like her animal and human friends or family can. * Zoe Parker Owner of Lassie and daughter of Sarah and Graham. Having inherited her parents' love of nature, Zoe cares a great deal about life in the Park and goes out of her way to protect it, sometimes without thinking and ultimately putting her life at risk. She is normally the one to call Lassie in the day old style, whether there is an emergency or not. * Chief Ranger Graham Parker Head of the Grand Mountain National park Ranger Department, Graham, like the rest of his family, is a passionate nature lover and will do anything in his power as Chief Ranger to prevent anyone from damaging the serenity of the Park. Like his wife, Park veterinarian Dr. Sarah Parker, Graham will often worry about the safety of his daughter Zoe before reassuring himself that Zoe is a smart kid who has forgotten more about exploring the beauty of the Park than any tourist has ever learned and as long as she has Lassie by her side, she can never come to any harm. He once owned a dog that was similar in breed and personality to Lassie, named Shadow, when he was a boy. Sadly, when Graham was eight years old, Shadow was bitten by a snake as he tried to save Graham. Graham, who didn't fully understand at the time, thought he was responsible for the death of his dog and ultimately, even the death of his grandfather, who got sick and died a short while after Shadow and thus, distanced himself from the cabin owned by his grandfather. He later discovered, thanks to Lassie, Zoe and Harvey, that this was not the case and that his grandfather's sickness and death was purely down to something else, more than likely old age. Graham reviled that, whilst he never actually visited the property since the Shadow incident up until the point that he returned to face his fears, he was still keeping up the mortgage on the property and land, meaning the Parker family still owned the property, which ultimately prevented Robert Humphrey from selling it to developers looking to build a leisure hotel. * Dr. Sarah Parker As the National Park's resident veterinarian, Sarah takes pride in her work, caring for any animal that may need her medical knowledge. Like her husband and daughter, Sarah is quick to express outrage whenever someone or something is threatening the tranquillity of the Park. * Harvey Smith Zoe's best friend. A skilled navigator, like his late father, Jason Smith, Harvey always has a route planned out. He will often follow Zoe and Lassie in their adventures, even if the situation may seem dangerous. * Mrs. Beth Smith Mother of Harvey Smith and supposedly a member of staff at the National Park's visitor centre. As Harvey is all she has to remember her Husband by, Beth is often concerned whenever Harvey could be in danger. Luckily, she knows that, wherever there's danger, Lassie won't be far. * Mrs. Ida Lee Proprietor of the National Park's general store, 'The Happy Camper', Mrs. Lee may look like any ordinary old lady, but she is far from it, as a couple of poachers learnt when she demonstrated her skills as a rodeo champion by hogtying them whilst they tried to capture a bear cub.

First crimes  Born illegitimately and raised in Salzburg, Kniesek began skipping school, stealing and running away from home as a youth. He had never met his father and his mother was overwhelmed with him, so she wanted him to find himself a house. When he learned this, Werner stabbed her with a knife, stole some money and fled to Germany, where the 16-year-old was arrested in Hamburg and extradited back to Austria. After two years of juvenile detention for attempted murder, Kniesek was released. After committing several burglaries, he shot a 73-year-old woman. In 1973, he pleaded insanity and was sentenced to only eight and a half years in prison, where he was dismissed in early January 1980 for good behaviour. A few weeks before his release, he was given a three-day prison leave from the Garsten Prison to seek work. He had been convicted seven times since the age of sixteen, had been in prison for fifteen years, and spent 13 months in a workhouse.  St. Pölten murders  With the money that Kniesek received in jail through making illegal liquor, he bought a gas pistol in Vienna and on January 16, 1980 went by train to St. Pölten, where he posed as a carpet representative, and took a taxi to the Am copper Brunnbergbrought settlement. Arbitrarily, he broke into the villa of the Altreiter family in the Fuchsenkellergasse, where 26-year-old wheelchair-bound Walter was living, whom Kniesek knew since he was three years old. He held Walter down, and when his 55-year-old mother Gertrude and 24-year-old sister Ingrid came home in the evening, they were overwhelmed and tied by Kniesek in the hallway. Since the mother believed this was a robbery, she presented the offender with a check for 20,000 shillings. Shortly thereafter, Kniesek tortured and strangled the son with his bare hands, dragging the body of the wheelchair to his mother, torturing her as well, and then strangling her three hours later with a noose. Ingrid was mistreated by Kniesek for seven to eleven hours and then strangled as well. Her body was covered with welts, hematomas, and dozens of burn marks. Before she died, she had responded to a call from her fiancé, saying that she was in a hurry, had no time, and had to cancel an upcoming meeting. Kniesek is said to have been in the vicinity. He also killed the family's cat, laid down and fell asleep next to his victims. A 21-year-old lodger survived because she had exchanged her day off with a colleague and therefore was not at home.Police: It's unbelievable what's going on in his brain  Capture and condemnation  The next morning Kniesek packed the three bodies in the trunk of the family's Mercedes-Benz and undertook a shopping spree with the redeemed check. In Karlstetten, Kniesek visited a restaurant and some people became suspicious when they noticed the large amounts of cash of the taciturn man, who also wore black gloves, which he did not take off for the whole meal. He also inquired about the next motorway ramp. An employee noted down the Mercedes' license plate and alerted the gendarmerie, who then drove to the Altreiters' estate and discovered a broken window. Since the three residents were also missing, a nationwide search for the car and the family was initiated. Shortly before midnight, a radio patrol car found the car at the Salzburg Südtiroler Platz and was able to arrest Kniesek and return him to the vehicle. While searching the vehicle, authorities discovered the three bodies in the car's trunk. After two days, Kniesek finally confessed to having murdered the Altreiter family out of sheer desire to kill. The murders served only his mental satisfaction and he could not point out any other murders. He even forced Gertrude Altreiter to take her heart medicine, so that she would not lose consciousness and experience the agony better. According to investigators, the Altreiter family happened to be among his victims, for Kniesek had planned to kill a builder's family and inquired about the address of a doctor who did not live there. The dog present is said to have deterred him, according to the St. Pölten police commander.An entire family eradicated: For the pleasure of killing In a cell of the Salzburg provincial court Kniesek tried to kill himself, but was prevented by court officials. On July 4, 1980, Werner Kniesek was sentenced by the St. Pölten district court to life imprisonment and admitted to an institution for the mentally unstable.It was a kind of compulsion In 1983, he made an escape attempt from the Stein Prison, but he failed.  Impact on the prison system  At a press conference, Minister of Justice Christian Broda commented on the case of Werner Kniesek, stressing the importance of scientific and medical advice in prison, and that if Kniesek had been convicted after January 1, 1975, this crime would not have happened. At that point in time, the concept of insanity had been extended so that perpetrators like Kniesek could be accommodated to mental hospitals, even beyond the expiration of their judiciously received punishment. Since there are no retroactive laws in Austria under the rule of law, dangerous prisoners such as Kniesek could not be included in the enforcement of measures retrospectively. Therefore, a nine-member working group was formed, which would capture prisoners who were sentenced under the existing penal code until 1975, the new penal code but could fall into the group of mentally abnormal lawbreakers and potential recidivists. Although these could not subsequently be transferred to the enforcement, they would serve their remainder in a special institution.Tragic case proves important to the new prison system  Film  The film Angst by Gerald Kargl is based on Werner Kniesek's crimes.

The preparatory process went on for a year and a half. Unlike the first film, events do not take place in the Moscow district of Chertanovo, but in the central part of Moscow, including the territory of Moscow State University and beyond. As in the first part, the shooting took part in modern equipment of the Russian Armed Forces, including the Aurus Senat car in the sedan version, which was created as part of the Cortege project. =Filming= Principal photography began on July 24, 2018, covered almost 10,000 kilometers and was held in the strictest confidence. 2 film crews were shot in Moscow, and were held in strict secrecy, Kaliningrad, Kamchatka Peninsula and Hungary. The whole district of Moscow was cordoned off at night to shoot a scene of a chase with eight cameras and a helicopter in Orlikov Lane and on the neighboring streets. Part of the chase was shot on an unfinished section of the fourth ring road in Moscow, which was specially filled with cars. Artists made a mini-expedition to Kaliningrad to shoot a Finnish episode of the beginning of the film, one of the first scenes of which was shot during a real storm. The film crew flew to Kamchatka, to Russian New Zealand, for 2 days for an astounding shooting of the final scene, shot in the Ksudach stratovolcano, the last eruption of which occurred 100 years It was in the legendary \\"Origo Studio\\" in Budapest that some scenes of complex floods were shot with almost 450 people participating in a gigantic mobile stage formed by a gigantic pool fueled by fire hydrants where you can load jewelry. Thus, the roof of a 9-story building was built there in full size and immersed under one of the scenes of the film. For filming underwater scenes, Irina Starshenbaum studied diving for two months before shooting. Her record is 15 hours of filming in the pool. Music The composer Igor Vdovin wrote the soundtrack for this film. It has been available since January 10, 2020, on Yandex Music,Igor Vdovin iTunes,Igor Vdovin BOOM.ruIgor Vdovin and VKontakteIgor Vdovin .

Another trailer contains a remix, also from Imagine Music, the famous tune of Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky. = Post-production = The team of the Russian special effects studio Main Road Post, responsible for the film’s graphics, recreated Moscow to the last detail using a computer to really create, among other things, a grandiose apocalyptic scene of large-scale immersion in water, “a real challenge,” says Arman Yakhin, director of the studio. Graphic designers are also very proud of the battle scene of Artyom against the Kamov Ka-52.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment for three murders, and his case had a significant impact on the treatment of dangerous sexual offenders and their legal provisions in Switzerland.  Murder of Pasquale Brumann  On the afternoon of October 30, 1993, after a one-day operation on the Zollikerberg near Zürich, the body of the missing 20-year-old boy scout leader Pasquale Brumann was found. She had been stabbed in the neck and buried naked in the forest.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, November 1, 1993, p. 22  The perpetrator  As early as November 1, 1993, Hauert, who was convicted of eleven rapes and two sexually-charged murders, was arrested and later confessed to the crime. DNA analysis also provided further evidence to this. The detainee at the Regensdorf Detention Center had committed the crime while out on parole.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, November 10, 1993, p. 53 Earlier, Hauert had raped and murdered a 26-year-old jogger in Thalwil near Lake Zürich in 1982, and a 72-year-old woman in Kaiseraugst a year later. After he was arrested in June 1983 after an attempted robbery, he was proven guilty, classified as \\"extremely dangerous\\" and sentenced to life imprisonment. In all the years he spent in prison Hauert's sentence had been loosened successively, as he behaved harmlessly and was given a few holiday leaves to no complaints. On October 29, 1993, the Zürich Department of Justice approved another short leave for Hauert, and just a day later, he killed Brumann.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, March 26, 1999, p. 45  Aftermath  = Trial = In September 1996, Hauert was again sentenced to life imprisonment and reprimanded of parole.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, September 20, 1996, p. 53 The mother of the murdered, Jeannette Brumann, filed a state liability suit against the canton, reaching up to the Federal Supreme Court. The canton denied any responsibility, but recognized in April 1997 the family's claims for \\"moral reasons\\". In 1998, it finally came to a comprehensive comparison. The canton of Zürich paid against the renunciation of the family to further civil claims about one million francs.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, March 20, 1998, p. 53 The trial against the four judicial staff involved in granting Hauert parole resulted in acquittals, and they received five digit process compensations.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, March 3, 1999, p. 46 = Impact on the prison system = After the murder, the leave and discharge guidelines were tightened and the custody increased massively, reducing the number of relapses.Neue Zürcher Zeitung, February 22, 2001, p. 45 = Legislation = In response to the Brumann murder and another sex offence committed by another repeat offender, a popular initiative \\"Lifelong custody for unreachable, extremely dangerous sexual and violent offenders\\" was launched. This was submitted on May 3, 2000 with 194 390 valid signatures. On February 8, 2004, the initiative had the popular majority of 56.2 percent and the cantons of 21.5 accepted Act 123a in the Swiss Federal Constitution.Wording of Article 123a Therefore, sex offenders and violent offenders classified as extremely dangerous and untreatable in the forensic reports prepared for trials must be jailed until the end of their lives and are excluded from parole and early release. New reports may only be prepared when new scientific evidence has proven that the custodian can be cured. All reports must be prepared by at least two independent and experienced professionals. If, on the basis of these new opinions, an offender is released from custody, the competent authority must take responsibility if the person dismissed relapses. = Criticism of the Judiciary = The judiciary as the director of the Zürich Conseil d'État at the time of cantonal corrections charge, later Swiss Federal Councilor, Moritz Leuenberger, was made politically responsible for the death of Pasquale Brumann. He had been repeatedly informed by the competent state's attorney Pius Schmid on Hauert's dangerousness, but did not take the appropriate measures. In the report on the question of granting parole for Erich Hauert he had been warned that Hauert suffered from \\"psychopathic disturbances of the character structure\\".WOZ- Online, January 8, 2014  Press articles  * Peter Holenstein: \\"One word could have been enough\\" (Weltwoche, January 14, 2004, Issue 3/04) – Interview with the mother of the victim * Alex Baur: The Brumann case - corpse in the cellar (Weltwoche, September 5, 2007, Issue 36/07) – Report on the details and consequences of the crime as well as failures of the Judicial Directorate  References  Category:Swiss serial killers Category:Swiss people convicted of murder Category:Murder in Switzerland Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Male serial killers Category:1982 murders in Europe Category:1983 murders in Europe Category:1993 murders in Europe Category:1996 murders in Europe Category:1982 crimes in Switzerland Category:1983 crimes in Switzerland Category:1993 crimes in Switzerland Category:1996 crimes in Switzerland Category:1980s murders in Switzerland Category:1990s murders in Switzerland Category:People convicted of rape ","title":"Erich Hauert"},{"id":"57994994","text":"The Appleyards' 1950, 1951 and 1952 Coupe des Alpes-winning Jaguar XK120, registration NUB 120, being demonstrated at Goodwood in 2008 Patricia C. Quinn (née Lyons; b. 23 April 1927), best known by her former married name Pat Appleyard, is a British former rally driver and co-driver. She is the daughter of Jaguar Cars founder Sir William Lyons. Co-driving with her then-husband, Ian Appleyard, she won the Alpine Rally's Coupe des Alpes each year from 1950 to 1953, in one of her father's company's Jaguar XK120 cars. On the third of these triumphs, in 1952, the Appleyards were the first crew ever to be awarded the event's Coupe d'Or (Gold Cup), for having won three consecutive Coupes des Alpes. During their competitive career the couple's major event victories also included the 1951 and 1953 RAC Rallies and the 1951 Tulip Rally, and they were runners-up in the 1953 European Rally Championship. Her own driving career was less successful than her husband's, a fact that she herself partly put down to being unable to find suitably qualified female co-drivers, but nevertheless she won a number of ladies' trophies in British events.

Referring to his 2001 comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Smith has described the film as \\"literally the same fuсking movie all over again\\". It is the eighth film in the View Askewniverse. The film also stars Jason Mewes, and features cameos from Brian O'Halloran, Jason Lee, Justin Long, Shannon Elizabeth, Rosario Dawson, Val Kilmer, Melissa Benoist, Craig Robinson, Tommy Chong, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck. It was theatrically released with sessions around North America on October 15 and 17, 2019, and had the second highest per-screen average of 2019 (behind Parasite), thanks to its ongoing travelling roadshow. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot is the first movie to have per-screen averages over $60,000 four different times in its domestic run. Plot Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) lose a court case to Saban Films, who are making a new Bluntman and Chronic film, Bluntman V Chronic. The two also learn they have lost their naming rights, and can no longer self-identify as \\"Jay and Silent Bob\\". Jay and Bob visit Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee), who tells them about the Bluntman and Chronic reboot, which is being directed by Kevin Smith. The film is largely completed, but a major scene is to be shot at the annual fan convention \\"Chronic-Con\\" in Hollywood. Jay and Bob have three days to get to Los Angeles to stop the film from being completed and win back their identities. The two depart for California. They arrive in Chicago, where Jay learns his former girlfriend Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) works as a local weatherperson. Jay and Bob visit Justice, who tells Jay he left her heartbroken by never visiting her in jail. She has since married Reggie (Rosario Dawson) and given birth to their love child, Millennium \\"Milly\\" Faulken (Harley Quinn Smith). She introduces Jay to their daughter and her best friend Sopapilla (Treshelle Edmond), but urges him to never reveal his identity to her. Justice leaves for vacation, and Milly forces Jay to take her and Sopapilla to Hollywood with him and Bob. Milly drugs Jay and Bob with a strong edible, and they wake up on a highway in New Orleans, where they meet Milly's two other friends, Jihad (Aparna Brielle) and Shan Yu (Alice Wen). They tell Jay that they want to visit Chronic-Con because Shan Yu is a huge fan of the first Bluntman and Chronic film and it is her dream to attend Chronic-Con. They steal a van and drive to California. Milly admits to Jay that her bad behavior is attributed to her never knowing her father. Jay and Bob are abandoned by the group, and set off in search of the van. They find it in a vacant area, where the Ku Klux Klan have kidnapped the girls and are having a rally. Bob steals a klan hood and passes himself off as the new Grand Dragon to distract them while Jay rescues the girls. They throw a portable toilet at the Klansmen and flee. The group makes it to Chronic-Con and sneak in. Jay and Bob plan to ruin the shoot, while the girls want to be extras in the film to fulfill Shan Yu's dream. They agree to part ways, with Jay hugging Milly and letting her know he is proud of her. After attempting to sneak past a familiar security guard (Diedrich Bader), Jay and Bob are pursued throughout the con. They hide in an empty panel room where they are met by Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck), who has just finished recording a podcast with Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams). Holden has donated his sperm to Alyssa and her wife (Virginia Smith) so they may have a child, whom he helps co-parent. Holden tells Jay that fatherhood gave him a new purpose. This inspires Jay to abort their mission and be a father to Milly. Holden gives them VIP badges, which grants him and the girls access to the panel with Kevin Smith. Noticing that Bob bears a resemblance to Smith, Milly sneaks backstage and knocks out Smith, giving Smith's clothes to Bob as a disguise. They bring Milly and Shan Yu on stage to film the scene, but Shan Yu sees through their ruse and knocks Bob unconscious, bringing out the real Kevin Smith. Bob is thrown out of the hall and Shan Yu reveals herself to be a Russian spy, bent on destroying American pop culture conventions. Jay reveals to Milly that he is her father. Bob regains consciousness outside and steals a large metal \\"Iron Bob\\" suit that was to be used in the filming of the scene. Controlling the suit, Bob incites a riot at the panel and disarms Shan Yu and her henchmen. After making their way back home, Jay shows Milly the Quick Stop and tells her the stories of his and Bob's adventures, including meeting Justice. Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) arrives to open Quick Stop and bemoans the fact that the steel shutters are once again jammed closed. In a post-credits scene, Jay tells Milly that for the past twenty-five years, he and Bob have been pranking Dante by jamming gum in the locks.

Production Following Clerks II, news has appeared often of other titles to be released in the View Askewniverse; these would include Clerks III and Mallrats 2. In 2017, Kevin Smith had confirmed that those projects were cancelled for several reasons, but revealed he had written a new film starring Jay and Silent Bob titled Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. The script was already finished when it was announced and it was said that Miramax would produce it. It was announced on January 25, 2019, that Saban Films had acquired distribution rights to the film in association with Universal Pictures. It is the first film in the View Askewniverse not to be produced by Scott Mosier, and the first film in the View Askewniverse since Mallrats not to be produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein. =Filming= Filming was initially set to begin mid-2017, then moved to August 2018, then to November of that same year. After the various delays, filming finally began on February 25, 2019, in New Orleans exactly one year after Smith suffered a massive and near-fatal heart attack. During the filming of the movie, Smith released a weekly documentary called Road to Reboot, showing what is being filmed that week. Production wrapped on March 27, 2019, after 21 days of shooting, which was the same number of days it took Smith to film his first movie, Clerks, 26 years earlier. =Casting= Mewes and Smith were attached to star as early as the film's announcement. Comic book writer Stan Lee was initially cast as himself in the film in July 2017,WATCH STAN LEE PERFORM A SCENE FROM JAY & SILENT BOB SEQUEL WITH KEVIN SMITH but due to his death on November 12, 2018, was instead given a tribute within the film at Brodie Bruce's comics shop while additionally appearing in the mid-credits through archival footage. The film was also dedicated to his memory. The film's original third act was to revolve around Lee, with an extended performance from him as a main character; however, given principal photography on the film did not commence until three months after Lee's death, the entire third act of the script was rewritten and was based on an unused draft from Mallrats 2. Ben Affleck was initially not involved in the film. When Affleck was asked in an interview if he got the call for Reboot, he said that \\"Your guess is as good as mine.\\" After hearing about that interview, Smith reached out to Affleck and wrote in a scene for Affleck's character Holden McNeil from his 1997 film Chasing Amy. Smith became excited that not only did he get Affleck in the film, but that he also got his \\"... BOYFRIEND BACK!\\" Release =Theatrical= The film was released on October 15, 2019, as part of two night Fathom Events showings. The first showing on October 15 gave away a limited edition poster of the film, and the second on October 17 was a double feature with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. =Roadshow= Following the Fathom showings, Smith embarked on a North American roadshow tour with a presentation of the film, followed by a Q&A; session. The roadshow began on October 19 in Asbury Park, New Jersey and continued until February 26, 2020, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The tour expanded internationally near the beginning of 2020. =Home media= The film became available on Blu-ray, DVD, and streaming on January 21, 2020. The United States home media releases were distributed by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 66% based on 38 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.39/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Fan-focused to a fault, Jay & Silent Bob Reboot tries to mock the same audience nostalgia it's mining -- and pulls it off often enough to satisfy the faithful.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". JoBlo.com's Paul Shirey gave the film an 8/10 and stated, \\"As comedy is so exceptionally subjective and this film so clearly tied to a somewhat niche appeal, I can only grade it as a fully biased fan of Smith, even if some of his flicks never worked for me, while others touched my cinematic nerve.

She was the first woman to serve on the Board of Governors of the American Board of Internal Medicine.  Early life and education  Dustan was born in 1920 in Craftsbury Common, Vermont to Helen Paterson and William Lyon Dustan. She attended Craftsbury Academy for her primary and secondary education before receiving her Bachelors of Science (cum laude) and medical degrees from the University of Vermont. Following graduation, she received her training in internal medicine at Mary Fletcher Hospital, which is now the Medical Center Campus at Fletcher Allen Health Care, in Burlington Vermont. She then moved to Montreal to do her residency in internal medicine at Royal Victoria Hospital.  Medical career  Following her residency, Dustan returned to Burlington in 1946 to help establish the medical student teaching program at Bishop DeGosbriand Hospital. In 1948, she moved to the Cleveland Clinic to work as a research fellow and in 1951 joined the staff of the Clinic's Research Division. She later became the Division's vice chairman from 1971 to 1977. Following her tenure as vice chairman, she moved to Alabama to join the faculty at University of Alabama at Birmingham as director of the Cardiovascular Research and Training Center and professor of medicine. Her contributions and leadership earned her the distinction of being named distinguished professor of the university in 1985. In 1987, she became 1 of 12 Distinguished Physicians (DP) of the United States Veterans Administration in their Department of Medicine and Surgery. The DP program was established in 1968 to attract doctors who had made significant contributions to medical science and have enjoyed long and distinguished careers. She retired from her position in 1990 and returned to Vermont, where she became a visiting professor of Pharmacology and Medicine at the University of Vermont College of Medicine. Throughout her career, Dustan held a number of leadership and advisory positions, leaving a lasting footprint on the medical community. In 1973, she became the first woman on the Board of Governors of the American Board of Internal Medicine. She was also an active member of the American Heart Association from 1973 to 1979, serving as its second woman president (1977–1978), chairing its Ethics and Research Committees, and acting as the first editor-in-chief of its journal, Hypertension. She also served as a member of the Board of Regents of the American College of Physicians from 1979 to 1984 and on the Advisory Board of the NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, establishing national clinical practice guidelines.  Research contributions  During her medical career, Dustan was involved in a series of innovations that have advanced the detection and treatment of hypertension. At the Cleveland Clinic, she worked in the Research Division with Drs. Irvine Page and Arthur C. Corcoran where she became a leading force in the field of hypertension. There, she was among the first to suggest that reducing dietary sodium could lower hypertension and risk for other cardiac disorders. In addition to recommendations for hypertension prevention, she advanced the medical field's understanding of the mechanisms underlying hypertension and helped develop early anti-hypertensive treatments. For instance, she studied the effects of serotonin in constricting blood vessels, which is now a treatment used in antidepressants. She also worked to characterize the role of the blood enzyme renin in hypertension—which is an often underdiagnosed cause of hypertension—and studied the effects of discontinuing anti-hypertensive medications in patients with hypertension. She was also a member of the team that established selective renal arteriography to track circulation in the kidneys and develop a reference standard by which to guide treatment and interventions. In so doing, her work transformed hypertension from a death sentence to a treatable disease.  Legacy  Following her death on June 27, 1999, Dr. Edward D. Frohlich, a colleague and scientist at the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, noted Dr. Dustan's keen intellect, delightful sense of humor, and service to humanity. In 2008, the American Heart Association established the Harriet Dustan Award in her honor, which is presented to female investigators who have made outstanding contributions in the field of hypertension.

A popular saying in imperial China was \\"If a household has a Zhengde coin, there will be material wealth and honour for ten thousand years\\" (家有正德錢富貴萬萬年, jiā yǒu zhèng dé qián fù guì wàn wàn nián).  Overview  It is generally believed that there were no cash coins minted by the government of the Ming dynasty under the reign of the Zhengde Emperor, however it has been claimed that a small number of cash coins were cast there doesn't seem to be any evidence supporting this claim. A common belief was that there were two and a half genuine cash coins in China which is what made these amulets lucky objects.Hartill, David (September 22, 2005). Cast Chinese Coins. Trafford, United Kingdom: Trafford Publishing. . Despite the fact that no Zhengde Tongbao were ever officially cast by the Ming dynasty a very large amount of them do exist today in the form of Chinese numismatic charms and amulets which is likely due to the fact that the inscription Zhengde Tongbao (正德通寶) could be translated as \\"currency of correct virtue\\" or \\"Coinage of True Virtue\\". Another possible reason why such a large number of Chinese numismatic charms with the inscription \\"Zhengde Tongbao\\" were cast is because it was believed m by many people during the Ming dynasty that the Zhengde Emperor was the reincarnation of a \\"swimming\\" dragon which gave the rise to the belief that carrying a Zhengde Tongbao amulet will protect its wearer from big waves while crossing a body of water such as the sea or a river. Other superstitions surrounding Zhengde Tongbao coins included that they protected pregnant women and their unborn offspring and that these coins would also help its carriers win gambling games. During Chinese new year Zhengde Tongbao cash coins were also given as \\"new year's lucky money\\" (壓歲錢, yā suì qián). Zhengde Tongbao charms commonly feature the image of a dragon and a fenghuang on their reverses, when a Chinese dragon and fenghuang are shown together they often symbolise the union of a man and a woman meaning that these Zhengde Tongbao charms were used as Chinese marriage charms. Although Gary Ashkenazy claims that the dragon and fenghuang symbolises matrimony, it is argued by Edgar J. Mandel in his book Metal Charms and Amulets of China that the dragon and fenghuang actually represent the power of the imperial Chinese government where the dragon represents the Emperor and the fenghuang the Empress. Another variant of the Zhengde Tongbao has two dragons on its reverse chasing after the wish-granting pearl. Another variant of the Zhengde Tongbao charm only contains the Hanzi character wén (文) on its reverse which is usually used as a measure word for counting cash coins but could also mean \\"obverse\\". These coins were also exclusively used as charms and amulets and were not meant for circulation. Edgar J.Mandel's book Metal Charms and Amulets of China lists 41 variants of the Zhengde Tongbao charm.  See also  * Ming dynasty coinage  References   Sources  * Edgar J.Mandel.

Life Lucy Anne FitzGerald was born on 5 February 1771, most likely in Leinster House, Dublin. She was the 17th of the 19 children of James FitzGerald, 1st Duke of Leinster and Lady Emily Fitzgerald (née Lennox). After her father's death in 1774, her mother moved to France with Lucy and the younger children, where she married the children's tutor, William Ogilvie. In 1781, the family returned to Ireland, and later moved in London. Both FitzGerald and her mother were supporters of her cousin, Charles James Fox, a radical Whig politician. She was also influenced by her brother, Lord Edward FitzGerald's political leanings which were both republican and pro-Catholic. During the period she spent in Ireland from October 1796 to May 1797, she met many of Edward's republican friends, including Arthur O'Connor. Until Edward's death in 1798, she kept a diary detailing her engagements and opinions on the Irish political upheaval of the time. Her diaries also provide an important factual account of Edward's movements, as she spent a great deal of time with his wife Pamela. Both of the women enjoyed French revolutionary songs and Irish jigs, and shared in their support for the Society of United Irishmen. These views appear to have put off many potential suitors, a fact she seems to have revelled in. Her friends interpreted her reaction of FitzGerald to the arrest of Arthur O'Connor as a sign she was in love with him, and his imprisonment in Kilmainham Gaol resulted in the hardening of her radical republican beliefs. Letters from O'Connor to FitzGerald were smuggled out of the Gaol on the fly-leaf of a book. She campaigned in London for his release, and the pair met again before his arrest in March 1798 in Margate. After her brother Edward's death on 4 June 1798, she wrote an open letter, To the Irish nation, in the hope of cementing his legacy and to further the Irish republican cause. Her step-father, Ogilvie, blocked its publication due to its incendiary contents. She also wrote to Thomas Paine. She continued to correspond with O'Connor while he was held in Fort George in Scotland in March 1799. Once again the letters are a record of his thoughts at the time, and the tensions within the United Irishmen movement. FitzGerald married Captain Thomas Foley RN on 31 July 1802. The couple lived at his Carmarthenshire estate, and had no children. Following his death in 1833, she lived in Arundel. She cherished the memory of her brother Edward, and criticised the 1831 biography of Edward by Thomas Moore as an inaccurate portrayal of him. FitzGerald returned to Marseille, where she had lived as a child, in 1841. She died there on 20 January 1851.

It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea and was first described by the Irish naturalist George Allman in 1846. Description The column of this species is smooth and roughly cylindrical, being slightly wider at the base and oral disc than in the centre. The base can grow to a diameter of about and is often ragged in outline; this is because the animal divides by longitudinal fission, and sometimes the two new individuals remain partially united. The individuals are usually found in dense aggregations, but each animal is only lightly attached to the substrate and can drift away. The tentacles are short to medium length, with tapering shafts and knobbed tips, and are in two whorls; the outer tentacles are the longer and the inner ones more numerous. The colour of this anemone is very variable; the column, tentacles and knobbed tips may be contrasting hues of white, pink, orange, red and green, while the oral disc is usually translucent, either plain or splashed with white. One common form is emerald green with brown tentacles with crimson tips, often with the oral disc having a crimson marginal ring. Distribution and habitat Corynactis viridis occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range includes Scotland, Ireland, the western and southern coasts of England and Wales, southwestern continental Europe and countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range extends from the lower shore to the sublittoral zone, to depths of about . It is found in dimly lit locations on rock, particularly vertical rock faces, overhangs and caves, and often forms dense patches. Ecology In addition to ordinary sexual reproduction, Corynactis viridis reproduces by means of longitudinal fission; in this process two sides of the anemone draw apart from each other, tearing the animal in half, after which both of the fragments heal and become new individuals.

Her grandfather, William Brockbank, was a wealthy Manchester businessman, a patron of the arts and an accomplished amateur naturalist. Family interests in the arts and sciences influenced both Chrystabel and her younger sister, Joan Beauchamp Procter (b. 1897). The family homes had large gardens, which facilitated the sisters’ childhood pursuits in natural history, and they were nicknamed \\"Flora\\" (Chrystabel) and \\"Fauna\\" (Joan). She was educated at St Paul's Girls' School, London, where she studied chemistry and botany, and then at Glynde College for Lady Gardeners, Sussex. Deaf from her mid-teens as a result of an hereditary condition on her mother's side of the family, she had been steered towards a career as a horticulturalist rather than continuing formal studies as an academic botanist. Career Chrystabel Procter was Gardener at St Paul's Girls' School from 1916-25, and was also Gardening Mistress for much of that period. She went on to become Head Gardener of Bingley Teacher Training College in Yorkshire before taking up her best-known role as Garden Steward at Girton College, Cambridge (as well as being an Examiner in Gardening at Homerton College) in 1933. At Girton she was responsible for the management of the college gardens, grounds, and grounds staff. This remit included the supply of fruit and vegetables to the kitchens throughout the rationing period of the Second World War. From the end of the war until her retirement in 1950 Chrystabel Procter became Estate Steward to Bryanston School in Blandford, Dorset. In retirement she travelled to East Africa and lived for several years at the Teachers’ Training College in Kaimosi, Kenya, where her friend Helen Neatby had been appointed Head. In the early 1960s ill health forced Chrystabel and Helen to return to England, where they settled in Somerset.

As she immersed herself in the Catalan flamenco scene, Rosalía met local fixture José Miguel Vizcaya \\"El Chiqui de la Línea\\", who suggested she started a degree in music. \\"El Chiqui\\" became Rosalía's teacher for the following eight years, as she studied Interpretation of Flamenco Singing at the Catalonia College of Music (Catalan: Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya, ESMUC). The ESMUC only accepts one student of this discipline per year and Rosalía was selected in 2014. The singer has described \\"El Chiqui\\" as a fundamental figure in her career, who encouraged her to investigate the genre even further back in time. Speaking with ABC, she stated: \\"To me, flamenco was Camarón, something of gypsy aesthetics, and when going back I found many other things that I loved. [...] When I discovered cantaores like Niño de la Huerta or \\"El Gloria\\", \\"El Chiqui\\" taught me to listen and appreciate their singing, because their recordings sound very bad! To people of our age that sound seems terrible to us.\\" Composition Los ángeles is a concept album that collects a series of cantes which have death as its central theme. It is a presentation of Rosalía as a soloist cantaora and as such its structure is similar to that of the debut of any orthodox flamenco singer: \\"a selection of varied palos, often with traditional or popular lyrics, in which the artist shows his or her aptitude and background.\\" In this manner, the singer encompasses several forms of the genre, including alegrías, tangos, fandangos, fandanguillos, seguidillas, tarantas, malagueñas and \\"more specific\\" styles like guajira, saeta and milonga. Rosalía felt that in the album \\"the cantes become songs\\", and as such did not list the palos titles in the track listing, explaining that: \\"It's a way of saying that I am based on melodies and lyrics from cantes, but we turn it into something else. Those who know something about flamenco will be able to identify them, because we are influenced by that, but we do our own thing.\\" It includes the cover of Enrique Morente's Aunque era de noche on Saint John of the Cross XVI century poem. Also it features the cover of La Hija de Juan Simón(1934). Rosalía told Ecleen Luzmila Caraballo of Jezebel in 2018: \\"I feel like with Los ángeles, I wanted to establish my musical legacy... and honor the classic sound of flamenco in the most traditional sense, respecting them to the maximum, with a pop and experimental structure, but with very basic instrumentation and a minimalist sound—just guitar and voice.\\" Release and promotion Rosalía and Raül Refree performing in Madrid, July 24, 2017. Los ángeles was released on 20 February 2017 on Universal Music Spain. It was released at digital audio stores and streaming platforms, as well as a CD and double LP record. \\"Catalina\\" was released as the album's lead single on 17 October 2016 and presented by Rosalía in Radio 3, after having shared its B side \\"Que se muere, que se muere\\" online a few weeks before. Its music video was directed by Txema Yeste and has been described as \\"a visual translation of the power of this song\\". An electronic press kit (EPK) featuring English subtitles was published in Rosalía's YouTube channel on 21 April 2017. The video was produced by Yverz and directed by Bàrbara Farré, with photography by Lucas Casanovas and animation by Pepe Gay. Spanish filmmaking collective Manson directed the music video for the second single \\"De plata\\", which features the singer performing the track as she walks and dances in the streets of Los Angeles, California. It was published in Rosalía's YouTube channel on 26 May 2017. Luis Troquel of Rockdelux felt that the clip showed a \\"facet of Rosalía that was unknown to many\\", as she dances \\"with a glowing enchantment and exuberant style.\\" Manson shot the clip in 16 mm film, as they \\"wanted to portray Rosalía as a classic Hollywood star, but with a contemporary sensibility.\\" The collective told Nowness that they chose the song because it had a \\"Tarantino-esque vibe\\" that they thought matched Los Angeles. They further explained: \\"Her art is very pure and wild and we wanted a video to match—no camera tricks, no VFX, no ornaments, no Tumblr aesthetics, just the pure and raw performance of a new- born classic star.\\" A cover version of Enrique Morente's \\"Aunque es de noche\\", which was not included in the album and had only been performed live, was released as a single on 2 November 2017 on streaming platforms. Its music video was directed by Ignasi Monreal and produced by CANADA in collaboration with Pink Salt and Collateral Films, with animation by Iria López, Dani Negrín and Bjørn-Erik Aschim from the London animation studio The Line. Filmed as a long take, the video's first two minutes show the inside of a car filled with elements of Christian symbolism, leading the viewer to Rosalía sitting on a chair. The singer then stands up and shows that she is inside a cemetery and in the last minutes, animation appears around and on her. According to Rosalía, the music video \\"intends to be a celebration of death as part of life\\", and as such has been linked to the concept of Los ángeles. In between recording for the video, Monreal also filmed Rosalía performing an a capella rendition of the track, which was released via Nowness on 14 December 2017. Critical reception Los ángeles received several positive reviews from music critics. Spanish magazine Rockdelux called it \\"one of the most intense and sweeping debuts of recent times\\", with critic Juan Monge complimenting its mix of tradition and avant-garde. AllMusic's Mariano Prunes highly commended Rosalía's vocals, writing that \\"her instrument is a tornado capable of sweeping away any cultural or language barriers\\", while noting that \\"she does not accomplish this with sheer volume or vocal histrionics, but by reaching almost unbearable levels of intensity and expression.\\" He concluded that Los ángeles \\"signals the appearance of a major talent in both the flamenco and the world music scene.\\" Writing for MondoSonoro, Yeray S. Iborra felt that with Los ángeles, Rosalía \\"is posited as the contemporary cantaora who has better understood the current times\\", noting the difference between the album and her \\"more American\\" collaboration with C. Tangana. =Flamenco specialists= In an El Confidencial article, musician and investigator Pedro Lópeh criticized the album, particularly Refree's arrangements, deeming them \\"artificial\\" and \\"wearisome\\". His views coincided with those of Silvia Cruz, another flamenco specialist. She explained: \\"I also insist on talking about Refree because the inks are always loaded against her and little or nothing against him, who is the producer and first author of this album. I do not think Los ángeles does any harm to flamenco, but it is a decontextualized product. Apart from the lyrics, I do not hear anything in it that appeals to the history of flamenco, its roots or its referents. For that reason, it does not seem to me a groundbreaking or revolutionary work and if it has come to save something, it is the music industry, not flamenco.\\" ABCs Alberto García Reyes told eldiario.es that while he does not consider Los ángeles to be \\"an aberration\\", he feels Rosalía is not suited for the genre. He said: \\"Rosalía does not sing badly, but in flamenco she does not fit much. She is a very respectful girl, who has not come to invent a revolution for her face. She does not hurt anyone or has proclaimed herself master of anything.\\" He was also critical of the album's promotional campaign, arguing that it installed the unworthy image of Rosalía as \\"the great revolution of flamenco\\". Accolades Los ángeles ranked highly in the year-end lists of the Spanish specialized press. It was listed as the best Spanish album of 2017 by newspaper ABC and magazine Rockdelux. Readers of the Barcelonian edition of Time Out selected Los ángeles as the best album of 2017, with the publication describing Rosalía as \\"the musical revelation of 2017\\". The album also appeared at number 6 in the year- end list of Spanish online magazine Jenesaispop.com, which described it as \\"an unbeatable presentation, up to the expectations, which are even higher in the face of a bright future.\\" CrazyMusic ranked the album at number 8 in its list of the best Spanish albums of 2017. Music critics of El País listed Los ángeles as the 10th best album of the year. Efe Eme selected the album as the 13th best Spanish record of 2017. It also appeared in Hipersónica's and Muzikalia's lists of the best Spanish albums of the year, at number 17 and 18 respectively. In late 2017, Rosalía received the Premio Ojo Crítico in the category of Modern Music, awarded by RNE. The jury highlighted the singer's \\"artistic projection, her interpretative capacity and versatility, her charisma, capable of transferring flamenco to young audiences.\\" Rosalía was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 2017 Latin Grammy Awards, losing to Vicente García. On 17 January 2018, Los ángeles was awarded the Premio Ruido, given to the best national album of the year by the Spanish music press. The album also received a Premio Glamour to \\"the arts\\", awarded by the Spanish edition of Glamour magazine in celebration of its 15th anniversary. Commercial performance Los ángeles debuted at number 42 on the Spanish Albums Chart on 19 February 2017. A month later, Sebas E. Alonso of Jenesaispop.com noted that the album had remained charting since its release, ascending to number twenty-eight in its third week and maintaining that position the following week. Feeling that it was in its way to becoming the Spanish \\"sleeper hit of the year\\", Alonso described Los ángeless chart run as \\"totally exceptional\\", taking into account that most albums \\"after the hype of the fans during the first week, [fall] slightly on the list until they settle depending on the duration of the promotion of the album or directly collapse.\\" Likewise, Jordi Bardají wrote on 1 November 2018 that the record was \\"one of the greatest 'sleepers' that Spanish sales lists have known in recent times.\\" Los ángeles reached its peak position of number nine on 11 November 2018 and remained in the albums chart until 9 February 2020, accumulating a total of 116 weeks.

The company was founded in 2008, and has a United States office in Oakland, California.  History  99designs was founded by Matt Mickiewicz and Mark Harbottle as a spin-off of Sitepoint, a website started in 1998 as a forum for web developers and designers. Designers on its forums began organizing contests based on fictional client briefs. The founders decided to test charging a fee to post briefs for real projects, eventually creating 99designs as a separate company for the contests. In 2008, the company opened a San Francisco office, because the majority of the platform's initial clients and designers were in the United States. It later moved its U.S. headquarters to Oakland, California. By 2012, the site had 175,000 designers in 192 countries. By 2016, it had about one million registered designers. The platform was later redesigned to allow customers to directly search for and hire designers, outside of design competitions. In 2012, the company acquired a European competitor called 12designer, based in Germany. Its office became the European headquarters of 99designs. In 2013, the company acquired LogoChef, a Brazilian competitor. In 2017, the company relocated back to Melbourne. In 2013, 99designs launched Swiftly, a website for small and quick design fixes, with services including altering logos, editing business cards or retouching photos. The company was acquired in October 2020 by netherlands Cimpress. Financials In 2011, the company received US$35 million in financing from Accel Partners and other investors.

She develops new refrigerants to be used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems, in Europe, North America, Australia and other countries. As of 2018, 50% of all new vehicles produced by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are believed to use her refrigerant, HFO-1234yf, an important contribution to countering global warming. Minor was one of five women to be named a Dupont Fellow in 2014, the first year that the company named women to its highest technical level. She was awarded the Perkin Medal in 2018. Life Minor graduated from Bucknell University in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering. Career Minor worked at DuPont from 1981 to 2015, when she moved to the spinoff company Chemours in Wilmington, Delaware. Minor develops new refrigerants for air conditioning and refrigeration systems. Her work supports the phasing out of ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and of hydrofluorocarbons that contribute to global warming. Minor was the technical leader for the research group at DuPont that developed HFO-1234yf, a hydrofluoroolefin that can reduce emissions from automotive air conditioning by more than 99%. HFO-1234yf has a much lower global warming potential (GWP) than the previously-used R-134a: its 100-year GWP was originally calculated as 4, and later recalculated as <1, compared to 1430 for R-134a. HFO-1234yf also has a lower atmospheric lifetime (11 days compared to 14 years), and higher energy efficiency under many conditions. The Dupont team worked jointly with researchers at Honeywell. As a replacement for R-134a, HFO-1234yf is marketed as Opteon yf by Dupont (later Chemours), and as Solstice yf by Honeywell. As of 2018, 50% of new vehicles produced by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are believed to use HFO-1234yf for air conditioning. Minor helped to develop both the XP (2014) and XL (2016) lines of refrigerant for Dupont and Chemours. In addition to alternative refrigerants for use in automobiles, more ecologically-friendly refrigerants have been developed for supermarket refrigeration systems (XP40) commercial freezers (XL20), reach-in coolers and freezers (R450A), beverage coolers (HFO-1234yf), large building chillers (XP30), transport units with self- contained refrigeration (XP44) direct expansion air conditioning, chilled water air conditioning and heat pumps (XL41, XL55). Minor is also a co- inventor of Dupont's ISCEON MO99 (R438A), a possible replacement for R22, and Suva 95 (R508B), a possible replacement for R13 and R503. A number of these refrigerants involve HFO/HFC blends. Minor holds more than 160 patents in the United States, for her work on refrigerants, cleaning agents, and aerosol propellants. She is a member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). She has chaired the AHRI's Research group and the AHRTI's Technology and Steering committees.
