USBE Data and Research 2017 Hurricane High's school colors are red and black. The school mascot is a tiger. History The first school classes were held in Hurricane in 1906 in the living room of Ira E. Bradshaw's home, consisting of grades one through eight. Hurricane's first high school class graduated in the 1927-1928 school year. A two-story red brick high school building was built during the Great Depression with help from the federal government’s Works Progress Administration. The building was completed and the school opened just after Thanksgiving in 1936. The school chose the colors red and black because those are the colors on a hurricane warning flag. The school then chose the nickname Tigers because it was an animal that could be rendered easily in black and red. In 1974, a new gymnasium and three classrooms were completed at the current school site, the first phase of construction of the current facilities. Students walked between the old high school building and the new building for classes. In 1978, classrooms and a cafeteria were added, and grades 9-12 moved to the new building. The old building remained in use for other grades until it was demolished in the spring of 2004. A new auditorium, auxiliary gym, and administrative office areas were added in 1996. In 2001, a science hall was added and named for the outgoing principal, Robert Goulding. The school's enrollment continues to grow and has forced a new expansion/remodel of the existing building. It was completed in 2011 and students started being enrolled in the new building in 2012. The new building has three stories. Darin Thomas is the current principal at Hurricane High School.

Valdez (T-AG-169), named after World War II Medal of Honor recipient PFC Jose F. Valdez, was a technical research ship in operation during the 1960s. The \\"Galloping Ghost of the Ivory Coast\\" or \\"Grey Ghost of the African Coast\\", as she was affectionately called by her crew, was deployed around Africa from 1961 until 1969. Army service, 1945-1949 Private Jose F. Valdez, originally Joe P. Martinez, was laid down by Walter Butler Shipbuilders, Inc., Duluth, Minnesota, 22 April 1944; was launched as Round Splice on 27 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Guy R. Porter; and transferred to the American Ship Building Company, Chicago, Illinois, for completion on 15 December 1944; and delivered to the U.S. Army for operation 16 February 1945. The ship was delivered to the War Shipping Administration for operation by its agent American Export Lines at New Orleans on 5 July 1945 and then allocated for operation by the U.S. Army under bareboat charter on 12 July. Round Splice was one of 35 C1-M-AV1 vessels delivered to the Southwest Pacific Area's permanent local fleet with arrival in that fleet between 14 September and 16 December 1945 with designation in that fleet as X-350 into January 1946. The Round Splice was transferred to the War Department 30 August 1946 and renamed Private Jose F. Valdez. Transfer to the Navy, 1950-1959 On 2 September 1950 she was acquired by the United States Navy, designated T-APC-119, and assigned to Military Sea Transportation Service. Manned by a civil service crew she operated in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean areas until August 1951. Between then and December she cruised the Mediterranean Sea and in January 1952 began runs to Newfoundland and Greenland which continued until she was ordered inactivated in late 1959. On 22 December she arrived in the James River National Defense Reserve Fleet berthing area and was transferred to the custody of the Maritime Administration. Technical Research Ship, 1961-1969 Private Jose F. Valdez was reacquired by the Navy in August 1961. Converted to a Technical Research Ship and reassigned to MSTS, she departed Brooklyn, her homeport, in November 1961 on the first of her extended hydrographic cruises to the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The USNS designation indicates that the ship was manned by civilians. A crew of approximately 55 civilians operated the ship while a detachment of approximately 100 Navy personnel carried out the research operations. The Navy detachment typically included three officers; almost all enlisted men were Communications Technicians (a rating that has been renamed Cryptologic Technician). An advantage of the USNS designation is that the ship was not required to return to an American port on a regular basis. Thus the first deployment of Private Jose F. Valdez started in 1961 and she did not return to the USA until 1967. Operation in African waters Since the \\"Happy Jose\\" did not regularly return to the USA, the crew was rotated by flying them to a major port city in Africa, such as Cape Town. This occurred on an annual basis. The old crew would be flown back to the USA. Private Jose F. Valdez was typically at sea for about 30 days and then spent four or five days in port. Some of the sub-Saharan ports of call, from West to East, were Dakar, Senegal; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Monrovia, Liberia; Abidjan, Ivory Coast; Lagos, Nigeria; Brazzaville, Republic of Congo; Luanda, Angola; Walvis Bay, Southwest Africa (now Namibia); Cape Town, South Africa; Port Elizabeth, South Africa; Durban, South Africa; Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), Mozambique; and Mombasa, Kenya. A brush with fate In May 1967 tensions were rising in the Middle East between Israel and her Arab neighbors; this resulted in the Six-Day War in June 1967. The National Security Agency (NSA) decided to deploy a SIGINT collection ship to the area to monitor the situation. Most of the technical research ships were too far away: and were in Southeast Asia, and were in South America, and was off Cuba. Choice of a ship for the operation narrowed between Private Jose F. Valdez, then headed from the eastern Mediterranean to Gibraltar, and in port at Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The NSA selected Liberty because she had superior cruising speed (18 knots vs. 8 knots for Private Jose F. Valdez), because her VHF/UHF multichannel collection capability was better, and because she was, unlike Private Jose F. Valdez, at the beginning of a deployment. On 23 May 1967 Liberty was diverted for duty in the eastern Mediterranean. Liberty stopped at Rota on 1 June and departed the next day for the eastern Mediterranean. Eastbound Liberty passed westbound Private Jose F. Valdez on the night of June 5/6. June 7 Contact X (Private Jose F. Valdez was Contact A ) removed from Libertys navigation chart. Seven days after arriving Rota, Liberty was attacked by Israeli forces and suffered heavy damages, with 34 crew members killed and 171 injured (see USS Liberty incident). Private Jose F. Valdez arrived in Bayonne, New Jersey in June 1967. Final deployments After repair and overhaul, Private Jose F. Valdez departed for her second extended tour in the African region on 18 September 1967. She returned to the USA unexpectedly early in September 1968 for installation of Technical Research Ship Special COMMunications (TRSSCOMM), a system that could relay messages directly to Washington by bouncing a microwave signal off the moon. This was not a new system; it had already been used on Liberty and Oxford. This system consisted of a sixteen-foot, dish shaped antenna mounted on a movable platform and capable of bouncing a 10,000 watt microwave signal off a particular spot on the moon and down either to the receiving station at Cheltenham, Maryland, or to one of the other Navy SIGINT ships. The TRSSCOMM had the advantage of being able to transmit large quantities of intelligence information very rapidly without giving away the ship's location to hostile direction finding equipment or interfering with incoming signals. But its major disadvantage is that it could only work if the moon was visible and the stabilization system worked properly. The third extended deployment commenced on 22 January 1969 when Private Jose F. Valdez transited to Africa via Recife, Brazil. Private Jose F. Valdez was ordered home later that year to prematurely end her final deployment. All the vessels in the Technical Research Fleet were inactive by 1970. Final fate The Maritime Administration assumed custody of Private Jose F. Valdez on 7 November 1969. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, 15 August 1976 and transferred for disposal. She, and three other ships, were sold on 27 July 1977 to Consolidated-Andy Inc., Brownsville, Texas for $309,999 and scrapped by that company later that year.

The phrase comes from a responsory of the Catholic Office of the Dead, in the third Nocturn of Matins: Medieval poetry Since the phrase \\"\\" was popular in medieval literature, and was frequently repeated in poetry, there are numerous poems that are conventionally titled because they contain the phrase. In terms of genre, poetry in this tradition frequently appears in the form of a meditation, or a sermon that employs exempla. In some cases, the poetry also took the form of a list (e.g. a list of different famous people appears within the poem). Although the list is not technically a form of genre, it is a common medieval literary convention. Several themes appear in poetry which are also frequently found in other medieval poems on the subject of death. A common theme is death's triumph over people no matter how great or powerful a person was in life. Another common theme is the uncertainty of when one's life will end. Poets invariably pointed out that there is no guarantee that a person will live from one moment to the next, and that death could strike suddenly and without warning. This naturally led to the theme of the immediate need for penance and good works. It was stressed that a person should not delay in seeking penance or doing good works, lest they should perish and suffer eternally in Hell for it. William Dunbar's \\"Lament for the Makaris\\", written around the end of the 15th century, employs the phrase at the last line of each verse. As its title indicates, the poem refers back to the titular medieval Scottish poets. > He hes done petuously devour, > The noble Chaucer, of makaris flour, > The Monk of Bery, and Gower, all thre; > Timor mortis conturbat me. > > The gude Syr Hew of Eglintoun, > And eik Heryot, and Wyntoun, > He hes tane out of this cuntre; > Timor mortis conturbat me. > In later culture The first eleven stanzas of Lament for the Makaris are quoted in Chapter III of The Worm Ouroboros, by E. R. Eddison, [1922]. In The Sword in the Stone by T. H. White, [1938] the hawks' Ordeal Hymn references the traditional form, but modified for the philosophy of predators > Life is blood, shed and offered. > The eagle's eye can face this dree. > To beasts of chase the lie is proffered: > Timor Mortis Conturbat Me. > The beast of foot sings Holdfast only, > For flesh is bruckle and foot is slee. > Strength to the strong and the lordly and lonely. > Timor Mortis Exultat Me. > The phrase is a refrain in Kenneth Rexroth's 1966 poem \\"Thou Shalt Not Kill\\". > What became of Jim Oppenheim? > Lola Ridge alone in an > Icy furnished room? Orrick Johns, > Hopping into the surf on his > One leg? Elinor Wylie > Who leaped like Kierkegaard? > Sara Teasdale, where is she? > Timor mortis conturbat me. > Jack Vance parodies this convention in his novel The Palace of Love (1967). Writing through his character Navarth the Mad Poet, he relates a poem in which the stanzas end in such examples as Tim R. Mortiss degurgled me, Tim R. Mortiss disturgled me, Tim R. Mortiss occurgled me, etc. David Markson's 2001 postmodern novel This Is Not a Novel may also be seen as an extended example of the genre. The Latin phrase appears, translated as \\"The fear of death distresses me,\\" and the novel's content is dominated by an extensive catalog of how hundreds of writers and artists died.

He is also a successful businessman and entrepreneur with profitable investments inside and outside of Kenya. Biography He was born in Nyaribari, in Kisii County on 6 February 1932 to the then powerful colonial chief, Musa Nyandusi. Nyachae's earlier exposure to western education was facilitated by his own father, himself a mission- educated graduate who used his strong influence and acquaintance to the colonial administrators to be appointed chief. Born into a large polygamous family, Nyachae was fortunate that his father developed a particular liking for him, more than his elder brother James Oiruria, who apparently was less talkative and outgoing than Simon Nyachae. In 1941, his father put him in Nyanchwa Seventh-day Adventist School and later in 1947, he joined Kereri Intermediate School. However two years later in 1949, he joined Kisii Government African School but in 1953, just a year before he sat for the then Ordinary Level School Certificate, he withdrew from the school and was employed at his father's chief's camp as a district clerk in 1954. He later attended Torquay Academy and Churchill College, Cambridge, both in the United Kingdom. As a civil servant in Kenya Simon Nyachae's long career in the civil service began at this point. However, in 1957, Nyachae's father realized that his son would be better off with higher education and that is why he arranged for his admission to study public administration in London. Upon his return to Kenya in 1960, Nyachae was posted as a District Officer in Kangundo Division and later returning to Churchill College, Cambridge for a diploma course in public administration. He became a District commissioner by December 1963. Upon his return to Kenya in 1964 he went back to provincial administration and from this point on, he steadily rose up the ranks within the provincial administration and ending up serving as a Provincial Commissioner (between 1965–1979 and later chief secretary in the Civil Service under the Kenyatta and Moi governments. Career in Politics On his retirement from the civil service, Nyachae was arguably one of the richest and most prominent personalities from Kisii County. During his tenure in the civil service, he had used his influence to amass immense wealth, most of it corruptly. Being the richest man in the county enabled him to gain political power and influence. Using his wealth, he easily vied for and won a parliamentary seat in 1992. His election to parliament 1992 in Nyaribari Chache Constituency was instrumental in his entry into the Moi government as a powerful cabinet minister first for Agriculture, then 1998 for Finance. In 1999 he fell out with Moi and resigned from the government after having been moved to the less influential ministry of Industry. He also left Kenya African National Union (KANU) to join the opposition FORD People, by then only a small party with some roots in Central Kenya and three deputies in parliament. In Ford-People Nyachae's plans to run for presidency did not find wide support as the main opposition groups cooperated with Mwai Kibaki's Democratic Party to form the National Alliance of Kenya which then teamed up with Raila Odinga's LDP to form the Rainbow Coalition. During the 2002 General Elections he did not succeed in his presidential bid but was able to enter parliament with a 14-member strong FORD-People faction after collecting all constituencies in Kisii. Ford-People was the only sizeable opposition party besides KANU in the 2002 parliament. Minister under Kibaki When president Kibaki's NARC-Coalition started to crumble the support of FORD-People became most welcome and in 2004, when president Mwai Kibaki was facing strong opposition from his cabinet he recalled Nyachae to government as Minister for Energy and later for Roads. Nyachae was named in the Waki report as one of the masterminds of the 2007-2008 post-election violence in which more that 1,600 people died. He was believed to have organised attacks on ODM opposition leaders. He ran and lost the 2007 parliamentary elections. The opposition wave swept his Kisii stronghold and Nyachae was soundly defeated as it happened to the majority of Kibaki's government ministers and nearly all Ford-People candidates linked to him. Business He runs a chain of business ranging from agriculture, banking, real estate, transportation and manufacturing based in all major cities in Kenya including Narok, Kisii, Kericho, Sotik, Kisumu, Mombasa, Nyeri and Nairobi. Family Prior to falling ill in 2018, 86 year- old Simeon Nyachae's family included four wives and over 20 children. In April 2018, Nyachae tripped and fell at his home in the Loresho neighborhood in north-west Nairobi, Kenya's capital city. He as initially admitted to Nairobi Hospital for one week. When he did not recover as completely and as fast as expected, he was airlifted to London, in the United Kingdom. He is expected to recuperate at his London home when he is discharged from hospital.

Throughout its 105-year lifespan, the store played an active role in the Richmond, Virginia community, along with its friendly cross-street rival Thalhimers. The Richmond flagship location was known for its \\"SantaLand\\" upstairs attraction, which has since become an attraction at the Children’s Museum of Richmond. In 1987, Campeau purchased Miller & Roads and later sold it to Philadelphia developer Kevin Donohoe and store management before closing in 1990.  Origins  In 1885, Linton Miller, Webster Rhoads, and Simon Gerhart opened a dry goods store in Richmond, Virginia. The store—Miller, Rhoads, & Gerhart—opened with an initial investment of $3,000. In 1888, Miller, Rhoads, & Gerhart moved to 509 East Broad Street. Simon Gerhart relocated to Lynchburg, Virginia in 1890 and opened his own store there. It was at this time that the nameplate of the Richmond store changed to Miller & Rhoads. By 1909, the Richmond Broad Street store covered nearly half a city block, and by 1924, it covered an entire block, stretching from Broad to Grace Street. During the middle part of the 20th century, the growth of Miller & Rhoads in Richmond was at its peak. The store was home to the ever-popular Tea Room, which featured regular fashion shows, and signature menu items such as the Missouri Club, Brunswick stew, and chocolate silk pie. As time progressed, Miller & Rhoads began to boast modern conveniences like a 1,000 car parking garage (shared with Thalhimers), air conditioning and escalators. The store also hosted famous writers, art exhibits and other community events that helped add a cosmopolitan flair to the city.  Santaland and the \\"real\\" Santa Claus  The former Miller & Rhoads at 501 E. Broad St., now a hotel and condominium complex Every Christmas season, a room on the seventh floor of Miller & Rhoads transformed into a magic wonderland called Santaland. The room was dimly lit, but thousands of tiny, white lights gave the appearance of night stars overhead. Woodland scenes with lifelike, animated animals were strategically placed throughout the room. Fully decorated trees adorned a path leading to the beautiful stage. Onstage were a huge fireplace, a Christmas tree, and a golden chair with a red velvet back and seat where Santa Claus sat. Santaland became so much a part of the Richmond store's folklore that the company began airing commercials with the tagline Miller & Rhoads - Where Christmas is a Legend. Even now, years after Miller & Rhoads closed its doors, Santa Claus still holds court in downtown Richmond, first shifting to Thalhimers in 1990, then to the Sixth Street Marketplace after Thalhimers closed, and currently sees children at the Children's Museum of Richmond. The Santa Tea's event is held each holiday season. The real magic of the Miller & Rhoads' Santas was that they knew every child's name - greeting them by name as they walked up to him - a tradition that lives on today. Stories exist of parents who've driven their children to Richmond from as far away as Texas - or grandparents who've flown their grandchildren from Colorado just to see THE Santa.  Postwar expansion  Between 1956 and 1960, Miller & Rhoads began to expand, opening stores in downtown Lynchburg, Charlottesville and Roanoke. The stores were full-line, multi-level operations that were traditional in design and included many features popular at the Richmond store, like the Tea Room. By the late 1960s, the chain also added new suburban stores at Southside Plaza and The Shops at Willow Lawn in Richmond, Walnut Plaza in Petersburg, Newmarket Shopping Center in Newport News, Southern Shopping Center in Norfolk, Pembroke Mall in Virginia Beach, Barracks Road Shopping Center in Charlottesville, Pittman Plaza in Lynchburg and Roanoke-Salem Plaza in Roanoke. Generally, the first wave of Miller & Rhoads' suburban expansion was smaller specialty stores that focused on family apparel, primarily ladies' ready-to-wear. In 1967, Miller & Rhoads merged with Washington, DC-based department store Julius Garfinkel & Co and New York-based specialty chain Brooks Brothers to form Garfinckel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads, Inc..  The suburban age  After successfully opening smaller suburban locations, Miller & Rhoads set its sights on large stores in regional malls. However, its first attempt at a larger store in the suburban Richmond market was thwarted because of a clause in a lease on an existing location. Because of a section in their lease at Southside Plaza that prevented additional locations within five miles of that shopping center, Miller & Rhoads was unable to be an anchor at Cloverleaf Mall, Richmond’s first large regional mall, which was only four miles away. In the mid-1970s, Miller & Rhoads opened three large stores in new shopping malls Regency Square and Chesterfield Mall in suburban Richmond and Newmarket North Mall in Hampton, with the latter relocating from a shopping center across the street. It also opened a number of specialty stores in Roanoke and Portsmouth, Virginia and Greensboro, Charlotte, Raleigh and Fayetteville, North Carolina. Miller & Rhoads continued to expand to other cities in Virginia and North Carolina into the early 1980s, relocating its downtown Lynchburg and Charlottesville stores into shopping malls and opening large new locations at Lynnhaven Mall in Virginia Beach and Greenbrier Mall in Chesapeake. Even as its stores grew more contemporary, the chain adhered to many old traditions. Miller & Rhoads stores almost always had engraved metal name plaques at their entrances, even on mall entrances. An early 1980s redesign of the store logo featured curvaceous script reminiscent of calligraphy.  The beginning of the end, and new beginnings  The former Miller & Rhoads The Garfinkel, Brooks Brothers, Miller & Rhoads company was acquired by Allied Stores in 1982. This marked a low point in the chain's history, as Allied closed many of the smaller stores, exiting the North Carolina market except for Raleigh, and began to neglect the maintenance on its larger stores in an effort to cut operating costs. Allied opened a small number of new, larger locations in Virginia. The downtown Roanoke store was closed in this period and replaced by a store at Valley View Mall. In an effort to revitalize the decaying downtown Richmond retail core, the city government, Miller & Rhoads, and Thalhimers teamed together in 1985 in the development of the Sixth Street Marketplace, an urban shopping center that took the place of the street that separated the two stores. Though it started out relatively popular, the downtown mall did not remain a success, and was razed by 2004. Miller & Rhoads' suburban stores continued to grow, but the downtown store's sales were generally stagnant with the exception of the Christmas season. In 1987, following its own ill-fated buyout by Campeau Corp., Allied sold Miller & Rhoads to Philadelphia developer Kevin Donohoe and store management, who began to renovate stores and plan a major expansion. At the time, Miller & Rhoads numbered 21 stores. Only two years later, in 1989, the company's future was dimming. Faced with increasing competition from stores like Leggett and Hess's and dwindling finances, Miller & Rhoads filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and by 1990, all Miller & Rhoads stores closed their doors for good. The May Department Stores Company purchased four of Miller & Rhoads' larger suburban units in Richmond and Hampton Roads for about $22.7 million and reopened them as Hecht's in late 1990. May would, in turn, take over Thalhimers that same year and eventually combine that chain with Hecht's as well. At both Regency Square and Lynnhaven Mall, Hecht's would operate two stores, one each in the former Miller & Rhoads and Thalhimers spaces. Hecht's eventually consolidated its Lynnhaven Mall stores into a single location, but at Regency Square, both stores were occupied by the chain until September 2006 when the Hecht's name was replaced with Macy's. Many of the remaining former Miller & Rhoads stores were converted to department stores like Montgomery Ward, Stone & Thomas and Value City or subdivided for other retail uses, while some were turned into offices and others demolished. In 2006, work began to convert the long shuttered Miller & Rhoads flagship store in downtown Richmond into a hotel and residential spaces. The old department store is now home to a 250-room full- line Hilton Hotel which is now the Richmond Hilton Downtown and 130 apartments or condominiums.

At in length, it is the longest river in Trøndelag county. The river follows the Orkdalen valley, discharging into the Orkdalsfjorden, an arm of the large Trondheimsfjorden, at the town of Orkanger. The river originates in the lake Orkelsjøen in the municipality of Oppdal in the Dovrefjell mountains. The river runs through the municipalities of Oppdal, Tynset, Rennebu, and Orkland. The municipalities are all in Trøndelag county, except for Tynset, which is in Innlandet county. Major towns and villages along the river include: Orkanger, Fannrem, Vormstad, Svorkmo, Storås, Meldal, Å (in Orkland); and Voll and Berkåk (in Rennebu). The Orkla is a popular river for salmon fishing, a famous fisherman there being former Liverpool player Vegard Heggem. About an long stretch of the river through Orkdal, Meldal, and Rennebu is used for salmon fishing throughout the season from June through August. The river is regulated by five power generation reservoirs, which were built between 1978 and 1985. The reservoirs have been a successful method of flood control preventing the river's major seasonal flooding. The decommissioned Eidsfossen Power Station stands along the river south of the confluence with the Ya River at Yset. Name The Old Norse form of the name was just Ork (still found in the names Orkanger, Orkland and Orkland). The meaning of the name is unknown (maybe derived from the verb orka which means \\"to work\\" - the meaning of the name would then be \\"the river that works its way forward\\"). The name Orkla (with the diminutive ending -la) originally belonged to the uppermost part of the river (lying in Tynset, Hedmark), and the meaning of this name is probably \\"the small part of Ork\\".

All the island residents participate by wearing folk costumes. The origins of the Lastovo carnival go back to a historical event. Legend has it that Catalan pirates attacked neighbouring Korčula and sent a Turkish messenger to Lastovo to tell the islanders to surrender or they would be next. The inhabitants of Lastovo did not let themselves be intimidated – instead they armed themselves and went on the attack. The women and children walked to Hum barefoot from Lastovo and prayed to Sv. Jure (St. George) for help and their prayers were answered: a storm destroyed the pirates' ships and the inhabitants of Lastovo caught the messenger. In order to mock him, he was taken through the village on the back of a donkey and was afterwards sentenced and burned to death. This event is celebrated through the Poklad every year over a period of two days just before Lent. The first recorded mention of the Lastovo carnival is from 16th century. In 1597 the Prince forbade the often riotous carnival crowd to bear arms. Those who disobeyed his decree ran the risk of being banished from the island.  Carnival tradition  A Pokladar shown in his traditional uniform As in other countries, the \\"carnival season\\" starts on Lastovo after the New Year on January 6 – the Feast of the Three Kings, and ends on the night preceding Ash Wednesday. (Because of the movable date of Easter the date occurs between February 10 and March 17). On the morning of Obese Monday the doll or puppet called Poklad is made. The festivities follow a detailed pattern: in the early morning on the Monday before Lent, the Poklad is made. The body is filled with straw and grain husks, while the feet are filled with sand from the local cemetery. The doll is then dressed – a red costume and fez hat – the face is drawn in with coal, and a cigarette is placed in the mouth. Afterwards, the carnival participants go from door to door collecting eggs and entertaining their hosts. On Carnival Tuesday (Shrove Tuesday) at eleven o'clock church bells halt all activity in the village. The carnival crowd, known as \\"Pokladari,\\" gather with and start playing their lyres. The carnival procession begins and is accompanied by the music until the end. The Poklad is placed on the village donkey judged to be the most beautiful. The flag-bearer of the Croatian national tri-colour, the doll on the donkey and the carnival participants make their way towards City Hall (in the past to the Dubrovnik Rector) in order to get permission to visit respected locals. The Poklad doll sent down the rope with firecrackers exploding beneath As they stop at the houses of the most prominent villagers singing and shouting, and performing the sword dance – similar to the more famous Moreška and Kumpanija from nearby Korčula – will take place on some of the locals' terraces. The carnival crowd who, up until the last century were armed with real swords, are followed at some distance by the \\"beautiful maskers\\" (girls in costumes and masks). The procession halts when it reaches Pod kostajnu (the tree growing in the middle of the village). A length of rope measuring over 300 meters has already been stretched between the pole set here and another mounted on the top of the hill in the background of the western side of the village. The procession climbs up to the top of the hill and the puppet is attached to the rope down which it slides three times, with petards cracking under its feet. Each time it reaches the bottom of the rope, the Poklad is met by drawn swords. After this, the procession heads to the parish church where they are joined by the masked women at dusk. Dancing with the \\"beautiful maskers\\" and a sword performance takes place at which also includes circle dancing all of which stops at the signal given by the Admiral. His gesture means that the Poklad must be impaled. The Pokladari set it on fire and start running with the puppet around the circle of dancers. Once the Poklad is burnt down to ashes, the crowd starts shouting, \\"UVO! UVO! UVO!\\" After this, the islanders head home and the church bells mark the end of the carnival.  Symbolism  The Lastovo carnival could be explained as a whole system of symbols. Culjanje, hanging and sliding of the puppet down the rope, as well as its death at the stake stand probably for the purification by air and by fire, i.e. for the ritual redemption of the community from the evil which had settled in the village during the preceding year. In the first joining of the carnival crowd by the youth and in the collection of eggs, the underlying pattern of the ritual initiation and fertility rites can be recognised. Lastovo is a typical farmers' and cultivators' community. The episode where the Poklad is lowered down the rope is observed with silent attentiveness because it is immensely important for the community that the Poklad should not slip from their hands or turn over on the rope. This would otherwise predict a bad year for the island's vineyards and harvests. Whether this is true or not, the villagers take this ancient carnival extremely seriously and it is in no way meant to be a \\"tourist attraction.\\" Lastovci from all around the world return to the island for this event every year and the participants take part in the festival with a certain level of pride.

Like most Georgians, Tamar initially remained an Eastern Orthodox Christian but is known to have converted to Islam at a later point, with no further information on how the conversion came about. It is said that the sun on the Seljuk coins of that time symbolizes Tamar, while the lion stands for the sultan himself. This emblem, known as shir-u hurshid (Lion and Sun), later became widespread in the Islamic world (though its origins date back to much earlier times). After the death of Kaykhusraw in 1246, the government of the sultanate was seized by the Pervane Mu‘in al-Din Suleyman who married Gürcü Hatun.

Born in Fethard, Tipperary, Ireland in 1806 or 1808, William Burges was a brother of John Major Burges (c. 1805-?), Samuel Burges (1810-1885) and Lockier Clere Burges (senior) (1814-1886). William was also an uncle of Thomas Burges, Richard Goldsmith Burges and Lockier Clere Burges (junior) (1841-1929). In 1830, William Burges and his brothers Samuel and Lockier emigrated to Western Australia on board the Warrior. Until 1837 they farmed together in the Upper Swan district. In 1837 the brothers obtained land at York. Their homestead, which they named Tipperary, is still held by their descendants. Burges travelled to Ireland in 1841, and returned to York in 1844. In 1846 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace. Appointed secretary of the York Agricultural Society in 1847, he was closely involved in that body's ultimately successful petition for Western Australia to become a penal colony. In 1850, he moved to the Champion Bay district, establishing the Bowes homestead. From 1851 to 1860 he was resident magistrate for his district, and in 1853 he was sub-collector of customs and visiting magistrate for the convict depot at Port Gregory. He returned to Ireland in 1860, but revisited Western Australia in 1868 and 1875. In November 1875, he was nominated to the Legislative Council. He held the seat until his resignation in July 1876. He returned to Ireland shortly afterwards, dying at Fethard on 16 October. He was unmarried.

History Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand was founded in 1974, two years after the original Greenpeace, to protect the natural environment. Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand emerged from an amalgam of 1960s and 1970s NZ peace groups and activists, who had for a decade been actively promoting their opposition to the Vietnam War and nuclear testing. In particular, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ) who were nationally campaigning against French nuclear testing in French Polynesia since 1961, culminating in an 80,238 signature petition presented to the New Zealand Government in 1962 demanding they take punitive action against the French to enforce a nuclear test ban in the Pacific. Two key NZ CND leaders in the 1970s involved with Greenpeace pursued political careers; Richard Northey ONZM as a NZ MP and Mike Rann CNZM as Premier of South Australia and Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability. Other groups in the peace collective included the NZ Peace Media, NZ Friends of the Earth, the Auckland Peace Squadron and Project Jonah.Making Waves the Greenpeace New Zealand Story by Michael Szabo There were two key developments in the New Zealand peace movement in 1974. The first was the official formation of the Greenpeace Foundation of New Zealand in April through the union of a collective of peace groups and their supporters. The second was the decision to send the yacht Fri on an epic voyage around the Pacific carrying the peace message to all nuclear weapons states. Fri’s Pacific Peace Odyssey, a adventure across the Pacific and Indian Oceans was partially financed and co-ordinated by Greenpeace New Zealand and would last till 1977. Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand gained national prominence in the 1970s and 1980s for its action against nuclear testing in French Polynesia, and acquired huge public sympathy after the French bombing of the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour in 1985. The long campaign against whaling championed by Greenpeace is an issue which has had the full support of the New Zealand Government since the mid-1980s. Campaigns Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand also campaigns against nuclear weapons and nuclear power, deforestation, the release of genetically engineered organisms into the natural environment, climate change, and toxics. It uses tactics of non-violent direct action to draw attention to what it considers significant threats to the environment, and then lobbies for solutions.  Clean energy economy  In 2011 Greenpeace head Kumi Naidoo expressed concern that New Zealand is moving too slow to realise its clean potential. In February 2013 Greenpeace released a report calling for New Zealand's energy production to be 100 percent renewable by 2025. The Future is Here: New Jobs, New Prosperity and a New Clean Economy report suggests New Zealand makes a dramatic shift to clean energy. The report was authored by a collection of European, Australian and New Zealand academics and policy analysts. This report states that nearly 30,000 jobs could be created through the expansion of geothermal and bioenergy industries, with geothermal potentially worth over NZ$4 billion annually to the New Zealand economy.  Tuna fishing reform campaign  Greenpeace had been involved in successful pressure to reform the tuna industry in the UK. Fish aggregating devices destroy much sealife as a side effect of fishing for one species. Greenpeace in NZ and Australia started focusing on local tuna brands.Greenpeace targets canned tuna in New Zealand Greenpeace campaigned for Sealord to put pressure on its supply chain to reduce the killing in other sea-life during tuna fishing. It culminated in Sealord making reforms to phase out tuna caught using fish aggregating devices (FAD)Sealord promise to end destructive tuna fishing welcomed, Scoop Media, 30 May 2013 Sealord announced it plans to remove the method from its supply chain of canned skipjack tuna by early 2014. These floating lures attract far more than adult tuna and this destructive method is said to be globally responsible for catching about 200,000 tonnes of other marine life every year.Sealord decision lauded by Greenpeace  Oil at sea  After the Bay of Plenty Rena oil spill Greenpeace volunteers assisted in cleaning up.Greenpeace volunteers team up with Maritime NZ Greenpeace and Eastern Bay of Plenty iwi Te Whanau-a-Apanui took the NZ government to court over its decision to grant an oil exploration permit to Brazilian oil giant Petrobras for deep sea oil exploration in the Raukumara Basin off the East Cape.

The law is invited to assess hypothetical outcomes, either affecting the claimant or a third party, where the defendant's breach of contract or of the duty of care for the purposes of negligence deprived the claimant of the opportunity to obtain a benefit and/or avoid a loss. For these purposes, the remedy of damages is normally intended to compensate for the claimant's loss of expectation (alternative rationales include restitution and reliance). The general rule is that while a loss of chance is compensable when the chance was something promised on a contractsee Chaplin v. Hicks it is not generally so in the law of tort, where most cases thus far have been concerned with medical negligence in the public health system. Contract03 06 08 10 12 16 27=Remedies In contract cases, the court is usually interested in securing the performance of what was agreed. Where one party is about to or has suffered loss as a result of the other's breach, the court offers practical protection to his or her expectations as to performance (in some cases, the use of injunction or specific performance may be appropriate). Where a party proves that he or she has sustained loss flowing from any breach (potentially including non-pecuniary or intangible losses, e.g. for disappointment, damage to reputation, etc.), the purpose of damages is, so far as money can do it, to place the claimant in the same situation as if the contract had been performed. Thus, the most relevant basis upon which to calculate any loss is to examine the economic potential of the contract as worded. This will provide a measure of what the claimant expected to gain, and so quantify what has been lost by the breach. Public policy As a matter of public policy, the law aims to respect the reasonable expectations of all parties involved in the dispute. The fundamental approach is therefore to uphold the validity of the contract wherever possible. Thus, there is no general protection offered to those who find they have entered into a bad bargain. All must accept the real outcomes of agreements entered into voluntarily (see freedom of contract). Even when there is a breach, the court will not penalise the \\"guilty\\" party (see Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd [1909] AC 488 which prevents the award of punitive or exemplary damages in a purely contractual action), nor will it strip away all profits made at the expense of the other unless the breach is exceptional as in Attorney General v Blake [2000] 3 WLR 635 which appears to create a wholly novel form of contractual remedy, namely the restitutionary remedy of an account of profits for breach of contract where the normal remedies are inadequate. The standard remedy is damages which are usually calculated by reference to the claimant only and do not reflect any form of penalty on the other(s) for exploiting the gullibility or innocence of the claimant. The law also recognises that unfairness may flow from inequality in bargaining power and addresses oppressive exemption clauses. Causation The primary difficulty in the calculation of damages is the question of causation. Remoteness will defeat a claim if it depends on very hypothetical possibilities. In McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission relying on rumours, the Commission sold to McRae the right to salvage an oil tanker thought to be marooned at the specified location. Unfortunately, the tanker did not exist. The Commission argued the contract was void because of a common mistake as to the existence of the subject matter, but the court noted that the Commission \\"took no steps to verify what they were asserting and any 'mistake' that existed was induced by their own culpable conduct.\\" McRae wasted money searching for the non- existent wreck. His claim for the loss of profits expected from a successful salvage was dismissed as too speculative, but reliance damages were awarded for wasted expenses.. Nevertheless, the courts have been prepared to speculate. In Chaplin v Hicks (1911) 2 KB 786 the defendant in breach of contract prevented the claimant from taking part in the final stage of a beauty contest where twelve of the final fifty (out of 6,000 original entrants) would be rewarded with places in a chorus line. The claimant was awarded damages for the loss of a chance, assessed at 25% of winning the competition. The court seemed to proceed on the claimant's statistical chance of winning (as if she were a lottery player) without any actual assessment of her physical attributes against any particular criteria of beauty. Yet Allied Maples Group Ltd v. Simmons & Simmons [1995] 1 WLR 1602 has partly restricted Chaplin v. Hicks. A solicitor's negligence deprived the claimant of an opportunity to negotiate a better bargain. The Court of Appeal held that if the client could show on the balance of probabilities that: (a) they would have sought renegotiation with the third party, and (b) that they had a substantial chance of negotiating (not necessarily that they would on balance of probabilities have negotiated) a better deal from the third party, then the court should quantify and award compensation for their loss of chance of doing so. Stuart-Smith LJ, at p1611, accepted the 'loss of chance' approach and regarded the case as one of those where \\"the plaintiff's loss depends on the hypothetical action of a third party, either in addition to action by the plaintiff … or independently of it.\\" This inclusion of a third party in the equation to quantify loss could have been taken as a general precondition to all claim of loss cases, but Lord Nicholls in Gregg v Scott [2005] UKHL 2 said, \\"It is clear that Stuart-Smith LJ. did not intend this to be a precise or exhaustive statement of the circumstances where loss of a chance may constitute actionable damage and his observation has not been so understood.\\". In Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali [2002] 1 AC 251 an employee made redundant by BCCI, claimed the usual statutory payments and, under the aegis of ACAS, signed an agreement to accept a sum \\"in full and final settlement of all or any claims of whatsoever nature that exist or may exist against BCCI.\\" The House of Lords held that this exclusion clause did not prevent employees from reopening their agreements when, following BCCI's collapse, it became clear that a significant part of the bank's business had been run dishonestly and the employees found that they were stigmatised for having worked there. When the parties signed the release, they could not have realistically supposed that a claim for damages in respect of disadvantage and stigma was a possibility. Accordingly, they claimed they could not have intended the release to apply to such a claim. But in earlier proceedings on the question of damages, the formidable practical obstacles presented by the limiting principles of causation, remoteness, and the duty of the claimant to mitigate any losses proved insurmountable. In 1999 Lightman J. tried five representative cases out of the 369 which had been initiated by former BCCI employees. None of them succeeded in proving that their unemployment was attributable to stigma. Indeed, subject to the anti-discrimination laws, a prospective employer is under no particular duty to employ anyone who attends for interview. Four of the cases tried by Lightman J. appear to have concerned employees who were dismissed by the liquidators when the bank collapsed in 1991. Those made redundant in 1990 faced the additional hurdle of having to explain why their unemployment was attributable to stigma when they were unable to find jobs for a year before any stigma attached to them. In this context, Johnson (A.P.) v. Unisys Limited [2001] UKHL 13 rejects any interpretation of Addis v Gramophone Co Ltd that might have prevented an action for damage to reputation or for psychiatric injury arising from dismissal, but confirms formidable evidential difficulties on causation: How, for example, would the employee prove that his psychiatric condition was caused by the manner of the dismissal rather than the fact of the dismissal which is within an employer's power for cause? More generally, the case holds that claims for breach of contractual terms cannot be used to avoid statutory preconditions to making claims for unfair dismissal. Recently, in Harper v. Virgin Net [2004] EWCA Civ 271 the Court of Appeal decided that an employee who was summarily dismissed, cannot bring a claim for damages for the loss of the opportunity to initiate a claim for unfair dismissal. If she had served the minimum three-month period of notice stipulated in the contract, she would have been able to bring a claim for unfair dismissal. But although there was a breach of this term as to notice, there was no loss of chance to claim. She had not gained the chance by actually serving the minimum statutory period of twelve months to qualify and the action for breach of a contractual term could not be used to defeat Parliament's intention in specifying a minimum period of actual service. Negligence While the award of damages in tort may protect pre-existing expectations (e.g. of earning capacity or of business profits), a claimant cannot be seen to benefit from the breach of the duty of care. The measure of damages is therefore to ensure that the claimant is \\"no worse off\\" having suffered the breach of the duty of care. In each case, the claimant must prove the cause of action on the balance of probabilities. For these purposes, the court is required to speculate on what would have happened had there been no negligence. In many cases, loss and damage might have been sustained even if all had gone as planned. But there might always have been a chance that no long-term loss and damage would occur. For example, a person may attend a hospital with an existing injury. The only effect of any negligence in the treatment may be that the patient loses the chance of a full recovery, i.e. what was merely threatened becomes inevitable. Thus, actions by claimants whose chances of recovery from illness or injury have been reduced due to the professional negligence of their doctors have failed when they could not establish that, with proper treatment, their chances of recovery would have exceeded 50%. In Gregg v Scott [2005] UKHL 2; [2005] 2 WLR 268 a man whose chances of surviving non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma for ten years were reduced from 42% to 25% by a delay in diagnosis could not claim damages because his chances were already too slim for the delay to have worsened his position. This was complicated by the fact that the case was brought before the court following an extended delay at which point the plaintiff was still alive. In judgement this was cited as a significant weakness in his claim. The principle is that a claimant must have had a more than 50% chance of survival to establish causation in order to satisfy the balance of probability test. However, in some Australian states, claims for loss of chance have been succeeded in medical negligence cases.. Their approach argues that a patient would rather have a 42% than a 25% chance of survival. If negligence reduces the percentage, common sense justice rejects a black-and-white approach to accepting or rejecting a claim based on an expert's opinion as to whether there was ever a 50% chance of survival, and prefers to offer mitigated damages to represent the loss of chance. In cases of economic loss, the rule that a claimant cannot normally recover for a lost chance is modified. In Kitchen v. Royal Airforce Association [1958] 2 All ER 241 a solicitor failed to issue a writ within the period of limitation in respect of a fatal accident. The surviving spouse sued for damages as she was unable to pursue her claim. There was no doubt that the loss was caused by the solicitors’ negligence and the only argument related to quantification of her claim. Although it was argued on behalf of the solicitors that the claimant might not have won her case, and may therefore have lost nothing, the court held that she had lost a chance and, as this was a valuable right, she should be compensated for it. Similarly, in Stovold v. Barlows (1996) PNLR 91 a solicitor acting for a vendor failed to use the appropriate system for sending the title deeds to a purchaser. Consequently, the claimant lost his chance to sell the property at a higher price. But damages were reduced by 50% as the court held that the purchaser might have bought another property even if the documents had arrived on time. In First Interstate Bank of California v Cohen Arnold & Co. (1996) PNLR 17 the claimant bank had loaned money to a client of the defendant accountants who negligently overstated the net worth of their clients. The bank then became concerned about the amount of the loan outstanding but, relying on the representations made by the defendant accountants, the bank delayed in calling in the loan. As a result of the delay in placing the property on the market, the price obtained was £1.45 million whereas the bank contended that it could have realised £3 million in an earlier sale. The Court of Appeal valued the chance at 66.66% on the assumption that “but for” the negligence, the property would actually have been sold for 66.66% of £3 million. In commercial cases, damages are assessed not on the outcome which the claimant would have sought, but on the economic opportunity which he has lost. The claimant must prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she would have taken action to obtain the relevant benefit or avoid the relevant risk. Once this has been established, the claimant need only show that the chance which he or she has lost was real or substantial. In Coudert Brothers v. Normans Bay Ltd. (formerly Illingworth, Morris Ltd.) [2004] EWCA Civ 215 the court reviewed two earlier authorities:Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons & Simmons and Equitable Life Assurance Society v Ernst & Young (2003) EWCA Civ 1114. The claimant, Normans Bay Ltd. was advised by Coudert Brothers in a tender for 49% of the shares in a Russian company, Bolshevichka, in 1993, but the investment was lost. NBL claimed that, \\"but for\\" Coudert's negligence, the tender would have survived. At first instance, Buckley J assessed that chance of survival at 70%. The prior cases establish that loss of chance claims require proof on the balance of probabilities that: #the claimant would have sought to secure the advantage which is the subject matter of the claim for valuation. #where the claim depends on the hypothetical acts of a third party, e.g. whether the panel of a beauty contest would have awarded a prize to the claimant, the claimant has lost a real or substantial chance as opposed to a speculative or fanciful chance. If both of these are proved, the court must assess that chance lost. If the chance was low, the court will award a low percentage of the value of the chance in damages; if the chance had a high probability of success, a high percentage will be awarded. On appeal the award was reduced to 40%. The court also dismissed Coudert's argument that its own negligence had broken the chain of causation because, to allow such an argument, would be to allow a party to benefit from their own unlawful act.

It was truncated during the 1964 renumbering and its signage removed in 1974. The highway is now mostly replaced with several streets in Los Angeles, State Route 2 (SR 2), SR 110, SR 66, San Bernardino County Route 66 (CR 66), Interstate 15 (I-15), and I-40. History US 66 was assigned by the American Association of State Highway Officials in November 1926 and signed in 1928 by the Automobile Club of Southern California; however historic US 66 shields and even present day US 66 shields remain. US 66 continued to be signed east of Pasadena until 1974, when it was removed, and the remaining separate section became SR 66\\\\. In 1977, \\"Hotel California\\" alluded to Route 66 in its opening lines, \\"On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair, Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air, Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light, My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night\\". According to Eagles guitarist Don Felder, \\"Everybody had driven into Los Angeles on what used to be Route 66\\\\. And as you drive in through the desert at night, you can see the glow of Los Angeles from a hundred miles away. The closer and closer you get, you start seeing all of these images, and these things pounded into our heads: the stars on Hollywood Boulevard, movie stars, palm trees, beaches and girls in bikinis.\\" Nationally, Route 66 has been a decommissioned highway since 1985, with the last section through Williams, Arizona, bypassed by I-40 in 1984. The first efforts to return the route to maps as \\"Historic Route 66\\" date to 1987 and Angel Delgadillo's Arizona Historic Route 66 Association. This initiative was soon followed in all eight US 66 states, including California. The California Historic Route 66 Association, established in December 1990 to advocate the preservation, restoration and promotion of historic Route 66 in California, is the youngest of the eight state-level Route 66 Associations. Because the sections of historic Route 66 that are within urban Los Angeles (San Bernardino to Santa Monica) are still dedicated streets, they remain as the most used and heavily traveled Route 66 segments. However, because of the heavy traffic and later non-historic development along these sections, they are generally the least traveled by Route 66 enthusiasts. Modern guide books that describe how to follow historic Route 66 frequently suggest that when arriving at San Bernardino from the east, enthusiasts should enter Interstate 10 as a bypass for these segments exiting near Santa Monica to experience today's terminus. Old Trails Highway 1916 Trails Arch Bridge spanning the Colorado River From San Bernardino to the Arizona state line US 66 followed the old National Old Trails Highway. The old highway veers away from I-15 between Victorville and Barstow, following the railroad through Oro Grande, Helendale, and Lenwood. Through Barstow, it is Main Street. East of Barstow, the National Old Trails Highway passes through a Marine Corps base, limiting public access and forcing traffic onto I-40. From Daggett, Historic 66 leaves I-40, crossing it three times before winding away through Bagdad, Amboy, and Essex. US 66 was all paved in California by 1935. This area is desert; towns like Amboy originated as Atlantic and Pacific Railroad stops and were sustained by Route 66 traffic during the Mother Road's heyday, then became ghost towns when I-40 bypassed them to the north. From Essex the highway was Goffs Road through Goffs until about 1931, joining I-40 at the US 95 exit. The later alignment is now I-40 east of Essex. The original highway winds around I-40 in the Needles area, before crossing the Colorado River into Arizona. Route description Will Rogers Monument near the western terminus of Route 66 in Santa Monica Santa Monica to San Bernardino The original western terminus of Route 66 was in downtown Los Angeles at the intersection of 7th street and Broadway Ave. In 1935, the route was extended to Santa Monica. In Santa Monica, US 66 started at the intersection of Lincoln and Olympic Blvd at U.S. 101A. Route 66 headed north on Lincoln and then turned east onto Santa Monica Blvd. which was, from the Santa Monica city line with Los Angeles up to US 101, added to SR 2 during the 1964 renumbering, the same name it had before 1936. In today's terms, it followed Santa Monica Boulevard until the east end, where it continued to the southeast as Sunset Boulevard up to SR 110 (Arroyo Seco Parkway), at the interchange with US 101\\\\. Running northwards on SR 110 to the northern terminus in Pasadena, the highway continued east onto Colorado Boulevard. When crossing North Baldwin Avenue, Colorado Boulevard becomes Colorado Street, and after it changes again to Colorado Place. Prior to the opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, US 66 began north on Broadway which curves east, ending at Mission Avenue. The highway then continues north on Mission which turns into Huntington Drive and then turns north onto Fair Oaks Avenue until meeting Colorado Boulevard where it turns east. After the extension to Santa Monica, the route moved to Figueroa Street from Sunset Boulevard to Colorado Boulevard until the opening of the Arroyo Seco. In Arcadia the highway continues eastwards through Arcadia, Monrovia, and Duarte as Huntington Drive, which it follows until the road crosses the San Gabriel River into Irwindale, becoming Foothill Boulevard after . In Azusa, the highway veers away from Foothill Boulevard, becoming Alosta Avenue. The city of Glendora renamed their segment of Alosta Avenue to Route 66; the highway is known as Foothill Boulevard again when it enters into San Dimas. Foothill Boulevard is numbered SR 66 from the interchange with SR 210 in La Verne onward until the road crosses into San Bernardino, where it becomes 5th Street. SR 66 ends at the 5th Street interchange with I-215 in San Bernardino. San Bernardino to the Arizona state line CR 66 sign near Amboy Route 66 highway sign, near Needles. US 66 originally exited San Bernardino on Mount Vernon Avenue and Cajon Boulevard, which meandered its way up to Cajon Pass. US 66 originally followed 7th Street and D Street through Victorville then the National Old Trails Highway through Barstow, California (where it took on the name \\"Main Street\\") and across the Mojave Desert to Needles. US 66 followed Broadway Street through Needles, then crossed into Arizona on the Trails Arch Bridge (1916-1946) or the Red Rock Bridge (converted from railroad bridge in 1946, abandoned 1966, dismantled 1976). By 1964, most or all of this part of the route had been replaced by three Interstate highways, the first being I-215, known as I-15 in 1964. It followed I-215 from SR 66 up to I-15. After I-15, the highway followed I-40 until it got to the state line with Arizona in Needles. Major intersectionsStructures=Restaurants Roy's in the Mojave Desert at Amboy Roy's Motel and Café was once the largest roadside business in what is now the desert ghost town of Amboy, California. The motel has been closed for years as the town died when Interstate 40 in California diverted traffic ten miles further north. Amboy, as a ghost town, had been used as a filming location for various movies. More recently, the Roy's filling station and café have operated at least sporadically in an attempt to preserve this landmark for tourism. The Summit Inn, a diner and filling station originally located in 1928 at the summit of the Cajon Pass, moved to Oak Hills, California when the highway was re-routed in 1952. Its visitors include Elvis Presley, reported to have kicked the jukebox and left without dining after finding none of his own records among the available selections. The building was destroyed by the Blue Cut Fire on August 16, 2016. The buildings current owners plan to rebuild the restaurant, as it appeared before the fire. Camps, motor courts and motels 66 Motel in Needles Route 66 has attracted campers since the Great Depression era, where The Grapes of Wrath describes a large but primitive riverside campground as one of the first sights when arriving in Needles, California from Arizona. Needles later became the site of the Carty's Camp cabins seen briefly in John Ford's 1940 film version of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" (now a deteriorating ghost tourist court) and the later adjacent 66 Motel (which currently offers long-term rental only). The 1924 Aztec Hotel in Monrovia, a National Historic Landmark in the San Gabriel Valley, is notable for its Mayan Revival architecture. One of three restored Wigwam Motels accommodates motorists in San Bernardino near Rialto. Based on a once-patented novelty architecture, these are tourist courts in which each cabin is a free- standing concrete wigwam. This group of motels served as an inspiration for the Cozy Cone Motel in Cars (film). Museums California devotes a pair of museums to the history of old Route 66, the California Route 66 Museum in the former Red Rooster Café in Victorville and the Barstow Route 66 \\"Mother Road\\" Museum in the town's former Harvey House Railroad Depot. Bridges The Figueroa Street Tunnels carry the Arroyo Seco Parkway through Elysian Park in Los Angeles; a Four Level Interchange connecting the Hollywood Freeway (Route 101) to Route 66 was the first stack interchange in the world. The historic 1916 Trails Arch Bridge spanning the Colorado River from Topock, Arizona to Needles, California still stands but is no longer open to traffic as the roadbed has since been removed to carry a natural gas pipeline.

An umpire is an official in the sport of Australian rules football who adjudicates the game according to the \\"Laws Of The Game\\", the official handbook of Australian Rules Football. Origins Statue of Tom Wills umpiring one of the earliest recorded matches of Australian rules football Unlike many other codes of football, where the official is called a referee, in Australian rules football the officials are called umpires. Tom Wills, one of the founders of the Australian game, was the earliest known umpire of a football match in Australia. At first the captains of both teams shared the duty of officiating games, however as the game became more professional in the 1880s, umpires became an important aspect of the game. Types A field umpire signalling holding the ball. A goal umpire officiating between the goal posts at one end of the football field. There are four different types of umpires and one type of steward in a typical game of Australian Football: * Field umpire - the field umpire (also known as a central umpire) is responsible controlling general play, and is positioned within the field of play. The field umpire is the only type of umpire permitted to award free kicks or initiate stoppages in play, and he executes ball-ups to restart play.AFL Law 8.2.1AFL Law 15.1AFL Law 11.3 Since 1994, professional level Australian Football League matches are policed by three field umpires. Amateur, suburban and semi-professional matches can be policed by any number from one to three field umpires. * Goal umpire - Goal umpires are responsible for all adjudications relating to the goal-line, to determine whether or not a ball has scored a goal, behind, or failed to cross the goal-line. Goal umpires also serve as the official score-keepers for the match. A goal umpire signals a score at his end of the ground by raising their index fingers in front of them at waist height, using one for a behind and two for a goal; then, the goal umpires at both ends wave flags to each to confirm and record the score. After each quarter, the umpires check their scores, and confirm that the ground scoreboard matches the official score.AFL Law 8.2.4AFL Law 12 There are generally two goal umpires in each game at all levels, one at each end of the ground; occasionally, the use of two goal umpires at each end of the ground has been trialled. Goal umpires traditionally wore a white jacket, black trousers and a broad-brimmed hat, however caps and shirts have replaced the hats and jackets. The caps they wear are generally lime green or grey. They are the only umpires to wear a cap. * Boundary umpire - the boundary umpire is responsible for determining when the ball has left the field of play, and whether it has done so on the bounce or on the full. The boundary umpire is responsible for throwing the ball back into play when it has left the field of play (a throw-in), and he assists the goal umpire when there is a set shot for goal by standing and observing from the behind post.AFL Law 8.2.2 In the professional level Australian Football League, there are four boundary umpires in each match with two umpires sharing control of each side of the ground. At lower levels, there are typically only two or three boundary umpires. A boundary umpire throwing the football back into play * Emergency umpire - particularly in professional matches, an emergency umpire may be provided specifically to be used as a replacement if an umpire is injured. The emergency umpire can also monitor the play from the bench for behind-the-play incidents, and can enter the field if required to break up scuffles and fights between players and enforce the blood rule. Like field umpires, they have the ability to report (or in lower levels eject) players. Oversees other officials, such as club runners, and interchanging of players. * Interchange stewards - although they are not officially an umpire, there are two of these at a match. They oversee the interchanging of players, and make sure no more than 18 players per team are on the field at any one time. Where league rules permit, stewards can report to the emergency umpire to allow free kicks to be paid for interchange infringements. Provision of umpires At the professional level, and at other high levels of the game, all umpires and officials are provided by the league's umpiring department. At lower levels, it is common for the competing clubs to each provide one goal umpire and one boundary umpire to the match, but field umpires are still almost always provided by the league. Modern umpiring and the AFL The game of Australian rules contains some \\"grey areas\\" where application of the laws is subject to interpretation, of degree or timing, making the job of field umpires extremely difficult. The instigation of new laws by the AFL in recent years, also contributes to the amount of work needed for umpires to maintain their skills and knowledge of the game. The umpires' director for the AFL is Jeff Gieschen, responsible for setting precedents for other affiliated leagues around the world. Attire Australian rules football umpires of all disciplines traditionally wore all-white uniforms. Goal umpires in particular wore a more formal attire of white jacket, white hat, tie and black slacks, as they were not required to actively run. More recently, umpires have begun wearing uniforms of a distinctive colour to avoid a jersey clash with any of the competing teams. As of 2013, all AFL umpires wore lime green uniforms with grey shorts or trousers, which avoids a clash with any of the league's teams. Additionally, field umpires in the AFL are identifiable by a jersey number. The most common historical pejorative term for an umpire, particularly a field umpire, was \\"white maggot\\", in reference to their historical white uniforms.Footy moots 'white maggot' ban, Sunday Telegraph, 27 April 2007 References * See also * List of Australian rules football umpires Category:Australian rules football terminology Category:Sports officiating ","title":"Umpire (Australian rules football)"},{"id":"4430286","text":"In Scientology and Dianetics, a \\"rundown\\" is \\"a series of steps which are auditing actions and processes designed to handle a specific aspect of a case and which have a known end phenomena.\\" List of rundowns=Cause Resurgence Rundown According to former church executive Mark Rathbun, it involves running, at your own pace, around a circular track until \\"you have a realization that you're in control of your own body and mind.\\" Clear Certainty Rundown A procedure in which the state of Clear is \\"validated and rehabilitated\\".

Cultural Anthropology, second edition. Stamford, Connecticut: Wadsworth Publishing Company (Cengage Learning). Conceptual Model of a Sociocultural System. The term \\"sociocultural system\\" embraces three concepts: society, culture, and system. A society is a number of interdependent organisms of the same species. A culture is the learned behaviors that are shared by the members of a society, together with the material products of such behaviors.

Minneapolis, MN: Future Systems Inc. The term sociocultural system is most likely to be found in the writings of anthropologists who specialize in ecological anthropology. In 1979, Marvin Harris outlined a universal structure of sociocultural systems.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Kefalonia, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It is located in the north-central part of the island. It has a land area of 81.112 km² and a population of 1,391 inhabitants (2011 census). The seat of the municipality and largest town is Agia Effimia (pop. 432). Geography In the north Pylaros borders on the municipal unit of Erisos, and on the border lies Kalo Mountain (901m) and Cape Agriosyko. In the south it borders on the municipal units of Argostoli and Sami, and on the border lies the mountain Agia Dynati (1131m). Pylaros forms a valley between the two mountains, and through it flows the river Xeropotamos. The valley of Pylaros is covered by forests, and contains many rare species of fauna. To the east lies the bay of Agia Effimia, and to the west it borders on the peninsula of Paliki. At the western frontier is the tableland of Falari and the Gulf of Myrtos. The beach at Myrtos has been voted the best Greek beach on eleven occasions, and is considered one of the best in the world. Subdivisions The municipal unit Pylaros is subdivided into the communities Agia Effimia, Divarata and Makryotika. It consists of 24 villages: { cellpadding=\\"5\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  *Agia Effimia *Makryotika *Divarata *Bekatorata  *Antipata *Logarata *Loukata *Drakata  *Markata *Vasilopoulata *Potamianata *Lekatsata  *Anomeria *Krini *Hamolakkos *Xeropotamos  *Drakopoulata *Feredinata *Tarkasata *Georgakata  *Karousata *Dendrinata *Rautopoulata *Siniori } Economy The economy of the municipality is based on tourism and dairy farming. In the tablelands of Kalo Mountain, and at the tableland of Falari the main industry is stock-breeding and cheese-making. In bygone days, many of the inhabitants of Pylaros were cheese-makers, and they travelled to Italy and Balkans to make cheese. It is sometimes said that in Falari they produce the best Greek Feta cheese. Agriculture is well-developed in regions next to Agia Effimia, but tourism is the most important source of income. The region in summer is a mecca for tourists from all over the world, and most of them go to the famous beach at Myrtos. There are hotels, rooms to let, cafes, taverns and shops with souvenirs. In the 19th century, many Pylarians were sailors, shipowners and merchants: they had many ships, and they travelled all over the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. But few people are involved in these trades today. History Pylaros has had a long and significant history, and even the name is ancient. It is thought that the name originates from the ancient words πύλη (\\"gate\\") and άρω (\\"pick up\\") --that is to say \\"pick up the gates\\", because Pylaros is between two \\"gates\\": the bays of Agia Efimia and Myrtos. The first historical indications we have are from the Mycenean age. Mycenean vases and huge walls from ancient fortifications have been discovered in Karousata, Logarata and Agia Effimia. According to a theory there was a sanctuary at Agia Dynati that, because of its shape (it resemble a rock covered with swadding-clothes) was considered to be the rock that Rea gave Cronus to eat to prevent him from eating her children, Zeus. When Zeus gained power, he obliged Cronus to throw the rock in the site of Agia Dynati. At ancient times, Pylaros must have been inhabited, but remains haven't been discovered yet. At Roman times, Pylaros was a region for amusement of Roman officials, which is proved by a Roman villa discovered in Agia Efimia. At Byzantine times, Pylaros belonged to the \\"Thema of Kefalonia\\", one of the prefectures of the Byzantine Empire. The most ancient monastery in Pylaros, the Moni of Panagia Thematon (from the word \\"Thema\\") and the yet undiscovered monastery of Agios Polatos, may have been built during those years. The time of Venetian occupation, probably saw the establishment of the first modern villages (Anomeria, Markata, Karousata, Antypata), and some families (Karousoi, Antypes) have been registered to the \\"Libro d' Oro\\". During the time of British occupation, Pylaros was a centre of great rebellions against the British. During World War II, Pylarians participated in the Greek-Italian war of 1940, the National Resistance and the Greek Civil War. At Pylaros, as all over Kefalonia, many Italians from the 33 Infantry Division Acqui were massacred by the Germans at the famous \\"Massacre of the Division Acqui\\", known from the film \\"Captain Corellis Mandolin\\". Many Italians were murdered at the site \\"Madria tou Lala\\", at Falari. During the Greek Civil War, some Pylarians were members of the communist Democratic Army of Greece and fought against the Hellenic Army. Two of the last captains of the Democratic Army, Matthaios Kouloubis and Ilias Kougianos who were murdered at September 1949, were Pylarians. (Kefalonia΄s Democratic Army was the last team of communist soldiers in action until December 1949). Finally in 1953, Pylaros was damaged by the terrible earthquakes that shaked the Ionian Islands. Some days later, the injured inhabitants were visited by the King George II. Famous individuals *Marinos Antypas (1873–1907) was one of the first Greek Socialists. He started off in Kefalonia, but later moved to Thessaly where he incited farmers against their landowners, which resulted in his murder in 1907. His example helped inspire the Great Agrarian Revolution at Kileler in 1910. *Evangelis Potamianos was fighter in the Greek Revolution of 1821. Traditions Pylarians have many traditions and customs. In the summer each village holds a religious festival or panigiri dedicated to a particular saint. Pylaria is the origin of one of the two traditional dances of Kefalonia, the Divaratikos. Pylarian is also known for its poetry, which is characteristically sarcastic.

Zest is used to add flavor to foods. In terms of fruit anatomy, the zest is obtained from the flavedo (exocarp) which is also referred to as zest. The flavedo and white pith (albedo) of a citrus fruit together makes up its peel. The amounts of both flavedo and pith are variable among citrus fruits, and may be adjusted by the manner in which they are prepared. Citrus peel may be used fresh, dried, candied, or pickled in salt. Cross-section of an orange. The flavedo is zested; the bitter white albedo or pith is generally not used. Preparation More orange flavedo than white albedo; contrast with orange, right. Zesting a lime; the white mesocarp is visible where some of the green flavedo has been cut away. Slicing mesocarp from flavedo to make marmalade, using a flexible filet-style knife. For culinary use, a zester, grater, vegetable peeler, paring knife, or even a surform tool is used to scrape or cut zest from the fruit. Alternatively, the peel is sliced, then excess pith (if any) cut away. The white portion of the peel under the zest (pith, albedo or mesocarp) may be unpleasantly bitter and is generally avoided by limiting the peeling depth. Some citrus fruits have so little white mesocarp that their peel can be used whole. Dried mandarin peel used whole as a seasoning (chenpi in Chinese). Variation between fruit The zest and mesocarp vary with the genetics of the fruit. Fruit with peels that are almost all flavedo are generally mandarines; relatives of pummelos and citrons tend to have thicker mesocarp. The mesocarp of pummelo relatives (grapefruit, orange, etc.) is generally more bitter; the mesocarp of citron relatives (Mexican and Persian limes, alemows etc.) is milder. The lemon is a hybrid of pummelo, citron, and mandarin. The mesocarp is also edible, and is used to make succade. Uses Zest is often used to add flavor to different pastries and sweets, such as pies (e.g., lemon meringue pie), cakes, cookies, biscuits, puddings, confectionery, candy and chocolate. Zest also is added to certain dishes (including ossobuco alla milanese), marmalades, sauces, sorbets and salads. Zest is a key ingredient in a variety of sweet and sour condiments, including lemon pickle, lime chutney, and marmalade. Lemon liqueurs and liquors such as Licor de oro require zest. Zest is used in some cocktails not only for flavor and aroma but also for color as a garnish. For use as a cocktail garnish, zest often is cut in a long spiral called a twist. Cocktails featuring a twist include Dry Martini and Horse's Neck. For maximum flavor and aroma, as in mulled wine, zest is simply cut from the fruit with a knife. Health The fungicide enilconazole (commonly known as Imazalil) is a known carcinogen widely used to grow citrus crops. An exposure standard governing the outer skin of a citrus fruit would likely differ from an exposure standard governing the fruit pulp. Depending on the chemical present and the degree of concern, a consumer might wish to wash or roughly scrub an item of citrus fruit prior to zesting the peel.

He was the president of the Beijing-based Jianhao Group. He was convicted of murder and executed in March 2006, after what appeared to be a feud with Sichuan businessman Liu Han (who was executed nine years later). Biography Yuan was raised in a peasant family and made a fortune in Beijing. Upon losing CNY 100 million in futures trading, he believed that his loss resulted from manipulation of the broker by Liu Han, a businessman from Sichuan. He offered a former police officer, Wang Xing, CNY 160,000 to murder Liu. Wang in turn hired a contract killer named Li Haiyang. In 1997 February, Li shot at Liu twice in a Sichuan hotel but missed, and was sentenced to life in prison. Wang proceeded to blackmail Yuan, who, with his brother Yuan Baoqi, hired their cousins to murder Wang in 2003. Yuan was found guilty of Wang's murder in 2005 January and was scheduled to die by firing squad on 14 October 2005. However, the day before his execution date, his wife transferred ownership of shares worth CNY 49.5 billion to the government, including shares of an Indonesian oilfield, leading to a stay of Yuan's execution until 2006 March. Yuan was executed by lethal injection by 2006 March, along with his brother Yuan Baoqi and Yuan Baosen. Another cousin, Yuan Baofu, received a suspended death sentence. The case regained attention in 2013 in the wake of the incident of Bo Xilai, when media outlets raised speculation about the proceedings of the case and the possible involvement of the former security official Zhou Yongkang, who, through his son Zhou Bin, served as a political patron for Liu Han. The media also questioned whether Yuan was indeed the culprit, and why his brother and cousin also needed to be put to death, raising the possibility that their punishments were influenced by Liu Han and his connection with Zhou Yongkang. In 2015, Liu Han was executed for other crimes.

It is based on the 1926 novel of the same name by Georges Bernanos, and tells the story of a devout priest who becomes involved with a murderess. The film is about mysticism and divine grace. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Donissan (Gérard Depardieu) is a very zealous rural priest of the Catholic Church in 1920s Pas-de-Calais, who nevertheless finds himself in spiritual and moral turmoil. He submits his worries to his dean Menou-Segrais (Maurice Pialat) and admits that he believes he is unfit to be a parish priest, as he nearly failed his seminary. Menou-Segrais reminds him that it is not too late for him to choose another vocation, but Donissan persists. Meanwhile, a teenaged parishioner, Germaine (also known as \\"Mouchette\\") (Sandrine Bonnaire), meets with her much older lover Cadignan, a marquis. Her father has learned of their affair and has become upset, and she begs him to take care of her, lest she run away. However, when he reveals that he must repay his debts and can only afford to provide a country home for her, she is bored and unimpressed; she declares that she will instead choose one of her other lovers, Gallet, a doctor who is married with children, and who can afford to keep her as a mistress in an apartment in Paris. Cadignan soothes her, and she stays the night. The next morning, Mouchette accidentally kills him with one of his rifles as she is playing with it. Guilt-stricken, she washes her bloody shoes before eventually meeting Gallet. After having sex with her, he ignores her repeated confession that she murdered Cadignan (as the death was ruled a suicide) and dismisses her insistence that he is the father of her unborn baby. Disappointed that he is more concerned with the idea of his wife discovering the affair than her impassioned threats of suicide and pleas for him to pay for her abortion, Mouchette departs. Menou- Segrais, annoyed at his parishioners' discomfort with Donissan, sends the latter to assist at a parish located in a village miles away. Donissan travels by foot and encounters a horse trader, who turns out to be Satan. After failing to seduce Donissan, the horse trader warns him that his unwavering faith is a temptation to sin in itself. Donissan faints and awakens alone before reaching the village. Eventually he encounters Mouchette, and experiences a psychic connection where he can see her life and thoughts, and insists that she must repent for her sin of killing Cadignan. Unnerved at his knowledge and warnings, Mouchette leaves, and is later so overwhelmed with his words and her guilt that she commits suicide. Donissan discovers her body and brings her to the church altar, where he disturbs Menou-Segrais and Mouchette's parents by laying it out and claiming that he is trying to save her soul. Donissan's superiors are outraged by his outdated actions and demand he be punished and transferred, but Menou-Segrais becomes impressed by his passion, and fights for him to stay at the parish. Donissan becomes uncomfortable when his faith makes him a local celebrity, and his moral turmoil continues. Eventually he is called to visit a sick child, but when he arrives, he finds the boy already dead. After an impassioned plea to God, the child is restored to life. However, this action, as well as his newfound fame, makes Donissan increasingly ill. One night he is attacked by Satan and asks God to keep him alive if there is still use for him. He recovers and returns to the church to hear parishioners' confessions. After the last parishioner leaves, Menou-Segrais goes to the confessional and discovers Donissan dead inside.

It was the third time a novel by Bernanos was adapted for film. The two previous adaptations, Diary of a Country Priest (1951) and Mouchette (1967), had both been directed by Robert Bresson. Under the Sun of Satan was produced through Erato Films, Flach Films, Action Films and Les Films A2. Filming began on 20 October 1986 and took place in Fressin and Montreuil-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais. Release The film premiered on 14 May at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, where it was met by boos and whistles from the audience. It also played at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival the same year. It was released in French cinemas on 2 September 1987. The film had 815,748 admissions in France.Jpbox-office.com Reception=Critical response Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times in 1987: > \\"Though it deals with theology and rises to a stunning test of faith, Under > Satan's Sun has a thoroughly secular style.

It was the first time in 21 years that the Palme d'Or went to a French film; Claude Lelouch had last won it in 1966 for A Man and a Woman. Pialat was congratulated by French President François Mitterrand, who wrote that Under the Sun of Satan \\"shows the vitality that can and should characterize French cinema\\". The film was nominated for the César Award for best film, director, actor (Depardieu), actress (Bonnaire), cinematography, editing and poster.

She was built at near the end of Long Wharf and commenced trials on 24 November 1879 from Meigg's Wharf, with 75 selected guests on a trip around Alcatraz and to Benicia. She could travel at about 12 mph, though on the first day of her trial did not exceed 8. She was constructed and operated by the Central Pacific Railroad to ferry entire trains (up to 48 cars at a time) on the Central Pacific transcontinental line to and from the San Francisco Bay Area. Once in service, the transcontinental railroad was re-routed to the sea level ferry crossing from its original course into the Bay Area via the Altamont Pass. Before her sister ship, Contra Costa, was constructed, Solano was the largest ferryboat ever built. Solano, named for the county in which Benicia sits, was built in 1878 in Oakland, California. She was long and wide and was capable of carrying entire passenger trains or a 48-car freight train and locomotive. She was in service from 1879 to 1930. Her sister ship, Contra Costa, was built in 1914 and also ran until 1930. She was slightly larger than Solano, and remains the largest rail ferryboat ever built. Contra Costa was named for the county in which Port Costa is located. By 1927, the two ferries had reached their maximum capacity. On 31 May 1928, the Southern Pacific (successor to the Central Pacific in operations of the ferries) authorized construction of a railroad bridge from Benicia to Martinez just east of Port Costa. The railroad bridge opened in November 1930 and continues to serve the Union Pacific and Amtrak railroads. Following the opening of the railroad bridge, Solano and Contra Costa were dismantled and sold for scrap. However, what remains of the Solano can still be seen where she was scuttled to create a breakwater in the San Joaquin River near Antioch, California.

He played 200 games and kicked 247 goals for the club between 2001 and 2013. Hailing from the small town of Brocklesby, New South Wales, Koschitzke was taken with the second overall pick in the 2000 AFL National Draft. He debuted in round three of the 2001 season and then played every game for the rest of the year, subsequently winning the AFL Rising Star award. Standing tall, Koschitzke generally played either as a ruckman or as a key- position forward. A number of his seasons were shortened by injury, especially early in his career. Koschitzke kicked a career-best 48 goals during the 2009 season, including one in the grand final loss to Geelong. He also played in the two 2010 grand finals against Collingwood, but had little impact. Career overview Recruited in the 2000 AFL Draft at pick number two, there were high expectations on Koschitzke from a young age. His athletic 197 cm build and strong marking were a great asset to the St Kilda Football Club, which drafted him and gave him his AFL debut early in 2001. He made an immediate impact and, in a debut year where he played 20 games, he won the AFL Rising Star award. In 2002 Koschitzke played just four games in an injury-riddled season. His quad and hamstring injuries continued to cause him trouble into 2003 and 2004 when he missed five and eight games respectively. Koschitske played in St Kilda’s 2004 AFL Wizard Home Loans Cup winning side - St Kilda's second pre-season cup win. In 2005, another injury-affected season, Koschitzke played sporadically until he made a return in Round 14 against the Western Bulldogs. In a best-on- ground performance he picked up 19 disposals and kicked three goals. His form continued when he kicked 16 goals over the next four games, but injury struck again after Round 21, causing him to miss the finals series. Koschitzke is considered a versatile key position player who can play at centre half-forward and centre half-back, as well as a ruckman. 2006 season In 2006 Koschitzke suffered further injury problems, first missing Rounds 1–3 with a minor knee injury and then missing Round 5 with a quadriceps injury. After being a surprise inclusion for Round 6 against the Bulldogs, he was knocked out by Daniel Giansiracusa with a legal hip and shoulder. He was diagnosed with a fractured skull and was expected to miss four to six weeks. But four weeks later he had not regained hearing in one ear and, for future health concerns, was ruled out for the remainder of the season. Coach Grant Thomas later said that if he did return to play in 2007, it would be an unexpected bonus. On 18 June 2006, Koschitzke collapsed while appearing on a live television spot for Channel Seven's program Sportsworld while being interviewed by David Schwarz. He was released from hospital later in the day after scans found nothing abnormal. St Kilda staff put the faint down to a number of factors including, fatigue, dehydration and a minor virus. There was no direct connection with his original injury and the collapse. 2007 season Koschitzke played 19 games in 2007, both in the forward line and the ruck, kicking 26 goals (season high four goals twice) and getting 155 hit outs (season high 21) and 116 marks (season high 10 twice). After significant time in the ruck, more of a forward role beckoned for Koschitzke after Fraser Gehrig announced his retirement. 2008 season Koschitske was captain in St Kilda’s 2008 NAB Cup winning side - St Kilda's third pre-season cup win. 2009 season Koschitske played in 20 of 22 matches in the 2009 AFL premiership season in which St Kilda qualified in first position for the 2009 finals series, winning the club’s third minor premiership. Koschitzke had one of his most consistent seasons in 2009 playing mainly at full-forward. He contributed to the Saints making the 2009 AFL grand final and polled well in the Brownlow Medal, finishing equal 11th. St Kilda qualified for the 2009 AFL Grand Final after qualifying and preliminary finals wins. Koschitske played in the grand final in which St Kilda were defeated by 12 points. 2010 season Koschitzke played 21 games in 2010, including four final matches, and kicked 30 goals. As of the end of the 2010 season, Koschitzke had played in 14 finals matches, including three grand finals. 2013 season In the round five match against the Sydney Swans, played at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington, New Zealand, Koschitzke kicked the first goal of the game and thus made history as the first player in AFL history to score a goal outside Australia.AFL Tables Koschitzke retired at the end of 2013 after an injury- riddled season. He was given a farewell match against Fremantle in round 23, when St Kilda had already been knocked out of finals contention. This brought him up to the significant milestone of 200 total senior games.Saints veteran Justin Koschitzke set for last stand Personal life Koschitzke hails from the small country town of Brocklesby, New South Wales in the Riverina region, where his family has run a farm since 1922.

Its center character is Gus, a football-playing mule. The film did well at the box office and was released on home video in 1981. Plot The film opens in Yugoslavia with the Petrovic family watching their son Stepjan winning a soccer game. Their other son Andy works on his farm, and can't play soccer at all, after falling into the well by accident. One day, Andy discovers Gus can kick a soccer ball long distances when Andy shouts, \\"Oich\\". Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the California Atoms are a professional football team owned by Hank Cooper (Ed Asner) and coached by the inept Coach Venner (Don Knotts). They are the worst team in the league and have not won a game in years. Cooper also owes a lot of money to two mobster bookmakers named Charles Gwynn (Harold Gould) and Cal Wilson (Dick Van Patten). When Cooper tells them he cannot pay his debts, the bookies give him a last chance bet: if the Atoms win the upcoming Super Bowl, all gambling debts will be forgiven, but if they do not win, Gwynn and Wilson will take ownership of the team. Desperate to draw in fans, Cooper looks for a great half time show. His secretary, Debbie (Louise Williams), sees a story in her parents' Yugoslavian newspaper about Gus. Debbie flies to Yugoslavia and hires Gus and Andy. After Gus is a hit in his first halftime show, Cooper and Venner decide to put him in the game as a place kicker. The other team protests, but as the rule book does not require a player to be human, Cooper allow Gus to kick, And able to kick a field goal from anywhere in the field, the Atoms win. The Atoms go on to win their next few games thanks to Gus, and move to first place in their division. The only catch is that Gus will only kick when Andy holds the ball and shouts the command. Debbie is assigned to watch over Andy and Gus, since she can speak Serbian. A romance begins between them, aided by Gus. Gwynn and Wilson, realizing their deal with Cooper is backfiring, hire two incompetent criminals named Crankcase (Tim Conway) and Spinner (Tom Bosley) to stop Gus from playing and make the team lose. Through their schemes, Crankcase and Spinner cause the Atoms to lose two games. Despite the losses, the Atoms make the playoffs. Andy becomes a celebrity, but his parents remain unimpressed, saying he only holds the ball for Gus. Before the playoff game, Spinner convinces Andy that Debbie has been injured in a car accident. When Andy arrives at the hospital, Crankcase locks him up. Without Andy, Gus refuses to kick, and the Atoms fall behind. In the final quarter, Debbie dresses up in Andy's uniform and convinces Gus to kick a field goal, scoring the winning points. Andy, who managed to escape, arrives after the game is over. He tells Debbie his father is right: Andy is nothing, and anyone can hold the ball for Gus. With the Atoms headed to the Super Bowl, Spinner and Crankcase steal Gus and replace him with an ordinary mule. Spinner and Crankcase check into a local hotel and lock up Gus with them and Gus breaks the TV and the hotel room door. At the Super Bowl, Andy quickly realizes the mule he has is not Gus, and he and Cooper leave by helicopter to search for Gus. When the two criminals watch the game on TV, Gus goes wild and escapes. In a long comic sequence, Crankcase and Spinner chase Gus into a local supermarket where they unsuccessfully attempt to recapture the mule. The criminals make a huge mess in the supermarket, including a bag of flour, stepping on bottles of Ketchup and Mustard, making a mess of themselves, destroying dinnerware on display, getting in the way of a strong man who beats one of them up, landing in a basket of balls for the children, one of them fell into a live lobster tank, and finally, attempting to ride Gus, who throws one of them into a huge ready made cake, destroying it completely. Running from the supermarket, Spinner and Crankcase are apprehended for mule napping and for causing an extended amount of damages in the supermarket. Gus is spotted from the air by Andy and Cooper. They airlift Gus to the Super Bowl and arrive in the fourth quarter. With Gus back in the game, the Atoms make a comeback. With 3 seconds left on the clock, the Atoms are down 16–15 with the ball on their own 5-yard line. Gus lines up for a field goal attempt, but slips in the mud and misses the football. In the scramble for the ball, Gus knocks it over to Andy, who runs 95 yards for the touchdown. Andy and team walk off the field to celebrate their win.

This was also the final film appearance of Virginia O'Brien. Reception Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and wrote, \\"Two different kinds of movies have been coming out of the Walt Disney organization in the last few years: Inventive, entertaining fantasies like Escape to Witch Mountain and The Island at the Top of the World, and dreary retreads of tired old Disney formulas. 'Gus,' alas, is in the retread category.\\" Richard Eder of The New York Times called it \\"a decently average Disney film, with a few funny parts and other parts where you would agree to smile if you could.

The New York Times. 11.

Gary Arnold of The Washington Post found the film's pace \\"sluggish\\" and added, \\"After a while it becomes impossible to share the kids' glee in the sort of pratfall you can see coming 10 seconds in advance.\\" He conceded, however, that \\"there's no point in denying or fighting the kick children get out of even mediocre slapstick.\\"Arnold, Gary (July 15, 1976). \\"Putting Some Kick in Movie Comedy\\".

The MNAA has one of the largest art collections in the world, with over 40,000 items spanning a vast collection of painting, sculpture, goldware, furniture, textiles, ceramics, and prints.Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga - About MNAA History It is one of the most visited museums in Portugal. The MNAA was founded in 1884 to display the collections of the Portuguese Royal Family and the National Academy of Fine Arts. It is housed in the Palácio Alvor- Pombal, a former residence of the 1st Marquis of Pombal which was expanded when it was converted into a museum. The museum's collection spans more than a millennium of art from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas and includes notable masterpieces by Hieronymus Bosch, Raphael, Hans Holbein the Elder, Francisco de Zurbarán, Albrecht Dürer, Domingos Sequeira, and Giambattista Tiepolo, among numerous others.  History =Origins MNAA annex from the Tagus River. The Sala Patiño (Patiño Room). Gardens of the Alvor-Pombal wing of the MNAA, facing the Tagus river. The Museum has its roots in the 1833 abolition of religious orders and confiscation of the monasteries in Portugal, which brought a trove of religious art and ornaments into the public sphere.1868 catalog of the Galeria Nacional At the instigation of the liberal politician Passos Manuel, the Academia de Bellas Artes (\\"Academy of Fine Arts\\") was founded in 1836, and established its headquarters at the former monastery of São Francisco da Cidade (near the Chiado). Although primarily dedicated to nurturing new artists, that same year, the Academia founded the Galeria Nacional de Pintura (\\"National Gallery of Painting\\") on the lower levels of the same building, as a subsidiary division to select, care for and display some of the better pieces of the expropriated monastic art then in government storage. An Academia panel selected some 540 paintings for the Galeria. Predictably, most of these were religious-oriented pieces of Portuguese origin. In the chaos and aftermath of the Portuguese Liberal Wars, some of the private art collections of ruined noble families were expropriated or found their way on to the market. Of particular significance was the painting collection of the disgraced former queen, the late Carlota Joaquina, which was acquired by the Portuguese government and given to the Academia in 1859. The former king Ferdinand II of Portugal, a connoisseur of fine arts, took an interest in the budding organization, secured its royal sponsorship (it was renamed Academia Real de Belas Artes in 1862) and, in 1865-67, Ferdinand II made a series of substantial cash donations, giving the Galeria an independent acquisition budget, enabling it to purchase pieces on the art market. On the initiative of Francisco de Sousa Holstein (son of the 1st Duke of Palmela, a vice-inspector of the Academia Real, in 1868, the Galeria's rooms were remodelled into a better exhibition space for its expanding collection and opened to the general public. Nonetheless, the facilities remained inadequate - it was terribly humid, cramped and still traversed by unrelated visitors to the Academia (which had, by now, become something of a social hang-out for dissheveled bohemian artists and students). In 1875, a commission headed by Sousa Holstein recommended the founding of a larger and more permanent museum away from the Academia's Chiado building. In 1881, the Academia's educational division was split off and turned into the Escola Real de Belas-Artes (\\"Royal School of Fine Arts\\", now part of the University of Lisbon), with the Academia Real de Belas-Artes proper limited to cultural pursuits.entry at the Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo In 1881, Academia officer Delfim Guedes rented the 17th-century Palace of Janelas Verdes (\\"Green Windows\\"), the former Lisbon residence of the Counts of Alvor that had been seized by the Marquis of Pombal after 1759 and sold to his own brother, the Cardinal-Inquisitor Paulo António de Carvalho e Mendonça (thus it is also known as the Palace of Pombal-Alvor). Later sold to the neighboring Carmelite convent of Santo Alberto, the palace returned to private hands following the 1833 dissolution. Guedes intended to use it as a temporary space for an international exhibition on Iberian ornamental art (\\"Exposição Retrospectiva de Arte Ornamental Portuguesa e Espanhola\\") organized by the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria & Albert) in London, that was set to visit Lisbon in 1882. Foundation Atrium of the MNAA annex hall. Portuguese Renaissance paintings. The government formally purchased the Janelas Verdes palace in June, 1884, and recast it as the Museu Nacional de Belas-Artes e Arqueologia (\\"National Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology\\"), formally founded on 11 May 1884, to house what where then known as the \\"Museus Centrais\\" of the State and placed it under the management of the Academia Real. Following the republican 1910 revolution, the arrangement was overhauled and the museum's management stopped depending on the Academia Real (now renamed Academia Nacional de Belas Artes). By a decree of 26 May 1911, the collections were split up and two separate and independent museums created - the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (\\"National Museum of Ancient Art\\"), at the Palace of Janelas Verdes, and the Museu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea\\" (\\"National Museum of Contemporary Art\\") at the old location of the Academia's Galeria at São Francisco da Cidade (since renamed the Chiado Museum). The latter collection's cut-off date was roughly 1850, everything prior to that assigned to Arte Antiga. The MNAA's first museum director was the energetic José de Figueiredo, who promptly began reforming the museum based on the latest planning and exhibition principles and re-orienting it decisively towards painting. Figueiredo was the first to study and identify the authorship and significance of Saint Vincent Panels, a 15th-century polyptych discovered c. 1882 and attributed by Figueiredo to Nuno Gonçalves.* José de Figueiredo (1910) O Pintor Nuno Gonçalves. Lisbon: Tip. Annuario Commercial. The St. Vincent panels were installed in the museum by 1916 and remain perhaps its best known piece. In 1940, the MNAA expanded its installations by acquiring the neighboring old convent of Santo Alberto and turned it into an annex connected by a footbridge. The chapel of the convent, a fine example of 18th Portuguese Baroque art and architecture, was incorporated into the exhibits. Collection The collection includes painting, sculpture, metalwork, textiles, furniture, drawings, and other decorative art forms from the Middle Ages to the early 19th century. The collections, especially those for the 15th and 16th centuries, are particularly important regarding the history of Portuguese painting, sculpture, and metalwork. Painting ;European The European painting section of the museum is significant and is represented by Jacob Adriaensz Backer, Bartolomé Bermejo, Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony by Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, David Gerard, Saint Jerome in His Study by Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, Piero della Francesca, Jan Gossaert, Hans Holbein the Elder, Pieter de Hooch, Adriaen Isenbrandt, Quentin Metsys, Hans Memling, Antonis Mor, Joachim Patinir, Jan Provost, Raphael, José Ribera, Andrea del Sarto, David Teniers the Younger, Tintoretto, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez, David Vinckeboons, Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom, Francisco de Zurbarán, François Boucher, Nicolas Poussin and others.

The six large panels show people from all levels of late medieval Portuguese society venerating Saint Vincent, in one of the first collective portraits in European art. There are sixty portraits on the panels. The museum also has important works by early 16th-century painters active in Portugal, such as, Jorge Afonso, Vasco Fernandes, Garcia Fernandes, Francisco de Holanda, Cristóvão Lopes, Gregório Lopes, Cristovão de Figueiredo, Francisco Henriques, and others. Painting from the 17th through the early 19th centuries is well represented by works that include those of Josefa de Óbidos, Vieira Portuense, and Domingos Sequeira.

Duncanville ISD serves almost all of the city of Duncanville and portions of DeSoto, Dallas, and Cedar Hill. The district is receiving a high number of Hispanics coming in, and a slightly decreasing number of African Americans. This can be due to the Hispanics moving in from areas such as Oak Cliff and South Dallas, and African Americans moving to areas such as Cedar Hill, DeSoto, and to a lesser extent, Midlothian. In 2009, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency.  Demographics  In 1997 48.62% of the district's student body was non-Hispanic white. From 1997 until 2016 the number of non-Hispanic white students declined by 87%. From 1997 to 2016 the number of students on free or reduced lunches, a way of designating someone as low income, increased by 204%.

The surviving bottom portion of the tablet was discovered in 1528 by a draper in his vineyard on Croix-Rousse Hill (on the site of the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls) in Lyon, France. It currently resides in the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon. Claudius had particular affinities with Lugdunum (Lyon). He was born there, and it housed the Imperial cult centre: as both Emperor and a \\"native\\" of the city, he was probably seen as its patron. He made the inscribed speech before the Roman Senate in 48 AD. It was a proposal to allow monied, landed citizens from further Gaul to enter the Senatorial class, and thus the Senate itself, once they had reached the necessary level of wealth. His argument evoked the Sabine origins of his own family, the gens Claudia, and the recent promotion to senatorial rank of men from Gallia Narbonensis. The text gives important insight into both the character of Claudius and Senate-emperor relations. Claudius goes into a long-winded digression on the early history of Rome – one which shows the effect of his tutelage under the historian Livy. This kind of pedantry is characteristic of Claudius and immediately identifies him as the speaker. Several interjections by senators are also recorded, mostly urging Claudius to get to the point. The style and substance of the speech suggest that Claudius was willing to publish himself as a scholarly, pedantic, tolerant upholder of ancient senatorial rights and values, eager to extend the same privileges to worthy provincials. The speech also contains references to other events during Claudius' reign, such as the fall of Valerius Asiaticus, whom Claudius singles out for condemnation. In his Annals, the later historian Tacitus reports a different version of the speech,Tacitus, Annales, XI, 23-24 probably based on various sources – including senatorial records – coupled with his own observations and the analysis of hindsight. His text broadly reaches the same conclusions but otherwise differs considerably from the version presented in the Lyon tablet, which includes many circumstantial details and may have been a verbatim transcript from an original Senate document. The proposal was carried by the Senate. The elite of Lugdunum may have had the tablet made to celebrate their new status and as a demonstration of their gratitude. Claudius is known to have visited the city in 43 AD and in 47 AD.

This dance has been traditionally designed for men although women may take part if there are not enough men. The (mee tuu paki resembles a kind of war dance; albeit, it is done with little symbolic paddles as opposed to arms. Dress The dress for this dance invariably is a large sheet of ngatu wrapped around the body from chest to ankles. A girdle of leaves around the waist (sisi) is often added. Movements The movements are largely with the paddles in the hand, but the proper addition of the small and subtle movements with the head and legs make the difference between a good and poor performance. The paddles are not used for row like gestures, but are rotated around, moved to left and right or up and down. The dancers start in one row, maybe two if there are many, but from time to time split up the rows in what seems chaotic movements, yet at the end they come back again in perfect unison. Music It is usually the dance master who operates a little slit drum (lali) to keep the beat, while the dancers themselves sing the song, possibly with assistance of others. The beat is always slow in the beginning, but goes faster and faster when the end approaches to excite the dancers and the public. History The words of the songs are in a largely unintelligible language, although some sailor terms can be distinguished. As there is also a version of the meetuupaki in Futuna, called tapaki even though different, a link in that direction seems to be most likely. The theory is that the meetuupaki was composed somewhere in the 12th to 16th century by an internationally oriented poet on Uvea to honour the Tui Tonga empire. When the Tui Tonga Kauʻulufonua I (Kauulufenua-fekai, K. the wild, in Futunan) had lost some decisive battles, which heralded the end of the empire and of the political function of the Tui Tonga, he was forced to give meetuupaki to Futuna, where the parts are still guarded as secrets. In addition the Futunans declared that from now on the Tui Tonga title should be inferior to any Futunan title, and if ever a Tongan boat would make it to their island, it would be destroyed and offered to the gods. (This still happened in the 19th century as recorded by William Mariner (writer). A Tongan proverb: vete fakafutuna (take apart in the Futunan way), still refers to something to be dismantled completely. There is also a theory that the meetuupaki was a kind of Tongan passport of olden times. When a boat from Tonga arrived on one of the conquered islands the crew was invited to show their typical dance to prove that they came from Tonga and not from somewhere else. As they then still had their paddles in their hand, using them in a dance seem quite straight forward. Verses Verse 1 :Kolulu e, Kolulu e :Kolulu e, sua mai mate :Fakapo, sua mai.

He managed to expand his borders towards the south; defeating the Albanian duke Karl Thopia. Early 15th century banner of the Balšić noble family depicting the founder of the dynasty, Balša I and his sons: Đurađ I, Balša II and Stracimir. He was a member of the Balšić noble family, which ruled Zeta (with Scutari) from ca. 1362 to 1421. Early life Balša II was the youngest of three sons of Balša. According to Mavro Orbini, Balša, the progenitor of the Balšić family, was a petty nobleman who held only one village in the area of Lake Skadar during the rule of Emperor Dušan the Mighty (r. 1331-1355). Only after the death of the emperor, during the subsequent weak rule of Emperor Uroš V, Balša together with his friends and his three sons (Stracimir, Đurađ and Balša II) gained power in Lower Zeta, which had previously been the lands of gospodin Žarko (fl. 1336-1360). Balša's people then turned for Upper Zeta, which was held by Đuraš Ilijić and his relatives; the Balšić brothers murdered Đuraš, and had some of his relatives imprisoned. Balša died the same year. Orbini further described the personalities of the brothers, claiming that Balša II was \\"good-natured and an accomplished horseman, but not of great mind\\". The Balšići managed to elevate themselves from petty nobility to provincial lords,Recueil de travaux de l'Institut des études byzantines: Volume 21 1982, \\"За разлику од Лазаревића, Бранковића и Драгаша, ближих или даљих рођака Немањића и потомака најугледцијих властеоских породица, први Балшићи су прави скоројевићи који су из редова ситне властеле доспели ...\\" becoming powerful after 1362, and it seems that they had an active part in the conflict between Emperor Uroš V and Simeon Uroš in Skadar, helping Uroš V. Seal of the Balšić brothers, January 17, 1368. In January 1368, a Ragusan document reported that the three Balšić brothers: Stracimir, Đurađ and Balša II, were preparing for a campaign against Karlo Thopia. They were camped on the Mati River, of which Karlo's lands lay south of. The fighting was apparently small-scale as two months later, Karlo had no difficulty capturing Dyrrhachium from the Angevins. In 1372, Balša II married Komnina, the daughter of Andrea II Muzaka, Despot of Berat and Valona. As a dowry, Balša gained the cities of Valona, Berat and Kanina (in modern-day southern Albania), located in Asen's province.Fine 1994, p. 372 Reign On January 13, 1378, he came to power in Zeta after the death of his older brother, Đurađ I. His power was felt only in the region around Scutari and in the eastern part of Zeta's coast. The most prominent feudal lords who did not recognize Balša's rule were their sworn enemies, the Đurašević-Crnojević family, who were allies of the Republic of Venice. In 1385, Balša II started the war for the conquest of Durazzo, taking it following four attempts. In 1385, the defeated ruler Karl Topia appealed to Murat I for assistance, and the Ottoman Army led by Hajruddin Pasha routed the Balšići at the Battle of Savra, on the Saurian field, near Lushnjë. The Ottomans chopped Balša's head off and sent it as an exclusive gift to Hajreddin Pasha. This marks the end of the rule of his family over Durazzo. Siege of the city of Kotor by Balsa II Aftermath Balša's widow, Komnina, and their daughter Ruđina, later took control of Balša's territory in southern Albania to protect it from Turkish invaders. Komnina seemed to be the Duchy of Valona's main ruler, until her death in 1396. In the meantime, the Muzaka family had gained control of Berat. In 1391, however, Ruđina married Mrkša Žarković. Žarković succeeded the duchy, calling himself Lord of Valona. He reigned over the city until his death in 1414. Ruđina took over her late husband's position and ruled Valona until 1417, when it, as well as its citadel in Kanina, was seized by the Turks.Fine 1994, p. 391 Ruđina fled Albania and sought asylum in Zeta.

The most popular and widely used of these cards was Apple Computer's Super Serial Card, a solid design that was often copied for maximum software compatibility of the end product.  Apple II Communications Card - Apple Computer  The Apple II Communications Card is the original serial card from Apple Computer. Released in 1978 for $225, it was designed to work with modems utilizing acoustic couplers. It offered speeds of 110 and 300 bit/s but with a simple hardware modification (described in the manual accompanying the card) one could change this to 300 and 1200 bit/s, or 1200 and 4800 bit/s.  Apple II Serial Interface Card - Apple Computer  The Apple II Serial Interface Card was released by Apple Computer shortly after the Communications Card, in August 1978. Designed for printing, this card had ROM revisions, P8 and P8A. The P8A ROM supported handshaking while the earlier P8 rom didn't. Unfortunately the P8A ROM revision was not compatible with some printers that worked under the original P8 ROM.  Serial Pro - Applied Engineering  The Serial Pro serial interface card from Applied Engineering was Super Serial Card compatible, however it eliminated the need for the use of a jumper block if the user wanted to switch between Printer mode or Modem mode. The Serial Pro, being a multifunction card, included a ProDOS and DOS 3.3 compatible clock/calendar thus combining the capabilities of two cards into one, freeing up an extra slot for those with highly populated machines. This card was unique in the sense that it did not use \\"Phantom Slots\\" to achieve this functionality. Previous multifunction cards required that a secondary function be \\"mapped\\" to a different slot in the computer's memory, rendering that slot unusable. If used with a dot-matrix printer, the Serial Pro offered several screen-print variations. It could print either HiRes page (or both in a single dump) normally, or print page one rotated or inverted. The Serial Pro utilized the MOS Technology 6551 ACIA chip and offered serial baud rates from 50 bit/s to 19,200 bit/s. The lifespan of the clock battery was touted as 20 years. The card retailed for $139 during the late 1980s. Applied Engineering Spring/Summer '88 Catalog For more on the Serial Pro's clock capabilities, see its entry in Apple II system clocks.  Super Serial Card - Apple Computer  The Super Serial Card Apple Computer's Super Serial Card, sometimes abbreviated as \\"SSC\\", is the most well known communication card made for the Apple II. Apple called it \\"Super\\" because it was able to function as both of Apple's previous cards, the Apple II Communications Card for modem use and the Apple II Serial Interface Card for printer use. A jumper block was used to configure the card for each of the two modes. The card has a maximum speed of 19,200 bit/s and is compatible with both ROM revisions of the Apple II Serial Interface Card. Reliable communications at 9600 bit/s and higher required disabling of interrupts. The card can actually run at 115,200 bit/s as well, using undocumented register settings; but speeds between 19,200 and 115,200 are not possible using this technique. The Super Serial Card was released in 1981 and utilizes the MOS Technology 6551 serial communications chip.

History Sir Auckland Colvin, Lieutenant Governor of the North West Provinces, while functioning as Lieutenant Governor of Avadh and Agra in 1889, conceived the idea of a school with the object of imparting education to the children of the British administrators and the landed aristocracy who were known as Taluqdars. The 'wards' class, founded in 1884, formed the nucleus for the establishment of the Taluqdars' College. The first Principal was Henry George Impey Siddons, the son of a Captain in the Indian Army, who graduated at Oxford and returned to India to teach. From 1875 to 1884 he had been first headmaster, then principal of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh, subsequently holding other teaching posts in India. Only when the British left India in 1947 did it open its doors to the general public. By that time, it had along with, Rajkumar College, Raipur, Aitchison College in Lahore and Mayo College in Ajmer acquired reputation as the top school in the Indian plains. The governor of the state of Uttar Pradesh is the patron of the college. Education The school is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination, New Delhi in 1980 and recognise by UP board in 1948. Day scholars as well as boarders study at Colvin which has no religious affiliations. The school has a library and an online media-access lab. The school has become co-educational up to class V . The college has produced 100% pass in ICSE, and ISC both in the session 2015 which is a record since the opening of ISC in the school in 1983. Earlier session's result in ISC was 100% with fresh pass out in I.I.T Dhanbad.

The community of Bamberton was first developed in 1912 when the Associated Cement Company plant was built. Bamberton was owned by the cement company and occupied by the plant, its employees and their families until the plant closed in 1980. Since the plant closed, ownership of Bamberton has changed hands multiple times and several development plans have been proposed. In 2015 the Malahat First Nation purchased Bamberton and announced a partnership with Steelhead LNG. With them, they have proposed the creation of a Liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Bamberton site.  History = Before the Founding of Bamberton  Aboriginal people began to inhabit Vancouver Island around 2000 BCE. The Malahat, Tseycum, Tsartlip, Tsawout, and Pauquachin came to reside along the Saanich Inlet. The land of the Saanich Inlet is a central part of the culture of First Nations people for both spiritual practice and economic subsistence. From the late 1700s to the mid 1800s, devastating First Nations' population declines occurred throughout B.C. due to disease outbreak and armed conflict as a result of the arrival of European settlers. In 1852, the Saanich First Nations' communities signed the Douglas Treaties selling their land to the Colony of Vancouver Island. In 1913, the McKenna-McBride Commission established the location of present-day reserves, including Tsawout Village at Saanichton Bay, Tseycum Village at Patricia Bay, Pauquachin Village at Coles Bay, Tsartlip Village at Brentwood Bay, Malahat First Nation south of Mill Bay, the Cowichan Lake First Nations, and the Cowichan tribes near Duncan. Although the Douglas Treaties stipulated that the First Nations people would be able to continue land based ceremonial and subsistence practices, the creation of Indian Reserves led to the encroachment of non-Natives within traditional resource harvesting locations and ongoing projects of civilization that led to land degradation. Although Bamberton was, and continues to be, privately owned, neighbouring First Nations groups view the land and resources as part of their traditional territory predating ownership. They have always believed that they have claim to the land and a say in its use, and continue to fight for this right under Malahat ownership.  Cement: 1912-1980  Bamberton is named for H.K.G. Bamber, a cement manufacturer from Gravesend, England, who was original owner of the land upon which Bamberton is located and was the managing director of British Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd..[1] The cement works had their origin across the Saanich Inlet at Tod Inlet in 1904 when the Vancouver Portland Cement Company established operations on the site now occupied by the Butchart Gardens. The demand for cement in the building boom outstripped the capacity of the Tod Inlet operation and led the company to construct a further plant at Bamberton, which opened in 1912 under the name Associated Cement Company. Both companies were operated by B.C. Cement Company Ltd. of Victoria. The outbreak of World War I ended the real estate boom leaving both plants idle for seven years. The plant at Bamberton resumed operations in 1921. By 1927 the Bamberton plant was producing 3,000 barrels per day and used 40,000 tons of Vancouver Island coal each year. It was an isolated, self-contained community owned by the company that operated the mill. At its peak, it employed 180 men all of whom resided on company property. The community was well equipped and included a recreation hall with a dance floor as large as that of The Empress (hotel). Over the last 20 years of operations production declined, costs increased and a protracted strike occurred. Operations came to an end 1980. In October 1982 the owner, then Genstar Cement Company, put the property up for sale.[2]  Recent Ownership and Development = Residential Development Proposals: 1982-2015  Several mixed residential and commercial developments have been proposed for Bamberton. Throughout the late 80's and the 90's The Trust for Sustainable Development proposed a 20 year plan that would see 12,000 future residents. The project met criticism regarding environmental impact on the Saanich Inlet. Its large size raised concerns over traffic and water supply. Ultimately funders decided not to go ahead with the project. Bamberton Properties LLP, an offshoot of Three Point Properties, bought the land in 2005. Bamberton properties spent up to $35 million in clean up costs and spent five years working with the Cowichan Valley Regional District (CVRD) to create a plan that would be approved. The CVRD determined there was no need for additional residential zoned property in the Mill Bay area, and subsequently Bamberton Properties was sold to the Malahat First Nation.  Malahat Ownership & Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) Proposal  On July 17, 2015, Malahat First Nation announced that they had purchased the Bamberton site, an acquisition that more than tripled the size of their territory. Chief Micheal Harry stated that this acquisition is a \\"tremendous opportunity\\" for the Malahat and \\"beyond exciting for the community\\". Chief Harry also stated that he hopes the land will bring long term employment opportunities for band members. Just over a month later, Steelhead LNG Corp. and Malahat First Nation announced the completion of a Mutual Benefits Agreement supporting the proposed development of Malahat LNG, a LNG facility to be located at the Bamberton site. If built, the floating facility will process up to 6 million tonnes per annum. Steelhead anticipates that this project will bring about significant economic benefits, including 30 years of revenue generation for local, provincial and federal governments and the creation of 200 permanent jobs at the facility. In addition, they predict that the project will create hundreds of direct and indirect jobs on Vancouver Island in a wide variety of sectors including design, construction and operations. They also note that training and employment opportunities will be available for both the Malahat First Nations and neighboring First Nations communities. Approximate route of the proposed pipeline. On September 1, 2015, Steelhead announced that they had partnered with U.S. pipeline developer Williams in order to construct a pipeline to the facility. The 128 km. long proposed pipeline would interconnect with Spectra Energy B.Cs pipeline system at Sumas, Washington and travel over-land in Washington state to Cherry Point Refinery, located 11 km Southwest of Blaine in Whatcom County. From there, the pipeline would be constructed underwater until it reaches the facility at Bamberton. In October 2015, the project received regulatory approval by the National Energy Board. Steelhead CEO Nigel Kuzemko stated: \\"We welcome this decision by the National Energy Board, which represents a significant milestone for our company and our projects\\" and \\"While these developments and the regulatory approval by the NEB are being well received in the global LNG marketplace, we recognize that we are still at the beginning of a long process that will see us engage and work closely with First Nations, government, communities, residents and regulators to secure the environmental and regulatory approvals we need for our projects to continue to move forward.\\" The project has generated considerable controversy from other Saanich First nations groups. The chiefs of the Tsarlip, Tsawout, Tseycum and Pauquachin have made it clear that they are united in opposition to the project. \\"We wanted to make a strong impact statement to make sure our statement is heard ... we are making it well known that we oppose LNG in our territory,\\" said Chief Rebecca David of the Pauquachin First Nation. \\"The decisions and choices we make today affect the next seven generations. We are trying to protect the water and the lands of our future children.\\" Chief Don Tom of the Tsarlip First Nation was quoted as saying that the pipeline and shipping through the inlet threaten both the environment and their way of life, as the inlet is an important source of food, recreation and spiritual connectivity to their ancestors. The site shares its name with the nearby Bamberton Provincial Park.

Jordan River, founded as and still officially gazetted as River Jordan, is a small settlement on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, located approximately west of Victoria. Established as a logging camp in the late 19th century, Jordan River has Vancouver Island's second hydroelectric power plant. It is popular amongst winter surfers. The eastern terminus of the Juan de Fuca Trail is at China Beach, west of Jordan River. History In 1790, the Spanish navigator and explorer Lieutenant Francisco de Eliza rebuilt a Spanish fort at Nootka Sound and subsequently explored the area between Nootka Sound and present day Victoria, BC. Originally named Rio Hermoso by his Sub-Lieutenant Manuel Quimper on June 14, 1790, the name was changed later that year to Rio Jordan when the Carta Reducida was made by Gonzalo López de Haro. The name change from Rio Hermoso to Rio Jordan is attributed to Francisco de Eliza's chaplain, Alejandro Jordan. Subsequent charting by British explorers anglicized the name to Jordan River. Logging of the Jordan River watershed dates back to the 1880s. Timber harvesting intensified in 1907 with the construction of 6 km (4 mi) of railway tracks. Western Forest Products took over the tree farming operation in 1934 and still manages the area forests today. The railroad has been long abandoned and replaced by log hauling trucks. Development of the Jordan River watershed and construction of the hydroelectric plant began in 1911 and finished a few years later. During the construction of the hydroelectric plant Jordan River was home to 1000 workers. Until 1912 Jordan River was only accessible by sea. That year the Old Otter Point Road was extended to River Jordan, connecting the town by land to Sooke and Victoria. During World War II Jordan River became strategically important to the Royal Canadian Air Force, housing the X-1 Detachment's Low-Flying Early Warning Radar System, called 'Microwave Early Warning/Ground Control Intercept', in anticipation of a Japanese attack on the west coast. Jordan River has a commanding and unobstructed view of the Strait of Juan De Fuca, from Cape Flattery to Port Angeles and thus was ideal for the deployment of the early warning radar system. This same geographical ocean location also makes the town a surfing destination today. The Old Otter Point Road became part of the newly created Highway 14 in 1953, extending west from Colwood, a suburb of Victoria, to Jordan River. By 1975 Highway 14 was extended all the way west to the remote community of Port Renfrew and paving was completed in the late 1980s. Industry=Hydroelectric dam and power plant Jordan River is the location of Vancouver Island's second hydroelectric generating station. The Vancouver Island Power Company completed construction of the Jordan River hydroelectric system in 1911. Water collects at Diversion Dam, runs 8.8 km (5.5 mi) down a wooden sluice to an equalizing basin and flows through a steel penstock for the last 330 vertical meters (1083 vertical feet). From 1912 to 1930 continual improvements and additional generators pushed the capacity of the power plant to 26 megawatts. In 1971 the flume was replaced by a tunnel, connected to a penstock flowing down to a new power house, presently located across the river from the original location. A Japanese built generator replaced the old equipment, boosting power output from 26 megawatts to 175 megawatts. Tree farming Most of the land around Jordan River is managed under a tree farm licence (TFL). Western Forest Products has been in charge of the tree farm licence since 1934, encompassing 32,490 hectares (81,200 acres) between Sooke and Port Renfrew. At the centre of Jordan River, between the bridge and the hydroelectric power house is the raw log sorting facility. Logs are sorted and arranged into rafts at the river's mouth, then towed via sea to Vancouver and Washington State facilities. The majority of tree farm land has been logged twice in the last 100 years and is currently growing its second generation of replanted trees. Western Forest Products has installed signs along Hwy 14 indicating the growth phases of the forests, such as when a particular tract of land has been logged, replanted, and thinned. Surfing Historically a logging camp, River Jordan has become a surfing destination thanks to long wrapping rights known as The Point, Sewers, and Rock Piles, but it has also developed a reputation for intolerant, aggressive locals. Despite being somewhat inconsistent, these waves crank when it's on. https://magicseaweed.com/Vancouver-Island-South-Jordan-River-Surf-Guide/323/ Geography Nearby communities * Port Renfrew * Sooke * Victoria Nearby Rivers * River Jordan * Loss Creek * Sombrio River See also *China Beach (Canada) *Sombrio Beach *Jordan River (Jordan) ReferencesExternal links * Surf Forecast * Category:Juan de Fuca region Category:Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia Category:Populated places in the Capital Regional District Category:Surfing locations in Canada ","title":"Jordan River, British Columbia"},{"id":"4430600","text":"Emma Laura Snowsill OAM (born 15 June 1981) is an Australian professional triathlete and multiple gold medalist in the World Championships and the Commonwealth Games.

Harish and Kona Venkat went to Mumbai to listen to the story. RGV gave the narration and Harish told RGV that the script is very good, but won't suit Ravi teja. RGV told him – 'you came from Hyderabad after assisting a couple of films and passing judgment on my story like a pundit. But I like your guts because you spoke frankly without trying to be a sycophant. Since you worked with Ravi Teja and know what works for him, I am willing to offer you a direction chance'.

Whilst the poet Tulsidas wrote about Ram - the son of King Dashratha; the poet Kabir wrote about Ram as non-form God. Rama's name is often chanted or sung within the many traditions of Hinduism. A popular mantra is Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram (often prefixed with \\"Om\\"), which was popularized in western India by Samarth Ramdas. In Mahabharata, Shiva states that uttering \\"Rama\\" three times is equal to pronouncing the thousand other names of God. Ram Naam in Guru Granth Sahib, sacred book and current guru of Sikhism is second most commonly used name for formless god after the name Hari. \\"Ram Naam Satya Hai\\" (The name of Ram is the truth) is commonly chanted by Hindus while carrying a dead body to be cremated. This recitation implies that the dead body no longer sustains the truth (breath) which is Ram Naam. Individuals Connected To The Mantra The mantra was often used by Mahatma Gandhi. Neem Karoli Baba encouraged the constant repetition of \\"Ram\\" in order to become closer to God, saying: \\"By taking the name of Ram, everything is accomplished.\\" Tyagaraja, a composer of carnatic music, regarded music as a way to experience the love of God. His songs were on Ram Naam. Swami Ramdas is said to have attained Nirvana through constant repetition of \\"Om Sri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram\\". He established Anandashram, where this mantra is sung continuously from morning to night. Aniruddha’s Universal Bank of Ram Naam “Aniruddha’s Universal Bank of Ram Naam” (Head Office situated in Mumbai, India) is a unique bank which accepts “Ram” name instead of currency as deposits. The bank account holders write “Ram” in a specially designed book with image of Lord Hanumanji on each page with ultimate aim of bringing peace, inner bliss and strengthen destiny of the account holders to withstand obstacles in life. Shravan Bhakti (devotion in the form of listening) is one of the highest forms of bhakti (devotion) which can be achieved by writing “Ram”. While writing “Ram” name, the eyes read the name, the hand writes the name and the mind automatically recites the mantra leading to internal listening. Hence ram naam book is considered as the easiest tool of devotion.

The tombs, which are built above ground in tower-like structures called chullpas, are the vestiges of the Qulla people, who are Aymara conquered by the Inca Empire in the 15th century. The structures housed the remains of complete family groups, although they were probably limited to nobility. Many of the tombs have been dynamited by grave robbers, while others were left unfinished. Chullpa Veneration of the dead and kinship were integral parts of Aymara culture, and the huge chullpas or \\"chupa\\" at Sillustani were built to house the Aymara elite of the immediate pre-Inca and Inca period. The word was used in the 19th century and comes from the Dictionary of Ludovico Bertonio (1612). Bertonio referred to the basket burials of the semi-nomadic pastoralists as \\"chulpas\\" and actually referred to stone towers as uta amaya \\"houses of the soul\\". However, the term \\"chullpa\\" remains used today for the towers. Many of the chullpas at Sillustani show pre-Inca characteristics that were later redressed with Inca stone blocks. Similar chullpas are found throughout the entire south Central Andes with the above ground burial styles going back at least to the mature Tiwanaku period (ca 500-950). The insides of the tombs were built to hold entire groups of people, most likely extended families of the Aymara elite. Corpses were not intentionally mummified, but in the dry environment created by the closed tomb, they survived for centuries. Most mummy bundles indicate burial in a fetal position. Some of the tombs also have various animal shapes carved into the stone. The only openings to the buildings face east, where it was believed the Sun was reborn by Mother Earth each day.

In contrast with the Inca, who used stones of varying shapes, the Colla used even rectangular edges. While chullpas are not unique to Sillustani and are found across the Altiplano, this site is considered the best and most preserved example of them.

(HTML abstract) It is found in lowland forest canopy and semi-open woodland, and builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs high in a tree or amongst vines. It lays one white egg. The short-billed pigeon is long and weighs . It is unpatterned and mainly wine-purple in colour, becoming browner on the belly and more olive-brown on the back. The tail and primary flight feathers are blackish, the bill is black, and the legs and eyes are purple-red. The female is slightly duller and browner than the male, and the juvenile bird has a greyish brown head, neck and breast, with cinnamon scaling on the head and upperparts. The short-billed pigeon has a complex, loud and high-pitched call '; this is usually uttered singly or at least with considerable pauses between calls. It is normally sighted in pairs as it forages in the tree tops for mistletoe, fruits and berries, but may also be seen on tracks and roadsides seeking grit or small invertebrates. In southern Central America, this species is replaced at higher altitudes by its close relative, the very similar ruddy pigeon, Patagioenas subvinacea. They can be distinguished by the slower, more complex \\"song\\" of the short-billed pigeon. References * Stiles, F. Gary & Skutch, Alexander Frank (1989): A guide to the birds of Costa Rica.

It was established in Narayanganj in 1950 by the Adamjee Group. It was the first jute mill in East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh). Gradually, the mill became the largest jute mill in the world, exceeding the jute mills of Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, and Dundee, Scotland. The mills were nationalised after the independence of Bangladesh in 1972. It was operated by the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation before being closed down in 2002. History Abdul Wahid Adamjee Adamjee Jute Mills was set up by Abdul Wahid Adamjee, Pakistan's foremost industrialist, and scion of the wealthiest family in the country. Initially, the said project was a partnership between the Adamjees and the PICIC (the government's industrial arm). The Adamjee family, however, soon took control of the project, and eventually built it into the largest jute mill in the world. In 1947 when India was partitioned there were 108 jute mills in Bengal but all were located in West Bengal which went to India. After the Independence of Pakistan, Muslim entrepreneurs were asked by the government of Pakistan to create proposals for a jute mill in East Bengal. The Adamjee Group in December 1949 presented the government of Pakistan a proposal for the jute plant. The capital for the mills were to be provided by Adamjee Brothers and the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation 50-50 equally. Siddhirganj was chosen as the site of mill due to the good river, road, and rail communication facilities. The mill was established in December 1951. The Adamjee family lost control of the mill in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War and it was nationalized after the Independence of Bangladesh. During the war Bengali workers were replaced by Bihari workers in the. After the war ended, the Bihari workers in the factory were protected by the Indian Army. It employed over 25,000 workers when it was closed on 30 June 2002. Since the nationalization the mill had accumulated 12 billion taka in losses. Present Machinery inside Admajee Jute Mills After a strong battle for survival, Adamjee Jute Mills was officially closed down in 2002 despite huge protests from local policy makers and political opponents. In that place, a new industrial zone has been installed, Adamjee Export Processing Zone. In August 2011, the jute and textiles ministry sent a proposal to the prime minister of Bangladesh seeking her approval for rebuilding the second unit of the Adamjee Jute Mills in Narayanganj on 11 acres of land at an estimated cost of Tk 6087.2 million.

Musical genres used by the band include drum and bass, deep house, trip hop, downtempo, and breakbeat. The name \\"Etro Anime\\" means \\"to be infinite in spirit.\\" The band currently consists of Anais Alonso, Ted Birkey, Harold Davis Jr., Thom Bell, and Gregg Jarvis. Previous members include David Fisher, Tom Welsch, Shambo Pfaff, and Liset Alea, who recorded a solo album for EMI titled No Sleep after leaving Etro Anime in 2005. As of 2006, Fisher and Birkey have been producing tracks for Etro Anime's next release featuring vocalist Alonso. Etro Anime's single \\"Danger\\" was used as the introductory music for the US version of the video game Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga. History Etro Anime cultivated a loyal fan base by translating their studio work into well-executed performances where samples intertwined with live drums, bass, keyboards, sax and trumpet, supported former lead singer Liset Alea on stage. While playing clubs such as Izzy Bar and Mercury Lounge, the lineup included programmer/sax/trumpeter David Fisher, programmer/keyboardist Ted Birkey, bassist Tom Welsch, bassist Charles Becker and drummer Shambo Pfaff. The band also included guitarist Kerry Trainor, who wrote and recorded with Etro through their first record. They were one electronic group that prioritized their live sound first before actually tackling the recording studio. In 2002, they released their first self-produced full-length LP on Entry 1 Records distributed by V2 in Benelux to critical acclaim. From the buzz, the band landed their first ever-European Show at the 2002 Amsterdam Dance Event. Hot on the heels of their remarkable live debut in The Netherlands, Etro secured a support slot on Kosheen's sell out 2002 tour of Austria and Germany. The band made a swift return to the mainland European stage for an appearance at the 2-Day Frequency Festival in Salzburg, Austria. Etro Anime shared the Alternative Tent along with Kosheen, Sneaker Pimps, and Das Pop. They finished the year supporting the Frenchman, DJ Llorca and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records. Early in 2003, Liset, Ted, and Dave worked in Amsterdam with Dutch Dance phenom John Kanselaar and finished two singles to add to the album while developing new tracks for Etro's next release. Liset took advantage of the opportunity to tour with French DJ, Alex Kid later that summer and ultimately left the band to pursue her solo career. In early 2004, Neurodisc Records picked up \\"See the Sound\\" along with the Maxi-Single Summer Rain for the U.S. release. Capitalizing on the US dance market, the first single, \\"Summer Rain\\" climbed to no. 20 on the U.S. Dance charts in March 2004.

It belongs to a clade of small and rather plain species of Patagioenas with characteristic calls that constitute the subgenus Oenoenas.Mahler, Bettina & Tubaro, Pablo L. (2001): Relationship between song characters and morphology in New World pigeons. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 74(4): 533–539. Like the other New World pigeons, it was formerly united with their Old World relatives in Columba, but today the New World genus Patagioenas is recognized as distinct again.Johnson, Kevin P.; de Kort, Selvino; Dinwoodey, Karen, Mateman, A. C.; ten Cate, Carel; Lessells, C. M. & Clayton, Dale H. (2001): A molecular phylogeny of the dove genera Streptopelia and Columba. The Auk 118(4): 874–887. PDF fulltext The ruddy pigeon is 28 cm (11 in) long and weighs 170 g. It is unpatterned and mainly wine-purple in colour, becoming more rufous on the back. The tail and primary flight feathers are dark brown, the bill is black, and the legs are purple-red. The iris is typically red, but can, at least in the Amazon basin, sometimes be dull yellow (however, due to the red eye-ring, the iris never appears as conspicuously white as in adults of the sympatric subspecies of the plumbeous pigeon, P. plumbea). The female is slightly duller and browner than the male, and the juvenile bird has a greyish brown head, neck and breast, with cinnamon or rufous scaling on the head and upperparts. It has a loud and fairly high-pitched coo, ko'COO coo call, with considerable pauses between calls just as in its relatives. There are some geographical variations in its voice, with some populations singing four-noted songs, while others sing three-noted songs. In Central America, the ruddy pigeon is replaced at lower altitudes by its close relative, the very similar short-billed pigeon (P. nigrirostris). The two species are best separated by call, which is faster and less complex in P. subvinacea. left In Central America it is found in highland forest canopy and semi-open woodland from 1500 m (5000 ft) ASL to the timberline. In South America it occurs in the canopy of humid forest from near sea-level to 1500 m (5000 ft) ASL, occasionally higher; exceptionally, they may range up to 3000 m ASL or more.Krabbe, Niels; Flórez, Pablo; Suárez, Gustavo; Castaño, José; Arango, Juan David & Duque, Arley (2006) The birds of Páramo de Frontino, western Andes of Colombia. Ornitologıá Colombiana 4: 39–50 [English with Spanish abstract]. PDF fulltext It is not uncommon across its wide range but due to projected deforestation is thus classified as a Vulnerable species by the IUCN. It is normally seen in pairs as it forages in the tree tops for fruits and berries--being particularly fond of mistletoe fruit - but may occasionally be seen on tracks and roadside seeking grit. It builds a rudimentary platform nest out of twigs 5 m high in a small tree, and lays one white egg. References * Stiles, F. Gary & Skutch, Alexander Frank (1989): A guide to the birds of Costa Rica.

Port Renfrew has a population of 144 (as of the 2016 Census) and has been touted as \\"the Tall Tree Capital of Canada\\". Monday, August 17, 2020 History Port Renfrew has been the home of the First Nations of Canada since time immemorial. The Pacheedaht First Nation, meaning \\"People of the Sea Foam\\", have traditional village sites in and around the main town centre. Originally named Port San Juan, the original settlers changed the name to honour Lord Renfrew who planned to settle crofters there. The name change was due to mail being sent to the San Juan Islands instead of Port San Juan. However, the inlet the town sits beside retains the name Port San Juan. Like many coastal Vancouver Island communities, Port Renfrew has a rich history of forestry and fishing. Between 1830 and 1925, 137 major shipping tragedies occurred in the immediate vicinity of the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This stretch of coastline around Port Renfrew became known as the Graveyard of the Pacific. Geography Located at the head of the Port San Juan inlet, Port Renfrew lies adjacent to this natural harbour as well as the San Juan River. The other end of the inlet is located on the Juan de Fuca Strait near its confluence with the Pacific Ocean. The San Juan Valley lies northeast of the town, surrounded by mountains on all sides. Port Renfrew can be accessed from Victoria via British Columbia Highway 14 or from Lake Cowichan via Pacific Marine Road. Climate The climate is classic oceanic (Köppen: Cfb), because it is close to the Strait of Juan de Fuca towards the interior, the Mediterranean trend of rainfall patterns begins to be evidenced with high annual rainfall (proximity to the Csb), in terms of temperature is similar the Channel Islands. Summers are warm and almost fresh and winters are mild, one of the mildest in all of Canada. Attractions Avatar Grove Port Renfrew sits at the head of Port San Juan and the mouth of the San Juan River, affording it a variety of recreational activities such as fishing, kayaking, and birding. The surrounding mountains and coastline are home to a variety of hiking trails, most notably the West Coast Trail to the north and Juan de Fuca Trail to the southwest. The San Juan Valley to the east is home to numerous old growth forests and many of Canada's largest and oldest trees.

It has some common elements with, but is a complete independent development from the English Morris dance. As with most Tongan dances, the whole performance is to dazzle the spectators and to please the chiefs. There is no hidden purpose. History The original \\"eke\\" comes from Futuna. It was composed by the Futunans as a kind of penitence for the murder of the Marist father Pierre Chanel in 1841.. With the introduction of Catholicism in Tonga, they brought the eke with them, first to Tafahi, then to Niuafoou. After the volcanic eruption of their island in 1946 the people of Niuafoou were resettled on Eua. From there the eke, by then named sōkē came to Tongatapu, to the Catholic diocese of Maufanga to be more exact, which brought it into Tonga's mainstream. Performance A single vaka (boat) consists of 2 men and 2 women facing each other. Each of the men have one long stick, about 2 meter, the both women carry short sticks, about 40 cm, one in each hand. Occasionally this assignment is exchanged. On the beat of the music they hit the sticks against each other in a repeating pattern. In the first movement, for example, the woman to the left (or right) hits with her right stick the top of the stick of the man to the right (or left), then her left stick against his on the bottom, and then her right on his top again, while on the fourth beat they turn around to prepare for the next movement. But many variants are possible. The last hit can be done with her left stick again, while he quickly turns over his whole stick. Or the second hit can be in the middle on the long stick, which the man keeps up as a shield In the second movement the exchange is diagonally: the men hit the tops of their sticks together, then the bottoms, then the tops again, while the women in the space left over hit their sticks together. Or perhaps the men hit only twice, giving the women more space to elegantly hit their sticks in the middle on the second beat. Again beat 4 is the transition to the next movement. The third movement may be as the first one, but now the exchange is between the persons in the front and in the back. In the fourth movement, if used, the women can turn to the public to make a little bow, or to hit their own sticks together, while the men can bump their sticks with a bang on the ground. These movements repeat as long as the song continues. Various series of movements may be applied to different stanzas, but they fall in either of two groups: *Eke nou (short eke), where the groups of 4, the separate 'boats' interact with themselves only. In a big performance there are many 'boats' on a row, all performing independently. *Eke loa (long eke), when the 'boats' exchange performers, the front row for example going to the left and the back row to the right. Lyrics There are a few songs which will be recited at a sōkē, usually when the performers are still standing still. When the refrain is sung they hit their sticks as long as the refrain is repeated, and when finished they stand still again for the rest of the song. There are a few refrains like 'hina hea' and 'sōkē'. In fact the original name of the dance is rather eke and not sōkē. But nowadays in Tonga it is better known by this refrain. However, on Wallis and Futuna it is still known by its original name. Part from the Uvean (Wallis island) eke, which was already known before 1932 and was performed by the Uvean community in Suva at the South pacific festival of 1972: Pongipongi tuu te nuanua i sakē moo teketi mai te fanālua i sakē e ōmai ai nai mātua i sakē o fehuki pē ko fea ia Lavelua i sakē pea tala age leva naua i sakē e afio i Hahake Lavelua i sakē which translates as: In the morning there is a rainbow hurray - and a twomaster appears hurray - bringing these both gentlemen hurray - who ask where Lavelua is hurray - whereupon they two are told hurray - king Lavelua reigns in Hahake [the eastern district of Uvea, where the capital Matāutu is located] hurray. The two gentlemen named seem to be Pierre Chanel and Marie Nizier, who were sent to Futuna by father Pierre Bataillon (see below). Part from the Maufanga (Tonga) sōkē: Sōkē! he siale toli nofo au ta tuia sōkē lupe fau fālelé matangi angi pea moé atu ē! langa mai fohé isakē, isakē, isakē, isakē io! Siale-toli-nofo means gardenia-picked-while-sitting-down most likely a contribution from Tafahi, where on the road to the top of the mountain Piu- o-Tafahi there grows a gardenia with its branches so low over the path that you can pick the flowers with no effort. The place is called Pua-toli-nofo (flower picked sitting down). Most of the words of the song are quite unintelligeable in modern Tongan, but some words (seafaring terms, like matangi angi pea moe, the wind blows and then sleeps) and names (like Lavelua and Futuna) can be distinguished which give a clue to its origin. Also the Uvean and Futunan versions are in such old language that it is not clear which language it is. The two pieces above, however, are rather Uvean.

It is used to treat portal hypertension and its main complication (esophageal varices). It was developed by W. Dean Warren. Splenopancreatic and gastric disconnection (SPGD) DSRS is typically done with splenopancreatic and gastric disconnection (ligation of the gastric veins and pancreatic veins (that drain into the portal vein) and complete detachment of the splenic vein from the portal venous system), as it improves the outcome. Comparison to TIPS Survival with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) versus a DSRS is thought to be approximately similar, but still an area of intensive research. Both TIPS and DSRS lead to decreased rates of variceal bleeding at the expense of hepatic encephalopathy; however, TIPS appears to have more shunt dysfunction and lead to more encephalopathy and bleeds.

Fictional character biography The Man-Beast was once an ordinary red wolf that is captured and mutated on Mount Wundagore by the High Evolutionary - a being intent on creating an army of New Men from animals. While the wolf was mutated by \\"Isotope C\\" and the Evolutionary's genetic accelerator, the High Evolutionary is attacked by the Thunder God Thor, who was attempting to find his mortal love, Jane Foster who had been taken to teach other New-Men. The delay is costly, as the wolf is overexposed to the isotope and pushed to physical and mental perfection. The process also instills the creature with an utter hatred of all other forms of life. The High Evolutionary called his creation a \\"Super-Beast\\" - which promptly escapes and uses the High Evolutionary's genetic accelerator equipment to create an army of followers though none were as evolved as him. The Evolutionary lures him out with a sonic device, and the Super-Beast comes with the High Evolutionary's army, that attack its creator's own New Men while the Super-Beast attacks Thor and the High Evolutionary. The Super-Beast is defeated by Thor as he attacks the High Evolutionary, with the High Evolutionary then placing the unconscious Super-Beast and his defeated army of New Men in a rocket. The rocket is then launched into deep space, in the hope that the Super-Beast would never be seen again. The High Evolutionary then travels into space as well with all of his creatures and his Wundagore citadel.Thor vol. 1, #134 - 135 The creature, now calling itself the Man- Beast, lands with its army on Counter-Earth - a planet located on the other side of the Sun and also created by the High Evolutionary. The Man-Beast, seeking to become a conqueror, poses as Counter-Earth's United States President Rex Carpenter. He and his army begin to corrupt Counter-Earth by introducing evil, attempting to destroy Counter-Earth.

Tilottama therefore means the being whose smallest particle is the finest or one who is composed of the finest and highest qualities. In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Tilottama is described to have been created by the divine architect Vishwakarma, at Brahma's request, by taking the best quality of everything as the ingredients. She was responsible for bringing about the mutual destruction of the Asuras (demons), Sunda and Upasunda. Even gods like Indra are described to be enamoured of Tilottama. While a legend talks about a pre-birth as an ugly widow, another narrates how she was cursed to be born as a Daitya (demon) princess Usha by sage Durvasa. Birth and destruction of Sunda and Upasunda In the Adi Parva (Book 1) of the epic Mahabharata, the divine sage Narada tells the Pandava brothers the story of destruction of demon brothers Sunda and Upsunda due to the apsara Tilottama, and warns the Pandavas that their common wife Draupadi could be a reason of quarrel between them. The tale states Sunda and Upasunda were sons of the asura (demon) Nikumbha. They are described as inseparable siblings who shared everything: the kingdom, the bed, food, house, seat. Once, the brothers practiced severe austerities on the Vindhya mountains, compelling the creator-god Brahma to grant them a boon. They asked for great power and immortality, but the latter was denied, instead Brahma gave them the boon that nothing but they themselves can hurt each other. Soon, the demons attacked heaven and drove the gods out. Conquering the whole universe, the demons started harassing sages and creating havoc in the universe. The demons Sunda and Upasunda disputing the apsara Tilottama The gods and seers sought refuge with Brahma. Brahma then ordered the divine architect Vishvakarma to create a beautiful woman. Vishvakarma collected all that was beautiful from the three worlds (heaven, earth, underworld) and all the gems of the world and created an alluring woman - with unrivaled beauty - from them. As she was created bit by bit from the gems, Brahma named her Tilottama and directed her to seduce the demon brothers to the extent that she would become an issue of contention between them. As Sunda and Upasunda were enjoying dalliance with women and engrossed in drinking liquor along a river bank in the Vindhya mountains, Tilottama appeared there plucking flowers. Bewitched by her voluptuous figure and drunk with power and liquor, Sunda and Upasunda took hold of Tilottama right and left hands respectively. As both of the brothers argued that Tilottama should be his own wife, they grabbed their clubs and attacked each other, ultimately killing each other. The gods congratulated her and Brahma granted her the right to roam freely in the universe as a boon. Brahma also decreed that no one would be able to look at her for a long time due to her luster.Buitenen, Johannes Adrianus Bernardus (1978). The Mahābhārata. vol 1 University of Chicago Press Adi Parva (Book of Beginnings) Cantos 201-204. pp. 392-8 Enchantress of the gods The Mahabharata (Book 1: Adi Parva) narrates: Though Brahma was unaffected by Tilottama's beauty, the other gods were spell-bound by her beauty. Initially, Shiva and Indra remain unperturbed,The Iconography and Ritual of Siva at Elephanta, by Charles Dillard Collins, at pg. 86 at https://books.google.com/books?id=pQNi6kAGJQ4C&pg;=PA86&dq;=shiva+Tilottama&cd;=5#v=onepage&q;&f;=false however, so great was the desire of the great god Shiva (referred to as \\"Sthanu\\" - the firm one) to see her, a head developed on both his sides and back of his head as she circumambulated him as a mark of reverence. The god- king of heaven, Indra, however, developed thousand red eyes on his body to see her. The Mahabharata Book 1: Adi Parva SECTION CCXIII by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, tr.(1883-1896) Another legend describes sage Gautama cursing Indra for seducing his wife Ahalya. Gautama decreed that Indra would develop thousand vaginas on his body, but they change to thousand eyes once Indra lays his eyes on Tiliottama. Another tale in the Mahabharata (Book 13) narrates that Tilottama comes to tempt Shiva. Eager to see her as she circumambulated him, Shiva developed four visible faces, another interpretation states that Shiva revealed himself to Tilottama as the five Brahmans, with his five faces (4 visible, 1 invisible). The east face signifying his sovereignty over the world, the north face to sport with Parvati, the west to ensure the happiness of creatures; the south face, to destroy the universe and the fifth face was invisible as it was beyond the comprehension of Tilottama.Of The Saivism, Volume 1 By Swami P. Anand, Swami Parmeshwaranand p. 116The Mahabharata Book 13: Anusasana Parva SECTION CXLI by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, tr.(1883-1896) Another legend from the Puranas says Brahma created Tilottama and was aroused by her. Brahma lusts for his own daughter Tilottama and makes five heads in order to see her. Then Brahma sends Tilottama to Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva, to pay her obeisance to him. Shiva glances at her, but avoids to carefully look at her as his consort Parvati was seated beside him. As Tilottama circumambulated Shiva, he develops a head in each direction to see her. The divine sage Narada taunts Parvati, \\"You can imagine what Shiva is thinking about this woman who is reviled by wise men\\". Agitated, Parvati covers Shiva's eyes with her hands submerging the universe in darkness. Shiva then develops a third eye to bring light to the universe. Curse to king Sahasranika The Kathasaritsagara, the 11th century Sanskrit translation of the 1st-2nd century Paishachi text Brihatkatha, tells how king Sahasranika was cursed by Tilottama. As the king was returning from Indraloka to his kingdom, Tiliottama told him to wait so she could tell an interesting fact, but the king engrossed in the thoughts of his sweetheart - the apsara Alambusa, ignored what Tilottama said. Infuriated by the king's conduct, Tilottama cursed the king that he would suffer separation from the one he was thinking about - for a period of fourteen years. Previous birth and rebirth Aniruddha with Usha, the rebirth of Tilottama The Padma Purana narrates that Tilottama was an ugly widow named Kubja in her previous birth. Kubja underwent auspicious ceremonies for eight years and finally performing the ritual Magha puja. This ensured that she was born as Tiliottama and appeared heaven as an apsara. The Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates that Sahasika, grandson of Bali disturbed sage Durvasa's penance in his amours with Tilottama. As the result, the sage turned him into donkey and cursed Tilottama, to be born as demon Banasura's daughter Usha. Usha would later become the wife of Aniruddha, the grandson of Krishna. In popular culture Her tale was made into a movie in 1954, by Homi Wadia, Directed by Babubhai Mistry, starring Chitra, Kailash, Maruti, B. M. Vyas, Babu Raje and Indira Bansal.

It is also called the portal venous system (although it is not the only example of a portal venous system) and splanchnic veins, which is not synonymous with hepatic portal system and is imprecise (as it means visceral veins and not necessarily the veins of the abdominal viscera).Splanchnic circulation. Online Medical Dictionary. URL: http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?splanchnic+circulation. Accessed on: October 22, 2008.  Structure  Large veins that are considered part of the portal venous system are the: *Hepatic portal vein *Splenic vein *Superior mesenteric vein *Inferior mesenteric vein The superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein come together to form the actual hepatic portal vein. The inferior mesenteric vein connects in the majority of people on the splenic vein, but in some people, it is known to connect on the portal vein or the superior mesenteric vein. Roughly, the portal venous system corresponds to areas supplied by the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery, and the inferior mesenteric artery. Function Microscopic section through a small portal vein branch inside the liver (×250 magnified) The portal venous system is responsible for directing blood from parts of the gastrointestinal tract to the liver. Substances absorbed in the small intestine travel first to the liver for processing before continuing to the heart. Not all of the gastrointestinal tract is part of this system. The system extends from about the lower portion of the esophagus to the upper part of the anal canal. It also includes venous drainage from the spleen and pancreas. Blood flow to the liver is unique in that it receives both oxygenated and (partially) deoxygenated blood. As a result, the partial gas pressure of oxygen (pO2) and perfusion pressure of portal blood are lower than in other organs of the body. Blood passes from branches of the portal vein through cavities between \\"plates\\" of hepatocytes called sinusoids. Blood also flows from branches of the hepatic artery and mixes in the sinusoids to supply the hepatocytes with oxygen. This mixture percolates through the sinusoids and collects in a central vein which drains into the hepatic vein. The hepatic vein subsequently drains into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic artery provides 30 to 40% of the oxygen to the liver, while only accounting for 25% of the total liver blood flow. The rest comes from the partially deoxygenated blood from the portal vein. The liver consumes about 20% of the total body oxygen when at rest. That is why the total liver blood flow is quite high, at about 1 litre a minute and up to two litres a minute. That is on average one fourth of the average cardiac output at rest. Clinical significance Portal hypertension is a condition in which the blood pressure of the portal venous system is too high. It is often the result of cirrhosis of the liver. Drug metabolism Many drugs that are absorbed through the GI tract are substantially metabolized by the liver before reaching general circulation. This is known as the first pass effect. As a consequence, certain drugs can only be taken via certain routes. For example, nitroglycerin cannot be swallowed because the liver would deactivate the medication, but it can be taken under the tongue or transdermally (through the skin) and thus is absorbed in a way that bypasses the portal venous system. Inversely, dextromethorphan, a cough suppressor, is best taken orally because it needs to be metabolised by the liver into dextrorphan in order to be effective. This latter principle is that of most prodrugs. The use of suppositories is a way to bypass partially the portal vein: the upper 1/3 of the rectum is drained into the portal vein while the lower 2/3 are drained into the internal iliac vein that goes directly in the inferior vena cava (thus bypassing the liver).

The trail stretches from China Beach, 35 km west of Sooke, to Botanical Beach, just outside Port Renfrew. Panoramic views of the coastline, Juan de Fuca Strait and the Olympic Mountains can be seen from many points along this rainforest trail. Lucky are those who spot a pod of whales, but it is not uncommon to view sea lions, bald eagles, herons and other wildlife. It is a stunning trail of moderate difficulty. The trail can be hiked in part, as a day hike, or backpacked in its entirety in four to six days. Unlike the longer West Coast Trail (), the Juan de Fuca Trail does not require a reservation; however, there is a backcountry camping fee of $10 per person/per night. It is also suggested to plan ahead if travelling with a large group. Some campsites are quite small and so arriving early to guarantee a spot is highly recommended.

Its main devotion (honzon) is Yakushi. Daigo, literally \\"ghee\\", is used figuratively to mean \\"crème de la crème\\" and is a metaphor of the most profound part of Buddhist thoughts.  History  Daigo-ji was founded in the early Heian period.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869, p. 115. In 874, Rigen-daishi (Shōbō) founded the temple.

He was buried in the temple, which is why his posthumous name was Daigo.Titsingh, p. 134.  National treasures  Kondō (Golden Hall) of Daigo-ji, a National Treasure of Japan Several structures, including the kondō and the five-story pagoda, are National Treasures of Japan. The temple possesses 18 specifically designated national treasures, including the buildings and other works as well; and the temple holds several dozen important cultural assets.

Autumn color from Acer palmatum (momiji) at Daigo-ji  Layout  The entrance of Sambō-in Daigo-ji is laid out in three parts: Sambō-in, Shimo-Daigo (Lower Daigo), and Kami-Daigo (Upper Daigo).Guide to Daigoji Complex These are progressively older, wilder, and further up the mountain. Sambō-in and Shimo-Daigo are at the base of the mountain, easily accessible, and attract the most tourism; Kami-Daigo is on top of the mountain, requires a long, strenuous hike to reach, and is accordingly less visited. The streets around Sambō-in can be freely traveled, but entering Sambō-in proper, the museum, Shimo-Daigo, or Kami-Daigo all require separate admission – the first three have combined ticketing, while Kami-Daigo is separate. Sambō-in is a collection of walled complexes, connected by streets lined with cherry blossoms. It contains the temple proper (including a noted tea garden), a museum, and other complexes, and is very lively during cherry blossom season. Shimo-Daigo is one large enclosure, containing detached halls, including the oldest surviving building in Kyoto, together with open spaces. Kami-Daigo, other than a small cluster of buildings at the base, is located on top of the mountain. The entrance to Kami-Daigo can be reached by passing through Shimo-Daigo, or by a path beside Shimo-Daigo. There is a path with stairs up to the top, which takes about one hour to reach the main complex; halfway up there is a resting point and small shrine. At the entrance to the main complex is Daigo-Sui, a spring of holy water, which was the origin of Daigo-ji, together with other buildings. A further fifteen-minute walk reaches the summit, which contains other halls, notably the , together with expansive views of the cities below. Beyond the summit, the back of the mountain is almost completely undeveloped, primarily featuring hiking trails. There is, however, the , a grotto with a few statues, reached by a twenty-minute hike along a rough trail. Due to difficulty reaching, this is rarely visited by tourists, though a temple event is held there on the first Sunday in March.

It uses Palladium's Megaversal system and features mutant animals – anthropomorphic and otherwise – in a post-apocalyptic setting. Setting The storyline of After the Bomb introduces a post-apocalyptic setting centered on the Eastern United States, where most of the area is populated by the mutated animals that form the majority of society. The apocalypse Advancements in genetics brought the cost of genetic manipulation down to the point where it became consumer technology. Extensive, widespread experimentation in the creation of transgenic species resulted in the creation of mutated animals, possessing traits from other animals. Although the creation of transgenic humans was technically illegal, everybody possessed a complete human genome; thus, the law was largely unenforceable, and a small population of humanoid mutant animals slowly accumulated. The same technology led to both the elimination of viral disease as a major problem, and the introduction of diseases as pranks. Kids would come to school with a vial of \\"homebrew\\" and infect the class as a joke. Because such diseases were easily cured, these pranks were regarded as \\"harmless\\". Eventually, someone came up with a way to concoct an incurable disease. A virus was created which possessed an entire copy of a human genome; any cure that targeted the disease would also target the host. This disease wiped out seventy-five percent of the world's human population. It infected most animals as well, and the animals that survived had human genes spliced in by the virus. These semi-human offspring displayed human characteristics in varying degrees. This would have merely resulted in a population mostly dominated by mutants if the leaders of the world's governments had not made the assumption that the disease was a bio-weapon sent by their enemies. The response from all sides was all-out nuclear warfare that devastated the entire planet. The game can be assumed to take place a generation or two after this apocalyptic event, which is referred to as \\"The Crash\\" or \\"The Death\\". Supplements Though the second edition of After the Bomb is a standalone with many updated rules and an entirely updated back-story, it remains compatible with the following previously released expansions: *Road Hogs (October 1986) – Expands the setting to cover the west coast of the United States. *Mutants Down Under (June 1988) – Expands the setting to cover Australia. *Mutants of the Yucatan (July 1990) – Expands the setting to cover Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. *Mutants in Avalon (January 1991) – Expands the setting to cover Great Britain. *Mutants in Orbit (March 1992) – A dual Rifts/After the Bomb title, it covers colonies in orbiting space stations, the moon and Mars. Changes since the first edition The original edition of After the Bomb was a supplement to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness, a game released in September 1985. The changes between the two editions reflect two principles. First, by the year 2000, Palladium Books no longer held the rights to publish games based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, so an edition that included a completely new rule set had to be published. Second, the original back-story was updated to reflect over fifteen years of advances in genetics. Included are expanded rules for the creation of mutants, including the ability to take animal disadvantages (vestigial traits) that enable one to purchase additional powers and/or human features. In addition, a new kind of mutant, the \\"purebred\\", has been introduced. Purebreds include creatures from well-established, stable bloodlines (as opposed to the essentially random mutations of most characters) and \\"chimeras\\", which are generally based upon transgenic creatures in existence today, such as spider goats. Reception Marcus L. Rowland reviewed After the Bomb for White Dwarf #79, and stated that \\"It's all good fun, if you can accept the basic premises involved, but seems a little limited; I find the present-day setting of the original game more satisfactory, since it offers more opportunities for plot development and diversity.\\" After the Bomb was reviewed in Different Worlds #46 (May/June, 1987), and Games Unplugged #17 (June, 2002).

After working in research at the Ministry of Supply and the Admiralty during World War II, he first made an impact with a paper on the scientific approach to documentation at a Royal Society Scientific Information Conference in 1948. He was instrumental in establishing the Institute of Information Scientists in 1958 and the first academic courses in information science in 1963 at what eventually became City University, London and where he became Director of the Centre for Information Science in 1966. Of Central European origin, his commitment to science was reflected in the name he created for himself - a combination of Faraday and Haldane, two scientists he particularly admired. On the research side his main contributions lay in relational analysis, a precursor to work in the area of artificial intelligence, and the concept of information.

Kamu was born into a family of musicians. His father played double bass in the Helsinki Philharmonic. He began violin studies at age two and entered the Sibelius Academy at age six. He formed his own string quartet, the Suhonen, in 1964 where he played first violin. At age 20, he was appointed first solo violinist at the Finnish National Opera, and held this post until 1968. He then began to conduct, initially with the Finnish National Opera orchestra. Primarily self-taught, he became principal guest conductor of the Royal Swedish Opera in 1969, the same year as he won the first Herbert von Karajan Conducting Competition in Berlin. From 1971 to 1977, Kamu was principal conductor of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Outside of Finland, Kamu was principal conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic from 1975 to 1979. He has also held leadership positions with the Stockholm Sinfonietta. He has been chief guest conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Copenhagen Philharmonic, the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra, and the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra. He was principal guest conductor of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra until 2017. Kamu was chief conductor of the Finnish National Opera from 1996 to 2000. He has been a noted conductor of the operas of Aulis Sallinen in the opera house where he conducted the premieres of The Red Line, King Lear and The Palace, and on record. He also conducted the premieres of Sallinen's 2nd and 3rd symphonies, and has recorded others. In April 2009, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra announced the appointment of Kamu as its next chief conductor, as of the autumn of 2011. Kamu's initial contract was through the spring of 2014. In November 2012, the orchestra announced the extension of Kamu's contract through the end of July 2016, at which time he concluded his tenure in Lahti. Kamu has recorded more than 100 discs for various labels, such as Finlandia and Musica Sveciae. For Naxos Records, he has recorded Franz Berwald's four symphonies and his piano concerto; Aulis Sallinen's Complete Music for String Orchestra; flute concertos by Penderecki, Takemitsu and Sallinen. Kamu's two discs of Berwald for Naxos both received the rare Diapason d'Or award. In 1994, Kamu became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. He was awarded the Order of the Lion of Finland medal in 1999 by then president of Finland Martti Ahtisaari.

The game was not a commercial or critical success, and was one of the last games by Cryo Interactive, which went bankrupt shortly after the game's failure.  Production  By the time the game was made, Cryo had already started to be in financial debt. The game turned out to be a costly flop, and the studio was unable to find creditors to keep operations running. The PlayStation 2 version was released only in Europe.  Plot  As Paul, the son of the Duke Atreides's concubine and heir to the throne, the player must earn the trust and respect from the natives of the desert planet Dune, the Fremen, to ultimately become their prophesied messiah and free them from the desolate conditions of the planet. He also needs to overcome the evil Baron Harkonnen who slaughtered the Atreides family with covert backup from the Emperor. The story behind each mission is accurate to the novels, though taking place during the two-year span in the 1965 novel Dune when Paul gains the trust of the Fremen.  Critical reception  Dune was a finalist for The Electric Playgrounds 2001 \\"Best Adventure Game for PC\\" award, but lost the prize to Myst III: Exile.

The company is most prominently known for its software AnyDVD, which can be used to bypass copy protection measures on optical media, including DVD and Blu-ray Disc media, as well as CloneCD, which is used to back up the contents of optical discs. The company formerly operated as the St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda-based SlySoft. At some point in February 2016, SlySoft shut down, with its home page replaced by a message citing \\"recent regulatory requirements\\". On or around February 16, 2016, AACS LA had requested that the Office of the United States Trade Representative place Antigua and Barbuda on its Priority Watch List of countries that fail to prevent intellectual property violations, with specific reference to SlySoft. However, the company's online forum remained online, and had replaced the brand SlySoft with \\"RedFox\\". SlySoft developers also revealed that none of the company's staff were actually based in Antigua, that the company was not involved in legal settlements from AACS LA, and that key staff members still had access to SlySoft's technical infrastructure—including build systems and licensing servers—feasibly allowing development of AnyDVD to continue. On 2 March 2016, SlySoft reformed as RedFox, under a top-level domain based in Belize, and released a new version of AnyDVD. Products * AnyDVD to remove/disable DRM restrictions and user prohibited operations on DVD films, and to fix structure protections and mastering errors * AnyDVD HD - to remove DRM, lock-outs, and UOPs on DVD films and additionally High Definition media, specifically Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD * AnyStream - to download and remove DRM from streaming video on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix * CloneCD - to copy optical discs in raw format * CloneDVD mobile - to convert DVD files to mobile video players like the iPod or the PlayStation Portable * Game Jackal - to create CD profiles so a disc isn't required when starting the game * Game Jackal Enterprise - extended version of Game Jackal with additional features such as automatic distribution of game profiles to client machines Some products are now supported by Elaborate Bytes such as Clone DVD and Virtual CloneDrive. AACS and BD+ SlySoft was the first to offer AACS circumvention that worked for any disc available; previous programs only cracked \\"compatible\\" discs using a database of known keys. On 8 November 2007, SlySoft claimed to have completely cracked BD+. However, this turned out to be incorrect, as subsequent versions of BD+ security code have caused SlySoft to re-design its software. On 3 March 2008, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD allowing the full decryption of BD+, allowing for not only the viewing of the film itself but also playing and copying disks with third-party software. A third iteration of BD+ was released in November 2008, and was announced to be cracked by SlySoft with the release of AnyDVD HD 6.5.0.2 on 29 December 2008. A fourth version of BD+ security code was discovered with the movie Australia on 17 February 2009, thwarting the effectiveness of SlySoft's software. However, on 19 March 2009, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD to version 6.5.3.1 which allowed the decryption of the new version of BD+ used by Australia.  Licensing  On 1 December 2008 SlySoft announced it would for the first time begin charging its customers for updates to its software. In November 2010, SlySoft initially announced the discontinuation of the lifetime licensing option beginning January 2011. An e-mail announcing the change ahead of time was sent to all registered customers allowing everyone the chance to purchase the lifetime option \\"while it is still possible;\\" and the notice was posted to their official forums. In January 2011, all announcements regarding the change were deleted without comment and a new structured licensing plan was put into place; including the lifetime licensing option at the highest priced tier. SlySoft was able to balance the internal cost matter and the licensing strategy in such a way as to allow continuation of the \\"lifetime\\" license option. The 'update service' will only allow updates with a valid license and users are warned if they attempt to install an update beyond the license expiry date. If the user cancels the update the current paid-up license will continue to work. If the user continues then a \\"renewal\\" is required. Following the collapse of Slysoft, holders of a SlySoft AnyDVD/AnyDVD HD Lifetime License are required to purchase a new license for use with the RedFox software beginning with Version 8.0.2.0. Version 7.6.9.5 will be able to use the prior license interminably; however, it will not have access to updates for the latest decryption of copy- protection.https://forum.redfox.bz/threads/redfox-licensing-pricing.69083/ See also *AnyDVD *CloneCD *CloneDVD *DVD ripper software with similar features *DVD Shrink *HandBrake *K9Copy ReferencesFurther reading *\\"Appapalooza\\", Computer Power User (CPU), October 2009 • Vol.9 Issue 10, Pages 60–70 *\\"What's Happening\\", Computer Power User (CPU), January 2008 • Vol.8 Issue 1, Pages 6–11 *\\"What's Happening\\", Computer Power User (CPU), March 2009 • Vol.9 Issue 3, Pages 9–16 *\\"The Bleeding Edge Of Software\\", Computer Power User (CPU), February 2009 • Vol.9 Issue, 2 Page 72 External links   Elaborate Bytes Category:Software companies of Belize Category:Cryptography companies Category:Disk image emulators Category:Notorious markets Category:Belizean brands ","title":"RedFox"},{"id":"4431051","text":"Pratul Chandra Ganguli (1884–1957) was a Bengali Indian revolutionary.

It consists of five genera with over 240 species, most of which are endemic to Australia and New Zealand. Members of Stylidiaceae are typically grass-like herbs or small shrubs and can be perennials or annuals. Most species are free standing or self-supporting, though a few can be climbing or scrambling (Stylidium scandens uses leaf tips recurved into hooks to climb). The pollination mechanisms of Stylidium and Levenhookia are as follows: In Stylidium the floral column, which consists of the fused stamen and style, springs violently from one side (usually under the flower) when triggered. This deposits the pollen on a visiting insect. In Levenhookia, however, the column is immobile, but the hooded labellum is triggered and sheds pollen. In 1981, only about 155 species were known in the family. The current number of species by genus (reported in 2002) is as follows: Forstera - 5, Levenhookia - 10, Oreostylidium - 1, Phyllachne - 4, and Stylidium - 221. These numbers, especially for Stylidium, are changing rapidly as new species are described.Wagstaff, S.J. and Wege, J. (2002). Patterns of diversification in New Zealand Stylidiaceae. American Journal of Botany, 89(5): 865-874. (Available online: HTML or PDF versions). Stylidium rotundifolium appeared in Joseph Banks' Florilegium (plate 173), drawn from a specimen collected at Endeavour River, Australia in 1770.https://www.typeandforme.com/index.php/2018/10/06/discovering-the- unexpected-travel-catalogue/ accessed 10 Oct 18 Taxonomy The genus Donatia is sometimes included in Stylidiaceae in the monogeneric subfamily Donatioideae. The APG II system recommends its inclusion in Stylidiaceae but allows for the optional recognition of the family Donatiaceae.Stylidiaceae (at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website) Molecular and phylogenetic analysis have determined that Donatia is a sister-group to Stylidiaceae and therefore placing Donatia in its own family has been recommended by several authorities. Including Donatia within the Stylidiaceae would endanger its status as a monophyletic group.Laurent, N., Bremer, B., and Bremer, K. (1999). Phylogeny and generic interrelationships of the Stylidiaceae (Asterales), with a possible extreme case of floral paedomorphosis. Systematic Botany, 23(3): 289-304. Donatioideae and Stylidioideae were described by Johannes Mildbraed in his 1908 taxonomic monograph of the family. The subfamilies were created to distinguish the difference between the five typical genera of the Stylidiaceae from the single genus Donatia, which Mildbraed placed in Donatioideae.Mildbraed, J. (1908). Stylidiaceae. In Engler, A. Das Pflanzenreich: Regni vegetabilis conspectus, IV. 278. Leipzig, 1908. The subfamily taxonomy represents the taxonomic uncertainty of Donatia, which has often been placed in its own family, Donatiaceae, or other families such as the Saxifragaceae.Good, R. (1925). On the geographical distribution of the Stylidiaceae. New Phytologist, 24(4): 225-240. Mildbraed's classification also included two tribes: Phyllachneae, which included the genera Forstera and Phyllachne, and Stylidieae, which included Levenhookia, Oreostylidium, and Stylidium. This level of infraspecific taxonomy is not used in recent research, but the groupings are supported by molecular data that suggest Forstera and Phyllachne are closely related but distinct from the other three. APG II places Stylidiaceae and Donatiaceae in the Asterales. The Cronquist system placed both families in the Campanulales. The Takhtajan and Reveal systems place both families in the order Stylidiales. The Dahlgren system uses the same Stylidiales order, but it omits Donatiaceae. The Thorne system shifts Stylidiaceae into the Saxifragales order.

History Cryptal Darkness started life as a grindcore/death Metal band, that later changed styles and became doom band from Melbourne. With the line up of Mark Kelson, Oneil Alexander (drums), Geoff Kloprogge (vocals, guitar) and Jade Von Nagy (bass) the band released a four track single, Descend into Thy Grave and shortly thereafter the debut album Endless Tears, which has recently been re-released for international distribution. An opening slot at the 1997 Metal for the Brain festival raised awareness of the band somewhat, and much of 1998 was spent working on new material. Former Paramaecium guitarist Chris Burton replaced Kloprogge in 1997 and after some time as a temporary member, Luke Wong finally joined as full-time bassist mid-1998. Around the same time the band started working with ex-My Dying Bride keyboards player Martin Powell, who came to Australia to join the band and record \\"They Whispered You Had Risen\\", which displays a more Gothic character than earlier work. Cryptal Darkness had plans to tour Europe in late 2000, but this seems to have not occurred. Kelson has also featured in the Paramaecium line-up and Alexander played drums for Vomitorial Corpulence; both were also members of Desolate Eternity.

Sze's work explores the role of technology and information in contemporary life utilizing everyday materials. Drawing from Modernist traditions, Sze's work often represents objects caught in suspension. Sze lives and works in New York City and is a professor of visual arts at Columbia University.  Early life and education  Sze was born in Boston in 1969. Sze attributes her approach to seeing the world to growing up around models and plans and to regular discussions of buildings and cities. She received a BA from Yale University in 1991 and an MFA from New York's School of Visual Arts in 1997. Career 96th Street subway station Sze draws from Modernist traditions of the found object, to build large scale installations. She uses everyday items like string, Q-tips, photographs, and wire to create complex constellations whose forms change with the viewer's interaction. The effect of this is to \\"challenge the very material of sculpture, the very constitution of sculpture, as a solid form that has to do with finite geometric constitutions, shapes, and content.\\" When selecting materials, Sze focuses on the exploration of value acquisition–what value the object holds and how it is acquired. In an interview with curator Okwui Enwezor, Sze explained that during her conceptualization process, she will \\"choreograph the experience to create an ebb and flow of information [...] thinking about how people approach, slow down, stop, perceive [her art].\\" Sze represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 2013, and was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2003. Her work has been featured in The Whitney Biennial (2000), the Carnegie International (1999) and several international biennials, including Berlin (1998), Guangzhou (2015), Liverpool (2008), Lyon (2009), São Paulo (2002), and Venice (1999, 2013, and 2015). Sze has also created public artworks for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Walker Art Center, and the High Line in New York. On January 1, 2017, a permanent installation commissioned by MTA Arts & Design of drawings by Sze on ceramic tiles opened in the 96th Street subway station on the new Second Avenue Subway line in New York City. Sze unveiled Shorter than the Day, a permanent installation, in LaGuardia Airport in 2020.  Influences  Sze's work is influenced, in part, by her admiration for Cubists, Russian Constructivists, and Futurists. Particularly, their attempt to \\"depict the speed and intensity of the moment and the impossibility of its stillness.\\"  Personal life  Sze lives in New York City with her husband Siddhartha Mukherjee, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Emperor of All Maladies who teaches medicine at Columbia University, and their two daughters. Sarah’s great-grandfather, who had a waist-length queue, was the first Chinese student (Alfred Sao-ke Sze) to go to Cornell University. He became China’s minister to Britain and then ambassador to the United States. Her father, Chia-Ming Sze, was born in Shanghai; his family fled China when he was four, and resettled in the United States. He became an architect and married Judy Mossman, an Anglo-Scottish-Irish schoolteacher. Sarah and David, her older brother, grew up in Boston. (David, one of the first investors in Facebook, is a venture capitalist at Greylock Partners.) Sarah went to Milton Academy as a day student and graduated summa cum laude from Yale in 1991. Throughout her childhood, she was constantly drawing—at the dinner table, on the train, wherever she was.https://www.vogue.com/article/sarah-sze-siddhartha-mukherjee-brilliant- couple-profile-sculptor-writer-physician-scientist-researcher Her grandfather is Szeming Sze who was the initiator of World Health Organization.

Since version 1.7.0 optional support for key based database encryption (128 bit AES) is included. Starting with version 1.9.6 of wxSQLite3 the encryption extension is compatible with the SQLite amalgamation source and includes the extension functions module. Support for 256 bit AES encryption has been added in version 1.9.8. Since version 3.5.0 the SQLite library is an integrated part of wxSQLite3. Since version 4.0.0 wxSQLite3 supports to select the encryption scheme at runtime.

History Bishop's Residence Galveston TX, (postcard c. 1900) The Gresham mansion was made all of stone, and was sturdy enough to withstand the great hurricane of 1900. The Greshams welcomed hundreds of survivors of the hurricane into their home.Teague, Wells (2000). Calling Texas Home: A Lively Look at What It Means to Be a Texan, p. 96. Wildcat Canyon Press. The house was built between 1887 and 1893 by Galveston architect Nicholas J. Clayton for lawyer and politician Walter Gresham, his wife Josephine, and their nine children. In 1923 the Roman Catholic Diocese of Galveston purchased the house, and, situated across the street from the Sacred Heart Church, it served as the residence for Bishop Christopher E. Byrne.McComb, David G. (2002). Galveston: A History, p. 65. University of Texas Press. After the diocesan offices were moved to Houston, the diocese opened the mansion to the public in 1963, with proceeds from tours being used to help fund the Newman Center, operating in the basement, serving Catholic students at the nearby University of Texas Medical Branch. The home is estimated to have cost $250,000 at the time ; today its value is estimated at over $5.5 million. The house is owned by the Galveston Historical Foundation and self-guided tours are available daily. A portion of each admission supports the preservation and restoration of the property. Layout Circa 1970 View from he West. An atypical view Lion of St Mark outside Bishop's Palace Bishop's Palace has four floors.

The film's title is an allusion to a line of Alexander Pope's poem \\"Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot\\": \\"Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?\\" The line is usually interpreted as questioning why someone would put great effort into achieving something minor or unimportant, or who would punish a minor offender with a disproportional punishment. Plot Chicago residents Neil Randall (Gerard Butler) and his wife, Abby Randall (Maria Bello) have the perfect life and a perfect marriage. With their beautiful young daughter, Sophie, they are living the American dream until Sophie is suddenly kidnapped. Neil and Abby have no choice but to comply with the abductor's demands. The kidnapper, Tom Ryan (Pierce Brosnan), an apparent sociopath, takes over their lives with the brutal efficiency of someone who has nothing to lose. In the blink of an eye, Neil and Abby's safe and secure existence is turned upside down. Ryan doesn't want their money and instead wants their life to be systematically dismantled and destroyed, piece by piece. With time running out, Neil and Abby realize they have to submit to Ryan's challenges over the next 24-hour period. Tom asks them how far will they go to save their child, and gives them a series of tasks to complete before they can have their daughter back. He requires them to withdraw more than $130,000 from their bank which is all the money they have. After they give Tom the money, he burns it and throws into a river along with their wallets. Tom then requires the pair to get $300 from nowhere in a part of the town where they don't have any friends. Abby pawns her bracelet and Neil his watch to get the $300. Tom requires Abby to deliver a document to Neil's office within twenty minutes, and Tom shows Neil a copy of document that contains details of Neil's hacking into customer accounts, which if leaked will ruin Neil. Neil watches Abby deliver the document from a distance. Neil and Abby think that Sophie is being held in a hotel, and they try to rescue her, only to get caught by Tom. As punishment, Tom makes Abby take off her dress and put on an enticing short dress in front of both him and Neil. Tom has one last test for Neil to save Sophie, in which he requires Neil to enter a house and kill the occupant - a coworker named Judy who Neil has been having an affair with. Neil is greeted warmly by Judy, and is desperately confused as he sees a picture of Tom on the mantel and learns that Tom and Judy are married. Tom enters the house and tells Neil to shoot Judy or he will kill Neil's daughter Sophie. Neil pulls the trigger but the gun isn't loaded. Tom reveals he knows about their affair and tells Neil his daughter is safe at home. As they return home, Neil lies to Abby and tells her that his boss was having an affair with Judy and Tom mistook Neil for that person, which is why Tom had tormented them the whole day. When they return home, Sophie is asleep and has been there the whole time. Abby reveals to Neil that their daughter had never been kidnapped, and Tom had concocted the entire day to let Neil experience for one day the pain he has undergone. Neil says that Abby has ruined his career by delivering the document to his office, but she tells him it was blank. Abby has paid Neil back for 24 hours a portion of the pain she has experienced since learning of his affair, revealing she was involved in the deception. CastProduction Pierce Brosnan joined the film's cast in late 2005. Maria Bello and Gerard Butler joined production on 19 January 2006. Filming began in February 2006 and finished in May 2006.

Colophon  There have been claims that the earlier document's colophon identifies it as being a 'copy' rendered from a manuscript dating 164 CE, internally documented as 100 years after the great persecution of the Christians by Nero, in 64 CE – however the colophon is unreadable. To this day, there is no published transcription.  Provenance  The Khaboris codex was obtained by Norman Malek-Yonan and attorney Dan MacDougald in 1966 for $25,000. It \\"was purchased from the library of an ancient Assyrian monastery atop one of the mountains of Assyria, near the River Habbor, or in Aramaic, Khabur, hence the name 'Khaburis'.\\" It seems both men went overseas looking for a more intact Aramaic version of the New Testament following Malek-Yonan's experiences surrounding the Yonan Codex in the 1950s. Malek-Yonan's prior codex had been repaired with newer materials at some point in its history. He claimed the Yonan Codexb had been in his family since the 4th century. In his account of the controversial history surrounding the Yonan codexb, Christian Greek-primacist Bruce Metzger tells of dating it to the 7th century at its earliest. The stories of the Yonan Codexa and the Khaboris Codexb are linked by the involvement of Dan MacDougald. On page 115 of the Society of Biblical Literature's reprint of The Saga of the Yonan Codex, Metzger tells of getting news of the Yonan Codex in the late 1970s. He writes, > \\"Curiously enough, several year [sic] later while I was attending sessions > of the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion, Dr. Paul L. > Garber, professor of Bible at Agnes Scott College, Decatur, Georgia, > casually inquired of me whether I had ever heard of the Yonan Codexa. This > led to a most astonishing disclosure. A medieval copy (Khabourisb) of the > manuscript, Garber told me, was in the possession of the Emotional Maturity > Instruction Center, Decatur, Georgia. The center had transliterated the > Syriac text of the Beatitudes in Christ's Sermon on the Mount (Matthew > 5:3–12) and was making a copy of this available for four dollars with the > assurance that, by concentrating each day on these sentences in Aramaic, > one's personality would become adjusted and more mature. In fact, according > to Garber the center had even persuaded magistrates in Atlanta to buy copies > of the transliteration for use in attempting to quell obstreperous > prisoners!\\" A Western Queens Gazette article from August 8, 2004 states that Dan MacDougald was the one who started the Emotional Maturity Instruction course referred to by Metzger. According to Timms, Norman Malek-Yonan died in the 1970s. Apparently MacDougald had purchased the Khaboris codex from Yonan, and started a few organizations dealing with psychology in the 1970s. After the 1999 dating by the University of Arizona, the Khaboris Codexb transitioned into the hands of Dr. Michael Ryce at the Heartland institute. Ryce co- authored an updated version of the Emotional Maturity Instruction course with MacDougald called Laws of Living. This course continues to be taught, annually, by Ryce at Heartland, his teaching center in the Ozark Mountains of Southern Missouri. The Heartland's website states on a page about the Khaboris Codexb, \\"Before Dan MacDougald passed away, he left the Khabourisb in the stewardship of the Western-Rite Syrian Orthodox Church, in order that the validation, documentation, conservation, translation, publication and exhibition could be completed. Work continues on these processes, as well as development of several related books.\\" The manuscripts appears to have remained physically at the Heartland institute. A page titled \\"The Khabouris Manuscript Ceremony at Heartland\\" has several small images of a woman posing with the \\"b\\" codex. At some point during this time, someone there seems to have taken low-resolution digital photos of all 500 plus pages of the codex. At some point around 2004 the codex was sent to New York have high-resolution photos taken by Eric Rivera, director of the Khabouris Institute, working at the Better Light Company, a digital imaging company. Their website has a description of Rivera's work and a few high-quality image samples. During this time the Khabouris Manuscriptb was on display for public view as an exhibit in the Queensborough Community College Art Gallery in Bayside, New York. This likely generated the Western Queens Gazette article referenced above. Rivera mentions working on the manuscript in 2005, after which it appears to have been stolen. The Heartland website states, \\"The Khabouris Manuscript(b) was removed from QCC (without our prior knowledge) and was taken to London for auction by Sotheby's back in June 2007. The sale was not completed at that time; however, we have lost track of where the actual Manuscript is now located.\\" It appears to have been purchased by Arizona collector James Melikian. On December 11, 2007 the Phoenix Art Museum hosted a display of old manuscripts, including the Khaboris Codexb. The article announcing the display described it as being part of the James Melikian collection. Melikian, a resident of Phoenix, is Armenian and has cultural interests in collecting ancient Oriental Christian artifacts. He talks about this in the January 12, 2008 edition of the Armenian Reporter.

It is one of the churches of the Saint Thomas Christian community, which traces its origins to the evangelical activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. This group split off from the main body of India's Malankara Church in 1772 and was confirmed as an independent church with its current name after a high court verdict in 1862. Although the church is independent under the Malankara umbrella, the church faith and traditions are strictly Oriental Orthodox, adhering to the West Syriac Rite and consistently using western Syriac and Malayalam during the Holy Qurbana (Qurbono Qadisho). Today the church remains small, with about 5,000 members, and maintains good relations with the other Malankara churches. A diagram showing the history of the divisions among the Saint Thomas Christians (click to enlarge). History The Saint Thomas Christians trace their origins to Thomas the Apostle, who according to tradition proselytized in India in the 1st century. By the 7th century they were part of the Church of the East, centred in Persia.Baum, p. 53. The entire community remained united until the 17th century, when disputes with the Portuguese padroado in India led to the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653 and the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Catholic and independent branches.Neill, p. 214.Neill, p. 319. The independent branch, known as the Malankara Church, forged a relationship with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch.\\"Christians of Saint Thomas\\". Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved February 9, 2010. However, relations between the Syriac Orthodox hierarchy and the native clergy were sometimes strained. In 1772 Bishop Mar Gregorios, a representative of the Syriac Orthodox hierarchy from the Middle East, had grown dissatisfied with how the Metropolitan Mar Dionysius I had treated him. Against Dionysius' wishes, Gregorios consecrated as bishop a leading dissenter, the monk Kattumangatt Kurien, in a secret but canonically legitimate ceremony. The new bishop took the name Mar Cyril (Koorilos), and he was designated Gregorios' sole heir.Neill, p. 70. Cyril claimed authority over the parishes of Cochin, and initially received the support of the Raja of Cochin. However, Dionysus saw him as a threat to his power, and in 1774 he appealed to the Raja and to the British authorities in India to suppress the rival bishop.Vadakkekara, p. 92. Cyril left for Thozhiyoor, Kerala outside their jurisdiction, and established what would become an independent church.Burgess, p. 175. This was the first of several groups to split from the Malankara Church. Cyril's church was always small, but maintained stability by attracting devoted priests and emphasizing regularity in the ecclesiastical order. In 1794 Cyril consecrated his brother Geevarghese as bishop; Geevarghese succeeded Cyril as Mar Cyril II in 1802, and the succession has proceeded unbroken since. As a result of an 1862 court case, the Madras High Court confirmed the Thozhiyur church was an independent Malankara church, and it has subsequently been known as the Malabar Independent Syrian Church. Ecumenical relations The Malabar Independent Syrian Church maintains good relations with the other Malankara churches especially its relationship with Marthoma Syrian church. Despite its small size, it has had a significant impact on the history of the Saint Thomas Christian community. On several occasions Thoziyur bishops have stepped in to consecrate bishops for the other churches when the episcopal succession, and therefore the churches themselves, were in danger. Mar Philoxenos II Kidangan (1811–1829) of the Thozhiyur Church consecrated three successive bishops in the unified Malankara Church: Mar Dionysius II on 22 March 1816, Mar Dionysius III on 19 October 1817, and Mar Dionysius IV on 27 August 1825.Rev. K. C. Varghese Kassessa. (1972). History of Malabar Independent Syrian Church. (Malayam). Page 62. In 1894 Mar Athanasius and Mar Koorilose V consecrated Titus I Mar Thoma for the Reformed Syrians, later known as the Mar Thoma Church. On subsequent occasions when the Thozhiyur Metropolitan has died without consecrating a successor, the Metropolitan and bishops of the Mar Thoma Church had performed the consecration. Thozhiyur bishops have taken part in all Mar Thoma Church episcopal ordinations up to the present. Malabar Independent Syrian Church is a member of the Christian Conference of Asia, the Council of Churches in India, and the Kerala Council of Churches. Other ecumenical links have been developed, not least with the Anglican and Lutheran Churches. This has been facilitated through a support group based in England, which is a registered charitable trust. In 1998 and 2008, Thozhiyur Church Metropolitans were ecumenical observers at the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops. In July 2006 Mar Koorilose IX and Mar Basilios I participated as co- consecrators in the episcopal ordination of Paul Hunt and John Fenwick as bishops of the Free Church of England.

Temporary plant  Temporary gas-oil separation facilities are associated with newly drilled or newly sidetracked wells where the production potential of the well is being assessed. The plant, comprising a test separator vessel, is connected to the well head after the choke valve. The separator allows the fluids to separate by gravity into its component phases: solids such as sand (the densest phase) settle to the bottom of the separator, then produced water and oil which are drawn separately from the base of the separator, and vapor or gas (the lightest phase) separates to the top of the separator vessel from where it is withdrawn. Each of the three fluid phases is metered to determine the relative flow-rates of the components and production potential of the well. In temporary facilities the vapor is generally flared; produced water is disposed of overboard after treatment to reduce its oil content to statutory levels; and the crude oil phase may be diverted to tote tanks for removal and treatment onshore. Alternatively if the temporary GOSP plant is associated with a permanent production facility the oil phase may be treated in the installation's permanent gas-oil separation plant.  Permanent plant  Permanent gas-oil separation plant is associated with permanent production offshore facilities. A full description of such plant is provided in the article Oil production plant. A gas/oil and water separator is called a 3-phase separator. The gas and oil/condensate are pumped through designated pipelines, while the sand and other solids are washed from the separator and are disposed of overboard. Reasons for processing= Multi-phase production  Water need not be separated, and a single liquid (oil and water) phase produced together with a separate gas phase. Chemicals are added so that the crude and water emulsify. This process is then reversed at the storage and processing facility by adding demulsifiers that make the water separate out, and is drawn from the bottom of the tank. After storage the crude oil can be sold to refineries, that produce fuels, chemicals and energy products. Pressure The well fluids at the well-head are at high pressure. Production pressures of greater than are not uncommon, but typically are lower than this. The high pressure is reduced at the choke valve to typically 7 to 30 bar at the separator, although the first stage separator could operate at higher pressure c. 250 bar. Modern oil recovery practise may place a hydro-cyclone to replace the temporary GOSP, allowing the water to be removed immediately and re-injected into the reservoir. The hydro-cyclone will vary the flows according to the water content and can also separate condensate from the gas where separate storage and export can be provided for the products close to the production well (e.g. on offshore platforms). Contaminants Crude oil leaving the well may contain quantities of sulfur (e.g. hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans) or carbon dioxide and is known as \\"sour\\" crude. The gas-oil separator will typically partition the hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide preferentially into the vapor or gas phase, where it may be further treated. The most usual \\"crude sweetening packages\\" use amines to remove the sulphur and CO2 content. Crude that contains water is called \\"wet\\", and the water can then be bound in an emulsion in the crude to allow pumping through a pipeline. The crude is processed and treated to make it acceptable for the entry and transportation specification of the pipeline, before it can be transported to a refinery for processing. Phase separation It is often appropriate to separate gases and liquids for separate processing. This also involves the separation of oily and water liquid phases. Gas recovery In the past, the gas was considered a waste product and was burned or flared off. By recovering the gas, carbon emissions are reduced, and a marketable commodity is produced.

It is located in a hilly country on the right bank of the Danube, just east of the mouth of the river Ogosta, a few more kilometres downstream from where the Jiu flows into the Danube on Romanian territory. The town is known for the ferry service that connects it to the Romanian town of Bechet across the river. There are also plans by local private companies for a bridge across the Danube. As of December 2009, Oryahovo has a population of 5,400 inhabitants. History Oryahovo in 30s of XX century Ancient history and Middle Ages The town's name has evolved through the course of history, with names such as Vrhov, Orezov, Oreov and Rahovo being mentioned in documents until the current one was officially established in 1886. The area around Oryahovo has been inhabited since ancient times, as archaeological research has proven with findings from the early Neolithic to the Late Middle Ages. A fortress called Kamaka (Камъка) is located 1 km east from Oryahovo, which existed from the 9th to the 14th century. In 1396, the city, already controlled by the Ottoman Turks, was sacked and its Ottoman civilian inhabitants killed while the prisoners massacred by French crusaders heading towards Nicopolis. The troops of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and Polish King Władysław III of Varna passed through the fortress during their unsuccessful crusades (the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 and the Battle of Varna in 1444, respectively) against the Ottoman Empire. Bulgarian National Revival During the Bulgarian National Revival, Oryahovo established itself as an economic and industrial centre and a key point for the supply of the Ottoman Empire with goods through the Danube. The town was mentioned as an important Danube port in a 1762 book printed in Brussels. The St George Church was opened in 1837, a secular school was built in the town in 1857 and a community centre (читалище, chitalishte) followed in 1871. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, the town was liberated on 21 November 1877 by Romanian forces after three-day fighting. A memorial by Italian sculptor Arnaldo Zocchi was erected in their honour. Liberated Bulgaria Orthodox Church After the liberation, Oryahovo was known for the lively trade and rich cultural life. A provincial centre for three months, it became the centre of an okrag for 10 years (1877-1882 and 1884-1889). The architecture from the period is typically influenced by the one of Western Europe, with many such buildings being preserved today. A railway line linking Oryahovo with Cherven Bryag was constructed in 1926, a new church, the Assumption of Mary Church, opened in 1930, and a new building for the community centre was built in 1936 after a project by two Vidin architects. Some of the first industrial companies in the city, a spare parts factory and a metalworking company, were opened in 1961. Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, a short drive west of town, is also a major employer. The ferry Oryahovo - Beckett, crossing Danube, is one of the main transport corridors from Bulgaria to Romania. This is the most direct route from Sofia to Romania, Ukraine and other countries.

Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. The software allows online shopping customers to accumulate a list of items for purchase. At the point of sale, the software typically calculates a total for the order, including freight transport, postage as well as packaging and labeling. Associated taxes are calculated as applicable. The data is used in online marketing.  History  The development of web shop systems took place right after the Internet became a mass medium. This was a result of the launch of the browser Mosaic in 1993 and Netscape in 1994. It created an environment in which web shops were possible. The Internet therefore acted as the key infrastructure developments that contributed to the rapid diffusion of the e-commerce, a subset of e-business that describes all computer-aided business transactions. In 1998 a total of 11 e-business models were observed, one of which was the e-shop business model for a B2C (business-to-consumer) business—also called the “online shop” The two terms “online shop” and “electronic” or “e-shop” are used interchangeably. The term “online shopping” was invented much earlier in 1984. Today the term primarily refers to the business-to-consumer transactional business. In order to enable “online shopping” a software system is needed. Since “online shopping”, in the context of the B2C business model, became broadly available to the end consumer, internet-based “online shops” evolved.  Technical definition  These applications typically provide a means of capturing a client's payment information, but in the case of a credit card they rely on the software module of the secure gateway provider, in conjunction with the secure payment gateway, in order to conduct secure credit card transactions online. Some setup must be done in the HTML code of the website, and the shopping cart software must be installed on the server which hosts the site, or on the secure server which accepts sensitive ordering information. E-shopping carts are usually implemented using HTTP cookies or query strings. In most server based implementations however, data related to the shopping cart is kept in the session object and is accessed and manipulated on the fly, as the user selects different items from the cart. Later at the process of finalizing the transaction, the information is accessed and an order is generated against the selected item thus clearing the shopping cart. Although the most simple shopping carts strictly allow for an item to be added to a basket to start a checkout process (e.g., the free PayPal shopping cart), most shopping cart software provides additional features that an Internet merchant uses to fully manage an online store. Data (products, categories, discounts, orders, customers, etc.) is normally stored in a database and accessed in real time by the software. Shopping Cart Software is also known as e-commerce software, e-store software, online store software or storefront software and online shop.  Components  * Storefront: the area of the Web store that is accessed by visitors to the online shop. Category, product, and other pages (e.g., search, bestsellers, etc.) are dynamically generated by the software based on the information saved in the store database. The look of the storefront can normally be changed by the store owner so that it merges with the rest of the web site (i.e., with the pages not controlled by the shopping cart software in use on the store). * Administration: the area of the Web store that is accessed by the merchant to manage the online shop. The amount of store management features changes depending on the sophistication of the shopping cart software chosen by the merchant, but in general a store manager is able to add and edit products, categories, discounts, shipping and payment settings, etc. Order management features are also included in many shopping cart programs. The administration area can be: ** Web-based (accessed through a web browser) ** Desktop-based (a desktop application that runs on the user's computer and then transfers changes to the storefront component).  Types  Shopping cart software can be generally categorized into three types of E-commerce software: * Open source software: The software is released under an open source licence and is very often free of charge. The merchant has to host the software with a Web hosting service. It allows users to access and modify the source code of the entire online store. * Licensed software: The software is downloaded and then installed on a Webserver. This is most often associated with a one-time fee, the main advantages of this option are that the merchant owns a license and therefore can host it on any web server that meets the server requirements. * Hosted service: The software is never downloaded, but rather is provided by a hosted service provider and is generally paid for on a monthly or annual basis; also known as the application service provider (ASP) software model. Some of these services also charge a percentage of sales in addition to the monthly fee. This model often has predefined templates that a user can choose from to customize their look and feel. Predefined templates limit how much users can modify or customize the software with the advantage of having the vendor continuously keep the software up to date for security patches as well as adding new features.

It forms approximately the southern half of the non-coastal areas of that state. The area corresponds almost exactly to that of the erstwhile princely state of Mysore. Almost all of that principality, with the exception of a few areas that now lie in neighbouring states, is comprehended by this term. The region lies on the Deccan plateau, east of the hilly Malenadu region, which includes the eastern foothills of the Western Ghats range. It consists of gently rolling plains, punctuated by several of the large rivers that rise in the Western Ghats and flow eastward to empty into the Bay of Bengal. Mysore region, also known as the Southern Karnataka Plateau, is made up of the low rolling granite hills from 600 to 900 meters elevation. It is bounded on the west by the Western Ghats and on the south and east by ranges of hills or Eastern Ghats, and on the north it drops to the lower-elevation northern Maidan. It includes Bangalore, Bangalore Rural, Chamrajnagar, Hassan, Kolar, Chikkaballapura, Mandya, Mysore, Ramanagara, chitradurga, davangere and Tumkur districts. Most of the region is covered by the South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests ecoregion, which extends south into eastern Tamil Nadu. Some of the larger cities and towns of the Maidan include Bangalore, Mysore, Tumkur, Chitradurga and Davangere. Agriculture and animal husbandry are the mainstays of the region, and the main crops include cotton, sorghum, millet, and peanuts. The region lies in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats, and is generally much drier than coastal Karnataka and the Western Ghats. It was originally covered by extensive, open-canopied Tropical dry deciduous forests, characterized by the trees Acacia, Albizia and Hardwickia, but much of the original forest has been cleared for agriculture, timber, grazing and firewood. Overexploitation of the forests for fuelwood and fodder has resulted in much of the original forest being degraded into thickets and scrublands. Canthium parriflorum, Cassia auriculata, Dodonaea viscosa, Erythroxylum monogynum, Pterolobium hexapetalum and Euphorbia antiquorum are species typical of the thicket and scrubland vegetation.

Dr. A.C. Horner, an amateur geologist living at Tonbridge, in the nineteenth century acquired a fossil found in the quarry of Southborough. He sent it to paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley who in 1882 described and named it as the type species Thecospondylus horneri. The genus name is derived from Greek theke meaning 'sheath' and spondylos meaning 'vertebra', a reference to the \\"extremely thin\\" bone forming the vertebrae. The specific name honours Horner.*H.G. Seeley, 1882, \\"On Thecospondylus Horneri, a new dinosaur from the Hastings Sand, indicated by the sacrum and the neural canal of the sacral region\\", Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London 38: 457-460 The holotype, BMNH R.291, was found in a layer of the Hastings Sand, sandstone dating from the Valanginian - Hauterivian. It consist of an elongated natural internal cast or endocast of the neural canal of the sacrum, about sixty centimetres long. It shows the divisions of at least five and probably seven sacral vertebrae. On three of them the cancellous bone is still present to which the generic name is referring. It is the only known fossil that can be definitely assigned to this genus. A second species, T. daviesi, was added by Seeley in 1888, but later given its own genus, Thecocoelurus. In 1926 Friedrich von Huene renamed T. horneri to Thecocoelurus horneri,F. v. Huene, 1926, \\"The carnivorous Saurischia in the Jura and Cretaceous formations, principally in Europe\\", Revista del Museo de La Plata 29: 35-167 but this has not been commonly accepted, because Thecospondylus would have priority. Based on such meagre material, the affinities of T. horneri have been hard to determine. Seeley himself merely assigned it to Dinosauria. Richard Lydekker in 1888 referred it to the Sauropoda. Von Huene however in 1909 considered it to be a member of the theropod family Coeluridae. Recent authors conclude it is a nomen dubium, of which it is not even certain whether it is a saurischian or an ornithischian.

The most common example in the United States is the $??.99 phenomenon—e.g. setting the price for a good at $9.99. Though it is effectively ten dollars—especially when you add sales tax—it still appears to the potential buyer to be significantly cheaper than if the good was sold $10.00. Economists and advertising analysts note that should a company need to increase the price of a product beyond the threshold price-point, it should only be done in small amounts. If a candy bar originally cost $1.99, then there is apparently little difference in making the new price $2.05 or even $2.25. The logic behind the move is that while some potential buyers will be lost by the increase in price beyond the threshold, those that stay will not notice the difference in prices between thresholds. Buyers do not make judgement calls on a per-cent basis, so will not differentiate between $2.05 and $2.06. However, they do differentiate at thresholds. So while you wouldn't necessarily lose a buyer jumping from $2.05 and $2.06, you could lose one going from $1.99 to $2.00. Therefore companies can actually increase overall profit despite losing customers by increasing the revenue per buyer significantly.

Discovery and naming In 1911, German geologist Wilhelm Bornhardt at Nambango in German East Africa discovered two sauropod vertebrae, fifteen kilometers (nine miles) southeast of Tendaguru Hill. These were described by Werner Janensch in 1929 but not named.Janensch, W., 1929, \\"Material und Formengehalt der Sauropoden in der Ausbeute der Tendaguru-Expedition\\", Palaeontographica (Suppl. 7) 2: 1-34 The finds were formally named by José Fernando Bonaparte, Wolf-Dieter Heinrich and Rupert Wild in 2000. The type species is Tendaguria tanzaniensis () Bonaparte, Heinrich & Wild 2000. The generic name refers to the Tendaguru, the area of the great German palaeontological expeditions between 1909 and 1912. The specific name was \\"after Tanzania, the country where the holotype was collected\\".J.F. Bonaparte, W.-D. Heinrich, and R. Wild, 2000, \\"Review of Janenschia Wild, with the description of a new sauropod from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania and a discussion on the systematic value of procoelous caudal vertebrae in the Sauropoda\\", Palaeontographica Abteilung A 256(1-3): 25-76 The territory of present Tanzania largely coincides with that of the former German East Africa. The type specimen consists of two syntypes, MB.R.2092.1 (NB4) and MB.R.2092.2 (NB5), probably uncovered in the Upper Saurian Bed (Obere Dinosauriermergel), Tendaguru Series, dating from the Late Jurassic Tithonian. The specimens are two anterior dorsal vertebrae, part of the collection of the Berlin's Natural History Museum. They probably belong to the same individual, having been found at a short distance from each other. Description Tendaguria was a large sauropod from the Tendaguru fossil locality. Its length is estimated at about twenty meters (sixty-six feet). The vertebrae are opisthocoelous (convex at the front, hollow behind) and differ from other known sauropods in their very low, almost non-existent neural spines, which are not distinct bodies of bone, do not rise above the surrounding area of the neural arch and are continuous at their rear with the transverse processes, including the epipophyses. Viewed from above, the spines have the form of a low and broad transverse ridge. Tendaguria is thus a highly derived or apomorphic sauropod; the axial musculature probably shifted from the neural spines to the dorsal surface of the transverse processes. Other autapomorphies are: a depression in the upper part of the outer side of each prezygapophysis; deep depressions in the front side of the transverse processes combined with shallow depressions in the rear side; the possession of robust epipophyses. Classification Due to its unique morphology, Tendaguria defied classification in the original description, where the authors placed it as Sauropoda incertae sedis, though also naming a separate Tendaguriidae. It shows a mix of basal and derived traits, indicating a position outside, respectively inside, Neosauropoda. A cervical vertebra referred to Tendaguria because of a similar low spine shows some similarities to Camarasaurus. In 2014 it was included in a cladogram generated in the redescription of Diamantinasaurus, where it was placed as the sister to Wintonotitan within Somphospondyli. Mannion (2019) and Mannion et al. (2019) assign Tendaguria to Turiasauria based on comparative anatomy.Philip D. Mannion (2019) A turiasaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Wealden Supergroup of the United Kingdom.

Traditionally, the breed was used for guarding sheep and goat herds, as well as to protect and for guard duty. It is a large breed of dog recognized by FCI as a Molossoid type dog breed of Soviet-era origin under Russian patronage.A.

Latifi: Breed overview in places of aboriginal habitat Some serve as livestock guardians, some protect their owners, and some are used for dog fighting, which is a national tradition in many countries of that region. This breed bears a strong genetic similarity to other aboriginal breeds of Livestock Guardian dogs from that region such as Georgian Shepherd (Nagazi), Kangal dog, and Akbash. Russian biologists and scientists have studied the local dog populationK. N. Plakhov and A. S. Plakhova: History of dog breeding in Southwestern Asia since the 18th century. After the Communist revolution, the Soviet government focused on working dog breeds for the Red Army, and imported the best breed representatives to Russia as per military dogs' and guard dogs' requirements. Over the decades, this practice harmed the local population. The introduction of new breeds to the region led to crossbreeding. Eventually, purebred dogs only remained with herders, breed enthusiasts and farms, with a surfeit of crosses elsewhere. However, the Central Asian Shepherd Dog population is still stable in general, reproducing some true quality dogs praised for working abilities, regardless of country of origin. Trading bloodlines and purchasing unrelated breeding stock between Russia, other \\"former USSR republics\\" (such as Ukraine, Belarus etc. ) and countries where CAO (Central Asian Ovtcharka) still at aboriginal stage is a common practice nowadays. This breed comprises numerous breed types. They differ in size, color, head types, and hair types. Central Asians tend to form a social group, consisting of different members bearing different duties; thus puppies with different working qualities are normally born in the same litter. These breed features, as well as different traditional names for the breed, give grounds for complications with breed standard. Most important, purebred Central Asians have unique breed characteristics.A. Vlasenko *Comments to the Central Asian Shepherd dog breed systematics Breed-specific dog anatomy includes exclusive features, such as very noticeable extremely flexible joints, false ribs, specific head set, and very strong neck with massive dewlap. Expressive, almost human eyes, revealing inimitable intelligence, finish the portrait. Early Central Asian Shepherd dogs For working qualities, modern Central Asians have been bred into different directions, depending on the demand for specific abilities. Traditional dog fighting had always been a national tradition in places of original habitat, but they had never been cruel and destructive as pitbull-type fights. All herders from the same area annually met together, and fought their strongest sheep guardian male dogs to pick the winner. It was about dominance rather than destroying their own kind. Most dogs evaluated each other when met at the field and the weaker or more submissive dog left, taking the loss. Dogs seldom injured each other, inflicting mostly minor scratches within a short period of time. Only true leaders actually had to determine the strongest dog via a real fight; but this was minor, compared to their everyday duties, facing predators and venomous snakes.Martin Jastrzębski Dog Fighting in Afghanistan - Tragedy or Tradition? cropped ears dog Modern commercial dog fights often differ from traditional as much as livestock guardian dogs differ from fighting dogs. There are different rules, and different breeds involved. Most Central Asians used for modern commercial fights come from fighting lines. The majority of breeders are aware of their dogs’ backgrounds, and will tell whether the dog comes from lines used for fighting. One can always expect a high level of aggression toward other dogs from CAOs with a dog fighting background. It is always important to distinguish whether a dog will display aggression only toward strange, unfriendly dogs entering their territory, while establishing and maintaining the usual social relationships with other animals on the premises; or will attack regardless of whether the other dog is a member of the same social group. Promiscuity in aggression toward strangers and friends is highly atypical for the breed. Central Asians are still in demand as livestock guardians, though not nearly as much as they used to be. These dogs, to differing degrees, are protective against human intruders; they are very territorial, safe with children; they love and respect elderly people, protect all small animals from predators, and are very gentle with family members.Holy Land for Volkodav Dogs for personal protection or working dogs originated from livestock guardian dogs, selectively bred by Russian breed experts for working abilities. As a result, they excel in obedience, territory protection, and personal protection, and are very intelligent. As such, they make perfect house dogs.E. Mychko, V Belen'kij *Prognosis of dog breeds well-being They do not need any complicated training to learn basic house rules, and treat the owner with the same great respect with which their ancestors treated the herder. These dogs were introduced to the worldwide sheep breeding community with great success. Guard dogs must be able to work as a team to protect sheep against predators; thus excessively aggressive CAOs, as with any other dogs, cannot be members of the pack, and will not pass this simple test for compliance with the breed origination purpose. Central Asian Shepherd dogs can come from working lines, fighting lines, and livestock guardian lines, and behave accordingly, regardless of the country they come from. Simple pedigree research and conversation with the breeder will reveal what basic instincts one can expect from the dog. Central Asians from pure show lines are very rare, because most registries require working tests prior to breeding.T. Ivanova *About Central Asian Ovtcharka (after visiting European Championship 2005) 2005 General appearance Central Asian Shepherd Dog. Young male Central Asian Shepherd in Turkmenistan This breed presents a robust dog of greater than average size with great strength and power. They are independent, curious and alert, yet imperturbable. The dog is as long as it is tall at the withers, or slightly longer than its height. The hair is short or moderately long with a heavy undercoat. Its ears are, in practice, cropped very short, and the tail is docked moderately long (except for dogs from countries where cosmetic surgeries for dogs are illegal). Most common colors are black/white; fawn of different shades, from almost white to deep red; brindle. Some have a black mask. The head is very solid, without pronounced stop or sculls. The neck is low set, short, with dewlap. The body is fairly broad, proportionate, muscles rather flat. The ribcage appears very long because of developed false ribs. The legs are straight, with heavy boning and moderate yet defined angulation. Leg bones must be in proportion, and shall never give the impression that any bone is short. The rump is broad. The typical gait is a gallop; however CAO can trot for hours without wearing themselves out.Svetlana Ermakova *\\"Sredneaziatskaya Ovtcharka\\"  Working requirements and tests  Central Asian Shepherd dog and litter of puppies The Central Asian is a working breed of dog, and different breed fanciers organizations issue sets or rules and recommendations important to preserve dogs’ abilities to perform certain duties. This includes special tests to determine a dog's inborn qualities, and training degrees or titles aimed to show what the dog can learn to do. The National Breed Club in Russia developed a temperament test to reveal a dog's willingness and ability to protect the premises, as well as titles in Obedience (such as OKD), and in Protection (such as ZKS or KS) for dogs in most pedigrees from Russia and other countries of that region. There are several other types of tests and training titles, from simple to extremely complicated. Breed Clubs in European countries seldom have requirements, while common dog sports such as Schutzhund or IPO are not perfectly suitable for a Livestock Guardian dog. Some European Union Countries developed special tests for large breeds of dogs aiming to reveal a dog's overall stability, such as The Mentality Assessment test in Sweden. Fight tests are common in countries where the breed is still in aboriginal stage, or in the process of formation. Despite adverse reputation of commercial dog fights, fight tests are aimed to reveal a dog's willingness and ability to fight predators. In countries with highly developed open field sheepherding, major livestock herd losses may be caused by predation from feral dogs and wolf-dog hybrids, and the livestock guardian dogs must be able to protect the sheep from those. The fight tests were established to maintain this important breed trait. And, finally, the real life test for the Central Asian is simply to be a farm dog, or herd protection dog, in any country. Information on Livestock Guardian dogs behavior and specifics can be found at Livestock Guardian Dog Association.  Classification  The CAO is a versatile, universal breed and fits under different descriptions at a time, what is a reason for different Kennel Clubs to classify Central Asians under different dog breed groups. RKF, a FCI- recognized Russian Kennel Club, classifies Central Asians as a working dog breed, reflecting tremendous results in obedience, protection and military- related training. Modern breeding requirements by the leading kennel club in Russia include mandatory temperament tests and training titles, besides show ratings. The UKC fits them together with other Flock Guardians of similar breeds, matching breeds’ natural sheep-guarding abilities, proven by breeders and farmers in the U.S.. The FCI classifies them as Molossoid dogs, sometimes described in different languages as Molossus- or Molosser-type dogs, likewise, reflecting the match by confirmation and common ancestry between the CAO and related breeds.

It is named in honor of the Tehuelche people, native to the Argentinian province of Chubut, where it was first found.  Description  It was a moderately large (possibly long) cetiosaur-like sauropod found in the Late Jurassic (Tithonian) Cañadon Calcareo Formation at Fernandez Estancia, Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina; known from the holotype MPEF-PV 1125 (Museo Paleontologico Egidio Fergulio), a 50% complete skeleton, lacking a skull, but including dorsal, sacral and caudal vertebrae, parts of the forelimbs and hindlimbs, parts of the shoulder girdle and pelvis, some rib fragments, and skin impressions. Tehuelchesaurus is most similar to Omeisaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China, but is distinguished by the shape of the coracoid, the stouter radius and ulna, and the shapes of the pubis and ischium; all the dorsal vertebrae have pseudopleurocoels (deep depressions in the centra but without internal chambers) and opisthocoelous centra, unlike in Barapasaurus and Patagosaurus. The length of the entire neck and tail are not known, but based on other proportions (humerus long; femur long; scapula long; ischium long; ilium ; pubis long), Tehuelchesaurus was probably about long. It was named by Rich, Vickers-Rich, Gimenez, Cuneo, Puerta & Vacca in 1999. The type species is Tehuelchesaurus benitezii (), named after Aldo Benitez, who discovered the holotype.

The new church located some distance further away would naturally become a sister church with the name of CHRIST THE KING (1982). The initiative of the erection of that new church complex was due to Fr. Scott (CICM)....\\" History=Construction The growing Roman Catholic community of Toa Payoh originally conducted their religious activities at the Ho Ping Centre and then at the Social Function Hall of the HDB East Area Office. The first mass was celebrated in the function hall on 6 April 1969. In June 1969, religious bodies in Singapore were invited by the Singapore Government to tender for a piece of land of . A month later, the government announced that a Roman Catholic church would be built at the junction of Toa Payoh Central and Lorong 4. The announcement sparked off a massive challenge of raising $450,000 for a church building, which fell on the shoulders of the late Rev Fr Pierre Abrial and Rev Fr Adrian Anthony. While contributions were forthcoming from benefactors and parishioners, Fr Abrial had to make personal visits to parishioners to ask for further donations, some of which were collected over 18 months instalments. By mid-June 1971, they were only some $30,000 short of the target. This shortage was eventually filled by the parishioners over the next few months. About two weeks later, the Church of the Risen Christ was officially opened on 3 July 1971 by Archbishop Michel Olcomendy. Originally, the Church was to be known as Church of the Resurrection, but was changed to Church of the Risen Christ as the former term was found to be rather abstract and impersonal. A quotation from the souvenir magazine published in conjunction with the Church's official opening cites the following rationale: > \\"The name RISEN CHRIST expresses in a better way the unique character of the > Easter event. We believe in a Risen Christ. We believe that He is alive and > that we have a relationship with God through Him. Our Church stands as a > permanent witness to such a faith\\". Expansion Situated in the centre of the new satellite town, Church of the Risen Christ was meant to serve a population of 200,000 middle and low- income flat owners. As Toa Payoh town estate grew in its affluence and size, so did the Church and its parish community. In an effort to reduce noise from the road traffic nearby, Church of the Risen Christ became among the first Roman Catholic Church to install an air-conditioning system within its premises in 1974. The grotto was later built in 1990 in honour of the Virgin Mary. Upon its completion, the grotto was blessed by Archbishop Gregory Yong on 15 August 1990, the Feast of the Assumption. The Grotto since became a place of devotions and prayers for individuals, families and church groups. The wooden shed and benches were added during the last renovation. One notable incident involving the church was a burglary on 17 May 1999 that resulted in the theft of $50,000 from the church's safe. This money consisted of the church's weekend collection, money for additional church expenses, and donations from a special religious celebration held on the Thursday prior to the burglary. As time went on by, space constraints posed a growing concern. Catechism classes for children were conducted in places like the sacristy and kitchen, thereby impeding on the priests' privacy and opportunity for interaction. Hence, the Church decided to build a new extension that would meet the needs of the growing community. Construction on the new 4-storey extension began in early 2003. Costing approximately $3.5 million, the new building houses the priest quarters and kitchen and contains 13 rooms that double up as classrooms and meeting rooms. Renovation At the same time, renovations within the church were carried out. The flight of stairs leading up to the Main Entrance was replaced by a new staircase with an extension built to house a youth room and an auditorium. A mural painting of Jesus preaching to a small crowd with the Lake Galilee in the background adorns the inner wall of the extension. To reduce renovation cost and time, layering of new floor tiles over existing ones was carried out. Small stained glass windows depicting the Passion of the Lord replaced the previous orange lanterns with illustrations of the scenes of the Passion. The old seating benches gave way to sturdy new ones, while the use of hymn books and bible leaflets were discontinued with the use of projectors and television screens displaying liturgical prayers, bible readings, hymns and announcements during mass. The church opened the new extension for viewing to the parishioners in November 2003.  Present-day  Due to redevelopment works at the Church of St Alphonsus (Novena Church), its Saturday Novena devotions are now conducted at Risen Christ. As at Novena Church, the devotion is conducted in English and Chinese, although the number of sessions has been reduced to six.

Organs The Parish houses 2 Allen Digital Pipe Organs, which forms the foundation of congregational worship in the Liturgy and choral accompaniment. The pipe organ is the instrument that is held in high esteem in the Roman Catholic Church for use in its liturgical celebrations. Musicam Sacram, which is a document issued by the Church on the use of music in the liturgy, states \\"The pipe organ is to be held in high esteem in the Latin Church, since it is its traditional instrument, the sound of which can add a wonderful splendor to the Church's ceremonies and powerfully lift up men's minds to God and higher things.\\" The organ has an integral place in liturgical music in the Church of the Risen Christ, and is the sole instrument that accompanies the congregation and choirs during the mass. The organ is also used together with other encouraged forms of liturgical music like choral polyphony and plainchant. It is hoped that this total experience of liturgical music will lead the faithful to a greater awareness of the divine in the liturgical celebrations, and help the faithful to truly sing the mass, and not just sing at mass. The Choir Loft Organ is a new one that was purchased in 2010 for use in Sunday masses and replaces an older Allen which served the church for a good 20 years. The new instrument is an Allen Quantum 2 manual and pedal instrument with 45 stops or voices. Other notable features include a set of 6 voicebanks which allow the entire organ's voices to be changed to sound like pipe organs built in different musical periods or countries. These include the American Classic, Cavaillé-Coll (French), Arp Schnitger (North German baroque), English Cathedral, Schlicker and Orchestral (pipe organ with orchestral sounds). The other Allen Organ was purchased in 1998 to replace the ageing organ in the Sanctuary used for weekday services. It is a small instrument with over 20 stops.

Accessed 20-09-11  Injury  Brito started Ivory Coast's third match against Tonga on 3 June. He caught a high ball that had been kicked up the field, and set off on a counter-attack. He was tackled by Inoke Afeaki, the Tonga flanker, before a ruck formed over him. The ruck collapsed and several players fell on top of Brito, leaving him prone and motionless on the ground. Brito was taken to the intensive care unit of the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria with broken vertebrae. Operations were carried out to stabilize the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but Brito was left paralysed below the neck. After the accident, Brito was given treatment and compensation, which was funded by all sides competing at the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Nevertheless, in 2007, it was reported that Brito was still largely unable to move, being bedridden most of the time, with only some limited movement in his chest and arms. He and his wife have separated, whilst he has little contact with his sons, and he now lives with his parents in Bordeaux. There has been some criticism of how his case was handled, after the initial support: Damian Hopley, Head of the Professional Rugby Players' Association, said in 2003, \\"We became involved in money-raising events for Max ... but there was very little support for him from Rugby World Cup.\\" In his 2007 interview, Brito was portrayed as living an unhappy life. He was quoted as saying: > \\"It is now 12 years since I have been in this state. I have come to the end > of my tether... If one day I fall seriously ill, and if I have the strength > and courage to take my own life, then I will do it...This bloody handicap - > it's my curse. It kills me and I will never accept it. I can't live with it > and it's going to be with me for the rest of my life.\\" But in 2020, in an interview with i, he revealed he had undergone a spiritual transformation that had helped him cope with his disability. > \\"I would say there were 13 or 14 years of fog where I didn't know where I > was. The accident was very violent. But after that I had a spiritual > enlightenment and I understood that it was necessary to accept my handicap. > And from that moment on, all the doors were open.\\"  References  Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Abidjan Category:People with tetraplegia Category:Ivorian rugby union players Category:Rugby union wings Category:Ivorian expatriate rugby union players Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France Category:Ivorian expatriate sportspeople in France ","title":"Max Brito"},{"id":"4431525","text":"Sherghati is a town in the Gaya district in Bihar (formally Magadha ) , India.

She made a great contribution to the development of anthroposophy, particularly in her work on the renewal of the performing arts (eurythmy, speech and drama), and the editing and publishing of Rudolf Steiner's literary estate. Life and work Marie von Sivers was born to an aristocratic family in Włocławek, Poland, then part of Imperial Russia. She was well-educated and was fluent in Russian, German, English, French and Italian. She studied theater and recitation with several teachers in Europe. Relationship to Rudolf Steiner Marie von Sivers \\"appeared one day\\" at one of Rudolf Steiner's early lectures in 1900. In the autumn of 1901, she posed the question to Steiner, \\"Would it be possible to create a spiritual movement based on European tradition and the impetus of Christ?\\" Rudolf Steiner later reported: > With this, I was given the opportunity to act in a way that I had only > previously imagined. The question had been put to me, and now, according to > spiritual laws, I could begin to answer it. Marie von Sivers collaborated with Steiner for the rest of Steiner's life and carried his work beyond his death in 1925 until her own death in 1948. She accompanied him and helped him as secretary, translator, editor, and organizer of his lecture tours and other public activities. She assisted Steiner's work with her own resources and in 1908 founded the Philosophical-Theosophical Press (later Philosophical-Anthroposophical) to publish Steiner's work. On 24 December 1914, von Sivers married Rudolf Steiner. Anna Eunicke Steiner, Steiner's first wife, had died in 1911. Beginning in 1914, Steiner drew up a succession of wills naming Marie Steiner-von Sivers as heir to his entire work and property and his successor in the leadership of the anthroposophical movement. Eurythmy and speech formation Starting in 1912, Rudolf Steiner developed the art of eurythmy. With Marie's guidance, it developed in three directions: as a stage art, as an integral part of Waldorf pedagogy, and as a therapeutic method. Under her tutelage, two schools of eurythmy were founded, in Berlin and in Dornach, Switzerland. Marie von Sivers, who had been trained in recitation and elocution, and made a study of purely artistic speaking. She gave introductory poetry recitals at Steiner's lectures and assisted him in the development of the four Mystery Dramas (1910–1913). With her help, Steiner conducted several speech and drama courses with the aim of raising these forms to the level of true art.

The genus is based solely on teeth. From 1968 Miguel Telles Antunes and Giuseppe Manuppella uncovered fossils at the Cerâmica do Mondego quarry near Taveiro, a village in Portugal, southwest of Coimbra. Among them were a number of low triangular teeth of a herbivorous dinosaur. In 1991 these were named and described by Telles Antunes and Denise Sigogneau-Russell as the type species Taveirosaurus costai. The generic name refers to Taveiro. The specific name honours the Portuguese geologist João Carrington da Costa.M. Telles Antunes & D. Sigogneau-Russell, 1991, \\"Nouvelles données sur les dinosaures du Crétacé supérieur du Portugal, Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences à Paris, Série II 313: 113-119 The holotype, CEGUNL-TV 10, was found in ancient river clay of the Argilas de Aveiro Formation dating from the Maastrichtian. It consists of one of the teeth. Nine other teeth were also assigned to the genus, CEGUNL-TV 6–9, 11 and 13–16. Later also some teeth found near Laño in Spain were referred. Having only the teeth to base themselves on, Telles Antunes and Sigogneau originally thought that Taveirosaurus belonged to some pachycephalosaurian group. In 1991 they assigned it to the Homalocephalidae, in 1992 to the Pachycephalosauridae.M. Telles Antunes & D. Sigogneau, 1992, \\"La faune des petits dinosaures du Crétacé terminal portugais\\", Comunicações dos Serviços Geológicos de Portugal 78(1): 49-62 However, they soon rejected this possibility — and Taveirosaurus has not been included in this group in recent reviews — in 1995 considering it a member of the Nodosauridae.M.

For about 20 years after its description, it was thought to be a basal ornithischian dinosaur, but better remains of other Triassic archosaurs have cast doubt on this interpretation. As named, it was a chimera of different animals. Description and history Technosaurus is based on TTUP P9021, which initially consisted of a premaxilla (tip of the upper jaw), two lower jaw pieces, a back vertebra, and an astragalus. Technosaurus and its type species, T. smalli, were named by Sankar Chatterjee in 1984. He described it as a fabrosaurid, a clade of small early ornithischians now considered to have been an artificial grouping. Material from the quarry where P9021 was found is disassociated and comes from a variety of Late Triassic animals, which would prove problematic. The genus was reviewed in 1991 by Paul Sereno, who interpreted the premaxilla and a fragment from the front of the lower jaw as pertaining to a hatchling prosauropod, and found the vertebra to be indeterminate and the astragalus an unidentifiable fragment. Thus, he restricted the remains to be considered Technosaurus to the second lower jaw piece, a posterior fragment. It was further reviewed in the light of new remains that spurred reevaluation of purported Triassic dinosaurs, particularly ornithischians named from tooth or jaw material. Irmis et al. (2007) agreed with the removal of the vertebra and astragalus, but found no characteristics that were unambiguously dinosaurian in the skull fragments. They noted similarities to Silesaurus in the jaw fragments Sereno had excluded, and themselves excluded the posterior fragment as actually belonging to the unusual rauisuchian Shuvosaurus. These authors would later restate their case, concluding that Technosaurus, defined only by the premaxilla and non-Shuvosaurus lower jaw fragment, was a valid, diagnostic genus, but could not be definitely classified beyond Archosauriformes incertae sedis, and was unlikely to be either an ornithischian or sauropodomorph dinosaur.

Fishersgate itself amounts in its mainland residential part to an outlying part of either that greater community, discounting its community church, or the east end of Southwick, having its football stadium much closer to the station than Southwick railway station for example. The east arm of Shoreham Harbour is metres from the English Channel here, separated by a breakwater spit with warehouses, storage/loading yards, affording some unobstructed views out to sea. The west extreme of the spit of land closer to Southwick has a small non-nuclear power station and a small sewage works bolstering local employment, and Fishersgate has a fuel depot and some dock buildings. History The station was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on 3 September 1905, and was originally named Fishersgate Halt. On 5 May 1969 it was renamed Fishersgate. There is step-free access to both platforms. The station is operated by Southern and is on the West Coastway Line. It has no ticket office, instead, a cash or credit card ticket machine.

In 1932 new longer platforms were constructed on an adjacent site nearer Hove to the previous platforms. They were renamed Aldrington Halt and later rebuilt in concrete by the Southern Railway. It is situated just east of the former junction with the branch line to Devil's Dyke, which opened in 1887 and closed in 1939; the layout and curvature of certain roads and buildings immediately north-west of the station indicates where the branch ran. The station was staffed during peak hours until approximately 1990, after which the hut which served as a ticket office was demolished. By 2009 the old concrete shelters had been replaced with reinforced plastic shelters which are now the only features on the platforms. Ramps lead down to street level. There are ticket-issuing machines at the entrances to each platform. Pre-purchased tickets can also be collected on these machines. There is no footbridge connecting the platforms with each other. However, there is a tunnel under the railway lines at the western end of the platforms which was originally built to allow the local farmer to move his cattle between fields which became separated with the arrival of the railway.

The popina was a place for plebeians of the lower classes of Roman society (slaves, freedmen, foreigners) to socialise and in Roman literature they were frequently associated with illegal and immoral behaviour. Features Popinae were a type of wine bar generally frequented by the lower-classes and slaves, and were simply furnished with stools and tables. They provided food, drink, sex and gambling. Because they were associated with gambling and prostitution, the popinae were seen by respectable Romans as places of crime and violence. Although gambling with dice was illegal, it would appear from the large number of dice found at cities like Pompeii that most people ignored this law. Several wall paintings from Pompeian popinae show men throwing dice from a dice shaker (see MANN 111482 Photo: Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli). Prostitutes frequented popinae, but as many of these wine bars found at Pompeii had no rooms provided with a bed, they must have met their customers at these bars then taken them elsewhere. The popina differs from the Roman caupona in that it did not provide overnight accommodation. Modern discovery Physical remains of taverns and bars are found in well-preserved Roman cities. 120 popinae were identified in Pompeii, but many of them might have been misidentified. Roman legislators could not actually do anything about what went on in taverns, but they could at least be seen to be trying. The taverns are often identified by evidence of storage jars set into them. However, regular shops also contained those storage jars. Some believed that the food and drink was sometimes catered when it was requested by a customer. Etymology The word is the Osco-Umbrian equivalent of Latin coquina, from Latin coquere \\"to cook\\".

Along with Amrita Pritam, Harbhajan is credited with revolutionising the Punjabi poetry writing style. He published 17 collections of poems, including Registan Vich Lakarhara, 19 works of literary history and translated 14 pieces of literature of others including those of Aristotle, Sophocles, Rabindranath Tagore and selections from the Rig Veda. Early life and education Harbhajan Singh was born in Lumding, Assam, on 18 August 1920 to Ganga Dei and Ganda Singh, his father, who was suffering from tuberculosis. The family had to move to Lahore where they bought two houses in Gawalmandi. His father died before he was one year old. Then his mother and two sisters died leaving him without a direct family by the time he was 4 years of age. He was brought up by his mother's younger sister who lived in Ichhra, Lahore. He was educated in the local DAV School and was a top student from a very early age. In his educational ventures, he was among the top three in Punjab but had to stop his studies for lack of money. He took up odd jobs as a sales-boy at a Homoepathic Chemist Shop in Lahore, as a lower- division clerk with the Government of India in New Delhi and then as an Assistant Librarian in Khalsa School, New Delhi. Singh completed his higher education without going to college, he had two degrees in English and Hindi Literature, both from the University of Delhi. His PhD thesis discussed Hindi poetry in the Gurumukhi script. One of his three sons Madan Gopal Singh is a well-known singer and scholar. Career He started his academic career as an English teacher before switching to Hindi and then to Punjabi. He worked at the University of Delhi as Professor Emeritus until he retired in 1984. He visited and gave lectures at many prestigious universities and institutions including the Indian Institute of Technology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Punjab University, Jammu University and Gauhati University. He was invited to join the Department of Modern Indian Languages by a Board of anthropologists and linguists, including Professor Pritam Singh, who Singh supported greatly until his death. Influences He praised Ustad Reham Din, Lala Suraj Bhan, Dr Mohan Singh Diwana, and Dr Nagendra as his most preferred teachers throughout his education.

Early life Berber was born in Bosanski Petrovac, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He trained at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana where he graduated with a BA and MA. In 1978, Berber received a teaching position at the Academy of Fine Arts in Sarajevo. Art Today Berber is one of the best known graphic artists in the world. He was included in the Tate Gallery collection in 1984. Throughout his career he created cycles of paintings which chronicle events, homages and dedications. Each cycle has its roots in Bosnian-Herzegovinian history from the medieval to the twentieth century. His works are characterised by the intermingling of ancient motifs with a more modern commentary, captivating in their iconic mystery and intensity. His surfaces are as complex as his subjects, combining techniques from various times and places while maintaining an aesthetic and allure that has drawn collectors for the past 40 years. Berber was occupied with painting, graphic art, tapestry, illustrating and preparing bibliographic editions, graphic and poetic maps. His scenography and costume design came to life in theatres in Ljubljana, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Washington. In 1985 Berber finished Tempo Secondo, his own animated cartoon. From 1992 until his death in October 2012 Berber resided and worked in both Zagreb and Dubrovnik. Awards From 1966 on Berber received more than fifty awards. Among many international prizes he received: * Gold Medal and Honorary Diploma at the First International Exhibition of Graphic Art in Trieste, * first award at the 11th International Biennale in São Paulo, * Honorary Prix at the 10th International Biennale of Graphic Art in Tokyo, * first award at the 7th Mediterranean Biennale in Alexandria, * ICOM award in Monte Carlo, * the Kraków City award at the 4th International Biennale of graphic art, and * the Lalit Kala Academy Grand Prix at the 5th Indian Triennale in New Delhi. Kraków Grand Prix in 1997, an Ostend exhibition entitled \\"Between earth and heaven\\" and a recent one \\"Artist of the ideal\\" in Verona, selected by famous art critic Edward Lucie-Smith, confirmed Berber as one of the most significant contemporary artists.

The five subfamilies, 54 genera, and over 2000 species are all evidently solitary, though many nest in aggregations. Two of the subfamilies, Euryglossinae and Hylaeinae, lack the external pollen-carrying apparatus (the scopa) that otherwise characterizes most bees, and instead carry the pollen in their crops. These groups, and most genera in this family, have liquid or semiliquid pollen masses on which the larvae develop. They can be found all over the world, but the most species live in South America and Australia. Over 50% of all bee species living in Australia belong to this family. Only the genera Colletes and Hylaeus can be found in Europe, while in North America, in addition to these two, the genera Caupolicana, Eulonchopria, and Ptiloglossa are found. Australian genera include Euhesma, a large genus, members of which has been split off into other genera such as Euryglossa and Callohesma. Traditionally, this family is believed to be likely the most \\"primitive\\" among extant bees, based primarily on the similarities of their mouthparts (the unique possession among bees of a bilobed glossa) to those of Crabronidae (the putative ancestors of bees), but recent molecular studies have disproved this hypothesis, placing the Melittidae (sensu lato) as the basal group of bees. \\"Nocturnal\\" species The Colletidae are one of the four bee families that contain some crepuscular species (of both the \\"vespertine\\" and \\"matinal\\" types). These bees, as is typical in such cases, have greatly enlarged ocelli. The other families with some crepuscular species are Andrenidae, Halictidae, and Apidae.

It was founded in 1982 by Elizabeth Moir and employs an English-medium curriculum. In 1998 the school was expanded by the new Chairman of the Board of Directors, Armyne Wirasinha, who created a new branch, Colombo International School Kandy, in Mawilmada.  History = Establishment  Colombo International School was established in 1982, shortly after Elizabeth Moir arrived in Sri Lanka. The school did not initially have a campus but instead operated out of various repurposed residential buildings and homes. Students were trained according to and to sit for the London Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations, before later transitioning to the Pearson Edexcel qualification. The school is officially registered as a company under the Companies Act of 1982, making its full registered name Colombo International School (Private) Ltd. It is therefore, like other international schools, not subject to many of the regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education, being instead subject to the authority of the Board of Investments.  Expansion  In 1993, the new chairman, Armyne Weerasinghe, initiated a development and expansion programme. In 1998, a new branch, CIS Kandy, was opened. The school has since expanded to reach the present enrollment of approximately 1600 students from over 30 countries.  Campus and facilities  The school is split into two branches. The main branch, situated on Gregory's Road, Colombo 7, admits approximately 1600 students per year, with an average of thirty students per class. The Kandy branch is located off Aluthgantota Road, Mawilmada, and admits approximately half that of the main branch: 700 students per year.  Main branch  The main branch campus lies next to the Sri Sambodhi Maha Viharaya, and is split in two by the Ven. Panadure Ariyadhamma Himi Mawatha, which connects the east-facing Gregory's Road to the south-east bound Wijerama Mawatha. The main campus is split into three sections: * Infant section :A three-storey building that houses the nursery, playgroup, pre- reception and reception classrooms, as well as those for the first and second grades. The third storey contains supplementary classrooms and computer laboratories reserved for use by the senior school. * Junior section :A five- storey building with the classrooms for the third through sixth grades. It also contains its own separate computer laboratory, art room and junior library. * Senior section :A collection of buildings containing general purpose classrooms as well as specialised laboratories for the sciences, art rooms, multimedia rooms and administrative and staff offices. The main senior building overlooks both a football field and a basketball court. * Auditorium complex :An appendage of the school's main campus, separated from it by the Ven. Panadure Ariyadhamma Himi Mawatha, containing two swimming pools, examination halls, supplementary classrooms and an auditorium for assemblies, staged productions and other functions.  Kandy branch  The Kandy branch is situated next to the Paranagantota Road. The campus houses facilities for sports such as netball, basketball and cricket, as well as those for the performing arts and yearly staged productions.  Notable events and controversies = Murder of Yvonne Jonsson  During the early hours of July 1, 2005, Yvonne Jonsson was murdered by fellow CIS alumnus Jude Shramantha Jayamaha in the stairwell of the Royal Park Condominium. Various news publications and the younger sister of the deceased alleged that Jayamaha had a history of illicit behaviour during his years at Colombo International School. This included receiving a suspension for the possession of narcotics on school grounds, as well as possibly impregnating another female student.  Sexual education textbook controversy  In 2010, UNP Member of Parliament and lawyer Dinesh Dodangoda lodged a complaint with the National Child Protection Authority against the use of the textbook, Introducing Moral Issues by Joe Jenkins, in the school's sixth and fifth grade curriculum. Dodangoda's complaint was followed by a probe against the school headed by the then chairwoman of the NCPA, Anoma Dissanayake. The complaint focused on the chapters concerning sexual education, namely the ones concerning contraceptives and sexual intercourse. The school initially refused to remove the book, with then principal M. J. Chappel justifying its use by stating that it had been in the syllabus since 1997 without complaint. The school consultant, D. C. Sanders, further went on to defend its use by stating that the contents of the book were not at all controversial by modern standards and were important to a relevant secondary education. Failing to bar the use of the book in the school's curriculum, Dodangoda went on to pursue legal action against the school, pursuant to which the Ministry of Education and the NCPA both performed their own investigations into the school.  Rainbow flag controversy  On September 19, 2018, according to a letter written by then Acting Principal Sarah Philipps, Saakya Rajawasan, a student at CIS, attended a rehearsal for the senior fashion show wearing a rainbow flag in support of the LGBT community, after previously having been told that the flag would not be tolerated. She was then subsequently barred from participation. On September 20, Rajaswaan attended school with the flag draped over her school bag. She refused to remove the flag after being confronted by the school's disciplinary officials. As a result, Rajaswaan received detention and was subject to other disciplinary action due to her actions, which were deemed 'unacceptable and irresponsible behaviour' by the acting principal. The events that transpired were reported on with special interest by the Colombo Telegraph, an online news publication that went on to release a series of articles in support of Rajawasan. On October 8, Saakya Rajawasan issued a public statement through bakamoono.lk in which she further went on to allege that she was denied an opportunity for prefectship for which she was otherwise sufficiently qualified, on the grounds that she chose to wear trousers instead of a skirt, which went against the school's uniform for girls.

He was an elder of the Popolzai Pashtun tribe in Oruzgan and a close ally of Hamid Karzai. Early years and personal life U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Anthony Przybysalwski with Khan in 2002. Khan was illiterate. During the war against the Soviets he served as a commander in the Jamiat-e Islami political party of Afghanistan led by Burhanuddin Rabani in Uruzgan. He later joined Jabha-i-Nijat Milli or National Salvation Front, another jihadi movement led by Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, and remained with the group until the victory of the mujaheddin. He lost an eye during the fighting and in later years gave differing accounts of how he sustained the injury. He was Oruzgan's governor for nearly four years under President Burhanuddin Rabani. Khan quit his job during the Taliban era and spent three years in a Kandahar jail on charges of working for former King Zahir Shah. Khan was a close friend of Karzai's father, Abdul Ahad Karzai, and was believed to mediate disputes among the Karzai brothers. In early 2002, Karzai appointed Khan as Oruzgan's governor, a position he held until March 2006. Khan was widely seen as incompetent, corrupt, closely tied to the opium poppy trade, and inclined to favor his own Populzai tribe at the expense of Oruzgan's other tribes. Thus no western governments objected when President Karzai replaced Khan as governor, giving him a nominal job in the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. In fact, Khan continued to meddle in Oruzgan's political affairs, often acting through his nephew, Matioolah Khan, a powerful and feared militia leader in the province. Khan had four wives, from whom he had a total of 18 daughters and 16 sons, the oldest of whom was born about 1981. A fifth wife died under mysterious circumstances amid rumors that Khan had her killed.  Governorship and dismissal  Major General Jason Kamiya in the U.S. armed forces presenting a gift to Khan in 2005. Khan was appointed governor of Orugzan province in 2002. He was replaced by Maulavi Abdul Hakim Munib (\\"Maulavi\\" is a title indicating religious training) on March 18, 2006. The Dutch military assumed control from the U.S. of the Provincial Reconstruction Team four months after Khan's departure. Khan returned to the province frequently in the ensuing years, meddling unhelpfully in local politics. The Dutch left Oruzgan in 2010, leaving the U.S. and Australia to continue the mission there. Assassination On July 17, 2011, gunmen stormed Khan's home in Kabul and killed him and MP Hasham Watanwal also of Oruzgan. Some sources report that his bodyguards were killed as well. The attack began with a small explosion and bursts of gunfire, according to eyewitnesses. While one attacker was killed, at least one other attacker blew himself up.http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Afghan-President-Hamid- Karzais-Senior-Adviser-Jan-Mohammad-Khan-Killed-In-Attack-At-Home-In- Kabul/Article/201107316032352?lpos=World_News_Top_Stories_Header_3&lid;=ARTICLE_16032352_Afghan_President_Hamid_Karzais_Senior_Adviser_Jan_Mohammad_Khan_Killed_In_Attack_At_Home_In_Kabul Some reports indicated a third attacker occupied Khan's home and were involved in an hours-long firefight with the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police. Afghan law enforcement had captured one attacker, who was carrying an AK-47 and a grenade launcher, while another attacker continued the firefight from a bathroom. SAS members of New Zealand were assisting and mentoring the Afghan security forces during the incident. The Taliban took responsibility for Khan's killing. They stated that Khan's killing was a punishment for all his deeds in the past, but members of the Afghan National Assembly accused Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Afghanistan often blames Pakistan's ISI for supporting \\"terrorist\\" attacks inside Afghanistan.Afghan, Pakistan presidents meet amid new tensions Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, the Interior Minister of Afghanistan, stated that the mobile phones recovered from the attackers showed incoming calls from Pakistan right before conducting the assassination.Khan's killers received calls from Pakistan: minister Others recall that Khan made many local enemies in southern Afghanistan over the years, within his own and competing tribes, and his death may have been the result of such a local feud.

Note that Sikkim was independent until 1975. The constitutional power to create new states and union territories in India is solely reserved to the Parliament of India. Parliament can do so by announcing new states/union territories, separating territory from an existing state or merging two or more states/union territories or parts of them. In addition to the existing twenty eight states and eight union territories, some new states and union territories of India have at various times been proposed to be established.http://www.walkthroughindia.com/walkthroughs/the-proposed-states- and-territories-of-india-from-the-different-regions/ History Before independence, India was divided into British-administered provinces and nominally autonomous princely states, which were governed by the British administration. After the partition of India, some of these administrative divisions became part of the Dominion of Pakistan, whilst the remaining states and provinces formed the Dominion of India. The colonial system of administration continued until 1956 when the States Reorganisation Act abolished the provinces and princely states in favour of new states which were based on language and ethnicity. Several new states and union territories have been created out of existing states since 1956. The Bombay Reorganisation Act split the Bombay State into the present-day states of Gujarat and Maharashtra on 1 May 1960 on a linguistic basis.J.C. Aggarwal and S.P.

Statehood was conferred upon Himachal Pradesh on 25 January 1971, and upon Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura on 21 January 1972. The Kingdom of Sikkim joined the Indian Union as a state on 26 April 1975. In 1987, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram became states on 20 February, followed by Goa on 30 May of the same year. Goa's northern exclaves of Daman and Diu became a separate union territory.Goa Chronology Three new states were created in November 2000: Chhattisgarh (1 November) was created out of eastern Madhya Pradesh; Uttaranchal (9 November), which was later renamed Uttarakhand, was created out of the mountainous districts of northwest Uttar Pradesh; and Jharkhand (15 November) was created out of the southern districts of Bihar. On 2 June 2014, Telangana was separated from Andhra Pradesh as the 29th state of the union. On 31 October 2019, Jammu and Kashmir state was split into two new Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. On 26 January 2020, the Union Territory of Daman and Diu and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli were merged into one Union Territory: the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. Andhra Pradesh=Rayalaseema Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh comprises four districts namely, Kurnool, Kadapa, Anantapur and Chittoor. On various occasions, there have been demand for the statehood of Rayalaseema. Grievances include lack of development, re-establishing Kurnool City as the capital and non-implementation of Sribagh Pact. Rayalaseema Parirakshana Samithi was formed by Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy in 2013 to champion the cause for a separate Rayalaseema state. There have also been demands to include two coastal districts of Prakasam and Nellore district to form Greater Rayalaseema. Assam Bodoland Map of Dimaraji state Bodoland The agitation for the creation of a separate Bodoland state resulted in an agreement between the Indian Government, the Assam state government and the Bodo Liberation Tigers Force. According to the agreement made on 10 February 2003, the Bodoland Territorial Council, an entity subordinate to the government of Assam, was created to govern four districts covering 3082 Bodo Kachari-majority villages in Assam. Elections to the council were held on 13 May 2003, and Hagrama Mohilary was sworn in as the chief of the 46-member council on 4 June. Karbi Anglong Karbi Anglong is one of the 35 districts of Assam. Karbi Anglong was previously known as Mikir Hills. It was part of the Excluded Areas and Partially Excluded Areas (the present North East India) in British India. The British Indian government had never included this area under their government's jurisdiction. Thereby, no government development work or activity were done, nor any tax levied from the hills including Karbi Anglong. The first memorandum for a Karbi homeland was presented to Governor Reid on 28 October 1940 by Semsonsing Ingti and Khorsing Terang at Mohongdijua.Dharamsing Teron, \\"Opium Curse – A Forgotten Chapter\\", unpublished.

Then again from 1986 through the leadership of Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC), demanded Autonomous statehood of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao under Article 244(A). In 2002, the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council passed another resolution to press for the demand of statehood. Several other memoranda were submitted at different times by several organisations. The demand for a separate state turned violent on 31 July 2013 when student demonstrators set government buildings on fire. Following the incident, the elected leaders of Karbi Anglong jointly submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister of India demanding a separate State. Dimaraji The Dimasa people of northeast India have been demanding a separate state called Dimaraji or \\"Dimaland\\" for several decades. It would comprise the Dimasa-Kachari inhabited areas, namely Dima Hasao district, Cachar district, parts of Barak Valley, Nagaon district, Hojai district and Karbi Anglong district in Assam together with part of Dimapur district in Nagaland.

There are six Maithili-speaking districts in Jharkhand: Deoghar, Dumka, Godda, Jamtara, Pakaur, and Sahebganj. There is no consensus on a proposed capital though Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Purnia and Begusarai have been suggested as candidate cities for the proposed capital. Delhi The nine districts of Delhi The political administration of Delhi more closely resembles that of a state than a union territory, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the Union government and the local government of Delhi. The previous National Democratic Alliance government introduced a bill in Parliament in 2003, to grant full statehood to Delhi, but the legislation was not passed. Gujarat=Bhilistan The establishment of Bhilistan has been a demand for over 30 years. The 1999 book Untouchable Dalits in Modern India by S. M. Michael reported the demand for Bhilistan. In 2012, The Times of India reported that the Bhilistan movement has been gaining ground in the tribal regions of Bharuch. The Daily News and Analysis reported in 2013 that the formation of Telangana state has reignited hopes for the demand of statehood to this region, comprising the tribal dominated parts of Gujarat and neighbouring states Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Kutch right Kutch State or Cutch State, covering Kutch district of Gujarat, Great Rann of Kutch and Little Rann of Kutch, is an aspirant, both as an independent state and as a combined Saurashtra. Saurashtra State (alias Kathiawar, uniting very many former princely states) and former Salute state Kutch State existed as separate states from 1947 to 1956. They were Part-B and Part-C states of India respectively. They were later merged with Bombay state following the States Reorganisation Act. They became part of Gujarat after the bifurcation of Bombay state on 1 May 1960 following the Mahagujarat Movement. Some people demand a return of statehood to Saurashtra and Kutch citing slow development of the regions. Apart from these two separate state-hood demands there is as demand for separate Bhilistan state. At the time of the integration of the princely state of Kutch with India in 1947, the accession was done on the condition that Kutch would retain the status of a separate state. It enjoyed this status till 1960, when a separate state of Gujarat was carved out of Maharashtra and Kutch was merged with it. The main reason behind a separate state is cultural and geographical distance from Gandhinagar. In 1960, Kutch was promised an autonomous development board under Article 371(2) of the Constitution, which never came into existence due to lack of political will. Water from river Narmada does not reach the farms of this region. Saurashtra Saurashtra region within Gujarat India The Saurashtra state movement for separate Saurashtra state was initiated in 1972 by advocate Ratilal Tanna, who was a close aide of former Prime Minister Morarji Desai. As per the Saurashtra Sankalan Samiti, more than 300 organisations across the Saurashtra region support the demand of the separate State. The Samiti also claims that compared to other parts of Gujarat, Saurashtra is underdeveloped. Lack of better water supply to the region, lack of job opportunities and subsequent youth migration have been cited as major reasons for the demand of statehood. Saurashtra is linguistically different from the rest of the state with its Saurashtra dialect being in use. Saurashtra-Kutch Alternatively, a joint state for both Kutch and Saurashtra is advocated. Jammu and Kashmir Map showing the Kashmir valley and Jammu region Jammu state and Kashmir state Ethnic Kashmiri leaders, including writer and opinion leader Ghulam Nabi Khayal, have called for the division of Jammu and Kashmir into separate states as a possible solution to the Kashmir conflict. The proposed state of Kashmir comprises the Kashmir valley region and the proposed state of Jammu comprises the Jammu region. The Jammu region is geographically separate from the Kashmir valley. It is inhabited by Dogras, Gujjars and Sikhs who speak the Dogri, Gojri, Punjabi languages. Panun Kashmir Panun Kashmir is a superficial proposed union territory in the Kashmir Valley which is advocated by the Kashmiri Pandit Network as a homeland for Kashmiri Hindus who have fled the Kashmir valley as a result of ongoing violence and hope to return.http://www.panunkashmir.org/ Karnataka=Tulu Nadu Map of Tulu Nadu and Kodava Tulu Nadu is a border region between the states of Karnataka and Kerala in southern India. The demand for a separate state is based on a distinct culture and language (Tulu, which does not have official status), and neglect of the region by the two state governments. To counter these demands and accusations, the Karnataka and Kerala state governments have created the Tulu Sahitya Academy to preserve and promote Tuluva culture. The proposed state would comprise three existing districts; Dakshina Kannada and Udupi from Karnataka, and Kasaragod district from Kerala. Konkan Konkan is a rugged section of the western coastline of India. It consists of the coastal districts of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. The ancient sapta-Konkan is a slightly larger region described in the Sahyadrikhanda which refers to it as \\"Parashuramakshetra\\". The proposed Konkan state includes the districts of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg of Maharashtra, north and south districts of Goa and Karwar up to Aghanashini in Karnataka.http://news.oneindia.in/2006/09/29/agri-kunbi-sena-demand-separate- konkan-state-1159553012.html OneIndia News. 29 September 2006 Kodagu Kodagu district of Karnataka. This state/union territory can be named as Kodava Land. Karu Nadu right North Karnataka (unofficially known as Karu Nadu) is a geographical region consisting of mostly semi-arid plateau from elevation that constitutes the northern part of the Karnataka state in India. It is drained by the Krishna River and its tributaries the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra. North Karnataka lies within the Deccan thorn scrub forests ecoregion, which extends north into eastern Maharashtra. It includes the districts of Belgaum, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Bidar, Bellary, Gulbarga, Yadagiri, Raichur, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri and Koppal district. Major cities in the region are Belgaum, Hubballi, Dharwad, Bellary, Bijapur, Gadag, Ranebennur, Koppal, Gangavati, Sindhanur, Raichur, Yadagiri, Hospet, Bagalkot, Kalaburgi, Bidar Haveri, and Gokak. Madhya Pradesh Madhya Pradesh is the second largest by area and holds nearly 9.37% of land area of country. It also has approximately 10% of India's population. The regions of Madhya Pradesh are ethno-linguistically very different and find no connect to each other. Hence there has been a constant demand to divide the state into smaller states with homogenous population Baghelkhand, Bundelkhand and Vindhya Pradesh The former state of Vindhya Pradesh Vindhya Pradesh is a former state of India. It occupied an area of 23,603 sq. miles. It was created in 1948, shortly after the independence of India, from the territories of the princely states in the eastern portion of the former Central India Agency. It was named for the Vindhya Range, which runs through the center of the province. The capital of the state was Rewa. It lay between Uttar Pradesh to the north and Madhya Pradesh to the south, and the enclave of Datia, which lay a short distance to the west, was surrounded by the state of Madhya Bharat. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956, following the States Reorganisation Act. In 2000, Sriniwas Tiwari, ex-speaker of the Madhya Pradesh assembly, called for nine districts to be separated from Madhya Pradesh to create a new state of Vindhya Pradesh, although this was rejected by the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. Separate Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand states instead of a single Vindhya Pradesh is advocated as well to accommodate the districts claimed by these regions from neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh. Gondwana and Mahakoshal Mahakoshal is a region which lies in the upper or eastern reaches of the Narmada River valley in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Cities and districts of the region include Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Katni, Narsinghpur, Mandla, Dindori, and Seoni. The largest city and a possible capital is Jabalpur. Organisations such as Mahakaushal Mukti Morcha and Bharatiya Janashakti have demanded separate statehood for the region. It is alleged that though the Mahakoshal region is rich in minerals, forests, water and land resources, related industries were set up in nearby states. Also, the region has a distinct cultural identity owing to Jabalpur city, known as the Sanskardhani (cultural capital) of the State, one of the oldest towns of central India. Culturally and socially, the Mahakoshal region differs greatly from the neighbouring Vindhya Pradesh. One of the key reasons for this is said to be that large parts of Mahakoshal were under direct British rule from the nineteenth century onwards, turning it into a relatively progressive, modern and liberal area and infusing democratic values into its body politic. Casteism and feudalism are said to be not as deeply rooted in this region as they are in Vindhya Pradesh.http://freepressjournal.in/mahakaushal-no- cakewalk-for-either-contender/ A parallel demand for a state of Gondwana from the same Mahakoshal region of Madhya Pradesh has arisen owing to the fact that vast areas of Mahakoshal were ruled by Gond kings and even today, Mandla, Chinndwara, Dindori, Seoni and Balaghat have a predominantly Gond tribal population. Tribals constitute 64 per cent of the total population of Dindori district. For Mandla, the corresponding figure is 57 per cent. The Gondwana Gantantra party (GGP) was established in 1991, with the objective to struggle for the creation of a separate Gondwana State comprising regions that were ruled by Gonds. The Gondwana Gantantra party (GGP) has since divided into numerous factions such as Rashtriya Gondwana party and Gondwana Mukti Dal. Malwa There have been demands for a separate Malwa state with the probable capital at Indore. The region includes the Madhya Pradesh districts of Agar, Dewas, Dhar, Indore, Jhabua, Mandsaur, Neemuch, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Shajapur, Ujjain, and parts of Guna district and Sehore, and the Rajasthan districts of Jhalawar and parts of Banswara and Pratapgarh. The main language of Malwa is Malvi, although Hindi is widely spoken in the cities. This Indo- European language is subclassified as Indic. The language is sometimes referred to as Malavi or Ujjaini. Malvi is part of the Rajasthani branch of languages; Nimadi is spoken in the Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan. The dialects of Malvi are, in alphabetical order, Bachadi, Bhoyari, Dholewari, Hoshangabadi, Jamral, Katiyai, Malvi Proper, Patvi, Rangari, Rangri and Sondwari. A survey in 2001 found only four dialects: Ujjaini (in the districts of Ujjain, Indore, Dewas and Sehore), Rajawari (Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch), Umadwari (Rajgarh) and Sondhwari (Jhalawar, in Rajasthan). About 55% of the population of Malwa can converse in and about 40% of the population is literate in Hindi, the official language of the Madhya Pradesh state. Rewakhand An initiative has been started by MP High Court Bar council with a demand of a new state of \\"Rewakhand\\" from the eastern half of the state combining all the regions of Vindhya Pradesh, Bundelkhand, Baghelkhand and Mahakoshal Maharashtra=Khandesh Khandesh is a region of central India, which forms the northwestern portion of Maharashtra state. Khandesh was the region demarcated as a boundary after which Dakkhan a.k.a. Deccan started. The Khandesh state was founded and ruled by the Faruqi dynasty with its capital at Burhanpur (now in Madhya Pradesh). The state covered the area of the today's Jalgaon, Dhule, Nandurbar districts of Maharashtra state and Burhanpur district of Madhya Pradesh state. The terms \\"Khandesh\\" and \\"Deccan\\" thus connote historical and political affiliations, as well as geographical zones. Khandesh lies on the Northwestern corner of the Deccan plateau, in the valley of the Tapi River, and is bound to the north by the Satpura Range, to the east by the Berar (Vidarbha) region, to the south by the Hills of Ajanta, belonging to the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, and to the west by the northernmost ranges of the Western Ghats, and beyond them the coastal plain of Gujarat. After India's independence in 1947, Bombay province became Bombay state, which in 1960 was divided into the linguistic states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. During the formation of the State of India, Burhanpur became the part of the state of Madhya Pradesh, and in 1960, East Khandesh became Jalgaon district, and West Khandesh became Dhule of the Maharashtra State. Konkan Konkan is a rugged section of the western coastline of India. It consists of the coastal districts of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. The ancient sapta-Konkan is a slightly larger region described in the Sahyadrikhanda which refers to it as \\"Parashuramakshetra\\". The proposed Konkan state includes the districts of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg of Maharashtra, north and south districts of Goa and Karwar up to Aghanashini in Karnataka. Marathwada Marathwada is one of the five regions in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The region coincides with the Aurangabad Division of Maharashtra. Marathwada came under the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad, which later became the princely state of Hyderabad, under the suzerainty of British India. Subsequently, through Operation Polo, a \\"police action\\" on 17 September 1948, the Indian army annexed Hyderabad to India and on 1 November 1956, Marathwada was transferred from Hyderabad State to Bombay State. On 1 May 1960, Bombay state was divided into Maharashtra and Gujarat states, Marathwada becoming a part of the former. Vidarbha Vidarbha is a region that comprises the Amravati and Nagpur divisions of eastern Maharashtra. The State Reorganisation Act of 1956 placed Vidarbha in Bombay State. Shortly after this, the States Reorganisation Commission recommended the creation of Vidarbha state with Nagpur as the capital, but instead it was included in Maharashtra state, which was formed on 1 May 1960. Support for a separate state of Vidarbha had been expressed by Loknayak Bapuji Aney and Brijlal Biyani Vidarbha. The demand for the creation of a separate state are based on allegations of neglect by the Maharashtra state government. Jambuwantrao Dhote led a popular struggle for Vidarbha statehood in the 1970s. Two politicians, N. K. P. Salve and Vasant Sathe, have led attempts to bring about a state of Vidarbha in recent times. Mumbai Mumbai is the Financial Capital of India i.e. Bharat. For Global Benchmark Development Mumbaikars' continuous demand for Union Territory status for Mumbai. Pune the possible Capital of Maharashtra State. Meghalaya North Eastern autonomous divisions Garoland Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC) is seated at Tura and covers East Garo Hills district, West Garo Hills district, South Garo Hills District, North Garo Hills District and South West Garo Hills District is one of the three Autonomous District Councils within Meghalaya state, and one of fourteen autonomous regions of India. The Garo National Council is a political party in Meghalaya in northeastern India. Founded by Clifford R. Marak, the party fights for the creation a new state Garoland of a Garo-majority state, to be carved out of three districts of Meghalaya, West Garo Hills, East Garo Hills, and South Garo Hills. The Garoland demand of GNC is different from that of the separatist guerrilla Achik National Volunteer Council. ANVC also demands that parts of Assam ought to be part of Garoland. GNC won one seat in the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council elections in 2002. In the state assembly elections in Meghalaya of 2003, GNC had put up seven candidates, whom together received 8,483 votes. Clifford Marak, the only GNC MLA in the state legislature, died on 1 March 2015 of liver and kidney disease. Odisha=Hirakhand Demand for a separate Hirakhand province, comprising the British Sambalpur district and princely states in Orissa, was raised for the first time in the year 1946, opposing the construction of Hirakud dam in Sambalpur.Page 53, Challenges – Reminiscences of a Distinguished Indian Police Officer, by Srikanta Ghosh, 1967 The whole of Western Odisha and part of Chhattisgarh state, mainly the Sambalpuri speaking areas comes under its territory. In order to popularise the movement published 'Hirakhand Samachar', a weekly periodical and the second issue of this publication dated August, 1946, published an article sponsoring the separation and formation of 'Hirakhand province' which was altered as 'Kosala province' in subsequent stage of the agitation.Page 54, Challenges – Reminiscences of a Distinguished Indian Police Officer, by Srikanta Ghosh, 1967 The Patna darbar (in Balangir) had involved itself directly in the Hirakud agitation of Sambalpur in order to push up its Hirakhand or Kosala movement.Page 149, Beginning of the End by Dr Harekrushna Mahatab, 1949 Prominent Congress politicians of Western Orissa then, like Bodhuram Dube and Laxminarayan Mishra made a common cause by supporting the idea of secession of Hirakhand from Orissa.Page 206, The Indian Historical review, Vol. 29/ Indian Council of Historical Research After construction of the Hirakud dam on the river Mahanadi, thousands of people were forcefully displaced from their ancestral land without giving proper compensation or rehabilitation package. This caused thousands of families losing their livelihood. In such situation the demand for creation of separate province of Hirakhand died an untimely death. Post independence, the demand for creation of separate Hirakhand has been raised time and again by several organisations and politicians. As education and awareness is growing among West Odisha people, the separatist movement's support and power are increasing. Kosal The Kosal region is the entire Western Odisha area located in Odisha state, between 19° 37'- 23° N latitude and 82° 28'- 85° 22' E longitudes comprising the districts of Sundargarh, Jharsuguda, Debagarh, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Sonepur, Boudh, Bolangir, Nuapada, Nabarangpur, Aathmallik sub-division of Angul district and Kashipur block of Rayagada district. It is surrounded by Jharkhand state on the north, on the east by the dist of Keonjhar, Angul and Kandhamal; on the south by Rayagada, Kalahandia, Koraput and on the west by Chhattisgarh state. This geographical area comes under the Western Odisha Development Council. Kalinga State The Kalinga region is the entire Southern Odisha area located in Odisha state. Rarhbhumi Bihar and Orissa province Rarhbhumi is also another aspirant state in Odisha. Rarhbhumi comprised the northern part of Odisha with Jharkhand's Kolhan division, Danbad district and Eastern half of Bokaro district of North Chotanagpur division and Santhal Pargana division. Northern Odisha's districts which was a part of British Bengal presidency and after British Bihar and Orissa province. Tamil Nadu=Kongu Nadu Kongu Nadu proposed state Kongu Nadu is a region comprising the western part of Tamil Nadu. In the ancient Tamilakam, it was the seat of the Chera kings, bounded on the east by Tondai Nadu, on the south-east by Chola Nadu and on the south by Pandya Nadu regions. The region was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. The Kosar people mentioned in the second century CE Tamil epic Silappathikaram and other poems in Sangam literature is associated with the Coimbatore region. The region was located along an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu. The Gangas of Thalakkad ruled it for over five centuries. The medieval Cholas conquered the region in the 10th century CE. It came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire by the 15th century. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijayanagara Empire established their state as an independent kingdom. In the latter part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore, following a series of wars with the Madurai Nayak dynasty. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed Kongu Nadu to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The region played a significant role in the Indian independence movement. Palani is the important religious centre in Kongu Nadu region. Coimbatore is the largest city in Kongu Nadu and has been proposed as a capital for the region. Tripura=Tipraland Tipraland is the name of a proposed state in India. The formation of \\"Tipraland\\", a state within the TTAADC, under articles 2 and 3 of the Indian Constitution is demanded by the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) as one of their political agenda. Another registered regional political party Tipraland State Party (TSP) also demanding the same demand of Tipraland. The Kingdom of Tripura is a former country which was ruled by 184 Tripuri/Tipra kings. The first king of the Manikya Dynasty of Tripura was Maha Manikya, who ruled the kingdom in the early 15th century. The earlier kings are partly mythological and partly legendary or semi-legendary. The second last king was Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman Manikya Bahadur. After his death in 1947, Tipra kingdom joined India as a C-Model State on 15 October 1949 under the name Tripura, and later achieved statehood on 21 January 1972. Historically, the Kirati Tripuri converted Hindu rulers of Tripura's Manikya dynasty had always encouraged the immigration of and settlement of non-tribals, especially Bengalis to Tripura. Rajmala authenticates the fact that Ratna Manikya (1464-1468) was the first to 'settle 4000 Bengalis in four places' in Tripura. During Noakhali riots in 1946 many Bengali Hindu survivors referred to as East Bengali Refugees were sheltered in temporary relief camps in Comilla, Chandpur, Agartala the present capital of Tripura and other places. A large migration of Bengali Hindus and Muslims took place in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and other places during Bangladesh Liberation War on 1971. The indigenous Tipra people demanded an autonomous district, which they finally achieved on 23 March 1979 which is known as Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC). The politically important TTAADC constitutes two-thirds of Tripura's 10,491 km2 area, which has 12,16,465 (mostly tribals) of the state's 37 lakh population residing in it. Tribal Welfare Department (Government of Tripura) strictly monitoring the implementation of the Tripura Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Reservation Act, 1991 (As amended up to February, 2006) for departmental promotion / direct recruitment in all Government Departments / PSUs and local bodies. For admission in schools / colleges, allotment of seats in Medical / Engineering and other Technical and General Courses, 31% reservation for ST is strictly followed. Schedule Tribes in Tripura are exempted from income tax. Uttar Pradesh Current regions of UP Proposed states in UP At least four states have been proposed to be carved out of Uttar Pradesh. Awadh Pradesh The population of proposed Awadh state, consisting of Awadhi speaking districts of central Uttar Pradesh, would be approximately 50 million people with an area of approximately 75,000 km2 and Lucknow as the capital. Braj Pradesh and Harit Pradesh/Pashchim Pradesh/Uttam Pradesh Harit Pradesh is a proposed state, which would comprise 22 districts of Western Uttar Pradesh, currently forming six divisions – Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Meerut, Moradabad, Saharanpur and some parts of the Kanpur Division, (Farrukhabad, Etawah and Auraiya districts). The most prominent advocate for the creation of the new state is Ajit Singh, the leader of the Rashtriya Lok Dal party. Mayawati also supported the formation of Harit Pradesh in December 2009. There is another demand within the same region – Braj Pradesh, consisting of Agra division, Aligarh division and some districts of the Kanpur division (Farrukhabad, Etawah and Auraiya) from Uttar Pradesh, and the districts of Bharatpur and Gwalior from Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The proposed capital would be in Agra.'Braj Pradesh' State Demand Intensifies – Indiaserver.com So far, Braj has remained as a historical and cultural region, rather than a political entity. The language of Braj is Braj Bhasha. Bundelkhand Bundelkhand across UP & MP Bundelkhand comprises parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. In 2011, the Bahujan Samaj Party government under Chief Minister Mayawati proposed the creation of Bundelkhand from seven districts of Uttar Pradesh. Organisations such as Bundelkhand Mukti Morcha (BMM) also demanded for its formulation, along with inclusion of six other districts from Madhya Pradesh as well. Uma Bharati of the Bharatiya Janata Party promised a separate state of Bundelkhand within three years if her party was voted to power, during campaigning for the 2014 Loksabha Elections at Jhansi. A similar promise was made by Congress leader Pradeep Jain Aditya during these elections. Since the early 1960s there has been a movement for establishing a Bundelkhand state for promoting development of the region. Bundelkhand is geographically the central part of India covering part of Madhya Pradesh and part of Uttar Pradesh. Despite being rich in minerals, the people of Bundelkhand are poor and the region is underdeveloped and underrepresented in state and central politics.http://daily.bhaskar.com/news/MP-BHO-demand-for-seperate-bundelkhand- reignited-ahead-of-assembly-polls-4226793-NOR.html Agrarian crisis and farmer's suicides is also cited as reason for separate statehood.http://www.epw.in/states/farmers-suicides-and-statehood-demand- bundelkhand.html Purvanchal Purvanchal Purvanchal is a geographic region of north-central India, which comprises the eastern end of Uttar Pradesh state. It is bounded by Nepal to the north, Bihar state to the east, Baghelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh state to the south, the Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh to the west. Purvanchal comprises three divisions – Awadhi region in the west, Bhojpuri region in the east and the Baghelkhand region in the south. The most commonly spoken language in Purvanchal is Bhojpuri. Purvanchal area is represented by 23 Members of Parliament to the lower house of Indian Parliament, and 117 legislators in the 403 member Uttar Pradesh state assembly or Vidhan Sabha. Districts-Azamgarh, Ballia, Chandauli, Deoria, Ghazipur, Gorakhpur, Jaunpur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Mau, Mirzapur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Sant Ravidas Nagar, Siddharth Nagar, and Varanasi. As a fallout of the movement for Telangana, then state chief minister Mayawati, proposed on 13 December 2009, to carve out a separate state of Purvanchal out of Uttar Pradesh with either Allahabad or Varanasi as its capital. West Bengal=Gorkhaland Proposed Gorkhaland state Gorkhaland is a proposed state covering areas inhabited by the ethnic Gorkha (Nepali) people, namely Darjeeling hills and Dooars in the northern part of West Bengal.Sailen Debnath, The Dooars in Historical Transition, The movement for Gorkhaland has gained momentum in the line of ethno-linguistic-cultural sentiment of the people who desire to identify themselves as Gorkha. The demand for a separate administrative region has existed since 1907, when the Hillmen's Association of Darjeeling submitted a memorandum to the Morley-Minto reforms committee. After Indian independence, the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL) was the first political party from the region to demand greater identity for the Gorkha ethnic group and economic freedom for the community. In 1980, the Pranta Parishad of Darjeeling wrote to the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, with the need to form a state for the Gorkhas. The movement for a separate state of Gorkhaland gained serious momentum during the 1980s, when a violent agitation was carried out by Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) led by Subhash Ghising. The agitation ultimately led to the establishment of a semiautonomous body in 1988 called the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) to govern certain areas of Darjeeling district. However, in 2008, a new party called the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) raised the demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland once again. In 2011, GJM signed an agreement with the state and central governments for the formation of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, a semiautonomous body that replaced the DGHC in the Darjeeling hills. Kamtapur Kamtapur lies in the northern parts of West Bengal. The proposed state consists of the districts of Koch Behar, Jalpaiguri, and southern plains of Darjeeling, including Siliguri city. Smaller proposals Mahe district is one of the four districts of Puducherry, lying completely opposite to Pondicherry on Kerala coast. It is argued by many advocating the adjoining of Mahe with Lakshadweep or Kerala or make a separate union territory because of a perceived lack of development compared to the rest of Puducherry. The merger of Yanam with Andhra view remoteness to Puducherry as it is located near to Kakinada port of Andhra Pradesh is also advocated.

Early life  The 1901 census shows that Anthony William Hall was born in Chiswick, Middlesex in 1898 to Ambrose and Mary Hall. At that point, he had three brothers and one sister. Both his mother and his eldest brother were born in New Zealand. The family were living in the parish of Little Dewchurch in Herefordshire. In the 1911 census, the family had moved to Chetnole in Dorset, where Anthony lived with his parents, his sister Mary and his eldest brother Humphrey, who was described as \\"feeble-minded\\". The census also reveals that his father was a retired master mariner. Anthony married Ethel Brazier in Shropshire during the second quarter of 1923. Hall joined the Shropshire Constabulary after World War I as Police Constable 168. He was praised as a \\"first-class\\" photographer, shorthand-writer and typist, with a good working knowledge of fingerprinting. He was promoted to Police Inspector at the age of 28 but abruptly resigned after a disagreement with his Chief Constable, in 1927. He moved to Canada that year, where he broke up with his wife, who returned to the UK in December. He remained in Canada until April 1929. During the next decade, he lived in the city of Hereford and then London.  Claims to the English throne = Background  Anthony William Hall claimed to be the direct male descendant of Henry VIII, the 11th in the line. According to his story, the line was founded by John Hall, a son of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, who was born prior to the King's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Since Anne was not more than nine years old, possibly less, and since the English Crown does not descend to illegitimate children, the claim was ludicrous. At the same time as Hall was declaring his lineage, there was also a Jacobite pretender to the throne, Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, as well as several others for monarchies on the European mainland.  Actions  In 1931, Hall attempted — in an \\"open letter\\", in the form of a pamphlet, to King George V, whom he addressed as \\"George Frederick Ernest Albert Windsor (alias Guelph)\\" — to claim the English throne. He also made many speeches, in Birmingham and elsewhere, in which he set out his claim and challenged the King to a duel, with the loser to be beheaded. He also set forth an agenda to deal with the national debt, for the dissolution of the Government of the United Kingdom, and the abolition of income tax. One of his more popular pledges was to increase the alcoholic strength of beer. These claims were eventually raised with King George V, as records released in 2006 showed that the monarch had discussed this with the Private Secretary to the Sovereign, Sir Clive Wigram. In those notes, Wigram wrote in 1931, \\"His Majesty quite agrees that a stop should be put to his effusions but feels that it might not look very well for a man who is obviously demented to get six months imprisonment. Would it not be possible to keep him under observation with a view to his final detention in an institution, without actually putting him in prison.\\" Despite this request, Sir John Anderson at the Home Office decided that he was \\"not so obviously demented or insane that he could be dealt with without recourse to court proceedings.\\" Hall was said to have addressed over 1,000 meetings in a six-year period. He was arrested many times for using \\"scandalous language\\", and was fined and bound over to keep the peace. For example, in 1936 he appeared before a city magistrates' court in Hereford after attempting to hold a public meeting in St Peter's Square, charged with obstructing the free passage of the square, assaulting a local police inspector who intervened, and conducting himself \\"in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace\\". He declared in the court that he would make Hereford his capital city and that he would establish royal mints \\"in every city in the country\\". When he was fined £20 he initially refused to pay, protesting that as their \\"lawful king\\" they could not demand it. In London, which he pledged to rebuild to house 100 million peopleThe actual population of London peaked at 8 million in 1939, pre-World War II. and where he served eviction notices to the King at Buckingham Palace, he was known to declare his claims loudly up to five times a day in the areas around Tower Hill and near the Woolwich Dockyard. He also moved around the country to proclaim his claim, and sold slips of paper which he said would be the new currency once he ascended to the throne. In July 1937, he was fined £1 for selling those pamphlets in Southend, and during the court case he declared that his name was also Anthony Tudor. During his incarcerations, he was reviewed by two prison doctors who could not find evidence of any insanity, while one, Dr Hamblin Smith, said that Hall's ideas for resolving the national debt were not insane.  Later life  In 1939, divorce proceedings were brought against him by his wife. During the court hearing, he conducted his own case and questioned his wife for more than six hours. In summing up, the judge said of Mr Hall, \\"He appears to be a man of tempestuous, undisciplined and erratic disposition. I have not formed the opinion that he is in any way a wholly bad man. He appears capable of generous and excellent impulses, but against that he is completely reckless in his actions.\\" Mrs Hall was given a decree nisi plus costs, and full custody of their child. During the Second World War, he contested with his sister, Mary Hall, over his mother's house in Little Dewchurch. He had taken possession of the property and she was seeking to have him removed. His defence in the matter was that the Probate Act of 1857, although signed by Queen Victoria, had never reached Royal Assent and was therefore invalid to be used in a court of law. He declared that he was going to take the issue to the House of Lords. Instead, Judge Roope Reeve ruled against his case, and granted possession of the property to his sister in 28 days, but allowed him the following 14 days to make an appeal. Hall died in Little Dewchurch in December 1947. Following his death, he was still referenced as a Pretender to the British throne as late as 1950.

(Whaddaya lookin' at?!).  Early life  He was born to Turkish immigrants from Antakya.Interview mit Kaya Yanar, TV Direkt (in German, archived version from 2010). \\"My parents are Turks, have a Turkish passport and lived in the southernmost city of Turkey: Antakya. ... I have occasionally told that my parents know Arabic. That is how this description of being \\"half Turkish, half Arab\\" arose. I am a German with Turkish roots, whose parents know Arabic. That is the best way to describe the situation.\\" While at school he once told his teacher that he wanted to be a comedian, which made the teacher laugh. In an interview with German talkshow host Johannes B. Kerner Yanar described his childhood as a more liberal one and stated that despite his Turkish nationality, he doesn't have a perfect grasp of the Turkish language. After graduating from Heinrich-von-Gagern-Gymnasium (a school in Frankfurt) he studied phonetics, American studies and philosophy but left university prior to graduation.  Career  In his one-man comedy show Was guckst du?!, Yanar toys with well-known cultural stereotypes both as host and main performer. For one of his best known sketches about an East Indian, Ranjid and his pet cow (and substitute best friend) Benita, he practiced pidgin-English for months, which he learned from some Indian friends of his from university. He also parodies the stereotypical way Turkish migrants use to speak. Furthermore, he toured through Germany with solo programmes. Fixations of his programmes \\"Made in Germany\\" (2008), \\"Live und unzensiert\\" (2009) and \\"All Inclusive!\\" (2013) were broadcast by German TV station RTL. He also presented the ZDF-Show \\"Kaya Yanar testet Deutschland – die Multi-Kulti-Show (2007)\\" as part of a theme week focusing on integration. Because of his great success being without precedent for an artist with Turkish migration background in the German- speaking countries at the time of his appearance, Yanar is considered as a key figure and trailblazer for the acceptance of multicultural issues. Since December 2012 Yanar is godfather of the \\"Heinrich-Middendorf-Oberschule Aschendorf\\" in the project \\"Schule ohne Rassismus – Schule mit Courage\\" (\\"School without racism - school with courage\\"). In 2014 RTL started broadcasting his show \\"\\"Geht's noch?! Kayas Woche\\"\\", a weekly current affairs programme with a mixture of stand up comedy and political satire. Kaya Yanar is also a member of the jury in the German \\"Comedy Grand-Prix\\"; an annual comedy contest which is broadcast on TV to seek the \\"best German comedian\\".

The remainder of his tenure with the club was spent on the fringes of the first team, playing for the Reserves, for whom he was the leading scorer in 1971–72. Manchester City and Rochdale In February 1973, Whelan was on the verge of signing for Bolton Wanderers when his mother received a phone call from Manchester City manager Malcolm Allison. He was offered a month-long trial with the club, and within three weeks he had been offered a professional contract and was making his debut against West Ham United, starting up front with Francis Lee on 17 March 1973.

Early life Malmstadt was born on 17 February 1922 in Marinette, Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1943 with a B.S. degree doing undergraduate research in organic chemistry. After graduation, he became an ensign in the US Navy, attending naval electronics and radar schools at Princeton University, MIT, Bell Labs, San Diego Fleet School, and Pearl Harbor. He became supervisor for the Department of Electronics Fundamentals at the Naval Radar School on Treasure Island, California before being released from the US Navy in 1946 with the rank of senior lieutenant. In 1948 he received an M.S. degree and a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1950 (both from the University of Wisconsin–Madison). His thesis was titled \\"High Frequency Titrations.\\" He joined the University of Illinois as faculty in 1951 becoming a professor in 1962. Malmstadt's major areas of research were in precision null-point potentiometry, emission and absorption spectrochemical methods, automatic titrations, and automation of analytical methods. His book, Electronics for Scientists (co-written with Christie G. Enke), was seminal in introducing thousands of scientists to electronic methods of scientific data collection, leading to the nickname of \\"High Voltage Malmstadt\\". Malmstadt had a patent design for a titration apparatus. This was manufactured from 1954 by Sargent and sold under his name. Malmstadt wrote ten internationally used textbooks and more than 150 scientific articles.  Ministry  In 1978, Malmstadt retired from the faculty at the University of Illinois, to co-found the Pacific and Asia Christian University, which was renamed the University of the Nations in 1989; he served as International Provost and later International Chancellor. Malmstadt is also known for students that went on to highly successful academic research careers, including Stanley R. Crouch (Michigan State University), M. Bonner Denton (Arizona), Willard W. Harrison (University of Florida), Gary M. Hieftje (Indiana University), Gary Horlick (Alberta), and James D. Winefordner (University of Florida). In 2000 Malmstadt coauthored \\"Courageous Leaders Transforming Their World\\". In 2007, John Feaver wrote a biography of Malmstadt. ReferencesPublications * Howard V. Malmstadt, Christie G.

The flag and the uprising When she was 20 and working as a head teacher in the Panagyurishte girls' school, she was asked to sew the flag for the April Uprising by Georgi Benkovski, which she accepted. The lion on the flag was drawn by Stoyan \\"Banenetsa\\" Karaleev after the pattern of the lion printed on the cover of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee's organization chart and the letters were drawn by Ivancho Zografa. Besides the Свобода или смърт (Svoboda ili smart, Freedom or death) inscription, the letters П and О (standing for Панагюрски окръг, the Panagyurishte revolutionary district) were added at the bottom. On 22 April, the day of the flag's sanctification by priests from neighbouring villages, Rayna sewed tassels prepared during the night to it. The flag's size is 2 by 1.5 m, it has two sides and is hemmed by a strip of gold lace. On the day the uprising was proclaimed, she waved the flag together with Georgi Benkovski. After it was brutally crushed by Ottoman troops, she was captured, beaten and allowed only to eat bread and water for more than a month in the Plovdiv prison. For the commemoration of the uprising's 25th anniversary, Rayna Knyaginya prepared three copies of the original flag, two of them surviving until today and the other one being destroyed during the bombings of Sofia in World War II. Rayna Knyaginya Later life After her time in the prison, she managed to reach Moscow through Istanbul with a forged passport, where she studied medicine for three years and became a maternity nurse. There she wrote her autobiography, the first book about the uprising, that was first published in Russian and then translated to Bulgarian in 1934. While in Moscow, she managed to arrange the upbringing of 32 orphans from Panagyurishte, including her younger brother, through a ladies' charity committee. Rayna Knyaginya was then invited by Kliment of Tarnovo to become a teacher in Tarnovo. She returned to Panagyurishte three years later to marry Vasil Dipchev, the mayor of the town. They moved to Plovdiv, where Dipchev, an extreme Russophile, was unable to find a job under the Russophobic government of Stefan Stambolov.

Vasil Dipchev was elected a deputy to the National Assembly of Bulgaria in 1888 and the family moved to Sofia.

It is characterized by a limited number of ingredients and simplified cooking. This type of cuisine was prevalent in canteens everywhere in the Soviet Union. It became an integral part of household cuisine and was used in parallel with national dishes, particularly in large cities. Generally, Soviet cuisine was shaped by Soviet eating habits and a very limited availability of ingredients in most parts of the USSR. Most dishes were simplifications of French, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian cuisines. Caucasian cuisines, particularly Georgian cuisine, contributed as well. Canteens run by the government were called stolovaya.\\"Vegetarian and Vegan Food in Russian Stolovaya – Cheap, Healthy and Homely\\" Vegan Trekker. Accessed January 2019. In the West, Soviet cuisine is frequently conflated with Russian cuisine, though the particular national cuisine of Russia is quite different. Approach Ukrainian borscht with smetana, pampushky, and shkvarkas An everyday Soviet full course meal (lunch or dinner) consisted of three or four courses, typically referred to as \\"first\\", \\"second\\", \\"third\\", and \\"fourth\\"; an optional salad was not numbered. In a restaurant, one could eat anything one liked in any order, but in a typical canteen, especially in a workers' or students' canteen, one would normally have received what was called a \\"combined lunch\\" (kompleksny obed). The first course was a soup or broth, i.e., \\"liquid\\" food. The second was some kind of \\"solid\\" food: meat, fish, or poultry with a side dish, called \\"garnish\\" (). Garnishes typically included potatoes in a variety of forms, buckwheat kasha, macaroni, etc. Bliny, baked dishes ( zapekanka), or eggs could also be served as the second course. The third was something to drink: tea, coffee, kompot, milk, kefir, etc. The fourth was a dessert. Typical vegetable salad made of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and dressed with smetana Green vegetables and salads were seasonal, and with some exceptions uncommon at the table. Spices were rarely used and food had a generally mild taste. There were no differences between breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Lunch was always consumed with a soup as a first course. A tradition of a \\"fish day\\" on Thursdays, when fish or other seafood was consumed instead of meat, was started in State-run canteens and cafeterias to alleviate a shortage of meat, but nevertheless filtered to many private households. The common approach, which still somewhat holds today in Russia is: eat a lot at each meal, few times a day. Eat nothing between meals – the reason for this was that the State-run eateries in the Soviet time was largely under the control of doctors, and the medical wisdom at the time was that snacking between major meals would ruin the appetite (especially for children) and will lead to indigestion and intestinal distress. A typical lunch meal could consist of chicken-broth-based soup or borscht for a first course and fried meatballs or goulash served with boiled potatoes or buckwheat porridge as a main course. Butter or sour cream was typically used as a sauce. Zakuski at a celebration table Holiday meals were typically derived from old French and Russian cuisines with extensive use of heavy sauces, marinated meats, and melted cheese. Mixing ingredients and extensive cooking was common, just as in classic French cuisine. Generally, much effort was made in order to prepare such meals.

It featured editors of 1UP.com along with the magazine editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly and Games for Windows: The Official Magazine. Like the website, the podcast focused on various aspects of modern gaming culture. Since its creation in 2005, the show has featured previews and reviews of games, as well as in-house debates and discussions on recent developments in the gaming community. The 1UP Show was canceled after UGO.com bought out 1UP and the production crew got laid off. Some of the staff of The 1UP Show (Jason Bertrand, Rob Bowen, Matt Chandronait, Jay Frechette, Ryan O'Donnell and Cesar Quintero) started their own video production company, Area 5 Media, and its accompanying website, Area5.tv, featuring a show called CO- OP, which for all intents and purposes was a continuation of The 1UP Show. The program was picked up by Revision3 in March 2009. CO-OP ceased production in 2010. History The first episode of The 1UP Show became available on October 21, 2005. It began as a low-budget side project created by Jane Pinckard and Ryan O'Donnell, both of whom also wrote the majority of the show's scripted segments. The two were aided in the show's production by then- Managing Editor of 1UP.com, Che Chou. In the show's second season, production values of the show were raised significantly, with the addition of professionally made video graphics and high quality footage, as well as a theme song written and performed by Jane Pinckard and Eric Haller. On January 7, 2009, the 1UP Network was sold by Ziff Davis to the UGO Network. In a blog postMatt's 1UP BlogEntry: The End of The 1UP Show by Matt Chandronait, the most recent producer of the video podcast, it was revealed that it would no longer be produced after the acquisition. Style The show was shot largely in and nearby the offices of 1UP and its affiliated magazines, though some portions were filmed on location at press events and game shows. Though various episodes of The 1UP Show featured brief segments of scripted skits and lighthearted segues, the majority of content was off-the-cuff. Not The 1UP Show When The 1UP Show could not make its weekly deadline, it was usually replaced with alternate video series titled Not The 1UP Show that featured its own, less news-related segments. This included Broken Pixels, in which members of the staff (notably \\"Rest of the Crap\\" writer Seanbaby of Electronic Gaming Monthly) were simply filmed laughing and \\"enjoying\\" poorly received video games such as Bible Adventures on the NES and Escape from Bug Island on the Wii. This segment has since been seen as an offshoot from the show it started on. While The 1UP Show was focused on game coverage, Not The 1UP Show was more focused on gaming and gaming culture. Seasons=Season One: October 2005 - December 2005 The first season of The 1UP Show contains 10 episodes, loosely tied together through a series of ongoing skits. Usually, these skits will take place during the cold open of an episode and before the closing title card. Original music for the series was composed by Ryan O'Donnell. Though the show featured an opening title sequence featuring members of the 1UP.com staff, neither the cast nor crew of The 1UP Show were formally credited. Season Two: January 2006 - June 2006 Season 2 of The 1UP Show saw the introduction of a standard opening credits sequence, accompanied by an original theme song written and performed by Eric Haller and Jane Pinckard. Managing Editor Che Chou left the 1UP.com staff and Ziff Davis early in the season to work under Microsoft (under the Turn 10 development team) to develop an Xbox 360 game, Forza Motorsport 2.

It included Olympia, the site of the Ancient Olympic Games, and Dyspontium. This area subsequently formed part of the territory of ancient Elis. The existence of an ancient district called Pisatis (ἡ Πισᾶτις) is indicated by many ancient authors, but whether or not there was such a town in the most ancient times is now disputed by scholars. Evidence indicates that such a town did exist in the 4th century BC.Mogens Herman Hansen, Thomas Heine Nielsen, An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis. OUP Oxford, 2004. pp.500,501 Pisatis area The current location thought to be Pisa is about 1km east of Olympia. A confederacy of eight states apparently existed in Pisatis, of which, besides Pisa, the following names are recorded: Salmone, Heracleia, Harpinna, Cycesium, and Dyspontium. The celebration of the festival of Zeus at Olympia had originally belonged to the Pisatans, in the neighbourhood of whose city Olympia was situated. Legendary foundation Pisa was said to have been founded by an eponymous hero, Pisus, the son of Perieres, and grandson of Aeolus; but others derived its name from a fountain Pisa.; Eustath. ad Dionys. Per. 409. Modern writers connect its name with Πῖσος, a low marshy ground, or with Πίσσα, the name of the black fir or pinetree. It was celebrated in mythology as the residence of Oenomaus and Pelops. The Virgilian commentator Servius wrote that the Teuti, or Pelops, the king of the Pisatans, arrived on the Tyrrhenian coast after the Trojan War and founded the Italian (and more famous) Pisa in the 13th century BCE. Upon the conquest of Pisa by the Eleians, the presidency of the festival passed over to their conquerors; but the Pisatans never forgot their ancient privilege, and made many attempts to recover it. Early Olympic games In the eighth Olympiad (747 BCE) the Pisatans succeeded in depriving the Eleians of the presidency by calling in the assistance of Pheidon I, tyrant of Argos, in conjunction with whom they celebrated the festival. But almost immediately afterwards the power of Pheidon was destroyed by the Spartans, who not only restored to the Eleians the presidency, but are said even to have confirmed them in the possession of the Pisatis and Triphylia. In the Second Messenian War the Pisatans and Triphylians revolted from Elis and assisted the Messenians, while the Eleians sided with the Spartans. In this war the Pisatans were commanded by their king Pantaleon, who also succeeded in making himself master of Olympia by force, during the 34th Olympiad (644 BCE), and in celebrating the games to the exclusion of the Eleians.-2 The conquest of the Messenians by the Spartans must also have been attended by the submission of the Pisatans to their former masters. In the 48th Olympiad (588 BCE) the Eleians, suspecting the fidelity of Damophon, the son of Pantaleon, invaded the Pisatis, but were persuaded by Damophon to return home without committing any further acts of hostility. But in the 52nd Olympiad (572 BCE), Pyrrhus, who had succeeded his brother Damophon in the sovereignty of Pisa, invaded Elis, assisted by the Dyspontii in the Pisatis, and by the Macistii and Scilluntii in Triphylia. This attempt ended in the ruin of these towns, which were razed to the ground by the Eleians. et seq. From this time Pisa disappears from history; and so complete was its destruction that the fact of its ever having existed was disputed in later times. Although Pisa ceased to exist as a city from this time, the Pisatans, in conjunction with the Arcadians, celebrated the 104th Olympic festival in 364 BCE. Later testimonies Pausanias found its site converted into a vineyard. Its situation, however, was perfectly well known to Pindar and Herodotus. Pindar frequently identifies it with Olympia;e.g. Ol. 2.3 and Herodotus refers to Pisa and Olympia as the same point in computing the distance from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens.

Originally opened as a grammar school in 1961, the school became a comprehensive in 1975. It adopted its current name in September 2018, after joining the Dudley Academies Trust. History The large population growth of the Sedgley and Coseley urban districts in the mid 20th century saw rising demand for school places, resulting in the construction of the Dormston Secondary Modern School in the 1930s, along with several primary schools. Plans for a grammar school to serve the two districts emerged by the 1950s, and the High Arcal Grammar School finally opened in September 1961. Control of the school passed to Dudley Council in April 1966 as a result of Sedgley's amalgamation into Dudley. As with other schools in Dudley, the school's age range was altered to 12–18 from September 1972. In September 1975 it became a comprehensive school. Its sixth form centre closed in July 1990 as part of further reorganisation by the local authority, and from September of the following year, the age range was altered to 11–16. In September 2002 a new sixth form was opened at the school by Dudley College. In December 2011, the school hosted a broadcast of the BBC Radio 4 show Any Questions?. This event was later repeated in December 2019 in the run up to the General Election. In September 2017, the school became part of the Dudley Academies Trust, alongside Castle High School (St. James' Academy), The Hillcrest School (The Link Academy), and Holly Hall School (Pegasus Academy), in association with Dudley College. Its name was officially changed to Beacon Hill Academy the following year. Headteachers The first headteacher of the school was Mr Laurence Ardern, he served for 14 years, from the schools opening until his retirement in July 1975. He was succeeded by Mr John Gerrish, who retired in December 1992 after serving the school for 17 years. Mr Jeffrey Williams, who had previously been a geography teacher at the school, then returned to the school as headteacher; he resigned in August 2006 after 14 years of service. His work at the school transformed the already well respected former grammar school into what was probably the most well regarded secondary school in the area at that time. Most of the school facilities today were acquired and built during his term as headmaster and he is still spoken about with a great deal of respect, even to this day. Sadly the career of Mr Williams will most likely be remembered by his quiet and sudden exit in the summer of 2006 after being convicted of kerb crawling, Mr Williams was succeeded by his deputy head Mrs Jo Manson, who became the school's first female headteacher and built upon the foundations laid by her predecessor. She led the school into a continued \\"outstanding\\" OFSTED status and helped to acquire the school a second specialism in gifted and talented learning. After 10 years of leading the school Jo Manson retired in April 2016. Mrs Jo Bull (another former deputy head) then took over from Mrs Manson as Headteacher, she became the schools shortest serving headteacher when she left after just 17 months in the role. When the Dudley Academies Trust took over the school in September 2018 and it transitioned from The High Arcal School to become Beacon Hill Academy, the college made significant changes to the leadership teams of all of their Academies, this saw Jo Bull resign and Mr Sukhjot Dhami take on the role as interim Principal, he was supported in this role by Angelina Robin-Jones (Executive Principal of the academies trust). In January 2020 Mr Mark Thorogood became the first permanent headteacher of the new Beacon Hill Academy , but he resigned in May 2020 after just 3 active months in the role. Mr Sukhjot Dhami, who had been acting head twice before, helped to guide the school through its toughest ever period (the COVID-19 global pandemic) and took over permanently as Principal in June 2020. Mr Dhami, who has been a teacher at the school for 15 years, continues to serve as Principal of the school. Houses & Years The school was previously divided into a house system, houses consisted of four houses named after local stately homes (Attingham, Himley, Boscobel and Whitwick). The houses participated in both physical and academic competitions, they competed in sports such as cricket, football, tennis and rugby. The students in each house had a 'Head of House' and a 'Student Support Manager', this gave students a member of staff who they could talk to about any concerns either with school life or specific subjects. Each house also had student leaders with the roles of house captain and sports captain. Each house had two house captain's, two sports captain's, 2 deputy sports captains and 2 deputy house captains (one male and one female in each role). These roles were given to suitable year 11 students From September 2019, the house system was disbanded, along with Head of Houses. The school is now broken down into year groups with each group being assigned their own 'Learning Manager' (Head of Year).

It provides education for pupils aged 11 to 18 years. History It was built as a secondary modern school by Sedgley Urban District Council in 1964 near the Ellowes Hall stately home (which was demolished that year), to replace a smaller secondary school at nearby Redhall, but since 1966 has existed within the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. In September 1972, the age of pupils starting the school was increased to 12 in order to comply with the LEA's decision to increase the secondary school starting age. In September 1975, the school's status changed to comprehensive and a sixth form was added, making it a 12–18 school. However, the school was reorganised to an 11–16 comprehensive in September 1990 as most of the remaining sixth forms in the Dudley borough were replaced with expanded facilities at further education colleges. In September 1993, the school became grant-maintained, only to return to Dudley LEA's control in 1998. By this date, a new classroom block and library had been constructed, and the main hall had been refurbished. A performing arts block was opened in 1999. Just after the school became grant maintained, the governors seized the opportunity to restore sixth form facilities to the school and the new sixth form opened in September 1995. In 2004, the school gained specialist sports status. In 2008, Ellowes became the highest ranking of the three Sedgley secondary schools in GCSE examinations for the very first time when an impressive 63% of pupils finished their compulsory education with five or more grades at C or above including English and Mathematics. This placed Ellowes as the fifth highest of the Dudley Borough's 21 secondary schools. Its success continued in 2010 with 90% of students gaining five or more grades at C and above with 66% including English and Mathematics. Previously a foundation school administered by Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Ellowes Hall Sports College converted to academy status in March 2015. However the school continues to co-ordinate with Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council for admissions. Location The school serves the villages of Lower Gornal and Gornal Wood, where the majority of the school's pupils live. A lesser number of pupils are from the Upper Gornal area, while some are from over the border in Dudley on the Milking Bank housing estate that was mostly developed during the 1980s. Ellowes Hall is located on the Stickley Estate, which is predominantly made up of pre-war council housing built by Sedgley UDC, though many homes have been bought off the council under the right to buy scheme. The estate is situated just to the north-west of Lower Gornal village centre, and is approximately two miles from the centres of nearby towns Sedgley and Dudley. The majority of pupils starting at Ellowes are former pupils of Roberts Primary School, Redhall Primary School, Straits Primary School and Milking Bank Primary School, though a handful of pupils have been taken in from schools including Cotwall End Primary School and – until its closure in 2006 – Sycamore Green Primary School. Ofsted The latest Ofsted report in November 2012 praised the school with an 'Outstanding' award in all four categories.http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/103871 Ofsted reports Invictus Education Trust The \\"Invictus Education Trust\\" is the academy to which Ellowes Hall, Leasowes High School, Ounsdale High School, The Crestwood School and Kinver High School are all part of. The Sixth form is governed by Mr A S Griffiths. The Invictus Trust was created in March 2015 by the founding schools: Crestwood School, Ounsdale High School, Ellowes Sports College and Kinver High School with Leasowes joining in Autumn 2016. The word Invictus was specifically chosen as the dictionary states it is ‘indomitable or unconquerable’. After creating the Education Trust, they then brought about the genesis of the 'Invictus Sixth Form' in which all of these schools involved are part of. More information about the 'Invictus Education Trust' is available here: http://www.invictus.education/. Drama productions The school produces plays, such as Fiddler on the Roof, Oliver!, The Sound of Music, Les Misérables, and most recently Billy Elliot. Drama productions take place in the performing arts suite, which was built in 1999 at a cost of £200,000.

He was appointed CEO on 2 December 2016, succeeding Paul Allen. Before becoming CEO of Vulcan Inc., he was the Senior Vice President and General Manager at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Cloud business unit, where he was responsible for engineering, product management, and product marketing. Prior to HPE, Bill spent ten years at Microsoft in a variety of leadership roles.  Career = IBM  At IBM, Hilf was a senior software architect and helped to build the company's Open-source strategy in the early 2000s. According to Wired, “IBM was one of the first companies to realize the benefits of software that anyone can use and modify for free.”  Microsoft  Hilf was then recruited by Microsoft in 2004 to help the company understand and work with the open-source software community. While at Microsoft, Hilf worked in a variety of leadership roles, including Windows Server and helping to build the company's cloud service, Microsoft Azure. Hilf was instrumental in architecting Microsoft's early open- source strategy. For this work, he was recognized as one of the 25 most influential people at the company.  Hewlett-Packard  In 2013, Hilf joined HP with the goal of helping the company become “the world’s best provider for enterprises who want to build hybrid clouds” according to Wired. As its senior vice president, Hilf led the HP Cloud Research and Development and business operations. In 2016, the company underwent an organizational shift and announced Hilf was leaving the company to “pursue new opportunities.” In an email to GeekWire, Hilf wrote, “For me personally, when I joined, I made a commitment to build the cloud business here at HP for three years, and I’m now 3 years and one month in, and we have had very strong growth – just this past June HPE Helion was recognized as a leader in the private cloud market for the third year in a row. So this is the right time for me to help move the technologies and teams more deeply into the company, and to pursue new opportunities.”  Vulcan Inc.

In this role, he is tasked with guiding the company's diverse commercial and philanthropic endeavors—from capital investment and real estate to tackling climate change to promoting access to arts and culture among others.  Philanthropy = High Five Hope  On a business trip to the Philippines for Microsoft in 2008, Hilf came across kids playing basketball on the streets with rags wrapped into a ball. As a former basketball player and amateur coach himself, he joined in. That experience led him to think about using sports as a tool to help kids. In 2008, Hilf launched High Five Hope, a non-profit aimed at “bringing the power of structured, supportive sports programs to street children in the Philippines. Initially, focused on basketball, High Five Hope has expanded to include a variety of sports like girls’ volleyball and futkal—a type of street soccer.

There are approximately 420 pupils on the school roll. The school's head teacher is Mrs Claire Williams. History Cotwall End was built by Sedgley Urban District Council and opened on 30 April 1962, as a 5–7 infant and 7–11 junior school, with a nursery for children under 5 opening later in the 1960s. During the 1970-71 academic year, an infant school building was added on the site (being officially opened in April 1971), but reorganisation in September 1972 saw the infant school become a first school and the junior school a middle school, with children now transferring to secondary school at the age of 12 instead of 11. However, the oldest age group in the first school were taught in the same buildings as the middle school pupils. The two schools merged in 1981 to form a single primary school. The school had a nursery unit which was built during the 1960s, but it closed down and the building was incorporated into the new middle school in 1972. Mr Clifford Whitehouse retired in July 1977 after serving Cotwall End as head teacher of the Junior/Middle School for its first 15 years. Michael Harvey then spent a term as interim head teacher. When the secondary transfer age was reverted to 11 in September 1990, the building was taken over by a local playgroup. The playgroup disbanded in December 2000 and the building was demolished the following year. Mr Kenneth Thomas was appointed head teacher in January 1978 and remained in the post until he retired in April 2003. Many teachers who taught at Cotwall End went on to be head teachers at other local primary schools; these included deputy head teachers Michael Harvey, David Cox, Phillip Everington, Adrian Slack and Leonard Hazelhurst, as well as class teachers Eric Tibble, Ann Mason and Joy Powell. The old nursery unit was demolished in April 2001, four months after the local playgroup closed. This was due in part to an education authority reorganisation and to the poor state of the buildings. The school has been served by a schoolhouse since about 1970; this has largely been occupied by the school caretaker, however under Mrs Attwell’s reign, during the 1980’s, the House was unoccupied as she lived on the Brownswall Estate. Later, the occupants were caretaker Mr Alfred Taylor and crossing lady Mrs Jean Taylor and their three children. Jean is the cousin of former footballers Peter and Cyril Knowles. The occupant of the schoolhouse is Mr Martin Waldron, school caretaker since 2000. A full-time nursery opened in September 2007, the school's first such facility in 35 years. For the previous 13 years, the school had been served by a twice-weekly pre-school club called \\"Cotty Kitten\\", which was open to pupils in their final term prior to compulsory education and took place in various sections of the infant school. The playgroup which ran between 1990 and 2001 was not connected to the school. Mrs Nicole Anderton retired in July 2016 to be succeeded by Mrs Claire Williams, former head teacher of Bramford Primary School.

Academic standards Cotwall End School from its inception in 1962 always prided itself in the very high academic standards (compared to local primary schools) it set itself and its pupils. When the 11-plus examination was in place in the school's early years, the majority of the school's pupils passed the exam to attend High Arcal Grammar School, although with the introduction of comprehensive education in the Dudley borough from September 1975, pupils attended Dormston or High Arcal, depending which school's catchment area they lived in. Since the 1990s, however, many pupils leaving the school have transferred to a number of other secondary schools due to a relaxation of catchment area regulations. The school has a broad curriculum, including English, mathematics, science, geography, history, information technology, physical education, music (including instrumental music), and religious education. In 2005, an OFSTED inspection of the school found that the overall effectiveness of the school, and in particular progress in English, mathematics, and science was inadequate, particularly in Years 3 through 6. The school was given a Notice to Improve. The school's strengths include physical education, art, and music. However, in October 2006 Ofsted said that it was \\"a satisfactory and improving school\\" and praised the efforts of Anderton. The school regularly comes in the upper section of the Dudley borough's Key Stage 2 SATs league tables. Extracurricular activities Extracurricular activities include sports such as football, basketball, and cross-country running, and musical activities like orchestra and choir. There is an after school club. The school is represented by separate football teams for boys and girls. The boys football team is the longest established, and has enjoyed success in local competitions which include several league championships. In spring 2005 the children worked with resident artist Ilona Bryan to produce a mosaic based around exotic birds.

It is operated by Chiltern Railways. History At one period there were four different railway routes from the northern end of Princes Risborough station, although there has only ever been one to the south. The first railway to reach Princes Risborough was the Wycombe Railway, which opened its extension from High Wycombe as far as on 1 August 1862.MacDermot vol. I, part I, p. 438Mitchell & Smith, Apr. 2002, Historical BackgroundMitchell & Smith, April 2003, Historical Background There were three intermediate stations on this section: West Wycombe,West Wycombe station under construction The Transport Archive Princes Risborough and . The cost of construction of the station building was £1104 9s 5d and additional general costs were £824 8s 0d. The station building as built was a typical Wycombe railway design with an open porch at the right hand end on the platform elevation, the design was the same as West Wycombe, Bledlow and Wheatley, and also on the original part of the Wycombe railway Cookham, Marlow Road, Wooburn Green and Loudwater. A branch of the Wycombe Railway was opened from Princes Risborough to on 1 October 1863.MacDermot vol. II, p. 6 The Wycombe Railway was worked by the Great Western Railway, and was absorbed by that railway in 1867. The Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway opened its line on 15 August 1872; that railway became part of the GWR on 1 January 1884.MacDermot vol. II, p. 623 The original station building was located a few hundred yards further north than the present site. The original building was extended at the north end to provide extra office accommodation between 1870 and 1880, and a curved roof canopy covering the platform may have also been added at the same time. Further additions to the building were made between 1894 and 1896. A second platform was added when the Watlington branch was opened in 1872 although there was only a single track between the two platforms. In 1892 a new signal box was brought into use and a new passing loop, so the second platform was rebuilt with two tracks between them. A footbridge was also provided at this time. The Great Western & Great Central Joint Committee was created with the dual objective of providing the Great Central Railway with a second route into London, bypassing the Metropolitan Railway; and of providing the GWR with a shorter route to the Midlands.MacDermot, p. 416Jenkins, pp. 8-9 Central to this scheme was the upgrading of the existing GWR route between and Princes Risborough, which was transferred to the Joint Committee at its establishment on 1 August 1899. The line was extended in a north-westerly direction to Ashendon Junction, at which point the joint line ended, and a GCR route ran northwards to Grendon Underwood Junction, just south of ; both sections opened for goods on 20 November 1905, and for passengers on 2 April 1906.Jenkins, p. 11Mitchell & Smith, Nov 2006, Historical Background Continuing in the same north-westerly direction from Ashendon Junction, the Bicester cut-off line, which was purely GWR property, was opened for goods trains on 4 April 1910, and to passengers on 1 July 1910.MacDermot, p. 448Mitchell & Smith, Sep 2002, Historical Background The branch closed to passengers on 1 July 1957, and the route to Oxford via Thame closed on 7 January 1963; services over the GCR route ceased on 5 September 1966, leaving the present network of two lines to the north, to and to Aylesbury. The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974.Railway Magazine, May 1974, p. 248 Chiltern Railways considered reinstating the Wycombe Railway's Oxford extension via Thame, but instead constructed a chord at Bicester to permit services to run from the main line onto the westernmost section of the Varsity Line, restored between Bicester and Oxford; this permitted a new service to Oxford which opened in 2015. Princes Risborough Station, platform 3 Part of the Watlington branch line has been reopened by the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway, which extended its heritage railway service to a new platform face at Princes Risborough station on the site of the former platform to Watlington, Platform 4; although the platform opened in August 2018, the platform as well as the Railway is still being maintained. Princes Risborough station currently has four platforms: Platform 1 for Aylesbury; Platform 2 from Aylesbury to London (via High Wycombe); Platform 3 for Bicester, Banbury, Oxford and Birmingham; and Platform 4 for the Chinnor and Princes Risborough Heritage Railway. Originally, two through roads allowed non-stop running clear of the platform roads. Radical cuts on the Chiltern Main Line and Great Central Main Line in the 1960s left the station with only two usable platforms - the current platforms 1 and 2. In 1998 to increase capacity on the line Chiltern Railways reinstated platform 3, the down platform, on top of the old down platform road, in a manner similar to that at West Ruislip. Fragments of the original down platform are still visible at the station. The 'up' through road, removed from service as part of previous drastic running-down of the route which left only two usable platforms, was restored in September 2011 as part of Chiltern's Evergreen 3 upgrade project. Signal box The signal box pictured in 2009 Built in 1904, Princes Risborough North Signal Box, located towards the northern end of Platform 3, is the largest surviving Great Western Railway signal box in the country. It closed in 1991 when modernisation of the line moved signalling operations to Marylebone and became a Grade II listed building after a successful public campaign to save it from demolition. The Chinnor and Princes Risborough Railway Association were granted an agreement with National Rail allowing them to maintain the box and undertake restoration work after a period of neglect left the box damaged by weather and vandals. Work had previously ceased in 1998 due to safety concerns but was resumed in 2013.

The label focused primarily on modern rock, rap, dance-pop, and hip- hop. The label closed in the early 1990s, and then resurfaced in 2010 to re- release its music catalog, and that of related labels, digitally. Background Kempner had a background in concert promotion, and had run the New Year's Eve Christian music festival series at Knott's Berry Farm, growing the event to one of the largest Christian events in the country before forming Frontline. The label officially took flight by the signing of local bands from the Orange County, California area. In that first year, Frontline released 16 albums. In 1986, the company signed a distribution deal with Nashville-based Benson Records to tap into their extensive sales force and distribution through Zondervan Music. Frontline Records soon transitioned to Frontline Music Group (FMG), allowing the company to create different sub-labels to promote their growing and diverse roster of alternative, punk, dance, pop, rock, gospel, metal, rap, and hip-hop artists. Initial distribution was through Benson Records. Artist Terry Scott Taylor became the production manager for the label, and drummer Ed McTaggart became the primary art director, designing many of the label's album covers. Imprints included Intense Records, Alarma! Records (a resurrection of Taylor's early 1980s label), and MYX Records (a dance music label supervised by Scott Blackwell). Frontline carried pop and rock artists such as Crumbächer, Crystal Lewis, Idle Cure, Jon Gibson, Altar Boys, Shout, and Rick Elias. Alarma Records was created to feature alternative music acts like Mad at the World, Jacob's Trouble, The Swirling Eddies, and Poor Old Lu. Its sister label, Alarma World, was home to international-based acts like Edin-Ådahl and Walk On Water. Intense Records housed metal-based bands such as Tourniquet, Bloodgood, Sacred Warrior, and Deliverance. MYX Records was a dance/hip hop label headed by former New York club DJ Scott Blackwell. and represented many of Blackwell's own creations and other rap/hip-hop artists like Gospel Gangstaz, P.I.D., and D-Boy. Frontline Records became an important label in the development of the West Coast Christian alternative music scene. Their roster included what 7ball magazine would later refer to as \\"truly classic alternative, rap, metal, and rock\\" music, and HM editor Doug Van Pelt would call \\"the lion's share\\" of classic hard Christian music. Frontline saw growth from 1986-1991 where the company especially dominated Christian media outlets and radio airwaves. In 1992, Kempner and his executive staff decided not to renew its distribution deal with Benson and, instead, hired its own sales force and signed an independent distribution deal to garner more control over its own brands. Initially the move seemed to be working but soon FMG started showing signs of losing its momentum. The financial requirements to sustain itself were greater than expected. Even though some new artists were signed, most notably Angie and Debbie Winans, Gary V, and Carol Huston, the label spiraled down until it could no longer keep itself afloat and by the mid-90s closed its doors. Frontline and all of its assets were acquired by Nashville-based record producer and publisher, William \\"Buddy\\" Killen, under Killen Music Group, KMG Records, in early 1998. KMG released double CDs to infuse the marketplace with top-selling Frontline artists. Things went well until 2002 when Diamante, the distributor for KMG Records, folded and the label went down with it. Buddy died in November 2006 of cancer. In 2010, Carolyn Killen, executrix of his Estate, sold the Frontline publishing catalog to Meis Music Group. In 2011, the KMG, Frontline, and Damascus Road Records master recordings were sold.

Pisenti was born in Perugia, Umbria, to a family of university professors. In 1912 he graduated in jurisprudence at the University of Bologna. The following year he moved to Pordenone, Friuli, where he began his political career as a member of the town council, which he held from 1915 to 1919, elected on conservative list. In 1920 he founded in Pordenone the far right party Unione del Lavoro (Labour Union), which was later absorbed into the National Fascist Party (PNF). He entered the PNF in 1921, and soon became a captain of the Blackshirts in Friuli, as well as a national-level figure of Fascism, and editor of Giornale del Friuli. In 1926 Pisenti was expelled from the PNF, as he disagreed on some internal regulations of the party. The following year, however, he was readmitted into high office, becoming one of Benito Mussolini's closest collaborators (Mussolini described him as \\"the man who, throughout twenty years of Fascism, has had the bravery of his very own brilliant heterodoxy\\"). In 1924 he was elected as to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, a position he held without interruptions until 1939. After the armistice of September 8, 1943, he remained loyal to Mussolini, and joined the leadership of the Italian Social Republic - in November of that year, he was appointed its Minister of Justice. In this position, he refused to pardon the former Fascist leaders who had organized the fall of Mussolini in 1943 (including Galeazzo Ciano, Emilio De Bono and Carlo Pareschi), and who were sentenced to death in the Verona trial.I Montanelli,Storia d'Italia 1943-1948 pag 98, RCS editore, 2003 After the end of World War II, Pisenti was arrested and jailed for a year.

Until 1992, it was known as the South London Art Gallery, and nowadays the acronym SLG is often used.Giles Waterfield and Nicola Smith, 'Art for the People' in History Today, Volume: 44 Issue: 6, June 1994, pp.55-58 Margot Heller became its director in 2001. Gallery=History Thomas Henry Huxley The gallery traces its origins back to the South London Working Men's College at 91 Blackfriars Road in 1868, whose Principal was the biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, the grandfather of Aldous Huxley; the Manager was William Rossiter. In 1878, the College relocated to 143 Kennington Lane, where a Free Library was also opened. In 1879 Rossiter staged an art show of privately owned works at the Library. After this the name was changed to the Free Library and Art Gallery. In 1881, the library and gallery moved again to New Road, Battersea, and in 1887 to 207 Camberwell Road. Leading artists such as Sir Frederic Leighton, President of the Royal Academy, Edward Burne-Jones and G. F. Watts supported the institution; the Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone, was its first president, succeeded by Leighton in 1887. On 4 May 1891, The South London Fine Art Gallery opened in Peckham Road in a new building in the grounds of Portland House, whose freehold Rossiter had purchased. In 1893, the Prince of Wales officially opened a lecture hall and library funded by newspaper owner John Passmore Edwards. In 1896, the Gallery was relocated at the Vestry of Camberwell. In 1898, Royal Academy President, Sir Edward Poynter opened a Technical Institute, which again had been funded by Passmore Edwards (to commemorate Lord Leighton who had died) on the site of Portland House. It later became Camberwell College of Art, which was run by the London County Council from 1904, though the Gallery was still under the local authority. The Gallery added to its permanent collection in 1953, to celebrate the coronation, with works by contemporary artists such as John Piper and Christopher Wood, and the next decade acquired over 500 twentieth-century prints. The new London Borough of Southwark took over responsibility for the Gallery in 1965 but under independent trustees. Modern phase The appointment of David Thorp as Director in 1992 brought what then came to be known as the South London Gallery into its present phase, when it espoused Britart and staged significant \\"cutting edge\\" exhibitions. The Gallery was the first venue for the showing of Tracey Emin's \\"tent\\", Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, when Carl Freedman curated the Minky Manky show in 1995. The show catalogue includes an interview with Emin. Other artists in the show were Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Damien Hirst, Mat Collishaw, Gilbert and George, Critical Décor and Stephen Pippin. Freedman said one of the show's themes was: > the artist as a subject, and (to) explore the relationship between the art > on the wall and its creator, to make the whole thing more humanistic. And in > there somewhere there is the beginnings of a thesis on the relationship and > similarities between madness and modernism, for example, defiance of > authority, nihilism, examples of extreme relativism, strange transformations > of the self, irrationality, and things like that. Minky Manky then went to the Arnolfini gallery, Bristol. Two years later Emin staged a solo show I Need Art Like I Need God, which included a debate with artist Billy Childish about their former relationship. A strong programme of exhibitions gained the gallery increased publicity and greater visitor numbers, as well as a place in the 1996 Prudential Awards for the Arts, and a nomination for Thorp in 1997 for the Prudential Creative Britons Award. Exhibitors included Anselm Kiefer and Gavin Turk. Works were acquired by artists such as Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas and Angus Fairhurst. In 1999, Curator Donna Lynas began a Live Art programme, which incurred some controversy, with performances including Franko B and Stuart Brisley. In 2001, Margot Heller became Director continuing to develop the gallery's international reputation for its programme of contemporary art exhibitions and live art events, with integrated education projects for children, young people and adults. Five exhibitions each year profile the work of established international figures such as Tom Friedman, Mark Dion, Rivane Neuenschwander, Alfredo Jaar, Eva Rothschild, Ryan Gander and Superflex; as well as that by younger and mid-career artists such as Alice Channer and Oscar Murillo. Group shows bring together works by established and lesser known British and international artists. The gallery’s live art and film programme has included presentations by Rachel Gomme, Nathaniel Mellors, Gail Pickering, OMSK and Gisele Vienne, and occasional large scale off-site projects have included those by on Kawara in Trafalgar Square in 2004, and Chris Burden at Chelsea College of Art Parade Ground in 2006. The South London Gallery is at 65 Peckham Road, London SE5 8UH.

Nicoletti was murdered on March 29, 1977. Early life Nicoletti was born on December 3, 1916, in Chicago. He was the second son of two sons to Philip Nicoletti and Grace Alessi, Italian immigrants from Santa Caterina Villarmosa, Sicily, Italy. His family lived in Near West Side, Chicago. On February 25, 1929, at the age of 12, Nicoletti shot four times his father, allegedly in self-defense. His father who was a drunkard, attacked Charles and pursued him with a knife, he ran into his father's room, where a gun was kept in a bureau drawer. Two days later, Nicoletti was exonerated by the Cook County coroner. He dropped out of school in eighth grade and soon joined the Forty-Two Gang. At the time, the gang's members included such future Outfit members as Giancana, Sam \\"Teets\\" Battaglia, Lew Farrell, \\"Mad Sam\\" DeStefano and William \\"Willie Potatoes\\" Daddano. Outfit assassin By the late 1950s, along with Felix Alderisio, Nicoletti was one of the most feared triggermen in Chicago and was drawing attention from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Chicago police. A number of times Nicoletti and Alderisio teamed up for a \\"hit\\", including one occasion on which they were discovered by police sitting on the floor in a car later dubbed \\"the hitmobile\\" by reporters. This car had special compartments where guns were stored and special switches to turn lights off at certain times. When questioned by police the two said they were \\"waiting for a friend\\". In 1962, Nicoletti took part in an infamous torture case. He, Alderisio, Carlo \\"Duke\\" Olandese and Tony \\"the Ant\\" Spilotro, had kidnapped 24-year-old Billy McCarthy, a thug who had killed two Outfit associates with the help of Jimmy Miraglia, also age 24. The three men started torturing McCarthy to find out the name of his accomplice. Spilotro had placed the man's head in an industrial vice and started squeezing it tighter and tighter. Suddenly, McCarthy's eye popped completely out of its socket. At that point, he revealed his accomplice's name; then both men were killed. Years later, Tony Spilotro told this story to his friend Frank Cullotta. Spilotro was impressed by Nicoletti's reaction to the gory scene: \\"Boy, this is a heartless guy. He was eating pasta when Billy's eye popped out\\". In the 1960s, Nicoletti was questioned by two FBI agents, including Agent William F. Roemer Jr., to see whether they could develop Nicoletti as an informant against the Outfit. According to Roemer, Nicoletti gave him the names of several car dealerships he worked at and was very cordial; apparently, all the employment leads checked out. But Nicoletti never flipped and never talked to the FBI again, though there was eventually talk in Chicago that Nicoletti had flipped. It has been alleged that Nicoletti was involved in as many as 20 mob hits during his career as a hitman. In 2010, Playboy magazine published an article by Hillel Levin in which Nicoletti was implicated in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by James Files, an inmate within the Illinois Department of Corrections, and Chauncey Marvin Holt. Death On March 29, 1977, Nicoletti was shot three times in the back of his head while waiting in his Oldsmobile in the parking lot of the Golden Horns Restaurant in suburban Northlake, Illinois. He was brought to the Northlake Community Hospital where he died six to seven hours later. Nicoletti's car was never turned off and consequently overheated and caught on fire, causing initial incorrect press reports that his car was firebombed. Nicoletti was due to testify before the House Select Committee on Assassinations at the time of his death. According to Roemer, Chicago mob assassin Harry Aleman is the suspected hitman. Nicoletti is buried at Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.

While the roots of naked parties come from the nudism movements and campus streaking, the modern \\"naked party\\" movement appears to have its roots at Brown University in the 1980s. Attendees of naked parties often report that they stop feeling awkward after just a few minutes since everyone has disrobed before entering the party and since everyone's nudity is accepted, regardless of body type. (dead link 10 February 2020) According to reports, most naked college parties are sex-free. At Brown University, the nakedness is \\"more of an experiment in social interaction than a sexual experience\\". The spread of naked parties has sparked international controversy. Some students do not like the idea of their schools being associated with them. These concerns have been discussed in different works of literature, such as Tom Wolfe's I Am Charlotte Simmons and Natalie Krinsky's Chloe Does Yale. Religious groups have attempted to have nude parties banned in some municipalities.

The garden is noted for its collection of exotic trees and shrubs and offers views over Mount's Bay and The Lizard. History First mentioned in 1319 as Trethigwaynton, the name comes from the Cornish language gwenton (springtime). The current dwelling has been on the site since at least the 16th century and was altered and extended in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house is a grade II listed building. The walled garden, which was built in Elizabethan times, seems to have been constructed as a response to the period of persistently cooler weather known as the Maunder Minimum. The wall prevented warm air from escaping from the garden on cool nights, thereby allowing frost-sensitive fruit trees to survive, despite the cooling climate.Tim Ball, \\"Environment Canada and the UN(IPCC) ignore major climate change mechanism,\\" in The Landowner, August–September, 2012, p. 41. In 1814 the estate was bought by Rose Price the son of a Jamaican sugar plantation owner. Trengwainton was sold following the loss of income resulting from the 1833 Emancipation Act which freed slaves on the family’s Worthy Estate in Jamaica. In 1867 the property was bought by Thomas Simon Bolitho. In 1877 it was inherited by his son Thomas Robins Bolitho. He extended it with several rooms in 1880; and in 1925 he bequeathed it to his nephew, Edward Hoblyn Warren Bolitho. Rose Price planted trees and built the walled gardens, which are said to be based on the dimensions of Noah’s Ark, and in 1925 Edward Bolitho and his head gardener Alfred Creek continued the development of the garden. They were opened to the public, for the first time, in 1931. The Victoria Medal of Honour for Horticulture was awarded to Edward in 1961 and in the same year he donated 98 acres to the National Trust,National Trust celebrates its 50 years at ‘gem’ of a garden.

Kolkata is also the headquarters of Botanical Survey of India and Zoological Survey of India and many more organisations and companies. Economic history and recent developments Tata Centre, JL Nehru Road Kolkata was the capital of the British Indian Empire until 1911. Throughout British Raj, the city was a major port and commerce center in world economy. The Partition of India in 1947 was a major blow to the once flourishing economy during the world wars, it removed most of the hinterland, cutting down the supply of the human resource and a took away a huge portion of its market. Also the huge inflow of refugee from East Pakistan was a major drain to the city's infrastructure which was inadequate for the population boom. In the 1970s, the city saw a predominance of the trade-union movements which led the investors to flow out of the state to other newly emerging destinations in India. As the investors lacked trust in the newly formed communist government, the lack of capital destroyed most of its small-scale industries like foundrys and tool casting. Once India's leading city, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the decades following India's independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade-unionism, which included frequent strikes that were backed by left-wing parties. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, several factories were closed and businesses relocated. The lack of capital and resources added to the depressed state of the city's economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet: the \\"dying city\\". Since the late 1990s, Kolkata has managed to board the all-India bandwagon of buzzing economic sectors like information technology (IT) and business process outsourcing (BPO), along with a good pace of development matching all India average with the liberalization of the Indian economy. In 2009, Kolkata was ranked the hardest of 17 Indian cities in which to do business by the World Bank.However in 2019, Kolkata, along with Bengaluru was included in the list of cities in India for the World Bank's ease of doing business survey in India, which so far covered only Delhi and Mumbai.https://www.livemint.com/news/india/wb-s-ease-of-doing-business-survey- to-also-cover-kolkata-bengaluru-next-year-11571918678598.html GDP of Kolkata SBI Regional HQ, Strand Rd According to recent estimates of Kolkata's economy is more than $170 billion making it third most-productive metropolitan area in India, after Mumbai and Delhi.

Zatracheidids are distinguished by lateral (sideways) bony protuberances of the quadratojugal bone of the skull, and a large opening in the snout called the internarial fontanelle (sometimes the internarial fenestra) that is bordered by enlarged premaxillae. The skull is flattened, with small orbits or eye sockets set far back. The opening in the snout may have housed a gland for producing a sticky substance so that prey would adhere to the tongue. If so, this indicates that these animals spent a large part of their time on land. Acanthostomatops vorax  History of study  There are three genera of zatracheidids: Acanthostomatops Kuhn, 1961; Dasyceps Huxley 1859; and Zatrachys Cope, 1878. Only Dascyeps is represented by a species in addition to the type species. The name Zatracheidae was first coined by Cope (1882). Numerous variations on this, such as 'Zatrachydae' and 'Zatrachydidae' have been used in the literature, as have permutations derived from Acanthostomatops such as 'Acanthostomidae.'  Anatomy  Zatracheidids are recognized by their wide and flat skulls with a greatly enlarged preorbital region that is distinguished by the large internarial fontanelle, with corresponding large premaxillae. A correspondingly large intervomerine fontanelle is found on the palate. The quadratojugal is expanded, and in Acanthostomatops and Zatrachys, bears discrete spiky projections. The quadratojugal also obscures the quadrate in dorsal profile. Dasyceps and Zatrachys are only confidently known from cranial material. Development Zatracheidids are one of several temnospondyl groups that are speculated to have undergone metamorphosis from young to adult. Both Zatrachys and Acanthostomatops are known from ontogenetic series, but that of Acanthostomatops is more complete and is the only one that would definitively capture metamorphosis. Spikes developed during metamorphosis, and as zatrachydids continued growing as adults, the pits and grooves on their skulls grew more extensive and the otic notch at the back of the skull grew wider. These notches likely supported membranes called tympana, which serve as ear drums in living amphibians. The choanae also grew larger during metamorphosis, and are distinguished by their irregular shape, which differs from the more circular shape seen in other temnospondyls. Zatrachydids also possess a hole in the center of their palates called the inter-vomerine fontanelle, which grows larger during metamorphosis. This hole is seen in living salamanders and frogs and is associated with an organ called the intermaxillary gland, which produces secretions that make the tongue sticky. It may also have been present in zatrachydids.

His brother died in 1920 and Gunnar Helland ran Helland Brothers alone until he closed down in 1927, at a time when the demand for violins was in decline. In 1927, Gunnar Helland moved to Minneapolis and spent two years working at Lundh & Rowe for Jacob Lundh (1865-1951) and Frederick Rowe (1884-1976). In 1929, he moved to Fargo, North Dakota where he established the Helland Music Company on the third floor of a building on Broadway. The business remained there until 1962 when it was bought by Lloyd Hammond. Gunnar continued to work for Lloyd Hammond until he was over 80. He built his last Hardanger fiddle in 1937. Gunnar Helland made several design changes on his later violins including lamination inside the sound holes for increased strength, shorter sound holes, a lower profile and a pattern that was much closer to the style of Guarneri del Gesu.

Khullars are actually descendants of sage in the Himalayas some 1200 years back. They are all offspring of a sage called Gomas Rishi. Later on they have scattered at different places all around the world. According to other information available, Some Khullars have migrated from Kabul Afghanistan and now mostly are based in Samrala, Machiwara and Firozepur (Punjab India). Prior to the partition in 1947, Khatri clans, such as Churamani, Nanda, Khullar, Jerath, Chopra and Vig were particularly associated with the city of Ludhiana in Eastern Punjab (today in the Indian state of Punjab (India). But prior 1947 there were some Khullars who belongs to villages Sargoda and Kahna Kacchha Pakistan. The Khullars are also settled in the cities of Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar for the last three centuries. The Khullars of Basti Guzan in Jalandhar have gone to other places like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi due to their government service postings and have settled there. Some have immigrated abroad to Australia, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and various parts of Africa in search of jobs and have settled there. There is a place near ludhiana called village \\"Bharri\\". Every year the people there organise a huge fair and all the people from Khullar community go there and pray in front of Khullar's Sati Mata,( Kul Devi).

Notes  ","title":"Geography of Kolkata"},{"id":"4432207","text":"The Wrath of Elihu (1805) by William Blake; one of his series of illustrations of the Book of Job Elihu ( ’Elihu) is a man in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Job. He is said to have descended from Guz who may be from the line of Abraham (Genesis 22:20–21 mentions Buz as a nephew of Abraham). Synopsis of Elihu's Monologues He is mentioned late in the text (chapter 32), and opens his discourse with more modesty than displayed by the other antagonists. Elihu differs from the others in that his monologues discuss divine providence, which he insists are full of wisdom and mercy. He claims that the righteous have their share of prosperity in this life, no less than the wicked. He teaches that God is supreme, and that one must acknowledge and submit to that supremacy because of God's wisdom. He draws instances of benignity from, for example, the constant wonders of creation and of the seasons. Chapter 32 of the Book of Job is directed at Job's three friends. Chapters 33 through 35:3 consist entirely of Elihu's speech to Job. Possible pseudonymity of the character The speeches of Elihu (who is not mentioned in the prologue) contradict the fundamental opinions expressed by the 'friendly accusers' in the central body of the text, that it is impossible that the righteous should suffer, all pain being a punishment for some sin. Elihu states that suffering may be decreed for the righteous as a protection against greater sin, for moral betterment and warning, and to elicit greater trust and dependence on a merciful, compassionate God in the midst of adversity. Some question the status of Elihu's interruption and didactic sermon because of his sudden appearance and disappearance from the text.Harley, John E. The Book of Job, Pages 28–29. (Wm. B. Eerdman Publishing Company, 1988) Even scholars who regard the book of Job as a literary composition by a single author tend to see in Elihu’s speeches an early addition or commentary to the original book. He is not mentioned in Job 2:11, in which Job's friends are introduced, nor is he mentioned at all in the epilogue, 42:7–10, in which God expresses anger at Job's friends. He does not say anything that is not said more succinctly by the three original friends or by God, and his speech contains more Aramaisms than the rest of the book. Elihu's preface in chapter 32 indicates that he has been listening intently to the conversation between Job and the other three men. He also admits his status as one who is not an elder (32:6–7.) As Elihu's monologue reveals, his anger against the three older men was so strong he could not contain himself (32:2–4.) Elihu's speech finishes abruptly at the end of Chapter 37. Possible authorship According to Albert Barnes, Lightfoot and others believed that the Book of Job was written by Elihu.

She is a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). Griefahn was a member of the German Parliament (1998–2009), serving as an expert on cultural affairs and media as well as foreign (cultural) policy. From 1990 to 1998 she was the State Minister of the Environment in the State of Lower Saxony. From 1980 to 1990 she was an activist in the environmental organization Greenpeace and the first woman on the international board of Greenpeace (1984–1990). Early life and education After finishing school in 1973 Griefahn went to the universities of Göttingen and Hamburg to study mathematics and social sciences. She left university in 1979 with a diploma in sociology. Starting in 1973 she worked for the German-French Youth Organization and for YMCA Hamburg, offering adult education seminars for trade unions, church organizations and NGOs for more than a decade. Political career=Early activism From 1980 onwards she became active in establishing Greenpeace in Germany, with its main office in Hamburg. She was the executive director until 1983. With Greenpeace Germany she organized campaigns against, among other environmental issues, chemical pollution as well as campaigns for the protection of the North Seas and the rivers Rhine and Elbe. In 1984 she became the first female member of the international board of Greenpeace. She was responsible for developing programs and skill training for the people working for Greenpeace all over the world until 1990. Additionally she helped found new offices in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Latin America and the former Soviet Union. Griefahn joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) Germany in 1992. State Minister for the Environment, 1990-1998 In 1990 Minister-President Gerhard Schröder of Lower Saxony named her as the Minister for the Environment, where she started special programs to support removable energy systems (wind, solar, biomass) in order to stop the use of nuclear power (more see \\"Public Offices\\"). One of her central concerns in environmental policy was to quit to the use of nuclear energy. Her plans, which finally became reality in 2011, were blocked by directives of the Federal Ministry of the Environment, headed by Klaus Töpfer (1990–1994) and Angela Merkel (1994–1998). Parallel to her commitment against nuclear power Griefahn hurried along the extension of renewable energy in Lower Saxony with measures like an eco-fund and an atlas for wind energy. Her commitment contributed to the fact that the plans to phase out nuclear power became a reality between 1998 and 2005, when a coalition of the Social Democratic Party and the Greens led the Federal Government. In 2001 the law on the abandonment of nuclear energy came into effect. As State Minister of the Environment, Griefahn initiated new policies on waste management. Waste had usually been stored on disposal sites or burnt in incineration plants. Griefahn put her focus on products which could more easily been disassembled, on the separation of different waste types and on different waste treatments – such as composting or mechanical separation.

For artists born and active in the Southern Netherlands, see the List of Flemish painters. The artists are sorted by century and then alphabetically by last name. In general, artists are included that are mentioned at the ArtCyclopediaartcyclopedia.com website, in the Grove Dictionary of Art,groveart.com and/or whose paintings regularly sell for over $20,000 at auctions.web.artprice.com Active painters are therefore underrepresented, while more than half of the artists are baroque painters of the 17th century, roughly corresponding to the Dutch Golden Age. The names of older artists often have many different spellings; the preferred spelling is used as listed in the Netherlands Institute for Art Historyrkd.nl database, but several painters are listed twice when their common alternative names are alphabetically far apart. __TOC__ 14th and 15th century Jeroen Bosch, c. 1490 Albert van Ouwater, c. 1450 *Bosch, Hieronymus ('s-Hertogenbosch 1450 – 's-Hertogenbosch 1516) *Bouts, Dieric (Haarlem 1415 – Leuven 1475) *Christus, Petrus (Baarle 1415/1435 – Bruges 1476) *David, Gerard (Oudewater 1460 – Bruges 1523) *Engelbrechtsz, Cornelis (Gouda c. 1462 – Leiden 1527) *Geertgen tot Sint Jans (Leiden?

Day is a senior program officer for the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences, where he has served as a study director on studies concerning NASA's aeronautics flight research capabilities, the planetary exploration program, the size of the astronaut corps, the threat of asteroids striking Earth, NASA workforce skills, radiation hazards to astronauts on long duration spaceflights, U.S. Air Force astrodynamics standards, and other projects. He previously served as a program officer on the Space Studies Board. He has also written extensively on the history of American satellite reconnaissance. Career He received a doctorate degree in political science from The George Washington UniversityBiography of Dwayne A. Day from the website of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, for which he was an investigator where he specialized in space policy and management of the national security bureaucracy. His dissertation, \\"Mission Control,\\" concerned how President Dwight D. Eisenhower created specialized bureaucracies to manage the ICBM, U-2 spyplane, and Corona spy satellite programs, thereby bypassing the cumbersome Air Force bureaucracy. From 2002-2003 he worked as the Congressional Budget Office Historian, where he wrote an unpublished history of the organization. In 2000, while under contract to the U.S. Air Force, he wrote a book on the U.S. Air Force Chief Scientist's Office. The book, Lightning Rod, detailed the creation, evolution, and influence of the senior scientific adviser to the uniformed leadership of the Air Force (the Air Staff). Day has written many articles in space magazines including Spaceflight, Quest, Novosti Kosmonavtiki and other publications such as Space News. He is an associate editor of the German spaceflight magazine Raumfahrt Concret. Day published the book Eye in the sky about the CORONA spy satellite program, and was investigator for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, where he focused on the policy, budgetary, managerial and institutional causes of the Columbia accident. Day is regarded as one of a handful of experts on the history of the U.S. military space program, particularly American intelligence satellites. Among his contributions in this area is the first publication of a photograph of a satellite launched during a classified Space Shuttle launch, the first discussion of the evolution of the early American electronic intelligence satellite programs during the 1960s, and the first detailed discussion of the Satellite Data System communications relay satellites used by the National Reconnaissance Office. He has also written extensively on the intelligence analysis of the Soviet space program during the Cold War, such as the Soviet effort to place a man on the Moon in competition with Apollo.Dwayne A.

Day is also known as the originator of the \\"Von Braun Paradigm\\" theory. The theory is that American space policy has for decades followed a pattern largely established by von Braun in a series of articles published in the 1950s in Collier's magazine. The simplified theory is that American space leaders have sought to develop space capabilities in a series of steps: develop a space shuttle to construct and service a space station which is then used to establish a lunar base, ultimately leading to a human mission to Mars. The theory has been discussed in books and papers by space historians Howard McCurdy, Roger Launius, and Michael Neufeld.Roger D. Launius, Space Stations: Base Camps to the Stars (Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press, 2002), 26-27; Launius and Howard E.

In that capacity he has served as a study director for several studies for NASA. These studies include \\"Space Radiation Hazards and the Vision for Space Exploration,\\" \\"Building a Better NASA Workforce: Meeting the Workforce Needs for the National Vision for Space Exploration,\\" \\"Grading NASA's Solar System Exploration Program: A Midterm Report,\\" \\"Opening New Frontiers in Space: Choices for the Next New Frontiers Announcement of Opportunity,\\" and \\"Science Opportunities Provided by NASA's Constellation System.\\" He was recently the study director of a study to assess detection and mitigation strategies for near-Earth object hazards which produced the report \\"Defending Planet Earth: Near-Earth-Object Survey and Hazard Mitigation Strategies,\\" and co-study director of an analysis of radioisotope power systems for robotic spacecraft. He is currently assistant study director of the planetary science decadal survey. He is also currently study director of a study on the future of NASA's spaceflight crew office, and a study of NASA's flight research projects, both for the Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. Day is a regular contributor to The Space Review, writing on subjects such the Blackstar spaceplane, and the Chinese space programme. He also quoted a 1974 memo from the CIA Director complaining about Skylab photography of Area 51: :“The issue arises from the fact that the recent Skylab mission inadvertently photographed” the airfield at Groom Lake. “There were specific instructions not to do this,” the memo stated, and Groom “was the only location which had such an instruction.” In other words, the CIA considered no other spot on Earth to be as sensitive as Groom Lake, and the astronauts had just taken a picture of it. In November 2007, Day published an article containing the photograph that the Skylab 4 astronauts took of Groom Lake, the first time this photo appeared in a public document.

He represented Australia in both rugby codes as well as in athletics making him one of only four Australians who have represented their country at full international level in three different sports. He represented as a Wallaby in 6 Tests in 1961 and as a Kangaroo in 8 Tests from 1962. Early life Cleary was born in Randwick, New South Wales and was educated at Waverley College. At aged 17 having set a number of schoolboy sprint records he was offered a sporting scholarship to Stanford University which he declined with his sights set on representing Australia in athletics. Rugby union In 1959 he joined the Randwick DRUFC and he played in the club's 1960 winning first-grade premiership side. He was selected in the Australian national side for all three Tests of the 1961 series against Fiji and made further Wallaby appearances against France and against the Springboks on the 1961 tour of South Africa. Athletics After leaving rugby union and during his first year of rugby league with the South Sydney Rabbitohs he maintained his amateur status to enable his selection for the Commonwealth Games later that year. He represented Australia in Athletics at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, collecting the Bronze Medal for the 100 yard sprint. The Gregory's source records him as having clocked 9.3 secs for the 100 yards during his athletic career. In 1964 he beat the rugby league speedster Ken Irvine in a A£2,000 match race at Wentworth Park, and in 1966 he won the Australian professional 130m sprint race. Rugby league Cleary joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1962 along with Jim Lisle his Wallaby three-quarter partner. Cleary was a Winger with the club throughout the 1960s playing in three premiership winning sides in 1967, 1968 and 1970. Cleary finished his first grade career with the Rabbitoh's neighbouring club, the Eastern Suburbs Roosters, in 1971. This made him ideally suited to represent his future NSW State electoral district of Coogee, which sits close to the geographic border between the two clubs. His international rugby league debut in the 1st Test against Great Britain in Sydney on 9 June 1962 saw Cleary become Australia's 29th dual-code international, following Arthur Summons and preceding Jim Lisle. He made Test appearances against New Zealand in 1963, 1965 and 1969; against France in 1964 and was selected for the 1963-64 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France during which he made one Test and twenty tour match appearances. Triple international He is one of only four Australian sportsmen to represent internationally in three different sports at the senior level (see also Dick Thornett and Snowy Baker). Politics and community Cleary joined the Labor Party in 1965 and was the State member for Coogee in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1974 to 1991 and was the NSW Minister for Sport and Recreation and Tourism in the Wran Labor Government from 1981 to 1988. From 1986 to 1988 he was also the NSW Minister for Racing. He was at one time or another the Chairman Sports House Advisory Committee, member North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, member Coogee Surf Life Saving Club and a director South Sydney Leagues Club. In the Queen's Birthday Honours list of 1992, Cleary was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia for his service to the New South Wales Parliament,It's an Honour – Officer of the Order of Australia and in 2000 he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his achievements as a Kangaroo player.It's an Honour – Australian Sports Medal He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999.

In his first reply to Job's complaints, he argues that those who are truly good are never entirely forsaken by Providence, but that punishment may justly be inflicted for secret sins. He denies that any man is innocent and censures Job for asserting his freedom from guilt. Eliphaz exhorts Job to confess any concealed iniquities to alleviate his punishment. His arguments are well supported but God declares at the end of the book that Eliphaz has made a serious error in his speaking. Job offers a sacrifice to God for Eliphaz's error. Eliphaz, the first of the three visitors of Job (), was supposed to have come from Teman, an important city of Edom (; ; ). Thus Eliphaz appears as the representative of the wisdom of the Edomites, which, according to , , and , was famous in antiquity. The name \\"Eliphaz\\" for the spokesman of Edomite wisdom may have been suggested to the author of Job by the tradition which gave this name to Esau's son, the father of Theman (; ). In the arguments that pass between Job and his friends, it is Eliphaz who opens each of the three series of discussions. His primary belief was that the righteous do not perish; the wicked alone suffer, and in measure as they have sinned (). This argument is, in part, rooted in what he believes to have been a personal revelation he received through a dream (Job 4:12-16): \\"Can mankind be just before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker? He puts no trust even in His servants; And against His angels He charges error. How much more those who dwell in houses of clay\\" (). After mulling it over, Job responds to this \\"revelation\\" of Eliphaz (9:2), \\"In truth I know that this is so; but how can a man be in the right before God? If one wished to dispute with Him, he could not answer Him once in a thousand times.\\" Eliphaz refers to his revelation again for emphasis in . Bildad also refers to Eliphaz's revelation in chapter 25, although he presents the concept as his own. Job rebukes him for it: \\"What a help you are to the weak! How you have saved the arm without strength! What counsel you have given to one without wisdom! What helpful insight you have abundantly provided! To whom have you uttered words? And whose spirit was expressed through you?\\" Job pokes fun at Bildad asking him what spirit revealed it to him because he recognizes the argument as Eliphaz's spiritual revelation. Although quick-witted, and quick to respond, Eliphaz loses his composure in chapter 22, accusing Job of oppressing widows and orphans, a far cry from how he had originally described Job: \\"Behold you have admonished many, and you have strengthened weak hands. Your words have helped the tottering to stand, and you have strengthened feeble knees. But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed. Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?\\" Eliphaz also misconstrues Job's message as he scrambles to summarize Job's thoughts from chapter 21. \\"You say, ‘What does God know? Can He judge through the thick darkness? Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see; And He walks on the vault of heaven.'\\" Job wasn't arguing that God could not prevent evil. Job was observing that in this life God often chooses not to prevent evil. Conventional wisdom told Eliphaz that God should immediately punish the wicked as that would be the just thing to do. Job, however, saw it differently, and in 24:1, Job laments. \\"Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?\\" Job yearns for the justice Eliphaz claims exists – an immediate punishment of the wicked. However, that simply didn't hold true according to Job's observations. Nevertheless, Job doesn't question God's ultimate justice. He knows justice will eventually be served. Job asks, \\"For what hope have the godless when they are cut off, when God takes away their life? Does God listen to their cry when distress comes upon them?\\"  See also  *Bildad *Zophar * Elihu  References  Category:Hebrew Bible people Category:Prophets in Judaism Category:Book of Job ","title":"Eliphaz (Job)"},{"id":"4432348","text":"Ilam Hall circa 1880. Ilam Park is a country park situated in Ilam, on both banks of the River Manifold five miles (8 km) north west of Ashbourne, England, and in the ownership of the National Trust. The property is managed as part of the Trust's White Peak Estate. (Ashbourne, the 'post town', is in Derbyshire and thus so is Ilam's postal address, but the Park, and Ilam, are in Staffordshire the county boundary being the River Dove). The property consists of Ilam Hall and remnants of its gardens, an ancient semi-natural woodland -- Hinkley Wood -- designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), noted for its small-leaved and large-leaved limes and their hybrids. The old Ilham Hall in 1807. Ilam Hall Ilam Hall in 2007 The estate was owned from the 16th century, for over 250 years, by the Port family. It was sold to David Pike Watts in 1809. On his death in 1816, the old hall was inherited by his daughter who had married Jesse Russell. Russell (as Jesse Watts-Russell, High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1819 and Conservative MP for the rotten borough of GattonHistory of Parliament online) commissioned James Trubshaw to build a new Hall to designs by John Shaw; the Hall, now a Grade II* listed building, was built between 1821 and 1826. By the early 1930s it had been sold for demolition. The demolition was well advanced when Sir Robert McDougal bought it for the Trust, on the understanding that the remaining parts (the entrance porch and hall, the Great Hall and the service wing) be used as an International Youth Hostel. Today Ilam Hall is leased to the Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales) (YHA).

Surf boats which represented each of the past 18 host cities were on the Yarra River as were flags of the participating countries. A W-class Melbourne tram with wings attached was lowered into the stadium. A performance followed based on a poem by Michael Leunig, involving a boy with a duck which was an artificial one at first, and koalas, (people dressed in koala 'suits'). At the end of the display, the boy came into the Stadium with a real white duck. The opening ceremony had many themes, including Melbourne's Wurundjeri Indigenous heritage and Melbourne's fickle weather. The role of the boy was performed by 12-year-old (almost 13) Sean Whitford, who had been selected from thousands of candidates. Australian rock band The Church played Under The Milky Way to accompany a performance by the Australian Ballet, with aerial work performed by students of the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA).  Parade of nations  Contrary to tradition, the nations did not enter the stadium in alphabetical order, but by regions of the Commonwealth. European nations entered the stadium first, followed by those from Africa, Asia, the Americas, the Caribbean and finally, Oceania. English athletes and officials entered the stadium first (as the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester) while the host nation, Australia entered last. The athletes entered with The Cat Empire playing a specially written musical 'set', tailoring music to specific regions.  Queen's baton  The final leg of the Queen's Baton Relay included the baton being handed to the 16 captains of the Australian Football League across the floating flags and fish along the Yarra River. After each of the captains had carried the baton, the last of the captains handed the baton to Ron Barassi, who walked on a semi submerged pontoon, giving the effect that he was walking on water (some commentators joked that the stunt \\"proved what most of us suspected\\"). Barassi then handed the baton to Herb Elliott.  CGF flag hoist  The Commonwealth Games Federation flag was then brought into the stadium by eight Young Australian of the Year recipients. The athlete's oath was taken by Adam Pine.  Queen's birthday celebration  Harry White, a 13-year-old boy, who was youth ambassador, presented a message to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. After a rather controversial furore before the start of the Games regarding the decision by the Organising Committee not to include God Save the Queen in the Opening Ceremony, a Happy Birthday medley was sung by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa in tribute of the Queen's 80th birthday (37 days hence), ending with eight bars from God Save the Queen. Michael Fennel, the president of the Commonwealth Games Federation then spoke.  Queen's baton handover  The final bearers of the Queen's Baton were all former elite world-class athletes who had successfully competed at both the Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games. They were: * Cathy Freeman (who lit the Olympic Flame at the 2000 Sydney Olympics), who brought the Queen's Baton into the stadium, and then handed the baton to *Ron Clarke (who lit the Olympic Flame at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics), who then handed the baton to * Marjorie Jackson-Nelson, then-Governor of South Australia, who then handed the baton to * John Landy, then-Governor of Victoria, who presented the Queen's Baton to The Queen.  Opening of the games  The Queen then read the message of greeting which she had placed in the baton (366 days earlier on Commonwealth Day, 14 March 2005), declaring the games open.  In the end  Australian singer Delta Goodrem sang Together We Are One, the theme song for the 2006 games while many fireworks were ignited, within the stadium, on the backs on roller-bladers circling the singer, and fireworks were also ignited on the banks of the Yarra, as well as the floating pontoons, and Melbourne's larger skyscrapers.

It was an attempt to make the QF 6 pounder anti-tank gun into a self-propelled artillery piece. It was employed only during the North African Campaign from 1942 to 1943. History The Deacon was developed in 1942 to provide British Army units in North Africa with a mobile anti-tank weapon. It can be seen as a development of the practice of carrying smaller artillery pieces en portee (sitting on the back of trucks). This meant that the artillery could quickly move albeit with some loss of traverse. The basis of the Deacon Gun Carrier was an AEC Matador truck chassis. A 6-pounder gun with enclosed armoured shield was mounted on the flat bed at the rear of the chassis. The gunner and loader operated the gun from behind the shield. The conventional cab was replaced with a boxy armoured construction that covered the engine and the driver's position. Production started in December 1942 and 175 were built. Combat service The Deacon was used against German armoured vehicles in North Africa, an environment in which wheeled vehicles were as manoeuvrable as tanks. They are credited with action at El Hamma, where the 76th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, was the victor in a battle against a German force that included Panzer III tanks. Deacons were withdrawn at the end of the campaign in North Africa, as they were not considered suitable for use in Europe. Some were converted to armoured ammunition carriers and others were sold to Turkey in 1943. British self-propelled guns with ecclesiastical names Giving it the name Deacon was part of what became consistent naming of British self- propelled guns with ecclesiastical titles. A 1941 design with the Ordnance QF 25-pounder was nicknamed \\"the Bishop\\", as its appearance was said to resemble a bishop's mitre. A replacement, the US 105 Millimeter Howitzer Motor Carriage M7, was given the service name \\"Priest\\" by the British, as part of its superstructure was said to resemble a priest's pulpit. A related design in 1943 with the QF 25-pounder was \\"Sexton\\". In more recent post-war years, the Royal Artillery used a self-propelled gun known as the \\"Abbot\\".

An example of a euryhaline fish is the molly (Poecilia sphenops) which can live in fresh water, brackish water, or salt water. The green crab (Carcinus maenas) is an example of a euryhaline invertebrate that can live in salt and brackish water. Euryhaline organisms are commonly found in habitats such as estuaries and tide pools where the salinity changes regularly. However, some organisms are euryhaline because their life cycle involves migration between freshwater and marine environments, as is the case with salmon and eels. The opposite of euryhaline organisms are stenohaline ones, which can only survive within a narrow range of salinities. Most freshwater organisms are stenohaline, and will die in seawater, and similarly most marine organisms are stenohaline, and cannot live in fresh water. Osmoregulation Osmoregulation is the active process by which an organism maintains its level of water content. The osmotic pressure in the body is homeostatically regulated in such a manner that it keeps the organism's fluids from becoming too diluted or too concentrated. Osmotic pressure is a measure of the tendency of water to move into one solution from another by osmosis. Two major types of osmoregulation are osmoconformers and osmoregulators. Osmoconformers match their body osmolarity to their environment actively or passively. Most marine invertebrates are osmoconformers, although their ionic composition may be different from that of seawater. Osmoregulators tightly regulate their body osmolarity, which always stays constant, and are more common in the animal kingdom. Osmoregulators actively control salt concentrations despite the salt concentrations in the environment. An example is freshwater fish. The gills actively uptake salt from the environment by the use of mitochondria-rich cells. Water will diffuse into the fish, so it excretes a very hypotonic (dilute) urine to expel all the excess water. A marine fish has an internal osmotic concentration lower than that of the surrounding seawater, so it tends to lose water (to the more negative surroundings) and gain salt. It actively excretes salt out from the gills. Most fish are stenohaline, which means they are restricted to either salt or fresh water and cannot survive in water with a different salt concentration than they are adapted to. However, some fish show a tremendous ability to effectively osmoregulate across a broad range of salinities; fish with this ability are known as euryhaline species, e.g., salmon. Salmon has been observed to inhabit two utterly disparate environments -- marine and fresh water -- and it is inherent to adapt to both by bringing in behavioral and physiological modifications. Some marine fish, like sharks, have adopted a different, efficient mechanism to conserve water, i.e., osmoregulation. They retain urea in their blood in relatively higher concentration. Urea is damaging to living tissue so, to cope with this problem, some fish retain trimethylamine oxide. This provides a better solution to urea's toxicity. Sharks, having slightly higher solute concentration (i.e., above 1000 mOsm which is sea solute concentration), do not drink water like marine fish.

Low salinities can be caused by rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, or able to tolerate a wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots. Despite having a regular freshwater presence, the Atlantic stingray is physiologically euryhaline and no population has evolved the specialized osmoregulatory mechanisms found in the river stingrays of the family Potamotrygonidae. This may be due to the relatively recent date of freshwater colonization (under one million years), and/or possibly incomplete genetic isolation of the freshwater populations, as they remain capable of surviving in salt water. Freshwater Atlantic stingrays have only 30-50% the concentration of urea and other osmolytes in their blood compared to marine populations. However, the osmotic pressure between their internal fluids and external environment still causes water to diffuse into their bodies, and they must produce large quantities of dilute urine (at 10 times the rate of marine individuals) to compensate. ;Partial list *Atlantic Stingray *Bull Shark *Green chromide *Herring *Lamprey *Mummichog *Molly *Guppy *Puffer fish *Salmon *Shad *Striped bass *Sturgeon *Tilapia *Trout *Barramundi *Mangrove Jack *White Perch *Killifish *Desert pupfish File:Rachycentron canadum.pngCobia File:Mugil cephalus.jpgFlathead mullet File:Shark fish chondrichthyes.jpgBull shark Other euryhaline organisms File:Seagrass Halodule uninervis (5777808662).jpgthe seagrass Halodule uninervis File:S. droe.JPGGreen sea urchin File:Phyllorhiza punctata (White-spotted jellyfish) edit.jpgWhite-spotted jellyfish File:Cerastoderma glaucum MHNT 1.jpglagoon cockle File:New Zealand Mud snails.jpgNew Zealand mud snail File:Gammarus roeselii.jpgAmphipods of the Gammaridae family File:Irrawaddy dolphin size.svgIrrawaddy dolphin (compared with an average human) File:Hemigrapsus sanguineus.jpgAsian shore crab File:Carcinus maenas.jpgShore crab File:Fejer cancri 050422 011 tdp.jpgCrab-eating Frog File:Diamondback turtle adult female.jpgDiamondback terrapin See also *Fish migration *Osmoregulation *Stenohaline *Osmoconformer References Category:Aquatic ecology ","title":"Euryhaline"},{"id":"4432405","text":"Knut Steintjønndalen in his workshop 1963 at the age of 76 Knut Knutsson Steintjønndalen (22 November 1887 - 11 June 1969) was a Norwegian Hardanger fiddle maker from Bø in Telemark, Norway.

A solicitor by profession, and a former city councillor, Gerry Peacocke was elected the National Party member for Dubbo, in 1981. He served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for 17 years, before returning to local government, serving one term as Mayor of Dubbo. During his parliamentary career, Peacocke served as a minister in the Greiner and Fahey Coalition Governments. During his time as a minister he had been touted as a possible Deputy Premier and National Party Leader but did not nominate for the National Party leadership when Wal Murray retired from these two positions. Shortly after Murray was succeeded as Deputy Premier and National Party leader by Ian Armstrong in May 1993, Peacocke was one of three ministers (and the only National out of these three) to have been sacked by Premier John Fahey in a Cabinet reshuffle. Peacocke reacted adversely to his sacking and called Premier Fahey \\"a gutless little wimp . . . wide and shallow like a soup bowl\\" for not informing him beforehand of his sacking but this has been denied by Armstrong. Peacocke died in his sleep on 23 May 2013.

Basic principle The basic principle is the same as in interferometry or holography. An interference pattern between two or more coherent light waves is set up and recorded in a recording layer (photoresist). This interference pattern consists of a periodic series of fringes representing intensity minima and maxima. Upon post-exposure photolithographic processing, a photoresist pattern corresponding to the periodic intensity pattern emerges. For 2-beam interference, the fringe-to- fringe spacing or period is given by \\\\frac{\\\\lambda/2}{\\\\sin\\\\bigl(\\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\bigr)}, where is the wavelength and is the angle between the two interfering waves. The minimum period achievable is then half the wavelength. By using 3-beam interference, arrays with hexagonal symmetry can be generated, while with 4 beams, arrays with rectangular symmetry or 3D photonic crystals are generated. With multi wave interference (by inserting a diffuser into the optical path) aperiodic patterns with defined spatial frequency spectrum can be originated. Hence, by superimposing different beam combinations, different patterns are made possible. Coherence requirements For interference lithography to be successful, coherence requirements must be met. First, a spatially coherent light source must be used. This is effectively a point light source in combination with a collimating lens. A laser or synchrotron beam are also often used directly without additional collimation. The spatial coherence guarantees a uniform wavefront prior to beam splitting. Second, it is preferred to use a monochromatic or temporally coherent light source. This is readily achieved with a laser but broadband sources would require a filter. The monochromatic requirement can be lifted if a diffraction grating is used as a beam splitter, since different wavelengths would diffract into different angles but eventually recombine anyway. Even in this case, spatial coherence and normal incidence would still be required. Beam splitter Coherent light must be split into two or more beams prior to being recombined in order to achieve interference. Typical methods for beam splitting are Lloyd´s mirrors, prisms and diffraction gratings. Electron holographic lithography The technique is readily extendible to electron waves as well, as demonstrated by the practice of electron holography. Spacings of a few nanometers or even less than a nanometer have been reported using electron holograms. This is because the wavelength of an electron is always shorter than for a photon of the same energy. The wavelength of an electron is given by the de Broglie relation \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{h}{p}, where h is the Planck constant and p is the electron momentum. For example, a 1 kilo-electron volt (keV) electron has a wavelength of slightly less than 0.04 nm. A 5 eV electron has a wavelength of 0.55 nm. This yields X-ray-like resolution without depositing significant energy. In order to ensure against charging, it must be ensured that electrons can penetrate sufficiently to reach the conducting substrate. A fundamental concern for using low-energy electrons (≪100 eV) with this technique is their natural tendency to repel one another due to Coulomb forces as well as Fermi–Dirac statistics, though electron anti-bunching has been verified only in a single case. Atom holographic lithography The interference of atomic de Broglie waves is also possible provided one can obtain coherent beams of cooled atoms. The momentum of an atom is even larger than for electrons or photons, allowing even smaller wavelengths, per the de Broglie relation. Generally the wavelength will be smaller than the diameter of the atom itself. Uses The benefit of using interference lithography is the quick generation of dense features over a wide area without loss of focus. Seamless diffraction gratings on areas of more than one square meter have been originated by interference lithography. Hence, it is commonly used for the origination of master structures for subsequent micro or nano replication processes (e.g. nanoimprint lithography) or for testing photoresist processes for lithography techniques based on new wavelengths (e.g., EUV or 193 nm immersion). In addition, interfering laser beams of high-power pulsed lasers provides the opportunity of applying a direct treatment of the material's surface (including metals, ceramics and polymers) based on photothermal and/or photochemical mechanisms. Due to the above-mentioned characteristics, this method has been called in this case \\"Direct Laser Interference Patterning\\" (DLIP). Using DLIP, the substrates can be structured directly in one-step obtaining a periodic array on large areas in a few seconds. Such patterned surfaces can be used for different applications including tribology (wear and friction reduction), photovoltaics (increased photocurrent), or biotechnology. Electron interference lithography may be used for patterns which normally take too long for conventional electron beam lithography to generate. The drawback of interference lithography is that it is limited to patterning arrayed features or uniformly distributed aperiodic patterns only. Hence, for drawing arbitrarily shaped patterns, other photolithography techniques are required. In addition, for electron interference lithography non-optical effects, such as secondary electrons from ionizing radiation or photoacid generation and diffusion, cannot be avoided with interference lithography. For instance, the secondary electron range is roughly indicated by the width of carbon contamination (~20 nm) at the surface induced by a focused (2 nm) electron beam. This indicates that the lithographic patterning of 20 nm half-pitch features or smaller will be significantly affected by factors other than the interference pattern, such as the cleanliness of the vacuum.

Daniel Schweizer approaches the phenomenon music with a descriptive objectification of tunes. This provides him a conscious base for his praxis to build himself bridges to the various styles of the symphonic. Quintessential point of his criteria for practical conversion is not primarily historical environment, but musical essence. As of today, the orchestra performs two regular concert series in the Tonhalle in Zurich besides many other performances all around Switzerland and abroad. Daniel Schweizer's international achievements cover concerts at festivals in Spain and Portugal, as well as invitations as guest conductor to orchestras all around the world.

However, the Supreme Court ruled that that system must comply with the constitutional requirements for judicial independence under section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Background Michel Généreux was a corporal in the Canadian Forces. He was charged with drug possession for the purpose of trafficking in violation of section 4 of the Narcotics Control Act and for desertion in violation of section 88(1) of the National Defence Act. In the General Court Martial he was convicted for both offences, which was upheld in the Court Martial Appeal Court. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the General Court Martial was an independent and impartial tribunal under section 11(d) of the Charter. Opinion of the Court The Court examined the requirements for judicial independence established in Valente v. The Queen [1985]. It was found that the judges on the military court did not have sufficient security of tenure or administrative autonomy, which left them vulnerable to interference from the military and government. Consequently, the Court found that the accused's right to an independent and fair tribunal under section 11(d) of the Charter was violated. Aftermath The decision brought about many changes to the military courts. The Government of Canada commissioned recently retired Chief Justice Brian Dickson to write a report to recommend changes to the courts which were eventually incorporated into the 1998 National Defence Act.

The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned. However the position of street boss has somewhat challenged the rank of underboss in the modern era. The position was installed within the Genovese crime family since at least the mid 1960s. It has also been used in the Detroit crime family and the Chicago Outfit. The power of an underboss greatly varies; some are marginal figures, while others are the most powerful individual in the family. Traditionally they run day-to-day affairs of the family. In some crime families, the appointment is for life. If a new boss takes over a family with an existing underboss, that boss may marginalize or even murder the underboss appointed by his predecessor. On the other hand, if a boss is incarcerated, the underboss may become acting boss. As bosses often serve large periods of time in prison, an acting boss will often become the crime family's effective boss. Even with the boss free, sometimes the underboss will gain enough power to become the effective head of the organization, and the boss will become a figurehead. An underboss likely has incriminating information about the boss, and so bosses often appoint people close to them to the underboss position for protection. In most families, the underboss arbitrates many of the disputes. Depending on the seriousness of the problem, he might consult with the boss. Some conflicts are immediately bucked up to the boss. In those cases, the underboss usually sits in and offers his opinion. In either event, the ultimate authority rests with the boss. This sometimes chafes the ego of an ambitious underboss and can lead to problems. An underboss receives monetary compensation in various ways. For example, he may be a partner in several rackets and thus get a cut. In addition, several capos may pass their envelopes through the underboss, who takes a percentage and passes the remainder to the boss. However he makes his illegal earnings, it is a significant enough amount to make his position one of envy, especially when prestige and the possibility of additional advancement are weighed. Sometimes an underboss will have his own crew. Just like the boss of a family, an underboss may also have a right-hand man. This right-hand man may speak in place of an underboss or carry out additional tasks for the underboss.

He was the last American stallion to head the leading sire in North America list for four consecutive years until Bold Ruler did so in 1965. Background He was a chestnut colt bred at Colonel E. Clay's Runnymede Farm. Hanover was by Hindoo from Bourbon Belle by Bonnie Scotland. At the farm's yearling sale in May 1885, Hanover was sold to the Dwyer Brothers Stable for $1,250, where he joined Tremont, a very precocious two-year-old also born in 1884. Racing record Trained by Frank McCabe, at age two, Hanover won all three races he contested: the Hopeful Stakes, the July Stakes, and the Sapling Stakes. With Tremont retired, the Dwyers turned to Hanover as the mainstay for the Dwyer Stable. Hanover started in 27 races at the age of three, racing at distances ranging from four furlongs (800 m) to two miles (3,200 m.), he won 20 times (including the Belmont Stakes by 15 lengths) and finished out of the money only once.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 Before finishing his first two seasons of racing, Hanover had won 17 consecutive races.National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame Retrieved 2010-10-30 After several losses at age four, and an obvious lameness to the right forefoot, Hanover was nerved and given the remainder of the year to recover. At age five, he lost three times in his first four starts, but finished the season with 9 wins from his 17 race starts. For most of his racing career, Hanover raced against older and top-class horses while conceding them large weights. Hanover stopped racing as America's greatest earner with a career total of $118,887. From his 50 starts, he won 32 races, was second 14 times, and finished third twice, only unplaced twice.Thoroughbred Heritage Retrieved 2010-10-30 Stud record After his racing career ended, Hanover was sold to Colonel Milton Young and sent to his McGrathiana Stud farm near Lexington, Kentucky, where he enjoyed a very successful breeding career, becoming the leading sire in the United States for four consecutive years (1885–1889). His offspring include Hall of Fame inductee Hamburg, as well as David Garrick, Halma, Compute, The Commoner, Handspring, Half Time, and Yankee. He was also the damsire of Triple Crown winner Sir Barton. While pawing, Hanover was unable to feel the pain in his 'unnerved' foot, and broke his coffin bone. This led to septicimea, and his condition worsened before he was humanely euthanized in March 1899. Following the creation of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, Hanover was part of the first group of horses inducted in 1955.

History The municipality of Erfjord was created on 1 January 1914, when the municipality of Jelsa was split in two: the western part remained as Jelsa, and the eastern part became Erfjord. Initially, Erfjord had 617 inhabitants. On 1 January 1965, a major municipal consolidation took place due to the recommendations of the Schei Committee. Erfjord municipality ceased to exist and it was merged with the municipalities of Sand and Suldal as well as part of the municipalities of Jelsa and Imsland to form the new (much larger) municipality of Suldal.

The Takeda of Wakasa were a branch of the Takeda of Aki. When Minamoto no Yoritomo was first defeated at Ishibashiyama (1181), Takeda Nobuyoshi (1128–86) was applied for help, and the Takeda sent an army of 25,000 men to support Yoritomo. Takeda Nobumitsu (1162–1248), son of Nobuyoshi, fought against the Taira, against Kiso Yoshinaka (1184), distinguished himself in the Battle of Ichinotani (1184), and was appointed Shugo (Governor) of Kai province. He also fought against the Northern Fujiwara (1189) and against Wada Yoshimori (1213). During the Jōkyū War, he helped the Hōjō, and led 50,000 soldiers as 'Daishogun of the Tosando' , and in reward received the governorship of Aki province (1221). Takeda Nobutake († 1362) was the last Takeda Shugo of the two provinces of Kai and Aki. His elder son Nobunari received Kai and the younger Ujinobu received Aki province. From the Muromachi period until the Sengoku period, the Takeda of Aki ruled Aki province (since 1221), Wakasa province (since 1440), were supporters of the Ashikaga against the Southern Dynasty, and sided with the Hosokawa clan during the Ōnin war (1467–1477). Takeda Nobuhide (1413-1440), eldest son of the Shugo of Aki Takeda Nobushige (1390-1465), helped the 6th shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori against the revolt of Isshiki Yoshitsura (1440) and was rewarded with the governorship of Wakasa province. Takeda Nobukata (1420-1471) inherited the titles of Shugo of Wakasa from his brother Nobuhide who died childless, and that of Shugo of Aki from his father Nobushige. During the Ōnin War (1467-1477) he occupied Tango province that belonged to Isshiki Yoshinao, and was appointed Shugo of Tango (1469) by the bakufu. His brother Takeda Kuninobu (1437-1490) received the titles of Shugo of Aki, Wakasa and Tango provinces, but lost Tango in 1474. Their principal fortress was Kanayama castle, built on the top of the 411 meters of Mount Takeda; a castle built by Takeda Nobumune (1269-1330) in the late Kamakura period, near the present city of Hiroshima. However, clashes with Mōri Motonari of Aki between 1516 and 1541 led to the clan's downfall. The principal line came to an end with the death of Takeda Nobuzane in 1555. The priest Ankokuji Ekei (1537 or 1539-1600) was a grandson ( or a son according to theories) of Takeda Shigekiyo (†1541) of the Aki Takeda. As a close advisor of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, he received in 1585 a fiefdom of 23,000 koku in Iyo Province after the Shikoku campaign. And in 1586, after the conquest of Kyushu, his holdings were expanded to 60,000 koku. At the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), he sided with the western army against Tokugawa Ieyasu, and was condemned to death, along with Ishida Mitsunari and Konishi Yukinaga. During the Tokugawa period, the Harada and the Yamaguchi families, samurai of the Asano clan (daimyō of Hiroshima), descended from the Takeda of Aki.

They are known for playing dark, melodic, doom metal with eastern and gothic influences. History The Eternal are a doom metal/gothic metal band formed in Melbourne in mid-2003 by former members of doom metallers, Cryptal Darkness. The founders were Ryan Buesnel on drums; Chris Burton on guitar; James Hunt on bass guitar; Mark Kelson on guitar and lead vocals; and Chris Stevenson on keyboards. Late that year, they signed a two-album deal with Firebox Records of Finland on the basis of their self-titled extended play. Their debut album for Firebox, The Sombre Light of Isolation, was released worldwide in June 2004. It gained positive reviews from United Kingdom-based magazine, Kerrang!, German-based Metal, Sweden's Metal Only and Lords of Metal in The Netherlands; as well as Australian media Full Strength and Loud!. Darren White (ex-Anathema/The Blood Divine) contributed guest vocals on the track, \\"Remembrance Scars\\". The Sombre Light of Isolation was voted fifth best Australian release of 2005 by listeners of Australian national radio, Triple J's Full Metal Racket, while it was nominated as second best Australian album by the presenter. The band was listed in Kerrang! magazine's '50 Bands You Need to Know Right Now'. The Eternal completed two music videos, \\"Down\\" and \\"Crimson Sacrifice\\". In support of the album, they undertook the Sombre Light Tour of Australia, Hong Kong, UK and continental Europe including Finland, in late 2004. In 2005 Sombre Visions, which focuses on that tour, was released as a DVD on their own label, Sombre Light. It also included a documentary on the group and promotional videos. Upon return immediately set about writing material for their second album, Sleep of Reason. Recorded early in 2005, ‘Sleep of Reason’ extends The Eternal's sound from their debut work. It was produced and recorded by Endel Rivers at Palm Studios in Melbourne, and mastered by Mika Jussila (Amorphis, Nightwish, Therion) at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki. The album's sleeve-art was created by Travis Smith (Opeth, Katatonia, Anathema) based on the etching 'El sueño de la razon produce monstruos' by Francisco de Goya. Videos for ‘Everlasting’, ‘A Soul Undone’ and ‘Hollow Inside’ followed the release of the album. In 2006, The Eternal landed the Australian national support slot for Finnish rockers HIM, which coincided with the Australian release of ‘Sleep of Reason’. These successful shows were shortly followed by six shows supporting renowned Swedish death/progressive metal band Opeth on their ‘Ghost Reveries’ Australian tour. After touring Australia extensively for the release of ‘Sleep of Reason’ and playing to well over 15,000 people in their home country, the band set off for their second tour of Europe in May 2007. The tour saw the band return to Portugal, Germany, Hungary, Belgium and the Netherlands. On their return home, the band went about completing and compiling three years worth of demo material for what would soon become ‘Kartika’. The Eternal's 2008 album ‘Kartika,’ may be seen as the band's most diverse and ambitious album to date. Guests on the album include Duncan Patterson (ex-Anathema, Antimatter and Íon) on Mandolin, Nicholas Albanis (Dandelion Wine) on Hammered Dulcimer and Russian songstress Emily A. Saaen to name a few. ’Kartika’ was produced between December 2007 and May 2008, recorded at several studios in Australia including Mixmasters Studios, Adelaide and Palm Studios in Melbourne. It was mixed in Tallinn, Estonia by Endel Rivers at Palm Studios II and mastered at Crystal Mastering, Melbourne, Australia by John Ruberto. January 2009 saw the departure of co-founding member Chris Stevenson for personal reasons. Chris stated 'The Eternal was basically my life for a good 5 years and I loved every single moment of it! It was also an extremely gruelling experience, which at times took its toll on me on a personal level'. The band will continue on as a 3 piece and at this point have no intention to find a replacement. The Eternal completed an extensive world tour in June 2009. The tour took the band through Australia, Japan, Europe, America, Canada and Mexico. In November 2009, the band commenced work on their fourth album Under a New Sun, it was produced by Jeff Martin, former singer of The Tea Party. The album saw The Eternal experimenting more with the rock and eastern elements of their sound. Following the release of 'Under A New Sun' the band completed an Australian and New Zealand Tour. In 2011, the band enlisted second guitar player Brad Cook, a long time fixture in the Melbourne scene. The addition of Brad to the line-up helped to refocus the band and encourage them to commence work on the band's fifth studio album, When The Circle of Light Begins to Fade (October 2013). Martin Curtis-Powell (Cradle of Filth, My Dying Bride, Anathema) also stepped in to contribute keyboards on the album. Following the release of When The Circle of Light Begins to Fade the band toured Australia to celebrate their 10-year anniversary and also released a free E.P entitled Sombre Light 2014 - 10th Anniversary E.P which contained re- recordings of material from their debut album The Sombre Light of Isolation. This release was also follow by national tours with Anathema, Amorphis and Uriah Heep. The band release Circle of Live live album/DVD in March 2015 which was also recorded on the band's 10th Anniversary tour in 2013. The band parted ways with guitarist Brad Cook in late 2015 and Martin Curtis-Powell has since become a full-time member of the band. In March 2016, The Eternal entered Kelsonic Studios (with singer/guitarist Mark Kelson handling production) to record their 6th full-length album. The album, titled Waiting for the Endless Dawn was released in August 2018.

Name  There are two (or maybe more) theories as how the village received its name. Some think it was named for Captain Hogg, Commander of Fort Michell. Some others think that it is because one of the three peaks that overlook the village, when seen from a certain angle, resembles a Hog's Back (A hog's back is a geological term describing this particular rock formation).  History  The earliest known written reference to 'Hogsback' was found in the journal of the painter Thomas Baines, who passed the 'Hogs Back' while on his travels deeper inside South Africa in 1848. Besides the 'Hogsback', the highest peak in the area is the 1 954 m Gaika's Kop. The nearby Xhosa tribes called the surrounding area Qabimbola (meaning 'red clay on the face') as the surrounding clay was used for face painting. Gaika's Kop was one of the Xhosa strongholds. British troops were later stationed here and a number of forts were built to guard the border with the Xhosa. One of these forts was Fort Michell, named after Colonel Michell of the Warwickshire regiment, who was at one point in charge of troops in the area. The name has since changed to Fort Mitchell. The outline of Fort Michell, and the first road from Fort Hare can still be seen. The conflict between the British and Xhosa continued further north and a small settlement began to grow. Some of the first inhabitants of Hogsback were Summerton, Odendaal and Booysens. Thomas Summerton, a gardener from Oxford, has a legacy that survives in the local gardens and his attempts to re-create the English countryside. This can be seen in apple orchards, avenues lined with hazelnut, berry fruits and the flowering plants that have spread throughout the surrounding area. European flowers, bushes and trees include rhododendrons, azaleas, fruits and berries. He named his farm Cherrie Orchard and also built a furrow – Summerton's furrow – to carry water from a stream on Tor Doone. In the 1880s, Collins built a small hotel, called the Hogsback Hydro, of which later became the Hogsback Inn. Hunterstoun, the private estate of David Hunter, in 1910. Hunter was the honorary secretary and treasurer of the Lovedale Institution and the Victoria College near Alice. Forestry began in 1883 with a survey to determine the best areas for planting. The Hogsback pass was opened in 1932. Hobbiton-on-Hogsback was started in 1946 as a holiday camp for children who could not afford to go on holidays and with the aid of several organisations and private donations, had grown to an outdoor education facility for underprivileged children. There was also a shop, the Handy Log Cabin, situated in the grounds of Arminel. At the turn of the century, local farmers and townsfolk started to build holiday homes here and its charms became more widely known. The cottages were mostly of wattle and daub with thatched roofs. A rule was also made in regard to the size of the plots, namely that each one had to be at least two morgen.www.hogsbackinfo.co.za/history/  Geography and tourism  The area is known for indigenous forests, waterfalls and trout fishing. The large gardens in the surrounding area also include exotic plants from all parts of the Earth, and it is a destination and tourist attraction among both international and South African tourists.http://www.hogsback.co.za/ Apart from 'the Hogsback', the tallest peak in the area is the 1 954 m Gaika's Kop.  Hiking and walking trails  There are a number of hiking routes and walks that take walkers through the forests, up mountains, past waterfalls and to viewing points and views of the area.http://www.hogsbackcottage.com General information on Hogsback such as maps of walks, hiking and mountain bike trails are available for purchase from the Hogsback Tourist Office located near the entrance of the village. These trails vary from short easy walks to trails taking 3–4 hours and longer. Hogsback hiking trails include:http://www.hogsbackcottage.com/Hogsback/HogsbackHikingAndWalkingTrails/ The Labyrinth at the Edge, The 39 Steps Falls and Arboretum, Madonna and Child Falls, Kettlespout Falls, The Three Hogs, Tyumy Pools walk, The Three Waterfall Trail, The Bluff Walk, The Military Path, The Sunset loop, The Big Tree and The Art and Craft Trail.  Tolkien  The Amatola Forest in the Hogsback area is often claimed, (but cannot be true since Tolkien left South Africa when he was three years old) as J. R. R. Tolkien's inspiration for The Lord of the Rings, in particular for his fictional forest of Mirkwood. The link between Tolkien and Hogsback would seem to be a back formation from the establishment in 1947 of Hobbiton on Hogsback,Hobbiton on Hogsback a holiday and educational camp for underprivileged children. This was ten years after the publication of The Hobbit which was a huge success and which would have inspired the camp's founders as they set up in such an evocatively forested area.  Climate  Hogsback has a cool Oceanic Climate (Köppen Cfb), which compares similarly to the climate of England. It has a climate range from as low as 3.5 °C in July to as high as 34.9 °C in January. Hogsback receives an average annual precipitation of 974mm. Hogsback receives most of its rainfall in summer, often accompanied by thunderstorms.  Location  Hogsback is located roughly 30 km from Alice. Overall, it is in the central-southern part of South Africa, in the centre of the Eastern Cape province, and is roughly halfway between the town of Alice and the village of Cathcart. Nearby towns include Seymour to the west, Fort Hare and Alice to the south, Cathcart, Whittlesea and the Waterdown Dam to the north and Keiskammahoek to the east. However, travel east and west of the town is rare because there is little infrastructure and ridges/mountains to these sides.  Transportation  The village is located on the R345, that runs from Fort Hare up to Cathcart. This is very much the only route of communication for the village because the small unpaved roads to the west and east are dangerous and not recommended for motor traversing.  Religion  St Patrick's on the Hill is a small chapel consisting of two combined rondavels, a neat thatched roof, above which rises a single cross. The church also boasts a 'bright' garden, which is full of rhododendrons and azaleas. There is a stone arch with a brass bell that stands as a memorial for the Revd Dr Bride Dixon, first woman priest in South Africa, and doctor on the mountain for many years.http://www.hogsback.co.za/features/st_patricks.htm – About St. Patrick's chapel The chapel was built in 1935 and is a regular place of worship, and although it is officially part of the Anglican Diocese of Grahamstown, the church is open to people of all Christian denominations such as Presbyterians, Methodists, Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) and Anglicans. The chapel began when Kenneth Hobart Houghton, the owner of the property conceived of the idea to give to his wife a special place to worship. It was first designed as a single rondavel and in time as the local congregation grew, it became necessary to extend it. The second rondavel which gives it its characteristic butternut shape was added in 1992. Currently the chapel is open 24 hours a day.

In Brazil, he is also known as Marcelinho Paraíba, which refers to the state in which he was born, as a means to distinguish himself from other players also called \\"Marcelinho\\". He was arguably one of the best playmakers in the Bundesliga because of his extravagant skills that include his visionary passing, abundance of tricks, and his world class technique. Career Born in Campina Grande, Paraíba, Marcelinho Paraiba began his career in Campinense, where he won two league titles there. Between 1994 and 1995, he played for Santos. Two years later, however, he made his breakthrough at São Paulo, where he won two Paulistões before being sold to Marseille. He only spent a year in France, and in 2001 he returned to Brazil to play for Grêmio, where he began to experience the pinnacle of his career. At that time, Marcelinho Paraiba was called \\"Marcelinho Paraúcho\\" by Gremistas, because of his passage in the team. He became champion and top scorer of the Campeonato Gaúcho, and champion of the Copa do Brasil, where he scored a goal in the second game in the final against Corinthians, but did not play in the league that year because before the tournament, he signed a five-year contract with Hertha BSC. Marcelinho played for Hertha from 2001 to 2006. He is ranked among the most important players in the association's history and there Marcelinho was known as a technically talented player, serving as a playmaker and leader while performing in both the midfield and forward area. In addition, he carried the responsibility of executing the free kicks, corner kicks, and penalty kicks of the club. The personal trademarks of this extravagant football player are his usually remarkable shoes and his often multicoloured hair. He was capped fives times for the Brazil national football team, for which he scored once. At the beginning of the 2006–07 season, he arbitrarily extended his off-season vacation by nine days, which led to some slight tension with the Hertha association management. After Marcelinho had expressed himself, in the following the days, contradictory statements as to whether he wanted to remain at Hertha or not, he ended his term with them, signing a three-year contract with Turkish club Trabzonspor for approximately 2.5 million euros. In August 2008, Marcelinho Paraíba returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo. On 6 March 2009, Coritiba signed the forward on a free transfer until the end of the year, as Marcelinho terminated his contract with Flamengo. After the relegation of Coritiba, he re-signed for São Paulo on 18 December 2009. On 9 August 2010 he was loaned to Sport till the end of the 2010 season and his contract was extended to the end of the 2011 season. Marcelinho subsequently represented Sport, Boa Esporte, Fortaleza, Internacional de Lages (two stints), Joinville, Oeste, Ypiranga de Erechim Treze and Portuguesa. Retirement On 15 March 2020, he made his last game as a professional player, playing for Perilima against Centro Sportivo Paraibano for the eighth round of the 2020 Campeonato Paraibano.

The group commenced operations on 2 June 1944. The 491st attacked airfields, bridges, and coastal defenses both preceding and during the invasion of Normandy. After D-Day, the unit concentrated its attacks on strategic objectives in Germany, striking communications centers, oil refineries, storage depots, industrial areas, shipyards, and other targets in such places as Berlin, Hamburg, Kassel, Cologne, Gelsenkirchen, Bielefeld, Hannover, and Magdeburg. On one occasion the 491st attacked the headquarters of the German General Staff at Zossen, Germany. On 15 August 1944, the 95th Combat wing was broken up and the 491st was moved to RAF North Pickenham. =1409th Army Air Force Base Unit= After the 491st moved, a small number of B-24's were still assigned to Metfield, under the command of the European Division of Air Transport, United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF). These aircraft were used by the 1409th Army Air Force Base Unit, a classified unit engaged in clandestine transport operations to Sweden, flying out special materials and ferrying personnel. The 1409th operated from Metfield until the end of the war operating the B-24s, as well as Douglas C-47 Skytrains and Douglas C-54 Skymasters. The unit also used RAF Leuchars in Scotland as an advanced base. On 4 March 1945 during \\"Operation Gisela\\" RAF Metfield was strafed by a Junkers Ju 88(G-6) of the Luftwaffe, killing one man in the control tower. The aircraft crashed just south of the airfield, after attempting to attack an inbound B24, with its upward firing cannon. =Metfield explosion= On 15 July 1944 at 7:30pm there was a major explosion at the Metfield bomb dump. Some soldiers from the 2218th Quartermaster Truck Company arrived to deliver the bombs. When they arrived they were impatient to discover that soldiers at the dump who operated the hoist were on a meal break, and decided to unload the bombs without the crane. However these bombs were more sensitive than previous munitions: when they used a previously successful technique to drop the bombs off the back of the truck, one bomb landed on another and they both exploded. A chain reaction led to 1,200 tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs exploding, shaking the countryside for a radius of several miles. Six men were killed. Three soldiers, Privates Donald P. Adkins, Donald L. Hurley and Steve W. Suchey are memorialised at Cambridge American Cemetery as missing in action. 5 B-24's in nearby hardstands were severely damaged beyond repair. An additional six aircraft were severely damaged. There is an eyewitness account of being blown flat 3.5 miles away from the explosion. After the explosion, an extended loop road was built to by-pass the crater left by the explosion. The crater subsequently became a dump for all manner of discarded items. Royal Air Force use In May 1945, RAF Metfield was closed and returned to the RAF. It was subsequently abandoned, but remained in the hands of the Air Ministry. Current use Memorial plaque to U.S.A.A.F. to 353rd Fighter Group and 491st bomb group Metfield was not used by the Air Ministry after the Second World War ended and for years it sat abandoned and empty. In 1964 and 1965, the airfield and support buildings were sold to private individuals. Metfield was returned to agricultural use; however, the site of the bomb dump explosion could be seen for many years as a water-filled lake. When the lake was cleaned out, all types of discarded equipment was found, including several unexploded bombs. Indeed, ordnance that was tossed into the air during the bomb dump explosion has been found over the years in the fields surrounding Metfield. Pieces of metal from the exploded bombs has been found scattered over the area to the present day. In the late 1960s the main runways, taxiways and parking aprons were mostly torn up or turned into single lane agricultural roads. Sadly, very little evidence of the airfield can be seen today. Only a few brick buildings, deteriorating Quonset (Nissen) huts, and some concrete aircraft taxiways remain.

History=Construction Raydon airfield was constructed by the 833rd and 862nd Aviation Engineer Battalions. Although only ever used by fighters, Raydon airfield was constructed as a standard Class A bomber airfield. As a result, its main concrete runway was approximately 6000 ft long with two intersecting concrete runways of 4200 ft. Two T-2 type hangars were built at opposite ends of the airfield and 52 concrete dispersal points were located around the perimeter track. Accommodation for over 2800 personnel was built to the south east of the airfield. USAAF use Raydon was primarily a fighter station for the Eighth and Ninth United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). During the Second World War it was known as USAAF Station 157. =357th Fighter Group= North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang Serial 43-12123 of the 364th Fighter Squadron. The first American occupants of Raydon was the 357th Fighter Group, moving in from Casper AAF, Wyoming on 30 November 1943. Operational squadrons of the 357th were: * 362d Fighter Squadron (G4) * 363d Fighter Squadron (B6) * 364th Fighter Squadron (C5) One pilot with the 357th was a Lt. Charles 'Chuck' Yeager. When the group arrived at Raydon, it was assigned as part of the Ninth Air Force. On 19 December the group received their first fighter, a single North American P-51B Mustang. =358th Fighter Group= Republic P-47D-30-RA Thunderbolt Serial No. 44-33240 of the 356th Fighter Squadron The 358th Fighter Group moved to RAF Raydon from RAF Leiston on 31 January 1944. The 358th was initially assigned to the 66th Fighter Wing, at Sawston Hall, Cambridge, then transferred to the Ninth Air Force on 1 February 1944 in exchange for the 357th FG. Operational squadrons of the 358th were: * 365th Fighter Squadron (CH) * 366th Fighter Squadron (IA) * 367th Fighter Squadron (CP) Group markings were red, yellow and red spinners, with a 12-inch red and yellow check band around the cowling behind the spinner. Aircraft of the 357th were Republic P-47D Thunderbolts. At RAF Raydon the group's mission was to attack enemy communications and fly escort missions with the light bomb groups of the 9th AF. On 13 April 1944 the 358th was transferred to RAF High Halden. On 19 March 1944 a badly damaged Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress landed at Raydon due to Raydon being the first airfield the crew came across. The B-17 was B-17 #42-31968 LN:D \\"Miss Irish\\" of the 350th Bomb Squadron of the 100th Bomb Group. The aircraft's nose art was a black four leafed clover. The B-17 took a direct 88mm flak hit while on a \\"milk run\\" (easy mission) over France. The shell blew a large hole in the radio compartment and the radio operator was blown out of the aircraft. The aircraft was severely weakened around the place of impact so the remaining crew decided to land at Raydon. The B-17 was salvaged. =353d Fighter Group= North American P-51D-10-NA MustangSerial 44-14593 of the 351st Fighter Squadron.

It was originally named \\"Alabama Rammer Jammer\\" and assigned to Lt Arthur C Cundy (KIA 11 March 1945). Replacing the 9th AF 358th FG was the 353rd Fighter Group, moving in from RAF Metfeld in April 1944. The 353d was assigned to the 66th Fighter Wing, at Sawston Hall, Cambridge. The 353rd arrived at a very dirty Raydon airfield as the 358th had not cleaned after leaving. Operational squadrons of the 353d were: * 350th Fighter Squadron (LH) * 351st Fighter Squadron (YJ) * 352d Fighter Squadron (SX) Group markings were black, yellow, black, yellow spinners, with a 48-inch black and yellow check band around the cowling to the end of the exhaust stubs. In October 1944, the group converted to the P-51 \\"Mustang\\". The 353d flew combat missions until the end of April 1945. After the end of hostilities, the group trained and prepared for transfer to the Pacific Theater. After the end of the Second World War, in September, the group left Raydon and transferred back to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey where it was inactivated on 18 October 1945. Whilst the 353rd occupied Raydon airfield, a B-17 Flying Fortress belonging to the 91st Bomb Group made an emergency landing at Raydon on 3 November 1944. The B-17 - a member of the 324th Bomb Squadron - went by the name of \\"Little Patches\\" and was piloted by 2nd Lt Charles Buchanan on a mission to Merseburg upon which it sustained serious flak damage. A Consolidated B-24H Liberator of the 34th Bomb Group also made an emergency landing at Raydon on 26 June 1944. RAF Fighter Command use After the Americans left, Raydon was transferred back to RAF Fighter Command on 20 December 1945. The airfield remained under RAF control but was not used for any flying units. In 1952, a small part of the airfield was sold for agricultural use, and the station was closed on 8 August 1958. During 1960/62 the Air Ministry sold the remaining airfield parts of RAF Raydon to agricultural interests, retaining most of the technical site for storage of emergency vehicles by the Home Office. They were given up and sold in the 1980s. Current use Raydon is one of the more complete Second World War USAAF airfield (bases) in East Anglia that was not also used by the United States Air Force during the Cold War. After the end of military control, Raydon was converted into Notley Industrial Park. The buildings that remain are largely unaltered in appearance, including the old technical site. Two T-2 hangars are in very good condition, one used by a farmer and the other used for car storage. Some of the taxiways and part of the main runway are still intact. The rifle butts are also extant, although heavily overgrown with foliage. Unfortunately the control tower and many concrete sections of the airfield were removed in the 1960s, being used to construct the A12 highway. Raydon has been the scene of some reported paranormal incidents, one being the sighting of an American MP with his dog, still patrolling the airfield.

With many political organisations banned and leaders in prison or detained without trial, the campaign was led by a broad cross-section of leaders, including religious leaders, community leaders and trade union activists, sometimes operating under the banner of the Mass Democratic Movement. Previous protests were met with force by the police. A protest in the centre of Cape Town 10 days earlier was dispersed by a water cannon dispensing purple dye, prompting the slogan the purple shall govern. More than 20 people were killed in the vicinity of Cape Town on the election day of 6 September 1989, and at a memorial service for these deaths, Tutu called for a wider protest march to take place the following week. The march gathered wide support, including from groups not usually active in protest marches, including businesses and white opposition parties. State response Earlier in 1989, the State President P.W. Botha had been replaced by F.W. de Klerk as head of the ruling National Party. De Klerk led his party to victory in the whites-only election on 6 September and was due to be inaugurated as State President a week after the march. The march polarised support within the government. The security establishment opposed it, but De Klerk decided that the march would not be broken up by force to prevent a violent confrontation and the associated negative publicity. Fearing a \\"Velvet Revolution\\" of the kind which was occurring in Eastern Europe, De Klerk capitulated to demands from the anti-apartheid movement. This signalled a significant change from the Botha era and lead to concessions that ushered in the transition to democracy. The march The march began near Cape Town's St George's Cathedral and proceeded down Adderley Street, ending at the Grand Parade. The crowd was led by the city's mayor and a group of religious leaders and marshalls from the United Democratic Front. Unlike previous protests, the police were not present to confront the marchers, and the march went peacefully. Outside the Cape Town City Hall, Tutu gave a speech referring to South Africa as a rainbow country. Aftermath The success of the march and the fact that the police refused to enforce the ban against such gatherings under the then State of Emergency led to further marches in many parts of the country, often instigated by religious leaders. Liberal commentator Allister Sparks regards the march as the beginning of the normalisation of South African politics and September 1989 as the culmination of De Klerk's conversion to negotiations. A few months later, South Africa entered a new political era when De Klerk unbanned the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations and freed Nelson Mandela and other prisoners. Formal negotiations to end apartheid began soon afterwards.

The 65 kg (143 lb), US$40 million instrument was built under the direction of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. It consists of a 0.5 m (19.7 in) aperture reflecting telescope, the largest so far of any deep space mission, which allows it to take pictures of Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1 foot), resolving objects below a meter across. HiRISE has imaged Mars exploration rovers on the surface, including the Opportunity rover and the ongoing Curiosity mission. History Crop of one of the first images of Mars from the HiRISE camera In the late 1980s, of Ball Aerospace & Technologies began planning the kind of high-resolution imaging needed to support sample return and surface exploration of Mars. In early 2001 he teamed up with Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona to propose such a camera for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and NASA formally accepted it November 9, 2001. Ball Aerospace was given the responsibility to build the camera and they delivered HiRISE to NASA on December 6, 2004 for integration with the rest of the spacecraft. It was prepared for launch on board the MRO on August 12, 2005, to the cheers of the HiRISE team who were present. Artist's rendition of HiRISE at Mars During the cruise phase of MRO, HiRISE took multiple test shots including several of the Moon and the Jewel Box cluster. These images helped to calibrate the camera and prepare it for taking pictures of Mars. On March 10, 2006, MRO achieved Martian orbit and primed HiRISE to acquire some initial images of Mars. The instrument had two opportunities to take pictures of Mars (the first was on March 24, 2006) before MRO entered aerobraking, during which time the camera was turned off for six months. It was turned on successfully on September 27, and took its first high-resolution pictures of Mars on September 29. On October 6, 2006 HiRISE took the first image of Victoria Crater, a site which is also under study by the Opportunity rover. In February 2007 seven detectors showed signs of degradation, with one IR channel almost completely degraded, and one other showing advanced signs of degradation. The problems seemed to disappear when higher temperatures were used to take pictures with the camera. As of March, the degradation appeared to have stabilized, but the underlying cause remained unknown. Subsequent experiments with the Engineering Model (EM) at Ball Aerospace provided definitive evidence for the cause: contamination in the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) which results in flipping bits to create the apparent noise or bad data in the images, combined with design flaws leading to delivery of poor analog waveforms to the ADCs. Further work showed that the degradation can be reversed by heating the ADCs. On 2007-10-03, HiRISE was turned toward Earth, and took a picture of it and the Moon. In a full-resolution color image, Earth was 90 pixels across and the Moon was 24 pixels across from a distance of 142 million km. On May 25, 2008, HiRISE imaged NASA's Mars Phoenix Lander parachuting down to Mars. It was the first time that one spacecraft imaged the final descent of another spacecraft onto a planetary body. By 2010, HiRISE had imaged about one percent of Mars's surface and by 2016 the coverage was around 2.4%. It was designed to capture smaller areas at high resolution—other instruments scan much more area to find things like fresh impact craters. On April 1, 2010, NASA released the first images under the HiWish program in which the public suggested places for HiRISE to photograph. One of the eight locations was Aureum Chaos. The first image below gives a wide view of the area. The next two images are from the HiRISE image. The following three images relate to the first images taken under the HiWish program.

File:54850 1900ridgesclosecolor.jpgClose, color view of ridges, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Purpose MOC aboard MGS The HiRISE camera is designed to view surface features of Mars in greater detail than has previously been possible. It has provided a closer look at fresh martian craters, revealing alluvial fans, viscous flow features and ponded regions of pitted materials containing breccia clast. This allows for the study of the age of Martian features, looking for landing sites for future Mars landers, and in general, seeing the Martian surface in far greater detail than has previously been done from orbit. By doing so, it is allowing better studies of Martian channels and valleys, volcanic landforms, possible former lakes and oceans, sand dune fields such as Hagal and Nili Patera, and other surface landforms as they exist on the Martian surface. The general public is allowed to request sites for the HiRISE camera to capture (see HiWish). For this reason, and due to the unprecedented access of pictures to the general public, shortly after they have been received and processed, the camera has been termed \\"The People's Camera\\". The pictures can be viewed online, downloaded, or with the free HiView software. Design Earth and Moon from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter taken by HiRISE HiRISE was designed to be a high resolution camera from the beginning. It consists of a large mirror, as well as a large CCD camera. Because of this, it achieves a resolution of 1 microradian, or 0.3 meter at a height of 300 km. (For comparison purposes, satellite images on Google Mars are available to 1 meter.\\"Google Earth FAQ\\" Google Earth Website.) It can image in three color bands, 400–600 nm (blue-green or B-G), 550–850 nm (red) and 800–1,000 nm (near infrared or NIR). HiRISE incorporates a 0.5-meter primary mirror, the largest optical telescope ever sent beyond Earth's orbit. The mass of the instrument is 64.2 kg.Mission to Mars: the HiRISE camera on- board MRO, Focal plane arrays for space telescopes III, 27–28 August 2007, San Diego, California, USA Red color images are at 20,048 pixels wide (6 km in a 300 km orbit), and blue-green and NIR are at 4,048 pixels wide (1.2 km). These are gathered by 14 CCD sensors, . HiRISE's onboard computer reads out these lines in time with the orbiter's ground speed, meaning the images are potentially unlimited in height. Practically this is limited by the onboard computer's () memory capacity. The nominal maximum size of red images (compressed to 8 bits per pixel) is about 20,000 × 126,000 pixels, or 2520 megapixels and 4,000 × 126,000 pixels (504 megapixels) for the narrower images of the B-G and NIR bands. A single uncompressed image uses up to 28 Gbit. However, these images are transmitted compressed,with a typical max size of 11.2 Gigabits. These images are released to the general public on the HiRISE website via a new format called JPEG 2000. To facilitate the mapping of potential landing sites, HiRISE can produce stereo pairs of images from which the topography can be measured to an accuracy of 0.25 meter.

The start of orbit is located at the equator on the descending side (night side) of the orbit. A target code of 0000 refers to the start of orbit. The target code increases in value along the orbit track ranging from 0000 to 3595. This convention allows the file name ordering to be time sequential. The first three digits refers to the number of whole degrees from the start of orbit, the fourth digit refers to the fractional degrees rounded to the nearest 0.5 degrees. Values greater than 3595 identify observations as off-Mars or special observations. Examples of target code: * 0000 – planned observation at the equator on descending side of orbit. * 0900 – planned observation at the south pole. * 1800 – planned observation at the equator on the ascending side (day side) of the orbit. * 2700 – planned observation at the north pole.

The band has released three full-length albums, numerous singles and EPs and were part of the original 1995 Vans Warped Tour line-up. They are perhaps best known by wider audiences for their song \\"Chewbacca\\", which was featured on the soundtrack to Kevin Smith's 1994 independent film Clerks. They are also known for the song \\"Up & Down\\", which was performed in 2007 on the Nick Jr. children's show Yo Gabba Gabba! Biography=Early years (1989–1994) The original line-up of Supernova formed in Costa Mesa, California in 1989, consisting of bassist/vocalist Art Mitchell, guitarist/vocalist Hayden Thais and drummer Dave Collins. Noted for their energetic live shows and outlandish science fiction-themed aesthetic in which the members claimed to be aliens from a distant planet. the band quickly became a popular draw within the Orange County punk scene, independently releasing a slew of 7\\" singles and EPs throughout the early 1990s and receiving regular airplay on local and college radio. In 1994, Supernova received significant exposure when their song \\"Chewbacca\\" - a mostly instrumental piece featuring the band members growling like Wookiees - was featured in the successful independent comedy Clerks and its respective soundtrack. That same year, however, Thais departed from the group's line-up, later joining the popular surf rock outfit Man or Astro-man? and fronting the robot-themed New Wave rock band Servotron. Indie breakthrough (1995–2005) After hiring Jodey Lawrence as their new guitarist, Supernova recorded their debut studio album Ages 3 & Up in 1995 on Amphetamine Reptile Records. The release of the album was followed by extensive touring as the band joined the line-up of the inaugural Vans Warped Tour in 1995, spending the remainder of the decade regularly touring with such notable Orange County bands like The Aquabats and Reel Big Fish, as well as opening for bands including The Buzzcocks, Dick Dale, The Presidents of the United States of America and The Supersuckers. In 1998, Supernova released their second album Rox, accompanied by another appearance on the Warped Tour in 1999. Rox was soon followed by Pop as a Weapon in 2001, a compilation album collecting all of the band's early vinyl releases. In 2003, OC Weekly ranked Supernova No. 86 in their feature \\"The 129 Greatest OC Bands Ever\\". The reviewer described the band as \\"part of the wave of bands that brought the spotlight to OC for a bit\\", summarizing them as \\"one of the first and best of the slew of outer-space-themed rock bands\\". In an AllMusic review of Pop as a Weapon, reviewer Ned Raggett called Supernova \\"one of the most underrated acts of the '90s\\", calling their songs \\"[q]uick, brisk, to-the-point, and hilarious as all hell\\" and writing \\"Quite why they never connected with more folks like the equally wonderful Man or Astro-man?...will have to remain one of the many cosmic mysteries of music\\". Resurgence (2006–2009) In the mid-2000s, after several years of relative inactivity, Supernova experienced a resurgence of popularity after embarking on several tours with The Aquabats, following their own commercial resurgence with the 2005 album Charge!!. In 2007, Supernova appeared on two episodes of Yo Gabba Gabba!, a popular children's television series developed by Aquabats singer Christian Jacobs, where they performed their song \\"Up & Down\\" and featured Lawrence in a segment playing electric guitar with Aquabats guitarist Eagle \\"Bones\\" Falconhawk. Following the release of the live 7\\" ¡Diga Queso!, the band's first recorded material in six years, Supernova played a number of high-profile festivals, including the 2006 and 2008 Bamboozle fests and the 2007 Warped Tour. In August 2008, Jodey Lawrence left Supernova; in a MySpace blog announcing his departure, the band facetiously explained that Lawrence had decided to become a \\"full-time Earthling\\". Former Aquabats guitarist and longtime Supernova fan Corey Pollock was recruited as a temporary replacement, though immediately following his first show with the band, it was announced that Pollock would become a permanent member, retaining his Aquabats stage name of \\"Chainsaw\\". Current era (2010–present) Since 2007, Supernova had announced plans to record a new studio album, with at least two new songs, \\"Poodle\\" and \\"Whiffle Bat\\", having been written and performed at live shows. Following Lawrence's departure, however, the band mentioned wanting to re-write the material with Pollock, though plans for the album were dropped as the band quickly slipped into an unexplained hiatus, performing their last show as \\"Supernova\\" on January 29, 2010. On June 16, 2012, Mitchell, Collins and guitarist \\"Ben Nova\\" performed an all-Supernova set at the Tiki Bar in Costa Mesa under the name \\"Gum Fighters\\". There was no further information on Supernova's status until October 28, 2014, when the band released an EP entitled No Data on Amazon.com, featuring demos and various recordings from the cancelled studio album. On April 26, 2015, Supernova - with Lawrence back on guitar - performed as part of a benefit show at The Boathouse in Costa Mesa. On July 2, 2016, Supernova - Art, Dave, Jo - will perform at SATURDAY IN THE PARK festival in Sioux City, IA, as well as a club show at Marty's Tap in Sioux City on July 1, 2016. Band mythology and live shows Supernova in spaceman regalia. Similar to such bands as The Aquabats, The Phenomenauts or Servotron, one defining aspect of Supernova is the fictional mythology which accompanies the band's outer space theme. According to the band's biography and press kits, the origins of Supernova begin on the distant planet of Cynot 3, a world inhabited by kind aliens who spend their days relaxing and searching for valuable tin foil. One day in 1989, their sun exploded in a supernova and the Cynotions were forced to flee the planet. Three native Cynotians - Art, Hank and Dave (later retconned to include Jo in hybernation phase) - escape just in time with their rock n' roll-powered tour bus spaceship and crash land in Costa Mesa, where they decide to start their very own rock band and use their popularity to convince Earth kids to bring them precious tin foil. In 1995, Supernova produced a 25-minute television pilot starring themselves based on the band's mythology. Entitled Last In Space: A Show for Kids?, the pilot was an adult- oriented children's show chronicling the trio's adventures within their space van, complete with musical numbers. The pilot ultimately failed to generate network interest, but copies of the pilot were regularly sold on VHS at the band's shows up until their hiatus. Live performances While not as elaborately staged as other theatrical bands like The Aquabats, Supernova's live shows were characterized by a heavy science fiction-themed visual aesthetic. The band members most often entered the stage wearing shiny silver jumpsuits and custom-made space helmets, removing the latter to frequently reveal bizarre hairstyles or facial hair. Tin foil was a crucial element of the band's style: both Collins' drum kit and Mitchell's bass guitar were covered in foil, and the band would hand out sheets to audience members so they could create their own accessories. Fans were encouraged to wear tin foil to Supernova shows - with most venues offering ticket discounts for those who did - and, at the insistence of the band, attempt to pelt the members in the face with foil balls during the show. Mitchell often incited mass foil attacks by frequently making the often-disputed claim that he had never been successfully hit in the face. Rock Star dispute In 2006, CBS premiered the second season of their reality television series Rock Star, in which contestants compete to become the lead singer of a new band featuring established musicians. The band which was created for the season, including musicians Tommy Lee, Jason Newsted and Gilby Clark, was to be named \\"Supernova\\". On 27 June 2006, the members of the Orange County Supernova filed a lawsuit against CBS, Mark Burnett and Rockstar Entertainment, seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as trademark protection of the \\"Supernova\\" name and the destruction of all Rock Star materials bearing the name \\"Supernova\\". One of the primary pieces of evidence was a MySpace message from Rock Star producer Butch Walker in which he notes that the defendants had been informed of the existence of a prior Supernova, but decided to proceed anyway.\\"Supernova Sue 'Rock Star: Supernova' Producers, Bandmembers\\", Chris Harris, MTV News, posted July 11, 2006, accessed July 18, 2006. The defendants did not believe that the plaintiffs had exclusive and enforceable trademark rights to the band name \\"Supernova\\" for a number of reasons, including that the Orange County Supernova band had not performed for years, that they were not the only band who used the name \\"Supernova\\", and that their trademark rights had never been very strong. On 12 September 2006, the judge ruled in favor of the original Supernova, granting their request for a preliminary injunction. The injunction kept the producers and musicians of Rock Star from performing, recording, or selling merchandise under the name \\"Supernova\\" pending the outcome of the lawsuit. As a result, the CBS band was simply renamed \\"Rock Star Supernova\\" and the lawsuit was dropped soon thereafter (Rock Star Supernova disbanded in 2008).

They released two studio albums, Abramelin (1995) and Deadspeak (2000), before disbanding in 2002. Abramelin reformed in 2016. In May 2020 the band released their third album Never Enough Snuff.  Acheron  Abramelin were formed in Melbourne in 1988 under the name Acheron as a death metal group by David Abbott on guitars, Derek Ackary on bass guitar, Jason Black on guitars, Michael Colton on drums and Simon Dower on lead vocals. Tim Aldridge replaced Black and the band recorded a demo track, \\"Eternal Suffering\\", before Jason Dutton and Justin Wornes took the places of Colton and Ackary. French label Corpsegrinder Records released a three-track EP, \\"Deprived of Afterlife\\", in 1991, with the line-up of Abbott on lead guitar, Aldridge on lead guitars, Dower on lead vocals, Dutton on drums and Wornes on bass guitar. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, noticed their \\"dark, heavy sound owed much to European and American death metal groups such as Bathory, Entombed, Obituary, Therion, Immolation and General Surgery.\\" They were a part of the early \\"death/grindcore/thrash metal scene\\" in the late 1980s to early 1990s. In September 2008 Dower told Chris Archer of Vomitose that Acheron's sound had progressed by \\"learning how to play our instruments and sing helped a lot. At that time we were all listening to early demos of Carnage, Entombed, Grave, Morbid Angel, etc., all of which had a definite influence on our song writing and overall sound, that and just the natural progression of the band’s direction.\\" A track from their EP later appeared on the Dutch compilation album, Appointment with Fear. Following the release of the EP, Dutton was replaced by Craig Bailey. In 1992 after Abbott left, he was temporarily replaced by Jason Kells (of Australian doom band, diSEMBOWELMENT) who, in turn, was replaced by Mark Schuliga, bass player for the similarly aligned Necrotomy. In November 1993 Acheron supported United Kingdom extreme metallers, Carcass, on the Australian leg of that group's Heartwork Tour: Supreme Blitz to Downunder. They also supported tours by Morbid Angel and Pungent Stench. Bailey left in 1993 and was replaced by Euan Heriot. The group had found that an American black metal band also had the name, Acheron. Hence, inspired by The Book of Abramelin, which concerns a 14th-century alchemist- mage, the group took up their new name.  Renamed  Abramelin's first release under that name was in 1994: a four-track EP, Transgression from Acheron, after which Schuliga departed. Thrust Records, a subsidiary of Australian label, Shock Records, issued their debut studio album of the same name in 1995. McFarlane felt their \\"sound had taken on a sludge-like heaviness only matched by the likes of Brisbane band Misery.\\" Abramelin supported tours by Napalm Death (1995), Paradise Lost and Cathedral (March 1996). The CD was withdrawn from sale in Western Australia due to explicit lyrics dealing with sexual violence against children and necrophilia. Rob Mollica, the drummer with a Melbourne death metal band, Earth, joined Abramelin as a guitarist but Heriot soon departed to uphold commitments with two other bands he was also playing drums for, Blood Duster and Fracture. Ex-Blood Duster drummer Matt Rizzo took Heriot's place on drums, in Abramelin, for a brief stint but after the break-up of Damaged he too was replaced, by Matt \\"Skitz\\" Sanders (Sadistik Exekution). Late in 1997, Abramelin featured at Metal for the Brain, an Australian heavy metal festival. Spanish label, Repulse Records, picked up the debut for wider release but gave it almost no promotional support. Abramelin was re-released in Australia with Transgression from Acheron included, and this time without a lyric sheet in the packaging to avoid it being banned for a second time. After this Abramelin were dormant as a live band for a few years. Their second album Deadspeak was gradually recorded, originally with drums by Sanders although his tracks were later re-recorded using a drum machine. It was released in 2000 on Shock, which featured only Dower on vocals and Aldridge performing all the music. With the live line-up of Aldridge, Dower, Rizzo, Grant Karajic on bass guitar and Matt Wilcock on guitar; Abramelin supported Cradle of Filth and again played at Metal for the Brain. Following this however, the group effectively disbanded. Further recording was rumoured but no new material emerged. Wilcock moved to Steel Affliction and The Berzerker, and then was with UK black/death metal band, Akercocke. Rizzo again became a member of Blood Duster. On 21 October 2013 Abramelin issued a 3× CD, compilation album, Transgressing the Afterlife – The Complete Recordings 1988–2002. Kev Rowland of Metal Music Archives described its \\"total length is nearly four hours long! It is clearly a labour of love, and one thing that really impressed me is the quality of the sound throughout. Normally when faced with complete sets like this, much of it is of interest just for the historical context as opposed to playing this for pleasure (step forward Autopsy for example). But, even the rehearsal tracks sound as if they were recorded with a view for possible release as the sound is good and clear.\\" In 2016, reformed with the line-up of Dower, Aldridge, Wilcock, Mollica and Psycroptic drummer Dave Haley for some live dates. The band's third album, Never Enough Snuff, was released on May 15, 2020.

Dixon also created the theatre company 'The Chameleons Group' in 1994, in which he was the director. They aimed to explore new ways to create multimedia performances and produced four performances whilst Steve Dixon was at the University of Salford. The four performances 'The Chameleon Group' produced were: ‘Chameleons: The Dark Perversity’ in 1994, ‘Chameleons 2: theatre in a movie screen’ in 1999, ‘Chameleons3: Net Congestion’ in 2000 and ‘Chameleons 4: The Doors of Serenity’ in 2002. All of their performances where part of Steve Dixon's practice-as-research. Between the Years 1999 and 2000 Dixon began working on, and became the co-director of the Digital Performance Archive. Whilst at the University of Salford he published several articles which address a range of subjects including performance studies, gender, virtual theatre, pedagogy and cybertheory in leading journals such as The Drama Review (TDR), CTHEORY and Digital Creativity. Dixon also published two CD-ROMs which document and analyse the work of his multimedia theatre company, The Chameleons Group. One in 1996 called 'Chameleons: theatrical experiments in style, genre and multi-media’ and another in 1999 called ‘Chameleons 2: theatre in a movie screen’. In 2004 Steve Dixon's co-authored book with Barry Smith ‘Digital Performance: New Technologies in Theatre, Dance and Performance Art’ was publish by the MIT press.  University of Brunel  In 2005 Steve Dixon left the University of Salford to become the Head of the School of Arts at the University of Brunel.

Published works= The Digital Performance Archive  In 1999 Steve Dixon became a co-director for the newly developed Digital Performance Archive funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Counsel (UK). The Digital Performance Archive was established as a tool to document and analyse interdisciplinary developments in performance which draw upon varied forms of digital media. During the years 1999 – 2000 the Digital Performance Archive recorded all activity found in this field and became an extensive online database of individual works. The unique and intensive research documented over the two years are viewed as a significant historical period for digital performance. The study covers both digital resources used in performance and digital resources on performance in the period studied, examples of these include theatrical performances that incorporate electronic media to performance arts databases. The Digital Performance Archive project holds high value in a wide range of academic disciplines.  Digital Performance: New Technologies in Theatre, Dance and Performance Art  It was after this major research project that Steve Dixon co-authored (with Barry Smith) the book Digital Performance and accompanying DVD Digital Performance: New Technologies in Theatre, Dance and Performance Art which was published by MIT Press in 2004. The 800 pages of Digital Performance outline the theory and history of digital performance. The book analyses topics such as ‘space’ and ‘interactivity’ and pays particular attention to the extensive research project of the Digital Performance Archive between the years of 1999–2000. Subsequently, the book contains additional research from the 1980s, 1990s and work from the early 2000s. Along with providing a history of digital performance, Dixon addresses and critiques views regarding digital performance. Digital Performance has won two international awards – The Association of American Publishers Award for Excellence in Music and the Performing Arts (Professional/Scholarly Publishing Awards) and the Lewis Mumford Award for Outstanding Scholarship in the Ecology of Technics (Media Ecology Association).Grigar, Dene, 2008: ‘Digital Performance: A History of New Media in Theater, Dance, Performance Art, and Installation (review)’, Leonardo 41: 294–295 His contributions to the Digital Performance Archive and the creation of his book Digital Performance have provided a solid grounding for the ongoing discussion of digital performance.Farley, Kathryn, 2007: ‘Digital Performance: A History of New Media in Theatre, Dance, Performance Art, and Installation (review)’, Theatre Journal 59: 690–691.  Published Journals  Steve Dixon published extensively on a broad range of areas including theatre studies, digital arts, film theory, Artificial Intelligence and pedagogy in lead journals such as TDR and CTheory. Dixon is Associate Editor of the International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media, a journal in which he co-founded.  The Chameleons Group  The Chameleons group was a multimedia performance research Company directed by Steve Dixon. The company was founded by Steve Dixon and Paul Murphy, and performer Wendy Reed in 1994. It was established from within the Media and Performance Research Unit (Now the Music, Media, and Performing Arts Research Centre) at the University of Salford. The group consisted of Wendy Reed, Fiona Watson, Paul Murphy, Steve Dixon and Sara Bailes.Dixon, Steve (director), Chameleons : theatrical experiments in style, genre and multi-media, University of Salford, 1996, CD-ROM. The aim of The Chameleons Group was to create multimedia performances. The company devised and toured with live 'film-theatre' productions, where live actors work in front of large video screens, interacting with film characters and their own 'digital doubles', and appear to move from the stage to the screen space. The company has also toured with many original theatre performances that experimented with the integration of video and live performance. In 2000, the group presented their most ambitious interactive cyber-theatre event ever staged, the performance allowed online audiences to direct the actors and write dialogue for the performances in real time. The Chameleons group produced four performances, these were: * Chameleons: The Dark Perversity of Chameleons * Chameleons 2: theatre in a movie screen * Chameleons3: Net Congestion’ * Chameleons 4: The Doors of Serenity As well as four performances Steve Dixon went on to create a two award-winning CD-ROM's which documented and analysed the creation and rehearsal process of the performances of ‘The Dark Perversity of Chameleons’ and ‘Theatre in a Movie Screen’. More recently Chameleons Group performers have collaborated with artist: Paul Sermon, Andrea Zapp and Mathais Fuchs, on the telematic performance Unheimlich. Unheimlich was a telematic performance installation (funded by the Art Council) that was exhibited at conferences including SIGGRAPH which enabled the audience in the US to participate in an improvisation with live performers in the UK. The performance used Freud's notion of the uncanny, Unheimlich (at once familiar, homelike, but also strange, alien and uncomfortable) as its starting point.  Chameleons: The Dark Perversity of Chameleons  The Dark Perversity of Chameleons was the first performance created by The Chameleon Group and directed by Steve Dixon. The idea was conceived and developed by the media and performance research unit at the University of Salford. In the summer of 1994 it was performed at the University of Salford and toured various venues. It was a technically ambitious project that involved the devising of a theatrical text and the shooting and editing of over six hours of original video material. The end video material was screen on five video monitors position in different places on the set. The devising process incorporated a composer (Steven Durrant) who wrote and recorded original music for the production. The aim of the project was to attempt to explore the usefulness of Antonin Artaud theories of performance in specific relation to postmodern theatrical and televisual forms. The production originally attempted to interweave and juxtapose Antonin Artaud's theories of performance with Eastern concepts of ritual and performance codification within and against modern popularist performative models. However, three weeks into the devising process it was evident amongst the performers that it was very difficult to practically realise Antonin Artaud's theories of the actor. So after three weeks of experimenting with Artaudian acting styles, Antonin Artaud's theories were largely abandoned. However, some aspects of Artauds theories remained such as the use of stylised physical gestures, which were employed as a physical language system. The performance was centred on ‘Five people sitting alone in different bedrooms watching television set. The televisions transmit different sequences, depicting each character’s thoughts and memories, mixed with their inner visions – dreams, secrets and hallucinations...’ The performance contained five characters, these characters were: Rachel (Sara Bailes), Derek (Steve Dixon), Mike (Paul Murphy), Veronica (Wendy Reed) and Sophia (Fiona Watson). Each of the characters applied the physical language system to themselves. This meant that each character had four physical gestures which were repeated throughout the piece. As the piece progressed the characters also took on each other's gestures.  Chameleons 2 – Theatre In A Movie Screen  The second research project Steve Dixon and the Chameleons Group created in 1999 was entitled Chameleons 2 – Theatre In A Movie Screen and contained four core performers from the Group, Paul Murphy, Wendy Reed, Julia Eaton and Steve Dixon.Dixon, Steve (director), Chameleons 2: Theatre in a movie screen, University of Salford, 1999, CD ROM The narrative portrayed four characters in an imagined place and time somewhere between reality and a dream, who were striving to find a sense of self and their role within the external world. The primary research objective of the Chameleons Group was to bring a closer integration of the video and of live action. Chameleons 2 evolved over an eight-week devising process in which practical approaches and methodologies such as hot seating were undertaken in the development of the characters and the devising of the show. Three months previously to this process each of the four performers documented their dreams which enabled the company to have an initial springboard for the creation of ideas. The performance space contained a projection screen enclosing hidden doors and windows which live action could take place – the notion of a theatre within a movie screen. The openings in the screen had numerous purposes such as a door that was used an entrance however a window represented a cliff top.  Chameleons 3 – Net Congestion  In 2000 Steve Dixon co-directed and performed two individual cybertheatre performances alongside his performance research company, The Chameleons Group. The performances were entitled ‘Chameleons 3 – Net Congestion’, which contained the core performers of the Chameleons Group, Paul Murphy, Wendy Reed and Steve Dixon himself. Over ten days the performers collaborated with eight guest artists to create edited film footage to be played on screens behind the live performers. The performances took place on three separate stages situated in a black-box studio theatre. The live actors performed on the stages in front of projection screens which played the pre-recorded edited footage; however, there were no live audiences present. Instead the performances were filmed with a three- camera Outside Broadcast unit that relayed the performance over the internet. Audiences online were given the opportunity to log into the live event and contribute to become the performance. The online audiences were invited to type in images, characters and dialogue, providing material for the performers to improvise with. Throughout the piece this opened a gateway for the performers to not only show pre-rehearsed material but also improvise entirely using the online interactive audience as a stimulus. The topic of live and mediatised performance was dominant in this research project undertaken by the Chameleons Group as live Cybertheatre questions this issue. The Chameleons Group aimed to explore the theories of liveness, forming distinctions between the live and mediatised and questioning them through performance. Chameleons 3 – Net Congestion produced a unique interactive cybertheatre performance in which the nature of the relationship held between the performers and audience transformed as the spectators became participants in the online interactive performance.  Chameleons 4 – The Doors of Serenity  In 2002 The Chameleons Group created Chameleons 4 – The Doors of Serenity, directed by Steve Dixon. Dixon also devised and performed the performance alongside Chameleons Group members Anna Fenemore, Wendy Reed and Barry Woods. Four characters, a devil male escort, a genital-less femme fatale, a paranoid cyborg and a vampire bimbo played dangerous games through doors. Similarly to Chameleons 2, the performance incorporates multiple imaging and split screen digital video techniques with live theatre performed in hidden doors and windows within the screen itself. The Chameleons Group used this digital performance to explore the relationship between the esoteric and the populist; the disturbing and the comedic and the virtual and the 'real'. The multimedia theatre used aided the fusion of vivid dream narratives, surrealist comedy and the Artaudian techniques of the theatre of cruelty.

He previously worked for West End Games and TSR, Inc., and designed products for Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars, Alternity, Torg, Paranoia and Ghostbusters. Biography=Early life Bill Slavicsek was born and raised in New York City. Slavicsek was a comic book, horror, and science fiction fan as a boy: \\"Some of my earliest memories involve looking at issues of Marvel Comics, drawing my own comics, and watching old SF and horror movies on TV\\". Interested in gaming from an early age, Slavicsek was introduced to roleplaying games in 1977 when he discovered Dungeons & Dragons. Originally intending to pursue a career as a comic book artist, Slavicsek switched to journalism and communication at St. John's University. West End Games After working for a year at a community newspaper, Slavicsek was hired by West End Games as an editor in 1986. In 1987 the company secured the license to publish a Star Wars roleplaying game, a project which Slavicsek oversaw as an editor and developer. Slavicsek oversaw the Star Wars line for its first year. In 1988 he was promoted to Creative and Editorial Director for WEG. He co-created the Torg game with Greg Gorden, published in 1990, and co-authored the novel Stormknights, which was set in the Torg universe. Slavicsek left West End later in 1990. TSR In 1991, Slavicsek began working as a freelancer, and was hired as a designer/editor by TSR in 1993. At TSR, he designed the Alternity game with Rich Baker, as well as the Revised Dark Sun Campaign Setting, and The Nightmare Lands for the Ravenloft setting. For much of the 1990s he was working simultaneously for both WEG and TSR as an editor and designer on various projects. He wrote A Guide to the Star Wars Universe, a definitive reference to Star Wars movies, books, and games, which was published by Del Rey in 1994. Slavicsek is considered one of the world's leading experts on Star Wars, and has written the second and third editions of A Guide to the Star Wars Universe. Wizards of the Coast By the end of 1997, Slavicsek was the Director of the TSR Product Group for Wizards of the Coast; that job was later divided in two, making him the Director of Roleplaying Game design. Peter Adkison selected Slavicsek to be the head of RPG research and development. Richard Baker and Slavicsek designed the Alternity sci-fi RPG for TSR to replace their Amazing Engine game, and Wizards published the game in 1997. Peter Adkison left the third edition Dungeons & Dragons design work to Slavicsek and a group of ex-TSR employees. In December 2000, Hasbro told Wizards to cut 10% of their staff; Slavicsek was the \\"Director of Category\\" overseeing a team of about 60 people, and opted to close down the L.A. office of Last Unicorn Games. By the time of the publication of the d20 edition of the Star Wars Roleplaying Game in 2000, Slavicsek held the title of Vice President and Director of RPG R&D; for Wizards of the Coast. The Eberron Campaign Setting (2004) was produced by Keith Baker alongside James Wyatt and Slavicsek. As the Director of R&D; for Dungeons & Dragons, Slavicsek began thinking about a fourth edition of D&D; as early as 2005, when he organized a team to work on some early designs, headed by Rob Heinsoo and also containing Andy Collins and James Wyatt. Slavicsek and Mike Mearls designed the Castle Ravenloft Board Game (2010). Slavicsek announced his departure from Wizards of the Coast on June 23, 2011. After Wizards of the Coast Slavicsek became a writer and content designer at ZeniMax Online Studios, which developed and released The Elder Scrolls Online MMORPG.

Lee, that stars Louis Hayward, Joan Bennett, and George Sanders. The Small production uses the same sets and many of the same cast and production crew as his previous year's production of The Man in the Iron Mask. Richards 1977, p. 64. Hayward returned to star in Small's The Return of Monte Cristo (1946). The film takes the same name as the unofficial sequel to The Count of Monte Cristo, namely The Son of Monte Cristo, written by Jules Lermina in 1881. Using elements from several romantic swashbucklers of the time such as The Prisoner of Zenda and The Mark of Zorro the production also mirrors the situation of Continental Europe in 1939–1940. Plot In 1865, the proletarian General Gurko Lanen (George Sanders) becomes the behind-the- scenes dictator of the Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg located in the Balkans. Gurko suppresses the clergy and the free press and imprisons the Prime Minister Baron Von Neuhoff (Montagu Love). The rightful ruler of the Grand Duchy, the Grand Duchess Zona (Joan Bennett), hopes to get aid from Napoleon III of France and makes her escape pursued by a troop of Hussars loyal to Gurko. While on a hunting trip, the visiting Count of Monte Cristo (Louis Hayward), rescues her. The Count escorts the Grand Duchess Zona to a neutral country, but Gurko's Hussars violate international neutrality to return the Grand Duchess and her lady-in-waiting back to Lichtenburg. The count has become romantically enamored of Zona and undertakes to help her, visiting the Grand Duchy where he falls in with the underground resistance movement of Lichtenburg. He befriends the loyal Lt. Dorner (Clayton Moore) of the palace guard who knows a variety of secret passages leading from the Grand Ducal Palace to the literal catacombs of the Grand Duchy. Discovering that Baron Von Neuhoff is to be executed, the Count gains entry to the palace through his previously being asked for a large loan of French Francs by Gurko and plays the role of a cowardly fopish international banker. There he overhears Gurko meeting with the French Ambassador (Georges Renavent) who raises the issue of human rights in the Grand Duchy. Gurko counters him by saying he is signing a non aggression pact with Russia protecting Lichtenburg from any French threats. Gurko schemes to gain the nation's loyalty by marrying the Grand Duchess and keeping the pact with Russia a secret. The count becomes a masked freedom fighter named \\"The Torch\\" after the underground newspaper in order to save the Grand Duchy. He then sets out to right the wrongs and capture the heart of the woman he loves. Cast * Louis Hayward as Edmond Dantès, Jr. * Joan Bennett as Grand Duchess Zona * George Sanders as Gen.

The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu (1930) was a sequel to The Mysterious Dr Fu Manchu then Lee made Ladies Love Brutes (1930) and Derelict (1930) with Bancroft, and A Man from Wyoming (1930) with Cooper. =England= Lee went to Warners to make The Ruling Voice (1931) with Walter Huston. He based himself in England for the next two years where he wrote an English version script of Captain Craddock (1931), did The Guilty Generation (1931) at Columbia and That Night in London (1931) for Paramount in England; the latter starred Robert Donat. Back at Fox, Lee directed Zoo in Budapest (1933), I Am Suzanne (1933) and Gambling (1934); the latter starred George M. Cohan. =Edward Small= Edward Small hired Lee to write and direct an adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo (1934) for United Artists starring Donat; it was a huge success and ushered in a cycle of swashbuckling films. Fox had merged to become 20th Century-Fox whose production head Darryl F. Zanuck hired Lee to direct one of the studio's first films, the biopic Cardinal Richelieu (1935) starring George Arliss. Lee received an offer from RKO to write and direct another swashbuckler, The Three Musketeers (1935). For United Artists he did One Rainy Afternoon (1936) and the English-shot Agatha Christie adaptation, Love from a Stranger (1937). Back in Hollywood, Lee was reunited with Small for The Toast of New York (1937), a biopic that was a notorious flop. It was made at RKO who also financed Lee's next film, Mother Carey's Chickens (1938). =Universal= Lee signed a contract at Universal, where he directed Service de Luxe (1938). He had a big success with Son of Frankenstein (1939) starring Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff. Lee followed it with The Sun Never Sets (1939) with Rathbone and Douglas Fairbanks Jr, and Tower of London (1939) with Rathbone and Karloff. Later films Lee made another swashbuckler for Small, The Son of Monte Cristo (1940). He returned to RKO to do Powder Town (1942), then made a film for another independent producer, Benedict Bogeaus, The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1944). Bogeaus liked Lee's work and used him on the swashbuckler Captain Kidd (1945). Lee announced he would then made a film about Robespierre but he ended up retiring in 1945. The Rowland V. Lee Ranch and later life Lee focused on running his ranch in the San Fernando Valley which he had bought in 1935. He raised cattle and alfalfa. In August 1940, two girls drowned in his private lake while Lee was away. He converted part of his acreage overlooking the Chatsworth Reservoir into a motion picture location. Among the films shot there were I've Always Loved You, Strangers on a Train (1951), At Sword's Point, The Night of the Hunter (1956), Friendly Persuasion (1956),The Light in the Forest (1958) and Back Street (1961). By the early 1960s though the land had become too valuable to use as a location. Lee decided to return to filmmaking by producing The Big Fisherman from the novel by Lloyd C. Douglas. He wrote the script with Howard Estabrook and hired Frank Borzage to direct it. In 1975, three months past his 84th birthday, Lee died of a heart attack at home in Palm Desert, California, having just finished writing a screenplay, a mystery called The Belt. He was survived by his wife, Eleanor, and brother, Donald W. Lee, a former Hollywood film writer. While it has been reported incorrectly that the former Rowland V. Lee Ranch was subdivided and developed after his death, in fact development of the property began much earlier. Portions of the ranch had begun to be developed by the late 1950s, with the Corporate Pointe industrial park among the first major projects to be built in the area. Development continued throughout the 1960s, with much of the ranch becoming suburban single-family housing typical of the western San Fernando Valley. The section of the former ranch containing Lee Lake was the last major portion to be developed, becoming the gated community Hidden Lake Estates, which was completed by 1971. The lake remains intact as a part of the gated community. Lee has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.Resting Places Complete filmography=As actor *Wild Winship's Widow (1917) - Archibald Herndon *Time Locks and Diamonds (1917) - Edgar Seymour * The Mother Instinct (1917) - Jacques *Polly Ann (1917) - Howard Straightlane *The Stainless Barrier (1917) - Richard Shelton *The Maternal Spark (1917) - Howard Helms *They're Off (1918) - Randolph Manners *The Woman in the Suitcase (1920) - W.H.

Constructed secretly during the Second World War in response to the Japanese threat, they were intended to house operational headquarters in the event of attack. The military commandeered the Cracroft Wilson estate, founded by Sir John Cracroft Wilson in 1854, for their Southern Group headquarters, and work on the tunnels began in 1942.\\"Into the abyss\\", 02/11/2009, The Press Partially lined cavern (notice the rocks above the concrete ceiling) and ring laser equipment Railways were built for access and for the removal of waste soil. The largest cavern was 7 metres high, 10 metres wide and 30 metres long. Prestressed concrete was used to line the caverns. Officers based in the estate house would come down stairs into the tunnels, while others were to enter through the access tunnels. Construction came to a sudden halt in 1944 as the threat of invasion receded, even though work on the bunkers was nearly complete. The weekend before the military left the estate, fire broke out and the Cracroft Wilson House was burnt to the ground. The entrances to the underground complex were sealed after the war, and the existence of the caverns was largely forgotten until 1987 when TVNZ reporter Jeff Field was told of the caverns during a chance conversation with a gardener at Cashmere Hospital. Using the archives at the Ministry of Defence, Field discovered references to the caverns in newspaper articles dating from January 1945. The investigation was assigned to another reporter, Bill Cockram, who contacted the owner of Cashmere House which has been rebuilt following the fire. With the permission of the owner, excavations were carried out and the caverns were entered for the first time since the end of the Second World War. The caverns now became the home of a series of ring laser experiments set up by the University of Canterbury's physics department, taking advantage of the extremely stable temperature in the caves.\\"Cracroft Caverns Laboratory \\" Plaque above the main entrance There is now an associated small public park behind the Princess Margaret Hospital.

Established under its current name in 1995, its primary concert venue is the Örebro Concert Hall. The historical precursor ensembles to the orchestra included the Harmonic Society (Harmoniska sällskapet), which was active from 1831 to 1837. In 1859, the Philharmoniska sällskapet (Philharmonic Society) was founded under Karl Johan Lewerth. A competitor organisation, the Örebro musikförening Philomele (Örebro Music Association Philomele), was founded in 1868, and continued operations until 1916. In 1909, the Örebro orkesterförening (Örebro Orchestra Association), as an amateur orchestra. The ensemble began to receive support from the Örebro municipality in 1912. The composer Ingvar Lidholm took up a leadership post with the ensemble in 1947. In 1950, four full-time band musicians joined the orchestra. In 1955, the organisation was transformed into a municipal foundation under the name of the Örebro orkesterstiftelse (Örebro Orchestra Foundation). Additional musicians, both professionals and military musicians, were recruited to the ensemble. In 1962, the Örebro kammarorkester (Örebro Chamber Orchestra) was formally established. In 1977, a new reorganisation occurred to form the Örebro symfoniorkester (Örebro Symphony Orchestra), as a professional ensemble. In parallel, the Örebro orkesterförening resumed operations as an amateur orchestra. In May 1995, the most recent reorganisation combined the Örebro Symphony Orchestra and the Örebro Chamber Orchestra into a single ensemble, the Swedish Chamber Orchestra. Thomas Dausgaard became the first principal conductor of the new ensemble in 1997. Nikolaj Znaider was principal guest conductor of the orchestra for three years, from 2009 to 2012. Dausgaard is scheduled to conclude his principal conductorship of the orchestra after the 2018-2019 season, and subsequently to take the title of conductor laureate with the orchestra. In May 2017, the orchestra announced the appointment of Martin Fröst as its next principal conductor, effective with the 2019-2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons. Karin Rehnqvist was composer- in-residence with the orchestra from 2000 to 2004. The orchestra has recorded commercially for such labels as BIS Records, Simax, Naxos Records and Hyperion Records.

Description  Unlike ostension, which is the act of showing or pointing to a sample, exemplification is possession of a property plus reference to its label (Goodman, 1976). For example, if a color sample has the property labelled 'green', then the color sample exemplifies green. At its most basic, possession of a property amounts to being correctly referred to by its label. In other words, an entity, 'x' can be said to possess a certain property if and only if: (1) there can be an abstract singular term which denotes that property, and (2) those assertions are true which predicate such an abstract term of a name or phrase denoting x.  A mode of reference  Reference is the relation between something \\"standing for\\" something else, like the relation between a word and what it denotes. Usually reference goes in one direction, from the word to what it denotes, but it may also go in both directions, from the denoted back to the word. For instance, when a patch of green paint is used as a colour sample. The sample refers to green by possessing it and thus being referred to by the word denoting it. The sample exemplifies green, it stands for it, and in this way exemplification is a mode of reference.  Uses of exemplification  *Product samples exemplify certain properties they possess. *As a part in ostensive definition, i.e. definition by exemplification of what is defined. For example, an artist can define a new style by showing works that exemplify it. *Defined exemplification is a pattern of essay development that uses specific instances (examples) to clarify a point, to add interest, or to persuade (Clouse, 2006). *Exemplification means using examples to explain, convince, or amuse. Lending interest and information to writing, exemplification is one of the most common and effective ways to developing ideas. Examples may be developed in a sentence or more, or they may be only phrases or even single words, as in the following sentence: \\"Children like packaged breakfast foods, such as Wheaties, Cheerios, and Rice Krispies.\\"  See also  *Reference *Ostensive definition *Nominalism References *Goodman, Nelson, 1976, Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols.

History When local newspaper Moonlight ceased publication on December 9, 1978, Haveeru was registered on December 28, 1978, to fill the gap created by the absence of a newspaper. The first issue of Haveeru was brought out on January 1, 1979, under the proprietorship of Mohamed Zahir Hussain, who is a close friend of the President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and has been serving Minister level positions of the government since 1978 The name The name Haveeru symbolises the onset of the cool evening time after the heat of the day, which is also the time when the newspaper is brought out. In Dhivehi literature, \\"haveeru kurun\\" means the get-together of poets and writers for literary exchanges. Thus, it was decided that the newspaper's name should also symbolise news, information and literary learning. Haveeru Daily is the longest serving daily newspaper in Maldives, which marked its 20th anniversary on 1 January 1999. Haveeru is the first newspaper to be printed by offset. The newspaper's efforts at getting its own printing press dates as far back as 1 April 1981, when a private printer declined to publish the newspaper. With just a break of one day, seen by many as an April Fools' Day joke, Haveeru rolled off from another press, but this time not in offset, but hand-written on stencils for cyclostyling. The page size was 30x42 cm. The newspaper first rolled off Haveeru's own offset press on 1 September 1986, with a new enlarged size of 38x55cm. The size was later increased to 42.5x60.5 cm on 1 January 1994. Many technical setbacks have been overcome with innovation and automation. Haveeru is the first Maldives newspaper to be computerised, in 1985. In also another first, Haveeru began to use Thaana typewriters and Thaana word processors. The United Nations Environment programme bestowed its Global 500 environmental honour on Haveeru's photojournalist Mohamed Zahir following a series of environmental articles published in Haveeru, which he wrote under the initials \\"Meemu Zaviyani\\". Haveeru is the first newspaper in Maldives to link up with a foreign news agency, the first such link-up being in Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) in 1985. However, the use of radioteletype receivers was not then a successful venture as news reception was often disrupted by unstable weather. Hence, Haveeru turned towards satellite communications, and the newspaper became the first Maldives daily to establish links—via satellite—to get news and information for the print media. Haveeru also linked up with Agence France-Presse (AFP) in 1992. It was followed by another link-up with Reuters news agency in 1994. In May 1998, Haveeru established Haveeru Addu Bureau at Addu atoll Feydhoo Island, the first regional news centre by a Maldives newspaper. Two full-time journalists are stationed there to cover events in the southern atolls, and reporting is carried out by sending information via the World Wide Web. Civil Court on Saturday (2 April 2016) also that Haveeru shut down its online news website as well as all other branches of the company – which's ownership is being disputed over. Civil Court sent a letter to Chairman of Haveeru, Dr. Mohamed Zahir Hussein, saying that Haveeru needs to comply with the order issued by the court to temporarily halt all of the company's operations which includes using the logo of the company or publishing anything under the name of Haveeru unless in accordance with the procedure stated in the court order; so that the trial remains fair and just. High Court ruled last September that Haveeru News Agency wasn't just the company's chairman Dr. Mohamed Zahir Hussain's. And that Farooq Hassan from G. Kokkiri and Ibrahim Rasheed Moosa from H. Meerubahuru also had a stake in the company. Court had ordered Haveeru to pay Farooq and Ibrahim Rasheed one fourth of the profit made by the company to date, each. Civil Court issued the order for a temporary halt to Haveeru operations on Thursday in response to a lawsuit filed by Farooq and Ibrahim Rasheed. Court ordered a halt to all bank transactions from any of the company's accounts, and to halt any operation by the company without the involvement of Farooq and Ibrahim Rasheed until the ownership issue was resolved in court. Haveeru News Agency said that Haveeru Online News would remain operational as the order did not affect it. Civil Court said that they issued the order based on the damage to Farooq and Ibrahim Rasheed – who hold a combined share of 50 percent, while Zahir from H. Neel Villa holds only 25 percent. Adding that Farooq and Ibrahim Rasheed had the right to request for a temporary halt to Haveeru operations. High Court had ruled earlier that an agreement had been made between four individuals to set up Haveeru News Agency. And that all four founding members had a stake in the company even now. The fourth shareholder is Mohamed Naeem from H. Timeless. The court had said that Farooq and Ibrahim Rasheed still had a stake in the company despite Haveeru News Agency and all subsidiary companies having been renamed. Haveeru Online News is a media publication run by Haveeru Media Group – a company registered under the name of Zahir's three children – Lubna Zahir Husseinhttps://twitter.com/LubnaZahir/status/1267192550751903745, Leena Zahir Hussein and Vail Zahir Hussein. Haveeru Online was mostly shut down due to the political influence of President Abdulla Yamin. Legal Disputes Main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) on Monday voiced grave concern over the blatant violation of rights in the court verdict banning the staff of the archipelago's oldest newspaper from working for any other media outlet. Civil Court on Sunday concluded a legal dispute over the ownership of the country's oldest newspaper Haveeru and associated media, barring all employees of Haveeru Media Group from working at any media outlet in the country for two years. MDP in a statement described the verdict in clear violation of the constitution as a “mockery” of justice. The judge had also ruled based on assumptions that were not entailed in the employment contracts, MDP said. Article 37(a) of the constitution states that every citizen has the right to engage in any employment or occupation. The constitution also prohibits slavery and forced labour. The statement also accused the courts of issuing verdicts in stark contradiction of the laws governing the country which undermines and violates the rights of journalists and the people. “President Yameen’s government has continued to be an obstacle to reforming and ensuring the freedom of the judiciary,” the statement in local language Dhivehi read. The judge invoked a maxim in Islamic jurisprudence on preventing damage to justify the ban. He also ordered the home ministry, the broadcasting commission, and other state institutions to take action against former staff working at other media organisations within seven days upon request by the majority shareholders. The verdict has also sparked public outcry and condemnation and has been described as a violation of the constitution which provided further proof of the continued government crackdown on media freedom in the archipelago. Haveeru shut down its operations in March following a Civil Court order to involve the plaintiffs in its management, including in the making of editorial decisions and financial transactions. “The latest verdict by the Civil Court is in direct violation of fundamental human rights enshrined in the constitution. Barring anyone from working at a place of their choosing infringes on their right to work. The Civil Court, in issuing its verdict, has once again overlooked the rights as well as the plight of more than 50 employees and their families,” Mihaaru said in a statement shortly after the verdict. “The Civil Court’s verdict effectively shuts down the operations of Mihaaru, the only newspaper in circulation. This is an act of aggression by the state towards independent and free media in the Maldives, and is part of the government’s unprecedented crackdown on media freedom which has seen the shutdown of four newspapers and online news services over the course of six months.” The judge invoked a maxim in Islamic jurisprudence on preventing damage to justify the ban. Haveeru was shut down in March after its three new shareholders sued the paper's founder, Dr Mohamed Zahir Hussain, for a share of assets and profits for the past 35 years. The lawsuit followed a controversial High Court ruling last year that split the paper's ownership four ways. The appellate court awarded three former editorial staff a controlling stake based on a copy of a 1983 agreement. After the lawsuit was filed in February, Haleem ordered the paper on April 2 to involve Farooq Hassan, Ibrahim Rasheed Moosa, and Mohamed Naeem in its management, including a role in making of editorial decisions and financial transactions. However, in lieu of involving the new shareholders, the Haveeru Media Group – owned by Zahir's three children – closed the paper and took its website offline. In 3 July 2016's judgment, the judge ordered the Haveeru Media Group and relevant state authorities to transfer the newspaper, its online version, archive, its printing press, and other business interests related to the brand to the majority shareholders. He also ordered the registrar of companies to change the name of the Haveeru Media Group within seven days. Zahir was ordered to revive and continue the Haveeru newspaper, website, and printing press in accordance with the wishes of the majority shareholders. The judge also ordered Zahir to audit Haveeru and to offer the other three owners their share. Attorney General (Attorney General and Acting home minister Mohamed Anil) on 7 July 2016 labelled the two year media ban imposed on former staff the now defunct Haveeru newspaper as unconstitutional before announcing the decision to appeal the verdict. Civil Court concluded a legal dispute over the ownership of the country's oldest newspaper Haveeru and associated media, barring all employees of Haveeru Media Group from working at any media outlet in the country for two years. The verdict has been widely regarded as an attempt to close the Mihaaru newspaper launched by the staff following the forced closure of Haveeru. The two-year ban on Mihaaru journalists was imposed in the final verdict of the ownership lawsuit who worked for Haveeru from February this year. The judge invoked a maxim in Islamic jurisprudence on preventing damage to justify the ban. He also ordered the home ministry, the broadcasting commission, and other state institutions to take action against former staff working at other media organisations within seven days upon request by the majority shareholders. The AG office in a press release said the appeal would be primarily based on the order to the authorities to enforce the ban which was clearly in violation of the constitution. “The home ministry nor any other state institution has the legal authority to prevent any individual from being employed anywhere of his or her choosing,” the statement in local language Dhivehi read. The statement also noted that the court had clearly denied the ex-Haveeru staff as a third party in the case to have a say which was in violation of the constitution and “Audi alteram partem.” The decision for the state initiated appeal came after the civil court reprimanded the Attorney General for saying that the home ministry, by law would not be able to take any action against the Haveeru staff despite the court order. “As far as I can see this a civil case. So the defendant has the right for appeal. But as the home ministry is now involved, all I can tell you is that in light of the constitution and the laws, we [home ministry] cannot take any action against the staff even if they work for any other media organisation,” Attorney General Mohamed Anil had said earlier. However, in a fresh ruling on Monday, the civil court countered the Attorney General's statement ruling that it was null and void. “All state institutions are obligated to comply and immediately enforce a court ruling until it is overruled by a higher court,” the ruling read. Meanwhile, Over 30 staff formerly employed by Haveeru had filed an appeal of the verdict at the High Court citing that the verdict clearly violated constitutional rights. The case had also voiced concern over the civil court's blatant disregard to the employee contracts made with Haveeru which had no clause barring its staff from working for other media outlets.

He was a popular author in antebellum America. A friend of Edgar Allan Poe, Lippard advocated a socialist political philosophy and sought justice for the working class in his writings. He founded a secret benevolent society, Brotherhood of the Union, investing in it all the trappings of a religion; the society, a precursor to labor organizations, survived until 1994. He authored two principal kinds of stories: Gothic tales about the immorality, horror, vice, and debauchery of large cities, such as The Monks of Monk Hall (1844), reprinted as The Quaker City (1844); and historical fiction of a type called romances, such as Blanche of Brandywine (1846), Legends of Mexico (1847), and the popular Legends of the Revolution (1847). Both kinds of stories, sensational and immensely popular when written, are mostly forgotten today. Lippard died at the age of 31 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 9, 1854. Life and work=Early life George Lippard was born on April 10, 1822, near Yellow Springs, in West Nantmeal Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, on the farm of his father, Daniel B. Lippard. The family moved to the city of Philadelphia two years later, shortly after his father was injured in a farming accident. Young Lippard grew up in Philadelphia, in Germantown (presently part of the city of Philadelphia), and Rhinebeck, New York (where he attended the Classical Academy). After considering a career in the Methodist religious ministry and rejecting it because of a \\"contradiction between theory and practice\\" of Christianity, he began the study of law, which he also abandoned, as it was incompatible with his beliefs about human justice. Following the death of his father in 1837, Lippard spent some time living like a homeless bohemian, working odd jobs and living in abandoned buildings and studios. Life on Philadelphia's streets gave him firsthand knowledge of the effects the Panic of 1837 had on the urban poor. Distressed by the misery he witnessed, \\"Lippard decided to become a writer for the masses.\\"Reynolds, David. Introduction to The Quaker City; or The Monks of Monk Hall Amherst, MA: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1970: xi. George Lippard Early writing career Lippard then commenced employment with the Philadelphia daily newspaper Spirit of the Times. His lively sketches and police court reporting drew readers and increased the paper's circulation. He was but twenty when The Saturday Evening Post published his first story, a \\"legend\\" called \\"Philippe de Agramont.\\" Lippard wrote what he called \\"historical fictions and legends\\", which he defined as \\"history in its details and delicate tints, with the bloom and dew yet fresh upon it, yet told to us, in the language of passion, of poetry, of home!\\"Pfitzer, Gregory M. Popular History and the Literary Marketplace, 1840–1920. University of Massachusetts Press, 2008: 43. These works, then, were not so much about what happened, as what Lippard believed ought to have happened. Some of his legendary romances include: The Ladye Annabel (1842); 'Bel of Prairie Eden (1848); Blanche of Brandywine (1846); The Nazarene (1846); Legends of Mexico (1847); and Legends of the Revolution (1847). One of the particular Legends of the Revolution was called \\"The Fourth of July, 1776,\\" though it has come down to us under the name \\"Ring, Grandfather, Ring\\". The story was first published on January 2, 1847, in the Philadelphia Saturday Courier before being collected in Washington and His Generals. The story introduced \\"a tall slender man... dressed in a dark robe\\", left unidentified, whose stirring speech inspired the faint-hearted members of the Second Continental Congress to sign the Declaration of Independence.Nash, Gary B. The Liberty Bell. Yale University Press, 2010: 42–43. . After the document was signed, Lippard claimed, independence was announced to the people by the ringing of the Liberty Bell on the 4th of July,Pfitzer, Gregory M. Popular History and the Literary Marketplace, 1840–1920. University of Massachusetts Press, 2008: 46. causing its fabled crack, though this event did not happen. Another of Lippard's legends misrepresents somewhat the beliefs of Johannes Kelpius and his community of followers along the Wissahickon Creek; John Greenleaf Whittier relied on Lippard's legend about Kelpius for his long poem Pennsylvania Pilgrim. Another of Lippard's legends, \\"The Dark Eagle,\\" about Benedict Arnold, was received uncritically by later readers, though few of its contemporary readers would have done the same. Many of the legends were republished in the Saturday Courier; another edition Legends of the Revolution was published 22 years after his death in 1876. The Quaker City George Lippard's most notorious story, The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall (1845) is a lurid and thickly plotted exposé of city life in antebellum Philadelphia. Highly anti-capitalistic in its message, Lippard aimed to expose the hypocrisy of the Philadelphia elite, as well as the darker underside of American capitalism and urbanization. Lippard's Philadelphia is populated with parsimonious bankers, foppish drunkards, adulterers, sadistic murderers, reverend rakes, and confidence men, all of whom the author depicts as potential threats to the Republic. Considered the first muckraking novel,Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 205. it was the best-selling novel in America before Uncle Tom's Cabin.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 211. When it appeared in print in 1845, it sold 60,000 copies in its first year and at least 10,000 copies throughout the next decade.Reynolds, David. Introduction to The Quaker City; or The Monks of Monk Hall,\\" Amerhest, MA, The University of Massachusetts Press, 1970: vii. Its success made Lippard one of the highest-paid American writers of the 1840s, earning $3,000 to $4,000 a year.Streeby, Shelley. American Sensations: Class, Empire, and the Production of Popular Culture. University of California Press, 2002: 40. The Quaker City is partly based on the March 1843 New Jersey trial of Singleton Mercer.Cleman, John. \\"Irresistible Impulses: Edgar Allan Poe and the Insanity Defense\\", collected in Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe, edited by Harold Bloom. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2001: 67 Mercer was accused of the murder of Mahlon Hutchinson Heberton aboard the Philadelphia-Camden ferry vessel John Finch on February 10, 1843. Heberton had seduced (or raped - sources differ upon this point), Mercer's sixteen-year-old sister. Mercer entered a plea of insanity and was found not guilty. The trial took place only two months after Edgar Allan Poe's short story \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" a story based on other murder trials employing the insanity defense; Mercer's defense attorney openly acknowledged the \\"object of ridicule\\" which an insanity defense had become. Nonetheless, a verdict of not-guilty was rendered after less than an hour of jury deliberation, and the family and the lawyer of young Mercer were greeted by a cheering crowd while disembarking from the same Philadelphia-Camden ferry line on which the killing took place. Lippard employed the seduction aspect of the trial as a metaphor for the oppression of the helpless. The Monks of Monk Hall outraged some readers with its lingering descriptions of \\"heaving bosoms\\" but such descriptions also drew readers and he sold many books. A stage version was prepared but banned in Philadelphia for fear of riots. Though many were offended by the story's lurid elements, the book also prompted social and legal reform and may have led to New York's 1849 enactment of an anti-seduction law. Lippard took advantage of the popularity of his novel The Quaker City to establish his own weekly periodical, also named The Quaker City. He advertised it as \\"A Popular Journal, devoted to such matters of Literature and news as will interest the great mass of readers\\".Streeby, Shelley. American Sensations: Class, Empire, and the Production of Popular Culture. University of California Press, 2002: 41. Its first issue was published December 30, 1848.Streeby, Shelley. American Sensations: Class, Empire, and the Production of Popular Culture. University of California Press, 2002: 44. Social reformer In 1850 Lippard founded the Brotherhood of the Union (later the Brotherhood of America), a secret benevolent society aiming to eliminate poverty and crime by removing the social ills causing them. His own title in the organization was \\"Supreme Washington\\".Bryan, William Alfred. George Washington in American Literature 1775–1865. New York: Columbia University Press, 1952: 214. His legend-like vision was that such an organization would establish a means for men to sincerely follow a living religion. The organization grew and achieved a membership of 30,000 by 1917, but declined some time thereafter, ceasing to exist in 1994. He was a popular lecturer, journalist, and dramatist, renowned for both the stories he wrote and for his relentless advocacy of social justice. He was a participant in the National Reform Congress (1848) and the Eighth National Industrial Congress (1853), and in 1850 founded the Brotherhood of the Union. He was not, however, immune from some of the particular prejudices of his day. The Monks of Monk Hall (also published as Quaker City) portrays a malevolent hump-backed Jewish character, Gabriel Van Gelt, one who forges, swindles, blackmails, and commits murder for money. Lippard's portrayal of blacks also reflects some of the stereotypes of his day; this is certainly hinted at in the lengthy full title of one of his sensational crime novels: The killers: A narrative of real life in Philadelphia: in which the deeds of the killers, and the great riot of election night, October 10, 1849, are minutely described : Also, the adventures of three notorious individuals, who took part in that riot, to wit: Cromwell D. Z. Hicks, the leader of the Killers; Don Jorge, one of the leaders of the Cuban expedition; and \\"The Bulgine,\\" the celebrated Negro Desperado of Moyamensing. A bulgine is a derisive term for a nautical steam engine or a small dockside locomotive; the term is recalled in several folk songs, including the capstan shanty \\"Eliza Lee\\", also known as \\"Clear the Track, Let the Bulgine Run\\". Unlike many labor reformers of his time, Lippard was an enthusiastic supporter of the Mexican–American War. In an 1848 speech, he argued that Western expansion could provide working-class Americans with an opportunity to establish themselves as landholders, and thus to escape the oppressive conditions of urban factories. His novels Legends of Mexico: The Battles of Taylor (1847) and 'Bel of Prairie Eden (1848) used Gothic conventions to represent the war as a heroic fulfillment of the American Revolution's egalitarian promise. Later in his career, Lippard seemed to grow more ambivalent about the war, and in 1851 he published a sketch called \\"A Sequel to the Legends of Mexico\\" in which he expressed a concern that the way he depicted the conflict in his novels might \\"lead young hearts into an appetite for blood-shedding\\". Literary life Many of his stories dealt with the early leaders of the United States, including George Washington and Benedict Arnold. Lippard particularly admired Washington and devoted more pages to him than any other writer of fiction up to that time, though his stories are often sensationalized and immersed in Gothic elements. In one of his later stories Lippard relates that George Washington rises from his tomb at Mount Vernon to take pilgrimage of nineteenth-century America accompanied by an immortal Roman named Adonai. The pair travel to Valley Forge where they see a strange, huge building and hear chaotic, frightening noises. The building turns out to be a factory. George Lippard married Rose Newman on May 15, 1847. In an unconventional ceremony they were married outdoors in the evening of a new moon while standing on Mom Rinker's Rock above the Wissahickon Creek. That year, Lippard moved to 965 North Sixth Street, a home in which Poe had used as his final home in Philadelphia before moving to New York. His friendship with Edgar Allan Poe is notable. Poe gave Lippard credit for rescuing him from the streets on several occasions. He was more reserved about Lippard's artistic merits; possibly Poe's own artistic standards were too high to admit praise of Lippard's writing. This is ironic, because everything we generally associate with Poe was even more intense in Lippard's style. Lippard wrote an effusive obituary after Poe's death. Final years George Lippard's wife died on May 21, 1851 shortly after the March death of their infant son. Their daughter had died in 1850 at the age of 18 months.Emilio De Grazia. The Life and Works of George Lippard. Ph.D. Dissertation, The Ohio State University, 1969: 377-8. In 1852, Lippard spoke in Philadelphia on the 115th birthday of Thomas Paine, attempting to redeem his political legacy and reputation, which had faltered somewhat due to his book The Age of Reason. In his version of Paine's life, Paine was responsible for convincing John Adams, Benjamin Rush, and Benjamin Franklin to seek American independence.Kaye, Harvey J. Thomas Paine and the Promise of America. New York: Hill and Wang, 2005: 146–147. . He was also caught in a controversy with Philadelphia publisher, who incorrectly claimed that Lippard had agreed to publish exclusively with him. Other distributors suffered as a result and Lippard referred to Peterson as a \\"mercenary creature\\" who had \\"made his thousands of dollars off of me\\".Pfitzer, Gregory M. Popular History and the Literary Marketplace, 1840–1920. University of Massachusetts Press, 2008: 45. Death Always frail, Lippard suffered from tuberculosis for the last years of his life. Confined to his house with the disease, Lippard spent the final months of his life writing a newspaper story protesting against the Fugitive Slave Law.Reynolds, David. Introduction to The Quaker City; or Monks of Monk Hall, Amherst, MA: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1970: xix He died on February 9, 1854, at his home, then 1509 Lawrence Street, shortly before attaining the age of 32. His last words were to his physician: \\"Is this death?\\"Latham, Edwardd. Famous Sayings And Their Authors: A Collection of Historical Sayings in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, and Latin. London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co., 1906: 34. He was buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery at 24th and Diamond Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but his remains and an impressive burial monument were years later removed along with many other graves from this cemetery to Lawnview Memorial Park, an Odd Fellows Cemetery in Rockledge, Pennsylvania, just outside Northeast Philadelphia. His current monument was added by the Brotherhood of the Union. Writing style and response Grave of George Lippard at Lawnview Memorial Park outside of Philadelphia Lippard achieved substantial commercial success in his lifetime by purposely targeting a young working-class readership by using sensationalism, violence, and social criticism.Howe, Daniel Walker. What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815–1848. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007: 631. Lippard acknowledged the influence of Charles Brockden Brown (1771–1810) on his writing and dedicated several books to him. Lippard's writing has occasional glimmers of style, but his words are more memorable for quantity than for quality, and his writing for its financial success than for its literary style. He proved that one could make a living by wordsmithing. If he is remembered at all today, it is more for his social thinking, which was progressive, than for his language and literary style. One contemporary reviewer noted Lippard's efforts as a social critic: \\"It was his business to attack social wrongs, to drag away purple garments, and expose to our shivering gaze the rottenness of vice—to take tyranny by the throat and strangle it to death.\\" Nonetheless, years after Lippard's death, Mark Twain mentioned him in a letter to home. During the short time Twain spent in Philadelphia working for The Philadelphia Inquirer, he wrote: \\"Unlike New York, I like this Philadelphia amazingly, and the people in it . . . . I saw small steamboats, with their signs up--'For Wissahickon and Manayunk 25 cents.' Geo. Lippard, in his Legends of Washington and his Generals, has rendered the Wissahickon sacred in my eyes, and I shall make that trip, as well as one to Germantown, soon . . . .\\" Many of Lippard's fictions were received as historical fact. Probably the most famous person to quote a historical romance by George Lippard as though it were actual history is the late President Ronald Reagan, in a commencement address at Eureka College on June 7, 1957.\\"The Unknown Patriot\\" Retrieved on 2 January 2015. Reagan quoted from George Lippard's \\"Speech of the Unknown\\" in Washington and His Generals: or, Legends of the Revolution (1847), which relates how a speech by an anonymous delegate was the final motivation that spurred delegates to sign the Declaration of Independence in 1776. After Lippard became successful as a novelist, he tried to use popular literature as a vehicle for social reform.Streeby, Shelley.

History The throne was built in 1605 in Allahabad and kept at the Allahabad Fort. Even after Jahangir became king when his father, emperor Akbar died in 1605, the throne remained there. It was only in 1610, that it was brought from Allahabad to Agra by Jahangir. When the Army of the British East India Company first attacked the Agra Fort in 1803 under General Gerard Lake, a cannonball fired by the artillery struck the Takht, but did not manage to destroy it. It caused a superficial crack on one side and bounced on to make a hole through the wall opposite the throne . Structure The throne was made of black onyx, imported by Jahangir from Belgium. It is 10 feet 7 inches long, 9 feet 10 inches broad and 6 inches thick. Its octagonal pedestals are each 1 foot 4 inches in height. At the top, it gently slopes from the centre to the sides like the shell of a tortoise. Persian inscriptions, dated 1602 are carved, in ornamental cartouches on its sides, in praise of Jahangir, whom they state as Shah and Sultan. This amounted to defiance of Akbar, who was at that time alive and on the throne. When the throne was finally brought to Agra, Jahangir had two inscriptions carved on top of the two western pedestals, stating that he had been only the heir to the throne, and that he had assumed the title of Nuruddin Muhammad Jahangir Badshah (Badshah Jahangir), only after his righteous accession. Nyaya ke Zanjeer Behind the Takht-i-Jahangir were Jahangir's Nyaya ke Zanjeer (Chains of Truth), which consisted of 60 metal bells. If anybody, regardless of their position, desired justice, they could pull the chains to make the bells ring, and they were sure to be granted justice.

It also touches on other end-of-life issues for the terminally ill. The cast includes Rentarō Mikuni (Buhei Mikai, the film director), Masahiko Tsugawa (Doctor Ogata) and Nobuko Miyamoto (Buhei's wife).

After he vomits blood when he is with his mistress, Buhei's wife takes him to the hospital, where the doctor diagnoses him with terminal cancer and operates on his stomach. However, he withholds this information from Buhei, and tells him he has an ulcer. After a remission, Buhei again becomes ill, is operated on for a second time, and is confined to hospital. Gradually he guesses that he must be suffering from cancer, despite constant reassurances to the contrary from his wife and doctor. After a suicide attempt, the doctor and wife decide to tell him the truth. After wrestling with his conscience, Dr Ogata also allows Buhei to direct the final scene of his film, even though the effort will shorten his life, and agrees not to administer drugs that would prolong his life at the cost of more pain and suffering. Buhei completes his film. He tells the doctor how grateful he is that he was honest about his condition and could live his final weeks to the full.

Early life Prince was born in Nichols, New York, the son of Myrtle Jane (née Osborne), a nurse, and Miles Gorman Prince, who worked in sales. Prince attended Cornell University, which he left in his senior year to join a Federal Theatre tour of The Taming of the Shrew. He served an apprenticeship with the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia, making his New York debut with the company in 1937 in its production of Max Reinhardt's Eternal Road. He then joined Maurice Evans's company, appearing in minor Shakespearean roles. Career His star began to rise after actress Eva Le Gallienne, responding to a pleading letter, gave him an audition for the part of 'Richard' in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness! He got the part and caught the eye of the critics. His breakthrough came a year later, in 1942, with the role of Private Quizz West in Maxwell Anderson's play The Eve of St. Mark. He was soon signed to a Hollywood contract, and appeared in Destination Tokyo, Objective Burma, and Dead Reckoning, among the first of many films to come in his lifetime. After a mostly undistinguished movie career in the late 1940s, Prince worked primarily in television the following decade, having moved back to New York in the interim. It was there, in 1947, that Prince became one of the founding members of The Actors Studio. Over the next decade, he made numerous appearances on anthology drama series such as Studio One, Philco Television Playhouse, and Armstrong Circle Theatre, and in 1955, Prince co-starred with Gary Merrill in the second season of Justice, an NBC drama about lawyers of the Legal Aid Society of New York. Prince had roles on several soap operas, including one of the lead roles on Young Dr. Malone from 1958 to 1963, Another World, As the World Turns, The Edge of Night, Search for Tomorrow and A World Apart, often appearing with his actress wife Augusta Dabney (former wife of actor Kevin McCarthy). Two of his most notable film roles were as Christian de Neuvillette in the 1950 Cyrano de Bergerac, and as network president Edward Ruddy in Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 film classic, Network. He also gained critical acclaim for his portrayal of patriarch Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy in the 1977 teleplay \\"Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye\\". Returning to Broadway, he took leading roles in John Loves Mary and Forward the Heart. He appeared as Orlando in As You Like It, with Katharine Hepburn, and as Christopher Isherwood in I Am a Camera. In 1963, he played Charles Marsden in the Actors Studio production of Strange Interlude. He took leading roles in several plays by Edward Albee, beginning with The Ballad of the Sad Cafe in 1963. He understudied \\"Charlie\\" in the Broadway production of Seascape (1975), co-starred in the Hartford Stage Company's 1976 revival of All Over, appeared opposite Angela Lansbury in Counting the Ways and Listening in 1977, and played the title role in the short-lived The Man Who Had Three Arms in 1983. During the 1970s, 1980s and into the early 1990s, Prince made guest appearances on dozens of primetime television series and miniseries including Captains and the Kings (1976), Aspen (1977), and George Washington (1984). He also reunited with Cyrano star Jose Ferrer for the made-for-television films The Rhinemann Exchange (1977) and Gideon's Trumpet (1980). In the latter, Ferrer played attorney for petitioner Gideon, Abe Fortas, and Prince was seen as one of the Supreme Court Justices. In 1992 he appeared on the long-running NBC drama Law & Order in the episode \\"The Working Stiff\\", playing a corrupt former governor involved in a banking scandal. Personal life William Prince died October 8, 1996, at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, New York. He was 83, and lived in Dobbs Ferry, New York at the time of his death. Prince was survived by his wife, Augusta Dabney Prince (who died in February 2008); a sister, Charlotte; two daughters, Liza and Dinah; two sons, Nicholas and Jeremy; and three grandchildren.

The word Amathole means ‘calves’ in Xhosa, and Amathole District Municipality, which lies to the south, is named after these mountains. Geology The Amathole Mountains form part of the southern portion of the Great Escarpment, rising over 1,800 metres above sea level. The escarpment slopes are densely covered in ancient forests of yellowwoods, white stinkwoods, Cape chestnuts and other indigenous trees. Deep indigenous woods like Kologha and Kubusie are some of the largest swaths of forest in South Africa. The mountains are capped with flower-rich montane grassland. Albany thickets also feature prominently in the surrounding area. The mountains are famous for their scenic beauty with lush forests, ravines, waterfalls and panoramic views. The six-day Amatola hiking trail is one of the top hiking trails in South Africa. The Amatola Mountains’ geology is characterised by the Beaufort Group (subdivided into the Tarkastad and Adelaide subgroups), which forms part of the Karoo sequence. The sediments were formed by depositions in river channels, floodplains and swamps. History and Settlement These mountains were originally home to the Khoisan hunter gatherers. The Nguni migrations saw the arrival of the Xhosa herders from the north and the displacement of the Khoisan inhabitants during the mid- to late 17th century CE. Many of the current settlements in the Amathole region started as military outposts, for example Adelaide, Cathcart and Fort Beaufort. This is because, in the 19th Century, this region formed the border between the Cape Colony, and the Xhosa nation to the east. Frequent wars were fought along this border, particularly the 7th Frontier War (Also known as the Amatola War or the 'War of the Axe'). These wars were usually fought over farming land, cattle theft and legal jurisdiction and they saw the steady movement of the Cape's border eastward, into Xhosa lands. It was into the Amatola mountains’ forested ravines that the Xhosa armies retreated after the setbacks of these wars, so the Cape built the military towns in an effort to secure these borderlands for its farmers. Interesting towns Tyhume valley and the view to the Hogsback pass in the mountains. *King William's Town is the old centre of the region. In this city there is a large museum, the Amathole Museum, with old collections. *At the foot of the mountains, in the town of Alice, is the campus of the University of Fort Hare. *Stutterheim, beneath the Kologha range to the east, initially served as a settlement for disbanded soldiers who had fought in the 'Amatola War'. *Hogsback's first residents were farmers. This town is a very popular holiday destination that is reputed to have inspired Tolkien's Middle Earth. *The nearby town of East London is the largest in the region and is South Africa's only river port.

It aims to improve road capacity by encouraging people to use buses. RAPID is built upon Brisbane City Council's BLISS ITS platform and uses existing traffic signal infrastructure to track the buses and to lower communications costs. RAPID uses detector loops in the road and transponders on buses to track the location of buses on the road and busway network. The data collected is used in a complex mathematical formula to predict the arrival time of buses at all busway stations and selected stops on the suburban network. The predicted arrival times are displayed on electronic signs for the information of people waiting at these stops. Operations staff are able to use the system to identify the precise location of buses within the road network. Specifically the system displays bus numbers, route numbers, driver numbers, how early or late a bus is, where it originated and where it will terminate. The system also has the ability, when configured, to provide traffic light priority to buses if they are running late. This is possible because the same detection loops in the road network are used to control the traffic lights throughout the city. The system has had significant problems, with information displays frequently being inaccurate, and buses simply not arriving, or their information simply disappearing from the screens.

In 1942 a part of Botne with 148 inhabitants was moved to Holmestrand, and in 1947 a part with 8 inhabitants was moved to Våle. On 1 January 1964 the rest of Botne was incorporated into Holmestrand. Prior to the merger Botne had a population of 5,656. The name The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old farm Botne (Norse Botnar), since the first church was built there. The name is the plural form of botn m 'bottom, hollow, depression'. Baptismal font Botne Church Botne Church (Botne kirke) is a stone church. It dates from the 13th century. The church is dedicated to St. Nicholas. There is rectangular nave and lower and narrower choir. The Renaissance / Baroque altarpiece is from 1664 and consists of four pictures from the gospels. The pulpit is from 1634 with five subjects with evangelists and painted in large fields. The baptismal font is also from the 1600s and has an octagonal basin with painted biblical scenes on four sides. Botne church was expanded in 1865 and restored in 1947. In 1865 the ridge turret was replaced by a tower in the west and with a gable roof at the east end of the choir. The ceiling was paneled, new hardwood floors replaced the stone floor, new gallery at the west wall, larger gallery at the north wall and new benches. During a restoration in 1947, the chancel screen and the north gallery were removed and west gallery was renewed. The church got a new altar and paintings on the north wall were uncovered.

At its completion in 1929, was the largest building in the world without interior supports.  Description  The building has a unique shape which has been described as \\"half a silkworm's cocoon, cut in half the long way.\\" It is 1,175 feet (358.14 m) long, 325 feet (99.06 m) wide, and 211 feet (64.31 m) high, supported by 13 steel arches. There is 364,000 square feet (34 000 m²) of unobstructed floor space, or an area larger than 8 football fields side-by- side. The airdock has a volume of 55 million cubic feet (or about 1.5 million cubic meters). A control tower and radio aerial sit at its northeast end. At each end of the building are two huge semi-spherical doors that each weigh 600 tons (544 000 kg). At the top, the doors are fastened by hollow forged pins 17 inches (43 cm) in diameter and six feet (1.83 m) long. The doors roll on 40 wheels along specially-designed curved railroad tracks, each powered by an individual power plant that can open the doors in about 5 minutes.\\"A Nine Acre Nest For Dirigibles.\\" Popular Science Monthly, September 1929, p. 20. The airdock is so large that temperature changes within the structure can be very different from that on the outside of the structure. To accommodate these fluctuations, which could cause structural damage, a row of 12 windows 100 feet (30.48 m) off the ground was installed. Furthermore, the entire structure is mounted on rollers to compensate for expansion or contraction resulting from temperature changes. When the humidity is high in the Airdock, a sudden change in temperature causes condensation. This condensation falls in a mist, creating the illusion of rain, according to the designer. History The U.S. Navy airship under construction at the Goodyear Airdock in 1932. In 1929, Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation, later Goodyear Aerospace, sought a structure in which \\"lighter-than-air\\" ships (later known as airships, dirigibles, and blimps) could be constructed. The company commissioned Karl Arnstein of Akron, Ohio, whose design was inspired by the blueprints of the first aerodynamic- shaped airship hangar, built in 1913 in Dresden, Germany.Roland Fuhrmann (2019). \\"Dresden’s gateway to the skies: the world’s first streamlined airship hangar and its influence on architectural history\\", Thelem Universitätsverlag Dresden, 2019, . Construction took place from April 20 to November 25, 1929, at a cost of $2.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The first two airships to be constructed and launched at the airdock were USS Akron (ZRS-4), in 1931, and its sister ship, USS Macon (ZRS-5), in 1933. They were about 785 feet (239.27 m) long. When World War II broke out, enclosed production areas were desperately needed, and the airdock was used for building airships. The last airship built in the airdock was the U.S. Navy's ZPG-3W in 1960. The building later housed the photographic division of the Goodyear Aerospace Corporation. In 1980, the Goodyear Airdock was designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Interior of the Goodyear Airdock, May 1985 The airdock has more recently served as the site of the 1986 kickoff rally for the United Way of Summit County, where 200,000 members of the public visited. Bill Clinton spoke there during his 1992 election campaign, bringing some 30,000 visitors to the site. In 1987, the Loral Corporation purchased Goodyear Aerospace and the Goodyear Airdock as a result of James Goldsmith's greenmailing of Goodyear. The Loral Corporation (and its holdings, including the Goodyear Airdock) was purchased by Lockheed Martin in 1996. The airdock is not open to the public, but it can be seen by those traveling on U.S. Route 224 east of downtown Akron.

In International Color Consortium (ICC) terms, this is the basis for an additional color characterization of the device and later profiling. In non-ICC workflows, calibration refers sometimes to establishing a known relationship to a standard color space in one go. The device that is to be calibrated is sometimes known as a calibration source; the color space that serves as a standard is sometimes known as a calibration target. Color calibration is a requirement for all devices taking an active part of a color-managed workflow, and is used by many industries, such as television production, gaming, photography, engineering, chemistry, medicine and more.  Information flow and output distortion  Input data can come from device sources like digital cameras, image scanners or any other measuring devices. Those inputs can be either monochrome (in which case only the response curve needs to be calibrated, though in a few select cases one must also specify the color or spectral power distribution that that single channel corresponds to) or specified in multidimensional color - most commonly in the three channel red-green-blue model. Input data is in most cases calibrated against a profile connection space (PCS). One of the most important factors to consider when dealing with color calibration is having a valid source. If the color measuring source does not match the displays capabilities, the calibration will be ineffective and give false readings. The main distorting factors on the input stage stem from the amplitude nonlinearity of the channel responses, and in the case of a multidimensional datastream the non-ideal wavelength responses of the individual color separation filters, most commonly a color filter array, in combination with the spectral power distribution of the scene illumination. After this the data is often circulated in the system translated into a working space RGB for viewing and editing. In the output stage when exporting to a viewing device such as a cathode ray tube or liquid crystal display screen or a digital projector, the computer sends a signal to the computer's graphic card in the form RGB [Red, Green, Blue]. The dataset [255,0,0] signals only a device instruction, not a specific color. This instruction [R,G,B]=[255,0,0] then causes the connected display to show Red at the maximum achievable brightness [255], while the Green and Blue components of the display remain dark [0]. The resultant color being displayed, however, depends on two main factors: *the phosphors or another system actually producing a light that falls inside the red spectrum; *the overall brightness of the color resulting in the desired color perception: an extremely bright light source will always be seen as white, irrespective of spectral composition. Hence every output device will have its unique color signature, displaying a certain color according to manufacturing tolerances and material deterioration through use and age. If the output device is a printer, additional distorting factors are the qualities of a particular batch of paper and ink. The conductive qualities and standards-compliance of connecting cables, circuitry and equipment can also alter the electrical signal at any stage in the signal flow. (A partially inserted VGA connector can result in a monochrome display, for example, as some pins are not connected.)  Color perception  Color perception is subject to ambient light levels, and the ambient white point; for example, a red object looks black in blue light. It is therefore not possible to achieve calibration that will make a device look correct and consistent in all capture or viewing conditions. The computer display and calibration target will have to be considered in controlled, predefined lighting conditions. Calibration techniques and procedures Calibration Target of the \\"Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)\\" on the Mars Curiosity rover (September 9, 2012) (3-D image). The most common form of calibration aims at adjusting cameras, scanners, monitors and printers for photographic reproduction. The aim is that a printed copy of a photograph appear identical in saturation and dynamic range to the original or a source file on a computer display. This means that three independent calibrations need to be performed: * The camera or scanner needs a device- specific calibration to represent the original's estimated colors in an unambiguous way. * The computer display needs a device-specific calibration to reproduce the colors of the image color space. * The printer needs a device- specific calibration to reproduce the colors of the image color space. These goals can either be realized via direct value translation from source to target, or by using a common known reference color space as middle ground. In the most commonly used color profile system, ICC, this is known as the PCS or \\"Profile Connection Space\\".  Camera  The camera calibration needs a known calibration target to be photographed and the resulting output from the camera to be converted to color values. A correction profile can then be built using the difference between the camera result values and the known reference values. When two or more cameras need to be calibrated relatively to each other, to reproduce the same color values, the technique of color mapping can be used.  Scanner  An IT8.7 Target by LaserSoft Imaging For creating a scanner profile it needs a target source, such as an IT8-target, an original with many small color fields, which was measured by the developer with a photometer. The scanner reads this original and compares the scanned color values with the target's reference values. Taking the differences of these values into account an ICC profile is created, which relates the device specific color space (RGB color space) to a device independent color space (L*a*b* color space). Thus, the scanner is able to output with color fidelity to what it reads.  Display  Color calibration of a monitor using ColorHug2, an open source colorimeter, placed on the screen. For calibrating the monitor a colorimeter is attached flat to the display's surface, shielded from all ambient light. The calibration software sends a series of color signals to the display and compares the values that were actually sent against the readings from the calibration device. This establishes the current offsets in color display. Depending on the calibration software and type of monitor used, the software either creates a correction matrix (i.e. an ICC profile) for color values before being sent to the display, or gives instructions for altering the display's brightness/contrast and RGB values through the OSD. This tunes the display to reproduce fairly accurately the in-gamut part of a desired color space. The calibration target for this kind of calibration is that of print stock paper illuminated by D65 light at 120 cd/m2.  Printer  The ICC profile for a printer is created by comparing a test print result using a photometer with the original reference file. The testchart contains known CMYK colors, whose offsets to their actual L*a*b* colors scanned by the photometer are resulting in an ICC profile. Another possibility to ICC profile a printer is to use a calibrated scanner as the measuring device for the printed CMYK testchart instead of a photometer. A calibration profile is necessary for each printer/paper/ink combination.

It was developed by Psygnosis Camden Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment in Europe and Midway Games in North America. Plot The game is set in Buddie World, a peaceful world inhabited by pill- shaped creatures called \\"Buddies\\". One day, an eclipse occurs, and crates fall from the sky. After finding weapons inside the crates, the Buddies are segregated by colour and begin fighting for supremacy. As the violence spills into other regions of Buddie World, the player learns that the other teams are being assisted by a scientist called Doctor Madasalorrie, who has also been experimenting on animals in Buddie World. The player eventually meets Madasalorrie and persuades him to defect. However, he later goes missing and is presumed dead after failing to destroy an enemy-run factory, forcing the player to complete his mission. It is later revealed that the crates came from the Baddie Moon, which is inhabited by cube-shaped creatures called \\"Baddies\\". The Baddies dropped the crates to Buddie World and filmed the ensuing carnage for a television show. The player travels to the Baddie Moon and is tasked by the president of Buddie World with killing the Baddies and destroying their capital city, which is the source of the crates. The player later learns that Madasalorrie is still alive and is a Baddie disguised as a Buddie. He helped boost the ratings of the Baddies' TV show by having the Buddies kill each other with more lethal weapons. The season finale of the show involves Madasalorrie using a death ray to destroy Buddie World. The player kills Madasalorrie, rescues the moon's aliens before the moon's largest volcano erupts, and destroys Madasalorrie's most powerful killing machine, restoring peace and order to Buddie World. Gameplay The player, as a blue Buddy, has shot a tree using a tank, to release a health pick-up. The game is a mix of Worms' humour and a typical real-time strategy game. Central to the game's theme is the ability of a team of buddies to stack crates in a 2×2×2 pad located in their starting area. Stacking the crates in different ways make different items when the resulting larger crate is broken; for example, a single crate on a stacking pad produces a light weapon, four crates positioned horizontally makes a heavy weapon, and filling the pad creates a vehicle. The battle toys created are based on the selected world, and there are eight original worlds, plus many special sets unlocked once players complete story mode. Most vehicles can carry two crates, but larger vehicles (and the golf cart) can carry three. Up to three additional team members can also be created by stacking crates directly on top of each other; these new \\"buddies\\" can be commanded to attack or defend a certain area or even build on the stacking pad on their own. The player can swap between any of the buddies under his or her control in order to make use of that particular unit's powers or weapons. In addition to a stacking pad, each starting point has a large base building which can be attacked and destroyed. If a base is destroyed, the stacking pad for that team can no longer be used; this means that new members cannot be created, making destroying the base a top priority for securing victory. A team without a base is also unable to build new weapons and must rely on those dropped by the enemy or found around the map (although a fast unit can steal a weapon from an enemy pad as it is being opened). A typical map will have various \\"crate drop\\" areas (in most cases a small area at the players base and a much larger spawn in the middle of the map), where the crates used to build weapons and team-mates fall from the sky. Most crates in the game are yellow with red borders, but yellow crates with blue borders also drop from time to time. Adding one of these to a crate formation causes the object or unit created by it to have increased abilities; for example, a higher rate of fire or range for a weapon or more hit points for a unit or vehicle. In certain maps, mega-crates also drop if certain conditions are met; these large, grey and yellow crates contain a weapon or vehicle not normally found in that particular area, and can be towed behind a Mech, but not behind other vehicles. Team Buddies also supports split-screen multi-player for up to four players. There are several different game types in multi-player: Deathmatch A straightforward game type in which all the members of all opposing teams must be eliminated to win. If there are two or more human players and three or more players overall, the rabanete option can be turned on (unlocked after beating the game). In this mode, the last member of a completely eliminated team remains in play as a slow-moving, invisible ghost. If the ghost walks into the smoking boots of a recently killed unit, it is resurrected and can continue to stack crates and attack enemies. Domination Around the map are \\"domination points,\\" which can be anything, from ankhs to trees, that must be captured in order to achieve victory. Holding a domination point for 5 seconds gives a team a point; multiple domination points grant multiple points, and the first team to reach the required number of points wins. In the event of time running out, the team with the highest number of points wins. Domination points are captured simply by touching them. Teams cannot be eliminated in a Domination match; if all members of a team are destroyed, another unit of the lowest type spawns at their stacking pad, armed with the lowest available weapon if the pad has been deactivated. Capture Similar to capture the flag, this game type requires teams to steal animals from an enemy's pen and return them to their own pen. Animals include dogs, penguins, pigs, and sheep. Animals must be stunned with an attack before picking them up (animals cannot be killed in multi-player). The animals will attempt to break free if carried (even by their own team) and return to their pen. Shooting a unit carrying an animal causes it to drop the animal. Ten points are awarded for capturing the enemies animal, with five bonus points awarded if your team still has their animal. Bomball An explosive grey ball is spawned at the centre of the arena. Each team has three members armed with the lowest weapon of the game's chosen weapon set; if killed, an identical one will spawn shortly after. The goal of the game is to carry the ball to an enemy goal and throw it between the two goalposts. Once a ball is thrown, a timer begins to count down; once the timer reaches zero, the ball explodes, dealing damage to any nearby buddies. One point is awarded for throwing the ball through a set of goalposts, and additional six points are given for a ball exploding in the goal area immediately behind them. Style One of the distinctive aspects of Team Buddies is its visual style and choice of dialogue. Censorship in the United States caused the game's vulgar and stereotyped character dialogue originally used for characters to be toned down. The European version of the game gave each character class different voice identities, and additionally gives each multi-player team colour its own nationality; for example blue team are stereotypical English, whereas purple are 'engrish' style Japanese. All the buddies and various other creatures in the game have pill-shaped bodies and disjointed limbs reminiscent of Rayman, with the exception of the moon- dwelling enemies encountered late in the single-player game. Environments are brightly coloured and angular, gaining most of their detail through texturing rather than more detailed polygons. Nearly all of the weapons encountered are similarly simplistic and usually one or two solid colours and with clear arrows pointing out the way projectiles are fired from them. Terrain darkens and deforms if hit with an explosion, creating fairly realistic craters and scorch marks where a battle has taken place. In multiplayer, a variety of skins can be unlocked to personalize a particular match, including zombie skins, underwear skins and English football uniforms. Reception Team Buddies generally positive reviews from critics. It currently holds a score of 72.36% on GameRankings. IGN's Scott Steinberg gave the game a score of 8.5 out of 10, praising the overall presentation and noting that it is \\"fun, it's original, and it's a little clunky\\" calling it \\"a thinking man's shooter.\\" GameSpot's Frank Provo was considerably more critical, giving the game a score of 4.8 out of 10, saying that \\"no amount of multimedia candy can save this game from its main flaw: boredom.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2000 video games Category:Censored video games Category:Midway video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation (console)-only games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games scored by Alastair Lindsay ","title":"Team Buddies"},{"id":"4432974","text":"Temnikov (; ; ) is a town and the administrative center of Temnikovsky District in the Republic of Mordovia, Russia.

It is currently owned and operated by Norges Varemesse. Oslo Spektrum is primarily known for hosting major events such as the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert, the Eurovision Song Contest 1996, and concerts by artists of national and international fame. Artists such as Toto, Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston, Shirley Bassey, Tina Turner, Cher, Mariah Carey, Diana Ross, Britney Spears, Kylie Minogue, Janet Jackson, Shania Twain, Westlife, Selena Gomez, Christina Aguilera, Anastacia, Spice Girls, Lady Gaga, Michael Bublé, Lana Del Rey, Metallica, Muse, Rammstein, a-ha, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snoop Dogg, Ariana Grande and Marcus & Martinus have performed at the venue.  History = Construction  Oslo Spektrum was part of a large-scale redevelopment of the formerly industrial Grønland/Vaterland area. It was designed by LPO Arkitektkontor AS, and its exterior walls were decorated with ceramic tiles containing fragments of prints by the artist Rolf Nesch. Since this artist died in 1975, permission was obtained from his living relatives, and the decorating was supervised by painter Guttorm Guttormsgaard and ceramic artist Søren Ubisch. In 2004 Oslo Spektrum was awarded the Oslo City Council's award for outstanding architectural achievement.  Opening  At the time of opening it was Norway's largest indoor arena, with a capacity of 9,700 at concerts and 6,500 during sporting events). It has since been expanded several times. In Greater Oslo both Vallhall Arena (capacity 13,000 for concerts/4,000 for sporting events) and Telenor Arena (capacity 25,000/15,000) provide larger venues. Oslo Spektrum was conceived as a multi-purpose arena although it was intended primarily for ice hockey. In this capacity it was intended as the home of both Vålerenga Ishockey and Furuset Ishockey, but this did not work out as expected and the venue was soon left to rely on other means of generating revenue.  Development and renovation  In June 2017, the owner notified Norges Varemesse that they were planning to renovate and expand the arena for more than NOK 1 billion. Among other things, a new congress centre will be built with around 3,000 seats and a total of 20,000 additional square metres. The development is scheduled to start in 2020, and the new centre will be opened in 2023. The goal of the development is to make Oslo better equipped to be Scandinavia's \\"conference capital\\". Today's concert hall, with an audience capacity of approx. 10,000 seats, should be refurbished and include 1,700 extra seats. The renovation work is scheduled to start in the summer of 2019.  Location  Oslo Spektrum (left, next to the Oslo Plaza tower building) One of Oslo Spektrum's prime attributes is its location in the middle of Downtown Oslo, next to the Central Station, long and medium haul bus terminal, Jernbanetorget public transportation hub and only a short distance from international ferry terminals. This makes it easily accessible and minimises traffic problems when crowds arrive at events and disperse afterwards, which has been an issue with other venues such as the more remotely located Telenor Arena.  Events  Oslo Spektrum was designed to accommodate various types of entertainment shows and sporting events. It has built-in ice making facilities, and while it is rarely used for ice hockey, it regularly hosts ice shows like Walt Disney's World on Ice. It also hosts the Norwegian Handball Championships, for a period becoming Norway's largest handball arena. Other notable events that are regularly held here include the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, Norwegian Idol finals, Spellemannsprisen (Norwegian music awards), and the Oslo Horse Show. Currently, Spektrum hosts a total of 100 events annually, with some 400,000 visitors. Of these, 70% are concerts by major national and international artists, 10% are other types of entertainment shows, 13% are fairs, conferences and corporate events, and only 3% are sporting events. Oslo Spektrum hosted the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest which was won by Ireland.

This event actually consisted of two sieges. When Hideyoshi came to attack Kanie castle, it was held by Maeda Tanetoshi on behalf of the Oda. However, Hideyoshi had pardoned Maeda's cousin Takigawa Kazumasu for his support of Shibata Katsuie, and as a result Kazumasu was an ally of Hideyoshi. He convinced his cousin Maeda to switch sides, joining Hideyoshi and giving up the castle to him. The new allies then attempted to attack nearby Ono castle, but were repulsed when the defenders threw torches into the attackers' boats. Returning to Kanie castle, Hideyoshi and Maeda came under siege from forces loyal to the Oda and Sakakibara clans, on behalf of the alliance between the Oda and Tokugawa Ieyasu. They pushed through the castle's outer defenses, and negotiated a surrender contingent on the besiegers being given Maeda's head.

It is the administrative center of Staryi Sambir Raion (district). Its population is approximately . History The exact date of establishment of the town is not known. Sambir, known in Polish as Sambor, was for the first time mentioned in documents in 1378. At that time, it was a private town of the noble Herburt family, part of Przemysl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship, Kingdom of Poland. In 1501, a Roman Catholic church was opened here, and in 1553, Sambir received a town charter. In 1668, a town hall was built here, and in the early 18th century, the local church was remodelled. Until 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), Sambir belonged to Przemysl Land, Ruthenian Voivodeship. From 1772 until late 1918, Sambir belonged to Austrian Galicia. In 1880, its population was 3,482, with 1,399 Greek-Catholics, 704 Roman Catholics, and 1,377 Jews. During the Polish-Ukrainian War, Sambir was seized by the Poles whose possession of the town was confirmed in the Peace of Riga. According to the 1921 census, the town had a population of 4,314, with 1,534 Jews. In the Second Polish Republic, it was the seat of a county in Lwow Voivodeship (until 1932). After the 1939 invasion of Poland, the town was annexed into the Soviet Union. Its Jewish residents were murdered in the Holocaust. In the immediate postwar period, the remaining ethnic Poles were expelled. Most of them settled in the Recovered Territories. Ukrainians were resettled following Operation Vistula.

It is a large military site and is situated north of the A48 road five miles (8 km) west of Chepstow and east of Newport. Since 1993 it has been used for a variety of military and civil purposes, including field exercises, car rallying, storage and breakdown of railway vehicles, nature preservation, and playing Airsoft. The site has its own standard gauge railway system (no longer linked to the national network), many private roads and a wide range of buildings, from small earth-banked stores to large four storey lightly built brick buildings. It is about two miles (3 km) east-west, and north-south. The perimeter road inside the security fence is, on its own, over seven miles (11 km) long. 1939 to 1965 The site was created as a Royal Navy propellants factory in 1939. Note: The Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent, like the Royal Navy Cordite Factory, Holton Heath, was never part of the Ministry of Supply/Royal Ordnance Factory management chain; they were controlled by the Admiralty. However, they were functionally very similar to Explosive ROFs. In the summer of 1936 the site requirements for a new factory were drawn up. The main priorities were: *the establishment should not be vulnerable to air attack; *should not be located in an industrial area, but sufficiently close to a populated area to provide an adequate workforce; *should be close to a railway and to main roads; *should be located on rough grassland with a gravel on sand subsoil with good natural drainage and a slope of about 1 in 30 to provide maximum safety in the highly dangerous nitroglycerine manufacturing and handling areas; *the higher part should not have an elevation of not less than above the lowest part to limit the internal gradients. Like all explosive factories of this type, a capacious supply of water was required for use in the manufacturing processes. To manufacture 150 tons of cordite per week the factory would need 3 million imperial gallons (14,000 m³) of drinking quality water per day. In the final quarter of 19th century, the Great Western Railway (GWR) had undertaken the engineering feat of constructing the Severn Tunnel under the River Severn.Walker (1888). One of the major difficulties encountered underground was the 'Great Spring', which necessitated the pumping of over 9 million gallons (41,000 m³) of water per day, at Sudbrook, from the western end of the tunnel, conveniently located only three miles (5 km) away from the proposed site at Caerwent.Walker (1888), Chapter 10: \\"The Means Taken to Deal with the Great Spring\\". Even during the great drought of 1934 the lowest daily return was 9.1 million imperial gallons (41,000 m³). The GWR used about 1.5 million imperial gallons (6,800 m³) per day themselves, so there was always a guaranteed daily surplus of 7.5 million imperial gallons (34,000 m³). The total area acquired was of land, a total of were enclosed within the factory fence. It was connected to the Great Western railway at Caldicot Junction, near Sudbrook by way of a private branch line, sometimes known as the MoD Caerwent sidings; and a number of transfer sidings were laid out inside the factory fence. The site consumed the village of Dinham which was located at the northern edge of the RNPF Caerwent. By the end of 1940 the Main Office block was complete, and in December of that year the Unit 1 Sulphuric Acid Factory went into production with acid mixing for the Nitrocellulose and Nitroglycerine manufacturing. Five months later, the Pressure Oxidation Plant for the manufacture of Nitric acid came on stream. In August 1941 the Nitrocellulose and Nitroglycerine plants were operational and were soon working 24 hours a day on a three-shift pattern. At the same time, Unit 2 of the factory was almost completed, so RNPF Caerwent was now virtually operational. A total of £4.7 million was spent on buildings and roads, and £2.5 million on plant and equipment. From 1955 to 1966, Caerwent produced the Gosling solid rocket booster for the Seaslug missile. This work began in wartime buildings, the horizontal presses in Press Houses 3 and a longer press in 1, and with other work in a disused blending house and the Tetryl Acetone Recovery building. From 1957 dedicated buildings, J1...J6, were constructed on the eastern side of the site for the production of guided weapons propellants. Buildings J7...J9 at the northern edge of the site formed a static testing site, where these motors could be test-fired. J7 was an environmental conditioning building where charges could be heated to 70°C or cooled to -40°C before testing. These buildings were of typical flat-roofed red brick construction, shielded by large earth traverses. Testing work was also carried out here on the Magpie, Redtop and Sealyham rocket motors. Early in the 1960s a Parliamentary working party recommended that propellants for the three branches of the armed services should be concentrated at the Royal Ordnance Factory at Bishopton. The decision to close RNPF Caerwent was announced on 25 March 1965. Production continued during the following two-year rundown phase. The last Gosling motor was produced in 14 June 1966, tooling then being transferred to Bishopston. RAF Caerwent - weapons storage 1967-1993 RAF Caerwent was transferred to US administration after Charles de Gaulle expelled the US military from France in 1967. Caerwent thus became part of the US Army European 'theatre reserve stocks' under the command of the United States Army's \\"47th Area Support Group Reserve Storage Activity\\", and became known as USADA Caerwent (United States Arms Depot Activity - Caerwent) with a Royal Air Force Liaison Party also present. The US Army spent over £4 million constructing 300 magazines and converting some of the former RNPF structures to conform to the required specification. The material stored included small arms ammunition, artillery shells (up to 8\\"), anti-tank mines, grenades, flares, and the multiple launch rocket system. The first shipments of shells, rockets, mines, flares and small arms ammo arrived early in 1968 with shipments arriving in lorry convoys as well as rail. The majority of lorry convoys took place at night not to cause local road disruption, along with the freight trains, as they had to fit with BR timetables. In the early 1960s Severn Tunnel locomotive depot was not far away and steam locomotive no. 2231 was allocated as a permanent locomotive for shunting etc. at Caerwent (Dinham). This locomotive had a special spark arrestor fitted in the smoke box at Swindon to avoid sparks being blown and causing a fire hazard. The driver and fireman were forbidden to smoke at any time whilst inside the perimeter gate. Maintenance facilities were added in 1971. In the early 1970s the site's capacity was expanded substantially, which allowed the closure of three other munitions bases in the West Midlands (Bramshall, Ditton Priors and RAF Fauld) in 1973. One of the reasons Caerwent was retained was its proximity to Barry Docks where many of the armaments entered the United Kingdom. At this time there was also an increase of US army staff, with many of them stationed at Caerwent for a short period of time after serving in Germany and prior to returning home stateside. There were also parties, film shows in the on-site cinema and barbecues were held for the families of local people to show them appreciation for working with the US army. At its height Caerwent was among the larger ammunition supply depots in Western Europe, storing over 80,000 tonnes of conventional munitions, a substantial fraction of the US Army's European stocks. In 1990 Caerwent shipped 12,000 tons of ammunition to the Middle East and played a critical part in Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Following the change in the political climate in Europe and subsequent scaling down of operations, the US Army announced it was to close down their storage operations at the establishment in June 1992. Over 60,000 tonnes of munitions were moved out over a period of less than ten months. The last batch was removed by train on 19 July 1993. The formal closure ceremony took place on 20 August 1993. Present day The base is now maintained by a small army staff as a 'Training Area' for troops from Beachley Barracks and further afield. A 'representative sample' of the bomb storage and processing structures of this vast site can now be seen on the latest Ordnance Survey map showing roughly 200 structures. Previous editions showed the site as completely blank, but serviced by a railway line. Caerwent is now a major training area covering over , capable of sustaining up to 1,000 troops. There are not only over 400 buildings and bunkers on the site, but also an operating railway (removed 2005-2006) and a comprehensive road system, for logistics exercises and driver training. The site has been used for military training and public order training by various police forces. Local farmers are allowed to graze their livestock on the convenient areas of pasture that separate the former factory buildings. Parts of the site have also been let for civilian usage, including driver training and car rallying run by Forresters Car Club and. Part of the site is also used by an airsoft club, under the name Dragon Valley The relay races of the 2007 JK Orienteering Festival were held on the site. Since the privatisation of British Rail, RNPF Caerwent like a number of other MOD sites with internal railway sidings, has been used as a secure storage area for holding surplus locomotives and rolling stock that might be returned to use. A small number of electric locomotives, particularly in the British Rail Class 86 and British Rail Class 87, have been scrapped at RNPF Caerwent; also, British Rail Mark 2 carriages. In 1995 the site was used in the Channel4 programme Scrapheap Challenge series, utilising the railway scrap yard facilities to create electric, diesel and steam powered railway locomotives. Scenes from two episodes of science fiction television series Torchwood were also filmed on the base, as were scenes in the 2006 film Big Nothing, starring David Schwimmer and Simon Pegg. Scenes from the Hollywood blockbuster Captain America: The First Avenger were filmed on site in October 2010. More recently, Caerwent was used in the television series Top Gear.

In diving, this is known as reverse rotation (as opposed to front, back, or inward). Many stunt performers and martial artists are capable of performing a similar skill on the ground, sometimes in combination with a midair inverted kick. A half gainer involves the same motion, except the ending position is with the head downward. A half gainer can also be performed starting with walking on the hands and ending with the head upwards, although this is quite difficult. In gymnastics, the maneuver is performed while standing on the side of a balance beam by kicking one foot forwards while flipping backwards. A professional wrestling move called a shooting star press is very similar to a gainer, as it involves a wrestler performing a variation of a gainer from a standing position, onto an opponent (causing the wrestler to land chest first). This maneuver has many variations, ranging from different locations, different tuck styles/turns and also additional degrees of rotation, however the standard shooting star press is essentially a gainer.

The event currently carries a purse of $150,000. History The event was inaugurated on 30 October 1967 as the Balboa Stakes with split divisions on the final day of the Del Mar 62 day racing season which went into the deep autumn. The event was for three-year-olds and older, and held on the turf over a distance of nine furlongs. The name reflected to several namings of Balboa in the area - Balboa Park in nearly San Diego, Balboa Peninsula up the coast in Newport Beach, and Balboa Avenue in Del Mar which is located adjacent to the Del Mar Fairgrounds which are all in honor of the Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa. The event was not run again until 1972 when conditions changed so that two-year- olds would run over a distance of furlongs. In 1974, the event was moved to the dirt track and run over the one mile distance. In 1983 the event was classified as Grade III and was upgraded to Grade II in 2003. In 1995 the event was renamed to honor Best Pal, a three time California Horse of the Year who won the Balboa Stakes in 1990 and whose career earnings totaled more than $5.6 million for his owner-breeder, Golden Eagle Farm. The event has had several distance changes with last being in 2018 when the journey was set at six furlongs. The event's position in the racing calendar at Del Mar has lead to the race being a preparatory race for the Del Mar Futurity which is scheduled usually several weeks later. Other notable winners of this event include the 1994 winner Timber Country who went on that year to win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was crowned US Champion Two-Year-Old Horse who the following year became the first horse to ever win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and American Triple Crown Classic Race when he won the 1995 Preakness Stakes. Also the 2009 winner Lookin at Lucky was crowned US Champion Two-Year-Old Horse and the following year also won the 2010 Preakness Stakes. The 2015 winner Nyquist followed up winning the Del Mar Futurity and the Breeders' Cup Juvenile also being crowned the US Champion Two-Year-Old Horse and the following year winning the 2016 Kentucky Derby.

Hirsch Stakes is a Grade I American Thoroughbred horse race for fillies and mares age three years and older over a distance of one and one- sixteenth miles on the dirt track, scheduled annually in late July or early August at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California. The event currently carries a purse of $250,000. History The event was inaugurated as the Chula Vista Handicap on 17 July 1937 as a five and one-half furlong race for two-year-olds bred in California and was won by High Strike owned by singer Bing Crosby. The event was held again until 1967 when it was run at a distance of one mile. In 1973, the race was brought back permanently as a contest for horses aged three and older at a distance of miles on the turf. During the next few years there would be more distance changes. It was run at miles in 1973, 1 mile in 1974–1975, and seven and one-half furlongs from 1976–1980, after which it was set at its current distance of miles. In 1981 the event was moved to the dirt and the events conditions changed to the current restriction of fillies and mares that are three-years-old and older. Since then it has been run on the dirt except from 2007 to 2014 when Del Mar used a synthetic \\"all weather\\" surface. In 2000 it was renamed to honor Clement L. Hirsch (1914–2000), a Thoroughbred owner whose horse, Magical Maiden won this race in 1993. A Newport Beach, California businessman, Hirsch was responsible for the creation of the Oak Tree Racing Association. The race was run in two divisions in 1977 and again in 1980. The event was classified as Grade III in 1983, upgraded to Grade II in 1986 and a Grade I event in 2009. At the same time, conditions for the event changed from a handicap to a stakes format. In the 1980s when this event became a fillies and mares race it started to attract high calibre performers that would confirm the status of the event. Starting in 1984 with the winner Princess Rooney who later that year would win the Breeders' Cup Distaff and be crowned US Champion Older Dirt Female Horse. The 1990 winner, the Argentine bred mare Bayakoa would rectify her unplaced finish from 1989 and would also win the Breeders' Cup Distaff for the second time and retain her position as US Champion Older Dirt Female Horse. Allen E. Paulson's two-time winner of the event, Azeri would become US Horse of the Year in 2002. Zenyatta proved her dominance in this event winning it three times and with that she continued on winning the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic and in 2010 becoming US Horse of the Year.

The event currently carries a purse of $150,000. History The event was inaugurated on 2 September 1987 with additional sponsorship from Budweiser and the Breeders' Cup at a distance of as a one mile race on the dirt track and was won by the 9-1 shot Good Command who was ridden by United States' Racing Hall of Fame jockey Chris McCarron in a time of 1:35. The following year the event was by Precisionist, the 1985 U.S. Champion Sprint Horse who had come out of retirement after an unsuccessful stud career. For the third running the event had been classified as Grade III and the next year in 1990 a Grade II, the current classification. Budweiser continued sponsorship until 1995 and the Breeders' Cup until 2006. After sponsorship ceased the event was renamed by the Del Mar administration to Del Mar Mile Handicap. In 2005 the event was moved from the dirt track to the turf.

It is the northernmost settlement in the Upernavik Archipelago, located on Kullorsuaq Island at the southern end of Melville Bay, itself part of the larger Baffin Bay. The settlement was founded in 1928 and became a trading station, growing in size after World War II when hunters from several small villages around Inussulik Bay, Sugar Loaf Bay, and Tasiusaq Bay moved into the larger settlements such as Nuussuaq and Kullorsuaq. Today, Kullorsuaq remains one of the most traditional hunting and fishing villages in Greenland, but maintains a stable population. The name of the settlement means \\"Big Thumb\\" in Kalaallisut, after the Devil's Thumb, a prominent pinnacle-shaped mountain in the center of the island about north of the settlement.  Geography  Kullorsuaq is located on an island of the same name at the southern end of Melville Bay. The island is the northernmost part of Upernavik Archipelago.Upernavik Avannarleq, Saga Map, 1:250.000, Tage Schjøtt, 1992  History = Prehistory  Kullorsuaq Inuunerup Nutaap Oqaluffia, the Greenland Free Church in Kullorsuaq The Upernavik Archipelago was among the earliest-settled areas of Greenland, the first migrants arriving approximately 4,000 years ago. All southbound migrations of the Inuit passed through the area, leaving behind a trail of archeological sites. These first settlers belong to the Saqqaq culture but were followed around 3,000 years ago by the Dorset culture, which spread along the coast of Baffin Bay. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the Dorset were themselves displaced by the Thule people. The archipelago has been continuously but sparsely inhabited over this period. Migrants in the 19th and early 20th centuries found many ruins of Inuit settlement on Kullorsuaq, Kiatassuaq, and other smaller islands around Melville Bay, although Danish settlers during the colonial era were unaware of Kullorsuaq until the end of 19th century.  20th century  The modern settlement was initially populated by hunters from now-abandoned villages to Kiatassuaq's south: Inussulik Bay, Sugar Loaf Bay, and Tasiusaq Bay. The initial wave of settlers originated in villages of fewer than 10 people: Ikermiut (abandoned 1954), Itissaalik (abandoned 1957), and Kuuk (abandoned 1972). Several families of hunters from Nuussuaq also moved north to Kullorsuaq, which was founded in 1928. Between 1930 and 1960, northwestern Greenland underwent a consolidation phase, largely driven by the Danish colonial authorities via Royal Greenland, then part of KNI, which possessed an island-wide monopoly on trade. The mutual agreement between the hunting families and the trade company limited the pre-war northward expansion until the 1950s, when the populations of the smaller settlements reinforced larger communities in Nuussuaq and Kullorsuaq. In 1952, Kullorsuaq became the northernmost trading post in the archipelago with the establishment of its first year-round shop. In the 1960s, Kullorsuaq was a staging point for further expansion into Savissivik to the northwest, although this was unsuccessful and most migrants returned south in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the settlement remains one of the most traditional hunting and fishing villages in Greenland. The French film “Le voyage au Groenland” Sébastien Betbeder, 2016 takes place in Kullorsuaq.  Economy  Kullorsuaq Harbour Fishing including narwhals and whales and hunting including fur seals and walruses are the primary occupations in the area. The fish processing plant for Upernavik Seafood (a subsidiary of Royal Greenland) and the Pilersuisoq general store are the only organized employers in the settlement. Kullorsuaq is among the 10 poorest communities in Greenland, as are three other settlements in the archipelago Naajaat, Nuussuaq, and Upernavik Kujalleq.  Transport  Kullorsuaq Heliport Air Greenland serves the village as part of a government contract, with twice-weekly helicopter flights to Nuussuaq and Upernavik.  Population  With 453 inhabitants (2020), Kullorsuaq is the largest settlement in the Upernavik Archipelago outside of Upernavik. It is one of the few settlements in the Avannaata municipality exhibiting significant growth patterns over the course of the last two decades, increasing by over 63% relative to its 1990 level and by almost 16% relative to its 2000 level.

Training Trained at the Artisans School of Design, Trades Hall, Melbourne and later the National Gallery School, Melbourne and the London Royal Academy Schools, Richardson worked in various media and also exhibited many oils and watercolours. When in London he shared studios for a time with fellow students from Melbourne, Tom Roberts and Bertram Mackennal. Richardson was regarded as one of the most important artists of his generation in Melbourne during the late 1880s and the 1890s. He was discussed by critics as the equal of such artists as Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton and Frederick McCubbin. Richardson's works were read as synonymous with the new nationalist school of plein air painters. At c. 1890, Richardson was a close associate of these artists, both personally and professionally. He showed both sculpted and painted \\"impressions\\" at the famed 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition, Melbourne August 1889, regarded as one of Australia's first modernist group shows with a manifesto. In c. 1880 he was a ringleader alongside Tom Roberts of student protests at the National Gallery school. Presidency of Victorian Artists' Society During the first world war he was elected as president of the Victorian Artists Society following dissatisfaction with Max Meldrum and his very vocal core of supporters. Although he was one of the longest serving presidents, Richardson is little remembered by that group. Richardson's reputation has diminished amongst subsequent curators, critics and historians, partly because relatively few of the significant and highly regarded works that he was known to have produced came on the market, partly because his interest in symbolism and the British New Sculpture movement did not speak to the social realist values that were read into the plein air group by many later commentators. He is now read as a curious adjunct to the plein air school of painters known as the Heidelberg School rather than as the core figure that he once was. Marriage Relatively late in life in 1914 he married the sculptor Margaret Baskerville, who was one of the most high-profiled and proactively professional Australian women artists prior to Margaret Preston. Baskerville received many commissions but her work lacked the lyrical and poetic qualities of the best of Richardson's works A recent bronze casting of his female figure, The Cloud, was set into a formal water garden beside the former Brighton Town Hall (Victoria, Australia) in the 1980s.

The event currently carries a purse of $125,000. History The event is named for the city of La Jolla, California, which is not far from Del Mar. The event was inaugurated on 11 July 1937 as an event for three-year-olds and older and was won by the five-year-old mare Topsy Omar by the shortest of margins defeating the favorite Grey Count in a time of 1:45. The event was not run in 1939 but moved to early February 1940 to Santa Anita as a seven furlong event for four-year-olds and older on the turf. The champion Seabiscuit resumed in this event after a long layoff carrying 128 pounds after injury and was placed third to Heelfly. Later in the year the event was run at Del Mar at the set distance of one mile. The event was idle during 1942-1944 due to World War II, resuming in 1945 as a three-year-olds and older California bred handicap. In 1950 the event's conditions were set for three-year-olds at the distance. In 1973 the event was classified as Grade III and in 1975 was moved to the turf track and has been run since then on that surface. In 1987 the event's distance was extended from one mile to miles. From 2004 to 2013 the event was run as a Grade II. The event's position in the racing calendar at Del Mar has lead to the race being a preparatory race for the Del Mar Derby which is scheduled usually several weeks later. The event has been split into division four times, the last being in 1982. Two fillies or mares have won this event. The inaugural running in 1937 and Henpecker in 1948 when the event was restricted to three-year-old fillies.

The event currently carries a purse of $200,000. History The race was named in honor of actor and Del Mar Racetrack co-founder, Pat O'Brien (1899–1983). Pat O'Brien, a classic character movie actor who often appeared in a James Cagney starring vehicle, loved the races. The inaugural running of the event was on 25 September 1980, the twelfth and final day of the Del Mar Fair meeting. The event was for two year olds, over a distance of furlongs on the turf track and was won by Elmendorf Farm's Seafood in a time of 1:30. The following year the L.A. County Fair was moved to Pomona Fairgrounds and the event was idle. In 1986 the administration of Del Mar renewed the event during their summer meeting as a sprint handicap over seven furlongs on the dirt. Between 1990-1995 and 2004-2006 the race had Breeders' Cup incentives which were reflected in the name of the event. The event was classified a Grade III event in 1994 and upgraded to Grade II in 1999. In 2009 the event became a Grade I and after three runnings it was downgraded back to a Grade II stakes. Of the notable winners of the event are Lit de Justice who won in 1995 in stakes record time, the following year he won the Breeders' Cup Sprint. The 1996 winner Alphabet Soup used the sprint event in his campaign which led to a victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic. The 2014 winner Goldencents went on to win his second Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile.

The event currently carries a purse of $200,000. History The event was inaugurated on 17 August 1949 as the San Clemente Handicap as a fillies & mares, three-year-olds and older handicap and was won by the six year old mare Good Breeze who defeated the favourite Honeymoon who was giving 31 pounds to the winner in a time of 1:37.20 for the mile. The following year the event was named the San Clemente Claiming Handicap and was open to all horses three-year-olds and older with an increase in distance to miles and the event was won by the four year old gelding Vino Fino who took the lead 70 years from the finishing line and won by a length and three quarters. The event then was idle until 1970 when it was renewed as the San Clemente Stakes on the turf track for three year old fillies only. The distance was decreased to one mile in 1988 and has been held the same to date. In 1994 the event was classified as Grade III and was upgraded to Grade II in 1996. The event has been split into divisions five times with last time occurring in 1990. The event was run with handicap conditions between 1988 and 2017. The event is considered a major preparatory race for the Grade I Del Mar Oaks which is run later in the Del Mar summer meeting.

The depths to which submarines can dive are limited by the strengths of their hulls.  Ratings  Human occupants of a submarine would suffer physiological problems if the air pressure inside were simply allowed to be equal to the water pressure outside the hull (for example, oxygen becomes toxic at high pressures). So, when the inside air is kept at normal atmospheric pressure, the hull must be able to withstand the forces created by the outside water pressure being greater than the inside air pressure. The outside water pressure increases with depth and so the stresses on the hull also increase with depth. Each 10 metres (33 feet) of depth puts another atmosphere (1 bar, 14.7 psi, 101 kPa) of pressure on the hull, so at 300 metres (1,000 feet), the hull is withstanding thirty atmospheres (30 bar, 441 psi, 3,000 kPa) of water pressure. Design depth Design depth is the nominal depth listed in the submarine's specifications. From it the designers calculate the thickness of the hull metal, the boat's displacement, and many other related factors. Since the designers incorporate margins of error in their calculations, crush depth of an actual vessel should be slightly deeper than its design depth. Test depth Test depth is the maximum depth at which a submarine is permitted to operate under normal peacetime circumstances, and is tested during sea trials. The test depth is set at two- thirds of the design depth for United States Navy submarines, while the Royal Navy sets test depth at 4/7 the design depth, and the German Navy sets it at exactly one-half of design depth. Operating depth The maximum operating depth (popularly called the never-exceed depth) is the maximum depth at which a submarine is allowed to operate under any (e.g. battle) conditions. Crush depth Crush depth, officially called collapse depth, is the submerged depth at which a submarine's hull is expected to collapse due to pressure. This is normally calculated. However, it is not always accurate. Submarines from many nations in World War II survived being forced through crush depth, due to flooding or mechanical failure, only to have the water pumped out, or the failure repaired, and succeed in surfacing again. These reports are not necessarily verifiable, and popular misunderstanding of the difference between test depth and collapse depth can confuse the discussion. World War II German U-boats generally had collapse depths in the range of 200 to 280 metres (660 to 920 feet).

They were both born in England – Eric Cobham from Poole and Maria Lindsey from Plymouth. History According to Philip Gosse in The Pirate's Who's Who (1924) and Horwood & Butts in The Pirates and Outlaws of Canada (1984), the Cobhams were among the first St. Lawrence pirates to become known for giving “no quarter,” meaning all the captured crews were killed and the ships sunk. They were famous for their sadism and cruelty, including using survivors for target practice. They were pirates between 1720s-40s after which they relocated to Le Havre, France. They became members of the community and Eric was appointed a judge. Maria couldn't make the adjustment and went insane, finally committing suicide (or possibly being murdered by Eric). Eric had an attack of conscience after her death, confessed his sins to a priest, and requested the true story of his life be published. This book was printed after his death, the family tried to buy and destroy this book, however there's allegedly a copy in the Archives Nationales, Paris. They were survived by 2 sons and a daughter. Hoax? Other than second hand mention, there is little proof on the ground that Cobham and his wife actually existed. It is extraordinarily unlikely that they could have had the career described in the mid-18th century without leaving a single documentary trace. However, in a book, Buccaneers and Marooners of America, published in 1891; editor Howard Pyle mentions Cobham in passing as if his exploits were already well known to the public at large and details Cobham's attack on a Spanish ship in the Bay of Biscay wherein all persons of Spanish origin (approximately 20) aboard the seized vessel were sewn into the mainsail and thrown into the sea.

It runs from Brandscheid near Prüm in a northeasterly direction to Ormont. The name Schneifel has nothing to do with the German words Schnee (snow) and Eifel. It is derived from the former dialect of this region and means something like Schneise (\\"swathe\\"). This swathe ran over the mountains. The term was \\"Germanised\\" during the Prussian era and the term Schnee-Eifel (\\"Snow Eifel\\") was born, albeit referring to a larger area. Winters in this low mountainous region are unusually cold and snowy for western and parts of central Europe and snow lies here for longer than anywhere else in the Eifel. As a result, the winter sports season is longer here than in the surrounding region. The highest point of the Schneifel is the 699.1-metre-high Schwarze Mann (\\"Black Man\\"), which is also the third highest point of the Eifel range after the Hohe Acht and the Erresberg (Ernstberg). There is a winter sports area on the Schwarze Mann with the same name. The Schneifel is covered along its entire length by the ruins of bunkers which formed part of the Siegfried Line. On the heights of the Schneifel is the former US radar station, Prüm Air Station, and the Schnee Eifel transmission tower for terrestrial TV and VHF which, with a height of 224 m is clearly visible for miles.

A fireball was observed travelling from the northwest to the southeast, and a single stone weighing about was recovered from a small impact pit. Composition It contains a uniquely wide variety of minerals, causing debate about its origin. It is largely carbonaceous chondrite material of type CR2, but also contains fragments of other types, such as C1, CM1, and C3. Of the nearly 60 minerals found in the meteorite, several have not been found elsewhere in nature, such as florenskyite, which has the chemical formula FeTiP. Origin In March 2004 it was suggested that the meteorite originated from the Martian moon Phobos. The reason Phobos has been suggested is the existence of two extremely rare alkaline-rich clasts visible in the meteorite, each of which entered the rock at different times. This suggests that the parent body would have been near a source of an alkaline-rich rock, which is almost wholly produced by deep differentiation. This points to Mars and one of its moons, and Phobos is more likely than Deimos because it is closer to Mars. However, mineralogical and noble gas work do not tie the lithic fragments to Mars, as they have other proven Martian meteorites, and this hypothesized link is tenuous at best. In support of the Phobos hypothesis, in 2017 two scientists at the Western University found that meteorites originating from Phobos (and even Deimos) can travel to Earth.

The Vienna summit was a summit meeting held on June 4, 1961, in Vienna, Austria, between President John F. Kennedy of the United States and Premier Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. The leaders of the two superpowers of the Cold War era discussed numerous issues in the relationship between their countries. The summit took place only days after the assassination of President of the Dominican Republic Rafael Trujillo. Context=Khrushchev and Kennedy prior to the summit Kennedy and Khrushchev first met at the Vienna Summit in June 1961. Prior to meeting face to face, their contact began when Khrushchev sent Kennedy a message on November 9, 1960, congratulating him on his presidential election victory and stating his hope that \\"relations between [the U.S. and USSR] would again follow the line along which they were developing in Franklin Roosevelt's time.\\"U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States: Communications between Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1961 (Washington, DC: U.S. Office of the Historian, 2014), Document 1. http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v06/d1 He also told Kennedy that the USSR desired to negotiate with the U.S. on issues relating to \\"disarmament ... a German peace treaty ... and other questions which could bring about an easing and improvement of the entire international situation.\\" In a reply message, Kennedy thanked Khrushchev and similar niceties continued until 1961. On February 22, 1961, Kennedy sent Khrushchev a letter stating, \\"I hope it will be possible, before too long, for us to meet personally for an informal exchange of views.\\"U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States: Communications between Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1961 (Washington, DC: U.S. Office of the Historian, 2014), Document 7. http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v06/d7 This was the first time either man suggested a diplomatic meeting. Kennedy felt \\"that if he could just sit down with Khrushchev\\" the two leaders could work out their interstate conflicts.William Taubman, Khrushchev: The Man and His Era (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc, 2003), 488. Yet, Kennedy's advisers told him not to meet with Khrushchev so soon after the presidential election. The American ambassador to Moscow, Llewellyn E. Thompson, feared that Kennedy misjudged Khrushchev's personality and intentions. Likewise, U.S. diplomat Charles Bohlen \\"worried that JFK underrated Khrushchev's determination to expand world communism.\\" Nevertheless, Khrushchev accepted Kennedy's summit proposal, and the leaders began to make plans for their official meeting. Meanwhile, Cold War rivalries between the two powers escalated in Germany, Laos, and Cuba. These regional conflicts became major items on the Vienna Summit agenda. The Berlin question Between 1945 and 1961, 2.7 million East Germans emigrated from East Berlin, a part of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), to West Berlin. GDR leader Walter Ulbricht argued that the large number of emigrants leaving East Berlin threatened the existence of the GDR by diminishing its population.Hope M. Harrison, Cold War History, Vol. 1, No. 1, Driving the Soviet up the Wall: A Super-Ally, A Superpower, and the Building of the Berlin Wall, 1958-61. (London: Frank Cass, 2000). In the early months of 1961, Ulbricht pressured Khrushchev to close the border between East and West Berlin. Khrushchev understood Ulbricht's concern but feared that a potential intervention from Western powers would destabilize East Berlin further. Thompson warned in February 1961 that if there were \\"no progress\\" on Berlin and Germany, Khrushchev would \\"almost certainly proceed with [his] separate peace treaty....\\"Taubman, Khrushchev: The Man and His Era, 489. The notion of a separate peace treaty threatened American interests in West Germany; if the USSR rendered complete control of East Berlin to the East German government, then the U.S. could only communicate with and control West Berlin with permission from the East German government. The Berlin Question—whether or not the U.S. would allow the USSR to sign a separate peace treaty with Berlin—dominated Khrushchev and Kennedy's debates at the Vienna Summit. The signing of a separate peace treaty with Berlin did not appeal to American policymakers, who felt comfortable with the division of Germany and Berlin itself. A peace treaty threatened the established balance of power and could potentially lead to the United States losing all its influence in East Berlin. The Laos question A lesser-known conflict fueled controversy at the Vienna Summit as well. \\"As in Berlin, [Kennedy] inherited in Laos a situation aggravated by near-direct armed confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States.\\"Usha Mahajani, \\"President Kennedy and United States Policy in Laos, 1961-1963,\\" Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 2, no. 2 (1971): 87. During Eisenhower's presidency, the U.S. backed a right-wing conservative government (royal government) in Laos to counter that communist threat of the popular Pathet Lao.Edmund F. Wehrle, \\"'A Good, Bad Deal': John F. Kennedy, W. Averell Harriman, and the Neutralization of Laos.'\\" Pacific Historical Review 67, no. 3 (1998): 352. In Laos, \\"the Eisenhower government committed millions of dollars in aid\\" in order to continue the rule of a pro- American leader.John F. Kennedy: Presidential Library and Museum, Laos, http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Laos.aspx. Both the Soviets and the Americans knew that a proxy war in Laos drove both countries further into an arms race. Under this context, Khrushchev and Kennedy discussed the Laos situation at length at the Vienna Summit. The Bay of Pigs Invasion The American-facilitated Bay of Pigs Invasion of April 1961 also rocked Khrushchev and Kennedy's relationship. On April 18, 1961, Khrushchev sent Kennedy a telegram that said, \\"Mr. President, I send you this message in an hour of alarm, fraught with danger for the peace of the whole world. Armed aggression has begun against Cuba.\\"U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States: Communications between Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1961 (Washington, DC: U.S. Office of the Historian, 2014), Document 9. http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v06/d9n Kennedy countered by saying that the Americans were merely helping support the \\"100,000 Cubans\\" attempting to \\"[resist] the Castro dictatorship.\\"U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States: Communications between Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1961 (Washington, DC: U.S. Office of the Historian, 2014), Document 10. http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v06/d10 He claimed that the Americans fought on the side of freedom and Cuban self-determination. Kennedy knew that the Cuban invasion sparked controversy. Therefore, Kennedy felt it crucial to meet with Khrushchev as soon as possible. He hoped that open channels of communication could remedy some of the conflict between the U.S. and the USSR. Khrushchev and Kennedy met in Vienna on June 4, 1961. Discussions John F. Kennedy meeting Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev and Kennedy devoted a significant amount of time at the Vienna Summit to discussing the Berlin Crisis. Khrushchev opened the conversation by expressing the Soviet perspective that a united Germany \\"[constituted] a threat of World War III.\\"U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States: Communications between Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1961 (Washington, DC: U.S. Office of the Historian, 2014), Document 32. http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v06/d32 He pointed to the fact that Germany began World War II. Only 15 years after the end of that war, Germany again posed a \\"military threat\\" as a member of NATO. Khrushchev explained that the USSR desired to sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. Such a treaty, he argued, \\"would not prejudice the interests of the U.S., the UK, or France.\\" He told Kennedy that if the United States failed to support a peace treaty, the Soviet Union would sign the peace treaty unilaterally. Kennedy replied that American forces occupied Berlin \\"by contractual rights\\" rather than by the agreement of East Germans. Kennedy understood the Soviet perspective but feared that if the U.S. removed its troops from Berlin, \\"no one would have any confidence in U.S. commitments and pledges.\\" Kennedy insisted that the U.S. maintain its position in Berlin for strategic purposes. Although Kennedy argued that the current balance of power in Germany was effective, Khrushchev said that \\"no force in the world would prevent the USSR from signing a peace treaty.\\" When Kennedy pointed out that such a treaty required unilateral action on the part of the Soviet Union, thereby ignoring the four-power agreement signed at the end of World War II, Khrushchev stated that such a peace treaty nullified the four-power agreement. He insisted that the city of Berlin should belong solely to the German Democratic Republic. West Germany, Khrushchev told Kennedy, would remain under American influence. Kennedy countered by saying that the U.S. could not accept such an agreement owing to the prestige it would lose as a result of the decision. In light of this remark, Khrushchev suggested that an \\"interim arrangement\\" be considered. Khrushchev remained firm in the fact that \\"the Soviet Union [would] sign [the peace treaty] in December if the U.S. [refused] an interim agreement.\\" Kennedy hoped to determine the Soviets' feeling regarding the neutralization of Laos.Wehrle, \\"A Good, Bad Deal\\", 359. Kennedy wanted to convince Khrushchev that the United States and Soviet Union could work together to de-escalate tensions in the unstable state. \\"Without a firm Soviet commitment to stop supplying the guerrillas and to persuade the North Vietnamese to halt their efforts, nothing could be accomplished,\\" Kennedy asserted. On the first day of the Summit, Kennedy quickly discovered that Khrushchev was in no mood to discuss the Laos situation. Khrushchev only rebuffed the United States for playing a significant role in the overthrowing of the Laos government. The next day, Kennedy approached the Laos subject again. This time, Khrushchev negotiated more willingly. Khrushchev agreed that a \\"neutral and independent Laos chosen by the Laotians themselves\\" benefited both the U.S. and the USSR.Mahajani, \\"President Kennedy and United States Policy in Laos,\\" 95. Although the leaders made no official agreement, they did reach a consensus regarding the future of Laos—cease-fire and ultimate neutralization. This agreement proved to be one of the only accomplishments of the Vienna Summit.Wehrle, \\"A Good, Bad Deal,\\" 360. Outcomes Seymour Topping's article on \\"Khrushchev and Vienna\\" ran in the New York Times on June 3—the day before the conference began. Topping correctly identified the major points of conversation that dominated the conference—the Berlin and Laos questions.Seymour Topping, \\"Khrushchev and Vienna,\\" New York Times, June 3rd, 1961, p. 7. http://search.proquest.com/docview/115477559/ Topping also correctly stated Khrushchev's opinions regarding each issue and pinpointed the Soviet perspective on Berlin. Clearly, both the Americans and the Soviets had ample information regarding the other's position prior to the opening of the Summit. However, no one could predict the outcome of the summit, including the leaders' reactions to each other. For the Americans, the summit was initially seen as a diplomatic triumph. Kennedy had refused to allow Soviet pressure to force his hand, or to influence the American policy of containment. He had adequately stalled Khrushchev and made it clear that the United States was not willing to compromise on a withdrawal from Berlin, whatever pressure Khrushchev may exert on the \\"testicles of the West,\\" as Khrushchev once called them. In retrospect the summit may be seen as a failure. The two leaders became increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress of the negotiations. Kennedy later said of Khrushchev, \\"He beat the hell out of me\\" and told New York Times reporter James 'Scotty' Reston it was the \\"worst thing in my life. He savaged me.\\" On the other hand, Khrushchev viewed the Summit in a much more positive light. In his memoir, Khrushchev showed ambivalence. He proclaimed, \\"I was generally pleased with our meeting in Vienna. Even though we came to no concrete agreement, I could tell that [Kennedy] was interested in finding a peaceful solution to world problems and avoiding conflict with the Soviet Union.\\"Nikita S. Khrushchev, Khrushchev Remembers (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1970), 458 However, historian William Taubman suggests that Khrushchev merely felt he could \\"[push Kennedy around].\\"William Taubman, Khrushchev: The Man and His Era (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, Inc, 2003), 495. In addition to conveying U.S. reluctance to defend the full rights of Berlin's citizens, Kennedy ignored his own cabinet officials' advice to avoid ideological debate with Khrushchev. Khrushchev outmatched Kennedy in this debate and came away believing he had triumphed in the summit over a weak and inexperienced leader. Observing Kennedy's morose expression at the end of the summit, Khrushchev believed Kennedy \\"looked not only anxious, but deeply upset.... I hadn't meant to upset him. I would have liked very much for us to part in a different mood. But there was nothing I could do to help him.... Politics is a merciless business.\\" After the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, then President Kennedy believed that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to \\"draw a line in the sand\\" and prevent a communist victory in the Vietnam War. He told James Reston of The New York Times immediately after his Vienna meeting with Khrushchev, \\"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\\"[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F.

It is subdivided into five residential districts, each covering 10,000 hectares. The town's economy is dominated by the nuclear, automobile, and construction industries. The Ural Electro Chemical Plant's main activities are uranium enrichment and the development of centrifuge technology, as well as the manufacture of instruments and industrial systems for the nuclear industry. The plant began operating in 1949 and was the site of the Soviet Union's first gaseous diffusion enrichment plant. In 1950, certain technical difficulties were resolved and UECP began producing tens of kilograms of 90 percent enriched uranium. The original plant, called D-1, was extended to include plant D-3 in 1951, and plants D-4 and D-5 in 1953. Officials from the Ministry of Atomic Industry once said that Sverdlovsk-44 was the only plant ever used to produce weapons-grade highly enriched uranium. The plant lead the development of Russian centrifuge technology, has used seventh-generation gas centrifuges since 1996 and has developed eighth-generation centrifuges. UECP now produces LEU using centrifuge technology. It is one of four Russian enrichment facilities. Another major industrial enterprise was the Urals Auto Motor Plant, founded in 1967. It was the subsidiary of the Likhachyov Moscow's Auto Motor Plant. However, the Urals Auto Motor Plant declared bankruptcy in 2000 and was later acquired by Automobiles and Motors of the Urals, a joint Russian-Chinese car manufacturing venture. Education and culture Novouralsk's educational facilities include Novouralsks Engineering Physical Institute, Polytechnic College, Medical College, Pedagogical College. There are also twenty-two schools and twenty-seven kindergartens. Modern-day Novouralsk has two Cultural Centers, three libraries, which are considered the best in the region, a children's arts school and a children's musical school, two cinemas, a museum, a puppet theater, and an amusement park. The Central Town Library has become a focus for cultural activities and holds over 800 events annually. The library is fully computerized, and offers free Internet access, and Novouralsk citizens consider their library to be one of the best in Russia. Another library in the town caters solely for children and young people. Cultural life has evolved as the town has grown. The first social club opened in 1947, home to a brass band and various clubs, including drama, followed by cinema and a library in 1949. A musical school opened in 1950 and the Operetta Theater in 1951. The Theater can seat up to 600 people, and the company has traveled to dozens of Russian cities, and to practically every town in the Urals. The Puppet Theater Skazka was founded in 1957. The Historical and Area-Study Museum has over 8,000 exhibits. Sports The Municipal Concert-Sports Complex was opened in 1998, a modern facility with an artificial ice rink and a hockey pitch. It can be used as an ice stadium or sports or a concert ground with seating for 1,270 people. The Yava Trophy yacht championship is held in Novouralsk every four years.

The following year the event was decreased to the current distance of one mile. The Fort Harrod Stakes was named after the fort which was named after James Harrod, who led an early party of settlers into Kentucky in the 1770s. In 1997 the Maker's Mark distillery located not far from Lexington, began their sponsorship of the event and Keeneland's administration renamed the event to the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes. In 2010 the event was once again renamed to a bourbon distilled by Maker's Mark – Maker's 46 Mile Stakes. The event was classified a Grade III in 1991 and was upgraded to Grade II race in 2000. In 2008 the event reached as a Grade I status confirming the quality that had competed in previous years and continues to attract. Several class horses who have won this event in the spring have continued to prove their dominance. The 1991 winner, Opening Verse continued on to win the Breeders' Cup Mile that year.

In most cases, a mare is a female horse over the age of three, and a filly is a female horse three and younger. In Thoroughbred horse racing, a mare is defined as a female horse more than four years old. The word can also be used for other female equine animals, particularly mules and zebras, but a female donkey is usually called a \\"jenny\\". A broodmare is a mare used for breeding. A horse's female parent is known as its dam. An uncastrated adult male horse is called a stallion and a castrated male is a gelding. Occasionally, the term \\"horse\\" is used to designate only a male horse. Reproductive cycle A nursing foal. Domesticated mares may nurse their foals an average of four to six months, occasionally longer, depending on human management decisions and the temperament of a given mare. Reproductive organs of the mare. (superior view) Mares carry their young (called foals) for approximately 11 months from conception to birth. (Average range 320–370 days.)Ensminger, M. E. Horses and Horsemanship: Animal Agriculture Series. Sixth Edition. Interstate Publishers, 1990. p. 156 Usually just one young is born; twins are rare. When a domesticated mare foals, she nurses the foal for at least four to six months before it is weaned, though mares in the wild may allow a foal to nurse for up to a year. The estrous cycle, also known as \\"season\\" or \\"heat\\" of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. As the days shorten, most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. The reproductive cycle in a mare is controlled by the photoperiod (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. As the days shorten, the mare returns to the anestrus period when she is not sexually receptive. Anestrus prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her foaling during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.Ensminger, M. E. Horses and Horsemanship: Animal Agriculture Series. Sixth Edition. Interstate Publishers, 1990. p. 150 However, for most competitive purposes, foals are given an official \\"birthday\\" of January 1 (August 1 in the Southern hemisphere), and many breeders want foals to be born as early in the year as possible. Therefore, many breeding farms begin to put mares \\"under lights\\" in late winter in order to bring them out of anestrus early and allow conception to occur in February or March. One exception to this general rule is the field of endurance riding, which requires horses to be 60 true calendar months old (5 years) before competing at longer distances. Fillies are sexually mature by age two and are sometimes bred at that age, but generally should not be bred until they have stopped growing, usually by age four or five.Ensminger, M. E. Horses and Horsemanship: Animal Agriculture Series. Sixth Edition. Interstate Publishers, 1990. p. 149-150 A healthy, well-managed mare can produce a foal every year into her twenties, though not all breeders will breed a mare every year. In addition, many mares are kept for riding and so are not bred annually, as a mare in late pregnancy or nursing a foal is not able to perform at as athletic a standard as one who is neither pregnant nor lactating. In addition, some mares become anxious when separated from their foals, even temporarily, and thus are difficult to manage under saddle until their foals are weaned. Illustration of a cross-section of a pregnant mare Behavior A broodmare. Note slight distension of belly, indicating either early pregnancy or recent foaling. Mares are considered easier to handle than stallions. However, geldings have little to no hormone-driven behavior patterns at all, thus sometimes they are preferred to both mares and stallions. Mares have a notorious, if generally undeserved, reputation for being \\"marish\\", meaning that they can be cranky or unwilling when they come into season. While a few mares may be somewhat more distractible or irritable when in heat, they are far less easily distracted than a stallion at any time. Solid training usually minimizes hormonal behavior. For competitive purposes, mares are sometimes placed on hormone therapies, such as the drug Regumate, to help control hormonally based behavior. Some riders also use various herbal remedies, most of which have not been extensively tested for effectiveness. In relation to maternal behaviour, the formation of the bond between a mare and her foal \\"occurs during the first few hours post-partum, but that of the foal to the mare takes place over a period of days\\". Mares and geldings can be pastured together. However, mares may be a bit more territorial than geldings, even though they are far less territorial than stallions. Sex-segregating herds may make for less infighting, especially if kept in close quarters. However, studies also have shown that when a \\"lead mare\\" or \\"boss mare\\" is in charge of a herd, all remaining animals rest for longer periods and seem more at ease than do those in herds led by a gelding. In wild herds, a \\"boss mare\\" or \\"lead mare\\" leads the band to grazing, to water, and away from danger. She eats and drinks first, decides when the herd will move and to where. The herd stallion usually brings up the rear and acts as a defender of the herd against predators and other stallions. Uses Mares can be used in any equestrian sport and have competed successfully against males. Zenyatta, winner of the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic, racing in the Lady's Secret Stakes. Mares are used in every equestrian sport and usually compete equally with stallions and geldings in most events, though some competitions may offer classes open only to one sex of horse or another, particularly in breeding or \\"in-hand\\" conformation classes. In horse racing, mares and fillies have their own races and only a small percentage compete against male horses. However, a few fillies and mares have won classic horse races against colts, including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, the Belmont Stakes, the Melbourne Cup and the Breeders' Cup Classic. Mares are used as dairy animals in some cultures, especially by the nomads and formerly nomadic peoples of Central Asia. Fermented mare's milk, known as kumis, is the national drink of Kyrgyzstan. Some mares, usually of draft horse breeding, are kept in North America for the production of their urine. Pregnant mares' urine is the source of the active ingredient in the hormonal drug Premarin (derived from Pregnant mares' urine). Historic use Until the invention of castration, and even later where there was less cultural acceptance of castration, mares were less difficult to manage than stallions and thus preferred for most ordinary work. Historically, the Bedouin nomads of the Arabian peninsula preferred mares on their raids, because stallions would nicker to the opposing camps' horses, whereas mares would be quiet. However, other cultures preferred male horses over mares either due to a desire for more aggressive behavior in a fighting animal, or to not be inconvenienced with a loss of work ability due to a mare's pregnancy, parturition and lactation. Etymology The word mare, meaning \\"female horse\\", took several forms before A.D. 900. Multiple definitions of Mare and its etymological origins. Web site accessed September 30, 2009 In Old English the form was mīere, mere or mȳre, the feminine forms for mearh (horse). The Old German form of the word was Mähre. Similarly, in Irish and Gaelic, the word was marc, in Welsh, march, in Cornish \\"margh\\", and in Breton marc'h. The word is \\"said to be of Gaulish origin.\\" It is said by some writers to derive from Proto-Germanic *marhijō (“female horse”), from Proto-Germanic marhaz (\\"horse\\"), from Proto-Indo-European *markos (\\"horse\\"). The word has no known cognates beyond Germanic and Celtic. One possible derived term is a mare's nest, an expression for \\"excitement over something which does not exist\\".Etymology OnLine , accessed November 25, 2007 The term nightmare, is not directly connected etymologically with the word for female horse, but rather to homophones that meant \\"incubus\\" or \\"goblin\\".

Their magazine publishing business was previously known as Database Publications. History Europress was formed by Derek Meakin in 1965. It began by publishing magazines and newspapers, then during the 1980s as an expansion of its magazine publishing business, it became involved in the rapidly growing software industry. Under the name Database Software, they released software including the Red Arrows game for the ZX Spectrum and the office suite Mini Office II, as well as games and educational software for children. During the late 1980s Europress decided to spin off its software publishing division as a separate company: Europress Software, with Christopher Payne as Managing Director and Diane O'Brien as Sales Director. Chris Payne came up with the name Mandarin Software as the brand for all the planned games, graphic designer Heather Sheldrick designed the logo, and Mandarin Software was launched to the press at a Chinese restaurant in London, where it showed off its first round of planned product launched. Europress Software published a high proportion of educational material, such as the Fun School series. The publishing business was purchased by IDG and became IDG Media towards the end of 1994. A reorganisation of the titles promptly followed, with the Atari, Amiga and Acorn divisions each losing one or more titles along the way. Their software publishing business was purchased by Hasbro Interactive in 1999. At first, the studio prospered and expanded. It was able to produce titles using some of the brands owned by Hasbro, even producing two for Hasbro Germany. A little over a year later, Hasbro Interactive was losing money and was sold to Infogrames for a small amount; Infogrames gained ownership of all the Hasbro brands. However, Infogrames were not interested in the educational multimedia, which was Europress's focus, and ignored the company for several months. Ownership was then returned to the Meakin family. They ran the company for little over a year before it went into liquidation. A major factor in this was Granada TV's ignorance of their rights over Countdown. They had encouraged Europress to produce a Countdown CD-ROM, but only weeks before the launch, with large pre-orders, they discovered that they did not have the interactive rights. Derek Meakin sold the rights to the Europress brand name to Atari, who then sold them to Koch Media in 2002. Meakin then cofounded Meakin Enterprises with Chris Phillips. Meakin died in October 2010. Past magazines that have since ceased publication include: Amiga Action, Amiga Computing, Computing with the Amstrad / Amstrad CPC Computing, Atari User, Atari ST User, ST Action, Mega Action, PC Today, PC Home, PC Action, Gamepro UK, Apple User, Telelink and Video Action. Europress Impact When Europress bought Newsfield in 1991, Europress Impact, a satellite company of Europress, was launched. Run by ex-Newsfield directors Roger Kean, Oliver Frey and Jonathan Rignall. In 1993 the publishers name changed to Impact Magazines. Publications ceased in March 1994 as Impact entered into administration. Key titles from Europress / Impact Magazines included: *Zzap!64 - Along with CRASH, Zzap!64 was one of the two main titles brought in from Newsfield. After issue 90 Zzap! was re-launched as Commodore Force, which lasted for 16 more issues ending with the last one on March 1994. *CRASH - CRASH was Newsfield's first ever magazine title and the best seller at its peak. In 1992 the title was sold to EMAP after only five issues and was incorporated into their own Spectrum title Sinclair User. *Sega Force - As with N Force, Sega Force was in its planning stage and ready to go ahead just when Newsfield collapsed. It covered the range of Sega consoles at the time. In July 1993 the magazine was split into Sega Force Mega, for the Mega Drive, and Sega Master Force, for the Master System and Game Gear. The titles disappeared as Impact Magazines closed. *Mega Machines - Impact Magazines launched Mega Machines in the summer of 1993. Similar to the existing Sega Force Mega, the new title catered for the Sega Mega Drive and Sega CD. However, it was aimed at a younger audience and was printed in landscape. *N-Force - Launched in July 1992. Similar to sister title Sega Force but covered the Nintendo consoles NES, SNES and Game Boy. SNES coverage would transfer across to SNES Force, while N-Force maintained NES coverage until it was discontinued in August 1993. *SNES Force - Launched in July 1993. Covering the SNES. *Amiga Force - Amiga Force was launched towards the end of 1992, covering the Commodore Amiga computer games scene. It lasted for 16 issues before going down with its publishers.

Red Banner Town), formerly Lasdehnen (1734-1938; ) and Haselberg (1938-1946), is a town and the administrative center of Krasnoznamensky District in Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the Sheshupe River, northeast of Kaliningrad, the administrative center of the oblast, and approximately to the south of the border with Lithuania. It has a population of Historically known as Lasdehnen, the town belonged to Prussia since 1701 and the German Empire since the unification of Germany in 1871, and was located in the province of East Prussia until 1945. During the Nazi Germany era it was renamed Haselberg until the territory was annexed by the Soviet Union following World War II. The town was renamed Krasnoznamensk and became the administrative center of Krasnoznamensky District in 1947. History The earliest surviving German language record of Krasnoznamensk dates from 1521 under the name Haselpusch, meaning hazel bush in German, while Russian sources give the date of the earliest record as 1576 and other sources state that it was established in 1734. The village had a church by 1578, but it burned down in 1661 and the replacement building had to be taken down in 1869 due to severe structural defects. In the early 18th century the town's name was changed to Lasdehnen, based on the Old Prussian language term for hazel bushes, and the current Gothic Revival church was built between 1874 and 1877. With nationalism still on the rise across most of Europe in the early 20th century, in 1938 the Nazi era government Germanized the town's name, renaming it to Haselberg (literally \\"hazel mountain\\") due to the Baltic origins of Lasdehnen. Church and Šešupė River at Krasnoznamensk (former Lasdehnen) By 1945, during World War II, Haselberg's ethnic German population had largely fled before the advance of the Red Army in 18 January. Following the end of the war Haselberg was included in the portion of East Prussia annexed by the Soviet Union that was organized into Kaliningrad Oblast of the Russian SFSR. The historical regional capital of nearby Schloßberg (still commonly known by its pre-1938 name Pillkallen, now Dobrovolsk) had been severely damaged during the course the war, so Soviet authorities relocated Pillkallen's former administrative functions to Haselberg, which had suffered less damage. On 7 April 1946, the Soviets renamed the town as Krasnoznamensk, literally \\"Red Banner Town\\", and the following year became the administrative center of the new Krasnoznamensky District. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Krasnoznamensk serves as the administrative center of Krasnoznamensky District.Resolution #640 As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Krasnoznamensky District as the town of district significance of Krasnoznamensk. Within the framework of municipal divisions, since May 5, 2015, the territories of the town of district significance of Krasnoznamensk and of three rural okrugs of Krasnoznamensky District are incorporated as Krasnoznamensky Urban Okrug.Law #419 Before that, the town of district significance was incorporated within Krasnoznamensky Municipal District as Krasnoznamenskoye Urban Settlement.

It gains its name from the fact that the Jacobi theta function is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup of the Heisenberg group. The representation was popularized by David Mumford. Construction The theta representation is a representation of the continuous Heisenberg group H_3(\\\\R) over the field of the real numbers. In this representation, the group elements act on a particular Hilbert space. The construction below proceeds first by defining operators that correspond to the Heisenberg group generators. Next, the Hilbert space on which these act is defined, followed by a demonstration of the isomorphism to the usual representations. Group generators Let f(z) be a holomorphic function, let a and b be real numbers, and let \\\\tau be fixed, but arbitrary complex number in the upper half-plane; that is, so that the imaginary part of \\\\tau is positive. Define the operators Sa and Tb such that they act on holomorphic functions as :(S_a f)(z) = f(z+a)= \\\\exp (a \\\\partial_z)f(z) and :(T_b f)(z) = \\\\exp (i\\\\pi b^2 \\\\tau +2\\\\pi ibz) f(z+b\\\\tau)= \\\\exp( i\\\\pi b^2 \\\\tau + 2\\\\pi i bz + b \\\\tau \\\\partial_z) f(z). It can be seen that each operator generates a one- parameter subgroup: :S_{a_1} \\\\left (S_{a_2} f \\\\right ) = \\\\left (S_{a_1} \\\\circ S_{a_2} \\\\right ) f = S_{a_1+a_2} f and :T_{b_1} \\\\left (T_{b_2} f \\\\right ) = \\\\left (T_{b_1} \\\\circ T_{b_2} \\\\right ) f = T_{b_1+b_2} f. However, S and T do not commute: :S_a \\\\circ T_b = \\\\exp (2\\\\pi iab) T_b \\\\circ S_a. Thus we see that S and T together with a unitary phase form a nilpotent Lie group, the (continuous real) Heisenberg group, parametrizable as H=U(1)\\\\times\\\\R\\\\times\\\\R where U(1) is the unitary group. A general group element U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b)\\\\in H then acts on a holomorphic function f(z) as :U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b) f(z)=\\\\lambda (S_a \\\\circ T_b f)(z) = \\\\lambda \\\\exp (i\\\\pi b^2 \\\\tau +2\\\\pi ibz) f(z+a+b\\\\tau) where \\\\lambda \\\\in U(1). U(1) = Z(H) is the center of H, the commutator subgroup [H, H]. The parameter \\\\tau on U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b) serves only to remind that every different value of \\\\tau gives rise to a different representation of the action of the group. Hilbert space The action of the group elements U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b) is unitary and irreducible on a certain Hilbert space of functions. For a fixed value of τ, define a norm on entire functions of the complex plane as :\\\\Vert f \\\\Vert_\\\\tau ^2 = \\\\int_{\\\\C} \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac {-2\\\\pi y^2} {\\\\Im \\\\tau} \\\\right) f(x+iy)^2 \\\\ dx \\\\ dy. Here, \\\\Im \\\\tau is the imaginary part of \\\\tau and the domain of integration is the entire complex plane. Let \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\tau be the set of entire functions f with finite norm. The subscript \\\\tau is used only to indicate that the space depends on the choice of parameter \\\\tau. This \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\tau forms a Hilbert space. The action of U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b) given above is unitary on \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\tau, that is, U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b) preserves the norm on this space. Finally, the action of U_\\\\tau(\\\\lambda,a,b) on \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\tau is irreducible. This norm is closely related to that used to define Segal–Bargmann space. Isomorphism The above theta representation of the Heisenberg group is isomorphic to the canonical Weyl representation of the Heisenberg group. In particular, this implies that \\\\mathcal{H}_\\\\tau and L^2(\\\\R) are isomorphic as H-modules. Let :M(a,b,c) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a & c \\\\ 0 & 1 & b \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} stand for a general group element of H_3(\\\\R). In the canonical Weyl representation, for every real number h, there is a representation \\\\rho_h acting on L^2(\\\\R) as :\\\\rho_h(M(a,b,c)) \\\\psi(x)= \\\\exp (ibx+ihc) \\\\psi(x+ha) for x\\\\in\\\\R and \\\\psi\\\\in L^2(\\\\R). Here, h is Planck's constant. Each such representation is unitarily inequivalent. The corresponding theta representation is: :M(a,0,0) \\\\to S_{ah} :M(0,b,0) \\\\to T_{b/2\\\\pi} :M(0,0,c) \\\\to e^{ihc} Discrete subgroup Define the subgroup \\\\Gamma_\\\\tau\\\\subset H_\\\\tau as :\\\\Gamma_\\\\tau = { U_\\\\tau(1,a,b) \\\\in H_\\\\tau : a,b \\\\in \\\\Z }. The Jacobi theta function is defined as :\\\\vartheta(z; \\\\tau) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp (\\\\pi in^2 \\\\tau + 2 \\\\pi inz). It is an entire function of z that is invariant under \\\\Gamma_\\\\tau. This follows from the properties of the theta function: :\\\\vartheta(z+1; \\\\tau) = \\\\vartheta(z; \\\\tau) and :\\\\vartheta(z+a+b\\\\tau;\\\\tau) = \\\\exp(-\\\\pi i b^2 \\\\tau -2 \\\\pi i b z)\\\\vartheta(z;\\\\tau) when a and b are integers. It can be shown that the Jacobi theta is the unique such function.

The River Doon issues from its northern end, while the loch itself receives waters from Gala Lane and Loch Enoch (in the Galloway Hills) via Eglin Lane. History In the 13th century, it was a site of Balloch Castle, owned by the Earls of Carrick. In the Scottish Wars of Independence it was held by one Gille Brighde, Sir Gilbert de Carrick, a native Carrick nobleman who surrendered it to the English. It was soon recovered by the Scots. In the 15th century, it was frequently in the hands of the Kennedy Clan, although it was briefly in the hands of the Maclellans (backed by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas) after a siege in 1446. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century by King James V as part of a general policy of reducing the power of the barons. In the First World War, there was a growing need to train pilots and aircrew in aerial gunnery. Loch Doon was thought to be ideally suited for such an establishment with its surrounding steep hills being an ideal position for target ranges. Work begin in September 1916 and an airfield, slipways, piers, jetties, seaplane hangars, tramways and other associated buildings erected. The remains of these can still be found on the Loch shore today. The loch was dammed in the 1930s, raising the water some to provide seasonal storage for the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. As a reservoir, Loch Doon has an effective capacity of over 82 million cubic metres. When rainfall is plentiful, water is diverted to the loch from the Water of Deugh via a tunnel system. When water is required for power generation, water is released at Drumjohn to feed Kendoon power reservoir, the first in a series of generating stations and reservoirs on the Water of Ken. During construction work, the ruins of the castle were moved from an island in the Loch to the shore to avoid the rising water. Air crashes Two aircraft are known to have crashed in or near the Loch in the Second World War. On 18 March 1944 F/O Roswell Murray MacTavish of 439 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force was on a training flight from RAF Heathfield in Hawker Hurricane Mk. IV LD564 when it crashed into the forest beside the loch. MacTavish was killed and is buried in Ayr Cemetery. Remains of the aircraft, including its Rolls Royce Merlin engine, are still at the crash site. Loch Doon Spitfire Spitfire Mk IIA P7540, DU-W, at Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum On 25 October 1941 F/O František Hekl of No. 312 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF crashed a Spitfire Mk IIA into the loch on a solo training flight from RAF Heathfield. The Spitfire was serial number P7540, carrying the marking DU-W. An eyewitness saw the Spitfire flying low over the surface of the loch when Hekl banked the aircraft to starboard and its starboard wingtip caught the water surface. Hekl lost control and the aircraft broke up and sank, leaving only a patch of oil on the water. An RAF salvage crew brought a boat and spent several days trawling parts of the bed of the loch, but failed to find either the aircraft or Hekl's body. In 1977 the Dumfries branch of the Scottish Sub Aqua Club began a systematic search of the bed of the loch in the area where an eyewitness thought the aircraft had crashed. In 1979 several clubs from the Northern Federation of British Sub- Aqua Clubs joined the search, and Blackpool Sub-Aqua Club took over organisation of the project. The search was unsuccessful so in 1982 it was moved to a different area of the loch, where divers quickly found the Spitfire's tail and rear part of the fuselage. In subsequent dives other parts of the aircraft were found, scattered over a distance of 200 metres. Both wings were badly damaged, magnesium parts such as the undercarriage wheels had corroded away, but the Merlin Mk XII engine was recovered in good condition. Hekl's body was not found. The wreckage was moved to Dumfries and Galloway Aviation Museum, where the aircraft was slowly restored and a pair of replica wings fitted. Restoration to non-flying condition was completed in 2017.

The name means \\"the place behind the rows\\", i.e., behind the market rows adjacent to the Red Square. History This section is based upon P. V. Sytin's \\"History of Moscow Streets\\"Russian: П. В. Сытин, \\"Из истории московских улиц\\", М.: 1948 (Sytin, pp. 32–34) Zaryadye is the oldest trading settlement outside the Kremlin walls. The first chronicle notice is dated 1365, when a fire destroyed the area. Fires continued in 1390, 1468, 1493, 1547; in 1451, the fire was set by Tatar raiders. Zaryadye's Main Street (Великая улица), later called Mokrinsky Lane (Мокринский переулок), connected Kremlin with the docks and warehouses on Moskva River; some sources call it the first street of Moscow outside Kremlin walls. In 1536–1538, the walls of Kitai-gorod fortress separated Zaryadye from the river; access to the river was possible only through the gates in south-western and south-eastern corners of the neighborhood. The businesses changed their logistics pattern, walking away from river trade to supplies by land. Population of traders became more and more diluted by craftsmen and court servants. Peter I reforms struck two blows at Zaryadye. First, when the court relocated to Saint Petersburg, the area lost the tenants, many businesses closed. Second, Peter's rampart, built between Kitai-gorod wall and the river, closed all the sewage moats, trapping all the waste inside Zaryadye. For at least a century, Zaryadye became an unhealthy and unsafe social bottom of Moscow. Zaryadye map in 1881 Things improved after the fire of 1812. The State, fearing future fires, banned all wooden construction.The ban was issued by Catherine in 1775 and referred to Kremlin and Kitai-gorod only. Poorer landlords of Zaryadye could not afford stone buildings and sold their properties. They were purchased by real estate developers, who quickly converted Zaryadye into an area of cheap rental housing, usually two or three stories high. For nearly a century, Zaryadye was the location of Moscow's garment industry, a backyard of the wealthy Kitai- gorod. Since 1826, Glebovskoye Podvorye (Глебовское подворье), an inn in Zaryadye, was the hub of Moscow's Jewish community.Russian: Official site, Jewish congress of Russia www.keroor.ru In 1856, Jews were allowed free settlement in the city, and preferred settling nearby, in Zaryadye. By 1891, Moscow housed an estimated 35,000 Jews, at least half of them settled in Zaryadye (the first synagogue opened in 1891 two blocks north-east).Russian: Jewish Encyclopedia After 1918, with the collapse of traditional small business, Zaryadye tenants relocated to the remote workers' neighborhoods. The properties were taken over by state offices. Destruction Demolition of Rossiya, February 3, 2007 The 1935 master plan of Moscow called for demolition of Zaryadye, clearing space for the Industry Building (Narkomtiazhprom) and its riverside ramps. This project did not materialize as planned. The first round of destruction (1936) cleared the blocks adjacent to Moscow Kremlin for the ramps of Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge. This was followed by the destruction of most of Zaryadye in 1947, clearing the ground for the skyscraper designed by Dmitry Chechulin. This project was cancelled at the foundation stage. A 1947 postcard shows that, in addition to the existing row of churches on Varvarka Street, this round of demolition spared the 2-story buildings on Moskvoretskaya Street, right next to the bridge, and the Kitai-gorod wall facing the river. According to P. V. Sytin,Sytin, p. 34 the historical church of St. Anna and other relics had to be disassembled and rebuilt in the Kolomenskoye park; this did not materialize. The site was left vacant for over 15 years. A third round, in the 1960s, cleared these buildings near the bridge. In 1967, Rossiya Hotel was built on this site.

Loch Doon Castle was a castle that was located on an island within Loch Doon, Scotland. The castle was dismantled and rebuilt on the side of the loch after the loch water level was raised in the 1930s for a hydro-electric scheme. Loch Doon Castle was built in the late 13th century on an island within Loch Doon. The castle consists of an eleven-sided curtain wall. The castle was in the hands of the Earls of Carrick in the 13th century. During the Scottish Wars of Independence it was held by the governor Sir Gilbert de Carrick (Gille Brighde) who surrendered it to the English. It was soon recovered by the forces of King Robert I of Scotland. In 1306 the Corrie family were the hereditary keepers of Castle Loch Doon, and 57 years later, owing to the marriage of Sir Robert Corrie to Lady Susanna Carlisle, added greatly to their possessions in Dumfriesshire. The castle later fell to the English and was re-captured in 1314. The castle was besieged in 1335. During the 15th century the castle was in the hands of the Kennedy family. The castle was taken from them by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas after a siege in 1446. Having been given back to the Kennedy family the castle was again taken from them by William Crauford of Lefnoris in 1511. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century by King James V of Scotland as part of a general policy of reducing the power of the barons of Galloway. Top view of the original site.

It is the only mainland settlement in the Upernavik Archipelago, located near the western tip of the Nuussuaq Peninsula, on the northern coast of Sugar Loaf Bay, an indentation of Baffin Bay. The settlement was founded in 1923 as a trading station, growing in size during the post-war consolidation phase, when hunters from several small villages in the region of neighboring Inussulik Bay, Sugar Loaf Bay, and Tasiusaq Bay moved into the larger settlements such as Nuussuaq and Kullorsuaq further north in Melville Bay. Today Nuussuaq remains one of the most traditional hunting and fishing villages in Greenland, with a stable population. The settlement had 181 inhabitants in 2020.  History  Dogsleds remain the means of transport in the winter  Prehistory  The Upernavik Archipelago belongs to the earliest-settled areas of Greenland; the first migrants arriving approximately 2,000 years BCE All southbound migrations of the Inuit passed through the area, leaving behind a trail of archeological sites. The early Saqqaq culture diminished in importance around 1.000 BCE, followed by the migrants of Dorset culture, who spread alongside the coast of Baffin Bay, being in turn misplaced by the Thule people in the 13th and 14th centuries. The archipelago has been continuously inhabited since then.  20th century  Nuussuaq was founded in 1923 as a trading post, during the modern northbound migration of Greenlanders from Upernavik. The settlement was initially populated by hunters from the now abandoned villages of the region: Kuuk, Itissaalik (abandoned in 1957), and Ikermiut (abandoned in 1954). Not all of the initial wave of settlers from these villages of fewer than 10 people remained in Nuussuaq, but by the end of the 1920s, other families arrived in place of the hunters who moved north to Kullorsuaq in Melville Bay, and the community began to slowly grow. Between 1930 and 1960, northwestern Greenland underwent a consolidation phase, driven by the Danish colonial authorities via Royal Greenland, then part of KNI, with a countrywide monopoly on trade. The mutual agreement between the hunting families and the trade company limited the pre-war northward expansion until the 1950s, when the populations of the smaller settlements reinforced larger communities in Nuussuaq and Kullorsuaq, where the physical limit of uninhabitable Melville Bay presented a natural barrier to expansion. Today Nuussuaq remains one of the most traditional hunting and fishing villages in Greenland.  Geography  Nuussuaq is located in the northern part of Upernavik Archipelago, a vast archipelago of small islands on the coast of northeastern Baffin Bay.Upernavik Avannarleq, Saga Map, 1:250.000, Tage Schjøtt, 1992 The settlement straddles a small rock spur jutting off Nuussuaq Peninsula, on the northern coast of Sugar Loaf Bay, an indentation of Baffin Bay. The name of both the settlement and the peninsula means \\"a large tip\\" in the Greenlandic language. Nuussuaq is the only mainland settlement between Ukkusissat in the Uummannaq Fjord region and Pituffik, near Thule Air Base. All other settlements of the archipelago are insular.Upernavik, Saga Map, 1:250.000, Tage Schjøtt, 1992 The rock spur off Nuussuaq Peninsula encloses a small inlet of Sugar Loaf Bay from the south, met by another spur in the west, nearly closing off the inlet, with a small island between the two spurs. The inlet provides good harbourage and protection from the open waters of Baffin Bay, a deciding factor for the foundation of the settlement. The western spur is called \\"Qallunaaq Arnaq\\" (old spelling: Qavdlunâq Arnaq) − literally: \\"Danish Woman\\" in the Greenlandic language − named so for its shape resembling brassiere, at one time a novelty. The name is not unique to the region: an identically named hill of similar shape is located in western Greenland, east of Sisimiut, on the shores of Ikertooq Fjord. The protection offered by the inlet is complemented by several factors facilitating settlement: two freshwater lakes are located immediately to the east of the village, while the southern coast of Nuussuaq Peninsula is protected from northward winds in the winter. The short distance () from Nuussuup Nuua − the western cape of the long Nuussuaq Peninsula − placed the settlement on the old maritime route from Upernavik, through the islands of Tasiusaq Bay, to Kullorsuaq in Melville Bay.  Economy  Hunting and fishing are the mainstay of the area, although the more northern settlements still rely on traditional hunting of fur seals, walruses, and whales to supplement the family economy. In that, the northern region is culturally linked with the far north of Greenland (), the Qaanaaq region. Outside of Upernavik town, the average level of income in the archipelago is amongst the lowest in Greenland. Alongside three other settlements in the archipelago (Naajaat, Kullorsuaq, and Upernavik Kujalleq), Nuussuaq is listed in the top 10 poorest within Greenland. On 28 August 2010, a fish processing factory of Upernavik Seafood was opened in Nuussuaq, joining the set of 8 other such factories in the Upernavik Archipelago. Apart from the communal all-purpose Pilersuisoq store, the factory is the first business enterprise in the settlement.  Transport  Air Greenland serves the village as part of government contract, with twice-weekly helicopter flights to Kullorsuaq and Upernavik.  Population  In 2010, Nuussuaq had 204 inhabitants. The population of the settlement has slowly increased over the last two decades, reflecting the trend in the neighboring Kullorsuaq.

It records the sending of seventy disciples by Jesus, the famous parable about the Good Samaritan, and his visit to the house of Mary and Martha.Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an Abbreviated Bible Commentary. 23rd edition. Zondervan Publishing House. 1962. The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that Luke composed this Gospel as well as the Acts of the Apostles.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. Text The Latin text of Luke 9:9–11:35 in Codex Gigas (13th century). Luke 10:38-42 in Papyrus 3 (6th/7th century) The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 42 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 75 (written about AD 175-225) *Papyrus 45 (c. 250) *Codex Vaticanus (325-350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360) *Codex Bezae (c. 400) *Codex Washingtonianus (c. 400) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450) *Papyrus 3 (6th/7th century; extant verses 38-42). Old Testament references *: Psalm Narrative of the Seventy Protestant theologian Heinrich Meyer calls this section (verses 1-16) the \\"Narrative of the Seventy\\" and links it to the earlier account of the sending out of advance messengers in Luke 9:52.Meyer, H. A. W. (1873), Meyer's NT Commmentary on Luke 10, accessed 12 June 2012 The return of the seventy concludes this section (verses 17-20). This passage includes Jesus's assertion that \\"the laborer is worthy of his wages\\", which is reflected in similar wording in : :For the Scripture says, \\"You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain\\", and \\"The laborer is worthy of his wages\\". The first of these statements is found at , but the second statement is not found in the Old Testament, leading to the suggestion that the author of the letter to Timothy may have referred to Luke or the equivalent verse in Matthew.Meyer, H. A. W. (1873), Meyer's NT Commentary on 1 Timothy 5, accessed 22 July 2020 Verse 16 :\\"He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.\\" This verse offers confirmation in principle of the fact that Jesus placed on equal grounds the cities which reject the seventy and those which reject Himself. In the second part, the saying rises to a climax: a deepening of the emotion, a solemn conclusion. Matthew's parallel text is entirely positive: :“He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward.\\" Luke's treatment retains the positive side of the seventy's potential reception but places more emphasis on the negative.Nicoll, W. R., Expositor's Greek Testament on Luke 10, accessed 23 July 2020 The Great Commandment and the Parable of the Good Samaritan  The Parable of the Good Samaritan by Jan Wijnants (1670) shows the Good Samaritan tending the injured man. A lawyer or 'expert in the law' asked Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life. Jesus asked him what was written in the law, and the lawyer referred to the teaching in , :You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and to the ordinance of Leviticus 19:18, :You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself. Jesus confirmed that the lawyer's answer was correct. Luke's treatment of this Great Commandment differs from those of Mark and Matthew, where Jesus directly instructed his disciples that these are the greatest commandments in the Law. The lawyer then asked who his 'neighbour' is. In response, Jesus told a story of a traveller (who may or may not have been a Jew Joel B. Green, The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 429.) who is beaten, robbed, and left half dead along the road. First a priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a journeying Samaritan comes by. Samaritans and Jews generally despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. This parable is recounted only in this chapter of the New Testament. Portraying a Samaritan in a positive light would have come as a shock to Jesus's audience.Funk, Robert W., Roy W. Hoover, and the Jesus Seminar. The five gospels, HarperSanFrancisco. 1993. \\"Luke\\" p. 271-400 Some Christians, such as Augustine and John Newton,Newton, J., The Good Samaritan, accessed 13 June 2018 have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul.Caird, G. B. (1980). The Language and Imagery of the Bible. Duckworth. p. 165. Others, however, discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable's original meaning, and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.Sanders, E. P., The Historical Figure of Jesus. Penguin, 1993. p. 6. The parable has inspired painting, sculpture, poetry and film. For example, Vincent van Gogh's painting, The Good Samaritan, after Delacroix 1890, captures the reverse hierarchy of Luke's parable. Although the priest and Levite are near the top of the status hierarchy in Israel and the Samaritans near the bottom, van Gogh reverses the traditional hierarchy in his painting. He foregrounds the Samaritan, transforming him into a colorful figure who is larger than life, while the priest and Levite are in the background, small and insignificant.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 26-30 at p. 29. The colloquial phrase \\"good Samaritan\\", meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many hospitals and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan. Mary and Martha In Luke's account, the home of Martha and Mary is located in 'a certain village'.Luke 10:38 Bethany is not mentioned and would not fit with the topography of Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, which at this point in the narrative is just commencing as he leaves Galilee. John J. Kilgallen suggests that \\"Luke has displaced the story of Martha and Mary\\".Kilgallen, J.

The civil parish was created in 1949 from the former civil parish of Stowey and part of the civil parish of Chew Magna.Vision of Britain website Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. It was before 1974 that the parish was part of the Clutton Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The Stowey Sutton Neighbourhood Development Plan has been developed by Bath and North East Somerset being a part of Council’s development plan according to section 38A(4) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. This decision was taken because 95% of people have voted in favour of the Plan in the Stowey Sutton Neighbourhood Plan referendum on Friday 7 August 2015. Folly Farm Near to the village is Folly Farm, a 17th-century farm with traditionally managed, unimproved, neutral grassland, flowery meadows and woodlands with splendid views run by Avon Wildlife Trust.

Peretti (December 6, 1916 - May 1, 1986) was an American songwriter and record producer. Born in New York City to an Italian American family, Peretti began his music career as a teenager, playing the trumpet in the Borscht Belt in upstate New York. He graduated to playing with orchestras, then in the 1950s partnered with his cousin Luigi Creatore to form the Hugo & Luigi songwriting team that evolved to producing records. In 1957 they bought into Roulette Records, where they wrote songs for various artists such as Valerie Carr, and produced major hits for Jimmie Rodgers, including \\"Honeycomb\\" (Billboard #1), \\"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine\\" (Billboard #3), \\"Oh-Oh, I'm Falling in Love Again\\", and \\"Secretly\\". Two years later, Peretti and Creatore signed a contract with RCA Records, where they produced recordings for pop crooner and NBC television personally Perry Como. They also produced recordings for Sam Cooke and Ray Peterson and wrote English lyrics for the South African composer Solomon Linda's song \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\",. which became a hit for The Tokens.Linda's family settled a lawsuit over the song in 2006. With George David Weiss they co-wrote \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" for RCA's mega-star Elvis Presley. Peretti and Creatore also wrote Presley's hit single Wild in the Country. In 1964, Peretti and Creatore left RCA to join Weiss in writing Maggie Flynn, a 1968 Broadway musical about the American Civil War. In the 1970s, Peretti and Creatore owned part of Avco Records and then established H&L; Records, which they operated until retiring at the end of the decade. Among their successes were recordings by The Stylistics and The Softones. They also won the 1977 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album as producers of Bubbling Brown Sugar. Peretti met and married singer June Winters in 1943. They formed a children's record label, Mayfair Records, in 1946 and released a series of bestselling albums featuring Winters as the \\"Lady in Blue\\". They had two daughters, Kathy and Tina Marie. Winters died on March 29, 2015 at the age of 96. Peretti died in 1986 in Englewood, New Jersey, aged 69.

It was founded in Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 1986. Its headquarters are still located in Pine Bluff with additional offices in Little Rock, Arkansas, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Memphis, Tennessee. Its parent company, Walgreens, operates Super D Drug Stores and Ikes Deep Discount Drug, both acquired in October 1997, and May's Drug, Med-X Drug, Drug Warehouse, and Drug Mart, all acquired in July 2004, as \\"Part of the USA Drug Family\\". Wal-Mart and CVS/Pharmacy are two of its primary competitors. The company's slogan is \\"America's Low Price Drug Store\\". Steve LaFrance stepped down as CEO on October 20, 2006 and named Joe Courtright CEO of the company. Courtright was named president of the company in September and was vice president of pharmacy for Region 2 previous to that. LaFrance maintained a presence with the company as chairman. On July 5, 2012, Walgreens announced the acquisition of USA Drug.Walgreen, on a Buying Binge, Announces Another Deal In September 2012, Walgreens announced that they will be closing 76 USA Drug affiliated stores by November. Walgreens took ownership on September 15, 2012. Steve Lee LaFrance SR. was born in 1941 in New Orleans and earned a bachelor of science in pharmacy degree at Northeast Louisiana State College of Monroe. After graduation, LaFrance took a pharmacist position at the Medic Pharmacy in Shreveport. Four years later, LaFrance worked 12 hours, six days a week, in Pine Bluff. He built Gibson’s pharmacy into a thriving business. Later he got the opportunity to buy another pharmacy just down the street but could not come up with the funds. After being turned down by several banks for loans, he finally secured the five thousand he needed to start the business. He expanded the stores to where by 2012 he had more than 150 stores. LaFrance also started SAJ Distributors in the 1970s. SAJ allowed him to buy directly from vendors so he could sell at a better margin. SAJ grew to be the provider of more than 22,000 health, beauty and general merchandise products to over 1000 grocery, drug and discount stores. Upon making 26 dollars on opening day in 1968 at the first USA Drug in Pine Bluff, that profit went a lot further than LaFrance had ever dreamed possible. From the modest upbringing and start, LaFrance built the USA Drug chain into the largest privately owned pharmacy chain in the United States. USA Drug covered nine different states, with 150 different locations in 825 million dollars in annual sales, and supported more than 3500 employees and their families. In 2012, shortly before LaFrance passed, Walgreens acquired USA Drug for more than 550 million dollars, all from a 26 dollar opening day.

Graham (December 27, 1886 Kiev, Russia – June 27, 1961 London, England) was a Russian Empire-born American Modernist / figurative painter, collector and mentor of modernist artists in New York City. Born Ivan Gratianovitch Dombrowsky in Kiev, Russian Empire into an aristocratic family, he studied law before serving as a cavalry officer in World War I. He was briefly imprisoned after the Bolsheviks came to power in 1918 in the Russian Revolution, and fled to Warsaw, returning to fight with \\"the Whites\\". After the resistance collapsed, in 1920 he immigrated to the United States with his second wife. He soon adopted John as the English version of his first name, and took John D. Graham as his legal name when he became a US citizen in 1927. He studied painting for the first time in his 30s, becoming deeply interested in modernism. In addition to gaining attention for his own work, he championed the new movement as a collector and curator. He was a mentor to a younger generation of American artists, who developed the style of Abstract Expressionism in the New York area. In the 1940s and 1950s, Graham developed a new figurative style derived from classical masters, which he first showed in paintings and drawings of Russian soldiers. He died in London, England. Military career Born Ivan Gratianovitch Dombrovsky (also spelled Dabrowsky) into the aristocratic class, with parents of Polish and Russian descent, he received a classical education and later attended law school. He served as a cavalry officer in the Circassian Regiment of the Russian Imperial army. During World War I, he earned the Saint George's Cross. After the execution of Czar Nicholas II and his family in 1918 by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Dombrovsky was briefly imprisoned as a counterrevolutionary, because of his class. He fled for a time to his mother's native Poland, which gained independence for a time after WWI. (It had been part of the Russian Empire). There he lived in Warsaw. He returned to fight in the Crimea with \\"the Whites\\", counter-revolutionaries, but decided to leave when the resistance collapgsed. Immigration to the United States In 1920, Dombrovsky immigrated to the United States with his second wife, Vera, and their son Nicholas. They settled in New York City. He began calling himself John (Ivan in English) in the US, and had his name officially changed to John D. Graham upon becoming a United States citizen in 1927.Biographical information from A Finding Aid to the John Graham Papers, 1799-1988 by Megan McShea, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution http://www.aaa.si.edu/collectionsonline/grahjohn/overview.htm Artistic career Still under the name Dombrovsky (also spelled Dabrowsky), John began to study painting for the first time at the Art Students League of New York. There he also briefly assisted painter John F. Sloan, known as one of the Ashcan School. Dabrowsky soon attracted attention for his art. In 1925 he relocated to Baltimore with his third wife, artist Elinor Gibson. They had a son David Graham. The son later married Patricia Thompson, and died before his father in Windermere, Florida. Patricia Thompson Graham later gave numerous works by his father to MOMA in New York. Other of Graham's relatively small collection of remaining works are in her sisters Kathryn and Jean's portfolios. While in Baltimore, Graham joined a group called The Modernists. He served as their secretary and exhibited in their gallery.\\"Graham Stages Original Show,\\" The Baltimore News-American (February 1926). John D. Graham papers, Archives of American Art In this period, in addition to painting, Graham established himself as an art connoisseur and collector. He was greatly interested in developing knowledge of advances and changes in the art world, and kept in touch with what was taking place in Europe as well as the US. Beginning in the 1930s, Graham became associated with the New York School as an artist and impresario. In that decade, he was painting in the abstract, post-cubist style of Pablo Picasso, who exerted wide leadership from Paris. Graham was a close friend with artists Wilhelmina Weber Furlong and her husband Thomas Furlong of the Art Students League.The Biography of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong: The Treasured Collection of Golden Heart Farm by Clint B. Weber, Smithsonian Archives of American Art Oral history interviews with Dorothy Dehner, 1965 Oct.-1966 Graham and Elinor Gibson were divorced in 1934, and she kept custody of their son David. That year Graham met American Constance Wellman in Paris; they married in New York City in 1936 and lived in Brooklyn Heights. They were near other artists Adolph Gottlieb, David Smith, and Dorothy Dehner. Graham worked for Hilla Rebay, helping her found the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, which developed as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Along with many others, Graham and his wife struggled financially during the Great Depression. They moved to Mexico for its lower cost of living, and continued to live there on and off. Graham and Constance Wellman divorced after the end of World War II, on July 16, 1945.John D. Graham papers, 1799-1988, bulk 1890-1961, Smithsonian Archives of American Art During the 1940s Graham married for the fifth time, to Marianne Schapira. She had a grown daughter, Ileana Sonnabend, who was then married to Leo Castelli. They both became influential in the New York art world and were known as independent gallery owners and dealers.Smith, Roberta. \\"Ileana Sonnabend, Art World Figure, Dies at 92.\\" New York Times, October 24, 2007. Graham served as a mentor to younger artists such as Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and Arshile Gorky. He introduced Ileana and Leo Castelli to his artist friends in the New York art world.Charles Darwent (October 27, 2007), Ileana Sonnabend - Queen of the SoHo art world The Independent. He was also considered influential to Lee Krasner (Pollock's wife and an artist in her own right), David Smith, Dorothy Dehner, and Mark Rothko. Graham claimed to have befriended Picasso and many other important European modernists while living in Paris and in Russia. He often entertained and lectured the younger American artists in New York City about modernist ideas. He was frequently the bearer of radical new insights into art and creativity. In 1942 Graham curated a group show at the McMillan Gallery that exhibited work by Jackson Pollock (in his first exhibition in New York City), Lee Krasner, Willem de Kooning, and Stuart Davis. He showed them with work by well-established European artists: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Pierre Bonnard, and Amedeo Modigliani. Along with Stuart Davis and Hans Hofmann, Graham is considered a mentor for the younger American artists above, who comprised many of the Abstract expressionist generation of American painters and sculptors. He was the author of System and Dialectics of Art (1937), a treatise on art, modernism and the avant-garde.

He signed these paintings with \\"Ioannus\\", the Latin form of John and Ivan. Among his first works in this style were paintings and drawings of Russian soldiers completed about 1943, drawn from his own experience in the imperial army during World War I. Graham died in London in 1961. After his death, Graham's art of his last two decades was the subject of increasing scholarly and market interest.

Syntactically, Ogea is a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) language, with adjectives following nouns, and deictics following adjectives—the reverse of English. Morphologically, Ogea is a highly inflected, suffixing language, with most of the complexity occurring with verbs. There are over 100 basic verbal suffixes, the number of which is significantly multiplied by allomorphic variants. Ogea sentences are often composed of chains of verbs, with suffixes indicating sentence medial versus final positions. Ogea verbs encode inter-clausal temporality (temporal succession—one action occurs following another—and temporal overlap—actions occur simultaneously). They also encode switch reference. Switch reference indicates whether the referents of the clause in question are referents in the following clause. It is useful to classify Ogea verbal suffixes into two major categories: endocentric and exocentric, following the lead of Staalesen and Wells. Endocentric suffixes occur between the verb root and the exocenter. Endocentric suffixes include manner, object, and benefactive suffixes, among others. The same set of endocentric suffixes are used with varying sets of exocentric suffixes. The endocenter is composed of the verb root plus the endocentric suffixes. Exocentric suffixes encode inter-clausal temporality, tense, mood, subject, and switch reference. They are termed exocentric because they may contain suffixes that relate to the clause that follows. That is, the inter-clausal temporality and switch reference relate the current clause to the one that follows it.

History and background  Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, recognized the role of conceptual output as early as 1997 in a speech at the University of Connecticut when he said \\"The growth of the conceptual component of output has brought with it accelerating demands for workers who are equipped not simply with technical know-how, but with the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and to interact effectively with others.\\"Speech by Alan Greenspan, University of Connecticut, October 14, 1997 By 2004, he had developed his views on the topic, referring to reductions in manufacturing in the United States, outsourcing to India and China, excess of supply and the global marketplace, all leading to the increasing conceptualization of economic output.Alan Greespan, The critical role of education in the nation's economy, At the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce 2004 Annual Meeting February 20, 2004 Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, 1987-2006 In his book A Whole New Mind, Daniel H. Pink explains how the economy is now moving from the information age to the conceptual age. He describes how abundance (over-supply), Asia (outsourcing) and automation contribute to the need for business to concentrate on cognitive or creative assets such as design, storytelling, teamwork, empathy, play and meaning. He bases his approach on brain functions explaining how qualities dependent on the left hemisphere of the brain (logic, knowledge) now need to be complemented by those associated with right-brained processes (intuition and creative thinking). Other contributors to our understanding of the conceptual economy include Tom Friedman who describes the opportunities of globalization in his book The World is Flat. He emphasizes the importance of the internet and personal computers for communications and software sharing across the globe. This explains how American companies are able to outsource a substantial portion of their business to India and China with no disruptions for the customer. Tom Kelley is also a key player in the field, both as general manager of IDEO, a highly successful design and innovation company, and the author of two widely acclaimed books: The Art of Innovation, highlighting the importance of brainstorming and teamwork in product creation; and The Ten Faces of Innovation, explaining the role of assets such as empathy, storytelling, individual experiences and stimulating work environments in fostering creative ideas. The key steps behind the conceptual economy fall into the following categories:  The evolving state of the economy  Until quite recently, our understanding of the economy was based on the premise that the way forward would depend on traditional values and qualifications such as those for accountants, lawyers, engineers, mathematicians or computer programmers. With the new opportunities resulting from globalization and the internet, the accepted forms of success are losing ground to scenarios drawing on innovative ideas. Here there is an increasing need for artists, designers and creative authors to contribute not only to product design but also to business management and strategic planning. Areas deserving particular attention are related to three key developments: Over- supply For the past 15 or 20 years, the Western economies (Europe, North America) have experienced a situation of fully dependable supply of basic goods, including round-the-year abundance of agricultural produce, with the result that a significant proportion of households have begun to look for more than just the basic necessities. Families now look for goods which extend beyond the basic norm such as organic foods or sophisticated digital television sets, mobile phones and cars with four-wheel drive, cruise control or integrated navigation systems. Outsourcing Given the low costs of labour in developing countries such as China, India and the Philippines, American and European companies are now outsourcing or offshoring an ever- increasing proportion of their production, manufacturing or service tasks to foreign countries. As a result, job opportunities in the West are slowly moving away from routine tasks such as accounting, telephone support services, computer programming and electronic component manufacturing. The efficiency of outsourcing has also been improving as the internet continues to provide increasingly reliable and ever faster global communications links. Automation In industry too, the development of robotics and automated manufacturing facilities means that opportunities for traditional jobs in industries such as automobile manufacturing and food processing are also diminishing. Ever higher levels of qualification are now required to contribute to operations that are largely computerized.Outsourcing: Job Killer or Innovation Boost? , Pete Engardio, Business Week, 8 November 2006 Mobile phones now offer a wide range of additional features  New areas of opportunity  Partly a result of the above factors, a wide range of new facilities and opportunities has begun to emerge. These include: * the development of appealing new internet-based facilities for sales and services, * transportation logistics for better coordination of component supply and product distribution, * customer-oriented interactive travel guides for more efficient and often cheaper travel abroad, * value-added products combining a number of services, often into one small unit, * computerized courseware to enhance on-the-job training, and * sophisticated design tools for greater production efficiency. Virtually every area of industry can benefit from developments of this kind both to improve the products themselves and to offer better marketing opportunities and after-sales services. As a result, these factors are seen as major contributors to increased productivity and economic growth.  Criteria for economic success  Drivers behind the conceptual economy, can be categorised into the following areas:Deborah L. Wince-Smith, The Conceptual Economy, in Competitiveness Index: Where America Stands, Council on Competitiveness, November 2006 Scholarship Educational institutions need to place more emphasis on creativity and the arts rather than on traditional qualifications in the areas of engineering and management. In particular, more attention needs to be devoted to basic literacy, analytical and critical thinking, synthesis and quantitative skills:The Literacy of America's College Students, Team of Research Analysts from the American Institutes for Research, January 2006 Creativity and artistry Until now, information technology has had considerable impact on the economy. Increasingly, success will depend on how to make use of the knowledge and information that has emerged. Here qualities such as intuition, creativity and game-based approaches will become ever more important. Cultural and technical diversity Prosperity and competitiveness in the 21st century will depend on an understanding of diverse national cultures and how to draw on their ideas in order to assist the innovation process. Here too, there will be a need for more extensive teamwork, creativity and leading-edge thinking, all in the context of the global economy.

Biography Charles was born in Brunswick, the eldest son of Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In April 1808, his mother, Princess Marie of Baden (1782–1808), died shortly after giving birth to a stillborn daughter when Charles was only three years old. Charles and his younger brother William, went to live with their maternal grandmother, Princess Amalie of Hesse- Darmstadt, in Glückstadt, while his father raised a volunteer corps, the Black Brunswickers, to fight with the Austrians against Napoleon. In the Autumn of 1809, to avoid capture the duke had conducted a remarkable fighting march across Germany and escaped to Britain with his troops; on his arrival in London he sent for his sons who then lived with their paternal grandmother, Princess Augusta of Great Britain at Blackheath and later at Vauxhall. (Chapter 10) The young princes were treated as celebrities in London, with William being given the honour of laying a foundation stone for Vauxhall Bridge in 1814. After the death of his father in 1815, Charles inherited the Duchy, but since he was still underage, he was put under the guardianship of George, the Prince Regent of the United Kingdom and Hanover. When Charles neared his 18th birthday, a dispute over the date of his majority erupted; Charles claimed majority at the age of 18, while George considered the age of majority to be 21 years. A compromise was made, and Charles reached his majority at the age of 19, and took over government on 30 October 1823. During his 18th year, Hanover speedily rushed in a new constitution which limited his powers, redefined his duchy, hereditary lands, and his due income as head of the house of Este-Guelph. As from 1546 forwards Hanover also paid the Dynastic fidei commis payments to the Wolfenbuettel princes, as heads of house. Until this new redefinition, all of Hanover was considered sub-principalities that conditionally governed in the name of the Wolfenbuettel ruling prince. These sub-principalities included Hanover-Calenberg and Luneburg, the new council of Vienna creation of Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 notwithstanding. On May 10, 1827, Charles declared in an edict that the new constitution of redefining his sovereignty was invalid. Passing a new constitution during a Regency was also protested for him by Austria. These had gone against all the norms of international law. In the edict Hanover was called a \\"usurper\\", and this caused outrage in Hanover and England. The German Confederation that same year attempted to intervene in this matter and ordered Charles to accept the new constitution from his minority. Charles disregarded it, and continued governing as his father had. He did not have his decrees cosigned, but continued as an absolute monarch, as the Guelphs had been for more than 1,000 years. The ownership of the printing presses ultimately won the battle as the popular opinion was turned against their monarch. Charles's administration was maligned as being corrupt and misguided.O. Hohnstein: Geschichte des Herzogtums Braunschweig, Braunschweig 1908, pp. 465–474. When in 1830 the July Revolution broke out, Charles happened to be in Paris. He hurriedly returned to Brunswick, where he announced his intention to suppress all revolutionary tendencies by force. But on 6 September, he was attacked by stone throwers while riding home from the theatre; on the next day, a large mob tried to break into the palace. Charles fled and Gerhard Schildt: Von der Restauration zur Reichsgründungszeit, in Horst-Rüdiger Jarck / Gerhard Schildt (eds.), Die Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte. Jahrtausendrückblick einer Region, Braunschweig 2000, pp. 753–766. the palace was completely destroyed by fire. When Charles's brother, William, arrived in Brunswick on 10 September, he was received joyfully by the people. William originally considered himself only his brother's regent, but after a year declared himself ruling duke. Charles made several desperate attempts to depose his brother by diplomacy and by force, but they were unsuccessful. Charles reportedly had agreements from the French King to send a mercenary army to retake the duchy. Charles continued to be active in his office as ruling prince in exile. He filed many protests against Hanover, against his brother, and against Prussia's violent annexation of the Duchy. In his later letters he predicted communism would take the lands from the Prussians. Charles spent the rest of his life outside of Germany, mostly in Paris and London. While he lived in London he engaged in a high- profile feud with the publisher Barnard Gregory due to articles published about the Duke in The Satirist. After the war between France and Germany broke out, he moved to Geneva, where he died in the Beau-Rivage Hotel in 1873, aged 68. Brunswick Monument The Brunswick Monument on the Quai du Mont-Blanc, Geneva. In his will drawn up on 5 March 1871, Charles left all his entire estate to the city of Geneva with a single stipulation; that a mausoleum be built for him in Geneva \\"in a prominent position and worthy\\", that it should feature statues of his father, Frederick William, and his grandfather, Charles William Ferdinand, and that it should imitate the style of the 14th century Scaliger Tombs in Verona. Accordingly, a design was chosen by the Swiss architect Jean Franel. Sited on the Quai du Mont-Blanc, it is built in three storeys of white marble with a hexagonal canopy over a sarcophagus bearing a recumbent figure of the duke. At the projecting corners are marble statues of six notable ancestors of the House of Guelph by various sculptors, and a bronze equestrian statue of Duke William by the French sculptor Auguste Cain was originally mounted at the top of the spire. The monument stands on a platform 65 meters long and 25 meters wide and is guarded by marble chimeras and lions, also by Cain. The monument was unveiled on 14 October 1879; however, earthquake damage resulted in the removal of the equestrian statue to an adjacent plinth in 1883 and the top of the spire was rebuilt with a crown in 1890. The duke's estate amounted to 24 million Swiss Francs, two million of which were expended on the monument, the remainder was spent on a number of new public buildings, for example the Grand Théâtre. Legacy A contemporary obituarist referred to the Duke as \\"that painted, bewigged Lothario, whose follies, eccentricities, and diamonds made him the talk of Europe.\\" During his lifetime he sued several newspaper publishers for libel when they alleged that, among other things, he solicited homosexual encounters. However, in 1849 he won a defamation case for the publication of an article by a newspaper, The Weekly Dispatch, in 1830, after sending a manservant to procure archive copies of the edition from the publishers and the British Museum. No copies now survive, although given the Duke's other legal cases, the nature of the libel may be assumed. However this case (Brunswick v Harmer) established a precedent in English defamation law, as the ruling was interpreted by courts to allow defamation plaintiffs to sue if there was a “new publication” of the original libel. It was used, for example, in 2009 to decree that internet company Google, who made historical libels available on their web pages, could be liable for damages. The multiple publication rule was finally curtailed in the UK by The Defamation Act 2013.

He is best known for being the rhythm guitarist with Suicidal Tendencies, a band he played with from 1987 to 2012, and was the only member besides Mike Muir to return to the band when it reunited.http://metalstorm.ee/bands/band.php?band_id=399&bandname;=Suicidal%2BTendencies Metal Storm He originally played in the thrash metal band No Mercy of which Muir was also the vocalist. During Suicidal Tendencies' hiatus he was a member of the thrash band Creeper. Throughout his time with Suicidal Tendencies, Clark was very active in the band's songwriting, writing much of the music for his first album with the band, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today. His early compositions were mostly thrash-oriented but stuck to the bands already melodic sound. He continued to write music for the band that covered many different styles, best illustrated by The Art of Rebellion. As Clark claimed in an interview, \\"This is definitely our most diverse album yet, but it wasn't really planned that way, it's just the way we've grown musically.\\" Clark has had endorsement deals with B.C. Rich, Jackson and Yamaha guitars. He used to play a custom made BC Rich Gunslinger guitar with a skull wearing the classic Suicidal flip cap painted on it. Since the mid-1990s, he has played only Fernandes guitars, which he continues to endorse. Clark's early trademark image was his straight long hair and the \\"Suicidal\\" flip-cap. He has since cut his hair and began wearing a blue bandana. On May 31, 2012, in Santa Cruz, California, Clark suffered a head injury during a pre-show incident resulting in concussion that also required nine staples to a gash on his head. This prompted Clark to leave Suicidal Tendencies. He did, however, provide rhythm guitar on four tracks from the band's 2013 album 13 (\\"Shake It Out\\", \\"God Only Knows Who I Am\\", \\"Who's Afraid?\\" and \\"Cyco Style\\"), where he is credited as an \\"additional musician\\".

It follows a group of four con men, one con woman, and one forger in a complex set of plots and counterplots against individual marks, against the Bank of Korea, against the police, and against each other. Plot Choi Chang-hyeok (Park Shin-yang) is driving in his car, when he suddenly finds himself followed by the police. In the following chase he tries to get away, but as his car emerges from a tunnel it goes over the side, down a cliff and he is killed in the burning wreck. The reason he tried to get away, is that he had just left the Bank of Korea, where he was part of a scam, that got him and his four accomplices the neat sum of 5 billion won. He died, one of his accomplices was caught, and the other three disappeared – and so did all the money. Eol-mae (Lee Moon-sik) was the one caught by the police, and they try to get him to talk and reveal the scam and his accomplices. In flashbacks we see how the plan was hatched, and get to know the criminals. The police tries to find out more about the killed Chang-hyeok, and find his brother, who is the owner of a used book store. He has been at odds with his deceased brother, but now gets a big life insurance. This interests Seo In-kyeong (Yum Jung-ah) very much. She has been living with Mr. Kim (Baek Yoon-sik), who is a veteran con-artist and the money-man in the scam. In-kyeong got to know Chang-hyeok – and now wants to get to know his brother.

It lies south of Chew Valley Lake and north of the Mendip Hills, approximately south of Bristol on the A368 road Weston-super-Mare to Bath. Stowey and its neighbouring and larger village, Bishop Sutton, form the civil parish of Stowey Sutton.  History  There is some evidence of a possible wooden enclosure from the Iron Age known as Stowey Castle. There is also some evidence of an ochre crushing mill used for making pigment for marking sheep. During the 16th or 17th century, Stowey was a chapelry of Chew Magna. It had become a separate parish by the 19th century, part of the hundred of Chew. It became a civil parish in 1866. In 1949 the civil parish was abolished, and merged with part of the civil parish of Chew Magna to form the civil parish of Stowey Sutton.Vision of Britain website The early Lords of the Manor were the FitzRichard family. In the early 17th century it was held by the Jones family, who held it until 1840 when it was sold to Sir Edward Strachey.  Government  Stowey and Bishop Sutton make up the Stowey Sutton Parish Council, which has some responsibility for local issues, and is part of the Chew Valley South Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the Bath and North East Somerset Unitary Authority which has wider responsibilities for services such as education, refuse, tourism etc. The village is a part of the North East Somerset constituency and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.  Geography  Along with the rest of South West England, Stowey has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between . July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around . In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west. There are several sites of Nature Conservation Interest and Special Scientific Interest in and around the village.  Folly Farm  Near to the village is Folly Farm, a 17th-century farm with traditionally managed, unimproved, neutral grassland, flowery meadows and woodlands with splendid views, run by Avon Wildlife Trust. Folly Farm includes two SSSIs — the meadows (19.36 hectares) and Dowlings Wood (9 hectares).  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Chew Valley South Ward (which includes Bishop Sutton and Stowey), had 1,222 residents, living in 476 households, with an average age of 40.3 years. Of these 76% of residents describing their health as 'good', 25% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.9% of all economically active people aged 16–74.

Landmarks = Sutton Court  Sutton Court, Stowey Sutton Court, also known as Stowey Court, is a large house built on the site of a 14th-century castle, with sections built in the 15th and 16th century. About 1558 (former date on a fireplace) Bess of Hardwick and her second husband, Sir William St. Loe, added a north-east wing with a parlour and chapel, which includes Tudor buttresses. The house was then left to her son Charles Cavendish, but later the property passed to the Strachey family. From about 1650–1700 it was the seat of Richard Jones and his son Sir William Jones, the Attorney General of England. Around 1800 it was the seat of the Strachey family including Richard Strachey and his brother John Strachey. Much of the house was remodelled in 1858 by Thomas Henry Wyatt. Life at Sutton Court was described by John St. Loe Strachey in his autobiographical book The Adventure of Living in 1922. It is a Grade II* listed building. A curtain wall to the north of Sutton Court with a gazebo is also listed. The Lodge is also Grade II listed.

He was born in Dorchester, New Brunswick. He competed across Canada, in several American promotions, and wrestled internationally for both Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council (WWC) and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in New Zealand. In Canada, where he spent the majority of his career, Cormier used the ring name Leo Burke. In the United States, however, he competed as Tommy Martin. Over the course of his career, Cormier held 46 wrestling championships. Several of his title victories came as part of a tag team with his brothers, three of whom were also professional wrestlers. He had long-term storyline feuds with such wrestlers as Cuban Assassin and Bret Hart, both of whom he later reconciled with and joined forces with to hold tag team championships. Since his retirement in 1992, he has also trained many wrestlers for both World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Cormier also competes in occasional wrestling matches and has been honored by both the Cauliflower Alley Club, a fraternal organization of professional wrestlers, and Stampede Wrestling, who inducted him into their hall of fame. Career Growing up in a wrestling family, Léonce Cormier decided at age six that he wanted to become a professional wrestler. He followed in the footsteps of his older brothers Yvon and Jean-Louis, who trained him to compete. 1960s Cormier made his professional debut in 1966. Competing in Central States Wrestling, an affiliate of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), he used the ring name Tommy Martin. He won his first championship belt on October 11, 1968 by defeating Bob Brown for the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship. Later that month, he gained another title when he formed a tag team with his brother Romeo (who was competing under the ring name Terry Martin) to win the Central States version of the NWA North American Tag Team Championship from Brown and Bob Geigel. The reign as tag team champions lasted for seven days before the Martins dropped the belts in a match against The Texas Outlaws (Dick Murdoch and Dusty Rhodes). The following month, Martin also lost the heavyweight championship to Rhodes. 1970s Cormier spent much of the early 1970s competing in the Maritimes for his brother Jean-Louis' Eastern Sports Association (ESA) (which owned International Wrestling, or IW) as both a singles and tag team wrestler. He did not want to use their name recognition to further his own career, so he took the last name of his friend, boxer Jackie Burke. The four Cormier brothers all competed in the territory and often joined forces in feuds with the promotion's top heel (villain) wrestlers. Burke won the IW North American Heavyweight Championship on June 22, 1971 by defeating Eric Pomeroy. The title reign lasted for three months; Gino Brito won the title from Burke during a match in Halifax, Nova Scotia, but Burke regained the championship five days later. On August 8, 1972. Burke teamed with his brother Romeo again (who was now wrestling as Bobby Kay) to win the ESA International Tag Team Championship. They held the title until the following June, when they dropped it to Fred Sweetan and Kurt Von Steiger. In August 1973, Burke became the first ESA Taped Fist Championship when the promotion awarded him the title. Burke next competed in the NWA's Amarillo, Texas territory. He teamed with another brother, Yvon, who competed under the ring name The Beast. In January 1974, they defeated Don Fargo and Hank James to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship, which they held for two months until a loss to Ricky Romero and Dory Funk, Jr.. Returning to the ESA, Burke had a short reign as IW North American Heavyweight Champion in May 1974, which he followed in July with another reign with the ESA International Tag Team Championship. Holding the title with his brother The Beast, Burke held the championship for less than one month before dropping it to Geto Mongol and Great Kuma. That month, he also dropped the Taped Fist Championship to Mongol but regained it in a rematch within days. The following year, he held the North American Heavyweight Championship twice more, defeating Bolo Mongol and Bob Brown. For the second victory, Burke substituted for Killer Karl Krupp, who was unable to compete. Although Burke won the match, the title was later returned to Brown after Brown appealed the decision, claiming that a substitute wrestler should not be eligible to win a championship. Burke also had one final reign with the Taped Fist Championship before vacating the title. Burke continued to compete for Central States Wrestling, and he teamed with The Beast in a tournament for the vacant NWA Western States Tag Team Championship. The brothers defeated Silver Streak and Ricky Romero in the finals on February 20, 1976 to win the belts but lost them in a rematch one week later. Returning from Texas to Nova Scotia, Burke became the only person ever to hold the ESA Maritimes Heavyweight Championship. He defeated The Brute to win the title; when the ESA closed in 1977, the title became part of Romeo Cormier (Bobby Kay)'s Trans- Canada Wrestling (TCW). TCW closed later the same year, and Burke's Maritimes Heavyweight Championship was retired. In 1976, Burke also defeated The Brute to begin another reign as IW North American Heavyweight Champion. He later dropped it to Michel Dubois but regained it by defeating Frenchy Martin on July 14, 1977. The title was also retired when TCW closed that month. Prior to the promotion closing, Burke also had a short reign with Hubert Gallant with the ESA Maritimes Tag Team Championship. While competing in Nova Scotia, Burke also challenged Terry Funk for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Burke controlled the majority of the encounter, but Funk intentionally got himself disqualified 55 minutes into the match. Because the title cannot change hands on a disqualification, Funk retained the belt. In 1977, Burke moved to Calgary, Alberta to compete for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling. He teamed with Hart's son Keith to win the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship in early 1977 by defeating The Cuban Assassins. Although they dropped the belts to The Royal Kangaroos, Burke was able to regain the title in September 1977 while teaming with his brother Romeo (who was then competing as Bobby Burke). On December 10, however, they lost the belts to Michel Martel and Mr. Hito. In the new year, Leo Burke focused on competing as a singles wrestler and won the Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship on several occasions. He defeated Don Gagne (formerly known as Frenchy Martin) for the first title and Michel Martel for the second. He won it once more, by defeating Larry Lane, before leaving the area to compete briefly in New Zealand. Competing for the NWA territory there, he won the New Zealand version of the NWA British Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship. He soon vacated the title, however, and returned to Stampede Wrestling. 1980s Upon his return to Calgary in 1980, Burke teamed with Keith Hart once again to win the promotion's International Tag Team Championship. He also began feuding with Keith's brother Bret Hart around that time. Burke defeated Mr. Sekigawa to win the North American Heavyweight Championship but lost it to Bret Hart later that year. He regained it in a rematch but dropped it to Hart once again. Burke returned to Canada's Atlantic Coast briefly to compete for Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling (AGPW) and won the promotion's North American Tag Team Championship with Hubert Gallant. They lost the belts to Cuban Assassin and Bobby Bass that summer, but Burke was able to regain the championship by teaming with Stephen Petitpas. AGPW only promoted shows in the summer, and Burke then returned to Calgary during AGPW's off-season; while there, he teamed with his brother Bobby Burke again to regain the International Tag Team Championship in December 1980. Two months later, he had another reign as North American Heavyweight Champion after defeating \\"Dr. D\\" David Schults (who later regained the title in a rematch). Another reign as NWA Central States Heavyweight Champion followed in November 1981, in which Cormier returned to his Tommy Martin ring name. Returning to Stampede Wrestling once again, Burke entered and won a tournament for the vacant North American Heavyweight Championship, defeating Duke Myers in the final match on March 21, 1982 to win the title. He dropped it back to Bret Hart three months later, however. He followed this with a brief return in August 1982 to AGPW, where he defeated Rick Valentine to win the AGPW United States Heavyweight Championship. On November 19, 1982, Burke teamed with his longtime rival Bret Hart to win the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship. After losing the title the following month, the feud resumed, and Burke defeated Hart for the North American Heavyweight Championship on January 14, 1983; the men continued to face each other, and Hart regained the championship that May. Around that time, Burke spent more of his time competing in Central and Eastern Canada. He wrestled for Maple Leaf Wrestling in Toronto, Ontario, where he feuded with Johnny Weaver. In the summer of 1983, he held both the AGPW United States Heavyweight Championship and the AGPW International Heavyweight Championship. He was also credited with an additional reign as United States Heavyweight Champion because he regained the title in a rematch after it was vacated due to a controversial match against The Spoiler. In February 1986, Burke had one final title reign in Stampede Wrestling, holding the International Tag Team Championship with Ron Ritchie. In 1987 he became the heel commentator for the nwa tv show in french, La Lutte Quatre Saisons, french version of World Wide Wrestling. Back in AGPW, Burke continued to win championships. He held the International Heavyweight Championship three more times from 1986 to 1989, and held the North American Tag Team Championship three times as well during that period. He won the tag team titles by reuniting with former partners Hubert Gallant and Stephen Petitpas; the third reign came with Cuban Assassin, a former enemy of the entire Cormier wrestling family. In the late 1980s Burke he decided to compete in Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council. He quickly won the promotion's top title, the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship, by defeating Caribbean wrestling veteran Carlos Colón on December 17, 1989. 1990s Burke held the WWC title until February 1990, when he dropped it to TNT. This was followed by a return to AGPW, where he held the tag team championship with his brother Bobby Kay. Back in Puerto Rico, Burke defeated Colón again on March 24, 1990, this time to win the WWC Television Championship. Four days later, he also won the WWC Caribbean Tag Team Championship while teaming with Chicky Starr. They won the title from Invader #1 and Invader #4 but dropped it back to them in May. Shortly after dropping the tag team title, Burke defeated Invader #1 in a singles match to win the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship. Burke's final title victory came in the summer of 1990, when he defeated Ron Starr to win the AGPW International Heavyweight Championship for a fifth time. Retirement After retiring from full-time wrestling, he went to Calgary in the early 1992. His old rival and real-life friend Bret Hart arranged a position for Cormier as a trainer for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment). Cormier helped train Ken Shamrock, Mark Henry, Adam Copeland (known as Edge in WWE), Jason Reso (known as Christian in WWE), and Andrew Martin (known as Test in WWE). He also trained two former Canadian Football League players for their careers in professional wrestling: former Edmonton Eskimo Jeff Thomas, who later opened his own wrestling training school, and former Ottawa Rough Rider Glenn Kulka, who went on to compete for the WWF. When Cormier's contract expired, he began training wrestlers for WWF rival World Championship Wrestling. In January 2002, he was hospitalized with sepsis and was put on life support before recovering. In November 2005, he underwent surgery to replace his right knee; this was followed by a left knee replacement in February 2006. He has had eight operations on his knees altogether. After his last surgery, WWE invited him back to resume training wrestlers, but Cormier declined. Since his retirement, he has worked in the now-closed bar at Calgary's Cecil Hotel and has also operated a mobile coffee and sandwich shop. Although Cormier considers himself retired from professional wrestling, he continues to compete from time to time. He was featured in a news video by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during a return to the Maritimes for a match in 1998. In June 2009, it was announced that he was participating in an Ultimate Championship Wrestling Legends Tribute Tour in Atlantic Canada alongside his former rival Cuban Assassin. In 2010, Burke refereed a match at the final wrestling card ever promoted at the Berwick Arena in Nova Scotia. Cormier has been inducted into the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2009, the Cormier wrestling family was honored by the Cauliflower Alley Club in recognition of their contributions to the sport. Bret Hart has described Burke as \\"one of the greatest Canadian wrestlers ever\\". Les Thatcher, who competed against Cormier, said that he, \\"technically, is probably one of the most sound performers that ever stepped foot in a ring\\". Michel Martel, who wrestled against Cormier for several championships, called him \\"a great worker\\" and \\"a professional in the ring and outside the ring\\". In 2013 Cormier appeared in the Victoria Pavilion, in Calgary, Alberta for the Hart Legacy Wrestling promotion. On April 29, 2017 Cormier appeared alongside the Cuban Assassin as special guests at the Ultimate Championship Wrestling 10th Anniversary event at the Halifax Forum. The pair would answer questions during a fan access event, reappearing later in the night during a match where an injured Nick Strong was replaced by Cuban Assassin.

It is the ninth novel featuring the mysterious Albert Campion and his butler/valet/bodyguard Magersfontein Lugg. Plot summary As Lugg is reading aloud the obituaries one morning, he comes across one for an old school nemesis of Campion. Remarkably, an anonymous letter inviting Campion to the funeral has also appeared in the morning post. R.I. “Pig” Peters is dead. So says the doctor that treated him. Five months later, Campion receives a panicked call from a friend, something about a murder. Campion drives down to the friend’s home where her father reveals the most assuredly dead body of R.I. “Pig” Peters, his head caved in no more than 12 hours earlier. Amazingly enough, some of the visitors from Peters' first funeral also appear, along with some not-so-grieving acquaintances of the late Pig. The little village is becoming very crowded. Now begins Campion’s search, which leads to a missing body, a grisly scarecrow and one too many beers for Lugg before he discovers the madman that planned more than a few murders. This is the only Albert Campion story told in the first person by Campion. Television In two series of BBC adaptations of Allingham's stories entitled Campion (shown in the United States by PBS), Campion was played by Peter Davison, Lugg by Brian Glover and Oates by Andrew Burt. In the first series, Peter Davison sang the title music himself. Campion adapted a total of eight novels, each of which was originally broadcast as two separate hour-long episodes.

As he always brought chocolate to the games when he was a boy, he got the nickname schoko. He was one of the most successful Austrian players in Italian football, as he played for 4 clubs over 7 years. Playing career=Club career Much-travelled Schachner started his professional career at local outfit Alpine Donawitz at 18 in the 1975/1976 season, earning a place in the national team after only one and a half season. He was duly picked up by Vienna giants Austria Wien but moved abroad to play in Italy for seven years, from 1981 to 1988, in A.C. Cesena (58 matches, 17 goals), Torino F.C. (85 matches, 18 goals) and Avellino (48 matches 13 goals). Schachner and Dirceu with Avellino in 1986–87 season In 1981 when Cesena was promoted to Serie A, the ultras changed their title to Weisschwarz Brigaden (meaning “Black-and- white Brigades” in German language) to honor the Austrian forward. He returned to Austria in 1988, moving from one club to another and mostly in the second division before finally hanging up his boots at 41 years of age at Eintracht Wels. International career He made his debut for Austria in a December 1976 World Cup qualification match against Malta and was a participant at the 1978 and 1982 FIFA World Cups.Record at FIFA Tournaments – FIFA He earned 64 caps, scoring 23 goals.Appearances for Austrian National Team – RSSSF His final international game was an August 1994 friendly match against Russia which was his farewell match since he was replaced by Harald Cerny early in the game and he had played his previous international over 4 years earlier. On 21 June 1978 at the World Cup held in Argentina he was among starting 11 of the Austrian team that beat the reigning champions, West Germany 3-2 and eliminated them from the competition, a historic match named “The Miracle of Cordoba”. Conversely, he was also a member of the Austrian team that lost 1–0 to West Germany in 1982 in the \\"Disgrace of Gijón\\" but distinguished himself by making an effort to actually play a normal game. Managerial career He started his career as a coach in the season 1999/2000 in FC Zeltweg and led them to promotion from 4th to 3rd division. In seasons 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 he coached FC Kärnten in the Austrian Football First League. Under his leadership the team got promoted to the Austrian Bundesliga and won the National Cup in the first year and the National Supercup in the second. In the season 2002/2003 Schachner trained Austria Wien in Austrian Bundesliga until he was replaced by Christoph Daum in early October despite an excellent start of the season. At the time of his dismissal the team lead the championship with seven points ahead of second place and just defeated Ukrainian Champions Shakhtar Donetsk 5:2 in the UEFA Cup. A few days after his dismissal he was hired by Grazer AK, which held the penultimate place in the Austrian Bundesliga. The team finished the season in second place behind Austria Vienna. In the season 2003/2004 Schachner led Grazer AK to win their first and so far the only national champions title. In the same season they also won the Austrian Cup. In season 2004/2005 the Grazer AK were runners-up in the Bundesliga and faced Liverpool of Rafael Benitez, the future winners of the title, in the third qualification round of Champions League, managing to win the return leg at Anfield 1:0, after the home defeat of 0:2. In January 2006 he was sacked by the club, officially to reduce costs, in real because he was in talks with several other clubs. He moved to TSV 1860 München who were in the 2nd Bundesliga at the time and avoided relegation only in the penultimate round. The club was going through difficult period in those years and faced economic problems. On 9 March 2007, he and TSV 1860 München agreed to terminate his contract at the end of the 2006–2007 season on 30 June. His successor was Marco Kurz. Schachner signed a new contract at SK Austria Kärnten in April 2007. He did not achieve the desired results with the newly formed team and was fired by the management in December of that year. In August 2008, Schachner replaced the coach of VfB Admira Wacker Mödling (Austrian First League), Heinz Peischl, who was fired for acquiring only 1 point in 5 games which left the team on the bottom of the ranking. With Schachner the team finished the season in the third place. Moreover, after 13 years Admira Wacker reached the National Cup final where they were defeated by Austria Wien 1:3. He remained as a coach in VfB Admira Wacker Mödling for the season 2009/10 before being replaced by their youth team coach on 26 April 2010, leaving the team in third place with 4 points behind the leader, struggling for promotion 6 rounds before the end of the season.

The call for the First Crusade touched off new persecutions of the Jews that would continue on and off for centuries. Background In the First Crusade, flourishing communities on the Rhine and the Danube were attacked by Crusaders, yet many were spared due to the efforts of the Papacy (see German Crusade, 1096). In the Second Crusade (1147) the Jews in France suffered especially. Philip Augustus treated them with exceptional severity during the Third Crusade (1188). The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the Shepherds' Crusades of 1251 and 1320. The attacks were opposed by the local bishops and widely condemned at the time as a violation of the crusades' aim, which was not directed against the Jews. However, the perpetrators mostly escaped legal punishment. Also, the social position of the Jews in western Europe distinctly worsened, and legal restrictions increased during and after the crusades. They prepared the way for anti-Jewish legislation of Pope Innocent III. The crusades resulted in centuries of strong feelings of ill will on both sides and hence constitute a turning point in the relationship between Jews and Christians. First Crusade=Defending in the Holy Land The Jews almost single-handedly defended Haifa against the crusaders, holding out in the besieged town for a whole month (June–July 1099) in fierce battles. During this time, a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state, there were Jewish communities all over the country. Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza.Katz, Shmuel. Battleground: Fact and Fantasy in Palestine.

All that could be ransomed were liberated by the summer of 1100. The few who could not be rescued were either converted to Christianity or killed.Goitein, \\"Contemporary Letters on the Capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders\\", pg. 166  Protection attempts by Christians in Western Christendom  Prior to the First Crusade, there are multiple accounts of cooperation between Christians and Jews. Not only was there economic collaboration, with Jews being involved in several industries such as trade, minting, and financial advising, but Jews and Christians were also social with one another, even attending each other's weddings and funerals.Jonathan M. Elukin, Living Together, Living Apart: Rethinking Jewish-Christian Relations in the Middle Ages (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2007), 83-84. As the Crusades began, many Jews were in danger of being killed. There are documented accounts of how, as the Crusades spread and reached different towns and cities, Christians stood up and attempted to protect the neighboring Jews. In the German city of Trier, the local bishop attempted to protect the Jews.Jonathan M. Elukin, Living Together, Living Apart: Rethinking Jewish-Christian Relations in the Middle Ages (Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2007), 80. The bishop was still new to the city, however, and did not have the political power necessary to band the town together. In the face of the crusaders' attack, the local bishop abandoned his attempt to save the Jews and told them that \\"You cannot be saved—your God does not wish to save you now as he did in earlier day. Behold this large crowd that stands before the gateway of the palace\\", as well as forcing them to choose between conversion and removal from his palace. Other German cities had similar experiences, with some towns such as Mainz having the local burghers fight against the incoming crusaders. Another German town, Cologne, hid all the local Jews among their Christian neighbors during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, spending the remainder of the holiday with the Christian acquaintances. Jewish crusade literature The end of the crusades brought with it many narratives coming from both Jewish and Christian sources. Among the better known Jewish narratives are the chronicles of Solomon Bar Simson and Rabbi Eliezer bar Nathan, The Narrative of the Old Persecutions by Mainz Anonymous, and Sefer Zekhirah, or The Book of Remembrance, by Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn. The Chronicle of Solomon Bar Simson (1140) is mostly a record of what happened during the period of the First Crusade. Bar Simson accurately discusses the martyrdom of the communities more than the rare conversion of individuals. It is widely accepted that Bar Simson really existed, but it is hard to be sure who wrote the Chronicle and for what purpose. The Chronicle of Rabbi Eliezer bar Nathan (mid 12th century) is known to be written by a person named Rabbi Eliezer bar Nathan, who was very popular in his time due to his writings. He is thought to have borrowed much of his information from Bar Simson, since much of the information is the same. His writing here is extremely emotional, taking on a more apocalyptic tone in a sense. There is a definite sense of personal experience coming out of this chronicle, experience with death and suffering within his community and others. This chronicle was extremely popular at the time, as several manuscripts were written about it in a myriad of places. The Narrative of the Old Persecutions (14th century), as the lack of the author's name implies, is from an unknown author. The main focus of this narrative is on Mainz, and takes a very realistic stance on the crusades. It tells of the complacency of Rhenish Jews, of the reactions that Mainz Jews had to news of other communities falling to the crusaders, and of their turn towards the Church to protect them, only to find more despair there. It also brings in some information coming from the late Middle Ages, of Jews being associated with well poisoning. Sefer Zekhirah (late 1160s, early to mid-1170s) has a very well known writer, Rabbi Ephraim, who was a well-known liturgist of his time. He was 13 during the Second Crusade, and is considered to be an eyewitness to many of the events that occurred during that time. This writing was rather popular itself, and consists of a series of poems, all expressing grief over the suffering of the Jews through metaphors and references to fables. His accounts, despite their very emotional appeal, are corroborated by other writings from the time and tend not to be so skewed as the two chronicles. The details behind these narratives can all be found in several secondary historical sources, including Robert Chazan's God, Humanity, and History and Shlomo Eidelberg's The Jews and the Crusades, each of which gives background to the narratives and discusses their effects on European Jewry and Christianity. Robert Chazan's In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews provides details as to the changes made in Jewish/Christian relations as a result of the First Crusade. He focuses on whether or not the crusades really had a salient impact on the Jews of the time and in the future, pointing out that persecution was nothing new to them, yet also talking about the importance of their being made extremely distinct within the European community by the crusades. They were no longer part of it to any great extent, but rather were made out to be part of the \\"others\\" as many in Europe already had been, such as atheists and pagans. Christian sources for information on general feelings after the First Crusade all focus on their acquisition of Jerusalem. William of Tyre, Fulcher of Chartres, the Venetian Treaty, the Travels of Saewulf, and John of Wurzburg's Pilgrim Guide all detail Jerusalem but have little, if anything, to say of Europe and the Jews. However, in the midst of the First Crusade there were several Christian documents on the crusaders' attacks of Jewish communities and the basis of those attacks. One such document is Albert of Aachen on the People's Crusade, which focuses on the unsanctioned, disorganized peasant crusades that occurred along with the organized crusades that went on to take Jerusalem. It provides the personal experiences of Aachen, who was in one of these peasant crusades, and provides accounts of the slaughter of several groups of Jews. He describes it as being either \\"judgement of the Lord\\" or \\"some error of mind,\\" and the killings as not only being indiscriminatory, but also with no exception. His account also shows the Church being able to achieve little in its attempts to prevent these massacres. Much of the focus of Christian writings of the time, however, was on the efforts to get to Jerusalem, though some accounts talk of the crusaders' distrust of the Byzantine Empire, accounts that show some of the reasoning for the Fourth Crusade and the sack of Constantinople. The Deeds of the Franks, which has an unknown author, is such an account, and has a clear bias against the Byzantines. Many of the writings on later crusades continue to focus on Jerusalem as well, until near the end of the crusades when Jerusalem stops being their focus and the return to stability in Europe does. Many of the secondary sources on this time period question how important the impact of the crusades was on both the Jewish and Christian communities. Robert Chazan's belief is that the effect was minimal in the end – both cultures were, in many ways, used to the persecution that was being enacted, and that this was just another step. R. I. Moore, within his book The Formation of a Persecuting Society, argues that the effect on Christians was huge, with their entire society gaining feelings of the need for separation from their Jewish neighbors, which allowed them to persecute further in the future. Ivan G. Marcus in his article The Culture of the Early Ashkenaz argues that the Jews pulled away from the Christian community physically, mentally, and spiritually due to the sheer ferocity and shocking nature of the crusades. All of these and more provide differing opinions on the results of the crusades, but all agree that the crusades caused a separation to occur between the two religions.

Magers previously worked for WLS-TV, the ABC owned-and-operated station in Chicago, Illinois. Magers formerly co-anchored the top-rated 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. broadcasts with Cheryl Burton and Kathy Brock, respectively. Magers is the brother of Paul Magers, a former television anchor and reporter for KCBS-TV, the CBS owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles. Early life and career Born in San Bernardino, California, Magers grew up in Cordova, Alaska and Ellensburg, Washington. Magers gained early broadcasting experience as a high school student in Toppenish, Washington, when he began to host radio shows as a part-time job. He began his professional career in television in 1965, when he joined KEZI-TV in Eugene, Oregon as a reporter and news contributor. He later produced and anchored the 11 p.m. newscast at KGW-TV in Portland, Ore. (1967–68). From 1968-74, Magers worked as a reporter and anchor at KPIX-TV in San Francisco, Calif.. He also hosted a Group W 30 minute weekly the nationally syndicated program in 1971 titled, \\"Ron Magers Electric Impressions\\".https://thesanfranciscosound.blogspot.com/2010/02/quicksilver- messenger-service_7244.html October 4–5, 1970: Winterland, Post Street At Steiner Street, San Francisco, CA.

Minneapolis – Saint Paul After moving to Minnesota, Magers was hired as the principal anchor for KSTP-TV, the ABC (formerly NBC) affiliate in Minneapolis – Saint Paul from 1974 to 1981. He was later joined by co-anchor Cyndy Brucato. This popular anchor team led the top-rated Twin Cities newscasts at that time. Chicago From 1981 to 1997, Magers co- anchored the 5, 6, and 10 p.m. newscasts of WMAQ-TV. Magers and then co-anchor Carol Marin made national headlines in early May 1997 when they left Channel 5. The decision to leave was in protest of the station's hiring of Jerry Springer as commentator for the 10:00 p.m. newscasts. WMAQ management allowed both anchors an early release from their contracts. Both thought that the addition of Springer would have given the broadcast an unnecessary tabloid feel. Springer only made two commentaries before he too left his position as contributor. Magers joined WLS in 1998 as a 5:00 p.m. anchor alongside Diann Burns. He became co-anchor of the 10:00 p.m. newscasts in 2002, after the retirement of long-time anchor John Drury. Magers has appeared in a feature segment and was a commentator on The Roe Conn Show on WLS (AM) since 1997, with a gap of several months in 2009/10 because of the bankruptcy of WLS's parent company. He was rehired following the station's sale. On May 25, 2016 Magers retired from ABC with a final late evening newscast with tributes from staff and colleagues. ABC7 anchor Alan Krashesky succeeded Magers at 5:00 p.m. alongside Cheryl Burton and alongside Kathy Brock at 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. Awards Magers has won numerous awards including six Chicago Emmy Awards, a Peter Lisagor Award and a National Press Club citation.

It is currently based at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms. Consisting of approximately 1,000 Marines, it is part of the 1st Marine Division. Famous Marines who have served in 1/7 include General Raymond G. Davis, General James Mattis, Lieutenant General Lewis \\"Chesty\\" Puller, and Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone. Subordinate units * Headquarters and Service Company * Alpha Company * Baker Company * Charley Company * Weapons Company History The 1st Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment was created on 1 April 1921 in San Diego, California. In September 1924, the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines was deactivated with its personnel being absorbed by the newly organized 4th Marine Regiment. For the next twenty years 1/7 was activated, re-designated, and disbanded on numerous occasions until being reborn on 1 January 1941. World War II Just over a year after its rebirth, 1/7 deployed to take part in the Pacific Theater during World War II, where its personnel as part of the 1st Marine Division, saw their first action of the war at Guadalcanal. Under its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Lewis B. \\"Chesty\\" Puller, the Battalion distinguished itself many times over for valor, and bravery held its positions against the onslaught of a regiment of seasoned Japanese attackers. It was also during this campaign that the legendary Sgt \\"Manila John\\" Basilone of the Battalion was awarded the Medal of Honor for defending the regiment from a comprehensive Japanese assault using only a machine gun. Throughout the remainder of the war, the \\"First Team\\" distinguished itself throughout many campaigns, including the Battle of Cape Gloucester, the Battle of Peleliu and the Battle of Okinawa. At the end of the war in the Pacific, 1/7 deployed to North China for occupation duty. Korean War Following World War II, the \\"First of the Seventh\\" was sent to Camp Pendleton in California where it was deactivated on 5 March 1947. However, in response to the invasion of South Korea by the communist North Korea, the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines was again called into action. On 21 September 1950, 1/7 carried out an amphibious landing at Inchon. Once more the \\"First Team\\" distinguished itself in battle fighting its way to and from the Chosin Reservoir and in the First Battle of the Hook; Lt Col Raymond C. Davis of the Battalion received the Medal of Honor for fighting at the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. Following the cessation of hostilities in Korea and through 1965, 1/7 spent time both in Camp Pendleton and Okinawa while maintaining its combat readiness. Vietnam War In August 1965, 1/7 was once again called to service, this time in the Republic of Vietnam. The 1/7 commander, Lt. Colonel James P. Kelly, led the \\"First Team\\" in 1965-1966 as they participated in numerous combat operations such as 'Starlite', Piranha', 'Mameluke Thrust' and 'Oklahoma Hills'. During these operations and many others, 1/7 was honored repeatedly, earning the Presidential Unit Citation Streamer four times and the Meritorious Unit Commendation Streamer three times. Corporal Larry Eugene Smedley, Delta Company /1/7, was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for action that took place on Dec. 20, 1967 and Private First Class Ralph Dias, Delta Company, 1/7, was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for action that took place in November 1969. In 1998, Robert R. Ingram was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Bill Clinton for his actions on March 28, 1966 while he was assigned as a Navy hospital corpsman in B Company, 1/7. Five Marines from 1/7 were responsible for the only war crime brought to charge against the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War. On 19 February 1970, in the Son Thang massacre just southwest of Danang, a five-man patrol from the Battalion executed five women and eleven children. One member of the team was convicted of premeditated murder, but had served less than a year in prisonWarren, \\"American Spartans\\", p. 350 Gulf War The 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, was the first unit to man defensive positions in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield in August 1990. The Battalion was an integral member of Task Force Ripper. As Desert Shield became Desert Storm, 1/7 participated in the diagonal thrust to the perimeter of Kuwait City, spearheading the liberation of Kuwait from Iraq. 1/7 returned to Twentynine Palms in California, in March 1991. Somalia On 11 December 1992, the first elements of 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, arrived at Mogadishu, Somalia for Operation Restore Hope. 1/7 operations were conducted in Baidoa, Bardera, Oddur, Afgoye and Mogadishu. The Battalion relieved Task Force Mogadishu for occupation of the Stadium Complex in Mogadishu on 25 January 1993. The following night, Lance Corporal Anthony Botello was killed by a sniper while on night patrol in the city. Bottelo was the only other Marine besides Pfc. Domingo Arroyo (3rd Battalion 11th Marines) to be killed in action in Somalia. 1/7 turned over their mission and area of operations in Mogadishu to the 10th Baluch Battalion on 24 April 1993 and returned to Twentynine Palms. Operation Iraqi Freedom Marines from C Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, enter a palace in Baghdad 1/7 Marines in 2010 In January 2003, 1/7 was deployed on Operation Iraqi Freedom. It crossed the Kuwaiti border into Iraq on 18 March; its first mission was to seize the strategically prominent oil pumping and control station in Az Zubayr. This station was so important because more than 50% of Iraq's oil was controlled by it.Gordon (2006), p.220-21. 1/7 saw significant combat action on its way to Baghdad and in the streets of the Iraqi capital. On 23 April, 1/7 turned over control of their sector to the U.S. Army and took up positions in the city of An Najaf. After countless extensions, the Battalion returned to Twentynine Palms, on 5 October 2003. In August 2004, 1/7 deployed once more, but this time to Western Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom II. There the Battalion conducted security operations in the cities and roadways along the Euphrates River and Syrian border to include Husaybah, Karabilah, Sadah, Ubaydi, Al Qa'im, Haditha, Hit and Haqlania. Involved in combat operations on a daily basis, 1/7 personnel conducted mounted and dismounted urban patrols, cordon knocks, Main Supply Route (MSR) security, sweep operations, and border security to clear the battalion's Area of Operation (AO) of enemy insurgents. In March 2006, 1/7 again deployed to Iraq and operated near the Iraqi-Syrian border, conducting dismounted urban patrols, weapons cache sweeping and vehicle checkpoints. It returned in September 2006. 1/7 returned to Western Al Anbar in August 2007. Assigned to AO Hīt, \\"Task Force 1/7\\" conducted thousands of combat patrols and weapon cache sweeps. TF 1/7 found over 22,000 pieces of ordnance during the deployment and captured over 200 suspected terrorists and criminals. TF 1/7 was partnered with two Iraqi infantry battalions and two police districts. The training and development of the Iraqi units was so successful that the city of Hit was the first city within the Al Anbar Province to be returned to Iraqi control. The Battalion returned to Twentynine Palms in March 2008. In February 2009, 1/7 returned to the Al Anbar province. Assigned to Fallujah and Al-Karmah, it was tasked to maintain security in the area with close cooperation with Iraqi police, the Iraqi Army and Provincial Security Forces. Upon departing the region in August and September 2009, 1/7 turned over the AO to Iraqi control before returning to the United States. Operation Enduring Freedom In March 2012, the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines deployed to Sangin District, Helmand Province, Afghanistan to conduct counterinsurgency operations and support the transition of authority from U.S. forces to the Afghan National Security Forces. The Battalion returned in October 2012. 1/7 Marines patrol through a field in Sangin district, April 2012. Marines with Weapons Company, 1/7, land during a mission in Helmand province, Afghanistan, 28 April 2014. In March 2014, 1/7 again deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The Battalion retrograded from Sangin district on 5 May 2014, and turned over security responsibility of the area to the Afghan National Army. 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, was the final Marine Corps unit to occupy FOB Sabit Qadam and the surrounding area in Sangin District.http://www.marines.mil/Photos.aspx?igphoto=2000795558 During the Battalion’s approximately seven-month-long deployment, the \\"First Team\\" was responsible for a number of successful missions throughout Helmand province. \\"They should be proud of what they contributed to the campaign,\\" said Brig. Gen. Daniel Yoo. \\"They have been involved in everything from the northern Helmand retrograde from Sangin, which was historic for the Marine Corps but also for 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, because of their previous deployment there. They were involved in the central Helmand liftoff to support our U.K. brothers as they picked up and moved out of Lashkar Gah. They were involved in elections prep from both the primary elections and the runoff elections.\\" Unfortunately, amidst the battalion’s success came two devastating incidents. The first incident occurred while providing security, 25 June, when Sgt. Thomas Spitzer, a Scout Sniper assigned to the Scout Sniper Platoon, was killed in action. The second occurred during a dismounted combat patrol, 9 Aug., when Staff Sgt. Brandon Dodson, a platoon sergeant with Baker Co., stepped on an improvised explosive device. Dodson was severely injured, but he maintains a positive attitude and is committed toward his recovery at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. On 1 October 2014, the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, transferred their area of responsibility to 3rd Squadron, 3rd Cavalry Regiment, a U.S. Army command based out of Fort Hood, Texas.

It is written in a unique cadenced style, in which a mysterious prince must complete a seemingly impossible task to free a maiden from the clutches of an evil duke. It invokes many fairy tale motifs.Brian Attebery, The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature, p 148, The story is noted for Thurber's constant, complex wordplay, and his use of an almost continuous internal meter, with occasional hidden rhymes — akin to blank verse, but with no line breaks to advertise the structure. Other fantasy books by Thurber, such as Many Moons, The Wonderful O (published 1958), and particularly The White Deer, also contained hints of this unusual prose form, but here it becomes a universal feature of the text, to the point where it is possible to predict the word order for a given phrase (for example, \\"the Golux said\\" vs. \\"said the Golux\\") by looking at the pattern of emphasis in the preceding phrase. By the time he wrote this book, Thurber was blind, so he could not draw cartoons for the book, as he had done with The White Deer five years earlier. He enlisted his friend Marc Simont to illustrate the original edition. The Golux is said to wear an \\"indescribable hat\\". Thurber made Simont describe all his illustrations, and was satisfied when Simont was unable to describe the hat. When it was reissued by Puffin Books, it was illustrated by Ronald Searle. The book has been reprinted by The New York Review Children's Collection, with original illustrations by Marc Simont and an introduction by Neil Gaiman.James Thurber, The 13 Clocks, Plot summary The evil Duke of Coffin Castle lives with his good and beautiful niece, the princess Saralinda, in a castle so cold that all the clocks have frozen at ten minutes to five. Several suitors have tried to court the Princess, but the Duke's policy is to test their eligibility by assigning them impossible tasks. A few days before Saralinda's twenty-first birthday, Prince Zorn of Zorna arrives in the town disguised as a minstrel. He falls in with an enigmatic guide known as the Golux. Soon after, he is arrested for singing mocking songs about the Duke in public. The Duke learns \\"Xingu\\"'s true identity, and decides to allow him to court Saralinda. The Duke assigns Zorn the task of finding a thousand jewels, and sets a deadline 99 hours hence, which is too little time for Zorn to obtain the jewels from the kingdom of Zorna. In addition, the Duke demands that Zorn must also find a way to restart the thirteen frozen clocks. Zorn and the Golux travel to the home of Hagga, a woman who had been given the magical ability to weep jewels rather than tears. She tells them that she has wept so much, in order to provide jewels for others, that she can no longer weep from sadness; the only time she weeps is when she weeps from laughing. She adds that such jewels, produced by weeping with laughter, will turn back into tears a fortnight (fourteen days) later. Undeterred by this, the Golux and Zorn obtain a thousand of these short-lived jewels of laughter from her. The Prince and Golux return to the castle, with the jewels. With the help of Saralinda, the Golux finds a way to restart the clocks as required. Presented with the thousand jewels and the sound of the thirteen clocks striking, the Duke is forced to admit defeat. Zorn and the Princess happily depart by ship, first to the kingdom of Yarrow (where Saralinda's father lives) and then on to the Prince's homeland of Zorna. A fortnight later, while the Duke is gloating over his jewels, they transform back into tears. The angry Duke, deprived of his vengeance and his profit, is then killed by a nightmarish monster called the Todal, sent by the Devil as punishment for failing to do sufficient evil. Reception Boucher and McComas praised the book as \\"magically adorned with touches of modern humor, hints of dark Jacobean terror, and gleams of pure poetry.\\".\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, April 1951, p.113 The USA's Common Core State Standards Initiative includes The 13 Clocks as a text exemplar for second and third grades. Stage, film and audio The story was set to music by Mark Bucci and appeared in 1953 as the 5th episode of The Motorola Television Hour, with Basil Rathbone as the evil Duke. It was also adapted and produced by Stephen Teeter for use in the 1960s in a production in Berkeley, CA. Later it was adapted and produced by Frank Lowe for stage, and published in 1976 by Samuel French, Inc . In 1968, Warner Bros. hired producer Mervyn LeRoy to make a film of The 13 Clocks, and the Sherman Brothers wrote a score. The project was cancelled; the score was released on the \\"Unsung Sherman Brothers\\" CD. Audio recordings have also been produced, performed by Lauren Bacall (Pathways of Sound, POS 1039 & 1040), Peter Ustinov (Caedmon Audio, ) and Edward Woodward (Phoenix Audio, ). The BBC produced a radio version of the story in December 1973, with Heron Carvic as the Golux and Nigel Lambert as Prince Zorn. A three part Jackanory adaptation was broadcast on BBC One 28–30 December 1983 starring Colin Jeavons as the Duke, Roy Kinnear as the Golux, Yolande Palfrey as Saralinda and Simon Shepherd as Prince Zorn.

The work is divided into four movements: # Largo – Allegro # Largo # Allegretto grazioso # Hornpipe Circumstances The Concerto was written in the summer of 1933. In May of that year Schoenberg had been forced to flee Berlin after the accession of the Nazi Party. He first went to Paris (where he reconverted from Lutheranism to the Judaism of his childhood). He spent the summer of 1933 with his wife and infant daughter in the French town of Arcachon, a seaside resort near Bordeaux, completing the Concerto there before leaving for permanent residence in America in October. The work was first performed on September 26, 1934 in Prague with the Kolisch Quartet as soloists. The music Schoenberg wrote of the work: \\"I was mainly intent on removing the defects of the Handelian style. Just as Mozart did with Handel's Messiah, I have had to get rid of whole handfuls of rosalias and sequences, replacing them with real substance. I also did my best to deal with the other main defect of the Handelian style, which is that the theme is always best when it first appears and grows steadily more insignificant and trivial in the course of the piece\\".Arnold Schoenberg Letters Similar works Other works for string quartet and orchestra have been written by John Adams, Morton Feldman, Mehdi Hosseini,Tehran Times Benjamin Lees, Bohuslav Martinů, Emmanuel Nunes, Julián Orbón, Gunther Schuller, Louis Spohr, and Julia Wolfe, while concertos for string quartet and wind orchestra have been written by Walter Piston, Joel Puckett, and Erwin Schulhoff.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1992. The Cessna 335 is an unpressurized version, which appears the same externally as the 340. It sold in fewer numbers than the 340. Design and development The 340 was conceived as a cabin-class development of the successful Cessna 310. The 340 is a six-seat aircraft, with four passenger seats, an aisle and an airstair door. The tail and landing gear were based on the Cessna 310's units, while its wings were from the Cessna 414. The 340's primary selling feature was its spacious, pressurized cabin, the first in a light twin. Work on the 340 began in 1969, and the first aircraft was delivered in 1971, behind schedule because one of the prototypes crashed during flight testing in 1970. The early models have two turbocharged Continental TSIO-520-K engines with 285 hp (214 kW) each. Starting in 1976, the engines were upgraded to the more powerful Continental TSIO-520-NB engines of 310 hp (233 kW). This variant is known as the 340A and it also features smaller diameter propellers to reduce noise and meet ICAO Annex 16 noise requirements. The Cessna 335 was marketed as a low-priced, non-pressurized, version powered by 300 hp (225 kW) Continental TSIO-520-EB engines. The prototype 335 made its maiden flight on December 5, 1978, with the first production aircraft flying in 1979.Taylor 1980, pp. 318–319. It was not a market success, with only 64 built by the time production ended in 1980. The 340 was more successful and remained in production until 1984 with 1287 built.

That is, it is a model that is used to predict the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of a categorically distributed dependent variable, given a set of independent variables (which may be real-valued, binary-valued, categorical-valued, etc.). Multinomial logistic regression is known by a variety of other names, including polytomous LR, multiclass LR, softmax regression, multinomial logit (mlogit), the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) classifier, and the conditional maximum entropy model. Background Multinomial logistic regression is used when the dependent variable in question is nominal (equivalently categorical, meaning that it falls into any one of a set of categories that cannot be ordered in any meaningful way) and for which there are more than two categories. Some examples would be: *Which major will a college student choose, given their grades, stated likes and dislikes, etc.? *Which blood type does a person have, given the results of various diagnostic tests? *In a hands-free mobile phone dialing application, which person's name was spoken, given various properties of the speech signal? *Which candidate will a person vote for, given particular demographic characteristics? *Which country will a firm locate an office in, given the characteristics of the firm and of the various candidate countries? These are all statistical classification problems. They all have in common a dependent variable to be predicted that comes from one of a limited set of items that cannot be meaningfully ordered, as well as a set of independent variables (also known as features, explanators, etc.), which are used to predict the dependent variable. Multinomial logistic regression is a particular solution to classification problems that use a linear combination of the observed features and some problem-specific parameters to estimate the probability of each particular value of the dependent variable. The best values of the parameters for a given problem are usually determined from some training data (e.g. some people for whom both the diagnostic test results and blood types are known, or some examples of known words being spoken). Assumptions The multinomial logistic model assumes that data are case specific; that is, each independent variable has a single value for each case. The multinomial logistic model also assumes that the dependent variable cannot be perfectly predicted from the independent variables for any case. As with other types of regression, there is no need for the independent variables to be statistically independent from each other (unlike, for example, in a naive Bayes classifier); however, collinearity is assumed to be relatively low, as it becomes difficult to differentiate between the impact of several variables if this is not the case. If the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it relies on the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), which is not always desirable. This assumption states that the odds of preferring one class over another do not depend on the presence or absence of other \\"irrelevant\\" alternatives. For example, the relative probabilities of taking a car or bus to work do not change if a bicycle is added as an additional possibility. This allows the choice of K alternatives to be modeled as a set of K-1 independent binary choices, in which one alternative is chosen as a \\"pivot\\" and the other K-1 compared against it, one at a time. The IIA hypothesis is a core hypothesis in rational choice theory; however numerous studies in psychology show that individuals often violate this assumption when making choices. An example of a problem case arises if choices include a car and a blue bus. Suppose the odds ratio between the two is 1 : 1. Now if the option of a red bus is introduced, a person may be indifferent between a red and a blue bus, and hence may exhibit a car : blue bus : red bus odds ratio of 1 : 0.5 : 0.5, thus maintaining a 1 : 1 ratio of car : any bus while adopting a changed car : blue bus ratio of 1 : 0.5. Here the red bus option was not in fact irrelevant, because a red bus was a perfect substitute for a blue bus. If the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it may in some situations impose too much constraint on the relative preferences between the different alternatives. This point is especially important to take into account if the analysis aims to predict how choices would change if one alternative was to disappear (for instance if one political candidate withdraws from a three candidate race). Other models like the nested logit or the multinomial probit may be used in such cases as they allow for violation of the IIA. Model=Introduction There are multiple equivalent ways to describe the mathematical model underlying multinomial logistic regression. This can make it difficult to compare different treatments of the subject in different texts. The article on logistic regression presents a number of equivalent formulations of simple logistic regression, and many of these have analogues in the multinomial logit model. The idea behind all of them, as in many other statistical classification techniques, is to construct a linear predictor function that constructs a score from a set of weights that are linearly combined with the explanatory variables (features) of a given observation using a dot product: :\\\\operatorname{score}(\\\\mathbf{X}_i,k) = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i, where Xi is the vector of explanatory variables describing observation i, βk is a vector of weights (or regression coefficients) corresponding to outcome k, and score(Xi, k) is the score associated with assigning observation i to category k. In discrete choice theory, where observations represent people and outcomes represent choices, the score is considered the utility associated with person i choosing outcome k. The predicted outcome is the one with the highest score. The difference between the multinomial logit model and numerous other methods, models, algorithms, etc. with the same basic setup (the perceptron algorithm, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, etc.) is the procedure for determining (training) the optimal weights/coefficients and the way that the score is interpreted. In particular, in the multinomial logit model, the score can directly be converted to a probability value, indicating the probability of observation i choosing outcome k given the measured characteristics of the observation. This provides a principled way of incorporating the prediction of a particular multinomial logit model into a larger procedure that may involve multiple such predictions, each with a possibility of error. Without such means of combining predictions, errors tend to multiply. For example, imagine a large predictive model that is broken down into a series of submodels where the prediction of a given submodel is used as the input of another submodel, and that prediction is in turn used as the input into a third submodel, etc. If each submodel has 90% accuracy in its predictions, and there are five submodels in series, then the overall model has only 0.95 = 59% accuracy. If each submodel has 80% accuracy, then overall accuracy drops to 0.85 = 33% accuracy. This issue is known as error propagation and is a serious problem in real-world predictive models, which are usually composed of numerous parts. Predicting probabilities of each possible outcome, rather than simply making a single optimal prediction, is one means of alleviating this issue. Setup The basic setup is the same as in logistic regression, the only difference being that the dependent variables are categorical rather than binary, i.e. there are K possible outcomes rather than just two. The following description is somewhat shortened; for more details, consult the logistic regression article. =Data points= Specifically, it is assumed that we have a series of N observed data points. Each data point i (ranging from 1 to N) consists of a set of M explanatory variables x1,i ... xM,i (aka independent variables, predictor variables, features, etc.), and an associated categorical outcome Yi (aka dependent variable, response variable), which can take on one of K possible values. These possible values represent logically separate categories (e.g. different political parties, blood types, etc.), and are often described mathematically by arbitrarily assigning each a number from 1 to K. The explanatory variables and outcome represent observed properties of the data points, and are often thought of as originating in the observations of N \\"experiments\\" — although an \\"experiment\\" may consist in nothing more than gathering data. The goal of multinomial logistic regression is to construct a model that explains the relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome, so that the outcome of a new \\"experiment\\" can be correctly predicted for a new data point for which the explanatory variables, but not the outcome, are available. In the process, the model attempts to explain the relative effect of differing explanatory variables on the outcome. Some examples: *The observed outcomes are different variants of a disease such as hepatitis (possibly including \\"no disease\\" and/or other related diseases) in a set of patients, and the explanatory variables might be characteristics of the patients thought to be pertinent (sex, race, age, blood pressure, outcomes of various liver-function tests, etc.). The goal is then to predict which disease is causing the observed liver-related symptoms in a new patient. *The observed outcomes are the party chosen by a set of people in an election, and the explanatory variables are the demographic characteristics of each person (e.g. sex, race, age, income, etc.). The goal is then to predict the likely vote of a new voter with given characteristics. =Linear predictor= As in other forms of linear regression, multinomial logistic regression uses a linear predictor function f(k,i) to predict the probability that observation i has outcome k, of the following form: :f(k,i) = \\\\beta_{0,k} + \\\\beta_{1,k} x_{1,i} + \\\\beta_{2,k} x_{2,i} + \\\\cdots + \\\\beta_{M,k} x_{M,i}, where \\\\beta_{m,k} is a regression coefficient associated with the mth explanatory variable and the kth outcome. As explained in the logistic regression article, the regression coefficients and explanatory variables are normally grouped into vectors of size M+1, so that the predictor function can be written more compactly: :f(k,i) = \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_i, where \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k is the set of regression coefficients associated with outcome k, and \\\\mathbf{x}_i (a row vector) is the set of explanatory variables associated with observation i. As a set of independent binary regressions To arrive at the multinomial logit model, one can imagine, for K possible outcomes, running K-1 independent binary logistic regression models, in which one outcome is chosen as a \\"pivot\\" and then the other K-1 outcomes are separately regressed against the pivot outcome. This would proceed as follows, if outcome K (the last outcome) is chosen as the pivot: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(Y_i=1)}{\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i \\\\ \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(Y_i=2)}{\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\Pr(Y_i=K-1)}{\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_{K-1} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i \\\\ \\\\end{align} Note that we have introduced separate sets of regression coefficients, one for each possible outcome. If we exponentiate both sides, and solve for the probabilities, we get: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= {\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= {\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= {\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_{K-1} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\ \\\\end{align} Using the fact that all K of the probabilities must sum to one, we find: :\\\\Pr(Y_i=K) = 1- \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \\\\Pr (Y_i = k) = 1 - \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}{\\\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\Pr(Y_i=K) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} We can use this to find the other probabilities: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_{K-1} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\ \\\\end{align} The fact that we run multiple regressions reveals why the model relies on the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives described above. Estimating the coefficients The unknown parameters in each vector βk are typically jointly estimated by maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, which is an extension of maximum likelihood using regularization of the weights to prevent pathological solutions (usually a squared regularizing function, which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution on the weights, but other distributions are also possible). The solution is typically found using an iterative procedure such as generalized iterative scaling, iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS), by means of gradient-based optimization algorithms such as L-BFGS, or by specialized coordinate descent algorithms. As a log-linear model The formulation of binary logistic regression as a log-linear model can be directly extended to multi-way regression. That is, we model the logarithm of the probability of seeing a given output using the linear predictor as well as an additional normalization factor, the logarithm of the partition function: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\ln \\\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i - \\\\ln Z \\\\, \\\\ \\\\ln \\\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i - \\\\ln Z \\\\, \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\ln \\\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i - \\\\ln Z \\\\, \\\\ \\\\end{align} As in the binary case, we need an extra term \\\\- \\\\ln Z to ensure that the whole set of probabilities forms a probability distribution, i.e. so that they all sum to one: :\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\Pr(Y_i=k) = 1 The reason why we need to add a term to ensure normalization, rather than multiply as is usual, is because we have taken the logarithm of the probabilities. Exponentiating both sides turns the additive term into a multiplicative factor, so that the probability is just the Gibbs measure: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\end{align} The quantity Z is called the partition function for the distribution. We can compute the value of the partition function by applying the above constraint that requires all probabilities to sum to 1: : \\\\begin{align} 1 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\Pr(Y_i=k) &= \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{Z} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\ \\\\end{align} Therefore: :Z = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} Note that this factor is \\"constant\\" in the sense that it is not a function of Yi, which is the variable over which the probability distribution is defined. However, it is definitely not constant with respect to the explanatory variables, or crucially, with respect to the unknown regression coefficients βk, which we will need to determine through some sort of optimization procedure. The resulting equations for the probabilities are : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\end{align} Or generally: :\\\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_c \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} The following function: :\\\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\frac{e^{x_k}}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}} is referred to as the softmax function. The reason is that the effect of exponentiating the values x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n is to exaggerate the differences between them. As a result, \\\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) will return a value close to 0 whenever x_k is significantly less than the maximum of all the values, and will return a value close to 1 when applied to the maximum value, unless it is extremely close to the next-largest value. Thus, the softmax function can be used to construct a weighted average that behaves as a smooth function (which can be conveniently differentiated, etc.) and which approximates the indicator function :f(k) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 \\\\; \\\\textrm{ if } \\\\; k = \\\\operatorname{\\\\arg\\\\max}(x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), \\\\ 0 \\\\; \\\\textrm{ otherwise}. \\\\end{cases} Thus, we can write the probability equations as :\\\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\\\operatorname{softmax}(c, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i, \\\\ldots, \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i) The softmax function thus serves as the equivalent of the logistic function in binary logistic regression. Note that not all of the \\\\beta_k vectors of coefficients are uniquely identifiable. This is due to the fact that all probabilities must sum to 1, making one of them completely determined once all the rest are known. As a result, there are only k-1 separately specifiable probabilities, and hence k-1 separately identifiable vectors of coefficients. One way to see this is to note that if we add a constant vector to all of the coefficient vectors, the equations are identical: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{e^{(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_c + C) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k + C) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_c \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\ &= \\\\frac{e^{C \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_c \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{C \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\ &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_c \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\end{align} As a result, it is conventional to set C = -\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K (or alternatively, one of the other coefficient vectors). Essentially, we set the constant so that one of the vectors becomes 0, and all of the other vectors get transformed into the difference between those vectors and the vector we chose. This is equivalent to \\"pivoting\\" around one of the K choices, and examining how much better or worse all of the other K-1 choices are, relative to the choice we are pivoting around. Mathematically, we transform the coefficients as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_1 &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 - \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_{K-1} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_{K-1} - \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\ \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_K &= 0 \\\\end{align} This leads to the following equations: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\\\frac{e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_{K-1} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta'_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\, \\\\ \\\\end{align} Other than the prime symbols on the regression coefficients, this is exactly the same as the form of the model described above, in terms of K-1 independent two-way regressions. As a latent- variable model It is also possible to formulate multinomial logistic regression as a latent variable model, following the two-way latent variable model described for binary logistic regression. This formulation is common in the theory of discrete choice models, and makes it easier to compare multinomial logistic regression to the related multinomial probit model, as well as to extend it to more complex models. Imagine that, for each data point i and possible outcome k=1,2,...,K, there is a continuous latent variable Yi,k* (i.e. an unobserved random variable) that is distributed as follows: : \\\\begin{align} Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i + \\\\varepsilon_1 \\\\, \\\\ Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_2 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i + \\\\varepsilon_2 \\\\, \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\ Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast} &= \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_K \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i + \\\\varepsilon_K \\\\, \\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\varepsilon_k \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{EV}_1(0,1), i.e. a standard type-1 extreme value distribution. This latent variable can be thought of as the utility associated with data point i choosing outcome k, where there is some randomness in the actual amount of utility obtained, which accounts for other unmodeled factors that go into the choice. The value of the actual variable Y_i is then determined in a non-random fashion from these latent variables (i.e. the randomness has been moved from the observed outcomes into the latent variables), where outcome k is chosen if and only if the associated utility (the value of Y_{i,k}^{\\\\ast}) is greater than the utilities of all the other choices, i.e. if the utility associated with outcome k is the maximum of all the utilities. Since the latent variables are continuous, the probability of two having exactly the same value is 0, so we ignore the scenario. That is: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\\\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast} \\\\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\\\ast}\\\\text{ and } \\\\cdots \\\\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\\\Pr(Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} \\\\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\\\ast}\\\\text{ and } \\\\cdots \\\\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\\\Pr(Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} \\\\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast}\\\\text{ and } \\\\cdots \\\\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,K-1}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\ \\\\end{align} Or equivalently: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\\\Pr(\\\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast},\\\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast})=Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\\\Pr(\\\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast},\\\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast})=Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\ \\\\cdots & \\\\ \\\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\\\Pr(\\\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\\\ast},\\\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast})=Y_{i,K}^{\\\\ast}) \\\\ \\\\end{align} Let's look more closely at the first equation, which we can write as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\\\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} > Y_{i,k}^{\\\\ast}\\\\ \\\\forall\\\\ k=2,\\\\ldots,K) \\\\ &= \\\\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\\\ast} - Y_{i,k}^{\\\\ast} > 0\\\\ \\\\forall\\\\ k=2,\\\\ldots,K) \\\\ &= \\\\Pr(\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i + \\\\varepsilon_1 - (\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i + \\\\varepsilon_k) > 0\\\\ \\\\forall\\\\ k=2,\\\\ldots,K) \\\\ &= \\\\Pr((\\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_1 - \\\\boldsymbol\\\\beta_k) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{X}_i > \\\\varepsilon_k - \\\\varepsilon_1\\\\ \\\\forall\\\\ k=2,\\\\ldots,K) \\\\end{align} There are a few things to realize here: #In general, if X \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b) and Y \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b) then X - Y \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b). That is, the difference of two independent identically distributed extreme-value- distributed variables follows the logistic distribution, where the first parameter is unimportant. This is understandable since the first parameter is a location parameter, i.e. it shifts the mean by a fixed amount, and if two values are both shifted by the same amount, their difference remains the same. This means that all of the relational statements underlying the probability of a given choice involve the logistic distribution, which makes the initial choice of the extreme-value distribution, which seemed rather arbitrary, somewhat more understandable. #The second parameter in an extreme-value or logistic distribution is a scale parameter, such that if X \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Logistic}(0,1) then bX \\\\sim \\\\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b). This means that the effect of using an error variable with an arbitrary scale parameter in place of scale 1 can be compensated simply by multiplying all regression vectors by the same scale. Together with the previous point, this shows that the use of a standard extreme-value distribution (location 0, scale 1) for the error variables entails no loss of generality over using an arbitrary extreme-value distribution. In fact, the model is nonidentifiable (no single set of optimal coefficients) if the more general distribution is used. #Because only differences of vectors of regression coefficients are used, adding an arbitrary constant to all coefficient vectors has no effect on the model. This means that, just as in the log-linear model, only K-1 of the coefficient vectors are identifiable, and the last one can be set to an arbitrary value (e.g. 0). Actually finding the values of the above probabilities is somewhat difficult, and is a problem of computing a particular order statistic (the first, i.e. maximum) of a set of values. However, it can be shown that the resulting expressions are the same as in above formulations, i.e. the two are equivalent. Estimation of intercept When using multinomial logistic regression, one category of the dependent variable is chosen as the reference category. Separate odds ratios are determined for all independent variables for each category of the dependent variable with the exception of the reference category, which is omitted from the analysis. The exponential beta coefficient represents the change in the odds of the dependent variable being in a particular category vis-a-vis the reference category, associated with a one unit change of the corresponding independent variable. Application in natural language processing In natural language processing, multinomial LR classifiers are commonly used as an alternative to naive Bayes classifiers because they do not assume statistical independence of the random variables (commonly known as features) that serve as predictors. However, learning in such a model is slower than for a naive Bayes classifier, and thus may not be appropriate given a very large number of classes to learn. In particular, learning in a Naive Bayes classifier is a simple matter of counting up the number of co-occurrences of features and classes, while in a maximum entropy classifier the weights, which are typically maximized using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, must be learned using an iterative procedure; see #Estimating the coefficients.

The $6.9 million roadway replaced a former two-lane roadway through the former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base with funding from the city of Myrtle Beach funds and Horry County RIDE funds. Farrow Parkway is named after Lt. William Farrow who was a member of the Doolittle’s Raiders in World War II. History After the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base closed, the base redevelopment authority planned to sell bonds to build the main road through the former base in November 2000, with plans to start construction in January 2001. Work was expected to take 18 months.Zane Wilson, \\"Demolition Begins on Former Base,\\" The Sun News, August 25, 2000. Phase two of the road's construction started in November 2003.Erin Reed, \\"Detours May Be Gone by November,\\" The Sun News, October 20, 2003. On August 1, 2005, Farrow Parkway officially opened, a \\"four-lane, landscaped road with sidewalks, street lamps and a grassy median\\" three and a half miles long, between Kings Highway near Springmaid Beach and U.S. 17 Bypass.Emma Ritch, \\"MB Opens Farrow Parkway,\\" The Sun News, August 2, 2005. Development along the Parkway includes The Market Common.\\"Stores, eateries gear up for opening,\\" The Sun News, March 5, 2008. The intersection of Farrow Parkway and South Carolina Highway 707 with U.S. Highway 17, known as the \\"back gate\\" of the former base, has seen increased traffic with the construction of The Market Common, expansion of the Myrtle Beach International Airport and other development on and near the former base. One of the first priorities for Horry County's program 'Riding on a Penny' was to build a grade-separated interchange connecting the two roads together. The projected cost of the project was $49,500,000. The recommended configuration of the interchange, due to limiting right-of-way space and heavy traffic demands, is a single-point urban interchange.Handout on the interchange project from Horry County http://www.ridingonapenny.com/handout-060608.pdf Also, U.S. 17 must go over a 35-foot-high, 1,200-foot-long bridge because the soil cannot support a stronger bridge without work that would have delayed the project.Mike Cherney, \\"Traffic relief on schedule: Longer-than-expected overpass likely to push project past $50 million mark,\\" The Sun News, June 5, 2008. As of April 2010, the projected cost had more than doubled to $107 million.Lorena Anderson, \\"Myrtle Beach wary as back gate overpass gets under way,\\" The Sun News, April 17, 2010. Interchange construction began June 6, 2011, and the projected completion date was August 2014. Soil conditions and weather caused many delays. On October 23, 2014, a ribbon cutting took place for the completion of what became a $121.7 million project. The southbound lanes opened earlier that week, and the northbound lanes were opening the next week. Pavement markings, signs and other details would not be complete until November. The project also included more turn lanes on U.S. 17, frontage roads, and the addition of Coventry Boulevard as an alternate route around the interchange.
