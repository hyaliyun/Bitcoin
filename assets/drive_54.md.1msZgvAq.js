The population was 3,778 at the 2010 census. History Rockland Township was organized in 1758. Prior to that it was a part of Oley. It took its name from the numerous rocks it contains. Boulders thirty feet long, fifteen feet wide and fifteen feet high may be seen. Certain collections of rocks are known as Shott's Head and Guinther's Head. Near the latter there is a succession of rocks one hundred twenty feet long. This is the watershed of the township and from this point the water is drained south, east and west.A. E. Wagner, Ph.D., F. W. Balthaser, M.E., and D.K. Hoch, The Story of Berks County Pennsylvania, Eagle Book ad Job Press, Reading, 1913 The early settlers were Germans, who migrated northward from Oley. In 1842 a part of this township was taken and annexed to Pike. Sacony and Beaver Creeks have for many years turned mills of various kinds. Grim's mill on the Sacony has been remodeled recently and now does the grinding by an up-to-date process. Rohrbach's mill was destroyed by fire some time ago, and has not been rebuilt. Roth's mill is near Dryville and Keller's in the western part of the township. On the Sacony was also located the \\"Sally Ann\\" charcoal furnace. It was built in 1811, and was operated until 1879. The Rockland Forges were operated for more than seventy years. General Daniel Udree operated one with Hessians and Redemptioners. On Beaver Creek was manufactured paper and birch oil. A kind of clay has been found from which chinaware is made. A pottery was also operated in the vicinity. A granite, very much like Vermont granite, is found near New Jerusalem. There is a marble saw mill on the Sacony near Grim's mill, where large blocks of marble are sawed into desirable sizes. It has been in operation since 1864. None of the early mines are now in operation. The Sally Ann Furnace Complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

It is perhaps best known for being the location of the homestead to Pennsylvania's first governor, Thomas Mifflin, and as the childhood home of American author John Updike. Many of Updike's stories take place in Shillington and its environs. History Shillington began in 1860 as part of Cumru Township, when local landowner and borough namesake Samuel Shilling sold some of his lots for residences. The area had an inn, originally built in 1762, called the Three Mile House because it was from Reading on the Lancaster Pike. The inn was a popular stop for farmers going to the city's markets, and later it sat near a horse racing track built by Aaron Einstein in 1868. A post office opened in Shillington in 1884. On August 18, 1908, the Quarter Session Court officially incorporated the borough of Shillington as a separate municipality from Cumru Township with a population of 450. Later that year Shillington elected its first official, Adam Rollman, as chief burgess. Borough council meetings were held in various locations over the years until the present town hall was completed in 1932. Much of the borough's present land was occupied by Angelica Farm which would be established as an almshouse, or poorhouse, in 1824. The alms house was replaced by Bern Township's Berks Heim in 1952. The buildings of the Governor Mifflin School District now occupy most of land that was once part of the almshouse. Today, the most notable visible remnant of the poorhouse is a stone wall that is within short walking distance down the road from John Updike's old home. Updike's first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, is set in a fictional building based on Shillington's poorhouse. Angelica Farm was also the historical home of Thomas Mifflin, the first governor of Pennsylvania and 11th President of the Continental Congress.  Education  Shillington borough is home to Governor Mifflin School District. Within the Shillington borough there are 5 schools: Governor Mifflin Senior High School, Governor Mifflin Middle School, Governor Mifflin Intermediate School, Cumru Elementary School, and Mifflin Park Elementary.

The population was 27,119 at the 2010 census, making it the second most populous municipality in Berks County after the city of Reading. History In 1850, the Township of Cumru included about 33,000 acres of land with a population of 3,853 making it the most populous district in the county outside of Reading. In area, this was the largest township. In the decade before, two unsuccessful attempts were made to divide Cumru on account of its great extent. In 1850, a third attempt was made. The petition called for a division line situated to the west of the line requested in previous petitions, beginning at the ‚ÄúHarrisburg Bridge‚Äù and extending southward to the Lancaster County lines, at the corner of Brecknock Township, and it was inscribed by only 45 taxable inhabitants of the township. The court appointed Aaron Albright, Richard Boone and Michael K. Boyer as commissioners to inquire into advisability of the proposed division. The commissioners, after viewing Cumru Township, divided it and recommended the western part to be designated as a new township under the name of ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù. The name was derived from a large fresh water spring in the central portion of the area. Because of the limestone fissures under the ground, the spring periodically appeared and disappeared. The early settlers, who used it for their daily water supplies, referred to it as the ‚ÄúSinking Spring‚Äù. The Boundary lines of the township were described as enclosing some 15,000 acres. The report was presented for these boundaries on August 5, 1850. The Court confirmed the report on November 23, 1850 and formed the new township calling it the Township of Spring. Wertz's Covered Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 18.3 square miles (47.3 km2), of which, 18.2 square miles (47.2 km2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) of it (0.22%) is water. Since it is extensive from near the Schuylkill River in the NE to the Lancaster County border in the SW, its terrain varies considerably. Most is drained to the Schuylkill except for the SW end which is in the Susquehanna watershed and drains via the Conestoga River. While much of the north is low-lying, much of the SW is mountainous. The Cacoosing Creek forms the natural NW boundary and flows into the Tulpehocken Creek, which in turn forms the natural NE boundary.

History In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Wernersville was a noted resort community. City dwellers (especially from Philadelphia and New York City) traveled out to Wernersville (a stop on the Reading Railroad) to rest and partake of the cool mountain air of South Mountain. A number of large resort hotels were erected for this purpose including Galen Hall, Bynden Wood, Grand View and the Highland Hotel. Some were advertised as sanatoriums, specializing in rest cures for illnesses such as tuberculosis. The most famous of these was Dr. Robert Walter's Mountain Park (aka Walters Park). Most of these resort hotels have since disappeared due to fire, demolition, or have been transformed into buildings for institutional purposes. Some cottages once associated with the resorts are now private homes. In 1891, the Wernersville State Hospital opened as the State Asylum for the Chronic Insane. The original hospital buildings remain standing and the State Hospital is still active.

The name Wyomissing is from the Delaware language, meaning \\"the land of flats\\".Bright, William (2004). Native American Place Names of the United States. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 576 Much of Berks County was transferred from the Native Americans to William Penn in 1685. Title to the land that much of Wyomissing is built upon was in two parcels, an eastern tract and a western tract, which were divided by a northwesterly line in the vicinity of Lake Avenue. One of the earliest industries in the area was the Evans Grist Mill. This building still stands at the corner of Old Mill Road and Old Wyomissing Road. In 1896, present-day Wyomissing began to take form when Thomas P. Merritt (a Reading lumber dealer) acquired . Albert Thalheimer, David H. Keiser, Marthias Mengel, and Levi Walter Mengel joined Thomas R. Merrit in organizing the Reading Suburban Real Estate Company. Shortly afterwards Wyomissing Industries, manufacturer of textile machinery, was established by the firm of Thun & Janssen along the Reading Railroad just west of Van Reed Road (today named Park Road). Ferdinand Thun, Henry K Janssen, and Gustav Oberlaender became known as \\"The Big Three of Wyomissing Industries.Ferdinand Thun and Henry K Janssen were destined for shared success 16 January 2018 article in Reading Eagle Wyomissing Industries comprised Narrow Fabric Co., Textile Machine Works and Berkshire Knitting Mills. This spurred development, and soon there were many developers working to build Wyomissing. In 1904 and 1905, Thun and Janssen called town meetings to discuss setting up a borough government. Eventually petitions were filed with the courts for the establishment of a borough, signed by 61 resident property owners and 39 non-resident property owners. On July 2, 1906, the court issued the final decree of the incorporation of the Borough of Wyomissing. 1907 to present Between 1906 and the 1940s, several additional tracts of land were annexed to the borough from Spring and Cumru townships.

History In 1830, Tim Duncan, recognizing the excellent possibilities for land development, purchased land on the western banks of the stream which traversed the area and plotted a town, which he named Duncansville. About the same time Jacob Walters laid out plots of land on the eastern side of the stream and called his settlement Walterstown. Confusion and some rivalry existed between the two settlements. Both Duncan and Walters agreed that a common name should be used for the two places. They decided to cast lots to select the name to be used. The people of both settlements declared a holiday and arranged quite a celebration for the occasion. All assembled at the wooden bridge separating the two towns. A coin was tossed and fortune favored Duncan, thereby uniting the two communities under the name of Duncansville.

History During the late 18th century, Patrick Cassidy, a native of Newry, Ireland and an American soldier in the American Revolutionary War, purchased three hundred acres of land in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania. This is now known as Blair County. C. 1793, where he constructed a small town on the land, which he named for his home. A half-century later, Newry flourished as the Allegheny Portage Railroad began to carry passengers from Hollidaysburg across the Alleghenies to Johnstown. Newry's location made it a suitable stop for the railroad and this new influx of visitors stimulated the economy of the town. This prosperity lasted from the 1830s to the 1850s, when the railroad closed. During the following century, the town decreased in population and quietly shifted from an urban to a rural center until the 1950s, when migration of Altoonans from the north began to increase the size of Newry and gave it a more suburban character. Businesses and institutions The majority of Newry's businesses are found along the main north-south road, Old Route 220: just north of the town, a storage company and a small motor vehicles store; within Newry, several crafts shops and an electronics repair store; and immediately to the south, the largest business in the town, Leighty's, which comprises a convenience store, a computer systems, parts, and repair store, a golf driving range, a hunting outfitter, a flea market, a flower store, a gas station, and a bathroom and kitchen remodeling store. Along Patrick Lane, the southmost east-west road in the town, are located a post office, a small apartment building, a furniture store, a used home appliances and furniture store, and St. Patrick's Parish, a Roman Catholic parish comprising a small church, a graveyard, a shrine to Our Lady of Lourdes, and an elementary school. Along Allegheny Street, the northmost east-west street, one can find a Lutheran church, two bars,(McCoy's Tavern has since been closed down, a dance studio now resides in the building) and town hall. Events The two yearly events celebrated by the community, both held by St. Patrick's Parish, are the Lenten fish fries, held in the cafeteria of the school, and the summer festival, held near the end of July early August on the school playground and in the gymnasium. Both attract visitors from across the Altoona metropolis and greatly benefit the church and school. Surrounding areas To the north of Newry, Old Route 220 leads to Duncansville and then to Altoona and other points north. To the west, the Puzzletown Road curves to the southwest through a few miles of housing developments and into Puzzletown, where it becomes Knob Run Road, continues south-southwest up the Appalachian Plateau, up the mountain of Blue Knob and reaches the town of the same name. To the south, 220 leads through Leamersville and East Freedom, near McKee, and intersects with Interstate 99; it leads eventually to Bedford. To the east, the Catfish Road goes through a few miles of sparse farmland, interrupted by a few houses and a monastery, until it intersects Route 36, which leads north to Hollidaysburg and south to Roaring Spring.

It is part of the Altoona, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,644 at the 2010 census. Geography North Woodbury Township is located in the southeast corner of Blair County, with Bedford County to the south and east, and a small portion of Huntingdon County to the northeast. The township completely surrounds the borough of Martinsburg. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 20.8 square miles (53.9 km), all of it land. North Woodbury Township is to the south of Woodbury Township, Blair County. This geographical quirk is because the Township was formerly part of Bedford County, and is indeed north of Woodbury Township, Bedford County. The eastern border of the township follows the ridgecrest of Tussey Mountain.

The population was 2,585 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Altoona, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area History Roaring Spring was established around the Big Spring in Morrison's Cove, a clean and dependable water source vital to the operation of a paper mill. Prior to 1866, when the first paper mill was built, Roaring Spring had been a grist mill hamlet with a country store at the intersection of two rural roads that lead to the mill near the spring. A grist mill, powered by the spring water, had operated at that location since at least the 1760s. After 1867, as the paper mill expanded, surrounding tracts of land were acquired to accommodate housing development for new workers. The formalization of a town plan, however, never occurred. As a result, the seemingly random street pattern of the historic district is the product of hilly topography, a small network of pre-existing country roads that converged near the Big Spring, and the property lines of adjacent tracts that were acquired through the years for community expansion. The arterial streets of the district are now East Main, West Main, Spang and Bloomfield, each of which leads out of the borough to surrounding townships. Two of these streets ‚Äî Spang and East Main ‚Äî meet with Church Street at the district's main intersection called \\"Five Points.\\" The boundaries of the district essentially include those portions of Roaring Spring Borough which had been laid out for development by the early 1920s. This area encompasses or 55 percent of the borough's area of . Since the district's period of significance extends to 1944, most of those buildings erected after the 1920s were built as infill within the areas already subdivided by the 1920s. In the early 1960s, the Borough began to annex sections of adjacent Taylor Township, especially to the east around the then new Rt. 36 Bypass. Daniel Mathias (D. M.) Bare laid out Roaring Spring's first 50 building lots in 1865 after he and two partners decided to locate the region's first paper mill near the spring.[3] These lots were located within and around the so-called village \\"triangle\\" defined by West Main, Spang, and East Main Streets. By 1873, the borough contained about 170 lots and 50 buildings, which included the paper and grist mills, three churches, a company store, a schoolhouse, and one hotel. The population stood at about 100. The triangle remained the industrial, commercial and retailing core of the town until 1957 when the bypass of Main Street, PA Rt. 36, was built to the east of town through Taylor Township. As is true of many American small towns, many village merchants along with new businesses have since relocated to the new highway. The village core retains only a few shops and professional offices, but still holds the Roaring Spring Blank Book Company and Roaring Spring Water Bottling Company, all of the historic church buildings, the public library(formerly the Eldon Inn), the borough building, the post office(earlier moved from farther up East Main St.). The elementary school (former junior-senior high school)was demolished in 2010. Historic District The Roaring Spring Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Portions of the text below were adapted from a copy of the original nomination document. Note: This includes = Description = The Roaring Spring Historic District is located within the Borough of Roaring Spring, a paper- mill town of about 2,600 established in the late 1860s in southern Blair County, south-central Pennsylvania.[1] Roaring Spring is situated within the northwest quadrant of a long bowl-like valley known as Morrisons Cove, one of dozens of long but broad valleys in Pennsylvania's Ridge and Valley region. The town developed just southeast of a natural pass into the valley called McKee's Gap where an important iron smelting business (Martha Furnace) operated through the mid 19th century. The site of Roaring Spring is moderately hilly, drained by Cabbage and Halter Creeks. The most prominent natural feature is the Big Spring, or Roaring Spring, a large natural limestone spring so-called because of the great noise its eight-million- gallon-a-day stream once made rushing out of the hillside near the village center.[2] Roaring Spring is overwhelmingly residential (91 percent) in scale, but also includes churches, stops, professional offices, a municipal building, parks, a cemetery, a book factory complex, and a former railroad station. Most houses are two-story, wood-frame single-family buildings situated on lots of to . The largest segment of the building stock between 1865 and 1944 was constructed between the 1890s and 1930s. Architecturally, the district contains a variety of late 19th to early 20th century styles and vernacular building types, including Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, Bungalow, Foursquare, Gable Fronts, Gable Fronts & Wings, I Houses, and double-pile Georgian types. Ninety (90) percent of the district's 643 properties is rated as contributing. The remaining 10 percent consists of buildings less than 50 years old (constructed after 1944) or older buildings whose architectural integrity has been lost through inappropriate alterations. Overall, most alterations, such as inappropriate replacement of windows, doors and porch posts, are reversible if desired. Roaring Spring was established around the Big Spring, a clean and dependable water source vital to the operation of a paper mill. Prior to 1866, when the first paper mill was built, Roaring Spring had been a grist-mill hamlet with a country store at the intersection of two rural roads that lead to the mill near the spring.

Two of these streets ‚Äî Spang and East Main ‚Äî meet with Church Street at the district's main intersection called \\"The Five Points.\\" The boundaries of the district essentially include those portions of Roaring Spring Borough which had been laid out for development by the early 1920s. This area encompasses or 55 percent of the borough's area of .

As is true of many American small towns, many village merchants along with new businesses have since relocated to the new highway. The village core retains only a few shops and professional offices, but still holds the Roaring Spring Blank Book Company and Roaring Spring Water Bottling Company, all of the historic church buildings, the public library (the former Eldon Inn), the borough building, and the post office. Most of the historic commercial or mixed-use buildings are concentrated in the village triangle. These include an assortment of strictly commercial properties, such as the brick, three-story Odd Fellows Hall (1882) with its storefront and meeting hall above at 269 N. Main Street, the three-story, wood-frame Hite's Furniture Store (ca. 1888) next door, and the stone, three-story, semi-Romanesque Roaring Spring Bank (1902) next to the store at 257 N. Main Street. All three stand directly across the street from the former location of the Roaring Spring Department Store (ca. 1874), otherwise known as \\"the company store,\\" and across from the old Borough Building and Fire Station (1906). The grist mill, demolished in the 1980s, which also housed the town jail and street department, was between the borough building and the department store. This immediate area served as the commercial, governmental and industrial center of the town. Directly behind the company store to the west is the paper mill, while next door to the former Borough Building once stood the Bare flour mill (demolished 1960s), the early industrial forerunner to the paper mill. Mixed-use examples within this village area include the three-story brick Zook Building (ca. 1885) at East Main and Cemetery Streets, which formerly housed the post office, and two wood-frame store fronts with second-floor apartments on East Main. Another well-preserved example of this traditional mixed-use type is the former Stump's Grocery Store at Spang and Poplar Streets. While located outside of the village triangle, the general store was built by John F. Himes to serve one of the first new residential areas developed after the paper mill's plant expansion of 1878. The store was originally started at the five points where the borough building now stands and was moved to poplar street across from his home. Himes also operated a vinyard bordered by today's Spang, Girard, Poplar, and Cherry Streets of which one vine remains (as of 2011). He arrived as a German immigrant and worked as a stable boy at his uncle's hotel, which held the dry town's last (and maybe only) liquor license at the corner of Spang and West Main Street across from the railroad station. He also was instrumental in building St. Luke's Lutheran Church at the corner of Girard and East Main Street. In the decades following the Civil War, single-family residential development gradually spread over the low hills surrounding the village center. Roaring Spring's patterns of growth were largely determined by the periods of expansion for the paper mill and the Roaring Spring Blank Book Company, an affiliated business. The opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad branch line from Altoona in 1871 also stimulated a great deal of growth. During these periods, parcels of adjacent land or woodland were purchased and subdivided for new house construction. Through the 19th century, one of the larger private developers was D. M. Bare. One example of his work is the lots along Park Avenue, a site which he subdivided and sold off in 1885 after acquiring the George Spang Farm. Most homes in the district are set back between one and from the sidewalks. The lots are relatively narrow (50‚Äì60 ft.) but deep (120‚Äì150 ft.) with ample backyards that often hold one-story frame or brick garages on an alley serving an entire block. Average density is five to seven houses per acre. This configuration ‚Äî a single-family house sited close to the front lot line with a detached service building at the rear of a long backyard ‚Äî is the basic lot layout of towns in central Pennsylvania. Most of the rear-lot service buildings are either small 19th century carriage barns converted to garages or 20th century auto garages, depending upon the age of the house. The carriage barns are generally wood frame while the garages tend to be brick, depending upon the building material of the house. The moderately sloping topography did little to impede local builders, who merely terraced the sites and erected stone retaining walls to hold the yards. Because of the town's relatively stable employment patterns since the 1860s, Roaring Spring has enjoyed a high degree of home ownership. Of the 643 buildings in the district, over 92 percent were originally built as homes, most of which are single-family dwellings. Besides single-family houses, the district contains 21 apartments (mostly converted single-family residences); 14 mixed-use buildings (commercial/residential); 11 professional/commercial buildings (mostly converted houses); seven municipal properties; six industrial buildings (mostly the Blank Book complex); eight churches; and one cemetery. Sixty-three (63) percent of the district's building stock (contributing and noncontributing) is wood-frame; 33 percent is brick; the remaining 4 percent is stone or concrete block. With the exception of a few industrial or commercial buildings like the Blank Book Co. and the Planing Mill, nearly all of the district's brick buildings (mostly houses) are actually brick veneer over wood framing. The use of brick as a construction material peaked in the 1920s. Sixty-Nine (69) Percent of the foundations are stone, which supports almost all buildings erected before ca. 1920. While stone as a foundation material is common in pre-1920s buildings, its use as a structural material is very rare due in large measure to the common availability and economy of sawn lumber, and the age of the community which postdated the vernacular use of stone as a regional building material. As a foundation material, stone was generally replaced in the 1920s by cast concrete block (generally molded as a rock-face ashlar), which in turn was succeeded by cinderblock and poured concrete after the 1940s. After concrete and cinderblock, concrete block is the third most common foundation material (almost 3 percent); it was also employed for garages, outbuildings and additions in the 1920s and 1930s. Most contributing houses bear full front porches, the vast majority of which are intact. Original roof materials were generally slate or tin (raised seam, corrugated, or pressed pattern). While a fair number survive, many others have been replaced for economy with modern asphalt shingle. Even where original slate roofs have been replaced, many decorative slate shingles covering the fascia boards of large window gables survive, especially on turn-of-the- century Gothic Revival types. This decorative practice, fairly common on houses built from 1900 to 1920 by the Roaring Spring Planing Mill Co., can be seen in other period buildings around the Morrisons Cove area where the Planing Mill's contractors are known to have worked. Stylistically, the historic house types of Roaring Spring are largely vernacular adaptations of nationally common styles between the 1870s and early 20th century. From the 1870s to 1900s, these included Gothic Revivals, Queen Annes, Gable Fronts, Gable Front & Wings, I-Houses and double-pile Georgian types. From the 1900s to 1930s, a period which accounts for 54 percent of the historic housing stock, these included Bungalows, Four Squares, Colonial Revivals, and Cape Cod types, sometimes modestly detailed with Craftsman or Colonial Revival trim. The various styles and types generally reflect the national trends in builders' homes during those periods. Those houses built after the period of significance (post 1944) tend to be later Cape Cod types, ranches, bi-levels and a variety of other suburban builders' homes. The greatest number of extant Gable-Fronts (or Temple-Fronts) in the district were built between the 1890s and 1910s, although a few older examples date to the 1880s. A number of variations exist, such as the Gable Front & Wing and the Gable-Front & T Wing, the latter a local variant that builders from the Roaring Spring Planing Mill seemed to have favored in the 1900s. Most houses are balloon-frame construction, however, the Four-Square, built here in the greatest numbers between the 1900s and 1930s, is equally divided between wood and brick. Queen Annes range from the 1880s to 1910s, and are often really Four-Squares in form beneath a slightly more complicated roofline and decorated wall surface (ornamental slate or wood shingles) usually concentrated in the gables. The I- House, which ranges primarily between the 1850s and 1900s, is also equally divided between wood and brick. The center-door \\"Georgian\\" type (double-pile, side-gable roof, symmetrical massing) was built here between the 1850s and 1940s, with most examples ranging from four to five bays in width. After the Civil War, local builders often gave this type a large centered front gable, creating a Gothic Revival look, especially since most of these examples held full front porches with Gothic Revival trim. The Bungalow type, while not as common as the preceding four, was prevalent between the 1920s and 1930s. Many of the vernacular Gothic Revival and I-House dwellings, which line Locust Street in the Hogback neighborhood south of the mill, date from the late 1860s to 1870s. Farther away from the mill, on a hillside at the east end of the district, stand dozens of Four-Squares, Gable Fronts, and late Gothic Revival types built after the mill expansions of 1898 and 1912. These examples are found along New, Poplar, Walnut and Cherry Streets. Bungalow types from the 1920 to 1930s are scattered throughout the district in wood or brick. The triangular area of the old commercial village contains a mixture of residential, mixed-use, and commercial buildings dating from the 1870s to the early 1900s. Of the commercial types, perhaps the most impressive is the Eldon Inn (1907), a three-story, brick Colonial Revival at Main and Girard Streets built close to the passenger station for the convenience of railroad travelers. The inn, which never served liquor, was built by Bare and his three sons-in-law, in large measure to keep the town dry as it had been since the 1890s. The oldest known residence in this area is the Wilderson House (ca. 1872), a typical wood-frame I-House fronting on West Main Street just south of Girard Street. The district's eight churches, constructed of either brick, stone, or wood, were built between 1867 and 1934. The oldest is the wood-frame Mennonite meeting house on Poplar Street overlooking North Main, originally built for the Methodist congregation in 1867. The builder was the Rev. John A. J. Williams, a carpenter by trade, who also served briefly as Methodist minister. The two most prominently sited churches stand at the Five Points intersection: the Bare Memorial Church of God (1889‚Äì1930), a large brick building supported by the Bare family at East Main and Church Streets, and the Trinity United Methodist Church (1898), a stone building at East Main and Spang Streets. The district's only fully extant school building was the old Junior-Senior High School at the corner of Cemetery and Poplar Streets. Partially funded by the Works Progress Administration in 1936, this three- story brick and concrete building was designed in the Art Moderne mode by the architect Joseph Hoover, a native of the town. It was demolished in 2010. The civic center of the borough, counted as one of three contributing sites, is the borough park with its duck pond and fountain designed around the Big Spring. The present park, which Bare set aside for public use, is the result of successive improvement projects started in the 1870s and continuing through the early 20th century. A stone arch, counted as a contributing structure, was built in 1874 to channel the spring, and a breast dam was added in 1876 to impound the spring water into a pond; the first dam was replaced by the present steel and cement dam, a noncontributing structure, in 1958. Sometime in the 1920s to 1930s, the pond was further contained by a concrete basin. In 1937, the Bare Memorial Fountain, counted as a second contributing structure, with its oscillating streams and colored lights was added. The two other contributing sites are Greenlawn Cemetery and Memorial Park. Greenlawn, which is located between Cemetery and Girard Streets, contains many of the town's founding families and figures including D. M. Bare. Established high on one of the town's many hillsides, the cemetery is distinguished by its scenic vistas. Memorial Park, located at Grove and Locust Streets, was set aside by Bare, who gave the land to the school district in 1918. The site was originally called Sugar Grove, a smaller part of the Spang Farm which Bare purchased in 1885. Adjoining the Borough Park along Spang Street stands a row of large Victorian- era homes built in 1889 for D. M. Bare and members of his family. These are substantial yet loosely eclectic variations on the Queen Anne and Gothic Revival styles as rendered by builders from the Roaring Spring Planing Mill. Perhaps the most impressive is the Edwin G. Bobb House built closest to the park by a son-in-law of D. M. Bare. The rear yard of the house is the approximate former site of the George B. Spang House (ca. 1821), the home of the miller from whom D. M. Bare purchased the Mill Seat Tract in 1863. Spang had operated the gristmill in the settlement, which was known as Spang's Mill, since 1821. His homestead now stands at 724 Church Street, about one block away, where it was moved in 1889 by Bare prior to construction of the Bobb House. The Spang House is a typical five-bay, double-pile Georgian type dwelling, the core of which is log. Besides the Spang Street manager's row, the district contains two other large landmark houses built for local leaders: The Dr. W. A. Nason House built ca. 1900 at the south end of town between Locust and Oakmont Place, and the Dr. William M. Eldon House (ca. 1895-1900) at East Main and Cemetery Streets. Nason established a large private hospital that stood on the site of the YMCA between 1896 and 1961. His house is a boxy three-story Colonial Revival design made of the same local \\"blue\\" limestone as the Blank Book Company office (see below). Eldon was a son-in-law of D. M. Bare, a member of Dr. Nason's hospital staff, and the town druggist, whose former store at E. Main Street stands next door to the Eldon House. The house, which was constructed by the Roaring Spring Planing Mill in the old village triangle area, now contains apartments and an attorney's office. Across Spang Street overlooking the duck pond stands the Blank Book Company, an ancillary business founded by Bare in 1887 to produce ledgers, tablets and composition books from the mill's paper stock. Practically all of the book factory complex survives, including the impressive three-story Office and Warehouse Building (1900) constructed in a castellated fashion with quarry-faced ashlar cut from local \\"blue\\" limestone. The oldest building in the five-building complex is the two-story brick Binding Building (1888). The others include the Printing House (1895), a three-story brick building; the brick Shipping and Stock Room Building (1905) at three-stories; and the five-story brick Warehouse built in 1914.[4] An original fire station is located in the yard in front of the stone Blank Book building. Also adjoining the park at the west side is the surviving building (1904) from the Roaring Spring Planing Mill Company. The mill supplied finished lumber and pre-fabricated building components to area builders, and is credited with constructing most of the housing and other buildings in Roaring Spring. The company also supplied heating coal for home furnaces. Co-founded in 1887 by D. M. Bare, the planing mill was initially owned in fourths by Bare and other partners. Although the company erected dozens of houses, its early years were not profitable and the partnership sold out to D. M. Bare & Co. in 1897. A devastating fire in 1903 destroyed the original 1887 wood-frame complex. The present building, a one-story brick structure with gable roof, dates from ca. 1904 and replaced one of the originals destroyed by fire. Three or four other mill buildings, also constructed after the fire, have since been demolished and an open lawn planted in their place. Between 1910 and 1920, the Planing Mill Co. erected 97 buildings (14 frame and 83 brick), principally houses. Extant examples of its work include many of the borough's buildings erected between 1887 and the early 1950s. As several examples, the earliest homes on New Street, between Church and Lower Streets, were built in 1909 by the Planing Mill. The remaining building now houses The Roaring Spring Bottled Water company store. Along Main Street, to the west of the book factory and park, stands the Roaring Spring Passenger Station (ca. 1905). This one-story brick building with hipped roof was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad for its Morrisons Cove Branch to serve the paper mill. Remarkably, it is the only historic passenger station surviving in Blair County.[5] It now housed the historical society. The branch line remains intact and is used weekly for freight service to the paper mill and points south in Morrisons Cove. A PRR caboose is displayed here. Architecturally, the district is quite intact overall. Eight-seven (87) percent of the district's 617 properties are rated as contributing. The remaining 13 percent consist of buildings less than 50 years old or those few older buildings whose alterations or additions have destroyed their architectural integrity. Approximately 65 percent of the noncontributing stock consists of buildings less than 50 years old. The four principal noncontributing buildings in the district are the Roaring Spring Bottling Company (ca. 1980) located on West Main Street behind the Blank Book Company, the YMCA building (1986) at Grove and Main Streets, the Borough Building (ca. 1948) at Spang, Church and East Main Streets, and the former Roaring Spring Department Store building (the Company Store). Although the core of the store dates to ca. 1874, successive alterations, especially in 1961, destroyed the integrity of the building. The paper mill complex contains just two small historic buildings: a one-story frame maintenance building (1900) and a two- story brick-and-frame clay house (c. 1900). A major explosion and fire in 1951 destroyed many of the older buildings. The mill owners have since demolished many others over the years to upgrade the plant.[6] Because so little historic fabric survives, and the two historic buildings are not visible from the public road, the mill complex has been drawn out of the district. Only one important contributing resource has experienced significant contextual change: the area around the planing mill building, which was surrounded originally by other mill buildings on three sides, has been cleared for a lawn and parking lot as part of the borough park area. While some individual buildings have undergone contemporary remodeling, the district retains its fundamental architectural integrity. As is common to this region, many wood-frame buildings have been sided with either vinyl or aluminum. Some houses have also had windows replaced with modern sash, resulting in some loss of architectural detail. A much smaller number have had their original sliding sash replaced with large \\"picture\\" windows or bay windows. In other cases, Victorian-era porch posts and ornamental details like brackets have been replaced with simple square posts or iron rod supports. Some roofs, which originally were metal (either raised seam, corrugated or a stamped pattern), have been replaced with modern composite shingle. A modest number of these early 20th century metal surfaces, which were corrugated or stamped pattern, survive. Original slate roofs exist in more significant numbers. Perhaps half of these examples have been covered with a silver paint applied as a sealant and heat reflectant. Despite the results of contemporary maintenance, a large majority of buildings retain many other significant features, such as original windows, doors, porches, chimneys and rooflines. Other underlying characteristics, such as building scale, massing, setbacks and site location, remain intact as well. Overall, most of the common renovations, such as modern siding and inappropriate porch posts, are relatively superficial and reversible if desired. =Significance= The Roaring Spring Historic District is locally significant in the areas of architecture, industry and social history as an excellent example of a paternally founded and managed paper-mill town in central Pennsylvania, one whose architecture reflects how the growth of a hometown, family-owned industry stimulated and, in many cases, directed the development patterns and architectural character of the community. As the first paper-mill town in Blair County, Roaring Spring played an important role in establishing a small regional paper industry.[7] Only two other paper mills have operated in the immediate region: one in Tyrone, co-founded by D. M. Bare in 1878, and the other in Williamsburg started in 1905 by steel magnate Charles Schwab.[8] The Borough of Roaring Spring and its paper mill were essentially the creation of one person, Daniel Mathias Bare (1834‚Äì1925). As the town's 50th year history noted: \\"To write a detailed account of the life and activities of Daniel Mathias Bare is practically equivalent to writing the industrial, and, to a very great extent, the institutional history of Roaring Spring. From the time he located here in 1864 until the time of his death he was pre-eminently the town's greatest leader, occupying the foremost ranks of those who promoted its industrial, commercial and religious enterprises.\\"[9] Based on Bare's leadership, a good geographical location and a plentiful supply of clean water, the town became a successful regional producer of paper and related products from 1867 onward. Architecturally, the commercial, industrial, institutional, and residential character of the town retains an integrity that accurately conveys the developmental evolution of the community between 1821 and 1944. Before 1868, Roaring Spring was called Spang's Mill, a hamlet in Taylor Township situated around a gristmill operated by George B. Spang.[10] The area was patented in the 1760s by white settlers attracted to the Big Spring, an eight-million-gallon-a-day limestone spring that emerges from a hillside in the center of town. At least as early as the 1760s, a gristmill was operated here by a German Dunkard named Jacob Neff and it was called Neff's Mill. German Dunkards and Scots-Irish Presbyterians were the predominant pioneer groups in Morrisons Cove during the late 18th century. As late as the 1750s, the land around the spring had probably contained a village of Lenni Lenape Indians.[11] Ironmaking played a contributing role in Spang Mill's early growth, especially through the Civil War before the paper mill was founded. The village stood about mid course between a large iron furnace (Martha Furnace) at McKee's Gap to the north and an iron-ore quarry to the south at Bloomfield. Teamsters driving the ore wagons often traded at the gristmill and a general store. The district's oldest known building from this pre-paper mill era is the Johannes Lower House, a log farmhouse at 912 Bloomfield St., built ca. 1808‚Äì10. Although substantially enlarged and covered with siding, the south half of the structure still contains the original house. At the time, Bloomfield Street was a country road leading through Morrisons Cove toward McKee's Gap. D. M. Bare moved with his wife to Spang's Mill in 1864 after having purchased the \\"Mill Seat Tract\\" with his father, a farmer from Sinking Valley in Blair County, north of Altoona. Attracted to the location because of the spring's dependable flow and superior water quality, Bare initially operated the gristmill and general store. He built the first paper mill in 1866 with two partners, John Eby and John Morrison, but a disastrous fire destroyed the wood-frame building just after its completion. The three men rebuilt on the site almost immediately, and by 1867 were in business again, establishing a trade in low-grade paper made from rag, gunny sacking and straw. Through the rest of the 19th century, the mill evolved from a maker of manila wrapping paper and newspaper to a manufacturer of fine bond by the late 1930s. The Bares had three daughters, all of whom married men that Bare groomed to manage various aspects of the family business. In time, all three ‚Äî Dr. Abraham L. Garver, Edwin G. Bobb and Dr. William M. Eldon ‚Äî became partners and/or managers in one of Bare's largely family-controlled companies. Throughout his working life, Bare retained partners in most of his business ventures, although he appears to have maintained control over these operations either through intermediaries or family members. The paper mill was incorporated in 1907 and the Bare family retained ownership until 1946 when the business was sold to a paper company from Wisconsin.[12] Since 1867, when the mill began operation, the plant has been expanded or substantially retooled at least nine times: 1875, 1878, 1892, 1898, 1912, 1924, ca. 1946, 1951 and 1972, according to the town's centennial history. In 1873, Bare's single wood-frame building produced . of paper a day, not quite one ton. Two years later, a boiler explosion forced Bare & Co. to rebuild, converting the cotton rag mill to wood pulp production. A second paper machine was added in 1878, and by 1881 production had increased to 3 tons a day. A third machine was added in 1892, and in 1898 the plant was completely retooled. By 1905, following the installation of a bleach-making plant and the reconstruction of the steam-power plant, output averaged nearly 26 tons a day. By 1937, production had increased to 40 tons a day and the mill employed 250 people.[13] Each time the mill expanded or retooled, older outmoded structures were demolished and new ones added, until 1951 when a major explosion destroyed many of the remaining historic buildings. D. M. Bare's influence can be found in practically every aspect of town life: out of his general store in 1864, he developed a department store which became known as \\"the company store;\\", now Roaring Spring Department Store, in 1867, he co-sponsored the construction of the first Methodist Church; from 1868 to 1883, he served as one of the first postmasters, nominating the village's name change to Roaring Spring in 1868; he oversaw the creation of the town's first modern utilities, including the telephone system (1880), the water supply (1892), and electrical service (1892). The paper company underwrote the cost of extending a line from Altoona to Roaring Spring where the first telephone was installed in the head office of the mill. In a desire to create more jobs in 1887, Bare co-founded the Roaring Spring Blank Book Company, which became a primary customer for his paper, and later generated electric current for residential service until the 1920s. Bare eventually entrusted the operation of Blank Book to his son-in- law, Dr. A. L. Garver, who joined the company at its founding and became general manager by 1891. Garver is credited with building Blank Book into the world's third leading maker of accounting book and school stationery by the 1920s.[14] In the 1880s, Bare set aside land for the town's first public parks: Memorial Park at Grove Street and the Borough Park at Spang and Spring Streets. In 1902, he founded the town's first bank, and through the 1900-1910s oversaw the brick paving of many public streets. In 1907, he co-founded the Eldon Inn with his three sons-in-law as the town's leading hotel for business travelers. Throughout his lifetime here (1863‚Äì1925), Bare is credited with playing many other informal roles to help organize and improve the community life of the town. Bare played his most substantial role in shaping the architectural character of the town through co-founding the Roaring Spring Planing Mill in 1887. Operated as a heating coal and building supply business with a contracting service on the side, the mill is credited with constructing most of the houses and other buildings of note in Roaring Spring between 1887 and the early 1950s. While the company records have been lost, the personal records of David S. Smaltz (1861‚Äì1935), a carpenter who worked for the contracting business are impressive. Smaltz's own accounts kept by the family in the 1960s recorded that between 1904 and 1935 he helped build 68 houses on Walnut Street, 26 houses on Roosevelt Avenue, eight houses on Church Street, and 54 houses on New Street.[15] This figure of 148 is bolstered by D. M. Bare's account in his autobiography where he stated that 97 buildings were erected by the planing mill between 1910 and 1920. The construction policies and practices of the planing mill company were not dictated directly by Bare, but through a partnership, as most of his business operations were arranged. Nonetheless, there appears to have been a cohesive similarity of architectural taste and purpose at work here whose basic aesthetic must have been set by Bare and his association of partners, managers and builders. Bare also may be credited with creating the town's first subdivision of 50 lots in 1865. Given the extent and central location of his original holding from the Mill Seat Tract, and the fact that most of the town's pre-1944 building lots are to , Bare's ability to shape the size and extent of development in Roaring Spring was substantial. The planing mill's most active periods of development coincided with the greatest periods of expansion for the paper mill and book company. As new jobs were created, the population grew, and with it the demand for more housing. The paper mill's periods of expansion (within the period of significance), which postdated the founding of the planing mill, were 1892, 1898, 1912, 1924, and ca. 1946. During that same general period, the town's population more than tripled from 920 to just over 3,000 between 1890 and 1940.[16] The influence of Bare and his family over the development and affairs of one town is rather remarkable for this region. Only two comparative community models come to mind in southwestern Pennsylvania: the brick refractories towns and coal mining towns. Alexandria and Mount Union, both in neighboring Huntingdon County, were shaped in varying degrees by the refractories industry in the early 20th century. Both witnessed the construction of worker housing in the 1910s that was financed either directly by or independently of the industry. Beyond that, however, few across the board generalizations can be made regarding the industry's architectural impact on these communities, or others like them in the region. Some brick manufacturers were indeed family-owned and operated, while many others were divisions of larger corporations. Some built whole blocks of company housing, as in Mount Union, while others only dabbled in development, allowing local builders to meet the demand, as in Alexandria. Some housing resembled military barracks, as in the semi-detached houses of Mount Union, while others built single-family houses, as in South Alexandria.[17] The other comparable regional model is the coal company town. Here everything was built following a company engineer's formula ‚Äî from street layout to house plan ‚Äî and most every structure reflected a hierarchy of design. Roaring Spring, by contrast, contains few, if any, of the coal company town's typical two-story semi- detached frame dwellings that fill the checkerboard streets of places like Colver (est. 1890s) in Cambria County or Windber (est. 1910s) in Somerset County.[18] And while Roaring Spring's patriarchal management may have desired orderly community development, it did not impose a blatantly class-structured environment on its work force. One other comparative, if exceptional, community exists in the immediate region: The borough of Kistler, was built as a model workers' town in Mifflin County by a Mount Union refractories company. Located just over the Juniata River from Mount Union, Kistler was designed in 1916-17 by John Nolen, a noted town planner from Cambridge, Massachusetts. The president of the Mount Union Refractories hired Nolen to create a model town, apparently inspired by the Progressive Era notion that superior housing and other community amenities designed under a master plan would improve the moral character of its inhabitants.[19] But in its architecture and layout, Roaring Spring resembles neither a company town nor a model workers community. Unlike coal company towns, Roaring Spring possesses a relatively wide variety of housing types without a hierarchical town plan, and unlike a model community like Kistler, no master plan appears at work like a template beneath the townscape. Instead, Roaring Spring's street pattern evolved episodically from a combination of natural topography, pre-existing land tracts, and the confluence of old country roads at the Big Spring. Architecturally, Roaring Spring's neighborhoods display relatively little hierarchy by income or occupation. Admittedly, some areas, like the Hogback just south of the paper mill, were especially known as mill workers' enclaves, but overall the town lacks the strong homogeneity of worker house types and segmentation by occupational class common to coal company towns. D. M. Bare and his cohorts seemed to have envisioned Roaring Spring as a working community of middle- class homeowners plucked from the ranks of shopkeepers, professionals and skilled workers. The relative success of this ideal may be accounted for by the large number of skilled workers required for paper and book-making. These workers, their supervisors and the office staffs earned wages high enough to become property owners over time. Indeed, one of the achievements that D. M. Bare mentioned with pride in his autobiography was the high degree of home ownership that Roaring Spring enjoyed by 1920. Although this egalitarian vision was carried out largely from a patriarchal vantage, its ideal is reflected in the general uniformity of lot sizes through the historic district. Each lot is just large enough to accommodate a single-family home with room for a vegetable garden and garage in the rear. Most houses are sited toward the front of their lots with modest front yards and deep backyards. Earlier houses, built along the older streets like Main and Spang, follow the traditional regional pattern of being situated close to the front lot line; later houses, built after 1900, are situated slightly back. The exceptions to this rule are the five generous house sites next to the spring on Spang Street that were set aside by Bare for his family. By local standards, these were palatial houses set on deep lots of with relatively expansive wooded lawns. Unlike heavier industrial centers in the greater region, such as Johnstown and Pittsburgh, Roaring Spring's population had remained relatively homogeneous in ethnic, racial and political terms, a historical factor that reinforced the outward social cohesiveness of the community. During the early decades of the 20th century, as the nation experienced large waves of immigration from eastern and southern Europe, the town remained primarily old-stock Protestant descendants of Germans and Scotch Irish. It also failed to experience the great northern migration of African Americans from the South looking for factory jobs after the Second World War. Roman Catholics were the last major mainstream denomination to establish a congregation in Roaring Spring. Prior to 1969, most local Roman Catholics worshipped at St. Patrick's in Newry, an Irish-founded parish about away. The town has also remained true to the temperance movement as championed by D. M. Bare from his earliest days. Under the Bare family influence, the town went dry in the 1890s and remains so today, as does all of the Morrisons Cove valley. It is also revealing that while the paper mill was family owned, local labor unions were practically nonexistent. The first union local ‚Äî United Brotherhood of Pulp and Sulphite Workers (AFL) ‚Äî was not organized until 1943. Most of Roaring Spring's architecture belongs to a nationally common set of styles and types influenced by the rise of the railroad after 1850. The Pennsylvania Railroad's connection to the town in 1871 had a significant effect on this development by drawing the paper mill, and with it the village, into the mainstream of national commerce. The railroad opened national markets to the paper mill, allowing its business to expand beyond a narrow regional scope. By the mid-19th century, as Roaring Spring was first growing, the regional peculiarities of folk architecture were gradually disappearing under the railroad's and the industrial revolution's influences. As the town grew with the paper mill, especially after the P.R.R.'s branch line opened, the new housing styles reflected national trends rather than local vernacular traditions. Roaring Spring can be compared in this regard with the only other paper-mill towns in the region: Tyrone and Williamsburg, both in Blair County. Tyrone, which is located on the Juniata River above Altoona, was fairly well established by 1878 when D. M. Bare co-founded a paper mill there. The new worker housing built from that year forward took on the same architectural character as Roaring Spring's after 1878. Williamsburg had originated as an 1830s canal town on another branch of the Juniata northeast of Hollidaysburg. In 1905, its community leaders persuaded former native and steel tycoon Charles Schwab to build a large paper mill. Williamsburg's post-1905 development thereafter came to resemble Roaring Spring's in style and type. The construction of comfortable single-family houses became quite common, especially Foursquares and large Gable Front types. These two examples suggest that the region's paper industry offered skilled workers' wages sufficient to support home ownership, and that local builders' housing styles in central Pennsylvania were already homogeneous by the 1870s. One of the exceptions to this national trend is the Mennonite meeting house, originally built for the Methodist Episcopal congregation in 1867. The term \\"meeting house\\" is appropriate for this building, which bears none of the vaguely Gothic effects of most post- Civil War American churches. Rather, it is a regional throwback ‚Äî an unadorned house-like structure common to early 19th century central Pennsylvania when new congregations often first met in private homes before building simple meeting houses as their first church. The Methodists were the first organized denomination (1802) in Roaring Spring, and this building was the town's first house of worship. The builder, the Rev. John A. J. Williams (1833‚Äì1909), was a Methodist minister by calling and a carpenter by trade, who moved to Roaring Spring after the Civil War. One of the borough's early leading citizens, he is credited with building many pre-1887 structures in Roaring Spring before the Roaring Spring Planing Mill's founding, including a number of houses on the south side of E. Main Street between Spang and Poplar Streets. Master builders and carpenters like Williams, guided by patrons like D.H. Bare who also helped underwrite the Methodist church, determined the look of Roaring Spring's architecture rather than professional architects. The builders, in most cases, were not design innovators but craftsmen who adapted plans from myriad national sources such as catalogs, pattern books, magazines, mail-order services, lumberyard fliers, and trade literature. While pattern books had been available to American builders as early as the 18th century, mail-order design services became nationally common by the 1880s. Along with the influence of the railroad and mass-circulation magazines, all of these homogenizing influences contributed to the decline of regional vernacular architecture and the spread of nationally accepted styles. Significantly, many of these sources targeted conservative markets, promoting traditional designs that appealed to small-town America. As one example of this phenomenon, many of the houses in Roaring Spring built around the start of the 20th century appear to be older Victorian types, such as many Gothic Revivals models of the era which are really double-pile Georgian types in plan. Presumably, this conservative impulse was of small concern to the first owners who paid little attention to \\"high style\\" design trends. What most homeowners looked for in a house was comfort, serviceability, and an acceptable level of appeal conforming with their community's taste. Quite often, the local distributor of trade literature and new construction trends in a small town was the neighborhood building supply center. In Roaring Spring, as in many regional towns and cities, the planing mill fulfilled that function. As a result, the importance of planing mills like Roaring Spring's in shaping the architectural character of communities in this region cannot be overstated. These operations supported builders by providing not only design plans and new ideas, but finished lumber, paint, roofing materials, and pre-fabricated components like windows, doors and molding for thousands of construction projects throughout the region. As the critical link in the local building industry, they have helped set the style for communities throughout central Pennsylvania from the beginning of the railroad era in the 1850s to the present. In summary, Roaring Spring stands as an excellent example of a paternally founded and managed paper-mill town in central Pennsylvania, one whose buildings reflect how the growth of a hometown family-owned industry stimulated and, in many cases, directed the development patterns and architectural character of the community. Architecturally, the commercial, industrial, institutional, and residential character of Roaring Spring town retains an integrity that accurately conveys the developmental evolution of the community between 1821 and 1944. The themes of Industry, Architecture and Social History, make Roaring Spring an excellent example of a locally significant historic district.  Geography  Roaring Spring is located at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. The town features a natural spring, which empties out into a pond, which is known to locals as the Spring Dam. The Spring Dam also contains many large fish. The water is very clear, allowing visitors to see all the way to the bottom of the pond.  Education  Roaring Spring is home to the Spring Cove School District administration offices. The school district consists of two elementary Schools (Spring Cove Elementary and Martinsburg Elementary), the Spring Cove Middle School and Central High School.

The population was 1,254 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Altoona, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Before the first settlers arrived in the vicinity of what was later called the Big Spring, this area was part of the hunting grounds of the Lenape and Shawnee. On July 6, 1754 a treaty was signed at Albany, New York between the Iroquois and the William Penn heirs, opening up portions of the west for settlement. However, British policy forbidding western expansion was in effect until after the American Revolution. The massacre of Captain William Phillips' Rangers took place near Williamsburg in July 1780. Ten men were murdered after surrendering to a party of Indians. On September 17, 1789, George Reynolds took out a patent from the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania for a large tract of unsettled land surrounding the Big Spring which flows into the Juniata River. The borough was founded in 1790 by Jacob Ake. Originally called Aketown, it is the oldest borough in the current borders of Blair County. The name change was in honor of William Ake, Jacob's son. By 1810, there were 34 houses in the village; the census of 1820 notes an inn, a distillery, and the presence of one slave. The Main Line of the Pennsylvania Canal was completed in 1832, and opened on November 28 when the packetboat \\"John Blair\\" left Huntingdon, for the west. The Blair County Children's Home was located in Williamsburg for many years until its destruction by fire. Today, the borough is approximately 30 blocks, centered on High and Second Streets. This comprises the Williamsburg Historic District, listed by the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Nearby places also listed are: Etna Furnace and the Daniel Royer House. Originally served by a canal along the Frankstown Branch Juniata River, the canal was abandoned in 1872. In the following year, the Pennsylvania Railroad completed a branch line from Hollidaysburg to Williamsburg along the old canal towpath. It would eventually be extended to Petersburg in 1900, completing a bypass of the main line known as the Hollidaysburg and Petersburg Branch. The railroad supplied passenger service on the branch until 1933. Freight service would continue until 1982, when Conrail abandoned the line through Williamsburg. It is now the Lower Trail (vide infra). The Blair County Children's Home, established in 1902, was located in Williamsburg, PA for many years until it was destroyed by fire on Aug. 2, 1975. Geography Williamsburg is located at (40.461587, -78.203954). According to the United States Census Bureau, Williamsburg has a total area of , all of it land. According to the US Geological survey, Williamsburg and the surrounding area sits on a 550 feet thick bed of sandstone, divided into medina white, red, and gray, with beds of red shale. Below that is the Oneida band, a 500 feet thick bed of greenish gray, iron speckled and very hard sandstone. Williamsburg is accessed by Pennsylvania Route 866, approximately fifteen miles from Altoona to the west and thirteen miles from Huntingdon to the east. The streets are laid out in a grid pattern; going from the Juniata River southward are First (or Front) Street, Second Street, Third Street, and Fourth Street (east side of the borough only). Union Street and Academy Alley/Sage Hill Drive follow the same direction of Fourth Street, if it continued. The main street is High Street, which runs through the center of the borough. Going east from High Street are Spring, Liberty, and Locust Streets; going west are Plum, Black, and Taylor Streets, with Dean Street just over the municipal line in Woodbury Township.http://www.maptechnica.com/us-city-boundary- map/city/Williamsburg/state/PA/cityid/4285272 Union Street was named in honor of the federal union; Liberty Street for American liberty. Locust and Plum were named for trees. Black, Taylor and Dean were named for three Blair County judges born in Williamsburg. Academy Alley borders the school property. A small cross street along the eastern side of the high school, is named Blue Pirate Street, after the school mascot. The Juniata River borders the borough. Piney Creek flows into this river to the west of the borough, and Clover Creek to the east. Across the river is Robeson Extension, usually considered part of Williamsburg, but actually lying in Catharine Township. Street names from the borough extend into the Extension, with the addition of Recreation Drive (borders the ballfields) and Home Street (borders Grace Pointe Community Church, former site of the Blair County Children's Home). The Williamsburg Farm show is held at the complex in Robeson Extension. Approaching Williamsburg on Route 866 from the northwest, after crossing the Juniata River two natural landmarks can be seen on the left. One is locally named Indian Rocks and is a series of exposed ridges of tall chimney like stone formations (one larger than the others). The other is a flat rock outcropping locally named Table Rock. Native American legends are associated with these rock formations. A hiker standing on top of Table Rock has a view over the entire town. On the south side of Williamsburg is a large natural spring locally named The Big Spring. This water source is the reason Charles Schwab, the steel tycoon wanted to build a steel mill in Williamsburg. Ultimately Schwab built a paper mill and a housing development on the east side of Williamsburg, referred to as Schwab Town in the early years. The Big Spring is a favorite photography location for wedding parties. Wilmer Stultz was born on a farm on Piney Creek Road south of Williamsburg. After his father died when he was age 14, his mother moved with Wilmer into Williamsburg where they lived on Spring Street (named after The Big Spring). He was an aviator who piloted Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, as a passenger across the Atlantic. In July 1928, Amelia Earhart accompanied Wilmer to Williamsburg where a gigantic welcome celebration was held including Wilmer, Amelia, and Lou Gordon riding through Williamsburg in an open convertible and accompanied by state police escorts. In July 1929, Amelia attended Wilmer's funeral in Williamsburg after he died in an airplane accident in New York City (Long Island). He is buried, with his wife, in the Presbyterian Cemetery near The Big Spring.

In the past, various iron products were made there. In 1900, 5,243 people lived there; in 1910, 6,426 people lived there, and in 1940, 7,569 persons made their homes in Sayre. The population was 5,587 at the 2010 census. Sayre is part of the Penn-York Valley (\\"The Valley\\"), a group of four contiguous communities in New York and Pennsylvania: Waverly, New York; South Waverly, Pennsylvania; Sayre; Athens, Pennsylvania, and smaller surrounding communities with a combined population near 35,000. Sayre is the principal city of the Sayre, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area.  History  In May 1870, a Waverly banker named Howard Elmer, along with Charles Anthony and James Fritcher, bought the Pine Plains area between Waverly and Athens. Elmer convinced Asa Packer to locate a new railroad repair facility on the Pine Plains for the expanding Lehigh Valley Railroad, which was making a push north to connect to the Erie Railroad at Waverly. Robert Heysham Sayre, president of the Pennsylvania and New York Railroad, helped cement the deal. The town was named in his honor. Sayre was incorporated on January 27, 1891. In 1904 when the locomotive shops were built at Sayre, the main shop building was believed to be the largest structure in the world under one roof, but held that title for only a brief time. The railroad operated from 1870 until 1976, but maintenance facilities were shifted away before that. With the decline of industry, population has declined since 1940. The Pennsylvania Guide, compiled by the Writers' Program of the Works Progress Administration, described Sayre in 1940 and emphasized the economic and social significance of the railroad, noting that Sayre: Geography Sayre is located at (41.983567, -76.520845) in a river valley in the Allegheny Plateau just north of the confluence of the Susquehanna River and the Chemung River, along with Athens, Pennsylvania, South Waverly, Pennsylvania, and Waverly, New York. Together, these small towns make up the greater area known as the Penn-York Valley, or just \\"the Valley\\". The New York / Pennsylvania border cuts through the valley. There is no physical border between the towns, as the grid of streets and avenues blend seamlessly from one town to another.

It was originally known as M'chwihilusing. The Moravian Christian Munsees for several years had a settlement Friedenshuetten (Tents of Peace) in what is now Wyalusing. Before 1750 the settlement was known as Gahontoto and was home to the Tehotachsee tribe of Native Americans. This small tribe would eventually be completely wiped out by the Cayuga tribe. In 1792 the chief of the Cayugas and about 20 other families rebuilt the town. In the 19th century the town began to prosper as it became a shipping area for logs and other items on the Susquehanna River. In 1820 the construction of the Welles Mill along Wyalusing Creek made Wyalusing a prime area for people to farm and raise crops. In 1887 Wyalusing became a borough. Many of the buildings constructed in the late 19th century and early 1920s are still part of Main Street today. Cargill meat packing plant, Wyalusing Wyalusing is home to one of the biggest beef processing plants on the east coast. Cargill regional beef Wyalusing is located just a couple miles outside of town. This plant was originally started in the late 1970s by the local Taylor family as a small meat processing plant. It eventually grew into a multimillion-dollar business that employs over 1,200 people from the surrounding area. Cargill is one of the biggest suppliers of ground beef to large grocery chains such as Wegmans, Giant, Shop Rite and more. In 2002 the Taylor family sold the business to the Cargill corporation, one of the largest privately owned companies in the United States.

The township is composed of many communities, including Andalusia, Bensalem, Bridgewater, Cornwells Heights, Eddington, Flushing, Oakford, Siles, Trappe, and Trevose.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, P22. Bensalem Township has no incorporated municipalities (city or borough) within its boundaries. As of the 2010 census, the township had a total population of 60,427, which makes it the most populated municipality in Bucks County, and the ninth most populated municipality in Pennsylvania. The township, which was founded in 1692, is almost as old as Pennsylvania itself, which was founded in 1682. Origins The origin of the name Bensalem likely comes from references made by settler Joseph Growden, who named his estate Manor of Bensalem in honor of William Penn and the Semitic term for peace, Salem.Bensalem Township. Bensalemtwp.org (1979-03-19). Retrieved on 2013-07-21. It was originally named Salem; the first syllable Ben was added in 1701. History The area of Bensalem Township was likely distinct by 1682 as it appears on the Holme Map, thought not yet with a name. By 2 January 1685, the boundary was fixed between Bensalem and Philadelphia County along the Poquessing Creek. At the September session in 1692 of the Court of Bucks County, a jury of thirteen men was formed to define boundaries of divisions that had been created up to that time. The report submitted in December states that \\"All the lands between Neshamineh and Poquessin, and so to the upper side of Joseph Growden's land in one and to be called 'Salem.'\\" It thus appears that the first name of the township was 'Salem'. The minutes of the Board of Property of the Province on 19 November 1701 at Philadelphia noted the name of the area as 'Bensalem'. The population of the area was first a few Dutch and Swedes, then later a larger influx of English, and then additional Dutch settled the area.

The population was 1,277 at the 2010 census. The township was originally a part of adjacent Nockamixon Township, but a division was arranged and signed on May 24, 1890. This accord split an area of Nockamixon which ran west from the banks of the Delaware River to about one third the breadth of the original township. This smaller area was unsurprisingly named \\"Bridgeton\\", as it was the site of Upper Black Eddy-Milford Bridge covered wooden truss bridge built in 1842, which connected the towns of Upper Black Eddy and Milford, New Jersey. The original covered bridge was replaced by a truss bridge in 1933.

With the construction of a centralized post office in Upper Black Eddy, the usage of separate names for the smaller towns ceased in an official capacity, and the everyday errands of residents became centered on the largest of the towns. What little commercial trade exists in the township is now centered solely in Upper Black Eddy, with any evidence of there being any distinctive, smaller villages existing only on outdated road- signs and maps.

Bristol Borough predates Philadelphia, being settled in 1681 and first incorporated in 1720. After 1834, the town became very important to the development of the American Industrial Revolution as the terminus city of the Delaware Canal providing greater Philadelphia with the days High Tech Anthracite fuels from the Lehigh Canal via Easton. The canal and a short trip on the Delaware also gave the town access to the mineral resources available in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York via each of the Morris Canal, the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, and connected the community to those markets and trade from New York City. These were among the factors spurring development of Bristol and nearby towns, explaining in part the industries which developed in the region. Although its charter was revised in 1905, the original charter remains in effect, making Bristol Borough the third oldest borough in Pennsylvania after Chester and Germantown. Bristol Borough had 7,104 residents in 1900; 9,256 in 1910; 10,273 in 1920; and 11,895 in 1940. The most recent census has the population at 9,726 2010 census. The current mayor is Joseph A. Saxton. Bristol Borough is served by SEPTA's Trenton Line.  History  Samuel Clift founded the Borough of Bristol, having received a land grant from Edmund Andros, Governor of New York. The grant became effective on March 14, 1681 (new style) or March 4, 1681 (old style) at the same time as William Penn's Charter from Charles II became effective. Clift was required by the grant to maintain ferry service across the Delaware River to Burlington, New Jersey, and to run a public house or inn. The inn later became known as the George II. Bristol Borough was settled in 1681, and named after Bristol, England. It was originally used as a port and dock. Bristol Borough is rich in history, boasting many historic and restored houses that line the streets of Radcliffe and Mill. In 1697, the Pennsylvania Provincial Council ordered that a town be laid out that this location. A petition was submitted by Joseph Bond, Anthony Burton, John Hall and William Wharton to the Council for incorporation, and was granted in 1702.Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania; George MacReynolds; 1955; Bristol Until 1725, Bristol Borough served as county seat of Bucks County. From its earliest days Bristol Borough was a center of textile mills, foundries, milling, and miscellaneous manufacturing. With the building of the long, forty feet wide, and five feet deep Delaware Canal--it became a transshipment gatewayDelaware Canal was later organized and known as the Pennsylvania Canal (Delaware Division). connecting the anthracite barges flowing down the Lehigh Canal's end terminal at Easton to Philadelphia. Bristol Borough was chosen to terminate the Delaware Canal because it already had regular shipping connections to other parts of Philadelphia and Delaware River ports by both the era's typical animal powered barges and era typical coastal/inland shipping vessels. Its docks also had regular ferry services to New Jersey and other points east from as early as 1681 until 1931. Developed by John Fitch, Bristol was the home of the first steamboat ferry service taking up to 30 passengers bound for Philadelphia and other ports on the DelawareSteam boat service between Trenton, New Jersey and Philadelphia also played a key role in community development, since many lines had historic sailing ship ferry stops in Bristol. In 1740, William Davis built a shipyard in Bristol building small vessels such as schooners and sloops. One such vessel was the Morning Glory, noted for being the fastest sailing craft on the Delaware. In 1800, John Reed acquired the shipyard. The historic King George II Inn, in downtown Bristol Borough House on Mill Street constructed in 1781 Grundy Mills Complex, a former textile mill in Bristol Borough. Bristol Borough's Harriman Historic District. The expense of digging the canal was justifiable as the banks of the Delaware southerly from Easton were less suitable, there was insufficient real estate for extensive additional docks, so the legislature figured the Delaware Canal avoided the need to transship barge loads of coal to boats, drastically saving costs and time. Since Bristol Borough's long established docks were accessible to the Delaware River, the town also became the Delaware Canal's southern (main distribution) terminal end.Both the Delaware and the Lehigh canals operated over 100 years, into the 1930s, and Bristol Borough saw most of that traffic once the canal was online; though some coal shipped from Easton. Canal traffic diminished as the Railroad age matured, but shipping bulk goods by water transport has decided economic advantages, so the canals lasted until the economic crash in the great depression. Consequently, later, the Pennsylvania Railroad would also connect to the anthracite flowing through the canals, to the riverine barge and boat traffic, and to provide rail depots servicing the manufacturies. Even before the canal, Bristol Borough was located along a main land route to New York City, Trenton, and New England so with construction of the canal and railroads, it became a major center of transportation and an even more attractive location for industry. By the 1880s Bristol Borough was home to many factories, including companies manufacturing wall paper and carpet. In World War I, the Bristol Borough docks had sufficient space for a shipyard to construct twelve building slips for the construction of merchant vessels. In 1917 Averell Harriman organized the Bristol Borough shipyards founding the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation (later called Merchant-Sterling) and given the U-boat menace, would land a contract to build 40 identical cargo ships for the war. The residential area that developed around the shipyards was soon named Harriman, Pennsylvania, and most of the housing built therein is still in use today. In 1922 Harriman was annexed by Bristol Borough. Most of the shipping was finished too late to enter World War I, but some of the shipyard's output was used post-war in relief and troop support missions. The majority of the contracts were canceled in 1919, and the ship yards rapidly became excess real estate. Between the world wars, the eighty-acres of the shipyard were let out to various concerns, including one area converted to building amphibious planes--the flying boats technology which was the heart and soul of long distance air travel until the technological advances theretofore the middle years of World War II.

In 1961, Bristol Borough gained national attention when the song \\"Bristol Stomp\\", by The Dovells hit #2 on the Billboard pop chart. The song remains a local favorite, and it is often played at ceremonies, parades, and sporting events. The Merchant Shipbuilding site returned to the news in the 1990s when the Bucks County Redevelopment Authority using state and federal funding targeted the area as a priority for urban redevelopment. Given its riverfront location, the old shipbuilding site was ranked highest in priority, and on 20 October 2000 various legislators and officials held a press conference at the former shipyard heralding the construction of the residential development already under way, known as the 'Riverfront North Project', and publicizing how derelict portions of the slipways were being removed. The project also established a park with four monuments celebrating the town's past in the redevelopment. Today the preserved elements of the shipyard, and other buildings once important in Bristol Borough's past service are enshrined and celebrated in the Bristol Historic District, Bristol Industrial Historic District, and tourism sites celebrating the town's history and rich ethnic diversity. Various annual festivals, in particular keep a multi-ethnic cultural identity alive and well. Historic sites in the town such as the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, Dorrance Mansion, General Stores and Mold Loft Building-Harriman Yard of the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, Grundy Mill Complex, Harriman Historic District, Jefferson Avenue School and Jefferson Land Association Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal is also designated a National Historic Landmark District.

History Originally, the Lenape Indians dwelled in present-day Chalfont. In 1683, William Penn signed a treaty with the local chief and parceled the land to the Free Society of Traders. In 1720, Simon Butler bought over 150 acres of land, including the \\"Village of Chalfont.\\" After the construction of his home and mill, Butler bought more than 400 more acres of land. Butler was a giant historical figure who acted as a legal and economic powerhouse in the area. After his death, the land was parceled to a number of people. Between then and 1901 Chalfont held several names, including Butler's Mill, Kungle's Tavern, Barndtsville, and Whitehallville. For many years, the most important building in the area was the tavern and public house, which has burnt down many times and now stands as the Pop Inn. During the Victorian era, a train-station was built which helped the community grow and brought about the construction of the many Victorian houses. In 1885, Chalfont established Forest Park. Forest park started out as a small picnic ground where music could be played. The appearance of the train station in Chalfont assured the park's success. However, as the park grew it became a small amusement park where local people could enjoy rides, a large swimming pool built in the 1930s, music (including string bands in the 1940s) and as the hosting ground for many company picnics. The park closed its doors forever in 1968.A History of Chalfont (1977) by the Chalfont Borough Bicentennial Committee George Eckhart later owned the Butler's mill which burned in 1835, he built a larger mill. Later Eckhart's son Martin inherited the mill and his other son inherited the farm. Part of the farmland included an woods of mostly oak locally known as Eckhart's Grove which was frequently used for dance parties, family gatherings, religious camp meetings and Sunday School picnics. Later, in 1885 the mill was owned by Philip B. Grove who leased it to Valentine B. Clymer and Matthew S. Cogan when it burned again and was never rebuilt. Another gristmill was built in 1793 not far from Bulter's mill first operated by men named Miller and Evans, later by Francis D. Hartzel, two of his sons succeeded him. After a fire in 1878, the mill was rebuilt and much of the machinery replaced. About 1761, Henry Lewis built a stone tavern operated by George Kungle during the Revolutionary period. Chalfont was known as Kungles Tavern. After Kungle, the tavern was later owned consecutively by James Morris, Lewis Morris, Abner Morris, then John Barndt from Tylersport. The village was then known as Barndtsville. William Stevens had a store on the south bank of the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and opened a post office in 1845. Chalfont was then known as Whitehallville. In 1869, the North Pennsylvania Railroad changed the name of the station to Chalfont. Sometime before 1885, the farm inherited by Charles Eckhart was purchased by Isaac Funk. On 27 June 1885, Funk opened the Forest Park on the grounds of the Eckhart's Grove. Guest speakers were attorneys from Doylestown J. Freeman Hendricks and John D. James. Music was provided by the Chalfont Cornet Band. On 20 June 1778, detachments of George Washington's army passed through the West Branch Neshaminy Creek and the North Branch Neshaminy Creek as they travelled from their camp at Valley Forge to Monmouth. Notable people Bobby Shantz, 1952 American League Most Valuable Player, operated a popular bowling alley and diner with baseball players Joe Astroth and Shantz's brother, Billy Shantz. The Pit-Catcher, aptly named after the combination of Bobby's career as baseball pitcher and Joe & Billy's careers as catchers, was a popular meeting place for Chalfont residents of all ages. The Pit-Catcher displayed Bobby's golden gloves, MVP trophy, and other baseball memorabilia.

Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999. The Churchville Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Resumption of passenger train service In the ensuing years since 1983, there has been heavy interest by both residents and politicians in resuming passenger service to Churchville. In September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began discussions with township officials along the railway, as well as SEPTA officials, about the realistic possibility of resuming even minimal passenger service to relieve traffic congestion in the region. Plans call for completing the electrification to Newtown, as originally planned in the late 1970s. PA-TEC's efforts have received overwhelming bipartisan support by both Bucks and Montgomery County officials, as well as at the state level, despite SEPTA's overall reservations. However, SEPTA has also confirmed they are willing to reestablish regular commuter service if strong political support exists in both counties.r8newtown.com. r8newtown.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-03.

It is located 15 miles (24 km) northwest of Trenton, New Jersey, 25 miles (40 km) south of Easton, Pennsylvania, north of Center City Philadelphia and southwest of New York City. As of the 2010 census, the borough population was 8,380.  History  Like most of the region, the area of what is now Doylestown was inhabited by the Lenape people until the arrival of the Europeans. Doylestown's origins date to March 1745 when William Doyle obtained a license to build a tavern on what is now the northwest corner of Dyers Road and Coryell's Ferry Road (now Main and State Streets). Known for years as \\"William Doyle's Tavern,\\" its strategic location, at the intersection of the road (now U.S. Route 202) linking Swede's Ford (Norristown) and Coryell's Ferry (New Hope) and the road (now PA Route 611) linking Philadelphia and Easton, allowed the hamlet to grow into a village. The first church was erected in 1815, followed by a succession of congregations throughout the 19th century.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, Doylestown Borough. A second inn, the Sign of the Ship was established in 1774, built diagonally across from the Doyle Tavern. Samuel Flack was innkeeper in 1778. Fountain HouseThe Fountain House, at the corner of State and Main Streets, was built in 1758 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. As the population of Central and Upper Bucks County grew throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, discontent developed with the county seat's location in Newtown, where it had been since 1725. Eight petitions with a total of 184 signers were submitted to the General Assembly, some as early as 1784, requesting the move of the county seat to Doylestown. Among the signers were Andrew Armstrong, John Armstrong, John Davis, Andrew Denison, Jesse Fell, Joseph Fell, John Ingham (of Ingham Springs), Michael Frederick Kolb, Zebulon M. Pike (of Lumberton), Samuel Preston, Robert Shewell, Walter Shewell, and Fulkerd Sebring. The General Assembly approved the move by an Act on February 28, 1810, and the first Court session was opened on May 11, 1813. An outgrowth of Doylestown's new courthouse was the development of \\"lawyers row\\", a collection of Federal-style offices. One positive consequence of early 19th-century investment in the new county seat was organized fire protection, which began in 1825 with the Doylestown Fire Engine Company. A post office was established on January 1, 1802. Charles Stewart, the first postmaster, carried letters to recipients in the bell- shaped crown of his high beaver hat as he walked about the village. When Stewart died on February 7, 1804, his son-in-law Enoch Harvey became the next postmaster. On October 9, 1804 Harvey advertised in the Pennsylvania Correspondent, published in Doylestown, of a list of letters remaining in the post office for Wm. R. Hanna, Esq., Newtown; Doct. Felix Robertson, Bucks County; Robert Wehir, Shamony, Bucks County; Robert A. Farmer, Esq., Birdsborough; Israel Childs, Buckingham. A bill to erect Doylestown into a borough was introduced into Legislature in February 1830, but failed, as well as a second attempt in the session of 1832. \\"An Act to erect the Village of Doylestown, in the County of Bucks, into a Borough\\" was passed and signed into law by Governor Joseph Ritner on April 16, 1838. Bucks County Courthouse An electric telegraph station was built in 1846, and the North Pennsylvania Railroad completed a branch to Doylestown in 1856. The first gas lights were introduced in 1854. Because of the town's relatively high elevation and a lack of strong water power, substantial industrial development never occurred and Doylestown evolved to have a professional and residential character. Pugh Dungan House During the mid-19th century, several large tracts located east of the courthouse area were subdivided into neighborhoods. The next significant wave of development occurred after the Civil War, when the Magill property to the southwest of the town's core was subdivided for residential lots. In 1869 Doylestown established a water works. The first telephone line arrived in 1878, the same year that a new courthouse was erected. 1897 saw the first of several trolley lines connecting Doylestown with Willow Grove, Newtown and Easton. A private sewer system and treatment plant were authorized in 1903. The Borough took over and expanded sewer service to about three-quarters of the town in 1921. In the early 20th century, Doylestown became best known to the outside world through the \\"Tools of the Nation-Maker\\" museum of the Bucks County Historical Society. Henry Chapman Mercer constructed the reinforced concrete building in 1916 to house his collection of mechanical tools and utensils. Upon his death in 1930, Mercer also left his similarly constructed home Fonthill and adjacent Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, to be operated as a museum. The home was left on the condition that his housekeeper be allowed to live there for the rest of her life. She lived there and gave tours until the mid-1970s. In 1916, Doylestown Country Club was established and still operates a private golf course and caddy program.http://www.doylestowncountryclub.com The County Theater in the Doylestown Historic District By 1931, the advent of the automobile and improved highway service had put the last trolley line out of business as Doylestonians used the automobile as the primary means of travel within the region. The Great Depression took its toll, as many grand old houses constructed a century earlier fell into disrepair. During the 1930s, the Borough also expanded its land area to the north by admission of the tract known as the Doylestown Annex. In the decade following World War II, Doylestown's business community boomed. During the 1940s, streets were paved for the first time in two decades and parking meters were introduced downtown in 1948. However, the postwar housing boom did not begin in earnest until the 1950s, when 550 new homes were built. The housing boom continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as more than 1,600 new homes were built during those decades and the Borough's population grew from 5,917 in 1960 to 8,717 in 1980. As with many small towns across the country, the growth of the postwar decades also brought a new competitor to the downtown business district, the shopping mall. By the 1960s, the toll could be seen in Doylestown by the numerous vacant buildings and dilapidated storefronts in the center of town. The Bucks County Redevelopment Authority responded with a federal urban renewal scheme that called for the demolition of 27 historic buildings. The local business community objected to such wholesale clearance and responded with its own plan called Operation '64, the Doylestown Plan for Self-Help Downtown Renewal. This private initiative was successful in saving Doylestown's old buildings and historic character, while improving business at the same time. One historic landmark that could not be saved was the 80-year-old courthouse and clock tower, which was replaced by the present county complex in the early 1960s. By the end of the 1980s, the downtown business district was again showing the toll of massive new competition from the latest wave of suburban shopping centers, as well as the recession that hit hardest in the northeastern states. In response, the Borough Council established a volunteer group of civic-minded representatives from business organizations, government, and the residential community to begin formulating plans for the downtown area in 1992. This effort resulted in streetscape improvements composed of cast iron street lamps and brick pavers, facade improvements and other beautification efforts, and the establishment of a Main Street Manager Program. Main Street As the 1990s progressed, the downtown area rebuilt itself largely by turning to an out-of- town audience. Doylestown had long been respected as a bucolic tourist destination. The gentry of Philadelphia and New York, including figures of the Manhattan theater and literary scenes, maintained country estates in the area and often summered there. The Mercer Museum, Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, and the local National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa brought a regular stream of short-term visitors through the area as well. With charitable support, the art deco County Theater was restored and reopened showing art- house fare, and a new main library and art museum were built around the ruins of the old stone jail, across the street from the Mercer Museum. An official \\"resort town\\" designation exempted the area from liquor license caps, and empty commercial space began to fill with a dense and vibrant nighttime scene of bars and restaurants. This development goes hand in hand with the broader development of the region. As the Philadelphia metropolitan area expanded from southern into central Bucks County, the fields and farms of the communities around Doylestown quickly began to sprout housing developments. This development brought thousands of people to the area, but the neighborhoods created often lacked longstanding institutions or discernible centers. Doylestown, more centrally located than the Delaware River border town of New Hope, which had traditionally served this function, was able to position itself as the regional center of culture and nightlife. Archival collection and community programming are two functions of the Doylestown Historical Society, established in 1995, whose mission is \\"to commemorate and preserve the history of Doylestown so that its people, places and events may long be remembered.\\" The Doylestown Historic District, Pugh Dungan House, Fonthill, Fountain House, Oscar Hammerstein II Farm, James-Lorah House, Mercer Museum, Moravian Pottery and Tile Works, and Shaw Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The population was 34,300 at the 2010 census. Portions of Fairless Hills and Levittown, Pennsylvania, are located in the township. Portions of Falls Township are called Morrisville and Yardley, due to the location of the Morrisville Post Office outside the Borough of Morrisville in Falls Township. As originally Chartered in 1692, the villages of Morrisville and Tullytown were part of Falls Township. Morrisville was granted Borough status in 1804. Tullytown was erected as a Borough in 1891. History Dutch settlements here were established as early as 1616. A number of colonists came to Falls Township before William Penn founded Pennsylvania in 1681, including William Biles. Fallsington is the only settlement of this period which has been in continuous use. Fallsington is an example of a crossroads village typical of the time. The Bucks County Courthouse, established in 1663, is said to have been located in Fallsington until it was moved to Bristol in 1705. The Friends Meeting, whose first meetings were held at the home of William Biles on Biles Island, found a site for a brick meeting house, built about 1690 in Fallsington on of land that had been donated by Samuel Burges. Also in 1690, Thomas Janney donated of land to be used as the Quaker burial grounds for Falls Monthly Meeting. William Penn donated a tract of , for a Falls commons. The Township itself was established in 1692. Numerous villages were located within the township, with Fallsington being the center of social and commercial activity in the township. Morrisville was another prominent village, until it was partitioned as a borough in 1804. Tullytown was also a village until it was partitioned as a borough in 1891. Villages and other place names, past and present, include Dogtown, Fairless Hills, Fallsington, Kildorpy, Kirkbridesville, Levittown, Morningside, Oxford Valley (located in both Falls Township and Middletown Township, Penns Manor, Penn Valley, Slickville, Tyburn, and Wheatsheaf.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, P1. The growth of Fallsington continued, with the construction of homes, an inn, public buildings, stores, and small craftsmen's shops. Until the construction of Fairless Hills and Levittown, it was the largest village in the Township, and functioned for many years as a commercial center. In 1682, William Penn began construction of his official residence, Pennsbury Manor. The site in Falls Township was chosen for its easy access to Philadelphia along the Delaware River. This island was gradually sold by Penn's heirs and the last original building was destroyed in 1864. In 1932, a small portion of the original site was purchased by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and reconstruction of Pennsbury Manor was begun. Pennsbury is now a historical site, open to the public. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The proximity of major transportation systems influenced much of the Township's development. The earliest of these was the Delaware River. The Township is located at the upper end of the navigable portion of the river. In 1686, the Provincial Council ordered the construction of the King's Highway, which ran from Philadelphia to Trenton along an existing Indian trail, through Bristol, Falls, and Morrisville. The King's Highway still exists today as U.S. Route 13, flowing closely the original configuration. Additional roads and turnpikes were built through the Township in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Other transportation systems were laid out through Falls Township in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Delaware Canal from Easton to Bristol was opened in 1832. A railroad line from Philadelphia to Trenton via Morrisville was built between 1833 and 1835. The rail line became part of Pennsylvania Railroad's main New York-Philadelphia line. The \\"West Trenton\\" cut-off of the Pennsylvania Railroad was built through the northern part of the Township at the end of 19th century. These rail lines now accommodate SEPTA, Amtrak, and CONRAIL passenger and freight between Philadelphia and Trenton.

The population was 1,003 at the 2010 census. History The Hulme family name, originally DeHoulme, is of Norman origin, dating from William the Conqueror. Members of the family originally settled in Lancashire, England, a branch later moved to Cheshire. The American family came from this branch. George Hulme, Sr. and George Hulme, Jr. immigrated to Bucks County from Tilston, Cheshire about 1700, purchasing land and settled in Middletown Township, some of the family later relocating to Buckingham. John Hulme, Sr., grandson of George, Sr., and his son, George Hulme, Jr. moved from Buckingham to Fallsington and ran a weaving business until 1796 when John, Jr. purchased land along the Neshaminy Creek and called it Milford. John, Jr. married Rebecca Milnor daughter of William Milnor.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, P199. Within a few years, the village built up to a number of dwellings, mills and other shops. The five sons of John, Jr. became a miller, two storekeepers, a tanner and a farmer. There was no public house, but John, Jr. many times opened his house to travelers. One autumn day in 1809, Josiah Quincy III stayed overnight on the way from Boston to Washington, D.C.. John, Jr. served a term in the Pennsylvania General Assembly and helped start a post office at Milford established on 1 October 1809, his son Isaac, the first postmaster. The village name then changed to Hulmeville. It is claimed that the General Assembly changed the name in honor of John, Jr. The first bank in Bucks County was organized in 1814, John, Jr. the first president. The bank moved to Bristol in 1830 and its name was changed to Farmers' National Bank. The Hulmeville Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

Langhorne eventually became the stagecoach transportation hub of Bucks County, transporting people between Trenton and Philadelphia and was then known as Four Lanes End, later known as Richardsons Corner. The first mention of Attleborough was recorded on a deed in the Recorder's Office, Deed Book 6, page 210, 7 November 1737. Isaac Hicks laid out a plan for \\"Washington's Square in Attleborough\\" in November 1783. Historian William J. Buck wrote \\"A resident of the place has informed me that this name is of local origin; that a William Richardson Atlee (son of Colonel Samuel Atlee of the Revolutionary Army), a lawyer and son-in-law of General Wayne, resided here about 1790 or perhaps a little earlier. A fire engine was ordered to be made, for which ¬£50 had been raised. When it was finished, word was sent from Philadelphia inquiring what name they wanted it called. Someone suggested that, as Mr. Atlee had been one of the principal contributors, it should be called after him. When the engine arrived, it was found to have painted on its sides Atleebury, which still to be seen. Shortly afterwards a post office was established here, when it was called Attleborough, a slight change from the original.\\" However, the post office was not established until 1 April 1806, Richard Croasdale, the first postmaster.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, Langhorne The village became known as Attleborough until 1876, when it was incorporated and named for Jeremiah Langhorne, an early resident of the area and former chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Upon the arrival of the railroad in 1876, residents of Attleborough and Hulmeville disputed over what the name of the station should be; the President of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, Franklin A. Comly, settled the matter by name the station Langhorne. A school of higher learning was established in 1835 named successively Minerva Seminary, Attleborough High School, Attleboro Academy and Bellevue Institute. Samuel J.

The population was 52,983 at the 2010 census. It is above sea level. Though not a municipality, it is sometimes recognized as the largest suburb of Philadelphia in PennsylvaniaJohn Fischer, \\"Philadelphia PA ‚Äì South Jersey Metro Area Population and Geography\\", About.com. Last accessed on March 24, 2006. (while Upper Darby Township, Lower Merion Township, Bensalem Township, Abington Township and Bristol Township are municipalities larger in size in the three surrounding Pennsylvania counties). Starting with land purchased in 1951, it was planned and built by Levitt & Sons. The brothers William Levitt and architect Alfred Levitt designed its six typical houses.  History  The majority of the land on which it is built was purchased in 1951. Levitt and Sons only built six models of houses in Levittown, all single-family dwellings with lawns: the Levittowner, the Rancher, the Jubilee, the Pennsylvanian, the Colonial and the Country Clubber, with only modest exterior variations within each model. The homes were moderately priced and required only a low down payment. Construction of Levittown began in February 1952, soon after completion of Levittown, New York, located on Long Island. Levittown, Pennsylvania was the second \\"Levittown\\" built by William J. Levitt, who is often credited as the creator of the modern American suburb. To speed up construction, Levitt & Sons perfected a 26-step rationalized building method that was essentially an assembly line type of home building. The house remained stationary, while the construction workers moved from house to house. Each worker had one task such as pouring slabs, framing, installing electric sockets or installing washing machines. This highly regimented process enabled Levitt's workers to produce a finished house every 16 minutes. Construction of the homes commenced in 1952 and when completed in 1958, 17,311 homes were built. What set Levittown apart from other developments at the time was that it was built as a complete community. Levitt & Sons designed neighborhoods with traffic-calming curvilinear roads, in which there were no four-way intersections. Each neighborhood had within its boundaries a site donated by Levitt & Sons for a public elementary school. Locations for churches and other public facilities were set aside on main thoroughfares such as the Levittown Parkway, likewise donated by the builder to religious groups and other organizations. Other amenities included Olympic-sized public pools, parks, \\"greenbelts\\", baseball fields and playgrounds, and a shopping center located in neighboring Tullytown borough that was considered large and modern at the time of its construction (and in fact was the largest east of the Mississippi). The first set of four sample homes were put on display in a swatch of land near the future Levittown Shop-a-Rama, and an estimated 30,000 people viewed them in that first weekend.server1.fandm.edu Aerial view of Levittown circa 1959 Residents (who are sometimes called Levittowners) were first expected to comply with a lengthy list of rules and regulations regarding the upkeep of their homes and use of their property. Two of these \\"rules\\" included a prohibition on hanging laundry out to dry on Sunday and not allowing homeowners to fence off their yards. These proved unenforceable over time, particularly when backyard pools became financially accessible to the working class and privacy concerns drove many to fence off their yards.server1.fandm.edu In the years since Levitt & Sons ended construction, three- and four-story \\"garden apartments\\" and a number of non-Levitt owner- occupied houses have been built in Levittown. Levitt & Sons would not sell homes to African Americans. Levitt did not consider himself to be a racist, considering housing and racial relations entirely separate matters. However, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) conditioned essential financing for this and similar projects on the restriction of home sales to those of \\"the Caucasian race\\", as stipulated in housing rent and sales agreements and deed covenants. This did not prevent Bea and Lew Wechsler, a Jewish couple from the Bronx, from connecting an African-American family to a neighbor who desired to sell his home. Levittown's first black couple, William and Daisy Myers, bought a home in the Dogwood Hollow section in 1957. Their move to Levittown was marked with racist harassment and mob violence, which required intervention by state authorities.Chris English, \\"Levitt had vision for community\\", Bucks County Courier Times, 1/11/2008 This led to an injunction and criminal charges against the harassers while the Myerses and their supporters refused to surrender and received national acclaim for their efforts. For instance, Daisy Myers has been hailed as \\"The Rosa Parks of the North\\", who helped expose the northern states' problems with racial inequality of that time. Daisy Myers later wrote a book about her family's experiences. She died Dec. 5, 2011, in York, Pa.York Daily Record/Sunday News. December 7, 2011. \\"Daisy Myers, civil rights pioneer, dies at age 86\\" The NAACP and the ACLU opposed Levitt‚Äôs racist policies, and the Federal Housing Administration threatened to refuse mortgages on his next Levittown. Levitt still refused to sell to blacks, and developed plans for yet another whites-only Levittown‚Äîthis one to be in Willingboro Township, N.J.‚Äîwhile fighting legal challenges in New Jersey courts. Ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his case.Jew vs Jew in Levittown The Forward, 13 April 2009 The community's otherwise placid exterior was again disturbed during the so-called suburban gas riots of June 1979 in the wake of the Camp David Peace Accords, which resulted in a second embargo by Arab oil-producing nations. The unrest occurred June 24‚Äì25, 1979, as lines swelled and tempers flared in the heart of Levittown at an intersection known as Five Points, a location surrounded by six service stations, two of which were severely damaged by vandalism in the riots. The two days of riots made national headlines and were mentioned (although not directly by name) in the draft of an address to the nation that was to have been delivered by President Jimmy Carter on July 5, 1979. A baseball team from Levittown won the Little League World Series in 1960. Levittown American beat an opponent from Fort Worth, Texas, to win the honor. The Levittown Shopping Center (known officially as‚Äîbut rarely called‚Äîthe \\"Levittown Shop-a-Rama\\"), located in Tullytown, was unusually designed. Two parallel strips of stores faced the parking lot with a courtyard that had green spaces, benches, and entrances to the stores. The center had one large anchor department store (Pomeroys, which was acquired by Boscov's) as well as staple stores of a growing suburban demand (JC Penney, Woolworth's, Sears-just hardware). The shopping center began a slow decline in the mid-1970s from which it never recovered with the building of the Oxford Valley Mall. The mall, located just north of Levittown, in Langhorne in Middletown Township, drew shoppers away from the older Levittown facility, given Oxford Valley's much larger size and enclosed shopping environment. In 2002, the redeveloped site of the Shop-a- rama was reopened as the Levittown Town Center. The completed facility contains of retail space. Of the five public pools built by Levitt & Sons and operated by the Levittown Public Recreation Association (LPRA), four were closed in 2002 with the exception of one located in the Pinewood section. LPRA Headquarters (and other landmarks) of this prototypical post-war suburb of sometimes mythic importance have been the focus of historic preservation efforts. Since 2002, studies have been underway to establish the Levittown Historic District. Since its inception in 1988, the Bucks County St. Patrick's Day Parade has been held in Levittown. Every year, the parade steps off from St Joseph the Worker Church, and proceeds two miles (3 km) on New Falls Road to Conwell-Egan Catholic High School. St Joseph the Worker Church has since been torn down.  Municipalities and sections  Levittown is not an incorporated place, though efforts in the early 1950s were made to incorporate. Some Levittown residents feared that incorporation would lead to higher taxes, by robbing the prospective municipality of a commercial tax base. Map of the municipalities, school districts and original sections of Levittown. The thick gray lines are municipal borders. Levittown's 41 neighborhoods (locally called \\"sections\\") are found in parts of four separate municipalities: * Bristol Township (including the sections of Plumbridge, Mill Creek Falls, Indian Creek, Goldenridge, Blue Ridge, Whitewood, Orangewood, Yellowood, Violetwood, Red Cedar Hill, Apple Tree Hill, Holly Hill, Crabtree Hollow, Oaktree Hollow, Greenbrook, Farmbrook, Dogwood Hollow, Junewood, Magnolia Hill, and most of Kenwood and Stonybrook, and a small part of Birch Valley) * Falls Township (including the sections of Vermilion Hill, Thornridge, Elderberry Pond, Will O Wood, North Park and portions of Pinewood, Lakeside and most of Birch Valley and 1 house in Magnolia Hill) * Middletown Township (including the sections of Deep Dale East, Deep Dale West, Highland Park, Twin Oaks, Forsythia Gate, Snowball Gate, Red Rose Gate, Upper Orchard, Lower Orchard, Juniper Hill, Cobalt Ridge and Quincy Hollow) * Borough of Tullytown (including small portions of Stonybrook, Kenwood, Pinewood and Lakeside). These neighborhoods' populations are counted by the U.S. Census Bureau as residing within Tullytown only, not the Levittown CDP. The names of the streets within each section uniformly begin with the same letter that begins the name of the section in question except for the section of Green Lynne, which was not constructed by Bill Levitt. This plan offers a good clue as to where any particular street might be located. \\"X\\" and \\"Z\\" are not used for section or street names. As there are more than 24 section names, \\"road\\" is used for street names in sections to the west of Edgely Road, \\"lane\\" is used in those section to the east. Sections are surrounded by a \\"drive\\" with the same name as the section. For example, the Pinewood section is circled by Pinewood Drive, while Snowball Gate is surrounded by Snowball Drive. Some sections have their drive broken into multiple parts, with similar names. Forsythia Gate has Forsythia Drive North and Forsythia Drive South. Almost all other roads or lanes in the sections connect on one or both ends to the drive of that section. In some sections, such as Goldenridge, the shape of the section prevents the drive from surrounding the section, or allowing all roads in the section from connecting to the drive. The drives of adjacent sections, are frequently connected with small connector streets. In addition, small connector streets are used to connect the section drive with a nearby main thoroughfare. The names of these small connectors typically start with one of the letters from the adjacent sections, and tend to have a name reminiscent of their purpose or their location. Some examples: Learning Lane connects Lakeside and Pinewood, and borders an elementary school. Short Lane connects Stoneybrook and Farmbrook. Not all small connector streets are named. Red Rose Gate, Forsythia Gate, and Snowball Gate are collectively known as \\"The Gates.\\" (These were the only sections without sidewalks so as to lend a more \\"executive\\" appearance to the neighborhoods.) Lakeside sits next to Levittown Lake. Thornridge has its upper half that sits on a ridge, that was found to have Thorn Bushes. Vermilion Hill is named after the color that the trees on its prominent hill turned in the Fall. Magnolia Hill is on a prominent hill. Mill Creek Falls is found next to a creek by the same name. Education Middletown residents are served by public schools run by the Neshaminy School District. Bristol Township public schools are managed by the Bristol Township School District. Falls Township and Tullytown Borough residents are served by the Pennsbury School District. Some students attend schools run by Roman Catholic, Lutheran, evangelical Protestant and Quaker organizations, in and around Levittown.  Geography  Levittown is located at . Levittown lies in the southern end of Bucks County (\\"Lower Bucks\\"), between Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey; Downtown Philadelphia (\\"Center City\\") is approximately away. It is part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area (an area also known generally as the Delaware Valley). It is adjacent to and nearly surrounds Fairless Hills, a suburban community more modest in scale, but that shares many of Levittown's characteristics. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which 0.5 km (0.59%) is water. It has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) bordering a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) and average monthly temperatures in the central CDP range from 32.2 ¬∞F in January to 76.1 ¬∞F in July.https://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/ The local hardiness zone is 7a.  Transportation  Levittown station on SEPTA Regional Rail's Trenton Line SEPTA Regional Rail serves Levittown to the south at its Levittown station on the Trenton Line, and to the north at its Langhorne and Woodbourne stations on the West Trenton Line. Interstate 295 (I-295) runs to the north and west of Levittown, connecting it with the suburbs north of Trenton. The Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-95) runs southwest of Levittown, connecting it with Philadelphia, the western suburbs, and the New Jersey Turnpike. U.S. Route 1 (US 1) runs to the north, carrying traffic directly into downtown Trenton. The nearest international airport is Philadelphia International Airport (Airport Code PHL), approximately southwest of Levittown. The nearest Amtrak station is just across the Delaware River in Trenton at the Trenton Transit Center, just over to the east. Though a steel mill once operated by U.S. Steel provided employment in Falls Township, many Levittowners have historically commuted by automobile or train to Philadelphia, some to Trenton, still others to more distant locales in as many as four states. Just over ten percent of employed Levittowners both live and work in the community.

However, Yardley Borough is much smaller by both population and land area, and is surrounded by Lower Makefield on three sides (the fourth side being the Delaware River). Lower Makefield Township is located in the Philadelphia Metropolitan Area (also known as the Delaware Valley), and its crime rate is the lowest in the metropolitan area, but it borders several towns in New Jersey to its north and east that are all in the New York Metropolitan Area. A plethora of residents commute daily to both cities. Lower Makefield borders the Delaware River which separates it from New Jersey. Bordering towns and cities in New Jersey are Hopewell Township, Ewing Township and Trenton (the capital of New Jersey). Additionally, it borders Upper Makefield Township, Newtown Township, Pennsylvania, Middletown Township, Pennsylvania, Falls Township, PA, and Morrisville, Pennsylvania, and as mentioned above, surrounds Yardley Borough on three sides. As of the 2010 census, the population of Lower Makefield Township was 32,559, not including Yardley Borough, and it ranked first in Pennsylvania for both median household and median family income (for places with a population over 10,000), however it ranked 78th overall in the United States (between Westfield, New Jersey and Moraga, California) for median household income, but non-census 2006 data indicates that since the 2000 census, it moved up to 31st for median household income (between Wellesley, Massachusetts and Rye, New York), and ninth for disposable household income, due to relatively low taxes and extremely low house prices compared to other peer, very-high-income towns. Living expenses are lower than in the bordering Ewing Township, New Jersey, though Ewing's median household income is nearly half and it has a crime rate many times higher. Lower Makefield is the largest municipality (by population) in North America without its own municipal court or post office. The municipal court serving Lower Makefield is in Morrisville (the town bordering the township to the southeast), and there are no plans to change the arrangements with Morrisville. The post office, while retaining the name of Morrisville, is located within Falls Township in which some of the township is served by the same ZIP code (19067). Previously Morrisville had a higher population, but with the growth in Lower Makefield over the past 30 years, Morrisville is now a much smaller place by both land area and population. Lower Makefield Township has been a top finisher in the MONEY Magazine and CNN/Money \\"Best Places to Live\\" rankings for the Eastern region of the United States in the under 100,000 population category. History The Dolington Village Historic District, John and Phineas Hough House, Amos Palmer House, Slate Hill Cemetery, Benjamin Taylor Homestead, and Village of Edgewood Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 18.3 square miles (47.4 km¬≤), of which, 17.9 square miles (46.5 km¬≤) of it is land and 0.4 square miles (0.9 km¬≤) of it (1.97%) is water. Past and present villages include Schammels Corner, and Woodside.MacReynolds, George, Place Names in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Doylestown, Bucks County Historical Society, Doylestown, PA, 1942, P1. Natural features include Brock Creek, Common Creek, Core Creek, Edge Hill, and Jericho Creek. Development and growth Lower Makefield has experienced explosive growth over the past decades; however, the housing crisis severely hit the township during the 2000s, and development slowed considerably, resulting in a slight population decrease. The decrease is credited to the many college-aged students leaving the township bound for college. The housing boom of the nineties resulted in a large increase in the adolescent population, who have since reached adulthood and left the township. Still many smaller housing developments and some corporate centers have been constructed since 2000, the latter especially the Stony Hill Road corridor around I-295, beginning with office complexes 1000 to 1040 Stony Hill Road in 1998, followed by 600 to 800 Township Line Road (at Township Line and Stony Hill), 777 Township Line Road (the first green building in Bucks County), and a new age-restricted housing complex under construction at 645 Stony Hill Road, near the township's retail district. However, the township has been well-planned and maintains a strong balance between growth and preservation, and is considered to be very desirable for the high quality of life it offers residents. On December 19, 2007, a committee was formed to work to bring a veterans' monument to Lower Makefield Township. On October 15, 2008, the Lower Makefield Supervisors unanimously approved designating the site of the farmers' market (known as Pocket Park) as a veterans' monument. On November 9, Pocket Park was officially renamed Veterans Square. The veterans committee has committed to not taking township tax dollars to build the monument and relies on contributions. The park will remain open space for use as a community farmers' market, playground, and monument. Demographics As of the 2010 census, the township was 87.7% Non- Hispanic White, 2.3% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 6.3% Asian, and 1.3% were two or more races. 2.4% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry. As of the census of 2000, there were 32,681 people, 11,706 households, and 9,388 families residing in the township. The population density was 1,821.8 people per square mile (703.4/km¬≤). There were 11,931 housing units at an average density of 665.1/sq mi (256.8/km¬≤). The racial makeup of the township was 93.32% White, 1.81% African American, 0.07% Native American, 3.72% Asian, 0.29% from other races, and 0.78% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.42% of the population. There were 11,706 households, out of which 40.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.5% were married couples living together, 5.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 19.8% were non-families. 16.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.13. In the township the population was spread out, with 27.6% under the age of 18, 4.2% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 27.8% from 45 to 64, and 10.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.1 males. The median income for a household in the township was $98,090, and the median income for a family was $106,908 (these figures had risen to $112,677 and $128,314 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $80,329 versus $47,138 for females. The per capita income for the township was $43,983. About 1.8% of families and 2.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.8% of those under age 18 and 3.7% of those age 65 or over.  Other  In addition to Lower Makefield and Yardley, postal ZIP code 19067 includes the borough of Morrisville, located southeast of Lower Makefield Township along the Delaware River. However, Morrisville is a distinctly separate town entity and has its own government, school system, police department, fire department, and sports programs. Lower Makefield is part of the Pennsbury School District, which is a top-ranked Blue Ribbon school district in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Pennsbury High School prom has become world-famous, and in 2004, the book, Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School by Sports Illustrated senior writer Michael Bamberger was released to critical and commercial acclaim. Based on the 2002‚Äì2003 school year, it follows a handful of students as they deal with the trials and tribulations of high school while centering on senior prom. Paramount Pictures, in conjunction with MTV Films, has optioned the rights to a film based on the book. In 2004, Grammy Award-winning multi-platinum John Mayer performed at the prom, following in the footsteps of bands Maroon 5, Michael Tolcher and Eve 6 who had previously performed at Pennsbury High School. In the September 11th attacks on the twin towers in New York City, Lower Makefield Township lost six residents, including the captain of United Airlines Flight 175, the highest number in Pennsylvania, which lost a total of 29 tower employees. This high concentration is most likely due to the large number of Manhattan commuters who live there. The Garden of Reflection Memorial in Lower Makefield went into development shortly after the attacks as a dedication to the 17 Bucks County residents who died in the attacks, and it also honors all of the 2,973 victims who lost their lives. The State of Pennsylvania has selected The Garden of Reflection as the Official Pennsylvania 9-11 Memorial, and it was formally dedicated on September 30, 2006. The $1.4 million memorial, designed by Yardley architect Liuba Laschyk, includes twin fountains representing the towers of the World Trade Center; a Walk of Remembrance, with a series of glass panels etched with the names of the 2,973 people who lost their lives in the 9-11 attacks; and a memorial rail etched with the names of the 17 residents from Bucks County who were killed. Each year the Yardley Inn hosts a fundraiser called \\"Cooking with the Chef\\" to raise additional funding for maintenance of the Garden of Reflection. On October 28, 2004, President George W. Bush visited with a crowd of 23,000 at Ruth Wright's Broadmeadows Farm in Lower Makefield during a campaign rally for the 2004 presidential election. Lower Makefield Township developed its own 18-hole golf course, Makefield Highlands Golf Club, which opened in 2004, and it is considered the only true links-style golf course in the Tri-State area. The club includes a par-72 course designed by Rick Jacobson, The Highlands Grille restaurant, Pro Shop, golf instruction, and full practice facility (driving range with both mat and grass areas, putting green, and chipping green with bunkers). Shady Brook Farm is a popular location for area residents, and is located in Lower Makefield. Shady Brook Farm has a large Farm Market and Garden Center, and hosts many events, including Pumpkin Fest and HorrorFest in the fall, Santa's Village and the Holiday Light Show during the Christmas season, and the Annual Easter Egg Hunt, as well as others throughout the year, including the Wine Concert Series and Apple Festival. In June 2006 at the 88th Annual Bucks County Fireman's Association Parade in Quakertown, PA, the all-volunteer Yardley-Makefield Fire Company won best overall fire department, as well as first place awards in the following categories: marine unit, deputy or chief's vehicle, aerial tower, over 1,500 gallon-a-minute engine, light rescue pumper, 1965 and older motorized apparatus, and best marching unit with music. In October 2006, the 15th annual YMS (Yardley-Makefield Soccer) Columbus Cup soccer tournament was recognized by Gotsoccer.com as a Premier Elite Tournament, which puts the YMS tournament at the same level as the Disney Showcase, Jefferson Cup, Bethesda, Dallas Cup, WAGS, Raleigh Shootout and the other most highly rated tournaments. The Annual Pennsbury Invitational Tournament is a softball fastpitch college showcase tournament, and in its 40 years has become one of the largest tournaments of its kind in the nation. It is considered to be one of the top NFCA (National Fastpitch Coaches Association) Recruiting Camp tournaments and draws top players and college recruiters from more than a dozen states as well as Canada. In 2016, 122 teams and more than 247 college coaches participated. The Slate Hill Cemetery, located at Yardley-Morrisville Rd. at Mahlon Dr. in Lower Makefield Township, is open to the public and is possibly the oldest burying grounds in Bucks County. It was established in 1690 and the earliest gravestone is dated 1698. There are a number of unmarked graves, for which dates are unknown. These unmarked graves are believed to be the final resting- places of a number of the early settlers in Lower Makefield. Washington Crossing Historic Park is located just over the Lower Makefield Township town line in the Washington Crossing section of Upper Makefield Township. From this site, General George Washington and men of the Continental Army and militia crossed the Delaware River on the night of December 25‚Äì26, 1776 and marched to Trenton, New Jersey. There they attacked and defeated Hessian troops quartered in and around the village. This surprise attack and victory set the stage for Washington's subsequent victories at the Second Battle of Trenton and Princeton. The Crossing and the Trenton/Princeton campaign have become known as the Ten Crucial Days ‚Äî a campaign that saved Washington's army from defeat, allowing them to fight another day and achieve ultimate victory.

The population was 45,436 at the 2010 census. Many sections of Levittown, Pennsylvania, are located in the southern end of the township. The municipality surrounds the boroughs of Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, Penndel and Hulmeville; much of the township beyond Levittown uses Langhorne, Pennsylvania as a mailing address. Also located within the township is Core Creek Park. The township also has many acres of protected woods, the largest being the woods behind Neshaminy High School. The Neshaminy Creek flows through these woods. There are also a few protected farms, significantly that of Styer's Orchards, which was saved from turning into the site of 632 homes in the late 1990s.

Natural features include Core Creek, Lake Luxembourg in Core Creek Park, Edge Hill, Langhorne Water Works Run, Neshaminy Creek, and Newtown Creek. History Middletown Township began as a farming community, with close proximity to trading towns such as Langhorne and Newtown. There are not many significant historical places located in the township apart from homes and farms constructed in the late 18th century. Middletown Township was sparsely populated before 1950: there were only a little more than 2,000 people in 1930, compared to about 46,000 in 2010. Then William Levitt began his second Levittown, which included land of four municipalities, including that of Middletown. Twelve developments were constructed in the township, with the majority of them containing hundreds of homes. This marked the first planned residential development in the township. Meanwhile, Langhorne Terrace was being constructed out of the Neshaminy Woods. During this decade, the township grow by over 440%, or more than 20,000 new residents. As the decades worn on, hundreds and hundreds of acres of pristine woods, rolling countryside, and productive farms continued to be swallowed into homes and businesses. In the 1970s, the Oxford Valley Mall was constructed, and at the time was named the country's largest mall for a short time. Growth continues to this day; however, Middletown has taken action. The township preserved hundreds of acres now known as Core Creek Park, which includes the sprawling Lake Luxembourg. Many woodlands and a few farms have also been saved. The township has transformed from a bucolic, rural area to a highly desirable and well-planned community, with low crime and an award- winning school district. This is why the township is still seeing a growing population, attracting many out-of-state residents and international migrants. Lake Luxembourg in Core Creek Park. Middletown also benefits from its convenient location, in the near center of the county: Middletown is close to almost any other municipality nearby, including the cities of Philadelphia, Trenton, and Princeton. Both I-295 and U.S. 1 pass through the township, offering its residents an easy commute, with the exception of rush hour traffic, which too has been greatly reduced and continues to be in ongoing road projects.

Like much of the Delaware Valley, Middletown's immigrant population is skyrocketing. With many new, upscale housing developments, many of the households were bought by foreign-born residents. Middletown's immigrant population largely consists of Indians, Koreans, Mexican Americans and Russians. However many others too, such as Chinese, Hispanics, and Arabs, have growing numbers. Aside from European immigration, Middletown's immigrant population has mostly arrived after 1990. Politics The township was once dominated by the Republican Party like most of Bucks County, due to a more bucolic, rural feel. However, after years of growth, Democratic Chairman John Toth and migration of peoples from Democratic areas, the area has been trending Democratic rapidly, along with Bucks County. The Neshaminy School Board and Middletown Township Board of Supervisors both lack a one party dominance, which used to be mostly or all Republican. In the 2006 mid-term elections, Ed Rendell (Governor), Bob Casey (U.S. Senator) and Chris King (Pennsylvania's 142nd Representative District), who are all Democrats won the township. The heavily battled election between Mike Fitzpatrick and Patrick Murphy for the 8th Congressional district was split 50/50 like much of the area. Education Middletown Township lies within the Neshaminy School District. Students living within township boundaries may attend either Albert Schweitzer Elementary School, Herbert Hoover Elementary School, Pearl S. Buck Elementary School, Tawanka Elementary School, or Walter Miller Elementary School for grades K-4, depending on where they live. Carl Sandburg Middle School and Maple Point Middle School serve students in grades 5-8, and Neshaminy High School serves students in grades 9-12. Cairn University, a private religious university, is partially located within township boundaries. Retail Oxford Valley Mall The Oxford Valley Mall is at the center of a vibrant commercial retail area. The area surrounding the mall has grown and has changed significantly in the past twenty years. Mainly car dealerships and car automotive shops were once the only structures around the mall. Today over 30 car dealerships remain, but many have been demolished for the new waves. Over 40 restaurant chains are in the vicinity, along with many major retail stores, such as Target, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Staples, and Barnes & Noble. A surplus of furniture stores are also located here, along with various hotel chains, a major hospital, and office buildings. Many homes have been constructed around the mall, the oldest being Langhorne Gardens, a branch of Levittown, Pennsylvania. Many newly constructed townhouses, condos, and large single-family homes have been built. Traffic has become a major concern. Nearby U.S. 1 and Interstate 295 allow commuters to congest the mall area roads, along with the surplus of residents in the area. Over 400,000 people reside less than ten minutes from the mall, plus the many commuters from nearby New Jersey. Many major construction projects are planned for the major access roads. There is a significant, and fast-growing foreign presence in the area. As thousands of people from other continents have settled near the mall, there is a wide variety of ethnic food, churches, and superstores in its vicinity. Housing Middletown has a large mix of housing construction and time periods, which range from the fifties to new construction. Almost all the development that occurred in the fifties were the Levittown sections. Housing ranges from cheap single-family housing to exorbitant single-family living, and also townhomes, condos, assisted living, apartment complexes, deluxe apartment complexes, and 55+ housing. There are no trailer parks in Middletown. There are a handful of homes constructed before 1950, even a few dating back to the 18th century, however they are individual homes and scattered, due to Levittown being the first planned development. The most significant area with scattered housing periods is the area of Parkland. Houses date from every decade of the 20th century, and the 21st. Parkland has the lowest land value and family incomes than any other area of Middletown.

It is located just below the falls of the Delaware River opposite Trenton, New Jersey. The population was 8,728 at the 2010 census. History The earliest known settlement in what is now Morrisville, was a trading post of the Dutch West India Company operating from 1624 to 1627 on an island in the Delaware River. In its early days, the area was known as Crewcorne and was a part of Falls Township. Later, one of the first ferries to cross the Delaware was established at the site. By the late 18th century, a settlement was forming at the ferry crossing then known as Colvin's Ferry. The settlement incorporated into a borough in 1804, taking the name of Morrisville, after Founding Father Robert Morris. In that same year, the first bridge built across the Delaware connected Morrisville to Trenton. The Gershom Craft House, Summerseat, and Trenton City/Calhoun Street Bridge are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Summerseat is also designated a National Historic Landmark. Morrisville is also home to Graystones, the historic site marking William Penn's first Pennsylvania land purchase from the Lenni Lenape Indians. Morrisville was once considered for the Nation's Capital. Robert Morris campaigned behind the scenes to establish the new capital at the ‚ÄúFalls of the Delaware,‚Äù preferably on the Pennsylvania side. Today that is seen from Park Avenue in Morrisville, just atop of the 30-foot tall flood control dike. The Delaware River is viewed from here and just below is the famous Falls of the Delaware, for which Falls Township was named. Geography Morrisville is located at (40.207458, -74.779918). It is part of a geographical salient that is mostly surrounded by New Jersey. Originally a village located in Falls Township, until it was partitioned as a borough by the Pennsylvania Legislature in 1804, Morrisville is bordered by Falls Township to the south, Lower Makefield Township to the north and the Delaware River to the east. Its name is the default city name in the 19067 ZIP code, which covers an area that includes Yardley, Lower Makefield, Morrisville, and part of Falls Township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.1 km¬≤), of which 1.8 square miles (4.6 km¬≤) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.5 km¬≤) (10.15%) is water. U.S. 1 traverses Morrisville and crosses into New Jersey via the Trenton‚ÄìMorrisville Toll Bridge. There are several parks within Morrisville's borders, and the Delaware Canal State Park runs near the eastern border of both the town and Pennsylvania. Located between the Calhoun Street Bridge and the Lower Trenton Bridge (Trenton Makes) is Williamson Park, home to Morrisville Little League and many community events.

The population was 2,528 at the 2010 census. New Hope is located approximately north of Philadelphia, and lies on the west bank of the Delaware River at its confluence with Aquetong Creek. The two-lane New Hope‚ÄìLambertville Bridge carries automobile and foot traffic across the Delaware to Lambertville, New Jersey on the east bank. New Hope's primary industry is tourism.  History  Joseph Pickett (circa 1918) The first train to New Hope, 1891 New Hope Train Station, 1945 Main Street in New Hope New Hope is located along the route of the Old York Road, the former main highway between Philadelphia and New York City. It was generally regarded as the halfway point, where travelers would stay overnight and be ferried across the Delaware River the next morning. The section of U.S. Route 202 that passes just north of New Hope is still named York Road, and the original route is now known as Bridge Street (PA 179). New Hope was first called \\"Coryell's Ferry\\", after the owner of the ferry business. The current name came into use following a fire in 1790 that destroyed several mills in the area; their reconstruction was considered a \\"new hope\\" The night prior to George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River, he is said to have lodged in New Hope. He destroyed the ferry so the British could not follow him, and after the battles of Trenton and Princeton, when British troops were sweeping the area for the American forces, there was no response when they rang for the ferry. The British assumed the town was sympathetic to the Colonial forces and shelled the town. Several of the older structures in the town still claim to have unexploded British ordnance lodged in their roofbeams. Historic former residents include James A. Michener and Aaron Burr. The North Pennsylvania Railroad finished construction of their New Hope Branch in 1891, later being taken over by the Reading Railroad. Passenger service to Philadelphia's Reading Terminal as well as all other passenger activity was terminated in 1952 from Hatboro, also the end for electrified track, and New Hope. Between 1952 and 1966, only freight trains were seen entering and leaving New Hope, mostly to deliver paper pulp for the Union Camp Paper Corp. and to deliver sand and gravel to James D. Morrissey Materials Co., a cement company and a division of James D. Morrissey, Inc. In 1966, the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad was formed and bought of track from New Hope southwest to Ivyland. Scenic tourist excursions started the same year. Freight service to New Hope was then handled by the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad. In 1972, SEPTA, who by then took over Reading Railroad's passenger operations, extended the electrified route to Warminster, where the current interchange for both SEPTA and NHRR is. Freight service to James D. Morrissey Materials Co. ceased sometime in the late 1970s and to Union Camp Paper Corp. in 1985. The New Hope and Ivyland Railroad continues to provide scenic tourist excursion passenger trains between New Hope and nearby Lahaska. In 1983, NBC network anchorwoman Jessica Savitch and her boyfriend drowned after their car overturned into the Delaware Canal. The canal passes by Odette's Restaurant, where the couple had dined on a rainy evening when visibility was poor and two warning signs were missed. In 2004 and 2006, New Hope was flooded when the Delaware River overflowed its banks. On both occasions, the downtown businesses reopened within several days. Compared to the Great Flood of 1955, the 2004 and 2006 floods did not cause severe damage or fatalities.

The borough is located at the confluence of the Delaware River and Aquetong (Ingham) Creek, which begins its two-mile course in neighboring Solebury Township at Ingham Springs, the most productive spring in Southeastern Pennsylvania. The name Aquetong comes from a Lenape word meaning \\"spring in the bushes,\\" while Ingham refers to Samuel D. Ingham, an industrialist, congressman, and advocate of the canal that would run through the town. Near its end in New Hope, the creek forms a scenic millpond and waterfall near the Bucks County Playhouse, a former mill. The surrounding area features low, rolling hills, and consists largely of preserved forest and farmland. Many people whose mailing addresses are in New Hope actually live outside the borough in Solebury.

The population was 2,248 at the 2010 census. It is located just west of the Trenton, New Jersey metropolitan area, and is part of the larger Philadelphia metropolitan area. It is entirely surrounded by Newtown Township, from which it separated in 1838. State Street is the main commercial thoroughfare with wide sidewalks, shops, taverns, and restaurants.  History  Newtown was founded by William Penn in 1684. Newtown was one of several towns that Penn had organized around Philadelphia to provide country homes for city residents and to support farming communities. It was the county seat of Bucks County from 1726 until 1813, when it was replaced by a more central Doylestown. After his December 26, 1776 morning march to Trenton, and before the Battle of Princeton, General George Washington made his headquarters in Newtown. Newtown was incorporated on April 16, 1838 and has been enlarged three times since. In 1969 Newtown's entire central business district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This designation was largely due to Newtown's historic clock tower. Newtown is enhanced by unique boutiques, colleges, cuisine, a climate for industry, Pennsylvania's most popular state park (Tyler State Park) and a Heritage Walk that traces the very steps of George Washington. The Law School Admission Council is headquartered in Newtown Township. As a result, many American lawyers have heard of Newtown. The oldest operating movie theater in America is Newtown Theatre at 120 North State Street. Newtown is known for its wealth of history. One of the most noted former residents of Newtown was painter Edward Hicks (1780‚Äì1849). He lived in Newtown for over forty years with his family, where he was able to own his own business. Newtown has an established historical society called the Newtown Historic Association. The Newtown Hardware House has been in continuous operation for over 130 years, which ranks as the longest tenure for any single business in Newtown.Rounsavill, Brian E. Newtown Past and Present. Ed. C. David Callahan and Paul M. Gouza. Newtown: The Newtown Historic Association, Inc., 2006. The Half-Moon Inn, Newtown Creek Bridge, Newtown Friends Meetinghouse and Cemetery, Newtown Historic District, Newtown Presbyterian Church, and George F. Tyler Mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Newtown is located at (40.228208, ‚àí74.932338). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 0.6 square miles (1.4 km¬≤), all of it land. The Newtown Creek, a tributary of the Neshaminy Creek, runs North to South and is the western boundary between the borough and the township of Newtown.  Transportation =Highways State Street runs through Newtown's main commercial area and intersects with Washington Avenue at the borough's infrastructural center. Pennsylvania Routes 532, 332, and 413 converge in and around Newtown. The Newtown Bypass runs to the west and south of the borough and connects to Interstate 295 to the east. On April 22, 2014, by act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, it was renamed Brian S. Gregg Memorial Highway. Officer Gregg ‚Äì a Newtown Borough police officer ‚Äì lost his life in the line of duty on September 29, 2005. Passenger trains Until January 14, 1983, Newtown was served by SEPTA's Fox Chase/Newtown Line commuter rail service. At that time, service was suspended because of failing train equipment. Since then, there has been constant talk of reinstating service because of recent strong population growth in the surrounding area; however, this has not materialized. There was also a movement under way to convert the unused rail corridor into a bike trail that has thus far been unsuccessful because of resistance in surrounding communities. To date, SEPTA has no plans to restore train service. The entire issue of resuming commuter service has been a political albatross almost from the day the trains stopped. Newtown remains the victim in all the political squabbling that has amassed over the years, as they have always given strong support of returned commuter service and have the most to gain. Author Joseph Schwieterman commented in 2001 that \\"few communities experiencing the loss of service have engaged in as protracted a dialogue about bringing back their passenger trains as Newtown. The continuing impasse has left many transit advocates skeptical that the borough will ever be accessible by rail again.\\" However, in September 2009, the Southampton-based Pennsylvania Transit Expansion Coalition (PA-TEC) began discussions with all townships along the rail line, as well as SEPTA officials, about possible resumption of passenger service.Train support Bucks County officials and Newtown residents overwhelmingly supported PA-TEC's efforts, making it official in December 2009 when the Newtown Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting the full restoration of passenger service; neighboring Montgomery County officials are also supportive of re-thinking the rail corridor as well. Toll Brothers built the \\"Newtown Station\\" development east of the station site.ryvenco.com The nearest station to Newtown is Woodbourne station on SEPTA's West Trenton Line. Bus SEPTA currently serves Newtown with SEPTA Suburban Bus Route 130, which runs to nearby Bucks County Community College and south to the Langhorne station along SEPTA Regional Rail's West Trenton Line and Frankford Avenue and Knights Road in Northeast Philadelphia. Trails Newtown Township, which surrounds the borough, has a system of bike and walking trails that lead to the borough in several places, including from Tyler State Park.  Education  Newtown is in the Council Rock School District. While the district serves many towns in Lower Bucks County, Newtown Township is home to Council Rock High School North, Newtown Middle School (formerly Newtown Junior High), Goodnoe Elementary School, Newtown Elementary School, and the former Chancellor Street School, which now acts as the administrative building for the district. The only private school in the township is St. Andrews Catholic Education Center. George School, though associated with Newtown, is mostly in Middletown Township, and Newtown Friends School, though it bears Newtown's name, is located entirely in Middletown Township. The township is also the site of Bucks County Community College's main campus. La Salle University and Holy Family University also have satellite campuses on the Newtown Bypass.

The area, originally inhabited by the Lenape Indians, was settled by Thomas Langhorne, an English Quaker preacher, and by Henry Paulin, a Quaker Yeoman, on land grants from William Penn. Penndel remained a farming region until 1876 when the Philadelphia Reading Railroad began service, and the Langhorne train station was established. In 1878 Thomas Eastburn & Co. advertised 130 Building Lots in the area calling it \\"The Eden of Bucks County.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, PA Sat, Jul 13, 1878 Page 5 Slowly individual homes and small businesses were built in close proximity to the railroad, and the town expanded from there.

Personal buckets and ladders were used to extinguish the fire. Less than a month later, on July 4, 1890, a committee appointed by Perkasie Borough Council met to form the Hope Fire Company. On September 8, 1890, the Hope Fire Company met at Groover's Hall (517 Chestnut Street) and adopted a constitution and by-laws; 32 members were present. At the same time, Borough Council turned over to the fire company a hand pumper purchased from Newtown Fire Association, and a hose cart purchased from Philadelphia with of hose. One month later the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad presented the Fire Company with a tire for a steam locomotive driver wheel for use as a fire alarm. This was installed in a cupola of the Groover building (now in front of Silverdale Fire Company). Industry Between 1920 and 1950, a factory at 815 Chestnut Street produced millions of hand stitched major-league baseballs through a Hubbert/Spalding contract. The building was subsequently converted into the Senior Citizens Center, which has since moved to the neighboring borough of Silverdale. It is now scheduled to be converted to six two-bedroom condominiums by Habitat for Humanity of Bucks County to provide a new start for families in need. The organization plans to utilize green building techniques while preserving the building's historical exterior. 1988 fire and recovery On June 26, 1988, about 15 percent of the town, including many historic buildings, were burned down in what became known as The Great Perkasie Fire. This massive fire was started by two 12-year-old boys who were playing with a lighter near the coal bins behind the Shelley & Sons lumberyard at Seventh and Market Streets. The fire was fought by about 300 firefighters who came from over 50 fire companies in three counties. Among the historic buildings lost were the American House and the Moyer-Kantner Funeral Home, both dating from 1870; the Herstine Building; and the J.G. Moyer building. The latter was photographed for the cover of the July 7, 1945 edition of The Saturday Evening Post, an artistic rendition of a Fourth of July parade by John Falter. Despite the size of the fire, no fatalities were reported.Kracz, Ed. \\"The day Perkasie burned.\\" The Intelligencer, June 22, 2008 Immediately after the fire, a group of concerned business owners, residents and borough officials formed a Downtown Restoration Task Force. The Task Force was given the name of the Perkasie Olde Towne Association. This group was the forerunner to the Perkasie Towne Improvement Association (PTIA). The PTIA along with Perkasie's local government were responsible for the three-phase town improvement plan that was completed over the next five intervening years. The PTIA's focus was to oversee the reconstruction of not only the area of the town center affected by the fire, but also other retail and residential areas in the central part of the Borough. As a result of these efforts, streetscape enhancements of decorative street lights, underground utilities, new sidewalks with decorative brick borders were built and new benches, trash receptacles and street trees were placed throughout the focus area.

Infrastructure=Transportation The borough is bordered on each side by state roads: PA 563 to the north; PA 313 to the east; PA 113 to the south; and PA 309 to the west. PA 152 runs through the center of the borough. The nearest Interstate Highways are I-476, I-276 and I-78. The borough's nearest airport is Pennridge Airport, a public general aviation airport with one -long runway. It is just north of the center of town, on the other side of the East Rockhill Township border. There is currently no public transportation in Perkasie. Perkasie was once served by the Reading Railroad's North Penn Division, also known as the Bethlehem Branch, which was once part of the North Pennsylvania Railroad. The line is now owned by SEPTA, which ended passenger service in the early 1980s. The last SEPTA-operated Bethlehem Line Philadelphia-bound passenger train passed through Perkasie on July 29, 1981. Conrail subsequently continued freight operations out of Lansdale up to Quakertown until the mid 90s. The East Penn Railroad, formally known as East Penn Railway (EPRY), leased a portion of the railroad from SEPTA, saving the line from abandonment from Telford through to Quakertown. SEPTA recently issued a formal proposal to perform maintenance on the line and restore passenger service, either installing catenary for electric trains, or using diesel trains connecting to the Lansdale/Doylestown Line in Lansdale. The project would take at least five years. As of late 2009, unmarked freight cars, particularly covered hoppers, are stored along the southbound track in Perkasie between Market Street and Park Avenue, from Park Avenue to the Old Bethlehem Pike Bridge, and so on to Meetinghouse Road in Telford. East Penn through Perkasie with ex-Conrail B23-7 3153 runs about two to three times a week, passing through Perkasie to Telford, and again passing through Perkasie while returning to Quakertown. The trains usually run between 10:00am and 4:00pm during the week. Utilities The Perkasie Borough Electric Department provides electricity to the borough. The electric department originated out of a need to improve street lighting, using a generator before a power plant was built in 1900. In 1947, with the growth in demand for electricity, the borough kept the electric distribution system but begin receiving electricity wholesale from Pennsylvania Power & Light (now PPL Electric Utilities). A modern substation serving the borough's electric system was constructed in 1995. The Perkasie Borough Electric Department currently purchases its electricity wholesale from multiple sources. The borough's Public Works department provides trash collection and recycling, while natural gas service is provided by UGI Utilities.

The population was 868 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Philadelphia- Wilmington-Camden Metropolitan Statistical Area, despite being so closely connected to the Lehigh Valley. History Benjamin Riegel founded Riegelsville. The original, and now historic, Riegelsville Inn that he built in 1838 still stands. This historic stone inn has offered food and lodging to Bucks County travelers for over 160 years. The community was named for the Riegel family, as early landowners; they established paper mills across the river in New Jersey. The pictured \\"Riegelsville Hotel\\" is in Riegelsville, NJ not Riegelsville, Pa. The Riegelsville Inn in black and white With the completion of the Delaware Canal in 1832, the lands along the Delaware River attracted great industrial development. The movement of coal, a major important product of the area, brought capital & investment to Easton. Boats carried coal, stone, iron, crops and goods from the mills along the 60 miles from Easton to Bristol. Along Canal Street grew one of the largest industrial manufacturing centers of America during the 1830s and 1840s. Easton continued to prosper as a center for industry, manufacturing, commerce, and culture at the Forks of the Delaware and along the great rail lines. Between 1904 and 1926, Riegelsville was served by electric passenger and freight trolleys of the Doylestown & Easton Street Railway Company. Riegelsville prospered when the Delaware Canal opened in 1832 with warehouses and factories lining its banks. The canal closed in 1931 after 99 years of service and was replaced by the railroads. Today, Riegelsville is a peaceful and quiet town. Woods and fields border the Delaware Canal; remnants of crumbling stone foundations along its banks are reminders of a busy past.

The population was 4,249 at the 2010 census. It is a suburb of Philadelphia in the Pennridge School District. History Bird's eye view from 1894 Sellersville was founded in the early 18th century. It was centered on a major road known as Bethlehem Pike that connected Philadelphia to Bethlehem and the rest of what was then far Western Pennsylvania. The town was very small and was called Sellers Tavern. Its most notable feature was a large inn. The present Washington House in Sellersville, however, was not Sellers Tavern. The town grew slowly over the years until the Industrial Revolution. In the 1860s the North Pennsylvania Railroad was built, running parallel to Bethlehem Pike: this stimulated the growth of light textile industries and brought a wave of population growth. The East Branch of the Perkiomen Creek runs through the town which connects it to an adjacent town of Perkasie. This creek was dammed in the early 20th century creating a small body of water known as Lake Lenape. Along the length of the lake a park was built on Perkasie and Sellersville lands. In the 1920s and 1930s this park housed a carousel, a roller coaster and several other amusements. The railroad brought hundreds of people from Philadelphia in the summer time, and it became a well known vacation spot for blue collar city workers. In August 1938, Deutschhorst Country Club, a summer retreat created by the German American Bund, a Pro-Nazi organization moved to the area after purchasing a 40 acre ranch outside of the town. The group used the area as a summer camp where family functions and activities were pursued in addition to political rallies. As World War II approached, the club sought to distance itself several times from the Nazi cause in local newspapers and was reported as \\"almost abandoned\\" from a lack of use by 1940. FBI agents were reported to have been watching the club grounds and visitors were reported to have covered their license plates in order to avoid being identified as a Bund member. In September, 1939 - shortly after the start of World War II, leader of German American Bund - Fritz Julius Kuhn, gave a speech to gathered members of the German American Bund and associated groups such as the World War I German Veteran league known as the Kyffhauser Bund, declaring that with the start of the war Adolf Hitler would \\"lick the world\\" in the new conflict. The camp would eventually be closed after the dissolution of the German American Bund on December 8th, 1941 - after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. https://hsp.org/blogs/fondly-pennsylvania/nazi-party-sympathizers-in- philadelphia-before-the-war-part-1 https://hsp.org/blogs/fondly- pennsylvania/nazi-party-sympathizers-in-philadelphia-before-the-war-part-2 http://buckscountyadventures.org/cloak-and-dagger-mailbag/ The town was also home to the Radium Company of America, which was the largest uranium milling facility in the world at the time.

Today the town is still relatively small, sandwiched in between a ridge line and the larger town of Perkasie. The center of town still runs along Bethlehem Pike which is now called Old Route 309. The Washington House has recently been restored to become an upscale restaurant. Next door to the restaurant was a livery stable, which was converted into a theater (later a movie theater) in 1894. It has since been restored, and reopened in 2001 as Sellersville Theater 1894- a popular live music venue. The creek is still dammed but only the carousel in Perkasie remains of the amusements. The textile industry has long moved out of the area and Sellersville has become mainly a residential town for people working in the many urban centers that are only a short commute away. Grand View Hospital, Bucks County‚Äôs first hospital, has provided residents of Bucks and Montgomery counties with comprehensive healthcare services since 1913. The town is surrounded on three sides by open country and spread out housing developments. The local firehouse provides various activities throughout the year, including a carnival in the summer. The Holiday House Pool and Recreation Center becomes a hotspot for people to escape the heat during the summer as well. There are various businesses along Main Street, one being the Washington House, which provide some jobs as well, but largely the town remains a residential area. There is a Sellersville Museum off of Main Street which displays different exhibits every month. The Teller Cigar Factory was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

Service was \\"temporarily\\" suspended due to a lack of ridership along the line. The train station has since been restored and is now a private residence. In the ensuing years (particularly post-1995), there has been interest in resuming passenger service by Bucks County officials; however, neighboring Montgomery County officials are staunchly opposed to it. Though rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, patronage remained light. The replacement bus service was far slower and less convenient than the train service it replaced, resulting in the shuttle bus being very unpopular. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a suitable replacement for a rail service.

Inc., an on-site management company. Community-wide elections are held every November to fill vacant positions on the VSCA Executive Board for the ensuing calendar year. In an effort to ensure continuity of operations, board positions overlap and span two year terms. There are also several committees that report to the Executive Board, such as the Architectural Control Committee, which assists the Executive Board in approving or denying requests to make additions and alterations to townhomes by owners.

It is 13.7 miles north of Philadelphia and had a population of 32,682 according to the 2010 U.S. census. History The town was called Warminster Township as early as 1685, before its borders were formally established in 1711. It was originally part of Southampton Township, which was founded in 1682 by William Penn. Warminster was named after a small town in the county of Wiltshire, at the western extremity of Salisbury Plain, England. Warminster, Pennsylvania was mostly settled by English and Scotch-Irish colonists after William Penn received a grant of land in the area from King Charles, II. It was the site of the Battle of Crooked Billet during the Revolutionary War, which resulted in a resounding defeat for George Washington's colonial troops. Warminster's Craven Hall is included in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Warminster's most significant historical figure was William Tennent, an outspoken religious leader and educator. Warminster began as a small farming community and agriculture was central to most of its history. The first steamboat model was designed and made here in Warminster township. John Fitch and Steven Pagano were the inventors and designers of the model steam boat that was tried out on the Delaware river and successfully floated. During World War II, the U.S. Navy acquired an industrial site here from the Brewster Aeronautical Corporation in 1943. The Center initially served as a weapons development and airplane testing facility. The Naval Air Warfare Center, previously called the Johnsville Naval Air Development Center and then the Naval Air Development Center, operated in Warminster from World War II until it closed in 1996. As recently as 1955, the township had no residential subdivisions and only one housing complex, Lacey Park on Street Road. In the 1960s the naval site became adapted as a training center for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs. The facility also developed a prototype \\"black box,\\" best known as the indestructible recorder of cockpit conversations and information in the event of a crash.

It is located near the east border of Hatboro, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The population was 4,124 at the 2010 census. History This neighborhood, built in 1943, formerly served as the civilian housing area for the long-defunct Brewster Aeronautical Corporation, established in 1941, while the area was still referred to as Johnsville. It later became the Naval Air Development Center and was finally known as the NAWC, Aircraft Division, Warminster prior to its being decommissioned and closed by the US federal government in the mid-1990s. The community was previously named Lacey Park, for Pennsylvania Militia General John Lacey, who fought during the American Revolutionary War at the Battle of Crooked Billet, which took place near the neighborhood. It is still referred to colloquially as Lacey Park by local residents. In the 1960s, Lacey Park was renamed Warminster Heights, although to this day many older area residents prefer the former name when referring to the neighborhood. Deserved or not, it had a somewhat odious reputation among the local population as it was a lower class, blue collar, low-rent public housing district during the 1960s and '70s up to the mid-1980s. The housing project had over 10,000 health and safety violations and was known as the \\"worst suburban slum in Pennsylvania.\\" It suffered from a high crime rate and a high rate of house fires. Built in the 1940s by the US federal government, most of the housing units consisted of cinder block on slab construction, in units of four dwellings per structure (similar to Philadelphia row homes), in either one or two stories, generally with central heating via coal or heating oil furnaces with mostly electric appliances. Between 1957 and 1975 the housing units were under private ownership; in 1975 the Redevelopment Authority of Bucks County took over and managed the properties, and in 1986 ownership was turned over to a housing cooperative called the Warminster Heights Home Owners' Association. The housing cooperative began renovating the units following the assumption of ownership. The neighborhood has worked hard to repair its image. It has been known over the years for instances of murder and other violent crimes. The Park, as it is often referred to, has a history and longstanding association with poverty, alcohol abuse, and constant drug activity.

The population was 14,437 at the 2010 census.  History  Warwick was formed by petition February 13, 1733 by eighteen residents. It was named after a town in central England and was the home to many Scots-Irish Presbyterians. In 1819 the Township lost over half its territory to the north when Doylestown Township was established. History is closely tied to several existing structures, i.e. the Neshaminy Presbyterian Church and the Moland House. The Neshaminy Presbyterian Church is one of the earliest religious associations in Pennsylvania dating back to 1726. The Moland House was General George Washington's headquarters when 11,000 Continental Army troops camped in Warwick Township from August 10, 1777 until August 23, 1777 while on their way to the Battle of Brandywine. The encampment stretched along both sides of Old York Road, on the slope of Carr's hill to the north; both sides of Bristol Road from Mearns Road to Meetinghouse Road. General Washington held a \\"Council of War\\" with his four Major Generals and six Brigadier General in the Moland House. There are nearby historical homes such as the Warwick Furnace Farms, which was owned by a prominent ironmaster Samuel Van Leer. While in Warwick Township the American flag that was designed by Betsy Ross was presented to General Washington and Warwick Township was the site where the American flag was first flown. It was here the Marquis de Lafayette and Count Casimir Pulaski joined the American Revolution and distinguished themselves soon at the Battle of Brandywine and for many years thereafter in the fight for American freedom from England. The Bridge Valley Bridge and Moland House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography The township is located 20 miles north of Philadelphia and 10 miles west of Trenton, New Jersey.

History Wrightstown's first settler was John Chapman, who emigrated from England in October 1684, with his wife and children and settled on land which was part of the original William Penn Grant. According to legend, they first lived in a \\"cave\\" or \\"sod hut\\", probably on what is now Penns Park Road. Twin boys were born in their dwelling during the first winter, originating a long life of descendants, among whom was Henry Chapman Mercer. Although the first dwelling no longer exists, there are seven houses in the Township which were the homes of second and third generation Chapmans. William Smith, who arrived the year after the Chapmans, built a log house which still stands on Mud Road. In addition to the Smith house, there are 140 other houses in the Township which are at least 100 years old. The boundaries of the Township were established by 1692. A square mile in the center, in the present Penns Park, was reserved for parkland. However, in 1719, this was divided among the surrounding property owners. In addition to its basically rural character, much of the Wrightstown Township's charm is due to its five villages: Penns Park, Pineville, Rushland, Wrightstown and Wycombe. Each village at one time contained its own post office, a rather distinctive facet of life in the Township. Today, all but the Wrightstown Post Office remain, with home delivery available to approximately 50% of the Township through the Newtown Post Office. A small portion of the township is served with home mail delivery through the Furlong Post Office in neighboring Buckingham Township. Other past villages include Anchor and Chain Bridge. The Penn's Park General Store Complex, Penns Park Historic District, William Smith House, Waldenmark, Isaiah Warner Farmstead, Wrightstown Friends Meeting Complex, Wrightstown Octagonal Schoolhouse, and Wycombe Village Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

History Yardley was founded by William Yardley, who emigrated to America in July, 1682 with his family. He made an agreement with William Penn, before leaving England, to buy for ten pounds. A survey was completed in October 1682, and the area William Yardley settled was called \\"Prospect Farm.\\" It was located just outside the present Yardley Borough. William Yardley died in 1693, and his family in 1702-1703, possibly of smallpox. The family's burial plots are located in Slate Hill Cemetery, one of the oldest Quaker burial grounds in the state. Video A nephew, Thomas Yardley, came to America in 1704 to settle the estate and never returned to England. He opened a ferry line which started operating in 1710 from Letchworth Avenue, the lower boundary of the village, and landed in New Jersey further downstream. This was an important link between West Jersey and the three roads leading to Philadelphia by way of Falls, Langhorne and Newtown. The Yardley family occupied the land for more than 150 years. When Yardley was founded there were already small settlements at nearby Burlington, Bristol, and Falls Ferry. Yardley began to develop into a village about 1807, and by 1880 had a population of 820. Early industries included a spoke and handle factory, sawmill, felloe factory, plate and plaster mill, and two flour mills. The first post office, established in 1828, used the name \\"Yardleyville.\\" The name became \\"Yardley\\" again at the time the Reading Railroad came through the area in 1876. During the American Civil War, Yardley was a station for the Underground Railroad, an escape route for slaves. Known hiding places were under the eaves of the Continental Hotel (now the Continental Tavern), in bins of warehouses on the Delaware Canal (completed in 1862), and at the General Store (now Worthington Insurance). At Lakeside, the yellow house facing Lake Afton on N. Main St., one brick-walled cellar room is also thought to have been a hiding place. Yardley Borough was incorporated on March 4, 1895. The Train Collectors Association, which now boasts worldwide membership of 30,000 individuals, was founded in Yardley in 1954.http://www.tcamembers.org/about/index.htmtitle=TCA Members: About the TCA The former Bridge in Yardley Borough, Washington Crossing State Park, and Yardley Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Transportation A SEPTA Regional Rail train on the West Trenton Line stops at the Yardley station The Philadelphia to Bound Brook, New Jersey, two-track main line of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad passed through (and stopped) at Yardley, It crossed the Delaware River on a still standing massive stone viaduct called the West Trenton Railroad Bridge. This line now is SEPTA Regional Rail's West Trenton Line and operates also as a CSX freight line called the Trenton Subdivision. SEPTA trains along the West Trenton Line stop at the Yardley station. Prior to the 1950s, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's New York City-bound trains from Washington, D.C., (Royal Blue, Capitol Limited, National Limited, Ambassador, and others) used the Reading's trackage to Bound Brook as did the Reading's Crusader. runs through Yardley adjacent to the Delaware River, heading south to Morrisville and north to New Hope and beyond and is a scenic byway. heads west from PA 32 in Yardley and leads to Newtown. Historic timeline * 1876: The North Pennsylvania Railroad first constructed the railroad through Yardley in 1876 and was leased by the Reading Railroad for 100 years, starting in 1879, to become part of the Reading's eventual line to Bound Brook, New Jersey. * 1843: The United States Postal Service changed the name of the town to Yardley from Yardleyville. This was to avoid confusion with the New York City/Philadelphia train line that made a stop here and at Yardville, New Jersey. * 1895: Yardley is incorporated as a Borough within Lower Makefield Township. * 1955: Flooding caused by hurricanes Connie and Diane wiped out the bridge to New Jersey. * 1961: Scudder Falls Bridge opens, just outside the borough. * 1976: The historic but now bankrupt Reading Railroad becomes part of CONRAIL along with other bankrupt eastern railroads. * 1984: The first DMV office opens in Yardley Boro PJ'S Auto Tags * 1996: Due to student overpopulation of Quarry Hill Elementary School on Quarry Rd near Creamery Rd, Afton Elementary School was constructed in the adjacent lot. * 1997: A notable jewelry store in Yardley proper suffered damage from a fire.

The Connolly Brothers established a machine shop, and the Twohils opened another. W.J. Harshaw came after the oil discoveries and opened a general store. Woods & Markwell came in early. T.G. Campbell carried on business here for a number of years, and H.M. Caldwell and J.A. McKallip established a general store in 1877. In the fall of that year the decrease in oil production and the smallpox epidemic, which carried away five persons, almost depopulated the village and district. A small band of Indians continued to reside here for a number of years, and at intervals the fathers of the little tribe would revisit the settlements. The young Native men, many of whom were doubtless born in the area, frequently returned to hunt deer or panther. The borough was incorporated in 1901.

In 1803 John and Samuel Cunningham became the first settlers in the village of Butler. After settling in Butler, the two brothers laid out the community by drawing up plots of land for more incoming settlers. By 1817, the community was incorporated into a borough. The first settlers were of Irish or Scottish descent and were driving westward from Connecticut. In 1802 the German immigrants began arriving, with Detmar Basse settling in Jackson Township in 1802 and founding Zelienople the following year. After George Rapp arrived in 1805 and founded Harmony, larger numbers of settlers followed. John A. Roebling settled Saxonburg in 1832, by which time most of the county was filled with German settlers. Butler incorporated into a city in 1918.

Rail and automobile  In its heyday, the city of Butler was a \\"Steel Belt\\" manufacturing and industrial area. It remains home to an AK Steel factory. In 1902, the Standard Steel Car Company opened one of its largest railcar manufacturing facilities in Butler. It was here that some of the first all- steel rail cars were built. Diamond Jim Brady, the legendary financier, gourmand and gemophile, established the Standard Steel Car Company in 1902, which merged with the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1934, creating Pullman- Standard, a monopoly that was eventually broken by the government. About 2,500 workers produced 60 steel-bed railroad cars per day in 1902. Eastern European immigrants were lured to the area in the early 20th century with the promise of reliable jobs, which offered company housing and a company store. The company constructed a baseball park which was the home of a New York Yankees farm team. The steel workers of Butler made artillery and naval shells during World War II. The Pullman-Standard plant closed in 1982, but was purchased in 1984 by Trinity Industries. Trinity Industries left the factory in 1993, and the factory was completely demolished in 2005. The site is now occupied by a vacant strip mall, as well as the Butler Transit Authority inter-modal facility. In 2011 the BTA moved a covered hopper rail-car, built in 1974, to the bus terminal in recognition of the former Pullman-Standard plant. The American Austin Car Company (1929‚Äì1941) was headquartered in the area. Later the firm changed its name to American Bantam Car Company. Bantam was an early producer of small fuel-efficient vehicles through the 1930s. In 1940, lead engineer Karl Probst led Bantam design team to create what later was termed the iconic WWII Jeep. Sizeable military contracts eventually went to Willys and Ford, as the Bantam factory had floundered. Today, a controversial monument stands near the courthouse commemorating Bantam's \\"creation of the Jeep\\". Butler is home to one of the early Ford dealerships, established in 1918 and still extant. At one point, the Rainbow Rubber Company, in the late 1930s, made \\"Rubrtoy\\" replicas of Oldsmobiles along with many other rubber toys. In the 1950s, Butler became one of the first cities to install bells at crosswalks, a common practice today. Pedestrians could cross in either direction. The city was linked to Pittsburgh via Mars, Pennsylvania, in 1907 by the Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway, and to Evans City in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, both interurban trolley lines. The Mars route closed in April 1931, followed by the Evans City line on August 15, 1931, with the trolleys replaced by buses. Like most of the region, by the end of the 1970s, the local economy changed dramatically. Manufacturing virtually ended and good-paying jobs became scarce. The city now accepts state and government money to sustain itself.  Geography  Connoquenessing Creek flows through Butler, Pennsylvania.

However, by the turn of the 20th century, Callery became a prosperous railroad community with the completion of the Northern Subdivision, which connected with the P&W; line in Callery. The Northern Subdivision ran from the junction to the village of Ribold outside of Butler. This new connection turned Callery into a major hub for the B&O; Railroad, and for the next three decades it would be called Callery Junction. By the 1930s, a new connection was completed at Eidenau which eliminated the sharp curves and grades to Ribold. Soon after, traffic on the old connection ceased, and Callery Junction was no more. Trains from the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad still pass the small borough today, but the junction has been gone for almost eighty years.

The population was 4,170 at the 2010 census. History Connoquenessing is known as the area in which George Washington was famously shot at by his French Indian guide. On 27 December 1753, just past Muthering Town, a Native American allied with the French (French Indian) joined Washington and Gist as a guide. The guide's behavior became wearisome to Washington and Gist. As the party was approaching a clearing the Indian stopped, turned on Washington and Gist and fired his musket. What could have been a fatal shot was taken no more than 15 steps away, missing both. They subdued the attacker and released him by 9 o‚Äôclock that evening. They then built a fire as if staying for first light, but Washington and Gist continued on throughout the night on the Venango trail (now part of Franklin Road and Route 528). Almost certain the French Indian would follow their tracks at day break, they thought it best to get a head start. A monument pillar stands at the Connoquenessing Municipal building dedicated to this incident.

Retrieved on 2013-07-17. Geography Cranberry Township is located in western Pennsylvania (40.70996 N, 80.10605 W). Although it is often described as a residential suburb of Pittsburgh, less than a 30-minute drive to its downtown, Cranberry is also a regional economic and employment center in its own right. The number of people commuting into the township to participate in its 20,500-member workforce is considerably larger than the 9,200 township residents who commute to work outside Cranberry. According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 22.8 square miles (59.1 km2), 0.004 sq mi (0.01 km2), or 0.02%, of which is water.[1] Surrounding neighborhoods Cranberry Township has seven borders, including Jackson Township to the north, Forward Township at its northeast corner, Adams Township to the east, Seven Fields to the southeast, the Allegheny County townships of Pine and Marshall to the south, and the Beaver County township of New Sewickley to the west. Government The township's policy-making body is its five-member, at-large board of supervisors who are each elected to serve six-year terms. , the composition of the board was entirely Republican:[3] * Richard M. Hadley, Chairman (R) * Mike Manipole, Vice chairman (R) * Bruce Mazzoni, (R) * Bruce Hezlep (R) * John Skorupan (R) The township has a full- time police force of 30 officers, a volunteer fire company supported by a dedicated property tax, and an independent Emergency Medical Service organization that coordinates with the township's other emergency services. Cranberry is also the local supplier of fresh water and wastewater treatment, both of which are funded by ratepayers. Cranberry owns, maintains and offers programs in three major municipal parks (Cranberry Park, North Boundary Park, and Graham Park) as well as an open-air waterpark and an award-winning 18-hole municipal golf course, Cranberry Highlands Miracle League of Southwestern Pennsylvania has a ballfield in Graham Park with an adjacent fully accessible playground. Cranberry Public Library operates out of the township's Municipal Center building, as do its Early Education Preschool Program, its aerobics programs, and its administrative offices. Demographics , the U.S. Census estimated the township's population at 30,458 in 10,769 households. The population density was 1,231.1 people per square mile (400.2/km¬≤). The racial makeup of the township was 94.4% White, 1.2% African American, 2.8% Asian, and 1.1% from two or more races. Cranberry is a family-oriented community. , 71.98% of Cranberry's male population 15 and older was married; the corresponding figure for females was 69.45%. The national rates were 53.97% and 51.02%, respectively. 44.5% of the township's households had children under 18 living with them and household size averaged 3.22. The median population age was 35.96. The median income for a household in the township in 2017 was $103,276 Approximately 2.5% of families were below the poverty line.  History  In 1753, George Washington, then 21, was working for the Virginia Colony's British governor and hiked through what is now Cranberry Township along the Venango Path. His assignment was to deliver a message to the commander of the rival French Fort LeBoeuf that ordered the French to withdraw from northern Pennsylvania. The commander rejected the order, precipitating the French and Indian War, which the British and their colonies ultimately won but at a great cost. When the township was originally chartered in 1804, it had a substantially larger area than it has now. In 1854, its boundaries were redrawn, reducing Cranberry from 81 to 25 square miles. Although the Iroquois, the Delaware, and Seneca nations had hunted and fished in the Cranberry area for centuries, the first European settlers, Mathew and William Graham, arrived in 1796. There, the brothers both acquired 200 acres of land that Benjamin Franklin had designated as part of the nation's Depreciation Land program, used to pay American Revolutionary war soldiers with land, which was abundant, rather than in cash, which was scarce. Over the following decades, the Graham family and Samuel Duncan, another early settler, opened a tavern, a distillery, a sawmill, and a grist mill. In 1806, Graham began the community's first church, the Plains Church, now the Plains United Presbyterian Church, which remains an active congregation. Descendants of the Graham family continue to reside in the community, which is sometimes confused with the homonymous Cranberry Township in Venango County (formerly Fairfield Township, founded 1806), a much smaller community away.[6] Prior to World War II, Cranberry Township was primarily an agricultural community, without a traditional downtown. Although small stores, taverns, mills and implement- making shops had operated in Cranberry for years, its development did not really accelerate until the Pennsylvania Turnpike's western section was completed in 1951, with an exit at Route 19, Cranberry's main arterial road, followed by the 1966 opening of I -79, which crossed the Turnpike at the township's southern end. With support and encouragement from the nonprofit Cranberry Industrial Development Corporation, formed by the township's board of supervisors in the mid-1960s, a local industrial park was created and quickly filled. It was soon followed by other business and light industrial park facilities catering to companies seeking inexpensive land with easy highway access.[Reflections of Cranberry Township. Helen Goehring Dewald. Cranberry Township Historical Society. 2005]. The 1989 opening of I-279 further accelerated the township's growth, shortening the drive time to Downtown Pittsburgh to less than half an hour. The township's name derives from the wild cranberries that were abundant along the banks of Brush Creek prior to the 20th century. For centuries, the cranberries had attracted deer, which, in turn, attracted Native American hunters. However, drought and farming combined to eliminate the township's namesake fruit by the 1880s. Today's Cranberry Township also contains several smaller, unincorporated census-designated places including Ogle, Fernway, and Fox Run, neighborhoods whose names continue to appear on some online maps. The Cranberry Township Historical Society, formed in 1984, was created to collect and preserve relics of the community's early local history; a permanent display of early artifacts is currently under construction in the township's Municipal Center.  Transportation  The north‚Äìsouth Interstate 79 and the east‚Äìwest Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) both run through Cranberry Township. U.S. Route 19 and Pennsylvania Route 228 are also important arterial roads in the municipality. All four roads are connected by an interchange, a $44.3 million PennDOT/Pennsylvania Turnpike venture, which opened in 2004 to provide direct, non-stop connection between those heavily traveled roads. Access to the northern terminus of Interstate 279, an important artery that serves as a direct expressway to Downtown Pittsburgh from the north, is located south of the township. Between 1908 and 1931, Cranberry Township was served by an interurban trolley line to Pittsburgh as well as to points north. No other rail service has ever been available in the township, and no regularly- scheduled transit service is offered there. Today, motorized transportation in Cranberry is provided only by private vehicles.  Economy  Exterior of the Cranberry Mall There are more than 1,000 businesses in Cranberry. The township's economic development has been balanced, involving a variety of industries. Ordinances affecting its commercial growth have been enacted under guidance from comprehensive plans adopted by the township's board of supervisors in 1977, 1995, and 2009. Beyond its emergence as a major regional retail and hospitality center, the primary engine of Cranberry's local economy has been its growing family of corporate, industrial and research organizations. There are currently around 20,500 jobs in Cranberry. Far more people commute into Cranberry for work than commute from the township to work at jobs elsewhere. Cranberry is home to major operations of McKesson Automation-Aseynt, PPG Architectural Coatings, Alcoa-Kwaneer, MSA Safety, Gatan and Westinghouse Electric Company. It is also the base for a growing number of technology startups as well as for professional, manufacturing, finance, retail and hospitality businesses. Good highway connections, low taxes, eight major business-industrial parks, and a well-educated workforce have helped make Cranberry Township a major employment center. Cranberry residents, as well as consumers from communities throughout the region, are served by a growing assortment of national chains and local merchants operating at shopping malls in the township. Among them are Cranberry Mall, Streets of Cranberry, Cranberry Commons, Freedom Square, Cranberry Crossroads, Towne Center Plaza, and Cranberry Shoppes as well as a number of smaller shopping centers. More than 220 retail businesses operate in the township. A satellite campus of the UPMC Health System, UPMC Passavant Hospital-Cranberry, is located at the intersection of Routes 19 and 228. Cranberry's largest employer is Westinghouse Electric Company, whose headquarters relocated from Monroeville, Pennsylvania, to Cranberry Woods Business Park in 2009. More than 3,000 people work at the campus at Cranberry; its business is focused on the design, construction, maintenance and decommissioning of nuclear power plants worldwide. Westinghouse was a division of the Toshiba Corporation of Japan until 2018 when it was purchased by Brookfield Business Partners. In August 2015, the Pittsburgh Penguins and UPMC opened a new hockey practice and sports medicine facility in Cranberry near the PA 228/I-79 interchange. The UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex is named for former Penguin and current team co-owner Mario Lemieux. As of December 2018, Cranberry Township continues to expand with the new additions of Burgatory, Chipotle, and other store fronts to the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex area along with a new hotel. There are plans to further expand the area with new restaurant developments and new retail space. Outside of the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex area, Cranberry Township has added over 20 new businesses, with more currently under construction.http://www.twp.cranberry.pa.us/1504/Just-Opened ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Populated places established in 1796 Category:Townships in Butler County, Pennsylvania Category:1796 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"131591","text":"Donegal Township is a township in Butler County, Pennsylvania, United States.

History  The site that is now Evans City was for a long time a favorite camping ground for Native Americans, who named the creek that ran through it Big Beaver Run, while the French knew it as Casse-cou-anse or \\"Breakneck Creek\\", a name adopted by travelers between Fort Duquesne and Fort Machault, and by the English-speaking pioneers of the original township of Connoquenessing. From 1804 to 1836, the location was often called \\"Boggs' Mill\\", and in later years \\"Evansburg\\", after Thomas B. Evans, who purchased and rebuilt the original Boggs' Mill. In 1880 it was a little hamlet, credited with a population of 68 people. In 1890, there were 637 persons enumerated in the census, and at the beginning of 1894, it was generally credited with a population of approximately 1,000. In October 1878, the railroad was completed to Evans City; the first freight to be delivered was a new boiler to replace one which had exploded in the Sutton flouring mill. The bank of J. Dambauch & Son was in existence. The residence for the pastor of the German Lutheran church, the Henry Young store and other houses were completed, and the new railroad town showed increased signs of business activity. A council appears to have had control of the place at that time, as mention is made of street improvements and of the appointment of Z. T. Weise as chief of police. The burning question at the time was the location of the railroad depot. Once the location for the depot was chosen, it became a rather famous decision, creating the nation's only railway depot that was built over water. Spanning the Breakneck Creek on iron beams for support, the picturesque railway station was an iconic landmark of breathtaking architecture. Due to its age and growing structural instability, and against much popular protest, the station was finally demolished in the early 1980s rather than restored. Later the school question occupied the attention of the people. Ultimately the schools were placed under the control of the Jackson Township board after a resolution by the Evans City school building committee was withdrawn. In 1882 Evans City was incorporated as a borough. At the charter election held September 22, of that year, Edward Dambach was chosen burgess. The first churches of record in the area were as follows: Amana Baptist Church was organized March 22, 1820. Late in 1881 some 33 members withdrew to form an independent Baptist church. The United Presbyterian Church was founded about 1837. Services were held in the frame school-building in the old United Presbyterian cemetery, until about 1842, when a brick house of worship was erected. Owing to the age of the old building and its unsafe condition, a new house of worship was considered necessary and the present building was erected. This is a frame house , well furnished, with pastor's study, standing on the old church lot on Main Street. It was dedicated in April 1888. St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran is a contemporary of the \\"German Lutheran and Reformed Congregation\\". In 1849 it was known as the \\"Reformed Church\\", then united with the German Lutheran, and so continued until August 2, 1853, when fifteen of the thirty families forming the united congregation held distinct Reformed services in the church built in 1849-50. The Presbyterian Church was founded in 1882 out of the Old Plains Church congregation. St. John's United Christian Church was organized in August 1888. The Methodist Episcopal Church was dedicated on October 27, 1889. The old class at Caleb Richmond's, in Forward Township, later consolidated with the Brownsdale class, claimed some members from the Breakneck region, as well as did the Duthill class in Cranberry township to form the original members. The Evans City Cemetery and the borough became popularly known as the place where the 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead was filmed. The film's director, George A. Romero, also shot his 1973 film The Crazies in and around Evans City.  Economy and environment  Landfill gas collection from capped landfill area Seneca Landfill, near Evans City, captures methane, which it converts to renewable natural gas at its on-site methane recovery high-BTU plant, LEGO-V. The landfill produces .34MW of electricity, and enough renewable energy to heat over 3,800 homes per year. This reduces the county's methane emissions, and provides an alternative to fracking for shale gas.  Government  Evans City Borough is represented by a municipal government of one Mayor and five Council members. Currently Dean Zinkhann serves as the Mayor of Evans City, and the council has the following members: Cheri Deener- Kohan, Norm Nelson, Brad Rubinosky, and Diana Zoelle.

History In December 1753, George Washington and Christopher Gist came through the area. They were shot at somewhere between present-day Evans City and Ellwood City (the exact location is unknown), through a region above the forks of the Ohio known as Mutheringtown or \\"Murdering Town\\".From Logstown to Venango with George Washington, W. Walter Braham; George Washington at Fort Necessity, John P. Cowan (1955) In 2003, the borough commemorated the event as part of the 250th Anniversary Commemoration of the French and Indian War. Rapp's Seat overlooking Harmony and Connoquenessing Creek Harmony was founded by the pietist Johann Georg Rapp and his Harmony Society in 1804. George Rapp came to America from W√ºrttemberg, Germany, in 1803 in search of land for his followers that was free from the religious persecution they faced in Germany. He was searching for a place for his followers to worship, farm and put into effect Rapp's communal religious teachings. In 1804, two groups of Harmonites purchased a tract of land in Butler County, Pennsylvania. They formally established the Harmony Society in 1805 and lived in Pennsylvania for about 10 years before selling the Harmony property in 1814 to Abraham Ziegler, a Mennonite, and moving west to Indiana Territory, where they built the town of Harmony on the Wabash River (now New Harmony, Indiana).William E. Wilson, The Angel and the Serpent: The Story of New Harmony (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1964), p. 37-38. In 1824, they moved back to Pennsylvania, this time to Economy (now Ambridge). The settlements were economically successful, producing many goods in a clothing factory, a sawmill, a tannery, and from their vineyards and distillery. A hotel was also run in Harmony. In Economy, the group aided the construction of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, established the Economy Savings Institution and the Economy Brick Works, and operated the Economy Oil Company, Economy Planing Mill, Economy Lumber Company, and eventually donated some land in Beaver Falls for the construction of Geneva College. In 1869, Mennonite craftsmen built the stone wall around the Harmonite cemetery in Harmony with a unique revolving stone door. The society exerted a major influence on the economic development of western Pennsylvania. But since the group chose to adopt celibacy, they eventually died out when John S. and his wife Susanna C. Duss, the last surviving leaders of Harmony Society, died in 1951. The Mennonite community in Harmony lasted until around 1904, by which time the town was selling more and more individual plots. Still extant is an old Mennonite meeting house on a hill near Harmony that was built in 1825. Harmony's history, particularly that of the Harmony Society, is preserved at the Harmony Museum, operated in the town by Historic Harmony, Inc. On a hill in Harmony, situated above Connoquenessing Creek sits a \\"seat\\" of stone (actually a rock formation). This seat was said to be used by Rapp (Rapp's Seat) to watch over the commune and its members in their daily lives. Thanks to local Boy Scout Troop 457 of Zelienople, a set of steps were built leading up to the seat as part of an Eagle Scout project for Christopher Van Arsdale of Harmony.Christopher Van Arsdale - trail to Rapp's Seat.

It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area in the western part of the state. It was founded in 1832 by F. Carl Roebling and his younger brother John A. Roebling as a German farming colony. The population of Saxonburg was 1,525 as of the 2010 census. The city was first named \\"Germania\\" and \\"Sachsenburg\\" before its name was anglicized to the present one. After Roebling returned to his engineering career, he developed his innovation of wire rope in a workshop here. He became known for his design of suspension bridges, including the most famous one, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.  History  Founded in 1832 by Friedrich Carl Roebling and his younger brother John A. Roebling, the frontier farming community was initially called \\"Germania\\". This was changed to \\"Sachsenburg\\" and later anglicized to Saxonburg. Roebling had emigrated with his brother Carl and a group of pioneers from Prussia (Germany) in 1831 to flee political unrest and oppression. The two men, along with a handful of a larger group who accompanied them on the trans-Atlantic journey, bought of land on October 28, 1831, from Mrs. Sarah Collins. After a few years, Roebling left farming to return to his career as an engineer. He developed a way to produce wire rope or cable, and used it in several of his projects, beginning with an aqueduct. He produced the wire rope at a workshop on his property in Saxonburg. He designed several suspension bridges, including two in Pittsburgh and one in Philadelphia. His most famous is his Brooklyn Bridge in New York. The Roebling Museum in the borough maintains several artifacts of his notable career. In November 1920, KDKA radio, regarded as the world's first commercial radio station, began broadcasting from East Pittsburgh. Later it located its transmitter in neighboring Clinton Township of Butler County. While the transmitter facility is no longer in Butler County, artifacts of it remain on display at the Saxonburg Museum, co-located with Roebling Park. An internet- based radio station, saxonburgradio.com, serves the borough and surrounding southern Butler County with music and local news. The station also broadcasts over the air throughout Saxonburg on AM 1620 and FM 100.3 under FCC Part 15 rules. Nuclear lab In 1946, Fred Seitz, head of the physics department at Carnegie Tech, recruited Ed Creutz, Jack Fox, Roger Sutton and Bert Corben to the university to develop an important nuclear physics research program. By June 6, 1946, they had built a leading-edge, 450 MeV proton synchrocyclotron at the Nuclear Research Center near Saxonburg, just south of the city limits. The research program flourished up to the mid-1970s. By then the accelerator had become obsolete and was dismantled. The site was converted to industrial purposes, and is now occupied by II-VI Corporation. As of 1997, only one or two of the original Nuclear Research Center buildings remained intact, including the original laboratory building. South Butler Street, off Main Street, Saxonburg Murder of Police Chief Adams On the afternoon of December 4, 1980, career criminal Donald Eugene Webb was the chief suspect in the murder of the borough police chief Gregory Adams in Saxonburg. This was the second homicide in the borough's nearly 150-year history and received national attention, especially as Webb was never apprehended. Webb was put on the FBI Most Wanted List, but was never captured. After the FBI found new evidence in her house in 2016, in July 2017, his wife Lillian Webb confessed to hiding her husband for 17 years, and led the FBI and police to his remains buried in the yard of her Massachusetts house.

History Dettmar Basse (Anton Graff, c. 1792) Zelienople was named for the eldest daughter of Baron Dettmar Basse (1762‚Äì1836), whose chosen name was Zelie (her given name was Fredericka) which she named herself after her favorite doll. Baron Basse arrived in 1802 from Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and purchased a tract of of land in Butler and Beaver counties. He proceeded to lay out a village and build his own private residence, a three story castle, complete with towers, turrets and battlements, named \\"The Bassenheim\\", which was destroyed by fire on July 29, 1841. At the time, Zelie was betrothed to Philip Louis Passavant, and was still in Germany. Extensive preparations were made by Baron Basse to establish the new home and town in America and prepare it for his daughter's arrival in September 1807. Baron Basse sold of his land to George Rapp, a Bavarian pietist religious leader, who founded the village of Harmony. Baron Basse came to be known as \\"Dr. Muller\\". Whether the title of \\"Doctor\\" was given to him due to a knowledge of medicine, or conferred upon him as a degree, is unknown. He was regarded as an intelligent man, and during the Napoleonic era represented Frankfurt as an ambassador to Paris. Basse returned to Germany in 1818, leaving his business to his son-in-law, Philipp Passavant. Philip Passavant opened the first store in 1807, and managed it for 41 years, until he gave it to his son, C. S. Passavant. By 1826, there were fifty houses in Zelienople, and three churches. The population in 1870 was 387, and in 1890, it had grown to 639. In 1879, the first passenger train arrived to the town, substantially increasing the growth and commerce. In 1880, the American Union Telegraph Company established an office in Zelienople. The Federalists appointed Andrew McClure, a local tavern-keeper, as the first postmaster of Zelienople in the first decade of 1800. Christian Buhl was named the first justice of the peace in 1840. Early Zelienople commerce supported the local agriculture community, as there was no viable means of transportation. In 1840 Zelienople was incorporated as a borough. In 1878 a railroad was built through Zelienople. From this time there has been moderate expansion of industry, residences, and local government. There has been a volunteer fire department since about 1850. A full-time Borough Manager was hired in 1994. The growth of Pittsburgh to the south, along with the building of Interstate 79, provides a challenge to Zelienople in coping with these changes through the 21st century. Zelienople was linked to Ellwood City, Evans City and Pittsburgh in 1908 by the Pittsburgh, Harmony, Butler and New Castle Railway, an interurban trolley line. The line closed on 15 June 1931, and the trolleys were replaced by buses. Zelienople is also known for its historical Eichholtz Building. The Eichholtz family played a historical and transformational role in Zelienople.  Culture and events  150px Every year, Zelienople hosts a Fourth of July parade through downtown. The Strand Theater is a performing arts center on Main Street that has been restored, and hosts concerts and films for the borough and surrounding area. For the past 44 years, one of the major annual events is the town's summer Horse Trading Days Arts and Music Festival.

The population of Cresson at the 2010 census was 1,711. The location was named in 1854 as a memorial to philanthropist Elliott Cresson. Railroads, beginning with the Allegheny Portage Railroad, fueled the growth of the area. Many famous Pittsburgh businessmen, including Charles M. Schwab, Andrew Carnegie, and Henry Clay Frick, maintained summer residences in the area. The borough was incorporated in 1906, along with neighboring Sankertown. Geography Cresson is located in eastern Cambria County at (40.462631, -78.586319), atop the Eastern Continental Divide, the height of land between the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and the Ohio River valley.

The Queen Anne style structure was opened by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1881, sold to the Cresson Springs Co., and demolished in 1916. It was hoped to attract visitors from Pittsburgh and Johnstown looking for clean air and \\"therapeutic\\" mineral springs. Although itself unsuccessful, it led to the development of several other hotels, companies, and the town itself. The area is currently known as the \\"Mountainhouse Grounds\\" to local residents and is in the midst of development.

It is bordered by Gallitzin Township and Tunnelhill, all of which sit astride the Eastern continental divide. Tunnel Hill and Gallitzin both are pierced by railroad tunnels shortening the necessary ascent for rails crossing the Allegheny Front onto the Allegheny Plateau which encompasses the towns terrains. Topping the gaps of the Allegheny, the area is one of only five major breaks in the Appalachians allowing east-west transportation corridors before the advent of 20th century technologies. History Dutch traders and trappers friendly to the Susquehannock may have visited the region about 1620, as the town sits atop a mountain pass through which the ancient Amerindian trails later renamed the Kittanning Path transited. The plateau atop the escarpment was the domain of the Iroquoian confederations of the Erie people and the Susquehannock peoples, both sharing the byways and hunting lands of the Allegheny Mountains until about the mid-1650s.American Heritage's editors present the Erie, Neutrals, Tabacco, and Huron had all been overcome by the Iroquois by around 1649-1656, the Erie being the last to fall in that year. Note the conflict with data of 1662's alliance. The Susquehannock and Erie people are known to have traded through the area, one of the few avenues the Erie, who dominated the hunting lands west of the Alleghenies had to obtain fire arms, though by all accounts, all the tribes in contact with the numerous Erie were reluctant to trade them fire arms.ERIE HISTORY, http://www.dickshovel.com/erie.html, 2016-0612 Further, Susquehannocks are quoted to have expected 800 Erie warriors in 1662 to join in their war with the Iroquois.ERIE HISTORY, http://www.dickshovel.com/erie.html, 2016-0612, quote: \\"In 1662 the Susquehannock told the Dutch they expected 800 Honniasont warriors to join them in their war with the Iroquois. Honniasont is a Iroquian word meaning \\"wearing something around the neck\\" and refers to the Black Mingua habit of wearing a black badge on their chests. The Honniasont (Black Mingua) are believed to have been a division of the Erie that lived around the upper Ohio River in western Pennsylvania. 800 warriors would require a population in excess of 3,000 and may have been an exaggeration (Susquehannock or Dutch). It does, however, indicate that there was a large group still free in 1662, but they were gone by 1679.\\" Alternative nicknames of the later Mingo tribe who definitely lived west of the mountains & shared Iroquoian ancestry with and the commonalities with the Black Mingua name suggest the Erie remnants also became the seed tribe of the new Mingos. By 1675 both the Susquehannocks and Erie tribes would both fall to rampant multiple-years of epidemic diseases in combination with the vicious multi-decade internecine territorial bloodletting known as the Beaver Wars which left the Alleghenies a remote hunting ground of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederation. As British colonists began their multi-decade onslaught of deal breaking and genocide, by the early 1700s the Delaware people still living along the eastern seaboard were increasingly treated as bad or worse than slaves, and displaced clear across the breadth of Pennsylvania, to beyond the Allegheny Front, where they settled along the rivers of Western Pennsylvania. One of their larger settlements, and closest to the gaps of the Allegheny, was the Amerindian town of Kittanning along the middle reaches of the Allegheny River. These towns would generally ally themselves with the French during the French and Indian War, causing settlers in central Pennsylvania to mount a guard and patrol on the gaps. By the late 1700s, the remnant Seneca and Cayuga that became known as the Ohio Iroquois or Mingo would have ranged the area, especially because they were known to make their towns along defensible hill tops and kept to the uplands. With Iron and Coal discovered west of the gaps, white settlers began traveling west through the area around the time the American Revolution came to a close. By 1824, the visionary Main Line of Public Works legislation had been debated and signed and the construction of the Allegheny Portage Railroad soon began aiming to connect Pittsburgh and the Ohio Country to Philadelphia by canals. In 1838, this plan was altered to incorporate the rapidly developing and ever more capable railroad technology. In 1845, the Pennsylvania legislature required the new Pennsylvania Railroad to cross the mountains, and the surveyed route would create Gallitzin which began life as 'Summit Tunnel'. A Railroad town standing west of Altoona, it was first incorporated in 1872, and named for Prince Gallitzin, who founded the Catholic town of Loretto in Cambria County. Coal mining, the Pennsylvania Railroad yard in the town center and the production of coke were important industries. The town still sports an important rail yard with a turning wye for helper engine turn around and holds two rail tunnels leading east and downward from the yard trackage to the famous PRR Horseshoe Curve whose upper approaches are within the town. Gallitzin is listed by the US Census Bureau as part of the Johnstown Metropolitan Statistical Area, although local sources consider it part of the Altoona area, due to being located closer to Altoona than to Johnstown. In 1900, 2,759 people lived in Gallitzin, and by 1910, that number had risen to 3,504 people. As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough population was 1,668. Gallitzin is known for its historic railroad tunnels (Gallitzin Tunnels), which are a minor tourist draw. The scenic Horseshoe Curve and the Allegheny Portage Railroad historic site are also nearby situated in different gaps of the Allegheny. Geography Gallitzin is located in eastern Cambria County at (40.481816, -78.552336), along the eastern edge of the Allegheny Plateau, a highland area of hills and small streams formed differently from the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians to the east and south of the plateau's edge, the Allegheny Ridge in Pennsylvania. Sitting astride the eastern Continental divide along the edge of the Allegheny Front escarpment, the immediate area is lower than other portions of the Appalachian plateau, so contains several small streams and freshets forming the gaps of the Allegheny Escarpment to the east, where the ground fall away rapidly forming steep terrain landforms.

Notable people * John Brophy, labor leader * James Anthony \\"Ripper\\" Collins, major league baseball player * Charlie Metro, major league baseball player/manager * Boyd David \\"Buzz\\" Wagner, first flying ace of World War Two Historyhttp://www.nantyglo.com/frm7.htm What is now Nanty Glo borough originated in the 1890s and was called \\"Glenglade.\\" By 1896, the community was a lumber camp of 13 houses built on both sides of the southern branch of Blacklick Creek, which forms the border of Blacklick Township on the north side and Jackson Township on the south side. A post office opened for Glenglade on November 21, 1894, with Merton A. Davis as the first postmaster. Three Davis brothers took turns as postmaster: Merton A., from 1894 until 1900; Montell, 1900 until 1911, and Everett C., 1911‚Äì1916. According to oral history, the town name was changed to \\"Nant-y-glo\\" during the term of Montell Davis, through the intervention of his wife. Glenglade became Nant-y-glo on February 20, 1901. Whether the Davises had the small town of the same name in Wales in mind or just thought the melodic-sounding Welsh phrase fit the town is not known. The name of \\"Blacklick\\" for the creek that bisects the town and the adjacent township probably means much the same as \\"brook of coal\\", a lick being a common synonym for brook and the \\"black\\" referring to outcroppings of coal seams on the stream banks and bed. By 1899 the huge coal deposits in the settlement had attracted additional settlers, and the Pennsylvania Railroad installed a spur line through the community that year. Commercial mining was initiated in 1896 by Dr. James W. Dunwiddie of Pine Flats, Indiana County, who opened up what was then called Nanty Glo No. 1. Nanty Glo was described in the 1940 Pennsylvania guide as being \\"a valley coal town wrapped in a mist of sulphurous gas. Four large bituminous coal mines support the town, which was founded in 1888 as a lumber camp. Rows of yellow shacks extend back from the central mine. Some, flanked by mine heaps, cling to the mountain sides.\\" Heisley Mine (1915) was by far the largest, most profitable, and longest-lived Nanty Glo mine. It was originally owned and operated by Coleman-Weaver Company as Heisley Mine No. 3 until 1922, when Coleman-Weaver dissolved and partner John Heisley Weaver, a Philadelphia industrialist, acquired sole ownership. Colman-Weaver Company also originally owned the mines in Revloc and Colver and launched the Cambria and Indiana Railroad (C&I;), which served most Cambria County mines through most of the 20th century. Weaver also owned the mines in Heilwood, Indiana County, which was renamed from Possum Glory to Heilwood after Weaver's nickname, \\"Heil\\", from Heisley. Weaver died in 1934, and his company sold Heisley to Bethlehem Mines in 1948. Bethlehem renamed the mine Monroe Mine No. 131 and later renamed it Bethelehem Mine 31 and moved its main entrance from Nanty Glo to Jackson Township (Leidy Portal). The mine closed in the 1980s. Other mines in what is now Nanty Glo and their starting dates included Lincoln (1900); Springfield, owned by the Peale, Peacock and Kerr Company (1907); Emma Coal Company (1909); and Webster, later owned by the Pennsylvania Coal & Coke Company, Ivory Hill, and the Warren Colliery. \\"House coal\\" mines on a much smaller scale (selling coal by the truckload directly to homeowners for house heating) included Lorraine, Bech, Johnson, Cornely, Dorsch, Yobbagy, and Ebandjieff. Schools Formal education came to Nanty Glo about 1898 with a school opening on what was then the Jackson side of the settlement. Later, a school was opened on the Blacklick or northerly side of the creek. Over the years, there were numerous one-room school houses, and in 1918 a fourth-class school district was established. The first four-year high school class was graduated in 1925. In 1957 the school district merged with that of nearby Vintondale, and in 1967 Blacklick Township became part of a triple jointure to form the present Blacklick Valley School District. The Blacklick Valley Junior-Senior High School (grades seven through 12) is at 555 Birch Street, Nanty Glo. The Blacklick Valley Elementary Center (pre- kindergarten through grade six) is at 1000 W. Railroad, Nanty Glo. Nanty Glo's churches, hotels, theaters, industries, media, fire company, and public library The first house of worship in Nanty Glo was the Methodist Episcopal Church, now United Methodist, established in 1901. Other places of worship in the community, past and present, include St. Mary's Roman Catholic (1902), First Baptist (1913), St. Nicholas Byzantine Catholic (1919), Church of God (1920), Christian & Missionary Alliance and Holy Ascension Ukrainian Orthodox (1921), Church of the Brethren (1922) and Church of the Nazarene (1935). In the 1920s, a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses, a Finnish Lutheran Church, and a Jewish synagogue were started, all three of which no longer exist. Over the years, Nanty Glo had several hotels, including the Home, St. James, Commercial, and Jackson. At one time Nanty Glo had three movie houses, two of which have been destroyed by fires. The third, the Liberty, is now being remodeled as the Blacklick Valley's historical museum. In addition to coal mining, Nanty Glo had at various times a chemical works, soft drink bottling plant, plastic factory, and a dress manufacturing firm. All of these industries, along with all of the underground mines, have ceased operation. Nanty Glo was incorporated as a borough in 1918, taking in parts of Blacklick Township and Jackson Township. After the city of Johnstown, Nanty Glo was the largest municipality in Cambria County, with a population of over 5,000, for most of the 20th century. Nanty Glo Journal Two newspapers have served the borough during its history. In late 1920 or early 1921, a small publication called the Nanty Glo Bulletin was published. That paper was purchased by Herman Sedloff, a Russian emigre working as a typesetter in New York who moved to Nanty Glo specifically to establish a labor-oriented weekly newspaper. He published the first edition of the Nanty Glo Journal on May 5, 1921, and continued as its publisher until his retirement in the 1960s. The Journal continues to serve under new ownership. The Nanty Glo home page It was established as a not-for-profit and free-to-use community website in 1997 by Jon Kennedy, a local native who began writing for the Journal while in high school and was its editor from 1962 to 1964 while attending Johnstown College (now UPJ). The website continues to serve the community with thousands of discrete pages, one of the earliest blogs established on the World Wide Web, and several hundred film and video clips. In 2019, after having been unable to update the site for several years because of advancing age, Kennedy transferred the home page to Stephen Oravec, a native of Vintondale and former resident of Nanty Glo, currently residing in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Fire department In 1913, the Nanty Glo Volunteer Fire Company was chartered. That same year, a hand-drawn hose cart with of hose was purchased by the town's governing body, and the fire company remains strong to the present time, having an enrollment now of over 100 members. A ladies' auxiliary to the fire company was organized in 1927 by 44 women of the community. Nanty Glo Public Library It was launched in 1980. After outgrowing several earlier locations, it now occupies a spacious former store building at 942 Roberts Street. Historical society The Nant-Y-Glo Tri- Area Museum and Historical Society was established in May, 2000, to serve Nanty Glo Borough, Blacklick Township, Jackson Township, and Vintondale. The former Liberty Theater building has been acquired and is now being refurbished to display historical artifacts of the Blacklick Valley. In 2012 the Society acquired the former Nanty Glo News (previously, Hawksworth Hardware) Building and refurbished it as the Liberty Cafe, a nonprofit enterprise supporting the Historical Society. Jim Toth is the project manager and treasurer. Points of interest Just one mile north of U.S. Highway 22, Nanty Glo is the major entry point to the Ghost Town Trail, a biking and walking trail that traverses much of Cambria County and adjacent Indiana County along former railroad beds. Free parking is available next to the trail entrances on both sides of the Fire Hall in the town center. The Liberty Museum is nearing completion at the former Liberty Theater at the intersection of Shoemaker and Roberts streets. Cultural references Coal pickers like this one could make as much as a dollar a day salvaging usable coal from the mountains of refuse, coal that the mines rejected as second-rate. This photo was taken in 1937 at Nanty Glo's Springfield Mine, and is now in the Library of Congress collection. Both Time and Life magazines did stories on Nanty Glo as their prime exhibit for their coverage of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's taking control of the nation's coal mines after mine workers defied a congressional law by going on strike at the height of World War Two.

It was formed from the merger of two smaller municipalities, Barnesboro and Spangler. After the merger, the town was given the nickname ‚ÄúThe 2‚Äù, as 2 municipalities joined in the year 2000. The area was first settled by Europeans in the early-to-middle 19th century. The presence of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River allowed loggers to move their harvest downstream. Small farms developed, but the area changed in the 1890s when mining of the extensive bituminous coal fields in the area became the dominant industry. The mining companies required skilled workers, and many came from Great Britain and Eastern Europe. Railroads were built to transport the coal out, and the town flourished with the influx of money. In the 1980s, the coal industry began a decline, and there has been a subsequent decline in the population of the area. In November 1922, the Reilly Shaft No. 1 mine explosion occurred, killing 78 coal miners.Reilly Shaft Explosion, retrieved on December 11, 2008 A pumpkin weighing was grown by resident Larry Checkon in 2005 (a world record at that time).

Patton is perhaps best known for an important local manufacturer, the Patton Clay Works. The Clay Works were one of the largest clay and brick concerns in the world in the first half of the 1900s. The company manufactured terra cotta products (pipe and tiles), building bricks, and pavers (known as \\"Patton Pavers\\") from 1893 until it closed in 1968. Bricks made there were used in the construction of the Panama Canal, and the pavers were used around the Eiffel Tower in France. The products were made from clay excavated from the area. Due to the loss of the Clay Works, Patton‚Äôs population has had a major decline. In 1960 it had a population of 2,880, to an estimated 1,626 in 2018.

It is southeast of Ebensburg and southwest of Altoona. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,638 at the 2010 US census. History Portage's name comes from the practice of portage or portaging which is the process of carrying a water craft or cargo over land between two bodies of water. The \\"portaging\\" that occurred in this area was due to the Allegheny Portage Railroad which ran from Hollidaysburg westward to Johnstown over the Allegheny Front, the height of land separating the Eastern Seaboard of the United States from the Ohio River Valley. The line opened in 1834 and Portage was situated on the #2 plane of the Allegheny Portage Railroad system. Pennsylvania Route 53 follows the route of the railroad through Portage. The unloading spot for the railroad in Portage was the Washington House, which was located where Portage Auto Wreckers is currently. By 1854, the Allegheny Portage Railroad was considered obsolete due to the Pennsylvania Railroad which traveled over the Alleghenys considerably faster and safer. At the same time, another company, the New Portage Railroad, was attempting to do the same, but in 1857, the Pennsylvania Railroad bought the New Portage railroad and abandoned it. Within a few years after the opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad, a station was constructed for locomotives to stop to take on water and pick up wood to fire the boiler. This lasted until the wood was replaced by coal to fire the locomotives. All of the lumber and coal industries in Portage caused a population boom, and by the 1860s a passenger station was built by the railroad along the mainline, which at the time traveled through the center of town on what is now the Sonman Branch Line. Portage Township was cut from Washington and Summerhill Townships on March 4, 1874. On October 7, 1890, the borough of Portage was incorporated and cut from Portage Township. The Pennsylvania Railroad re-aligned the mainline from Lilly to Summerhill in the 1890s, and a new station was built on Washington Avenue. The station remained open until 1926 when a new station was built on Lee Street. The town continued to grow in size into the 1920s when it reached its peak population (4,804 at the 1920 United States Census). On July 15, 1940, at the Sonman Shaft Coal Co. near Portage, 63 miners died when a methane gas explosion occurred. In 1960, a memorial to the miners who died in the explosion which was originally located in Jamestown, but was relocated to Crichton-McCormick Park in Portage. The Portage Station Museum offers a documentary about the disaster titled \\"63 Men Down: The Story of the Sonman Mine Explosion\\", along with coal mine and railroad artifacts and exhibits. In November 1953, the Pennsylvania Railroad closed the passenger station. It was used a few months after that to just hold freight but was shut down altogether by mid-1954. The population in Portage stayed steady around 4,000 until the late 1970s. The steep drop in population since then was due to all the coal mines in the region closing and much of the steel industry slowing down in nearby Johnstown, due to the 1977 Johnstown Flood. To celebrate the town's centennial, Summerfest was organized. It has since been celebrated every year in mid-August. The festival has many traditions including many ethnic foods and a mass service in the morning of Sunday that weekend. Another event held every year in Portage is the annual community yard sale, organized by the Portage Area Historical Society and held in mid-June. The Portage Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Portage adopted a home rule charter on May 10, 1994, that took effect on January 1, 1996. Although the community kept \\"Borough of Portage\\" as its official name, it is no longer governed under the state's Borough Code. Fire company The Portage Volunteer Fire Company was chartered in 1906. At this time it was a one-bay-door barn with a horse-drawn engine. In 1936 the company updated their fleet with a new American LaFrance engine. They were one of the first companies to have purchased a fire engine, and they began to run mutual aid to other departments. Many years later, they got more apparatus, and realized the single garage building was too small, so in 1977, they constructed the municipal building/fire station that also houses the Portage Boro Police Department. In 2009, the Cassandra Volunteer Fire Company and Portage Volunteer Fire Company merged to better serve the community and eliminate duplication of services in the area. In 2015, members from the Wilmore Volunteer Fire Company and Portage Volunteer Fire Company accepted a merger to better serve their communities. Today, the Portage Volunteer Fire Company operates out of two stations and has a fleet of one Quint, one rescue engine, one engine, one tanker, one ATV/brush unit, and two support vehicles. In late 2015, PVFC will be receiving a new 3,000-gallon 4 Guys Tanker and in 2016 a new Sutphen Rescue-Engine to replace retired Rescue 83.

The population was 490 at the 2010 census. History Summerhill, a small borough in the Allegheny Mountains in southwestern Pennsylvania, was settled in the early 1800s and grew in large part from the Allegheny Portage Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Thomas and Barbara Croyle family was one of the earliest recorded families to settle in the town in 1794. Their family homestead, a two-story stone structure that still stands, served the family as a fortress against Indian attacks. According to some sources, Indians burned the Croyles' cabin and property, causing the family to seek refuge at Fort Bedford. By 1800, Barbara Croyle chose to rebuild their homestead with stone; she limited windows to two sides of the house to keep it stronger if attacked. The Croyle family built a grist mill, known locally as Croyle's Mill, and a dam on the Little Conemaugh River to operate it. The establishment of the mill was significant enough for the county to notice and fund its first public works project, a dirt road from Ebensburg to Croyle's Mill. The mill operated into the 1900s. In February 1810, Summerhill Township was devolved from larger Conemaugh Township, one of three original townships established in Cambria County. Originally spelled \\"Somerhill\\", the township was likely named for Joseph and David Somers, some of its early, chief landowners. In the 1820s, Summerhill Township covered a large swath of land in the north-central part of the current county, including present-day Jackson, Munster, Washington, Portage and Blacklick townships. The existing borough took its name from Summerhill Township and was then known as Summer Hill. Records from 1926 indicate the borough's current spelling, Summerhill. Geography Summerhill is located in south-central Cambria County at (40.375424, -78.760623) in the Laurel Highlands of the Allegheny Mountains. The north branch of the Little Conemaugh River and Laurel Run, tributaries of the Conemaugh River, run through the community. Summerhill is bordered on the west by the borough of Ehrenfeld. U.S. Route 219, a four-lane expressway, runs through the northwest part of the borough, with access from an interchange with Pennsylvania Route 53 southwest of the borough limits.

The population was 2,007 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Susquehanna Township was incorporated on January 6, 1825, being formed from Allegheny and Cambria Townships. In addition to agriculture, the ready local supply of lumber attracted people to the area in the early 19th century. Much of this was transported down the West Branch Susquehanna River to lumber towns such as Williamsport. In the late 19th century, the arrival of the railroad opened up the area to coal mining. The subsequent mining boom created many jobs, attracting a large number of people to settle in the area of Susquehanna Township, many of whom remained with their families after the boom had ended.

It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 5,181 at the 2010 census, down from 5,523 at the 2000 census. Geography Westmont is located in southwestern Cambria County and is bordered to the east by the city of Johnstown, to the north by the borough of Brownstown, and to the south by the borough of Southmont and the unincorporated community of Elim. Westmont sits on heights rising up to above the Stonycreek and Conemaugh River valleys in the center of Johnstown. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Westmont has a total area of , all of it land. History Before the Johnstown Flood of 1889, the Yoder Hill area consisted of nothing more than a few farms, accessible by only a few steep, muddy roads. However, since the flood was so devastating to the city and to its major employer, the Cambria Iron Company, the iron company decided to develop the top of the hill as a suburb for its top personnel to live in. The company commissioned the famous landscape architect, Charles Miller, to lay out the grid for the settlement of \\"Tiptop\\", later renamed Westmont. Westmont was located on a ridge high above the valley in which Johnstown is located, and thus in a place of safety. As such, it was also above the smoke, noise, and stench of the city, and attracted the well- to-do of the town, eager to escape what (in many cases) their own factories had wrought. An inclined railway, the Johnstown Inclined Plane, was built for easy travel to the city. With the problem of transportation solved, the new settlement began to grow, and it was incorporated as the Borough of Westmont on June 13, 1892. In 1935, the borough bought the inclined railway from Bethlehem Steel. In 1938 the Johnstown Traction Company began to operate bus service to Westmont via buses that rode up and down the Inclined Plane. At one time there were plans to extend the Southmont streetcar line from its terminus at Diamond Boulevard and Menoher Boulevard along Diamond Boulevard to Luzerne Street, and then along Luzerne Street in the center median to Colgate Avenue. This rail service extension was never constructed, and streetcar service on the Southmont line was discontinued in 1954 when a rock slide along Southmont Boulevard damaged the track and overhead. Following completion of the \\"Easy Grade\\" highway of Menoher Boulevard (PA Route 271) from downtown Johnstown through to Westmont, bus service was transferred to this route and service via the Inclined Plane was discontinued. Because of its upland location, Westmont escaped destruction in the subsequent floods that damaged flood-prone Johnstown. A Westmont native was the first American soldier to die in the Vietnam War. Captain Harry Griffith Cramer Jr. grew up at 321 Luzerne Street, a house which still stands today. He graduated from West Point in 1946, earned a Silver Star for valor in Korea, and commanded the first team of US Special Forces advisers to deploy to Vietnam. He was killed near Nha Trang on October 21, 1957. The Westmont Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Westmont today Luzerne Street in the Westmont Historic District, November 2014 Westmont continues to be a town of significant attractive, large, old houses. The present population of Westmont is approximately 5,000 residents. Westmont is currently governed by the \\"Weak Mayor-Council\\" form of government. There are seven council members and a mayor who are elected by the voters for four-year staggered terms. The mayor votes only in case of a tie. The borough council determines municipal policy, enacts laws, approves borough officials, etc. Daily operations are supervised by the borough secretary and the public works director. Westmont has a volunteer fire company and an ambulance service. Police protection is provided by the West Hills Regional Police Department. Today Westmont, even though considerably larger than that envisioned by the Cambria Iron Company officials, still retains many of the characteristics that attracted residents here in the first place. It is, for the most part, still a quiet, tree-lined community. One can see joggers, walkers and children throughout the community at all times of the day. Borough restrictions against commercial enterprise are still enforced. Perhaps the town's standout feature is the all√©e of American elm trees along Luzerne Street, the last cathedral-arched boulevard left in the United States. Today there are 195 elms, the longest continuous stand of American elms in the country, planted along Luzerne Street. Westmont's elm trees are intensively maintained to protect them from Dutch elm disease.

History In the book Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania, author William J. Switala makes reference to Wilmore being a part of the Johnstown-Wilmore-Ebensburg-Burnside route. \\"From Johnstown, the fugitive slaves moved northeasterly through the heavily wooded valleys and gullies of the Appalachian Mountains. The more well known of the two routes ‚Ä¶ proceeds from Johnstown all the way to Ebensburg, following the trace that eventually became US-219. Blockson mentions a stop along the route at the hamlet of Wilmore, a small black community located about eight miles south of Ebensburg and near Portage. Godfrey Wilmore, a former slave from Maryland, is reported to have founded the community.\\" Godfrey Wilmore was born 1751 in or near Cumberland, Allegheny County, Maryland [8] and died April 2, 1815 in Wilmore; he was buried at St. Michael's Cemetery, Loretto, Pennsylvania. Godfrey married Mary Higgins, who was born 1747 in Ireland and died Aug 28, 1822, in Wilmore; buried St. Michael's Cemetery, Loretto. Godfrey was a freed slave of African descent. Mary was either an indentured servant or a redemptioner and was of Irish descent. Both his and Mary Higgins' servitude were documented within Harford County, Maryland. Godfrey is said to have been a man of above average intellect, who could read and write. This is referenced numerous times within Cambria County documents by the notation that Godfrey Wilmore wrote the document and witnessed it by his signature, whereas the other parties sign by their mark \\"X\\". In that he was a slave, the fact that he could read and write is remarkable and suggests that he may have been a \\"house slave\\" or a supervisory slave laborer. Even more remarkable is that it is further said that he was an energetic man who worked enough extra, outside of his servitude, that he was able to buy his freedom. Documents go on to say that he then bought the remaining time of indentured servitude of his white wife Mary Higgins. It is also noted that due to his education, Godfrey becomes the first teacher in the area that surrounds Wilmore. According to the \\"Souvenir of St. Michael's Parish, Loretto, Pa.\\" - On or about 1800 (?), this family traveled from Harford Co., Maryland, along the Conococheague Valley (pronounced by the early settlers \\"Con-eck e-jig\\"), westward through Cumberland, Maryland, and eventually coming to settle in a place then known as \\"Jimmy Rhey Place\\" (1909- John Mangus resides). This family was a charter pioneer in the formation of Summerhill Township (1810) and very likely a charter pioneer in the formation of Cambria County (1804). The family moved but once more, to a farm approx. 1 mile south of the town of Wilmore (1909- James H. White Farm). Godfrey built the first sawmill in this section of the county on the Little Conemaugh River, below the town of Wilmore, Pennsylvania. This water-driven sawmill was subsequently washed away and rebuilt about 800 yards east of the present (1910) Pennsylvania Railroad depot. Mary (Higgins) Wilmore was a Catholic. Godfrey Wilmore, on the other hand, was a Baptist and well acquainted with the Sacred Scriptures. Father Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, a Catholic priest, who was a former Russian prince, visited the Wilmore household with a view to reconciling the differences of religion within the family, and it was said that they had many earnest, controversial conversations, which eventually resulted in Godfrey's conversion to Catholicism. In 1829, Sylvester Welch's Corps of Engineers was running the lines of the Allegheny Portage Railroad through Summerhill Township, and they came across \\"‚Ä¶ a little village which they marked on their map 'Guinea', an appellation which the Irish laborers who built the road adopted until the matter was made a subject of complaint to Fr. Gallitzin, who from the altar denounced this insult to a family for whom he had the greatest respect. It was said that Father Gallitzin would chastise any person who would call the town by that opprobrious name and he declared that it should be known as Jefferson...\\" in honor of our third President. This is further referenced within the will of Bernard Wilmore, the oldest son of Godfrey and Mary Wilmore, that he lists the town of Jefferson as his home. It was Bernard, with the help of his nephew Martin Wilmore (son of James and Catharine Wilmore) who laid out the town-site of then Guinea, changing the name, because of the promptings of Father Gallitzin, to Jefferson (June 4, 1831). On June 10, 1831, the contract was let for Section 15 of the Old Portage Railroad, which ran through Jefferson by the time of its completion in 1834. Jefferson, as the name of the town, never caught on. The 6th post office in the county, established in Aug. 1832 along with the train depot, were forever referred to by the residents as \\"Wilmore's Post Office\\" and \\"Wilmore's Station\\" respectively. In 1859 the town was formally incorporated into a borough under the name of Wilmore and there were 20 homes. Mary Wilmore, who was a daughter of Godfrey and Mary Wilmore, married James Young. He was educated, could read and write and was a contractor and the person who built St. Bartholomew's Church- the present-day Gothic structure in Wilmore which replaced the small stone church. St. Bartholomew's Church was built in 1854. Even though Bernard Wilmore at the time of his death (1844) had left a small parcel of land in the center of town to Father Gallitzin to be used as a church, Father Gallitzin's executors sold the property and it is currently where the Evangelical Lutheran Church now stands.

The population was 869 at the 2010 United States Census. Geography Beaver Meadows is located in northwestern Carbon County at (40.928438, -75.912787) along Beaver Creek, amidst a historic transportation corridor dating back to Amerindian Trails through the wilderness area known to the Amerindians as \\"The Great Swamp\\". The Great Swamp was part of a vastly greater wilderness once known as ‚ÄúSt. Anthony‚Äôs Wilderness‚Äù and by the Amerindians, the ‚ÄúTowamensing‚Äù being an Indian word for ‚Äúwilderness‚Äù-- a vast pinewood forest and boggy swamp-plagued valleys watered by springs and mountain creeks such as Quakake Creek, Beaver Creek, Hazel Creek and others from the surrounding mountains. The Amerindians applied the term, ‚ÄúTowamensing‚Äù to the entire frontier area above the Blue Mountain Ridge, which while a valued hunting territory was considered less favorable to Indian settlements. Beaver Meadow is at an elevation of above sea level in the valley of Beaver Creek, north of Spring Mountain, part of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. In 1752, the lands of Carbon County and Beaver Meadows area were part of Northampton County, one of the three original counties of Pennsylvania, a county as big as New Jersey.Hazleton, PA Plain Speaker, 3 September 3, 1937 \\"History of Beaver Meadow, Carbon Co., Pa\\"Speaker Timeline the 1790s Warrior's Path was widened into a cart road some called the Lausanne-Nescopeck Road as Moravians increased their connections with the St. John's settlement in the Nescopeck Creek valley. In 1804 business interests desiring to ship timber to energy-hungry settlements raised money for a wagon road that could support timber sledges in winter snows, and the Lehigh and Susquehanna Turnpike was chartered, which is now closely followed by Pennsylvania Route 93 through the borough from over Broad Mountain at Nesquehoning, leading northwest to Hazleton and southeast to U.S. Route 209 in Nesquehoning. Weatherly is to the east via Spring Mountain Road, where Beaver Creek ends in confluence with Hazel Creek begating Black Creek. In 1800, Lausanne was created to provide local government for what is essentially all of Carbon County today: the eventual townships of East Penn, Lausanne, Mahoning, Banks, Towamensing, Lower Towamensing and Penn Forest; Pennsylvania townships being the most rural of organized municipal governments under the commonwealth constitution. In 1826 Mauch Chunk and other townships were split out of Lausanne and the center of that township was moved northwards. In 1843 Banks Township was organized, and incorporated the small settlement of Beaver Meadows within its larger girth. History The town of Beaver Meadows began as a recognizable and describable 'landmark' -- a meadow where beaver dams dotted the landscape -- along a well- known Amerindian Trail, known as the \\"Warriors' Path\\", and later as well-known as the trail used by Moravian Missionaries traveling between Berwick and Bethlehem, then became known as a toll gate/rest stop along the Lehigh and Susquehanna Turnpike, a bridle trail and wagon road chartered in 1804 from Jean's Run near the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek on the Lehigh River in the hamlet and township of Lausanne about nine miles south on the other side of Broad Mountain. In the 1790s a large tract of land was registered in the name of tbdl and a few farm houses dotted the valley until in 1812, anthracite coal was discovered in the vicinity of Junedale, a bedroom suburb neighborhood a Ruler tool measurement, GoogleMaps west of Beaver Meadows proper. In 1812, the secrets of burning anthracite were mostly yet to be discovered, revealed, and promoted (widely publicized) by Josiah White and Erskine Hazard but blacksmiths were several decades into knowing how to use it as an auxiliary fuel to complement bituminous or charcoal in forge fires, so by 1813 a modest pit mine was opened to provide coal for Berwick and Bloomington. The settlement's first dwelling was built in 1804 of logs. The first houses were built along the main thoroughfare, today's Broad Street east of the junction between Berwick St. (the continuation of the turnpike and Rt-93 to Hazelton) and Main St. westwards to Junedale, Tresckow, and Tamaqua. Nathan Beach discovered coal in 1812, and opened a 'quarry' (pit mine) in 1813, shipping his coal initially west by wagon to Berwick and Bloomsburg over the Berwick- Nescopeck Toll Bridge. With road improvements, he was able to ship his coal to Lausanne Landing where arks were being built by the Lehigh Coal Mine Company and coal could be transported to Philadelphia. In 1817, stymied by the slow movements of the Schuylkill Canal board of directors, White and Hazard began the improvements making the one-way Lehigh Navigations in 1818, and travel Lehigh River downstream grew steadily safer. By the end of 1820 the new Lehigh Canal, as yet rough and unfinished, nonetheless enabled a record 365 long-tons to be shipped to Philadelphia. By 1823 steady shipments allowed self-funding and the canal was being re-engineered and a gradual conversion begun into a system with two-way locks; its success in providing the affordable fuel to meet the young nation's energy demands, the Erie Canal opening, followed by the news of railroad events in Britain in 1825 began whole chains of events spurring industrial production and railroads.See for example, the Main Line of Public Works with ambitions to link Philadelphia by canal to Pittsburgh and Lake Erie. In 1826 Colonel William H. Wilson moved to the town and built a tavern. In 1831 James Lamison became citizen No. 3 and also opened a tavern. By that time the Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company had been formed and was subscribing stock. It was chartered on April 13, 1830, and the industrial revolution was about to begin using Beaver Meadows as a center. The company laid tracks down the valleys from Beaver and Black Creeks, the tributaries dumped into the Lehigh below and near Penn Haven Junction where the railroad expected to ship to the Lehigh Canal. At the time, the Room Run Railroad was occupying space assumed free by the Beaver Meadows planners assumptions, for in 1830 operating managers Josiah White & Erskine Hazard of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N; Co.) were opening new mines (freed now of immediate or further improvement needs of the Lehigh Canal or the Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad) in the area of what is now Nesquehoning and building a two- mile funicular railway called the Room Run or Rhume Run Railroad to increase volume shipped by the company. Hence the two railroads were to contend for the same space. At one point both companies put armed men into the field, but an amicable settlement was reached but for a rate dispute to break out. This resulted in a resolve to build the railroad all the way to Easton, but a deal was reached after the railroad reached past Mauch Chunk to Parryville, Pennsylvania, where auxiliary barge loading facilities were built. The Beaver Meadow Railroad & Coal Company bought and subcontracted coal operations to A.H. VanCleve and Co. opening their own mines. By 1833 they began local operations and construction of the railway along the surveyed right of way. Getting strong-armed by LC&N; Co., the company got a change in charter and continued downstream along the Lehigh until LC&N; Co. blinked and granted acceptable shipping rate terms. In 1835 they contracted for the first wood- burning steam locomotives to operate in Northampton and Carbon counties, which began operations in 1836. They also demonstrated that a railroad could be built over 30 miles through mountainous country. The Beaver Meadow Railroad became an operational success, and an inspiration. In 1846 investors began the ‚ÄúDelaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad Company‚Äù to link New York Harbor at Jersey City via New Jersey to the Susquehanna and then the great lakes via a line across the Delaware and up the Lehigh. They were successful; this was the start of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, whose oldest parts were the Beaver Meadows Railroad, it absorbed in 1866.

It is located on the southern coast of Scotland, south of Dumfries, on the edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve. Caerlaverock was a stronghold of the Maxwell family from the 13th century until the 17th century, when the castle was abandoned. It was besieged by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and underwent several partial demolitions and reconstructions over the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 17th century, the Maxwells were created Earls of Nithsdale, and built a new lodging within the walls, described as among \\"the most ambitious early classical domestic architecture in Scotland\\". In 1640 the castle was besieged for the last time and was subsequently abandoned. Although demolished and rebuilt several times, the castle retains the distinctive triangular plan first laid out in the 13th century. Caerlaverock Castle was built to control trade in early times. Today, the castle is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland and is a popular tourist attraction. It is protected as a scheduled monument. Ownership The history of the castle's builders can be traced to Undwin and his son Maccus in the 11th century; Maccus gave his name to the barony of Maccuswell or Maxwell. His grandson, John de Maccuswell (d. 1241), was first Lord Maxwell of Caerlaverock. The Baronies of Maxwell and Caerlaverock then passed down through the male line, sometimes collaterally. Robert de Maxwell of Maxwell, Caerlaverock and Mearns (d. 1409) rebuilt Caerlaverock castle and was succeeded by Herbert Maxwell of Caerlaverock (d. 1420). Etymology The name Caerlaverock is of Brittonic origin. The first part of the name is the element meaning \\"an enclosed, defensible site\\", (Welsh caer, \\"fort, city\\"). The second part of the name may be the personal name L√ØŒºarch (Welsh Llywarch), or a lost stream-name formed from the adjective laŒ≤ar, \\"talkative\\" (Welsh llafar, see Afon Llafar), suffixed with ‚Äì«≠g, \\"having the quality of\\", or the adjectival suffix -ƒ´g. The present form has been influenced by the Scots word laverock, \\"skylark\\". History View of one of the northern towers of the old, early 13th-century castle The present castle was preceded by several fortifications in the area: a Roman fort on Ward Law Hill and a British hill fort that was in use around 950. The earliest mention of the lands of Caerlaverock is around 1160, when they were granted to the monks of Holm Cultram Abbey.Gifford 1996, p.140 Around 1220 Alexander II of Scotland granted the lands to Sir John Maxwell, making him Warden of the West March. Sir John Maxwell also served as Chamberlain of Scotland from 1231‚Äì1233, and began work on the first castle at Caerlaverock. This castle was square in shape and was one of the earliest stone castles to be built in Scotland. It had a moat with a bridge facing north. Only the foundations and remains of a wooden enclosure around it remain. This early castle may have been incomplete when it was abandoned in favour of a rock outcrop some to the north. It was here that Sir John's brother Sir Aymer Maxwell began construction of the present castle. Sir Aymer also served as Chamberlain in 1258‚Äì1260, and was Justiciar of Galloway in 1264. In the 1270s the \\"new\\" castle was completed, and Herbert Maxwell, nephew of John Maxwell, occupied it. Historic view of Caerlaverock Castle When the moat around the second castle was dug, the quarrying was probably a source of building stone for the castle.Wilson & Hurst 1957, p. 158 While the gatehouse stands on natural rock, the rest of the castle was built on a clay platform created especially for the castle.Wilson & Hurst 1959, p. 308 Wars of independence In 1299, the garrison of Caerlaverock attacked Lochmaben Castle which was held by English forces. =Siege of Caerlaverock= The castle from the south-west in 2016 In July 1300 King Edward I of England marched north with an army including eighty-seven of the Barons of England and several knights of Brittany and Lorraine, and besieged Caerlaverock. Those present on the English side included Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Robert FitzWalter; Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford; John, Baron Segrave; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond; Patrick, Earl of March and his son; Prince Edward (the future Edward II); Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and his brother Henry; Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; and Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. The Maxwells, under their chief Sir Eustace Maxwell, mounted a vigorous defence of the castle which repelled the English several times. In the end, the garrison was compelled to surrender, after which it was found that only sixty men had withstood the whole English army for a considerable period. During the siege the English heralds composed a roll of arms in Old French verse, known as the Siege of Caerlaverock, in which each noble or knight present was named, his feats of valour described, and a poetic blazon of his armorial bearings given.Nicholas 1828.Wright 1864.Brault 1973.Wikisource: The Roll of Caerlaverock In recent years, Historic Scotland has organised re-enactments of the siege. Recovery Possession of the castle was subsequently restored to Sir Eustace Maxwell, Sir Herbert's son, who at first embraced the cause of John Balliol, and in 1312 received from Edward II an allowance of ¬£20 for the more secure keeping of the castle. He afterwards gave in his adherence to Robert Bruce, and his castle, in consequence, underwent a second siege by the English, in which they were unsuccessful. Fearing that this important stronghold might ultimately fall into the hands of the enemy, and enable them to make good their hold on the district, Sir Eustace dismantled the fortress, service and sacrifice for which he was liberally rewarded by Robert Bruce. By 1337 the castle was once again inhabited, and Sir Eustace now changed sides again, giving his support to Edward Balliol. Around 1355 Sir Roger Kirkpatrick of Closeburn captured Caerlaverock for David II of Scotland, and partly dismantled the castle.Gifford 1996, p.141 Repair and rebuilding View showing the latter addition to the castle at the north end of the Inner Court By the end of the Wars of Independence in the mid-14th century, Caerlaverock had been regained by the Maxwells, with Sir Robert Maxwell rebuilding much of the castle between 1373 and 1410. Further work was undertaken by Robert, 2nd Lord Maxwell, in the mid-15th century, probably involving reconstruction of the gatehouse. A new west range was added within the walls around 1500. The Catholic Maxwells took up the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, after her forced abdication in 1567. Caerlaverock was besieged in 1570 by an English Protestant force led by the Earl of Sussex, and was again partly demolished, including the destruction of the gatehouse with gunpowder. By 1593, John, 8th Lord Maxwell was repairing the castle again, building up the gatehouse for defence against the Johnstones of Annandale, with whom the Maxwells were feuding. The 8th Lord was killed by the Johnstones during a fight at Dryfe Sands, and in 1613 the 9th Lord Maxwell was executed for the revenge murder of Sir James Johnstone. Earls of Nithsdale In 1619 Robert, 10th Lord Maxwell, married Elizabeth Beaumont, cousin of the Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of James VI of Scotland. He was subsequently made Earl of Nithsdale and appointed to the Privy Council of Scotland. To reflect his new status he built the elaborate south and east ranges within the castle, known as the Nithsdale Lodging. Caerlaverock Castle in 1900 The new ranges were completed around 1634. Nithsdale was at Caerlaverock in August 1637, and wrote to Sir Richard Graham asking for dogs for hunting and breeding.HMC 6th Report: Graham (London, 1877), p. 335. Religious turmoil soon turned against the Catholic Maxwells. In 1640 the Protestant Covenanter army besieged Caerlaverock for 13 weeks, eventually forcing its surrender. According to Sir Henry Vane, the Earl and Countess of Nithsdale and their page were allowed to leave, but 40 defenders called Maxwell were put to the sword.Calendar State Papers Domestic: 1640-1641, vol. 17 (London, 1882), p. 84: TNA SP16/467/26. The south wall and tower were demolished, and the castle was never repaired or reoccupied. Protected areas Caerlaverock Castle is within the Nith Estuary National Scenic Area, protected for its scenic qualities, with the castle recognised as a landmark of the area. The castle is at the northern edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve, which extends to and consists of saltmarsh, mudflats and grazing land. It is an internationally important wintering site for waterfowl and wading birds, including the barnacle goose. Cultural references The castle was a filming location for the 2011 romantic comedy movie The Decoy Bride.

The population was 4,781 at the 2010 census. The town has been called the \\"Switzerland of America\\" due to the picturesque scenery, mountainous location, and architecture ; as well as the \\"Gateway to the Poconos\\". It is in eastern Pennsylvania about north of Philadelphia and west of New York City. This town is also historically known as the burial site for the body of Native American sports legend Jim Thorpe. History=Founding Central Railroad of New Jersey Station, now a visitors center Jim Thorpe was founded in 1818 as Mauch Chunk , a name derived from the term Mawsch Unk (Bear Place) in the language of the native Munsee-Lenape Delaware peoples: possibly a reference to Bear Mountain, an extension of Mauch Chunk Ridge that resembled a sleeping bear, or perhaps the original profile of the ridge, which has since been changed heavily by 220 years of mining. The company town was founded by Josiah White and his two partners, founders of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (LC&N;). The town would be the lower terminus of a gravity railroad, the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad, which would bring coal to the head of the LC&N; Lehigh Canal for transshipment to the confluence of the Delaware River, downstream at Easton. It would thereby ship LC&N;'s coal to Philadelphia, Trenton, New York City, and other large cities in New Jersey and Delaware, and by ocean to the whole East Coast. Canal shipping was eventually replaced by railroad shipping. Coal mining and the LC&N; canal The town grew slowly in its first decade, then rapidly around 1818 grew larger as it became an anthracite coal-shipping center. (The other large city with growing coal mining in the region was Scranton, with a population of over 140,000.) Mauch Chunk is on a Lehigh River west side (right bank) flat where Mahoning Creek enters and is a tributary of the Lehigh River. The river's left bank community of East Mauch Chunk, which has more of the houses of modern Jim Thorpe, was settled later to support the short-lived Beaver Creek Railroad, the mines which spawned it, and the logging industry. It came into greater growth when the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1885 pushed up the valley on the river's east bank to oppose LC&N;'s effective transportation monopoly over the region, which extended across to northwest Wilkes-Barre at Pittston on the Susquehanna River/Pennsylvania Canal. (See Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, a subsidiary of LC&N.;) Railroad growth and coal shipping After the Pennsylvania Canal Commission smoothed the way, Lehigh Coal & Navigation built the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&S;) from Pittston to Ashley, building the Ashley Planes inclined railway and linked that by rail from Mountain Top to White Haven at the head of the canal's upper works--referred to as the \\"Grand Lehigh Canal\\"--which navigations shortened the Lehigh Gorge (now located in the Lehigh Gorge State Park) route, cutting the distance from Philadelphia to Wilkes-Barre and the Wyoming Valley coal deposits by over . This placed Mauch Chunk in the center of a nexus of transportation in country tough to travel through. When floods wiped out many of the upper Lehigh Canal works in 1861, the L&S; Railroad was extended through the gap to supplant the canal, and the so-called switchback-twisted backtrack through Avoca, with the improved engines of the day, enabled two-way steam locomotive traction and traffic despite the steep grades. Owner LC&N; Company's headquarters was built across the street in Mauch Chunk from the L&S; Railroad's stylish brick passenger station that was soon boarding passengers onto trains from New York and Philadelphia to Buffalo. The Central Railroad of New Jersey eventually took over the L&S; and the station. The Lehigh Valley Railroad arrived on the river's east bank at East Mauch Chunk in 1855.,Jom Thorpe/Lehigh Valley Station wikipedia Major historical events Mauch Chunk was the location of one of the trials of the Molly Maguires in 1876, which resulted in the hanging of four men found guilty of murder.The Molly Maguires; Approaching Trial of the Murderers of John P.

The town's citizens had paid for her, a Thorpe son and Jim's body to be shipped from California, paid and arranged for the funeral service at St. Benedict's Catholic church, and paid for the mausoleum costs at Fairview Cemetery. Then Gov. Johnston Murray vetoed a bill which would contribute funds to the erection of the memorial at Athletic Park. On Sept. 1st Mrs. Thorpe, saying she feared Jim would be buried in a potter's field, shipped the body to Tulsa where she said the Chamber of Commerce was going to build a proper memorial, which was not true. When she heard that the boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were desperately seeking to attract business, she made a deal with civic officials. According to Jim Thorpe's son, Jack, Patricia was motivated by money in seeking the deal. Renaming to Jim Thorpe The two cross-river boroughs merged in 1954 and renamed the new municipality Jim Thorpe in his honor then obtained the athlete's remains from his wife and erected a monument to the Oklahoma native, who began his sports career southwest, as a student at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The monument site contains his tomb, two statues of him in athletic poses, and historical markers describing his life story.

Thorpe's son seeks return of remains, Associated Press, June 24, 2010 On February 11, 2011, Judge Richard Caputo ruled that Jack Thorpe could not gain any monetary award, nor any amount for attorney's fees in the lawsuit and that for the lawsuit to continue other members of the Thorpe family and the Sac and Fox Nation would have to join him as plaintiffs. Before Jack Thorpe could respond to the ruling he died at the age of 73 on February 22, 2011. Because of his death his representatives were given more time to respond to the ruling. On May 2, 2011, William and Richard Thorpe, Jim Thorpe's remaining sons and the Sac & Fox Nation of Oklahoma joined the lawsuit, allowing it to continue. On April 19, 2013, Federal Judge Richard Caputo ruled in favor of William and Richard Thorpe, ruling that the borough amounts to a museum under the law.

A former resident and architectural historian, Hans Egli, noted the vast range of styles: Federalist, Greek Revival, Second Empire, Romanesque Revival, Queen Anne, and Richardsonian Romanesque. Most of these architectural examples remained protected and intact beneath aluminum or vinyl siding that has since been removed. Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi, renowned Philadelphia architects, conducted a little-known planning study in the 1970s that attempted to understand the dynamics of historicism and tourism, notions that have come into their own in contemporary times. While Venturi's planning study was unique at the time, it has since become a critical factor in Jim Thorpe's rebound as a functioning and economically stable community.Out of the Ordinary: Robert Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Associates, Brownlee, David B. and Kathryn B.

The former New York City to Buffalo Lehigh Valley Railroad across the river is a present-day very active freight hauling railroad operated by Norfolk Southern. Mauch Chunk Switchback Gravity Railroad In 1827, the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, a coal mining and shipping company with operations in Summit Hill, Pennsylvania, constructed an downhill track, known as a gravity railroad, to deliver coal (and a miner to operate the mine train's brake) to the Lehigh Canal in Mauch Chunk. This helped open up the area to commerce, and helped to fuel the Industrial Revolution in the United States. By the 1850s, the \\"Gravity Road\\" (as it became known) was providing rides to thrill seekers for 50 cents a ride (equal to $ today). It is often cited as the first roller coaster in the United States. The Switchback Gravity Railroad Foundation was formed to study the feasibility of preserving and interpreting the remains of the Switchback Gravity Railroad on top of Mount Pisgah. Geography Jim Thorpe lies in the shadow of Mount Pisgah at the end of Pisgah Mountain (Pisgah Ridge), upriver of the Lehigh Water Gap between Bear Mountain on the east/left bank and the valley of Mauch Chunk Creek on the right bank. Jim Thorpe is located near the center of Carbon County at . In the deeps of the geologic timescale the two shorelines of the Lehigh River occupied by the 19th-century towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were situated on the bottom of an ancient river-fed tarn, a mountain lake which filled the valley on the west bank and covered the relative flatlands on the east bank. The muddy bottom of that high tarn (the range then rivaling the Himalayas in size), where the waters pooled at a lower elevation amongst the twisted folds of four near-parallel ridgelines, created a level region whose settlements became the relatively flat lands on either bank of the Lehigh. The ridgelines, which run east-northeast to west- southwest, are (from north to south) Broad, Nesquehoning, Pisgah, and Mauch Chunk ridges (or Mountains)--each of which runs over west to the gaps cut by the Schuylkill River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough of Jim Thorpe has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.15%, is water. Jim Thorpe is north and upstream of Lehighton, below the Lehigh Gap which sunders Bear Mountain on the east bank from the extended ridge of Mauch Chunk Mountain. The town is east of Nesquehoning, which is up a steep grade and around the bend along U.S. 209 South, and also butting up against the slopes of Mount Pisgah. This was a key element in the LC&N;'s planning, for the grade from the mountain ridge down to the river enabled them to fill barges quickly, using chutes and an elevated entry from a road down the ridge face. Jim Thorpe's developed elevations range between the river slack water at above sea level-- to the town's upper streets, all below the western peak of Mount Pisgah, which tops out at above sea level. The elevation of the Borough of Jim Thorpe ranges from at Broadway and Hazard Square downtown to above sea level northeast of the borough center near the Penn Forest Township line. It has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) and average downtown monthly temperatures range from 26.5 ¬∞F in January to 71.2 ¬∞F in July. The local hardiness zone is 6a. Transportation U.S. Route 209, although signed as a north‚Äìsouth route, tends to follow an east‚Äìwest route in Pennsylvania. In Jim Thorpe and Lehighton, U.S. 209 runs in directions opposite its signage‚Äîi.e., northbound U.S. 209 runs southwards and vice versa. It intersects the Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension (Interstate 476) east of Lehighton, about southeast of Jim Thorpe. Pennsylvania Route 903 has its southern terminus at U.S. 209 in Jim Thorpe. It is a north‚Äìsouth route that runs northeast of town, connecting to PA 115 near the Pocono Raceway, Interstate 476, and PA 534 in Penn Forest Township. Carbon County Community Transit provides bus service to Jim Thorpe along Lynx 1, which runs between Nesquehoning and the Lehigh Valley Mall on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Lynx 2, which runs between Nesquehoning and Walnutport on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The town is served by the Reading, Blue Mountain, and Northern Railroad with year-round freight service. Seasonal passenger excursions to and from the town were provided by its subsidiary, the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway, until November 25, 2019, due to a dispute over an amusement tax.https://www.rbmnrr.com/happenings Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 4,781 people, 2,290 households, and 1,468 families residing in the borough.

Recreation St. Mark's Episcopal Church In a poll conducted in 2009 by Budget Travel magazine, Jim Thorpe was awarded a top 10 spot on America's Coolest Small Towns. The town registered 3,920 votes to land the #7 spot on the list. In 2012, Jim Thorpe was voted the fourth most beautiful small town in America in the Rand McNally/USA Today Road Rally series. Jim Thorpe is becoming a tourist destination, with many businesses catering to white water rafting, mountain biking, paintball and hiking. Trails in Lehigh Gorge State Park attract hikers from all over, with Glen Onoko Falls a top trail destination just north of downtown. Along with these sports, Jim Thorpe was popular among railroading fans before passenger rail service was discontinued, and is known for its extraordinary architecture. The town is home to the Asa Packer and Harry Packer mansions. Asa Packer founded Lehigh Valley Railroad and Lehigh University; Harry was his son. The mansions sit side by side on a hill overlooking downtown. The Asa Packer Mansion is a museum and has been conducting tours since Memorial Day of 1956. The Harry Packer Mansion is a bed and breakfast; it served as the model for the Haunted Mansion ride at Walt Disney World in Florida. Jim Thorpe is home to the Anthracite Triathlon, an Olympic-distance triathlon open to amateur and professional triathletes. The swimming portion occurs in Mauch Chunk Lake. The bike course takes riders through the mining towns of Summit Hill, Nesquehoning, Lansford and Jim Thorpe. The running portion of the course is generally along the former alignment of a historic switchback railroad. The Anita Shapolsky Art Foundation was established at 20 West Broadway, in a 1859 former Presbyterian church, in Jim Thorpe in 1998. There, through the non- profit 501(c)3 organization, Anita Shapolsky exhibits abstract artists and contemporary artworks during the summer, and provides educational programs for children.

Hickory Run State Park occupies nearly in the southern half of the township. Kidder's numbered roads include Interstate 80 and the parallel Pennsylvania Route 940 east-to-west and Interstate 476, which is north-to-south and has the Pocono Interchange in the township with the former two. Route 903 crosses the southeast portion of Kidder on its way between Jim Thorpe and Route 115 just beyond the Monroe County line. Route 534 intersects 903 in Albrightsville and proceeds northwest to meet 80 and 940. Kidder has one more important road, which connects 903 and 940 via Lake Harmony and Split Rock. The portion between Split Rock and 940, Mosey Wood Road, is a private toll road operated by Vacation Charters Limited, and the portion south to 903 is Lake Drive.

PennEast Pipeline The Kidder Township Supervisors passed a resolution opposing the PennEast pipeline. The proposed PennEast Pipeline will pass through the county adversely impacting many property owners and community tax revenues. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100-foot wide right-of-way, thereby limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Located in the Marcellus shale region, Carbon County has adversely impacted this way.The Nature Conservancy ‚Äì Pennsylvania Chapter, Natural Gas Pipelines Pennsylvania Energy Impacts Assessment, December 16, 2011The Nature Conservancy, Marcellus Shale Gas Development in Bradford County, December 16, 2011 The Carbon County Planning Commission and Carbon County Commissioners have stated opposition to the pipeline project. The pipeline adversely impacts: Penn Forest Township, Kidder Township, Towamensing Township, and Lower Towamensing Township. The Township Supervisors in all four townships passed resolutions opposing the pipeline. The pipeline's impact on property tax revenues will also adversely impact the school district by depressing revenues. Transportation Kidder Township is served by two Interstate highways. Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension) passes north‚Äìsouth through the township while Interstate 80 passes east‚Äìwest through the township. The two highways meet at the Pocono interchange. State highways serving Kidder Township include Pennsylvania Route 534, which passes east‚Äìwest through the southern portion of the township; Pennsylvania Route 903, which passes through the southeast corner of the township; and Pennsylvania Route 940, which passes east‚Äìwest through the northern portion of the township parallel to I-80 and connects to I-80 and I-476 at the Pocono interchange. The Reading, Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Lehigh Division line pass through the western portion of Kidder Township. Martz Trailways has a stop in Kidder Township near the Pocono interchange of Interstate 476 for service between Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Allentown, Quakertown, and Philadelphia.

The whole valley was owned and subdivided into separate lots by the historically important Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company (locally called \\"the Old Company\\") which likely settled some structures on the lands by 1827. Lansford grew with the development of local anthracite coal mines, and was named after Asa Lansford Foster, who was an advocate for merging the small \\"patch towns\\" that developed in the area surrounding the anthracite coal mines. The population was 3,941 at the 2010 Census, a steep decline from a high of 9,632 at the 1930 census common to many mining towns in northeastern Pennsylvania. History Lansford's first school was opened in 1847 on Abbott Street. Lansford's first church, the Welsh Congregational, was built in 1850 and still stands today on West Abbott Street. 1893 USGS map centered on the three parallel ridges that run SW-to-NE but pinch down and converge into a steep valley along the Lehigh Valley The old No. 9 Mine and Museum in Lansford, a deep mine which operated from 1855 to 1972, is now open as a tourist attraction offering tours of the mine and a wealth of information on local mining history. A museum occupying the mine's former Wash Shanty building on the site displays a large collection of mining artifacts. One of the local mine bosses, John P. Jones, was murdered in Lansford, reportedly in connection with labor union strife, attributed to members of a secret society known as the Molly Maguires, many of whom were put on trial and hanged in Carbon and Schuylkill Counties during the mid- to late 1870s. Lansford was the home of the first Commercial Cable Television system in the United States. The Lansford Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

In the past, it developed early industries because of water power from the Lehigh River. With the location of a repair facility here and its regional operations, the Lehigh Valley Railroad became for years a major employer of thousands of people from the area. Post-World War II railroad and industry restructuring led to job and population losses. From a peak of nearly 7,000 in 1940, the population was 5,500 at the 2010 census. Lehighton is the most populous borough in Carbon County and still the business hub of the county. History At the time of the first European's encounters with historic American Indian tribes, this area was part of the shared hunting territory of the Iroquoian Susquehannock and the Algonquian Lenape (also called the Delaware, after their language and territory along the Delaware River) peoples, who were often at odds. Relatives of the peoples of New England and along the St. Lawrence valley of Canada, the Delaware bands occupied much of the coastal mid-Atlantic area in Delaware, New Jersey, Eastern Pennsylvania and lower eastern New York, including Long Island. The Susquehannock confederacy's homelands were mainly along the Susquehanna River, from the Mohawk Valley in lower New York southerly to the Chesapeake and Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, but may have ranged into the 'empty lands're: The term 'empty lands': Swedish, Dutch, and French explorers all reported the lands west of the Allegheny Ridge and south of the shores of Eastern Lake Erie (the Erie people's territory west of the Ohio and Allegheny River valleys [i.e. Central and Eastern and lower Ohio; including parts of left bank Kentucky.]) to be empty of population; hunting grounds which may have been shared by tribes as diverse as the Iroquois, Creek, Shawnee, Miami, Erie, Susquehannock, Delaware peoples, and possibly some of the tribes around the Potomac. By the time the English trappers and traders pushed West into the Ohio Country, the territories had been claimed by the Iroquois--who'd defeated and broken their relatives -- the Erie and Susquehannocks, while adopting survivors (including remnant bands of Susquehannocks) and asserting their own control over the Leni Lenape tributary tribe. of West Virginia, Eastern Ohio, and Western Pennsylvania. The Dutch and Swedes first settled the Delaware Valley, and found the area north of the Lehigh Gap to be lightly occupied, probably by transients, but traveled regularly by the Susquehannock. This tribe traveled quite a bit according to the American Heritage Book of Indians, including being described in lofty terms by John Smith when a band visited the new Jamestown, Virginia colony. In the decades of the Beaver Wars in the mid-1600s, the Susquehannocks conquered and made the Lenape a tributary tribe -- and also nearly inflicted an overwhelming defeat on the powerful Iroquois Confederacy,. Shortly thereafter, the Susquehannocks suffered a reversal, falling first to epidemic disease that raged for three years which killed off perhaps 90% of their population, and a series of battles on most of their frontiers as various enemies took advantage. This vacated the southeastern and central Pennsylvania regions for the Delaware peoples. However, all tribes were thereafter displaced westwards by continued colonial growth. Delaware dominance at the time of European colonization is why William Penn's settlers adopted Lenape Lenki (Delaware) names for landscape features, and less than a handful of Susquehannock names. Lehighton was built on the site of the German Moravian Brethren's mission station \\"Gnadenh√ºtten\\" (cabins of grace) founded in 1746. It was established as a mission to the Lenape by Moravians from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, lower on the Lehigh River.\\"History\\" , Lehighton Borough official website The German name was transcribed as \\"Canatanheat\\" by missionary John Brainerd.Thomas Brainerd, John Brainerd: The Life of John Brainerd: The Brother of David Brainerd, and His Successor as Missionary to the Indians of New Jersey ..., Presbyterian Publication Committee, 1865, p. 197.

Suspecting the Lenape of being allied with the British, the militia killed 96 unarmed men, women, and children in what became better known as the Gnadenhutten Massacre.) The Lehigh River was a source of water power for developing industries in the 19th century. Lehighton had silk and lace mills, a meat-packing house, shirt factory, automatic-press works, car shops, stoneworks, and foundries. In 1900, the population was 4,629 people. By 1940, it had reached 6,615. The coming of the railroad made it easier for residents to get their products to major markets. For many years, the Lehigh Valley Railroad had a major repair facility in Lehighton. The coming of the railroad was a major economic boost for the town. It was the area's largest company, employing several thousand workers at the repair facilities or operating and maintaining the railroad. Restructuring in the railroad industry led to the repair facilities being moved to another location. Lost jobs meant that some people had to relocate for work. The Lehighton downtown declined after the Carbon Plaza Mall was built in nearby Mahoning Township. Suburban housing developed, pulling more businesses from downtown. After struggling for three decades, the downtown is experiencing a rebirth as people appreciate the qualities of a compact central location, royalty and historic architecture. The town holds an annual civic event, \\"Bike Night\\", featuring more than 28,000 motorcyclists. \\"Bike Night\\" first started in the borough of Lehighton. In 2013, Lehighton moved its \\"Bike Night\\" out of the downtown park across from the borough office to a park called \\"The Grove\\" located on Iron Street between South 7th and 8th Street. In 2015, \\"Bike Night\\" was moved again. However, this time \\"Bike Night\\" moved out of the Lehighton Borough. \\"Bike Night\\" of 2015 was located in Franklin Township, which is located a few miles outside of the borough. This is the first time since the first annual event that it was not held within the Lehighton borough itself. In late September through October, the Country Junction store sponsors \\"The Great Pocono Pumpkin Festival\\". It features hayrides, walks in haunted woods, and cornfield mazes.

It is located in the Coal Region of the state, and is on the outskirts of the Lehigh Valley. The borough's population was 5,414 at the 2010 census.  History  Native Americans lived in the area that is now Palmerton for many years. Early European settlers established the villages of Hazard and Little Gap, which were part of Lower Towamensing Township. There was also an Underground Railroad station there. Palmerton was officially incorporated in 1912. In 1912, the New Jersey Zinc Company located a Zinc smelting operation (now the West Plant) here, in order to take advantage of the anthracite coal being mined just north of Palmerton and the zinc mines in Franklin, New Jersey. The town was named after New Jersey Zinc's then-President, Stephen S. Palmer, though Palmer was reportedly not pleased with having his name on the town. A second location, the East Plant, was established on the other side of town in 1911. Though other industries, such as several garment manufacturing shops, came to Palmerton, the zinc company was the major employer for most of the town's history. Much of the population came to the site, principally from Eastern Europe, in order to work in the zinc plants. Zinc smelting was ended in 1980 due to a poor zinc market and environmental regulation. The West Plant was demolished in 2010. The East Plant continues to operate at reduced capacity, processing electric arc furnace dust into zinc calcine. The Palmer House, a five-story Senior Citizens residence at 360 Delaware Avenue is on the site of the former Palm Theater.

The layout of Palmerton's streets and alleys is extremely regular, because most of the town was planned and built by the New Jersey Zinc Company. Avenues, which run east to west, contain the majority of addresses and are named for colleges and universities. Streets, running perpendicular, are numbered from First Street in the west to Eighth Street in the east.

Superfund  Palmerton is currently the location of the Palmerton Zinc Superfund site. It was added to the National Priority List in 1983. The site is broken down into four Operable Units: the defoliated slope of Blue Mountain, the cinder banks, the soil in town, and the ground and surface water. The remediation process in Palmerton has been contentious. Both the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the citizens' group Palmerton Citizens for a Clean Environment (PCCE) believe that extensive cleanup of the town's soil is necessary to protect human health. On the other hand, many citizens, including the Pro-Palmerton Coalition (PPC), argue that the health risks are exaggerated and that the town's Superfund status stigmatizes it. Both groups, as well as other stakeholders, are part of a Superfund Community Advisory Group called the Palmerton Environmental Task Force.

It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 613 at the 2010 census. History Aaronsburg was founded in 1786 by Aaron Levy, of which the town is named for him. It is the first town in Pennsylvania (and possibly in the United States) laid out by and named after a Jew. He laid out the town of right in the geographic center of the state, with hopes of it becoming a major settlement. Its orderly planned and aligned streets were designed that the town might one day be the county seat. This, however, never occurred due to the lack of water. The current county seat is Bellefonte. Levy was a prominent Jewish merchant who immigrated to Pennsylvania from Amsterdam sometime between 1760 and 1770 to trade with the native peoples and furnished supplies to the proprietary government. After Treaty of Fort Stanwix was signed in 1768, he went west in the land rush and settled at the west branches of the Susquehanna River. There he opened a store to buy and sell to local farmers and native peoples. During the American Revolutionary War, he moved back to Lancaster. As a creditor, Levy was a major financier of the Continental Congress during the conflict, with his loans never fully being repaid. In June 1779, Levy bought a tract of 334 acres in Center County known as the Alexander Grant warranty. Upon this he laid out and planned what would become Aaronsburg. A plot of ground named Aaron's Square was reserved by the founder for public uses, and one of the streets was named Rachel's Way in honor of his wife. On November 16, 1789, Levy gave to the trustees of the Salem Evangelical Church a lot upon which to erect a church and schoolhouse. In 1949 a pageant was held to celebrate Aaronsburg's unique history and namesake. Aaron Levy, a Jewish merchant from Philadelphia, presented members of Salem Lutheran Church with a pewter communion set as a gift. This unusual gesture inspired many, and 50,000 people descended upon Aaronsburg to commemorate it. Attendees included Ralph Bunche, Cornel Wilde, and, later, Ronald Reagan. A short film and a book \\"The Aaronsburg Story\\" by Arthur H. Lewis were written about this event, published in 1955.

It was created in 1993 to publish stories with more graphic or adult content, which did not fit within the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority or DC's primary superhero brand, thus allowing more creative freedom. These comics were free to contain explicit violence, substance abuse, sexuality, nudity, profanity, and other controversial subjects, similar to films and TV shows intended for adult audiences. Following a series of editorial restructurings in the 2010s, DC discontinued it in January 2020, instead publishing later \\"mature readers\\" work under the \\"DC\\" label. Although its initial publications were primarily in the horror and fantasy genres, over time it also published works dealing with crime, social commentary, speculative fiction, biography, and other genres. Originally publishing a mix of company-owned work based on DC's existing characters, and creator-owned work, its focus shifted to the latter. It pioneered in North America the publishing model in which monthly series sold through comic book shops are periodically collected into editions which are kept in print for bookstore sale. Several Vertigo series won the comics industry's Eisner Award, including the \\"best continuing series\\" of various years (The Sandman, Preacher, 100 Bullets, Y: The Last Man, and Fables).

In the mid-1980s, Berger was editor of such DC titles as Wonder Woman and Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld, and began recruiting writers from the UK, including Neil Gaiman, Jamie Delano, Peter Milligan, and Grant Morrison.\\"MEDIA; At House of Comics, a Writer's Champion\\" (p. 2), by Dana Jennings, The New York Times, September 15, 2003 She \\"found their sensibility and point of view to be refreshingly different, edgier and smarter\\" than those of most American comics writers. Berger edited several new or revived series with these writers and Alan Moore (a British writer hired by editor Len Wein), including superhero/science fiction series such as Animal Man, Doom Patrol vol. 2, and Shade, the Changing Man vol. 2, fantasy series The Sandman vol. 2, and horror titles Hellblazer and The Saga of the Swamp Thing.retitled Swamp Thing vol. 2 from issue #39-on She also edited limited series such as Kid Eternity, Black Orchid (Gaiman's first work for DC) and The Books of Magic limited series. These six ongoing titles, all of which carried a \\"Suggested for Mature Readers\\" label on their covers,Hellblazer from issue #1 (Jan. 1988), Doom Patrol from vol. 2, #37 (Oct. 1990), Shade, the Changing Man from vol. 2, #1 (July 1990), The Sandman vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1989), Animal Man from #51 (Sept. 1992) and Swamp Thing, initially reading simply \\"For Mature Readers\\", from vol. 2, #57 (Feb. 1987) shared a sophistication-driven sensibility the comics fan media dubbed \\"the Bergerverse\\". In a 1992 editorial meeting with Levitz, publisher Jenette Kahn, and managing editor Dick Giordano, Berger was given the mandate to place these titles under an imprint that, as Berger described, would \\"do something different in comics and help the medium 'grow up'\\". Several DC titles bearing the age advisory, such as Green Arrow, Blackhawk, and The Question (the last two cancelled before the launch of Vertigo), did not make the transition to the new imprint.Green Arrow (vol. 2) ran for 137 issues, concluding in October 1998. Mike Grell's final issue on the series was #80, so the loss of the label did *not*, contrary to some sources, coincide with Grell's departure. Meanwhile, Disney Comics and former DC editor Art Young had been developing an imprint to be called Touchmark Comics, analogous to Disney's mature-audiences Touchstone Pictures studio. This project was abandoned following the so-called \\"Disney Implosion\\" of 1991. Young and those works were brought into the Vertigo fold, allowing Berger to expand the imprint's publishing plans with the limited series Enigma, Sebastian O, Mercy, and Shadows Fall.\\"Interview with Karen Berger\\" in Advance Comics #49 (Capital City Distribution, January 1993) Initial year Vertigo was launched in January 1993 with a mixture of existing ongoing series continued under the new imprint, new ongoing series, new limited series, and single-volume collections or graphic novels. Their publishing plan for the first year involved two new titles ‚Äì whether ongoing/limited series or one-shots ‚Äì each month. The existing series (cover date March 1993) were Shade, the Changing Man (starting with #33), The Sandman (#47), Hellblazer (#63), Animal Man (#57), Swamp Thing (#129), and Doom Patrol (#64, with new writer Rachel Pollack). The first comic book published under the \\"Vertigo\\" imprint was the first issue of Death: The High Cost of Living, a 3-issue series by Neil Gaiman and Chris Bachalo. The second new title was the first issue of Enigma, an 8-issue limited series initially planned to launch Touchmark, written by Peter Milligan (also author of Shade, the Changing Man) and drawn by Duncan Fegredo, the artist from Grant Morrison's earlier Kid Eternity limited series. The following month saw the debut of Sandman: Mystery Theatre by Matt Wagner and Steven T. Seagle, and illustrated primarily by Guy Davis, described as \\"playing the '30s with a '90s feel... haunting, film noir- ish...,\\" and starring original Sandman Wesley Dodds in a title whose \\"sensibilities echo crime genre fiction.\\" Joining it was J. M. DeMatteis and Paul Johnson's 64-page one-shot Mercy. New series that began in the months that followed include Kid Eternity (ongoing) by Ann Nocenti and Sean Phillips (continuing from the earlier Morrison-penned limited series), Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell's 3-issue steampunk limited series Sebastian O (another ex- Touchmark project), Skin Graft by Jerry Prosser and Warren Pleece, The Last One by DeMatteis and Dan Sweetman, Jonah Hex: Two-Gun Mojo by Tim Truman and Sam Glanzman, Black Orchid (ongoing) by Dick Foreman and Jill Thompson (continuing from the earlier Gaiman/McKean limited series), The Extremist by Peter Milligan and Ted McKeever, Scarab by John Smith with Scot Eaton and Mike Barreiro, and The Children's Crusade, a crossover involving several of the imprint's ongoing series. The Books of Magic limited series was relaunched as an ongoing series written by John Ney Rieber, and illustrated by Peter Gross (later also writer), Gary Amaro, and Peter Snejbjerg. Although the books did not have a consistent \\"house style\\" of art, the cover designs of early Vertigo series featured a uniform trade dress with a vertical bar along the left side, which included the imprint logo, pricing, date, and issue numbers. The design layout continued with very little variation until issues cover-dated July 2002 (including Fables #1) which introduced an across-the-top layout ahead of 2003's \\"Vertigo X\\" 10th anniversary celebration. The \\"distinctive design\\" was intended to be used on \\"all Vertigo books except the hardcovers, trade paperbacks, and graphic novels.\\" Berger noted that DC was \\"very\\" committed to the line, having put a \\"lot of muscle behind\\" promoting it, including a promotional launch kit made available to \\"[r]etailers who order[ed] at least 25 copies of the February issue of Sandman [#47],\\" a \\"platinum edition\\" variant cover for Death: The High Cost of Living #1 and a 75-cent Vertigo Preview comic featuring a specially written seven-page Sandman story by Gaiman and Kent Williams. In addition, a 16-page Vertigo Sampler was also produced and bundled with copies of Capital City Distribution's Advance Comics solicitation index. Vertigo publications generally did not take place in a shared universe. However, several of the early series which had begun as part of the main DC Universe had a \\"crossover\\" in 1993-1994: The Children's Crusade. The event‚Äî\\"did not yield smashing results\\" or garner many positive reviews, in large part due to its \\"gimmicky\\" nature, which ran counter to Vertigo's quirky, non-mainstream appeal and customer-base.Anatomy of the Crossover #5: \\"DC/Vertigo's The Children's Crusade: Child Culture and Reflexivity, Suggested For Mature Readers\\" by Robert A. Emmons, Jr., November 1, 2005. Accessed May 29, 2008 The event was defended as \\"no marketing ploy\\" by one of the event's editors, Lou Stathis, who wrote of his dislike of the often \\"crass manipulation\\" of crossover events, defending The Children's Crusade as having come not from marketing, but the writers' minds, and therefore being \\"story-driven\\" rather than manipulative.Lou Stathis, writing in the Vertigo column On the Ledge. Quoted in Anatomy of the Crossover #5: \\"DC/Vertigo's The Children's Crusade: Child Culture and Reflexivity, Suggested For Mature Readers\\" by Robert A. Emmons, Jr., November 1, 2005 . Accessed May 29, 2008 The crossover did not become an annual event, however‚Äîindeed, \\"annuals\\" linked to Vertigo series rarely reappeared after this event. Works previously published by DC under other imprints, but which fit the general character of Vertigo, have been reprinted under this imprint. This has included V for Vendetta, earlier issues of Vertigo's ongoing launch series, and books from discontinued imprints such as Transmetropolitan (initially under DC's short-lived sci-fi Helix imprint) and A History of Violence (originally part of the Paradox Press line). Two of the new ongoing series did not last long; Kid Eternity was cancelled after 16 issues, and Black Orchid continued for only 22. Sandman Mystery Theatre and most of the pre-existing series continued for several years, including Sandman which reached its planned conclusion with #75. Hellblazer was the last of the original ongoing series to be canceled, ceasing publication in February 2013 with #300.  Middle period  As the imprint's initial ongoing series came to their ends, new series were launched to replace them, with varying degrees of success. The Sandman was replaced following its completion by The Dreaming (1996‚Äì2001) and The Sandman Presents, which featured stories about the characters from Neil Gaiman's series, written by other creators. Other long-running series have been The Invisibles by Grant Morrison and various artists (1994‚Äì2000); Preacher by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon (1995‚Äì2000); Transmetropolitan by Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson (1997‚Äì2002); 100 Bullets by Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso (1999‚Äì2009); Lucifer by Mike Carey, Peter Gross, and Ryan Kelly (2000‚Äì2006); Y: The Last Man by Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra (2002‚Äì2008); DMZ by Brian Wood and Riccardo Burchielli (2005‚Äì2012); and Fables by Bill Willingham, Mark Buckingham, and various other artists (2002‚Äì2015), which launched spin-offs including Jack of Fables by Willingham, Lilah Sturges (credited as \\"Matthew Sturges\\"), and various artists (2006‚Äì2011), and Fairest by Willingham and various artists (2012‚Äì2015). The financial success of many Vertigo titles relied not on monthly issue sales, but on the subsequent \\"trade paperback\\" editions that reprinted the monthly comics in volumes, which were also sold in general-interest bookshops. Vertigo's success in popularizing this approach led to a wider take-up in the American comics industry of routinely reprinting monthly series in this format. Limited series (ideal for later collection) and original graphic novels made up the majority of the imprint's output, with trade paperback sales accounting for a substantial segment of the imprint's sales. =Vertigo Visions= An irregular series of self-contained short stories featuring characters from the DC Universe, reinterpreted or recontextualized. *Vertigo Visions: The Geek (June 1993) by Rachel Pollack and Mike Allred *Vertigo Visions: Phantom Stranger (October 1993) by Alisa Kwitney and Guy Davis *Vertigo Visions: Doctor Occult (July 1994) by Dave Louapre and Dan Sweetman *Vertigo Visions: Prez (September 1995) by Ed Brubaker and Eric Shanower *Vertigo Visions: Tomahawk (July 1998) by Rachel Pollack and Tom Yeates *Vertigo Visions: Doctor Thirteen (September 1998) by Matt Howarth and Michael Avon OemingDetails from the Grand Comics Database.

(an eight-page Endless Nights Preview issue was also released before the hardcover). Also highlighted and previewed were two original graphic novels: Lovecraft (based on a screenplay by Hans Rodionoff and adapted by Keith Giffen with art by Enrique Breccia) took the conceit that H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos creatures were real, to paint a highly fictionalized biographic portrait of the titular author, while Howard Chaykin and David Tischman's Barnum! (with art by Niko Henrichon) similarly drifted in the realms of fictionalized biography, but did not stray into the horror/supernatural world. The tale of Barnum: In Secret Service to the USA saw the celebrated showman saving the life of President Grover Cleveland and (with his circus charges, including original Siamese twins Chang and Eng) matching wits against the \\"evil\\" Nikola Tesla.

Rich, until May 2017 when Mark Doyle became the new editor.http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2017/05/05/dc-entertainment-expands- editorial-leadership-team In 2018, DC Comics announced a \\"line-wide relaunch and rebranding\\" as \\"DC Vertigo\\", including 11 new ongoing titles planned for the coming year, under Doyle's editorship. These included a new sub-imprint based on Neil Gaiman's Sandman with four new ongoing series, announced in March, and seven new series announced in June. The relaunch experienced a number of complications, however. Border Town by Eric M. Esquivel and Ramon Villalobos dealt with immigration and Latino identity, for which Esquivel received death threats in advance of its publication. The series was well- received by critics, but after four issues were published, Esquivel was accused of sexually and emotionally abusing a former partner. Villalobos and colorist Tamra Bonvillain withdrew from the project, and DC cancelled the series, including issues that were ready for publication. Meanwhile, Second Coming by Mark Russell and Richard Pace came under criticism from Christians and conservatives who considered its announced premise ‚Äì in which Jesus Christ returns and lives as a roommate with a modern-day superhero ‚Äì blasphemous and offensive. The series was cancelled before the first issue was published; Russell and Pace later published the series to critical acclaim through Ahoy Comics. Safe Sex by Tina Horn and Mike Dowling was also cancelled before its debut, and later published as SFSX by Image Comics. In June 2019, DC announced that, as part of a consolidation into a unified branding, the Vertigo imprint would be discontinued in January 2020. The DC Zoom and DC Ink imprints for children and young adolescents were also eliminated. Under the new plan, all of the company's comics would be published under the \\"DC\\" brand, and categorized by intended reader age: DC Kids (8‚Äì12 years), DC (13+), and DC Black Label (17+). The Sandman-related titles retained their new branding as \\"The Sandman Universe\\".

Editing Doug Moench's The Wanderers, Berger was joined on issue #5 (Oct 1988) by co-editor Art Young, who would also later be instrumental in the formation of Vertigo. Grant Morrison's Animal Man and the ultra-dark Arkham Asylum OGN were swiftly joined on Berger's slate by The Sandman, Skreemer, The Books of Magic, The Nazz and Shade, the Changing Man. Berger continued with The Sandman and Shade during 1992, and saw the pre- Vertigo titles as \\"all [having] some basis in reality.\\" By the early 1990s, \\"[t]he core Vertigo titles had already become their own little enclave,\\" so when Berger returned from maternity leave, she spoke with DC President Jenette Kahn and Executive Editor Dick Giordano, the outcome being a separate imprint to \\"actively expand [the] sensibility\\" of the titles she had been editing. Berger included in the initial Vertigo line-up the five titles she had had some hand in creating or editing (Swamp Thing, Hellblazer, Animal Man, Sandman and Shade) as well as Doom Patrol which she \\"decided to include... because Grant Morrison was working on it and the sensibility was very much like the other series.\\" Berger oversaw the entire Vertigo line, and was promoted to the position of \\"Senior Vice President ‚Äî Executive Editor, Vertigo\\" in July 2006.TimeWarner Newsroom, July 17, 2006.

Her promotion came as Vertigo was said to be equivalent to \\"the fourth largest American comic book publisher\\" in 2005, with Paul Levitz praising her personally as having \\"built Vertigo into an imprint which is simultaneously one of comics' leading creative and commercial successes.\\" In addition, Berger won Eisner Awards for her editing in 1992, 1994 and 1995 for her work on the proto- and early Vertigo titles Sandman, Shade, Kid Eternity, Books of Magic, Death: The High Cost of Living and Sandman Mystery Theatre. Art Young joined Karen Berger to edit pre-Vertigo issues of Animal Man (from issue #3), Hellblazer and Swamp Thing on issues cover-dated November 1988. Two months later, Young also took on the initial issues of The Sandman, before in mid-1990 moving to Doom Patrol, which with Animal Man he edited until early 1991 (also over-seeing the original Books of Magic miniseries along the way). He then left DC to work for Disney in setting up Touchmark, before returning with those projects to Vertigo in early 1993, when he edited debut title Enigma, and later miniseries and one-shots such as Sebastian O, The Extremist, Mercy, Rogan Gosh, The Mystery Play, and Tank Girl: The Moovy. He edited all four of the \\"Vertigo Voices\\" titles in 1995, as well as Shadows Fall, Ghostdancing, Egypt, Millennium Fever and both Tank Girl miniseries. Young's last editorial credit for Vertigo was Flex Mentallo #1 (June 1996). Shelly Bond was a Vertigo Group Editor. Like Young, she has overseen a large number of notable projects during her (almost-)exclusive time working with Vertigo since April 1993. Roeberg took over editorial duties on the second Vertigo issues of both The Sandman and Shade, the Changing Man from Lisa Guastella ‚Äî then Lisa Aufenanger ‚Äî editing those two titles until their respective final issues; she also edited the first 36 issues of the \\"ahead of its time\\" crime/noir series Sandman Mystery Theatre. Between 1993 and 2000, she edited titles exclusively for Vertigo (with one exception ‚Äî the nine issues of Peter Bagge and Gilbert Hernandez's Yeah! (1999‚Äì2000) for DC's imprint Homage), including relatively little known titles and one-shots such as Skin Graft, The Last One, The Heart of the Beast (1994), Mobfire, Terminal City, Menz Insana, The Girl Who Would Be Death, Heavy Liquid, Pulp Fantastic and Accelerate. She also edited the first Vertigo works of Bill Willingham and Ed Brubaker in Proposition Player and Scene of the Crime, and the higher-profile series Moonshadow, Girl, Seekers into the Mystery, The Minx and all issues of House of Secrets (with Jennifer Lee from issue #11). She (co-)edited the final 25 issues of The Dreaming between 1999 and 2001, initially as Shelly Roeberg, and latterly as Shelly Bond (after marrying artist Philip Bond), and most of the Sandman Presents... miniseries and one- shots. From 2000, she has continued to edit most of the highest-profile Vertigo titles, including almost all of Mike Carey's Lucifer (with Mariah Huehner) and the entirety of Ed Brubaker's Deadenders, Howard Chaykin & David Tischman's American Century, Jonathan Vankin's The Witching, Si Spencer's Books of Magick: Life During Wartime, Steven T. Seagle and Kelley Jones' The Crusades and Bill Willingham's Fables (to date). She oversaw the first fourteen issues of American Virgin, the first eleven of Jack of Fables, the first two Vertigo Pop! miniseries, Paul Dini's Zatanna: Everyday Magic and the innovative Vertical one-shot. She helped shepherd the OGNs Barnum!, Confessions of a Blabbermouth, 1001 Nights of Snowfall, God Save the Queen, The Little Endless Storybook, Re-Gifters, Sandman: Endless Nights and Silverfish as well as both Bite Club miniseries, Faker, Grip: The Strange World of Men, My Faith in Frankie and House of Secrets: Facade. From 2007, she had also been heavily involved in the new DC imprint \\"Minx\\", but continued to edit titles for Vertigo, including the new 2007/8 series House of Mystery, Vinyl Underground and Young Liars. Tom Peyer was, by 1990 editing (with Karen Berger) what would become the pillars of Vertigo: Hellblazer, Sandman (taking over from Art Young), Swamp Thing and Shade, the Changing Man. He soon left Swamp Thing to Stuart Moore, however with issue #100, and Moore would edit and co-edit the remaining 71 issues of that title, including the switch from DC to Vertigo. Peyer moved to Doom Patrol and Animal Man, which he edited during the transition from DC to Vertigo, before moving to edit the initial issues of Kid Eternity and Black Orchid as well as two \\"Vertigo Visions\\" one-shots. Peyer left editing behind in 1994, returning to DC as a writer. Moore edited a wide range of Vertigo titles between 1993 and 2000, including the transitional issues of Hellblazer as well as Swamp Thing, the first fifteen issues of The Invisibles, the first seventeen issues of Preacher and the first thirty issues of Transmetropolitan. In 1996, Moore won the Eisner Award for best editor, for his work on Swamp Thing, Invisibles and Preacher. He edited the first issues of Books of Magic, and both Books of Faerie miniseries (with Cliff Chiang), and returned to the main Books of Magic title for a further 20+ issues with Chiang in 1998. He also edited several miniseries for both Vertigo and Vertigo's sister imprint Helix. Axel Alonso (who would later move to Marvel Comics) began his editorial career at Vertigo on Animal Man, Black Orchid, Doom Patrol and Hellblazer, and also edited the opening issues of Brian Azzarello and Eduardo Risso's 100 Bullets and the final issues of Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon's Preacher. Will Dennis was promoted from assistant editor to editor upon Alonso's departure. He took over the editing of 100 Bullets and later assumed the reins of Vertigo's biggest hit series since Preacher, Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra's Y: The Last Man. Dennis has been responsible for bringing writers Brian Wood (DMZ) and Jason Aaron (Scalped) to Vertigo. He teamed writer Andy Diggle and artist Jock on their breakout series The Losers. Dennis edited Vaughan's commercially successful graphic novel Pride of Baghdad. He was the editor who presided over the Vertigo Crime line of graphic novels. Jonathan Vankin was hired as an editor at Vertigo in 2004 after previously writing two of the line's Vertigo Pop miniseries and several entries in the Paradox Press \\"Big Book\\" series as well as several other non- comics works . His contributions to the line as an editor have included the series, The Exterminators and Testament. For the latter, he brought media theorist Douglas Rushkoff to Vertigo. Taking over editing of Hellblazer from Will Dennis, he hired acclaimed Scottish crime novelist Denise Mina to write the title for 13 issues. He brought Harvey Pekar to Vertigo, where Pekar published the graphic novel The Quitter as well as eight issues of Pekar's long-running American Splendor autobiographical series. Vankin also edited the graphic novels Incognegro by Mat Johnson and The Alcoholic by novelist and essayist Jonathan Ames. Writers Although the \\"mature reader\\" works of Alan Moore, Grant Morrison (with Jamie Delano and Neil Gaiman) under the DC imprint paved the way for Vertigo's launch, neither author was part of the initial line-up. Indeed, Moore never produced work for the Vertigo imprint ‚Äî having refused to work for parent company DC in the late 1980s ‚Äî although his DC-published Swamp Thing work and V for Vendetta reprint-maxiseries were subsequently collected as Vertigo-issued TPBs, while the Hellblazer solo title dealt with the character co-created by Moore, but never written by him. =Launch writers= Grant Morrison, whose pre-Vertigo work on Animal Man and Doom Patrol was similarly retroactively branded as \\"Vertigo\\" when collected, also wrote two issues of Hellblazer pre-Vertigo, which are collected in a 2005 trade paperback. Wrote three volumes of The Invisibles between 1994 and 2000. In addition, he has produced a number of miniseries including Sebastian O (1993), the Doom Patrol spin-off Flex Mentallo (1996), Seaguy (2004), Vimanarama (2005), We3 (2004‚Äì2005) and \\"Joe The Barbarian\\" (2010) as well as the longer miniseries The Filth (2002‚Äì2003). He collaborated with writer Mark Millar on five issues of Swamp Thing in 1994, produced two one-shots ‚Äî The Mystery Play (1994) and Kill Your Boyfriend (1995) ‚Äî and contributed to several anthologies. Of the eight debut Vertigo titles, half of them were the work of two authors. Neil Gaiman, who went on to become a New York Times best-selling novelist, came to prominence four years pre-Vertigo with the launch of The Sandman for DC Comics, a title that became the backbone of the initial Vertigo line-up. Gaiman's work on the first The Books of Magic miniseries (also released as a DC title, 1990‚Äì91) lay the groundwork for the long-running Vertigo Universe series of the same name, which featured young wizard Timothy Hunter. Peter Milligan, who began his career at 2000 AD, before working briefly for both Pacific Comics and Eclipse Comics, contributed two titles (one quarter of the initial line-up; the same as Gaiman) to the Vertigo launch. His Shade, the Changing Man was launched by DC and ran 70 issues (July 1990) ‚Äì #70 (April 1996), by which time it was under the Vertigo imprint. He also wrote the creator-owned eight-issue miniseries Enigma (1993). Milligan and Brett Ewins's Skreemer, written for DC pre-Vertigo (1989) was subsequently collected by Vertigo, while his work on the DC character Human Target was released entirely by Vertigo as a four-issue miniseries (1999), an original graphic novel (2002), and an ongoing series (2003‚Äì2005). Milligan also produced the one-shots The Eaters and Face in 1995 for the \\"Vertigo Voices\\" sub-imprint, and a number of other miniseries, including The Extremist (1993), Tank Girl: The Odyssey (1995), Egypt (1995‚Äì1996), Girl (1996), The Minx (1998‚Äì1999), and Vertigo Pop!: London (2003). Garth Ennis (Hellblazer) and Jamie Delano (Animal Man) were two other launch authors who went on to great success with Vertigo and elsewhere. Ennis' best-known Vertigo work was his and artist Steve Dillon's creator-owned Preacher, which ran for 66 issues and six spin-off specials between 1995 and 2000, while Ennis' prolific work on Hellblazer rivals initial-series author Delano. Ennis has also written several miniseries for Vertigo, including Goddess (1995‚Äì1996), Pride & Joy (1997), Unknown Soldier (1997), and Adventures in the Rifle Brigade (2001‚Äì2002), as well as eight one-shot War Stories between 2001 and 2003. Two of his pre- Vertigo works ‚Äî True Faith (serialized in Crisis) and the four-issue DC/Helix miniseries Bloody Mary (1996‚Äì1197) ‚Äî have had collections released under the Vertigo label. Alan Moore, co-creator of the jaded, chain-smoking, modern-day British wizard John Constantine in Swamp Thing, hand-picked Jamie Delano to continue Constantine's adventures as star of the DC title Hellblazer (1988‚Äì2013), but Delano left that series in 1991 before the launch of Vertigo. Delano did write Vertigo's Animal Man#51‚Äì79 (1992‚Äì1995), and produced 19 issues of Outlaw Nation (2000‚Äì02) and the 12-issue miniseries 2020 Visions (1997‚Äì1998), plus two Hellblazer miniseries ‚Äî The Horrorist (1995‚Äì1996) and Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood (2000). He also wrote the one-shot titles Tainted (1995) and Hell Eternal (1998), the miniseries Ghostdancing (1995) and Cruel and Unusual (1999), contributed to anthology titles, and with Gaiman and Kwitney wrote The Children's Crusade #2. Rachel Pollack, who was writing Doom Patrol when Vertigo launched, continued on that title until #87 (Feb. 1995), the final issues. She also penned two \\"Vertigo Visions\\" specials ‚Äî 1993's The Geek and 1998's Tomahawk. Nancy A. Collins, who wrote Swamp Thing #110‚Äì138 (Aug. 1991 ‚Äì Dec. 1993), also wrote the 1996 one-shot Dhampire: Stillborn. =Later writers= John Ney Reiber has produced most of his output for Vertigo, working exclusively for the company between 1994 and 2000. Reiber wrote the first fifty issues of the first ongoing The Books of Magic series (May 1994 ‚Äì July 1998), as well as a number of miniseries, mostly set in the wider Vertigo universe (and particularly the Sandman/Books of Magic sections) ‚Äì Mythos: The Final Tour (1996‚Äì7), Hellblazer/The Books of Magic (1997‚Äì8), The Trenchcoat Brigade (1999), The Books of Faerie: Molly's Story (1999). Reiber's Shadows Fall (with artist John Van Fleet) was a self-created horror story grounded in a reality which made the tale \\"all the more creepy than if the story was played out in the realm and scope of superheroes.\\"Review of Shadows Fall by Rena Tom. Retrieved June 1, 2008. Reiber's Tell Me Dark, produced for DC, was collected in softcover by Vertigo, and he also contributed to various anthologies. J. M. DeMatteis began his comics career on DC's House of Mystery title over a decade before the formation of Vertigo, and later became one of the earliest Vertigo creators thanks in large part to his proposed Touchmark projects. DeMatteis' Mercy (1993) one-shot and miniseries The Last One both debuted in 1993, with reprints of two creator-owned Epic Comics projects following in subsequent years: his 198587 creator-owned maxiseries Moonshadow was reprinted between 1994‚Äì5, with the miniseries Blood: A Tale seeing print again in 1996‚Äì7. DeMatteis also wrote fifteen issues of Seekers into the Mystery (1996‚Äì7) for Vertigo. Mike Carey, having started his American comics career with Caliber Comics in the mid-1990s catapulted to prominence in March 1999 with the first issue of his Sandman spin-off miniseries Sandman Presents: Lucifer, which would lead to an ongoing series a year later and considerable praise and projects for Carey. A second Sandman miniseries, Sandman Presents: Petrefax (2000), soon followed, before the June 2000 debut of Lucifer. Neil Gaiman's preferred Sandman spin-off had not had an easy time being published, due to its title and main character, but Carey was able to helm it for a Sandman-equalling 75 issues (and a 2002 one-shot: Nirvana) for 6 years. During this time, Carey also wrote the hardcover OGN Sandman Presents: The Furies (2002), over 40 issues of Hellblazer between 2002 and 2006 and a 2005 Hellblazer original graphic novel, All His Engines. He also wrote a non- Sandman miniseries, My Faith in Frankie (2004), the comicbook adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere (2005‚Äì6) and the OGN God Save the Queen (2007). In 2007 he launched the ongoing series Crossing Midnight (2007‚Äì8) and the miniseries Faker (2007‚Äì8). Brian K. Vaughan's first Vertigo work was a short story in 2000's Winter's Edge #3 anthology, which led to him relaunching Swamp Thing (vol. 3) (2000‚Äì01), which lasted for 20 issues. In September 2002, his (and Pia Guerra's) Y: The Last Man launched. It would ultimately run for 60 issues until March 2008. Vaughan also wrote the 2006 OGN Pride of Baghdad for Vertigo. Ed Brubaker's first Vertigo work was on the \\"Vertigo Visions\\" Prez one-shot (1995), and intermittent contributions to a couple of anthology titles preceded his Scene of the Crime (1999), effectively laying the groundwork for his later crime comics. His next Vertigo project, the post- apocalyptic series Deadenders (2000‚Äì01), ran for 16 issues while Brubaker wrote for both Batman and Detective Comics for parent-company DC. His 2001 miniseries Sandman Presents: The Dead Boy Detectives told the story of some incidental Sandman characters, and was later retold by Jill Thompson in manga form (2005). Brubaker subsequently took his Vertigo/crime sensibility to work from WildStorm, Icon and the mainstream DC and Marvel universes. Bill Willingham came to Vertigo after a plethora of small press work in 1999 to launch his poker miniseries Proposition Player (1999‚Äì2000), and contribute to the Sandman universe with a one-shot spy-spoof, Sandman Presents: Merv Pumpkinhead, Agent of D.R.E.A.M. (2000), and a single issue contribution to The Dreaming on-going series. A second Sandman one-shot, The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Dreams... (2001), also led to a 4-issue miniseries, Sandman Presents: The Thessaliad (2002). Willingham's best-known work soon followed, with the July 2001 debut of Fables (with artist Lan Medina). In 2004, he returned to the world of the Sandman with Sandman Presents: Thessaly: Witch for Hire, and 2006 saw the debut of the Vertigo- esque magical ‚Äî but mainstream DCU title ‚Äî Shadowpact and Fables companion series Jack of Fables. In July 2008, with Fables nearing a major turning point in its run, Willingham relaunched House of Mystery as a Vertigo title with Lilah Sturges (then known as Matthew Sturges). Other notable people who have written for Vertigo include Kyle Baker, Warren Ellis, David Lapham, Mark Millar, Brian Azzarello, Paul Pope, James Robinson, and Brian Wood. Artists Several artists have also produced a large amount of notable work for Vertigo, several (Steve Dillon, Pia Guerra, Eduardo Risso and Darick Robertson) mainly producing lengthy runs on individual creator-owned titles (in Guerra's case, Y: The Last Man makes up around 80% of her output to date),Pia Guerra at the Comic Book Database. Retrieved June 2, 2008. but others on a number of titles. Vertigo's main Universe titles, The Sandman, Hellblazer and Swamp Thing, have been particularly artistically diverse, and home to many talents, while the large number of creator-owned miniseries has seen large numbers of individuals producing work for Vertigo. Peter Gross worked on a pre-Vertigo issue of Swamp Thing and an early Vertigo issue of Shade the Changing Man (#36, June 1993) before penciling & inking a story featuring Timothy Hunter in the \\"Children's Crusade\\" crossover Arcana Annual (Jan. 1994). This led to a regular inking role on the newly launched Books of Magic series, taking over as regular penciler and inker with #6; he would stay with the title for most of its run, writing as well as drawing its final 25 issues (1998‚Äì2000). Gross also inked Reiber's Mythos one-shot, and provided full artwork on the first Books of Faerie miniseries (1997) and pencils on the following year's The Books of Faerie: Auberon's Tale (1998). After Books of Magic, Gross moved to Lucifer (beginning with #5, Oct. 2000) and penciled 56 of the remaining issues, as well as inking a handful. He also co-penciled 2005's Constantine: The Official Movie Adaptation and several issues of Douglas Rushkoff's Testament from 2006 to 2007. Dean Ormston has similarly produced a disproportionate amount of his artwork for Vertigo titles, including the lion's share of the alternate reality Books of Magick: Life During Wartime series (2004‚Äì5). His first Vertigo work was as one of several pencilers in the pages of Sandman #62 (Aug 1994), and in 1995 he penciled and inked Peter Milligan's The Eaters one-shot. His artwork appears in most (14) of the non-Peter Gross issues of Mike Carey's Lucifer, and he also handled art duties for Caitlin R. Kiernan's 4-issue The Girl who would be Death (1998‚Äì9). In addition, he has worked on a number of single (and jam) issues of other Vertigo titles, including The Crusades, House of Mystery, The Invisibles, Mythos, Sandman Mystery Theatre, Swamp Thing and Testament between 1994 and 2007. Duncan Fegredo's first major American work was on the 1991 Kid Eternity miniseries with Grant Morrison. A 1992 cover for Doom Patrol similarly fell in Vertigo territory pre-Vertigo, while Fegredo's first \\"true\\" Vertigo work was also on the joint-first new series released by the imprint: Peter Milligan's Enigma. Immediately after the end of the 8-issue series, Fegredo took over as cover artist on Milligan's long-running Shade, the Changing Man (issues #42‚Äì50), collaborated with Milligan on 1995's one-shot Face (Jan) and then returned to cover duties on Shade, producing all but one of the remaining pieces of art. He produced pencils and inks for the miniseries Millennium Fever (1995) and (with Milligan) for Girl (1996). Between 1997 and 2002, he contributed artwork on fill-in issues (or to jam issues) of Crusades, The Dreaming, Flinch, House of Secrets, The Sandman Presents: Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Dreams..., Totems, Weird War Tales and Weird Western Tales. In addition, his cover work graced the 1999 miniseries Sandman Presents: Love Street, six issues of The Books of Magick: Life During Wartime and the first fifteen issues of Mike Carey's Lucifer. Jill Thompson, although primarily known as an artist, has also produced scripts for Vertigo, producing as writer-artist three Sandman tie-ins: The Little Endless Storybook (2001) and two manga retellings of storylines: Death: At Death's Door (2003) and The Dead Boy Detectives (2005). Between 1993 and 1994, she penciled the first six issues of the ongoing Black Orchid series and the 4-issue miniseries Finals (1999). She has contributed ten issues each to the high-profile Vertigo series Sandman (penciling the complete \\"Brief Lives\\" storyline, part 7 of which was the first Vertigo issue) and The Invisibles, and penciled four of the last five issues of Seekers into the Mystery. She has produced fill-in issues of Books of Magic, The Dreaming and Swamp Thing and contributed artwork to the anthology comics Fables #59 (in addition to a story in the hardcover OGN 1001 Nights of Snowfall) and Transmetropolitan: Filth of the City. Jon J Muth, a painter, has produced several lavish volumes for Vertigo, including writing, penciling, inking and coloring the 1998 one-shot Swamp Thing: Roots. Primarily, his Vertigo output has been in collaboration with JM DeMatteis, an issue of Blood: A Tale, the maxiseries Moonshadow (and its coda, Farewell, Moonshadow (1997)) and three issues of Seekers into the Mystery. Muth painted Grant Morrison's The Mystery Play (1994) and the 2002 Lucifer: Nirvana special for Mike Carey. His work also effectively ended Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, Muth painting issue #74, the final issue of The Wake storyline, and second-to- last main issue. The artwork of Charles Vess has infrequently but notably accompanied the words of Neil Gaiman on Vertigo projects, including the 4-issue Stardust (1997‚Äì8) miniseries, later reprinted as an illustrated hardcover book. Vess' work can also be seen in the two Shakespeare adaptations in the pages of The Sandman, the first of which (pre-Vertigo) won the comic and duo the World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story, and the last of which was also the final (75th) issue of the series. Vess also contributed a story to the Fables OGN 1001 Nights of Snowfall, illustrated a Books of Magic cover and produced an issue of The Dreaming (2000). Sean Phillips earliest American comics work was in the pages of pre-Vertigo Hellblazer, and in May 1993 he became one of the early Vertigo artists by illustrating (with assists from Paul Peart and Sean Harrison Scoffield) the entire 16-issue run of Kid Eternity (1993‚Äì4). He drew the covers for twenty-three of the twenty-five issues of the first The Invisibles series and also returned to Hellblazer (switching from artwork and covers to just covers after around 20 issues) between 1995 and 1998. He drew three issues of Shade, the Changing Man (1994), the one-shot Hell Eternal (1995) and the miniseries The Minx as well as inking most of Michael Lark's work on Scene of the Crime. He penciled four issues of the final Invisibles series between 1999 and 2000, produced covers for the Hellblazer Special: Bad Blood miniseries, and shared art chores with John Bolton on the 2001 miniseries User. John Bolton, another frequent Gaiman collaborator has rarely worked with that author directly for Vertigo, but has utilised his characters, including in the OGN Sandman Presents: The Furies and the Books of Magic lead-in Arcana Annual. He also contributed to the Sandman Mystery Theatre annual, and the Fables OGN 1001 Nights of Snowfall. With Sean Phillips, he produced the artwork for Devin Grayson's 2001 miniseries User, and individually fully illustrated the OGN's Menz Insana (1997) and God Save the Queen (2007). Other artists include Chris Bachalo, Mark Buckingham, Guy Davis, Phil Jimenez, Jock, Warren Pleece and Liam Sharp. =Cover artists= Inarguably the name most associated with Vertigo's cover output is the artist who provided all of the covers to the Vertigo's highest profile series (The Sandman series (1989‚Äì96)): Dave McKean. The first 46 of these covers were created for the DC imprint, but McKean's work also includes a number of Sandman-spin-off issues, miniseries and galleries. These include the two Death miniseries and all 60 issues of The Dreaming (1996‚Äì2001). He provided the first 24 DC published covers to Hellblazer, and all 22 covers to the 1993-5 Black Orchid Vertigo series (which spun off from his (and Gaiman's) 1988 DC miniseries). He produced the first cover for Sandman Mystery Theatre and his work was featured in a 1997 artbook incorporating his Sandman covers, \\"Dust Covers: The Collected Sandman Covers, 1989‚Äì1997.\\" In addition, McKean's artwork also graced the inside pages of the public service comic Death Talks about Life (1994), an issue of The Dreaming (#8), two issues of the DC- published Hellblazer (#27 with Gaiman and #40 with Delano) and his and Neil Gaiman's OGN Mr Punch (1994). The duo's Black Orchid was similarly produced for DC, but was retroactively deemed a Vertigo title. Brian Bolland and Glenn Fabry have also produced a large number of iconic covers for the Vertigo line, Fabry probably being best known for his work on one title: Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon's Preacher (and the spin-off miniseries). Bolland, one of the very earliest British creators whose work was brought to America, drew the first 63 covers for Animal Man, mostly for DC, but also the first six Vertigo issues before handing over to a succession of other artists. Bolland also drew the cover for Vertigo's first Doom Patrol issue and for the entire second and third volumes of Morrison's Invisibles (1997‚Äì2000) (and in addition provided artwork for the TPB collections of Morrison's Doom Patrol run, and all volumes of The Invisibles). Bolland provided covers for three issues of Mark Millar's Swamp Thing run (1995), and miniseries including Vamps (1994‚Äì5), both Vertigo Tank Girl (1995‚Äì6) miniseries and Blood + Water (2003) as well as the one-shot Zatanna: Everyday Magic (2003). Bolland also wrote and illustrated stories for the anthology titles Heartthrobs and Strange Adventures (1999) and OGN 1001 Nights of Snowfall, as well as providing a cover each for the Gangland and Winter's Edge anthologies. With issue #12, Bolland took over cover duties (from Fables cover artist James Jean) on Fables spin-off Jack of Fables, which he continues to produce . Fabry, in addition to his Preacher covers, provided covers for Ennis' miniseries Adventures in the Rifle Brigade: Operation Bollock (2001‚Äì2) and mostIssues #52‚Äì83. Ennis' first run on the title was Hellblazer #41‚Äì83. of that authors first run on Hellblazer (1992‚Äì4) ‚Äî which included the first Vertigo issue ‚Äî as well as his return to the title in 1998‚Äì9. In addition, Fabry has also penciled a couple of short Hellblazer stories for various specials, and drew the covers for the Hellblazer: The Trenchcoat Brigade miniseries. He contributed to the multi-artist Transmetropolitan special \\"I Hate It Here\\" and provided three covers each to the ongoing Transmetropolitan (2002) and Swamp Thing (Vol. 3) (2001); covered the complete Scarab (1993‚Äì4) miniseries, all 19 issues of Outlaw Nation and one issue each of the anthology titles Gangland, Heartthrobs and Weird War Tales. Between 2005 and 2006, Fabry fully illustrated Mike Carey's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, having previously collaborated with the man himself on a story in the 2003 OGN Sandman: Endless Nights. At the start of 2008, he provided a cover for an issue of Exterminators, before taking over from Lee Bermejo as on-going cover artist on, again, Hellblazer. Other notable cover artists include Dan Brereton, Tim Bradstreet, Duncan Fegredo, James Jean, Dave Johnson and J. G. Jones.

It is part of the State College, Pennsylvania Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 9,660 at the 2010 census. History Park Forest Village, created in 1956, was the first large suburban development near State College. This neighborhood won several national awards for its design, which moved away from the straight streets and clear cutting typical of post World War II suburban developments. The use of gracefully curved streets and the retention of trees established a pattern for future developments everywhere. Geography Park Forest Village is located in southern Centre County at (40.801060, -77.909423). The eastern end of the community touches the northwest corner of the borough of State College. The northern edge of the community is defined by U.S. Route 322 Business (North Atherton Street). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. The subdivision was originally developed on of land known as part of the Barrens in Patton Township by J. Alvin Hawbaker, a well-known real estate developer in State College. Mr. Hawbaker's assistant designer was a noted architect/landscape architect Carl W. Wild, who insisted on focusing on street tree-plantings to define each street and maintaining as many naturally growing trees, as possible. Through their company, Park Forest Enterprises, they created the cul de sac and curved streets design of Park Forest Village which ended up yielding more housing units per square mile than the conventional city grid pattern. Park Forest Village also utilized several localized parks so that common recreation areas would be accessible to each neighborhood in the subdivision. The landscaping of each homesite also retained as many native trees on the original land as possible, giving each property abundant trees and a mature, long-term, lived in look as opposed to young sapling trees planted at the time most conventional homes were constructed that took years to grow and mature. As the building of the subdivision progressed, utility lines were buried so that telephone and power line poles became unnecessary, giving the streets a cleaner design and look. J. Alvin Hawbaker also pioneered the \\"Gallery of Homes\\" real estate marketing approach, which resulted in the sale of thousands of housing units within the area now known as Park Forest Village.

History Patton Township was established in 1794 and named after Colonel John Patton, a revolutionary officer, who co- owned the Centre Furnace, along with Colonel Samuel Miles. The Peter Gray family and the Conrad Hartsock family were the earliest settlers to the area. They came to the Half Moon Valley in 1788, from Frederick County, Maryland, and settled in what is now Patton Township. The early days were strongly influenced by Methodism. As soon as Peter Gray had a roof on his log cabin, he began Sunday School classes, and founded what is today Grays United Methodist Church. These settlers also made pilgrimages to church at Warriors Mark, a 12-mile distance, because that was the nearest regular preaching point in the valley. Iron mining was begun in the early days of Patton Township, affording supply of ore for Centre Furnace.

According to local tradition, a grove of pine trees separating two of the early mills along the run provided the rest of the name. John Patton Jr., son of Centre Furnace ironmaster Col. John Patton, laid out the town of Pattonville at the east end of Pine Grove Mills in 1815, and the entire village went by Pattonville for a time.Pomeroy's 1874 Atlas The post office, founded in 1809, was continually known as the Pine Grove Mills post office, however, and the town eventually reverted to the original name.

History Squire Clement Beckwith laid out the town in 1850 and named it to honor his daughter, Matilda. Why he chose to call it Port Matilda is not clear, but the name may have reflected his hope that the town would eventually be connected to the Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Branch of the Pennsylvania canal.

The company was based at Latrobe, Pennsylvania and founded by Fred McFeely, the grandfather of children's television personality Fred Rogers. The company was later owned by General Refractories, which closed the Port Matilda plant in 1959. Its primary product was silica fire brick made from ganister rock, using beehive kilns.

Cutting through it were paths made by Indians who traveled from Paxtang (present day Harrisburg) to present day New Castle, Delaware to trade with the Swedes and later, the English. The Great Minquas Path was one of these trails. In 1717, Sadsbury township was organized. It included all of present-day Sadsbury Township as well as Fallowfield, Highland, and Valley townships. In August 1728, several inhabitants petitioned the court to separate Sadsbury from Fallowfield because of the former's size. In November of that year, the township was subdivided into East and West Sadsbury, and in 1729, upon the division of Chester County into Lancaster and Chester counties, the line between the two divisions of the township was made to conform to the county line. During the mid 18th century more settlers arrived, drawn by the township's rich farming land. The Indian trails became horse tracks and later wagon tracks as farmers shipped their goods to market in Philadelphia, Newport, Delaware, and New Castle, Delaware. The old Provincial Highway as authorized by the government was laid out in 1730 and the Newport Road to the ore mines at Cornwall in Lebanon County, was laid out in 1796. The earliest organized religious group in the area were the Presbyterians, who in 1720 formed what is known today as the Upper Octorara Presbyterian Church. They were followed by the Quakers who in 1724 founded the Sadsbury Meeting House. A year later, the English settlers formed St. John's Church. Andrew Moore (1688‚Äì1753), who had been influential with Samuel Miller in founding Sadsbury Meeting House, built a tub mill on his property. The original settlement in the town's current location was known as Penningtonville, and a post office by that name was established there in 1842. However, by the 1870s, the name Atglen was in common usage. In 1876, the court in West Chester made an official decree incorporating the village of Penningtonville as the \\"Borough of Atglen.\\"http://www.atglen.org/index.php/about-atglen/history Geography Atglen is located at (39.948106, -75.973887).

The population was 13,100 at the 2010 census. Coatesville is approximately 39 miles west of Philadelphia. It developed along Lancaster Turnpike, beginning in the late 18th century. It spans U.S. Route 30, the \\"Main Line\\" highway that runs west of Philadelphia. Coatesville developed in the early 20th century with the growth of the Lukens Steel Company and other industry. Its population declined after industrial restructuring, which reduced these jobs. Lukens was bought by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1997. In 2002, Bethlehem was bought by the then Ohio-based International Steel Group (ISG). Later, Mittal Steel bought ISG and merged with Arcelor Steel to form the ArcelorMittal company. History=Beginnings Varying cultures of Native Americans lived in this area. The first known settlement in the area which would be known as Coatesville was a historic Lenape village built along the West Branch of the Brandywine River. This settlement was a post for fur trading with the earliest American settlers. The Brandywine River has featured prominently in the history of Coatesville. William Fleming, originally from Scotland, is one of the earliest landowners on record. He built a log cabin in the area of Harmony Street and 5th Avenue and owned about of land bordering the Brandywine River.Mowday, Bruce Edward. Images of America: Coatesville; Charleston, South Carolina; Arcadia Press; 2003; pp 7-8. . Moses Coates, a prosperous farmer and the namesake of Coatesville, bought the cabin from Fleming's son in 1787. With the economy rising in the years after the United States gained independence, Moses Coates' son-in-law, Jesse Kersey, came up with a plan to develop the area by selling frontage on the recently completed Lancaster Turnpike which crossed through their land. The Lancaster Turnpike was the first toll road in the U.S., authorized in 1792 and completed in 1795. A tollgate was located within the present-day Coatesville city limits. Because Coatesville was located roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Lancaster on the turnpike, it became a popular stopping place. Pierre Bizallion, a French fur trader, settled in the area in the early 18th century. He was said to serve as an interpreter between William Penn and Native American peoples.Chester Co PA; Caln; 1881 HISTORY The Veterans Administration Hospital now occupies a large piece of the roughly of land that was once owned by Bizallion. 19th century Before Coatesville became a city, the only one in Chester County, it was called Bridge-Town, after the two bridges crossing the Brandywine River. A village named \\"Midway\\", named after its station owned by the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad midway between Philadelphia and Lancaster, was formed in 1834 on the western bank of the Brandywine. The village of Midway and the village of Bridge-Town merged in 1867 to become the borough of Coatesville. Coatesville citizens voted to become a city in 1915. Coatesville exploited the natural energy of the Brandywine River. Jesse Kersey, Moses Coates' son-in-law, partnered with the ironmaster Isaac Pennock and purchased over of Moses Coates' farm along both sides of the Brandywine River in 1810. They formed the Brandywine Iron Works and Nail Factory, the forerunner of Lukens Steel. Charles Lukens, MD, married Isaac Pennock's daughter Rebecca in 1813. Following her husband's death in 1825, Rebecca Lukens took over the operations of the mill, purchasing it from her mother. She directed operations through a period of turmoil and market panic, developing it into a prosperous mill. Rebecca Lukens was one of the first women to operate a major corporation in the United States.\\"Rebecca Lukens\\" , National Steel Heritage Museum 20th century Main Office of Lukens Steel As Lukens Steel grew so did Coatesville, eventually becoming known as the \\"Pittsburgh of the East.\\" By the beginning of the 20th century the population had grown to 6,000, attracting immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe to its industrial jobs, as well as both black and white migrants from the rural South. Tensions rose in the city as the population rapidly became more diverse. In August 1911, steelworker Zachariah Walker was lynched in Coatesville; he had left his wife and children in Virginia while seeking better work. This African-American man was accused of killing Deputy Constable/Coal and Iron Policeman Edgar Rice, a popular figure in town. Walker claimed self-defense and was hospitalized after his arrest. He was dragged from the hospital and burned to death in front of a mob of hundreds in a field south of the city. Fifteen men and teenage boys were indicted, but all were acquitted at trials. The lynching was the last in Pennsylvania and is said to have left a permanent stain on the city's image.Eric S. Smith, \\"Zachariah Walker's lynching haunts the city\\", Daily Local News (Chester County), 13 August 2011, accessed 5 January 2016 Walker's murder was investigated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which called for an end to lynching nationwide. Pennsylvania passed a state anti-lynching law in 1923. But, even after passage of an anti-lynching House bill in the 1920s, no federal law was passed because of the power of the Democratic southern block in the Senate. It represented only white southerners; African Americans had been disfranchised in the South since the turn of the century. Racial violence was spreading all across America during the Red Summer of 1919 and the local African-American community was on edge. On July 8, 1919, the black community of Coatesville formed a large armed protection group to prevent the rumoured lynching of a rape suspect. Only later when the armed group had surrounded the jail to prevent the attack did they learn that there was no suspect and no lynch mob. The school system expanded to keep up and the religious community became more diverse, with Roman Catholic churches founded and Beth Israel Congregation, one of Chester County's few synagogues. In 1932 there were a total of 22 churches of various denominations in the city. After World War II the steel industry began a long decline, but in the 1960s Lukens Steel was still the largest employer in Chester County, with over 10,000 workers. It finally started to restructure due to industry changes, was sold several times, and its workers were reduced in number to 5,000 and eventually to 2,000. 21st century Episcopal Church of the Trinity, 323 East Lincoln Highway Since the turn of the century, Coatesville has invested in redevelopment, encouraging private projects. It has torn down public housing and encouraged new single family and townhouse developments. A new Marriott Courtyard hotel, built along Route 82 on the outskirts of Coatesville, opened in May 2012. The city has major opportunity to redefine itself as 4 out of 5 of its census tracts are eligible to receive several federal and state economic development grants for economic redevelopment and population health. As of January 2017, city leadership has yet to produce the required action plans to appropriately seize these opportunities. The latest activity involves hedging all economic development on the downtown area only, partnering with Wells Fargo amongst others without an effort to complete a population health plan for the city first, a formula for gentrification. A lack of consensus actions has plagued the city throughout the new millennium and is the reason for a cycle of starts and stops, the most popular involving an eminent domain dispute regarding the attempted creation of a city owned golf course. See Coatesville Growing Greater www.coatesvillegrowinggreater.org The redevelopment plans have generated controversy.Authority, council seek to close rift - dailylocal.com The city was involved in a 5-year eminent domain dispute with a local landowner in neighboring Valley Township. It was resolved without the need to seize the property, but displeasure with the events resulted in the city voters turning out four incumbent city councilpersons in the November 2005 general elections. Two of the four new councilpersons are ordained Pentecostal and Methodist ministers, respectively. The city council fired the city solicitor, and accepted the resignation of the city manager (who had negotiated with the Valley Township landowner). The assistant manager, police chief, and city treasurer also resigned. A series of arsons took place in the city from 2007 to early 2009. A December 2008 fire at a Strode Avenue home resulted in the death of Irene Kempest, an 83-year-old World War II Holocaust survivor. A fire the following month on the 300 block of Fleetwood Street burned 17 row houses, causing $2 million in damage and leaving dozens of people homeless. By March 2009, police had arrested six suspects in the fires. A total of nearly 70 fires occurred during this period. On June 8, 2010 one man, pleading no-contest due to mental illness, was sentenced to a 60-year prison sentence for five of the fires, one of which resulted in Kempest's death. Another man pleaded guilty to the Fleetwood Street fire and eight others, receiving a sentence of 12.5 to 25 years with an order to pay $2.5 million in restitution. Twenty of the nearly 70 fires over the two-year span remain unsolved. In 1969 Lukens Steel forged steel beams for the World Trade Center to be constructed in New York City. Some of these beams, known as \\"trees\\", remained standing after the 9/11 Terrorist Attacks. Ten of the \\"trees\\" that remained were transported to Coatesville on April 15, 2010. They are to be used as a part of the proposed National Iron and Steel Heritage Museum. The Coatesville Historic District, Clement Atkinson Memorial Hospital, High Bridge, Abram Huston House and Carriage House, Lukens Historic District, Lukens Main Office Building, National Bank of Coatesville Building, and Terracina are resources listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 7,891. Downingtown was settled by English and European colonists in the early 18th century and has a number of historic buildings and structures. History Keystone Marker The town was originally named Milltown due to its number of mills along the East Branch Brandywine Creek, the first of which was founded by Daniel Butter. The Butter family also had paper mills in the area, and Frederick Bicking from Winterburg, Germany, was the patriarch of the Bicking paper families. Around the time of the American Revolution, Milltown became more commonly known as Downingtown after the prominent businessman Thomas Downing, a Quaker immigrant in 1717 from Bradninch, Devon, England, who owned a number of those mills. The town was officially named Downingtown in 1812. The town is located along the Lincoln Highway (now part of U.S. Route 30) which runs from the East Coast to the West Coast. It was an early westward road in the wagon days as the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike. The Lincoln Highway was the first paved road to cross the nation from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike started in the early 1940s and was completed in the early 1950s; it runs north of US 30, bypassing Downingtown. Downingtown Log House About 1705 Sami Warren built what has become known as the Downingtown Log House. In 1713 the next owner Hickman sold the 1¬Ω story, 21' 9\\"√ó25' structure to Thomas and Mary Moore. Thomas Moore moved from the Log House in 1729 and died in 1738. Thomas Downing acquired the Log House in 1739. It remained in the Downing family until 1940, when Thomas W. Downing died and left it to the borough of Downingtown. The borough did some restoration work to the Downingtown Log House in 1947. It served as the home to the Downingtown Chamber of Commerce from 1950 until 1988. But the Log House was deteriorating as Route 30 had been built close to it. Located below street level, the house suffered water damage due to runoff from Route 30 and vibration from traffic weakened the structure. From 1988 until 1990 the Downingtown Historical Society relocated the house and did an extensive restoration with money raised for the project. It now sits approximately west of its original location, from the Route 30 sidewalk, and slightly above street level.\\"Log House\\" , Downington Historical Society In 1904 John S. Trower and William A. Creditt, prominent black Philadelphians, founded the Downingtown Industrial and Agricultural School (DIAS) in Downingtown, to serve as an academic and vocational high school for African-American youths to prepare them for work. Creditt was pastor of the First African Baptist Church in Philadelphia, and Trower, a successful caterer and one of the wealthiest black businessmen in the nation,\\"John S.

An extranet is similar to a DMZ in that it provides access to needed services for authorized parties, without granting access to an organization's entire network. Historically, the term was occasionally also used in the sense of two organizations sharing their internal networks over a virtual private network (VPN). See Enterprise applications During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several industries started to use the term 'extranet' to describe centralized repositories of shared data (and supporting applications) made accessible via the web only to authorized members of particular work groups - for example, geographically dispersed, multi-company project teams. Some applications are offered on a software as a service (SaaS) basis. For example, in the construction industry, project teams may access a project extranet to share drawings, photographs and documents, and use online applications to mark-up and make comments and to manage and report on project-related communications. In 2003 in the United Kingdom, several of the leading vendors formed the Network for Construction Collaboration Technology Providers (NCCTP) to promote the technologies and to establish data exchange standards between the different data systems. The same type of construction-focused technologies have also been developed in the United States, Australia and mainland Europe.

The population was 18,026 at the 2010 census.  History  The ten square miles of land that is now the township of East Goshen was part of a larger tract purchased from William Penn in Wales in September 1681. Settlers, finding the land beautiful and productive, named the area Goshenville, or \\"the Land of Goshen.\\" The blacksmith shop located on North Chester Road was built in 1699. It was here in the early years that wagon wheels were rerimmed, farm implements repaired, and horses shod. As part of East Goshen's tricentennial in 1982, the blacksmith shop was renovated and restored. East Goshen Township was incorporated in 1817 when Goshen was divided, forming East and West Goshen townships. The Goshenville Historic District, Goodwin Acres, and Ellis Williams House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Resources  East Goshen Township owns a park located on Paoli Pike. Facilities at the park include the Hicks Pavilion with a brick barbecue. There are areas in the park for sports such as baseball, softball, and soccer fields, four sand volleyball courts, six tennis courts with wind screens and hitting backboard, two full-size basketball courts with additional baskets for shooting around, a equipped fitness trail, a children's activity area, a putting green, and a gazebo. The park has many passive areas for sunbathing, reading, frisbee throwing, etc. The park is also a popular place for walkers and joggers. It has restroom facilities and water fountains. Parking space has been enhanced and all facilities are planned and installed with the idea of maintaining a harmony with nature. The park closes at dusk and drinking alcohol is prohibited. The park was named \\"The Best Family Park\\" by Best of the Main Line, a magazine that rates the best places and food in the Philadelphia Main Line area. As of 2016, The Board of Supervisors approved application to the Chesco Municipal Grant Program for a Paoli Pike Trail. The 2.7-mile trail would connect East High School with the ‚ÄúTown Center‚Äù between Boot Road and North Chester Road and then the entire network of trails in the Township Park and Applebrook Park.

Points of interest Nantmeal was named by Welsh immigrants from the village of Nantmel in Radnorshire, now part of Powys. The Welsh name, Nantmel, means 'the valley of Mael', a tenth-century prince. The incorrect belief that it means 'Honey Brook' is based on a confusion between the personal name 'Mael', and the Welsh word 'm√™l', 'honey'. The Thomas Bull House was built sometime between 1783 and 1796; Bull was a stonemason and the manager of Warwick Furnace; he served as a lieutenant colonel in the Revolutionary War. Reading Furnace Historic District straddles French Creek, which forms part of the boundary between East Nantmeal and Warwick townships. The site began as an iron furnace in 1736 and later owned by Samuel Van Leer and his family. It was developed as a farm in the early 19th century, and was then remodeled as a country estate for Arthur Pew in 1936. The remodeled mansion (1812) was designed by architect R. Brognard Okie. Warwick Furnace Farms forms a significant part of the history of the early iron industry and of the families Nutt, Rutter, Savage, Van Leer and Potts. Welkinweir (the Grace and Everett Rodebaugh Estate) is a preserve encompassing three buildings, gardens, ponds, natural wildlife habitat, trails, wetlands and woods. Grace and Everett Rodebaugh purchased the aging farm in 1935 as a weekend retreat and summer home. They retained architect Fridtjof Tobiessen to \\"make the mansion livable.\\" This may be the only significant residential commission of Tobiessen, whose principal works were public schools, memorials, and churches. Brower's Bridge, Thomas Bull House, Warwick Furnace Farms, and Welkinweir are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It was eventually sold by Pike's descendants and in 1838 was split in two parts, East Pikeland and West Pikeland.East Pikeland Township History, accessed January 4, 2008 Mr. E. Kimber established the French Creek Boarding School for Girls in the 1830s and gave his name to the Village of Kimberton. East Pikeland today retains over 150 historically significant structures and sites. Those located in the historic Kimberton Village are the Kimberton Inn, the girls' school, Chrisman's Mill (now the Kimberton Post Office), the Kimberton Train Station and Pennypackers Mill. The Zion Lutheran Church on Route 724 holds the distinction of being the second oldest Lutheran Church in the United States; and the Rapps Dam Covered Bridge and the Silver Bridge iron bridge on Hares Hill Road both have historic significance. East Pikeland was directly involved in the Revolutionary War, especially from 1775 through 1778, and most heavily during the \\"Philadelphia Campaign\\" in 1777 and 1778. It was a source of provisions for the Army from its farms, mills and cottage industries. Military importance came in 1775 with the authorization by the Committee of Safety in Philadelphia from the Continental Powder Mill, and the site chosen was at Rapps Dam on French Creek. The mill was a key element in a system of munitions supply that involved the Warwick and Reading iron furnaces near the headwaters of French Creek, which together with other furnaces such as Hopewell produced cannon and ammunition for Washington. The prime location of the mill on the creek with its long millrace was not forgotten after the war. Some of the mill buildings were reconstructed and over the next 150 years, continued to operate variously as oil, saw, grist and spoke mills. East Pikeland Township has seen considerable change since the early part of the 20th century. The area around Kimberton saw expanded housing areas, as did the corridors near Routes 23 & 724\\\\. Only the main roads were paved, according to a 1938 map. The reason for the growth in the township over the years has been an influx of population that has found East Pikeland Township an attractive and practical place to live. The suburbanization of the township, as most areas, occurred as the availability of automobiles made the general population mobile. In 1940, the township population was 976. Space to house the ever-increasing population came from the conversion of lands that had traditionally been dairy or wheat farms. Although some farms remain today, the predominant land use pattern in the central portion of the township is residential. The spread of suburban development has occurred primarily in the French Creek valley, along Cold Stream Road. Also occurring since World War II has been the development of townhouse complexes, shopping centers and industrial sites, such as the Cromby Power Station (PECO) and shopping centers along Routes 23 & 724\\\\. The closing of the remaining one and two room school houses occurred in the 1950s, in favor of the regional school system.

The township is partially located in the Hopewell Big Woods. History In 1686, Dr. Daniel Coxe received a land patent from William Penn. Major Robert Thompson and he owned what is now East and West Vincent. In 1733, the German Reformed Congregation of Vincent Township was formed. Two years later, in 1735, the Vincent Mennonite Meeting was formed. In that same year, Garrett Brumbaugh established a tavern on Ridge Road. Nicholas Kaiser soon opened a grist mill near the mouth of Pigeon Creek in 1737, and so began the formation of East Vincent. However, nine years later in 1746, all lands in Vincent were leased and were not available for sale, because of a land dispute. There were 46 renters. In 1754, another tavern opened along Ridge Road, courtesy of Michael Cyfer. Today, the tavern is the reportedly haunted restaurant Seven Stars Inn. Four years later, the German Reformation Congregation constructed a log church, which was dedicated May 27. John Phillips Leydich served as the first pastor of the facility. Today, the ground is site to the East Vincent United Church of Christ. Around 1760, John Young built a house on Cooks Glen Road, which still stands today, and is known for being one of the oldest houses in the area. The 1760s brought about a boom of development to the area, with Peter Stager and Edward Parker opening up establishments. The former built the Benjamin Custard Inn on Schuylkill Road. Today, it is the White Hall Inn. The latter's was a tavern near a ford on the Schuylkill River. They both opened in 1768. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington and his troops forded the Schuylkill River behind the Parker Tavern. Between 1786 and 1790, a 100-year-long dispute was settled in the courts, allowing property to finally be sold. By this time, 90 renters and a total population of 430 existed. In 1800, Frederick Sheeder moved to East Vincent. A year later, Henry Parker built a house opposite the tavern that bore his name. In 1821, a tragedy struck East Vincent when the German Reformed Church split because of temperance caused by revival meetings. Just that year, John C. Guldin had become the fifth pastor of the church. Between 1823 and 1824, the township gained morale, as the Schuylkill Navigation Company built dams, lakes, and canals to carry water between Pottsville and Philadelphia, decreasing hardship in Vincent. In 1831, a wall was built along the Revolutionary War Soldiers' Cemetery by the Union Battalion of Volunteers of Chester County, dedicated to the brave men who gave their lives to help shape the nation. In 1832, joyfulness became clear as the battle was won: East and West Vincent were divided along the French Creek.

History Founded in 1704, Whiteland Township was made up of what is today known as East and West Whiteland townships. The first European settlers were Welsh. The name Whiteland came from Whitford Garden in Flintshire, Wales. Whiteland Township was divided into two townships in 1765. Native Americans called the area \\"The Dark Valley\\" because of the numerous trees and undergrowth. During the American Revolution, Gen. George Washington and many of his troops camped at Malin Hall here. They were preparing for a September 16, 1777, encounter with British General William Howe. The Continental Army also camped near White Horse Inn on Swedesford Road. Because of bad weather, however, the \\"Battle of the Clouds\\" was never fought.

The population was 10,477 at the 2010 census. History The land that eventually became Easttown Township was once part of the Welsh Tract, a large expanse of land promised by William Penn to a group of Welsh Quaker settlers in which they would be able to speak and conduct business in the Welsh language. While the autonomous entity envisioned by some was never formed, it left its mark in the many Welsh place names that still exist, such as the Berwyn, in Easttown, and nearby Tredyffrin Township. The township is believed to have been incorporated in 1704, as that is the earliest date it has been found to be referred to in official records. While the originators of the Welsh Tract were Quakers, the earliest settlers in the portion that became Easttown Township were mostly Anglicans. St. David's Episcopal Church, just past the eastern edge of the township, was constructed in 1715 by Welsh Anglicans when the original church sent them a minister.

The name of the British commander, Banastre Tarleton, was later given to a nearby mansion: Tarleton. Two sites in the township are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Waynesborough and Roughwood. The cluster of buildings that forms the village of Leopard, identified as a \\"Significant Historic Cluster\\" in the Chester County Historic Sites Survey (1979‚Äì1982), is eligible for listing as well. In addition, the Waterloo Mills Historic District has been designated. Although St. David's Church is just over the line in Newtown Township, the church building and its graveyard (most of which is in Easttown) are listed together in the National Register. Easttown Township is said to have the most-litigated zoning law in Pennsylvania, largely as a result of its efforts to avoid being swallowed up by the expansion of the suburbs of Philadelphia. At least two major cases about minimum lot size were handed down by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court: Bilbar ConstructionBilbar Construction Co. v. Easttown Twp., 393 Pa. 62, 141 A.2d 851 (1958). upheld the township's minimum lot sizes, while National Land and Investment Co.National Land and Investment Co. v. Easttown Twp. Bd. of Adjustment, 419 Pa. 504, 215 A.2d 597 (1965). struck them down as \\"exclusionary\\" seven years later. National Land further held that a municipality may utilize zoning measures that are substantially related to the protection and preservation of the municipality's proper interest in providing for the general welfare of its residents, but Easttown's zoning did not pass the test. Ironically, despite the developer- litigants' claimed interest in allowing poor people to live in Easttown, they only built houses that sold at well over the average value in Pennsylvania.

The population was 1,225 at the 2010 census. Settled near the region's early iron mines, Elverson is close to Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site, an example of a 19th-century \\"iron plantation\\". History Elverson's earliest settlers arrived in the late 18th century when the area was known as Springfield. Later dubbed Blue Rock after a deposit of peculiar rocks not far from the town, it remained largely rural until the arrival of the Wilmington and Northern Railroad in 1870. By 1883, the town's population had more than doubled. In 1899, the settlement was named Elverson after James Elverson, owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer, who would later donate a stained glass window to a church there. The Borough of Elverson was officially incorporated on April 17, 1911, from land annexed from West Nantmeal Township, and it remained the commercial center of northwestern Chester County through the first half of the 20th century. In 1953 the borough annexed additional land, resulting in its current size of about one square mile. Elverson's building styles follow the periods of its commercial growth and range from early 19th century stone or log buildings to post-railroad Queen Anne structures and 20th century craftsman and Foursquare-style houses. Commercial and residential development since the 1950s has occurred largely on the outskirts of the borough's historic center. The Wilmington and Northern Railroad line, later incorporated into the Reading Railroad system, was abandoned and removed in 1983. The Elverson Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. Elverson borders the Hopewell Big Woods.

Its population was 4.9k at the 2010 census. The Exton Square Mall and Main Street at Exton are both located within Exton along with several other shopping centers, making Exton the major shopping district in Chester County. History Exton lies at the intersection of U.S. Route 30 (formerly the Lancaster Road, and later the Lincoln Highway) and Pennsylvania Route 100 (Pottstown Pike). Beginning in the late 18th century, the Lancaster Road became a major transportation route between Philadelphia and the west, while what is now Route 100 was a regional north-south route to Pottstown. A theory exists that Exton was named as the \\"X\\" on the map, denoting this intersection, though more likely the village was named after one of the several Extons in the United Kingdom. In the late 1940s, Exton became home to the Newcomen Society of the United States. The campus of the learned society was built overlooking farmland on Newcomen Road, and featured offices, a printing shop, library and museum, guest houses, a chapel and a belltower with a carillon. The Newcomen Society (since dissolved) sold the property in the late 1990s, but its campus remains an Exton landmark serving as the headquarters of another business.

The population of the borough was 1,713 at the 2010 census. The borough is surrounded by Honey Brook Township, and both are referred to locally collectively as Honey Brook. History Honey Brook Township was divided from Nantmeal Township in 1789. A schoolmaster and land developer named Stinson bought a plot of land along Horseshoe Pike in 1815. He had it surveyed and held a lottery to sell the lots for the town he called Waynesborough in honor of the Revolutionary War general Mad Anthony Wayne. The residents changed the name to Honey Brook in 1884. Honey Brook is an incorrect English translation of Nantmel, a village in Radnorshire, now part of Powys. The Welsh name actually means 'Ma√´l's valley', Ma√´l being a tenth-century prince. Honey Brook was incorporated as a borough in 1891. In 1884 the railroad from Philadelphia- Downingtown-Lancaster was completed and ran along the south side of Horseshoe Pike. The railroad caused a problem for the village: there was another Waynesburg in western Pennsylvania. The freight was being routed to the wrong stations, so the name was changed from Waynesburg to Honey Brook. As the town grew, a petition was circulated in 1891 for the town to be incorporated into a borough. Almost every homeowner signed. With the incorporation as a borough, the main problems to overcome were: street lighting, sidewalks, and, several years later, water. The borough accepted public water in September 1896. Electric streetlights were installed after much discussion in 1915. Before that, gas lamps were used to light the streets. Over the years, boardwalks were replaced by bricks, then by concrete sidewalks. There are still two brick sidewalks in the borough. Horseshoe Pike, formerly Main Street, has the only fully paved sidewalks in the borough. When the borough was incorporated, the census was around 600. As of the census in 2000, the population had doubled. The oldest organization in Honey Brook Borough is Honey Brook United Methodist Church. The longest continuous business is W.L. White‚Äôs & Sons.

It is west of Philadelphia. The population was 2,998 at the 2010 census. The borough is bordered by Paoli Pike on the south, Sugartown Road on the west, Willistown Township on the east, and East Whiteland Township on the north. It is south of US 30 and easily accessible to Route 202. The main road through the Borough is King Street, intersected by Warren Avenue. The Malvern ZIP code covers Malvern, and all or parts of East Whiteland, Charlestown, Willistown, East Goshen, East Pikeland, and Tredyffrin Townships. Malvern Borough is between Paoli on the east, and Immaculata University and Exton on the west. It is also a train stop on the SEPTA Paoli/Thorndale Line. Geography Downtown area Malvern is located at (40.034557, -75.514396). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. History The area was originally settled by Welsh immigrants in the 17th century who bought land from William Penn. Malvern is the site of the Paoli Massacre, which occurred September 20, 1777, during the American Revolutionary War under the command of General Anthony Wayne of nearby Easttown. In 1835, the East Whiteland Baptist Church moved to what is now its church and cemetery property, bounded by Channing, South Warren, and East First Avenues, and Roberts Lane. Changing its name to the Willistown Baptist Church, this institution then became the First Baptist Church of Malvern in 1900. The church, trains, and a few businesses were the nucleus of this village, which was known for a long period as West Chester Intersection due to its position at the junction of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad and the West Chester Railroad. In 1873, the community‚Äôs name was changed to Malvern when the Philadelphia and Columbia's successor, the Pennsylvania Railroad, straightened its tracks through the village. In 1879, the Malvern Friends Meeting was built at the northwest corner of Woodland Avenue and Roberts Lane, followed by the arrival of the Presbyterians and the Methodists prior to 1900.A Century in Malvern, Malvern Historical Commission, 1989 The village's status as a railroad junction came to an end in March 1880 when the West Chester Railroad's northern terminal was moved west to Frazer, Pennsylvania.Moore, p. 23. Malvern Borough has a mix of residential styles and neighborhoods, retail and industrial businesses, dedicated open land, and numerous civic, cultural, and religious organizations. Malvern was incorporated August 13, 1889, having separated from the northern portion of Willistown Township. On April 22, 2008, the Borough converted to a Home Rule form of government. In addition to the Paoli Battlefield Site and Parade Grounds, the Wharton Esherick Studio was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Name The eastern part of Malvern No official origin to the naming of the Borough of Malvern remains, although several theories abound. The most common suggestions are Malvern Hills in Worcestershire, Great Britain and Malvern Hill in Virginia. As the Malvern in Pennsylvania is itself raised above the surrounding communities, it is possible either location in Britain or Virginia could have been the influence, but the truth is lost to history. Given that the original settlers were Welsh, Malvern is more likely named after the British location.

It defined the administrative and religious city center, as distinct from the rest of the city. It can also signify a body of citizens. In modern historiography, polis is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, such as Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as \\"city-state\\". These cities consisted of a fortified city centre (asty) built on an acropolis or harbour and controlled surrounding territories of land (kh√¥ra). The Ancient Greek city-state developed during the Archaic period as the ancestor of city, state, and citizenship and persisted (though with decreasing influence) well into Roman times, when the equivalent Latin word was civitas, also meaning \\"citizenhood\\", while municipium applied to a non-sovereign local entity. The term \\"city-state\\", which originated in English (alongside the German Stadtstaat), does not fully translate the Greek term. The poleis were not like other primordial ancient city-states like Tyre or Sidon, which were ruled by a king or a small oligarchy, but rather political entities ruled by their bodies of citizens. The traditional view of archaeologists‚Äîthat the appearance of urbanization at excavation sites could be read as a sufficient index for the development of a polis‚Äîwas criticised by Fran√ßois Polignac in 1984. and has not been taken for granted in recent decades: the polis of Sparta, for example, was established in a network of villages. The term polis, which in archaic Greece meant \\"city\\", changed with the development of the governance center in the city to signify \\"state\\" (which included its surrounding villages). Finally, with the emergence of a notion of citizenship among landowners, it came to describe the entire body of citizens. The ancient Greeks did not always refer to Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and other poleis as such; they often spoke instead of the Athenians, Lacedaemonians, Thebans and so on. The body of citizens came to be the most important meaning of the term polis in ancient Greece. The Greek term that specifically meant the totality of urban buildings and spaces is asty ().  The polis in Ancient Greek philosophy  Plato analyzes the polis in The Republic, whose Greek title, Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒµŒØŒ± (Politeia), itself derives from the word polis. The best form of government of the polis for Plato is the one that leads to the common good. The philosopher king is the best ruler because, as a philosopher, he is acquainted with the Form of the Good. In Plato's analogy of the ship of state, the philosopher king steers the polis, as if it were a ship, in the best direction. Books II‚ÄìIV of The Republic are concerned with Plato addressing the makeup of an ideal polis. In The Republic, Socrates is concerned with the two underlying principles of any society: mutual needs and differences in aptitude. Starting from these two principles, Socrates deals with the economic structure of an ideal polis. According to Plato, there are five main economic classes of any polis: producers, merchants, sailors/shipowners, retail traders, and wage earners. Along with the two principles and five economic classes, there are four virtues. The four virtues of a \\"just city\\" include wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. With all of these principles, classes, and virtues, it was believed that a \\"just city\\" (polis) would exist. Archaic and classical poleis The basic and indicating elements of a polis are: * Self-governance, autonomy, and independence (city-state) * Agora: the social hub and financial marketplace, on and around a centrally located, large open space * Acropolis: the citadel, inside which a temple had replaced the erstwhile Mycenaean an√°ktoron (palace) or m√©garon (hall) * Greek urban planning and architecture, public, religious, and private (see Hippodamian plan) * Temples, altars, and sacred precincts: one or more are dedicated to the poliouchos, the patron deity of the city; each polis kept its own particular festivals and customs (Political religion, as opposed to the individualized religion of later antiquity). Priests and priestesses, although often drawn from certain families by tradition, did not form a separate collegiality or class; they were ordinary citizens who on certain occasions were called to perform certain functions. * Gymnasia * Theatres * Walls: used for protection from invaders * Coins: minted by the city, and bearing its symbols * Colonies being founded by the oikistes of the metropolis * Political life: it revolved around the sovereign Ekklesia (the assembly of all adult male citizens for deliberation and voting), the standing boule and other civic or judicial councils, the archons and other officials or magistrates elected either by vote or by lot, clubs, etc., and sometimes punctuated by stasis (civil strife between parties, factions or socioeconomic classes, e.g., aristocrats, oligarchs, democrats, tyrants, the wealthy, the poor, large, or small landowners, etc.). They practised direct democracy. * Publication of state functions: laws, decrees, and major fiscal accounts were published, and criminal and civil trials were also held in public. * Synoecism, conurbation: Absorption of nearby villages and countryside, and the incorporation of their tribes into the substructure of the polis. Many of a polis' citizens lived in the suburbs or countryside. The Greeks regarded the polis less as a territorial grouping than as a religious and political association: while the polis would control territory and colonies beyond the city itself, the polis would not simply consist of a geographical area. Most cities were composed of several tribes or phylai, which were in turn composed of phratries (common- ancestry lineages), and finally 'g√©nea' (extended families). * Social classes and citizenship: Dwellers of the polis were generally divided into four types of inhabitants, with status typically determined by birth: ** Citizens with full legal and political rights: that is, free adult men born legitimately of citizen parents. They had the right to vote, be elected into office, and bear arms, and the obligation to serve when at war. ** Citizens without formal political rights but with full legal rights: the citizens' female relatives and underage children, whose political rights and interests were meant to be represented by their adult male relatives. ** Citizens of other poleis who chose to reside elsewhere (the metics, ŒºŒ≠œÑŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøŒπ, m√©toikoi, literally \\"transdwellers\\"): though free-born and possessing full rights in their place of origin, they had full legal rights but no political rights in their place of residence. Metics could not vote or be elected to office. A liberated slave was likewise given a metic's status if he chose to remain in the polis, at least that was the case in Athens. They otherwise had full personal and property rights, albeit subject to taxation. ** Slaves: chattel in full possession of their owner, and with no privileges other than those that their owner would grant (or revoke) at will. Hellenistic and Roman During the Hellenistic period, which marks the decline of the classical polis, the following cities remained independent: Sparta until 195 BC after the War against Nabis. Achaean League is the last example of original Greek city-state federations (dissolved after the Battle of Corinth (146 BC)). The Cretan city- states continued to be independent (except Itanus and Arsinoe, which lay under Ptolemaic influence) until the conquest of Crete in 69 BC by Rome. The cities of Magna Graecia, with the notable examples of Syracuse and Tarentum, were conquered by Rome in the late 3rd century BC. There are also some cities with recurring independence like Samos, Priene, Miletus, and Athens.. A remarkable example of a city-state that flourished during this era is Rhodes, through its merchant navy,. until 43 BC and the Roman conquest. The Hellenistic colonies and cities of the era retain some basic characteristics of a polis, except the status of independence (city-state) and the political life. There is self- governance (like the new Macedonian title politarch), but under a ruler and king. The political life of the classical era was transformed into an individualized religious and philosophical view of life (see Hellenistic philosophy and religion). Demographic decline forced the cities to abolish the status of metic and bestow citizenship; in 228 BC, Miletus enfranchised over 1,000 Cretans.. Dyme sold its citizenship for one talent, payable in two installments. The foreign residents in a city are now called paroikoi. In an age when most political establishments in Asia are kingdoms, the Chrysaorian League in Caria was a Hellenistic federation of poleis. During the Roman era, some cities were granted the status of a polis, or free city, self-governed under the Roman Empire.. The last institution commemorating the old Greek poleis was the Panhellenion, established by Hadrian. Derived words Derivatives of polis are common in many modern European languages. This is indicative of the influence of the polis-centred Hellenic world view. Derivative words in English include policy, polity, police, and politics. In Greek, words deriving from polis include politƒìs and politismos, whose exact equivalents in Latin, Romance, and other European languages, respectively civis (\\"citizen\\"), civilisatio (\\"civilisation\\"), etc., are similarly derived. A number of words end in -polis. Most refer to a special kind of city or state. Examples include: * Astropolis ‚Äì a star-scaled city/industry area; a complex space station; a European star-related festival * Cosmopolis ‚Äì a large urban centre with a population of many different cultural backgrounds; a novel written by Don DeLillo * Ecumenopolis ‚Äì a city that covers an entire planet, usually seen in science fiction * Megalopolis ‚Äì created by the merging of several cities and their suburbs * Metropolis ‚Äì the mother city of a colony; the see of a metropolitan archbishop; a metropolitan area (major urban population centre) * Necropolis (\\"city of the dead\\") ‚Äì a graveyard * Technopolis ‚Äì a city with high-tech industry; a room of computers; the Internet Others refer to part of a city or a group of cities, such as: * Acropolis (\\"high city\\") ‚Äì the upper part of a polis, often a citadel or the site of major temples * Decapolis ‚Äì a group of ten cities * Dodecapolis ‚Äì a group of twelve cities * Pentapolis ‚Äì a group of five cities * Tripolis ‚Äì a group of three cities, retained in the names of Tripoli in Libya, in Greece, and a namesake in Lebanon  Names Polis, Cyprus= Located on the northwest coast of Cyprus is the town of Polis, or Polis Chrysochous (), situated within the Paphos District and on the edge of the Akamas peninsula. During the Cypro-Classical period, Polis became one of the most important ancient Cypriot city-kingdoms on the island, with important commercial relations with the eastern Aegean Islands, Attica, and Corinth. The town is also well known due to its mythological history, including the site of the Baths of Aphrodite. =Other cities= The names of several other towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East have contained the suffix -polis since antiquity or currently feature modernized spellings, such as -pol. Notable examples include: * Acropolis (\\"high city\\"), Athens, Greece ‚Äì although not a city-polis by itself, but a fortified citadel that consisted of functional buildings and the Temple in honor of the city-sponsoring god or goddess.

Oxford is the closest town to Lincoln University. The population was 5,077 at the 2010 census. History The borough was once called Oxford Crossing and Oxford Village during the 1700s. Oxford is located near the half-way point on the main road from Philadelphia to Baltimore. The owner of the stage between the two cities purchased Hood's Tavern and renamed it Oxford Hotel. It became the stopping point on the two-day trip between the two cities. In 1805, the Oxford post office was established. In 1833, Oxford was officially incorporated as a borough. Its first burgess (now called the mayor) was Thomas Alexander, who operated a general store thought to be the oldest building in Oxford. The northern half of Oxford was owned by the Dickey family in the 19th century. The Dickeys included the local Presbyterian minister, the Mr O'Malley of the local bank, a state Representative, and local businessmen. Reverend John Miller Dickey and his wife Sarah Emlen Cresson founded Ashmun Institute in 1854, and which later became Lincoln University. The family played a major role in re-routing the new Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad (P&BC;) through Oxford. Track was laid in the 1850s. The railroad reached Oxford in 1860 and later connected to Philadelphia and Baltimore.Garrett, Jerre. \\"The Baltimore Central Railroad Reaches Rising Sun.\\" Accessed 2011-09-14. By the time of the Civil War, Oxford was a bustling community. The business district on Third Street was entirely re-built at this time, including the Oxford Hotel (1858) and Oxford Hall (1862). Oxford became known for its confectionery and candy businesses and was the location of many manufacturing facilities. A second railroad, the Peach Bottom Railway, was built in the 1870s from Oxford to Peach Bottom. It carried farm products and passengers but was not profitable. It struggled through three bankruptcies and reorganized as the Lancaster, Oxford and Southern Railway, finally closing permanently in 1918. The Pennsylvania Railroad took control of the P&BC; on the eve of World War I.

It is situated in portions of two townships: Tredyffrin and Willistown. At the 2010 census, it had a total population of 5,575.  History  The town of Paoli grew around an inn kept in 1769 by Joshua Evans, whose father bought from William Penn in 1719 near the current site of the Paoli Post Office. Evans named his inn after General Pasquale Paoli, a Corsican, after Paoli had received the 45th and final toast at a Saint Patrick's Day celebration. The inn's location on the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike, about 20 miles (one day's drive for a horse-drawn wagon) from Philadelphia, contributed to its success. Battle of Paoli On the evening of September 20, 1777, near Paoli, General Charles Grey and nearly 5,000 British soldiers launched a surprise attack on a Patriot encampment, later known as the Battle of Paoli or \\"Paoli Massacre\\". Having intercepted General Washington's orders to General Wayne regarding British rearguard action, Grey set his troops upon the small regiment of Colonials commanded by General Anthony Wayne in an area near his home. Not wanting to lose the element of surprise, Grey allegedly ordered his troops to remove the flint from their muskets and to use only bayonets or swords to attack the sleeping Americans under the cover of darkness. With the help of a Loyalist spy who provided a secret password, \\"here we are and there they go\\" and led them to the camp, General \\"No-flint\\" Grey and the British having overrun several pickets launched the successful attack on the unsuspecting men of the Pennsylvania regiment, stabbing them to death as they slept. It was also alleged that the British soldiers took no prisoners during the attack, stabbing or setting fire to those who tried to surrender. Before it was over, nearly 200 Americans were killed or wounded. The battle became a rallying cry for the Americans against British atrocities for the rest of the Revolutionary War. The site of the battle is now part of nearby Malvern, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia Main Line The construction of the Main Line of Public Works across Pennsylvania enhanced the village's stature, as the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad passed through it. This became the Pennsylvania Railroad, which built suburban commuter lines out from Philadelphia in the late 19th century, spurring the growth of that city's suburbs. The largest and longest of these commuter lines, the \\"Main Line\\", terminated in Paoli. Philadelphia Folk Festival \\"The Homestead,\\" the fifteen-acre farm of Colley Wilson, on the south side of Swedesford Road, was the scene of the first annual Philadelphia Folk Festival in 1962, and remained at that site until 1965. It outgrew the space when an estimated 15,000 people attended the final year. The site has been subdivided. Gene Shay, a member of the Festival committee, observed after the first Festival, the site \\"with its spacious grassy valleys, clean running brooks, shaded hillsides and rustic barns, supplied the perfect background for all of the musical activity.\\" In those few years Acts such as Pete Seeger, Judy Collins, Mississippi John Hurt, Phil Ochs, Bill Monroe, Tom Rush, Tom Paxton, rev. Gary Davis, and Rambling Jack Elliott, Buffy Sainte- Marie and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band were among the many performers.https://tehistory.org/hqda/html/v18/v18n3p083.html Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of which is land.

Many locals still call the route \\"Lancaster Pike\\". Public transit For generations, Paoli was the western terminus of Pennsylvania Railroad commuter trains coming from Philadelphia on the Main Line. The \\"Paoli Local\\" became iconic in the western suburbs. Amtrak's Keystone Service and Pennsylvanian trains stop at the Paoli station, but with the decline of long-distance train travel, the stops are now less frequent. Paoli Station Commuters traveling by rail within Southeastern Pennsylvania use the Paoli station, although most local trains serving Paoli now terminate in Malvern, one stop to the west. SEPTA Regional Rail's Paoli/Thorndale Line (formerly R5) commuter rail runs between Thorndale and Philadelphia both ways every 30 minutes during the week. College students and city-working suburbanites take the Paoli/Thorndale Line to school and work.

It is located in the Philadelphia Metro Area. The population is 16,440 as of the 2010 Census. As noted by Forbes, Phoenixville is a former beaten- down mill town with a recent downtown revitalization plan that led to 10 craft breweries and a distillery. Downtown Phoenixville has more breweries per square foot than anywhere else in America.  History  Phoenixville Mural Originally called Manavon, Phoenixville was settled in 1732 and incorporated as a borough in 1849. In its industrial heyday early in the twentieth century, it was an important manufacturing center and it was the site of great iron and steel mills such as the Phoenix Iron Works, boiler works, silk mill, underwear and hosiery factories, a match factory, and the famous (and now highly collectible) Etruscan majolica pottery. Like many American towns and cities, Phoenixville owes its growth to its waterways. It is not only situated on the broad Schuylkill River, a historic thoroughfare to Native Americans and early settlers alike, but it is bisected by the fast-flowing French Creek, which was quickly harnessed for water power. Much of this history was recognized by the creation of the Phoenixville Historic District, the largest National Register of Historic Places site in Chester County. The Black Rock Bridge, Gay Street School, and Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Phoenixville Historical Society has a rotating display of historical artifacts in its museum. Etymology The first nail factory in the U.S., the French Creek Nail Works, was established in Phoenixville (then called Manavon) in 1790. In 1813, a bridge builder, Lewis Wernwag, became part owner and renamed it the Phoenix Iron Works. In 1840, new owners added a blast furnace. In 1855, a new group of owners incorporated as the Phoenix Iron Co. When the borough was incorporated in 1849, it incorporated the name of its major employer. After several ownership changes, the plant was completely shut down in 1949 and later acquired by the Barium Steel Corp. and renamed the Phoenix Iron & Steel Company, later The Phoenix Steel Corporation. The entire plant was shut down for the last time in 1987.

Economy Phoenix Iron Works foundry building. Phoenixville High SchoolChurch and Main StreetMain StreetBurning of the PhoenixPhoenixville has a diverse local economy that largely includes many local artisans and restaurants. Among the local hotspots are Steel City and the Colonial Theater, two establishments that survived both the economic downturn and Phoenixville's recent revitalization. While the plans for an economic revitalization began back in 2001, it was not until 2009 that first brewpub opened in Phoenixville. That brewpub was Iron Hill Brewery. Molly Maguire's Pub, both located on Bridge Street. Customers Bank, the nation's fourth-best community bank for return on equity in 2011, according to the American Bankers Association, is headquartered in downtown Phoenixville. One impact of economic revitalization has been the increase in the cost for residents living in Phoenixville which was partially the result of increased demand for housing caused by the growth of local restaurants, breweries and boutiques in town. Community leaders, the Phoenixville Borough Council, along with two consecutive mayors, saw the need to create an Affordable Housing Task Force to study what personal financial issues existed in the community, as well as to propose solutions to any housing issues they uncovered. That task force later became the Affordable Housing Council of Phoenixville. The Council's website states: \\"In Chester County, we recognized that the community was changing and Phoenixville needed to keep pace with the evolving demographics of its wonderful town. Our community saw an increase in homelessness as well as limited housing options for families and seniors/individuals with a limited income. Several of the local community leaders took it upon themselves to research the issue and gained the support from the Borough of Phoenixville to create a task force. The focus of the task force is to create affordable housing options for families and seniors/individuals with a fixed income.\\" In 2017, several community leaders and residents voiced support for the approval of Steel Town Village which was an affordable housing community, as well as the general need for affordable housing throughout the borough. Some opposed the project, but Borough Council approved the project.

Phoenixville is currently served by SEPTA's Route 99 bus, which connects with the Manayunk/Norristown Line Regional rail service at the Norristown Transportation Center, and the Route 139 bus, which connects the King of Prussia mall with Limerick. Several major railroads once served Phoenixville. The Reading Railroad entered the east side of town via a station above Bridge Street. The line passes under the north side of town in the Black Rock Tunnel, the third railroad tunnel constructed in the United States. Regular commuter trains last stopped at the Phoenixville Station in 1981, when SEPTA ceased operating non-electrified commuter lines. Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) currently utilizes the busy line on a daily basis as part of its Harrisburg Line. Phoenixville was also the place where the Pickering Valley Railroad joined the Reading. The Pickering Valley was operated as a subsidiary of the Reading until 1906, when it was merged into the Reading,\\"Pickering Valley Railroad was Completed on Sept. 1, 1871; Leased by the Reading\\", Reading Eagle, Aug 18, 1912, p. 18. and became the Pickering Valley Branch of that railroad.The Pickering Valley Railroad, AbandonedRails.com; accessed 2014.01.27. The branch was closed in the late 20th century, and most of the track has been removed.Tinsman, Mary Alfson, Memorandum: French Creek Parkway Project, May 16, 2011, CHRS, Inc. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) Schuylkill Branch also served Phoenixville. The line enters town crossing the Schuylkill River from neighboring Mont Clare on a high bridge, north of French Creek. The line passes along the north side of the former Phoenix Iron Works site. The station on Vanderslice Street, west of Gay Street, no longer exists. Past the Works, the line splits. The main fork passed through the now abandoned Phoenixville Tunnel, which partially collapsed in the 1990s, and continued toward Reading. The other fork continued along the Pickering Creek Valley and used to connect with the Main Line at Paoli. A section of the line remains in place, and is currently known as the Phoenixville Industrial track (also owned by NS). Passenger service ended in 1928 and regular freight service on the line ceased in 2004. During the 2008 replacement of the Gay Street Bridge, the line was severed at its crossing of Main Street and that rail bridge raised a few feet to allow emergency vehicles to reach the north side of town. Interest to resume passenger rail service was spurred by the Schuylkill Valley Metro (SVM) project, which was rejected by Federal Transit Administration in 2006. Another project, called the Greenline, has since been proposed an alternative to the SVM. It would utilize the Phoenixville Industrial track, to give Phoenixville a rail link to Philadelphia via Paoli and the Paoli/Thorndale Line of regional rail. The effort to resume passenger train service has led to the creation of the group Citizens for the Train.

History Thornbury Township was organized in 1687 with the appointment of Hugh Durborrow as constable and received its name from Thornbury, in Gloucestershire, England. At the time, no more than five or six families lived within the limits of the township. George Peirce, one of the earliest and most influential inhabitants of the township, was married to a native of Thornbury, England, and the township was purportedly named to compliment her. Thornbury, Birmingham and Westtown townships are the only townships within the present limits of Chester County which were organized before 1704. The township was divided when Delaware County was separated from Chester County in 1798. As a result, there is a Thornbury Township in each county. Landowners were allowed to choose which county they wished to be in, causing the line between the two townships, and the two counties, to be very irregular. History of Thornbury Township, Pa The Battle of Brandywine, part of the American Revolutionary War took place partially in the town.

The population was 1,492 at the 2010 census. History The area known as Toughkenamon was originally inhabited by Lenape Native Americans who spoke Unami.Grumet, R.S.(2014). www.nysm.nysed.gov. Retrieved from http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/common/nysm/files/nysmrecord-vol5-1.pdf In the original survey, in 1700, the surveyor notes that he crossed the Dochcanamon Hill. Other forms of spelling this name were used, such as Tokenamon, Taukenamon, Taughlikenemon. Thomas and Mary Rowland settled in the valley, near the present village of Toughkenamon, in 1706, being perhaps the first settlers who purchased lands in New Garden Township. They came to the township from old Ashton Township, old Chester County, now in Delaware County. Toughkenamon has been of significant importance in the development of the United States. First, the characteristics of the interactions between settlers and Lenapes was a microcosm of the conflicts that would occur in the future. For example, the farmers dug trenches around their crops, and filled them with water, to prevent reoccurrence of the conflagration that occurred when local Lenapes started a burn. The fact that the original Toughkenamon settlers maintained water-filled trenches is evidence that they had dialogue and an understanding of the importance of the burn. The traditional burn was an ancient way to increase yields of local grains and tubers, and increase the deer population. But later settlers no longer interacted with the departed tribe, so falsely assumed the burns had been solely aimed at destroying their ancestors' crops, adding to mistrust of remaining Native-American families in nearby counties. Toughkenamon Hill has been quarried for centuries. In later centuries Toughkenamon was considered a village. It was an early industrial center due to its strategic location on the old Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., easy access to raw materials such as wood, water and ore. Even today, businesses critical to national wholesale distribution of perishable foods are located in and near Toughkenamon.

Notable peopleTransportation West Chester Transportation Center The main east-west road to West Chester is West Chester Pike, which begins in Upper Darby, Delaware County, just outside Philadelphia, and is part of Pennsylvania Route 3 (PA 3). The West Chester Pike originally existed as a private turnpike connecting Philadelphia and West Chester between 1850 and 1918, when it became a public road. In West Chester, PA 3 follows Market Street eastbound and Gay Street westbound. The main north-south road in West Chester is High Street. To the north of town, the road is known as Pottstown Pike, which connects to PA 100 near Exton (Route 100 formerly ran through town). To the south of town, the road is known as Wilmington-West Chester Pike (US 202 and US 322). US 202 and US 322 both bypass the center of West Chester on the limited-access West Chester Bypass, with US 202 heading northeast to King of Prussia and south to Wilmington, Delaware and US 322 heading northwest to Downingtown and southeast to Chester. US 322 Business passes through West Chester along Hannum Avenue, Chestnut and Market streets, and South High Street. Other state routes serving West Chester include PA 162 and PA 842, which head west towards Unionville, and PA 52, which heads southwest towards Kennett Square. West Chester is home to the West Chester Transportation Center, which serves as a parking garage for the Chester County Justice Center and a bus terminal, which is located on the lower level of the facility. Two of SEPTA's Suburban Division bus routes serve West Chester. The Route 92 bus connects West Chester to the Exton Transportation Center and the King of Prussia Transit Center, while the Route 104 bus runs between West Chester University and the 69th Street Transportation Center, mostly following West Chester Pike. The Route 104 bus replaced a trolley service that connected West Chester to Philadelphia along the West Chester Pike between 1898 and the 1950s. West Chester is also served by the Transportation Management Association of Chester County's SCCOOT, which provides service to Kennett Square and Oxford, and Krapf's Transit's Route \\"A\\", which provides service to Exton, Downingtown, and Coatesville. Until September 1986, West Chester was served by SEPTA's R3 commuter rail line, then known as the Media/West Chester line. Service on the line was discontinued because of poor track conditions west of the Elwyn station. At the time, SEPTA had limited funds for the necessary repairs and offered Chester County the option of either improving the rail line or expanding parking availability at the nearby Exton station on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line. The county opted for the latter, and service on the line was cut back to its current terminus of Elwyn. The rail line into West Chester is used by the West Chester Railroad, a heritage railroad. The oldest continuously running cab company in the area is Rainbow Cab and Limousine, which offers an 85% discount for seniors; it has been in operation since 1952 under a variety of names.

The population was 2,854 at the 2010 census. History The village of West Grove derived its name from the Friends Meeting House on Harmony Road built in 1787 several miles west of the Friends Meeting House in the village of London Grove. West Grove was separated from London Grove Township and became an incorporated borough on November 29, 1893. However, the decree of incorporation was not recorded until January 9, 1894, to prevent confusing the tax accounts of London Grove Township and to eliminate the need for a special borough election. The move for incorporation followed several years of significant growth in West Grove that began to develop with the coming of the Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad in 1860. On March 28, 1885, the Daily Local News described West Grove as \\"one of the most flourishing villages in this county\\" and stated that \\"it contains some three flouring mills and the largest nursery for rose culture [see below] in the United States (Dinger & Conrad, Co.), a large casket factory (Paxson Comfort) and a large number of dwellings.\\" In May 1885, the Chester County Democrat reported that thirty new homes were under construction in the village of West Grove. The \\"Father of West Grove\\" was Joseph Pyle. Born in Penn Township in 1836, Joseph Pyle opened a general store in 1860 in the brick building that is currently empty but housed a Rite Aid Pharmacy, Eckerd Pharmacy, and West Grove Pharmacy in the past. This building was constructed by Pyle and is believed to be the oldest brick structure in the center of town. Joseph Pyle constructed many of the commercial buildings along the present-day Exchange Place, including the Roselyn Theater Building in 1867 (torn down in 1980), the National Bank of West Grove building in 1883 and the K&P; Building in 1885. Appointed postmaster of the borough by President Lincoln in 1864, Pyle served twenty-two years. Furthermore, Pyle introduced the manufacture of brick, planned and installed the first public water system, was President of the West Grove Improvement Company which financed the construction of the casket factory in 1885, served on Borough Council and was Burgess (Mayor) from 1900-1903. The first election of borough officials was held in the West Grove Hotel on February 20, 1894. John P. Cheyney was elected the first Burgess (Mayor) in what amounted to a Democratic landslide. The Democrats won every office including Mayor, six school directors, two Squires, Constable, Assessor and Tax Collector, two Assistant Assessors, three Auditors, Town Clerk and High Constable. The first council meeting was held March 6, 1894, in the Library Room on the second floor of the National Bank Building on Exchange Place. The current mayor of West Grove is Stephen B. Black, Republican, who has been in office since August 2000. Home of the Roses Our new guide to rose culture, Dingee & Conard Co. catalog, 1899 In 1868 Charles Dingee and Alfred Fellenberg Conard founded the Dingee & Conard Nursery, a commercial grower of fruit trees, roses and other nursery products.

West Marlborough Township is a second class township, governed by a three-member Board of Supervisors who meet monthly at the township garage in the village of Doe Run. Other elected officials include an auditor, constable, and political party committee members. A Planning Commission is appointed by the supervisors and serve to advise the supervisors as to real estate subdivision, zoning, the township comprehensive plan, and similar matters. History For many years the King Ranch was the largest landowner in West Marlborough Township and adjoining municipalities Newlin and East Fallowfield townships. The ranch property, operated as Buck and Doe Run Valley Farms, Inc., received Texas longhorn cattle shipped north by railroad for fattening on the lush grass of eastern Pennsylvania before being delivered to cattle markets for sale and slaughter. The heart of the King Ranch property was preserved by land conservation easements in the 1980s through the tireless efforts of a number of local public spirited citizens. Today, much of the rich pasture and scenic vistas remain preserved perpetually from encroachment by intensive land development. Over time, the King Ranch still remains true to its roots with many families still today living there their whole life.
