His ancestors converted from Judaism to Shia Islam. Asgaroladi was amongst the world's wealthiest Iranians, and was named the third richest Iranian in the world and was the second wealthiest in Iran, with an estimated wealth in excess of $10 billion. His business empire dates back to the 1970s and, since then, Asgaroladi became one of the leading exporters of dried fruits, nuts and spices from Iran. Asgaroladi was the president of Hasas Co. which is the leading exporter of nuts and pistachios from Iran since 1953. Asgaroladi increased his wealth dramatically in the 90's when there were two official exchange rates for the US dollar. Those with trade license could obtain the lower exchange rate of 1750 rials but the market value of US dollars was at 8000 rials. During this period his brother Habibollah Asgaroladi was the commerce minister responsible for handing out trade licenses to obtain the lower exchange rate. He used his connections to obtain large quantities of US dollars at low exchange rate and resold them at the market value price for a profit of more than 300%.Saints and Sinners, Ali Mahmood, 2013, HarperCollins Publishers India, page 205. Asgaroladi was a well known member of the Iranian business community (his brother was Minister of Commerce for many years) and he held the Presidency of several international Chambers of Commerce including the Iran-China, Iran-Australia, Iran-Russia and Iran-Canada Chambers of Commerce. Asgaroladi was reported as being in negotiations to purchase Iran Air / \\"Homa\\", Iran's heavily national carrier and was quoted in media sources as wishing to acquire the Tehran International Trade and Exhibition Centre, a vast conference and exhibition centre in northern Tehran. He also owned a majority stake in three retail Chinese banks. Asgaroladi on numerous occasions proposed setting up an Iran-China bank. According to Forbes Magazine, Asgaroladi was the secret business partner of Swiss-based US-i billionaire and fugitive Marc Rich in helping bypass U.S. sanctions against Iran after the Iranian revolution.

Born in Hayfield, Derbyshire, he began his playing career in local-league football with Godley Athletic and Copley Celtic. In 1919, he joined Lancashire Combination side Stalybridge Celtic. The club was one of the founder members of the Football League Third Division North two years later, and Mace made one league appearance for them. Stalybridge left the Football League in 1923 to play in the Cheshire County League, where Mace was described as one of the best goalkeepers in the competition. In May 1925, he was signed by Third Division North side Nelson, for a transfer fee of ¬£100, as an understudy to Harry Abbott. He found it difficult to supplant Abbott and hence it was almost a year before he made his Nelson debut in the 3‚Äì3 draw with Chesterfield on 20 April 1926. It was another twelve months before Mace was selected for the team again, returning for the 6‚Äì2 win against Hartlepools United on 9 April 1927. He remained in goal for the following five matches, but the team suffered defeat in all five games and Mace was dropped following a 2‚Äì7 loss away at New Brighton. He made his final appearance for Nelson in the final match of the 1926‚Äì27 season, a 0‚Äì2 home defeat to Tranmere Rovers. During his time with Nelson, Mace was a regular starter for the reserve team and missed only one match as the side won the Lancashire Combination in 1925‚Äì26.

Early life and Canon Regular Forret was descended from an old family which possessed the estate of Forret in the parish of Logie, Fife, from the reign of William the Lion till the seventeenth century. The surname is sometimes erroneously given as Forrest. His father had been master stabler to James IV. The Catholic priest, Sir John Forret, for permitting whom to administer the sacrament of baptism at Swinton in 1573 the Bishop of St Andrews was complained against, was probably a near relative. After obtaining a good preliminary education, Forret was, through the \\"help of a rich lady,\\" sent to study at Cologne. On his return he became a canon regular in the monastery of \\"Sanct Colmes Inche\\" (Inchcolm in the Firth of Forth). The canons having, it is said, begun to manifest their discontent at their daily allowance, the abbot, in order to divert their attention from their personal grievances, gave them the works of Augustine to study instead of the book of their foundation. Its perusal effected a radical change in the thoughts of many of the recluses. \\"O happy and blessed,\\" afterwards said Forret, \\"was that book by which I came to the knowledge of the truth!\\" The abbot to whom he made known his change of opinions advised him to keep his mind to himself; but Forret converted the younger canons, although \\"the old bottels,\\" he said, \\"would not receive the new wine.\\" Vicar of Dollar Afterwards he became vicar of Dollar, Clackmannanshire, where he preached every Sunday to his parishioners on the Epistles and Gospels. At that time in Scotland, only black friars (Dominicans) and grey friars (Franciscans) were in the habit of preaching. The friars, offended at the innovation, denounced him to George Crichton, the Bishop of Dunkeld as a heretic, and one that \\"shewed the mysteries of the Scriptures to the vulgar people in English.\\" The bishop, who had no interest whatever in ecclesiastical controversies, remonstrated with Forret not only for preaching \\"every Sunday,\\" but for the more serious offence of not taking the usual due from the parishioners when any one died, of \\"the cow and the uppermost cloth,\\" remarking that the people would expect others to do as he did. He advised Forret, therefore, if he was determined to preach, to preach only on \\"one good Epistle or one good Gospell that setteth forth the libertie of the holie church.\\" On Forret explaining that he had never found any evil epistle or gospel in the New or Old Testament, then \\"spake my lord stoutlie and said, 'I thank God that I never knew what the Old and the New Testament was.'\\" This innocent instance of devout gratitude on the part of the bishop gave rise to a proverb in Scotland: \\"Ye are like the Bishop of Dunkeld that knew neither the new law nor the old law.\\" Forret systematically warned his parishioners against the sellers of indulgences. He also took care specially to teach them the ten commandments, and composed a short catechism for their instruction on points of prime importance in Christian belief. He was in the habit of carrying bread and cheese in his gown sleeve to any poor person who was ill. He studied from six in the morning till twelve, and again from dinner till supper, and, in order the better to hold his own against disputants, committed three chapters of the New Testament in Latin to memory every day, making his servant, Andrew Kirkie, hear him repeat them at night. Trial and execution Though summoned several times before the Bishop of Dunkeld, he escaped further interference until February 1539‚Äì40, when he and four others were summoned before David Beaton (the archbishop of St Andrews), Gavin Dunbar (the archbishop of Glasgow), and William Chisholm (the Bishop of Dunblane) as \\"chief heretics and teachers of heresy,\\" and especially for being present at the marriage of the vicar of Tullibodie, and for eating flesh during Lent at the marriage. They were burned on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh on 28 February.

(later Mancunian Films) at the Albany Studios in London.Richards p.196 The premiere of the film was in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent.

Blakeley had no prior experience in film production; he had seen comedian George Formby doing his stage act and approached him to star in a feature film. Blakeley's modest studio was a one-room loft space above a taxi garage. The makeshift stage was not soundproofed, so whenever the crew members wanted to film a scene, they had to signal the garage to stop its noisy work below. The studio also had pictorial limitations, and couldn't replicate much more than simple room interiors (many scenes were staged in cramped corners). Thus the nightclub scenes in Boots! Boots! were filmed in near-darkness, hiding the absence of set decorations, with a single spotlight trained on the performer being photographed. The film is a patchwork of songs and jokes tied to the misadventures of bumbling John Willie, played by Formby. (\\"John Willie\\" was a character made famous by Formby's father, George Formby, Sr., in music halls of the early 1900s.) Despite the crude photography and recording, and the minuscule budget of ¬£3,000, Boots! Boots! became an enormous hit. It was reissued in 1938, in a shortened 55-minute form, to capitalize on Formby's later fame; for six decades this abridged version was the only one in circulation, until an uncut, 80-minute print was located and restored for DVD release.

The fossil acted as a baffle to trap sediment. Historically interpreted as a sponge or hydrozoan, recent studies are converging to its classification in the coralline stem group, placing it among the red algae.  Morphology  The thalloid organism had a series of internal canals opening on one side of the body (presumably the upper side), and volcano-like protuberances on that same side inviting comparison to filter- feeding organisms. On the other hand, it seems to have had a calcified cellular make up akin to that of the coralline reds, suggesting that it was either a stem-group coralline or a coralline-encrusted filter feeder.  Distribution  The organism is widespread in the tropical and near-tropical margin of the Laurentian continent (45‚Äì15¬∞N), but is not found elsewhere. Its oldest reported occurrence is Middle Pennsylvanian (mid- to late Moscovian) and youngest is the late Sakmarian. It acts as an important reservoir rock for oil deposits.

The character came to mainstream attention during a 1990s story arc where her boyfriend Stone Cates dies from AIDS and Robin is diagnosed as HIV-positive. Robin is also famous in the soap community for having been one of the few long-term soap characters to age in real time, not SORASed like most other child actors. Casting A 7-year-old McCullough was one of three actresses narrowed down for the part of 5-year-old Robin and was brought in to screen test with her on-screen parents Finola Hughes (Anna Devane) and Tristan Rogers (Robert Scorpio). Hughes recalled the event to MSN TV: \\"We just started improvising with her, like anything. We were throwing things at her and she was just talking away. Tristan and I were looking at each other over her head going, 'This is it! This is what we wanted.'\\" Improvisation skills were key for General Hospital's process in the 1980s. As Hughes explained: \\"It was very improvised. Very loose. We used to just talk around the plot and maybe every now and again dip our toe in the actual storyline.\\" McCullough debuted on September 6, 1985 and stayed with the series until September 12, 1996. Afterward, she returned as a series regular for brief stints: January 17, 1997 to February 3, 1997; March 12, 1997 to April 8, 1997; June 23, 1997 to August 8, 1997; December 11, 1997 to January 20, 1999; June 20‚Äì21, 2000 (for The Nurses' Ball); and July 16, 2004. She appeared on Port Charles in 1998, for one episode. She also appeared on May 30 to June 4, 2001 on All My Children when Robin reunited with her mother Anna. McCullough returned to General Hospital as Robin on July 16, 2004 for the funeral of Lila Quartermaine before rejoining the soap full-time on October 12, 2005. She also appeared on both seasons of the spin-off series General Hospital: Night Shift in 2007 and 2008. For her work as Robin, McCullough has won two Daytime Emmy Awards, one for Outstanding Juvenile Female in 1989 and one for Outstanding Younger Actress in 1996. McCullough also earned two Soap Opera Digest Awards, for Outstanding Youth Actor/Actress in 1986 and Outstanding Child Actor in 1993, as well as a 1987 Young Artist Award. In November 2011, McCullough announced her plans to leave General Hospital in the early months of 2012 to pursue her dream of directing full-time. This came only weeks after a controversial plot, where Lisa Niles (portrayed by Brianna Brown) threatens to inject Robin's blood into her husband, Patrick Drake, which was hard on McCullough and her co-star Jason Thompson considering Robin's critically acclaimed HIV-story. While the character was killed off on February 21, 2012, McCullough continued to make several appearances as an apparition in numerous scenes with her loved ones. Frank Valentini, Ron Carlivati, and McCullough discussed her departure, and Carlivati, who was uncomfortable with the idea of Robin being \\"completely dead\\", rewrote her story. McCullough's scene on March 27, 2012 showed Robin to be alive, leaving the door open for her to return. On July 16, 2012, Soap Opera Digest announced that McCullough would return to the series for a series of guest spots. She started her series of guest starring spots on July 19, 2012 and lasted until July 27, 2012. In the fall of 2012, Soap Opera Digest confirmed that McCullough would reprise her role as Robin starting on November 6 until December 19, 2012. She guest-starred for one episode on March 25, 2013, in a video message Robin left for Patrick. On August 21, 2013, Soap Opera Digest exclusively confirmed that McCullough had signed a contract to return to the series. McCullough made her on-screen return on September 30, 2013. In January 2014, McCullough confirmed her exit from the series once more, last airing on March 4, 2014. On June 23, 2014, McCullough revealed on her Twitter account that she's received GH scripts, this was later confirmed by Valentini that McCullough would be returning as Robin in the summer. Her first airdate back was on August 5, 2014 and she last aired on September 24, 2014. On January 19, 2015, McCullough guest-starred for one episode as Robin. In October 2015, it was announced that she would once again reprise the role of Robin in November. McCullough aired on November 13, 2015, and departed on January 7, 2016. In April 2016, it was revealed that McCullough was to briefly return for The Nurses' Ball, first appearing on May 9 and departing on May 27. In October 2016, it was revealed that McCullough will be reprising the role, first appearing on October 27 and departing on November 1. In December 2016, McCullough returned for yet another arc, appearing on December 28 and departing on January 19, 2017. McCullough reappeared from February 20, 2017 until March 10, 2017. In April 2017, Valentini revealed that McCullough was back on-set of the soap for further appearances. McCullough returned for two episodes on May 18 and 19. In November 2017, it was announced that McCullough would reprise the role again to facilitate Steve Burton's return to the series. McCullough returned on November 17 and departed on December 4. McCullough returned from February 6 to 13, 2018, for the funeral of Nathan West. In April 2018, it was reported that McCullough would made a short-term appearance for the Nurses Ball.

Storylines = 1993‚Äì2001 = Robin Soltini arrives in Port Charles in 1985 with the woman she believes to be her grandmother, Filomena Soltini. She had grown up thinking her mother, Anna Devane, was a family friend. Her father, Robert Scorpio, has no idea that he shares a daughter with Anna and is surprised to find Robin in his living room. During her childhood, Robin's grandmother is killed and she is faced with threats from enemies of her parents such as Cesar Faison, Grant Putnam and Olivia St. John and she also faces tough times when her parents are supposedly murdered in a boat explosion in 1992, leaving her to be raised by her Uncle Mac Scorpio. Mac later marries Felicia Cummings, and Robin is raised with her daughters, Maxie and Georgie Jones. In 1993, Robin meets Michael \\"Stone\\" Cates (Michael Sutton), and although they initially do not get along, they began dating in 1994 against her Uncle Mac's wishes. Stone had been a street kid now taken in and working for Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard). In 1995, Stone learns he is HIV+ and eventually contracts AIDS due to his length of time without treatment. After his first HIV test came back negative, he did not take another one six months later. Robin and her family are shocked to learn that she is also HIV+. Robin and Stone fall deeply in love, and she is devastated when Stone eventually dies from AIDS. Robin is at Jason Morgan (Steve Burton)'s bedside when he wakes up from a coma following a car accident caused by his brother (Sean Kanan). A few months later, they begin to bond and start dating. Jason helps Robin cope with Stone's death and her medical status, while Robin helps Jason cope with his memory loss following the accident. They fall in love despite protests from her uncle Mac Scorpio (John J. York). She introduces him to Sonny Corinthos, soon his employer, and the three become friends. Robin eventually enrolls in school at Yale, returning on weekends and holidays to visit. After an emotional break-up with Jason due to his involvement with the mob, Robin leaves Port Charles. She returns in 1998 to help her best friend Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil) from her recent break-up. During this time, Robin becomes friends with Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) and the two bond over their similar childhoods. Robin reconciles with Jason and they move in together with baby Michael, who Jason is taking care of for his friend Carly. However, their relationship begins to deteriorate when Carly moves home and into their cottage. Robin eventually reveals to Jason's brother A.J. (Billy Warlock) that he (and not Jason) is the father of Carly's son. Jason is furious and they end their relationship. Robin leaves town heartbroken in 1999, moving to Paris. She returns the following year for The Annual Nurses' Ball. In 2001, Robin travels to Pine Valley, Pennsylvania where she is reunited with her mother Anna, who is revealed to be alive, having spent the past nine years recovering from her injuries. She also meets her aunt Alex Marick, Anna's identical twin sister. In 2003, Anna calls Robin to inform her that her half-sister, Leora, has died. Anna leaves Pine Valley that same year to live with Robin in Paris. = 2004‚Äì18 = Robin returns to Port Charles in 2004 for Lila Quartermaine's funeral. She later returns the following year to help save Jason's life, and brings Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson) to town to operate. Robin and Patrick bicker and flirt, and eventually start dating despite Patrick's anti-commitment reputation. They work together during an encephalitis outbreak in February 2006. The crisis brings Robin's presumed-dead father to town, Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers), but he leaves shortly thereafter. Robin sees him again when she joins Lulu Spencer (then Julie Marie Berman) and Dillon Quartermaine (Scott Clifton) to the Markham Islands to rescue Robert and Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary). She also sees her mother Anna Devane, having previously found out she was alive and reunited with her in 2001 in Pine Valley. Meanwhile, Robin and Patrick admit their love for one another. In late 2006, they help Luke Spencer reconnect with his catatonic wife, Laura, with an experimental drug. In early 2007, Robin is part of a group held hostage at the Metro Court Hotel and is shot in the abdomen because the district attorney was Sonny's half-brother Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst). A few months later, Robin realizes she wants to have a child while Patrick strongly does not, and they break up after befriending Ric. In late 2007, after the funeral of her cousin Georgie Jones (Lindze Letherman), Robin goes to Patrick for comfort and they sleep together. Robin discovers she is pregnant, but does not tell Patrick since she had been planning on using a sperm donor. Patrick figures out the truth, and the couple slowly starts to become close again. In the summer of 2008, Robin's father is diagnosed with colon cancer but pulls through. Patrick proposes to Robin but she turns him down. They eventually plan an October wedding, which is cut short when Robin goes into labor. Robin names the baby Emma Grace Scorpio- Drake, who, after a brief scare, is shown not to be infected by Robin's HIV. Patrick and Robin wed the day after Christmas. In early 2009, Robin begins suffering from postpartum depression. After months of refusing help, she agrees to treatment and eventually bonds with her daughter. In early 2010, Robin and Patrick begin to bicker. In June, Robin takes a trip to Africa to help with an AIDS program. Patrick is upset to not be included in her decision, and voices his jealousy over her connection to her late boyfriend Stone. The night Robin returns, Patrick sleeps with Lisa Niles (Brianna Brown). Lisa slowly begins to show her jealousy after Patrick refuses to sleep with her again. Lisa cuts Robin out of photos, steals Robin's HIV medicine and takes Emma from the babysitter. Patrick confesses his affair to Robin and she kicks him out of the house. She confronts Lisa, who then intentionally jumps in front of Robin's car and claims Robin tried to kill her. Lisa replaces Robin's medication with sedatives, resulting in Robin crashing her car. Lisa kidnaps her, and Robin escapes but falls in a well. Suffering from exhaustion and hypothermia, she hallucinates Stone. Patrick eventually finds Robin, with Lisa close after him. Lisa attempts to shoot herself and is sent to a mental institution. She returns shortly, having passed her psychiatric evaluations. After Emma's birthday party, a fire starts and Lisa saves Robin and Emma. Robin accuses Lisa of starting the fire, and Lisa petitions to have Robin fired. Robin's cousin Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) catches Lisa attempting to inject Robin's IV bag with sodium pentothal, and Lisa flees. She is put on probation and her petition against Robin is dismissed. In early 2011, Robin serves as the maid of honor at Sonny's wedding to Brenda Barrett. Brenda is kidnapped and injected with a neurotoxin, and Robin saves her with an antidote. Patrick comforts Robin during the crisis and they begin to repair their relationship. When Jake Spencer is hit by a car and dies, Robin realizes life is short and reconciles with Patrick. Lisa attempts to kill Robin and frame Patrick, but they figure out her plan and she is arrested. In late June 2011, Lisa holds Robin, Patrick, Steve and Maxie hostage at General Hospital. Eventually there is a struggle where Lisa lets Patrick inject her with drain cleaner. She falls into a coma. Meanwhile, Robin is appointed Chief of Staff. When Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) kidnaps his daughter Josslyn Jacks, he goes to Robin for help. Sonny finds them and accidentally shoots Robin in the arm instead of Jax. In October, Robin and Patrick join Matt, Elizabeth, Steven Webber (Scott Reeves) and Olivia Falconeri (Lisa LoCicero) on a boat to celebrate Matt's medical achievement. Lisa sneaks on board and ties up Patrick and Robin. Lisa tries to inject Patrick with Robin's blood, but Robin and Lisa struggle and Lisa runs away. Lisa is found dead and everyone becomes suspects. In December, Robin tells Jason her HIV meds are not working. She later works on a protocol to save Jason, who is again experiencing head trauma. She is caught in a lab explosion and presumed dead, later seen being held captive. Her captor is seen to be Ewen Keenan (Nathin Butler), later revealed to be working for Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roch√©) because she was rid of by Joe Scully, Jr. (Richard Steinmetz). She is later seen being held captive by Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan), shown to be Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) in disguise. After Faison is apprehended, his accomplice Dr. Obrecht (Kathleen Gati) tries to kill Robin, and her father Robert catches her. They struggle and Robert is injected, falling into a coma. Obrecht escapes with Robin and takes her to Jerry. Robin is revealed to be held on Cassadine Island by Jerry, forced to find a cure for Jerry's illness in late 2013 after she was ordered to revive his henchman Franco (Roger Howarth). Robin is eventually found by Nikolas, who came to Cassadine Island to find Dr. Obrecht. However, Jerry manages to trap her parents, also pursuing Obrecht, and tells Robin to develop the cure or her parents will die. Robin is held captive on Wyndemere by Faison and Obrecht with Nikolas and Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud), Obrecht's daughter with Faison right where Stephen Clay (Michael Easton; AKA Caleb Morley) was. Robin finds out that Patrick is engaged to Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) after Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise), Ava Jerome (Maura West), and Julian Jerome (William deVry) told Patrick and Sonny that they saw Robin alive. Britt offers to help her find the cure by getting her access to the hospital lab because Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan) was killed. Anna and Robert manage to escape, overpower Jerry, and manage to capture Faison and Obrecht. Robin immediately leaves to go to Patrick and Sabrina's wedding ceremony, where she shares a reunion with Patrick and Emma. She also shares a reunion with Maxie, who was at the time, contemplating a suicide attempt. Meanwhile, Robin asks Sabrina to break up with Patrick, but Sabrina refuses, saying Patrick should make his own decision. Eventually, Patrick chooses Robin and they reunite in time to celebrate Christmas as a family with Emma and happy to see her longtime friend Sonny Corinthos after he got released from prison and meeting Obrecht from his cell. Robin applies to be the chief of staff, but before that, she told Sonny that she's very sorry for his loss, after she told him that, then she goes on to get that chief of staff position, but is overlooked, after Obrecht secures the position following her own deal with the WSB. Patrick and Robin find out Sabrina's pregnant, but she claims that Patrick is not the baby's father. Robin then gets a visit from Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis), who reveals he's the WSB director who arranged Obrecht's release. He tells Robin he wants her to revive his sister-in-law, Helena (Constance Towers) and nephew, Stavros Cassadine (Robert Kelker-Kelly) just like she did with Franco. After refusing to help Victor, he reveals that he has also been holding Jason, and that Robin could revive him as well, if she helped in resurrecting Helena and Stavros. They leave town together on March 4, 2014, and head to the Crichton-Clark Clinic in New York City and she hadn't got a chance to say goodbye to her longtime friend Sonny. Robin later confirms that Jason is indeed alive. On August 5, 2014, Patrick runs into Robin at the Crichton-Clark Clinic. He was there with Sam Morgan looking for answers on a former patient, Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford). Robin tells him that she can't leave the clinic. Patrick then see a cryogenic chamber, and he asks if Jason is in there. Robin says that it is Stavros Cassadine, and that Jason is not there. She tells Patrick that Jason's organs were failing, and he soon died. Patrick then leaves after Robin says her work is more important than her family. Victor Cassadine later comes to the lab on August 7, 2014. He tells Robin that he hopes Patrick doesn't find out about Jason. It is confirmed that Jason indeed alive, and Robin lied to Patrick. Victor reveals he asked Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) to run Patrick and Emma off the road as a warning to Robin, showing he's holding her hostage. The accident ultimately led to the death of Patrick's son, Gabriel. Robin last appears talking to Jason in the cryogenic chamber. At the clinic, Victor orders Robin to use her new concoction on Jason. But she prefers using it on his relatives, Helena Cassadine or Stavros Cassadine instead. Victor refuses, and orders her to try it on Jason first to see if he wakes up or not, before trying it on the Cassadines. Victor calls in his goons to hold back Robin while he tries her new formula on Jason by injecting him with the serum. Robin asks Victor to let her and Jason leave after her formula works and Jason moves his hand, but Victor has other plans for Jason and gets his goons to throw Robin out, betraying her by telling her he doesn't need her anymore as her work is done and he's planning to keep Jason.

Redmond was the husband of the late production designer and illustrator, Dorothea Holt Redmond, who helped design Main Street in Disneyland and the Seattle Space Needle. Biography =Early life= Born in Brooklyn, Redmond was the son of Harry Redmond Sr., an early special effects artist and film producer.

Biography  P√©ter Szalai plays North-Indian classical music and is one of the best west-born tabla musicians of our time. In his childhood he played the piano, and as stepson of Gy√∂rgy Petri at the age of 16 on the advice of a family friend Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, he chose the Indian tabla drum pair as his instrument. The tabla is also a curiosity even among other Indian percussion instruments: it can be tuned to a specific pitch. The many layers of skin and the special finger technique ensures a distinctive polyrhythmical sound. Because of all this the tabla does not only fill the role of a rhythmical instrument, but it also has a rich tone and musicality. In the beginning P√©ter Szalai was the student of the magnificent Anthony Dass (Delhi gharana) between 1982 and 1984 in both Budapest and India. In 1979/80 he tried himself in two formations, the Creative Studio Five (CS√ñ) led by Zolt√°n Krulik and the Dimension led by L√°szl√≥ D√©s. Since 1980 he works together with the Indian classical music-playing Calcutta Trio (Kozma Andr√°s sitar, Moln√°r Andr√°s tanpura) and the Mak√°m formation (he was also founder of the latter and played in it until 1991). In 1987 he played as a guest performer at the Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw with the S. Kulpowicz International Band on tabla and on other percussion instruments. In 1988, during a longer Western European tour and recording, he played alongside Albert Mangelsdorf, W. Dauner and the Family of Percussion. The world-famous tabla master, Ustad Alla Rakha invited him to be his student. Upon his effect he still strictly follows the traditions of the Punjab gharana. Parallel to this, he also developed a special master-student bond with Pandit Ravi Shankar, who he considers his guru (master) not only in the field of Indian classical music. Aside from being a frequent guest of several Indian music festivals, he has intensive and lasting connections with his master's sons ‚Äì Ustad Zakir Hussain, Fazal Qureshi and Taufiq Qureshi ‚Äì even after the death of Ustad Alla Rakha in 2000. As the member of the Calcutta Trio he plays classical Indian music since 1980 to this day. The club of the formation is still functioning and meets monthly at the Marczib√°nyi Square Cultural Centre. Besides being the member of the Calcutta Trio, he has given many thousands of concerts since 1980. Many prominent Indian musicians chose him as partner in Europe since the beginning of the 90s: Pr. Debu Choudury, Nandkishor Muley (santur), Gaurav Mazumdar (sitar), Shubhendra Rao (sitar) Ustad Ikhlaq Hussain Khan (sitar) and Debasish Ganguly (sitar). In 1992, while still playing in a duo, he founded the Tin Tin with Szabolcs Sz≈ëke. Since 1994 he is a member of the Tin Tin Quartet and after a small hiatus he returned to the formation in 1997 which was at that time called the Tin Tin Quintet. In 2000 he contributed together with violinist Zolt√°n Lantos, jazz guitarist G√°bor Juh√°sz and his own student Iv√°n Nyusztay to the establishment of the Samsara Quartet. In 2002 the group also published a record. At present he is still a wanted musician for different jazz, etno and fusion productions. Since 2003 and 2006 he plays in such multi-faceted formations as Mitsoura (M√≥nika Miczura, Andr√°s Monori, M√°rk Moldvai, Mikl√≥s Luk√°cs, √âva Mandula), the Mikl√≥s Luk√°cs Quintet (Mikl√≥s Luk√°cs, M√°ty√°s Szandai, Andr√°s D√©s, Krist√≥f Bacs√≥), the M. Trio (Evelin T√≥th, D√°niel Kardos) and the Rub√°i Tri√≥ (Szabolcs Sz≈ëke and Evelin T√≥th), among others. As a guest performer he played at the concerts of Amadinda, the Dresch Quartet, Bea Palya, √Ågi Szal√≥ki and more. He participated in the production of many records like Peter Ogi, Palle Mikkelborg, Djabe, Tibor Szemz≈ë and others. He considers teaching at RIMPA (Ravi Shankar Institute for Music and Performing Arts) an important part of his work. He was invited by Zolt√°n R√°cz to the Franz Liszt Music Academy where he teaches classical Indian music theory for classical and jazz music students since 2009. In 2010 he organised the Spirit and Sound and String and Spirit performer nights with such musicians like Bea Palya, √Ågi Szal√≥ki, Mikl√≥s Luk√°cs, K√°lm√°n Balogh, R√≥zsa Farkas, and the Mikl√≥s Luk√°cs Quintet. A biographical documentary short film was made in 2011 about Peter Szalai titled Without Sheet Music. A portrait film made in 2013 about him titled Angel in the Details.

He first appeared in the eleventh series episode \\"Proceed With Caution\\", broadcast on 9 June 2009\\\\. Oliver was introduced alongside his older sister, Penny (Emma Catherwood), as a Foundation House Officer 1 (F1) on rotation at Holby City Hospital. Series producer Diana Kyle intended their inclusion to have an \\"instant impact on the wards.\\" Anderson was selected to play Oliver; he spent time with a real F1 doctor and trained with the programme's medical advisors to prepare for the part. It took him around six months to ease into the role, and a further six to feel comfortable in it. Oliver was initially portrayed as \\"the golden boy\\" compared to his sister. Boyishly charming and medically talented, he nonetheless lacked confidence in his ability. When Oliver reached his F2 training, the series formed an on-screen duo by pairing him with registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). Oliver's lack of competency was highlighted ‚Äì he endangered patients and landed his colleagues in trouble. In a prominent storyline, Oliver made a series of medical errors, which forced him to admit that he cheated on an exam at medical school. He began a downward spiral, and reached \\"rock bottom\\" when Penny was killed off. He was then central to a special flashback episode, which depicted his battle to cope with her death. Though he confessed to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) that he was not truly qualified, Hanssen allowed Oliver to continue practising medicine. Branded a Lothario-type character, Oliver has been involved in several romantic storylines during his tenure; Anderson has called him \\"the hospital bike\\". In a toy boy storyline with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Oliver was seen to compromise his career. He went on to date ward sister Daisha Anderson (Rebecca Grant), kiss registrar Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), and earn the unreciprocated affection of ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori), and marry F1 doctor Tara Lo (Jing Lusi). Anderson decided to leave the series in 2012 and filmed his final scenes in March 2013. Oliver departed in the episode \\"Mens Sana In Corpore Sano\\", dated 9 July 2013. He returned on 23 December 2014, for one episode, before making a full-time return on 5 May 2015. Anderson opted to leave the series again in 2017 and Oliver departed in the episode \\"No Matter Where You Go, There You Are ‚Äì Part Two\\", broadcast on 27 March 2018. Responses to the character have generally been negative, with particular criticism for his poor treatment of Penny. Bree Treacy of RT√â Ten disliked both Valentines. Many have questioned Oliver's medical skills and labelled him an incompetent doctor ‚Äì as Daniel Maier of The Guardian put it, he is \\"a doctor with the blue eyes of Fonda and the medical competence of fondue\\". Storylines Oliver arrives at Holby City Hospital as an F1 doctor, alongside his sister Penny (Emma Catherwood). He acquires Penny's preferred rotation on the Acute Assessment Unit (AAU), where he develops a flirtatious relationship with ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley). Within weeks, their relationship becomes sexual. Chrissie becomes pregnant, but later miscarries. They break up, and Oliver moves on to date ward sister Daisha Anderson (Rebecca Grant). A transfer to the cardiothoracic surgery ward has him working under registrar Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). While Daisha spends Christmas with her family in the Philippines, Oliver kisses Jac. Upon her return, Daisha learns of the tryst. Soon thereafter, she is shot during a hostage situation and Oliver struggles to cope. Although she recovers, she opts to leave Holby and move back to the Philippines. Oliver discovers that Penny has been having a relationship with a patient, Scott (Joshua Bowman), endangering her career. She plans to move to Spain with him and abandon her training, but Oliver convinces Scott to leave without her. Keen to earn praise from his consultants, Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley), Oliver claims Penny's research as his own, and is awarded her place in an operation. He is promoted to F2 level, and betrays Penny further by revealing her affair with Scott, which results in her failing her cardiothoracic rotation and being moved to the AAU. A rivalry develops between them, but they are forced to call a truce when a series of pranks endanger a patient. Registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam) shirks his responsibilities by excessively delegating to Oliver; to his dismay, Connie appoints him as Oliver's mentor. Oliver pushes himself too far in an attempt to impress Greg, which earns the senior doctor a reprimand for leaving him unsupervised. Oliver tries to earn back Greg's respect, but panics while attempting to insert a chest drain, and has to be rescued by ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). He invites her for a drink as thanks, but when Penny discovers that Frieda has romantic feelings for him, Oliver cancels as he does not reciprocate them. Oliver's confidence is further damaged when he mishandles a case, which results in a mother leaving her son to die alone. He moves back to the AAU, where he is shaken by an encounter with the boy's mother, which causes him to panic and embarrass himself in theatre. Penny's career begins to improve, and Oliver resents her when she is given registrar duties for a shift. Having realised that he is close to failing his F2 year, Oliver implicates Penny in a serious surgical error of his own doing, but is caught by registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola). When a patient unexpectedly dies in his care, Oliver breaks down. He confesses to Penny that he cheated in medical school by swapping one of their exam papers, so he passed on her merit while she was forced to repeat a year. Furious, Penny tells Oliver that he must confess to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry). He writes a letter of resignation, but deletes it after a positive day working alongside Frieda, who encourages him to repeat his F2 year. After giving Oliver a final chance to confess, Penny is called away to the site of a train crash. Oliver is left alone on AAU, where he successfully performs a difficult procedure. Hopeful that Penny will forgive him, Oliver is devastated to learn that she has been killed in an accident at the crash site. Unable to cope in the aftermath of her death, Oliver turns to drugs and alcohol. He sends Hanssen a letter of resignation, which includes a full confession. His father Tony (Simon Shepherd) offers him money to choose a new career, and claims that Oliver always had more potential than Penny. This angers Oliver, who endangers his own life to save a patient and feels reinvigorated. Hanssen is impressed by Oliver's patient treatment, and overlooks his cheating to allow him a fresh start. Oliver continues and succeeds in his second F2 year under Elliot, who is his mentor. He begins a relationship with F1 Tara Lo (Jing Lusi). He learns she has a brain tumor and becomes fixated on finding a cure. She learns to accept it. Oliver begins spending more time at Tara's flat and later moves in. Oliver and Tara marry the day before she has a major operation.Radio Times, Holby City, Series 15, Episode 26 Oliver and Tara prepare for her operation, but there are complications in surgery and she dies.BBC.co.uk Series 15, Episode 27 Great Expectations Anderson returns as Oliver in the episode \\"I Will Honour Christmas in My Heart\\" - Series 17, Episode 11, for just one episode.

When Ollie diagnoses a stroke, Roxanna is filled with joy. Development =Creation and characterisation= The impending arrival of sibling trainee doctors Oliver and Penny was announced in May 2009, by executive producer Tony McHale and series producer Diana Kyle. The latter described them both as \\"full of energy and enthusiasm\\", and asserted that they would have an \\"instant impact on the wards at every level.\\" They were deemed talented physicians with the desire to achieve by McHale, who noted that \\"one is more naturally gifted than the other\\", and suggested that their personal lives would cause conflict with their professional ones, as they attempted to progress at work. Actor James Anderson was cast as Oliver. Before assuming the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds ‚Äì an experience he found difficult. \\"We were approaching beds in which people were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult to be there with a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional.\\" Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June 2009, \\"If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!\\" The actor experienced \\"an extended period of anxiety\\" upon joining the series, and recalls: \\"It took me about six months to have any sense of what was going on and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while.\\" BBC Online described Oliver's positive qualities as being his \\"boyishly charming\\" manner and his general determination. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror deemed him a \\"soft touch\\" when he went to great lengths to help a young patient. Oliver is flawed by a lack of confidence and his deceptive nature. He has a tendency to land his colleagues in trouble, which has been conveyed through storylines with Daisha and Greg. What's on TV highlighted Oliver's \\"lack of competence\\" and called him petulant for betraying Penny after his promotion to F2 level. When his career began to deteriorate, the publication deemed him reckless, then found him hapless in the aftermath of her death, in reference to the way he \\"[sank] into despair, finding comfort in drink, drugs and his dead sister's flatmate.\\" The Sunday Mirror Kevin O'Sullivan reflected on Oliver's development since his arrival, with the observation, \\"Once he was the strutting ladies' man of the wards, a veritable medical Casanova who exuded confidence and charm. But time has taken its toll on Oliver Valentine ‚Äì and now he is just a shadow of his former self\\" ‚Äì a devastated and broken man, \\"tormented by the memory of his sibling and his guilty conscience.\\" =Relationships= Introduced as a Lothario-type character, according to Anderson, Oliver \\"had a reputation for being the hospital bike.\\" His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, \\"I think any hot-blooded male would find that attractive\\". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis ‚Äì though Anderson noted, \\"he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake\\". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined \\"She's gorgeous, and Oliver would be a fool not to go out with her.\\" He thought that Oliver and Chrissie's \\"unflappable\\" natures made them a good fit for one another, though wondered if they were too alike. As an older woman, their relationship was described as a \\"toyboy storyline\\" for Chrissie. Hobley admitted to having fun with the storyline due to the real age gap between herself and Anderson. She described Chrissie's feelings for Oliver, stating: \\"Chrissie is having a lot of fun with him. But deep down she's really hoping to find true love ‚Äì she's been quite unlucky so far. She's not getting any younger and she's worried about missing out on kids.\\" Producers Kyle and McHale revealed that the pair could have been a \\"perfect match\\", however said the romance would not run smoothly. Anderson believed it was a bad idea for his character to get involved with a colleague. Oliver began to doubt the relationship, and on Penny's advice, convinced Chrissie to break up with him without ruining his career. Chrissie took the break up well, and Hobley told What's on TV that her character did not mind, as \\"it was only a bit of fun. She never planned on settling down with him.\\" It was then announced Chrissie would become pregnant with Oliver's child. Hobley assessed that Chrissie was surprised to learn that she was pregnant, but pleased, as she had lost a baby five years previously and did not think that she was capable of conceiving another. Oliver was displeased by the news, but Chrissie had no expectations that he should provide for her. Her father, nursing consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell), urged him to \\"stand up to the mark and be a proper man\\". However, soon after, Chrissie miscarried their unborn baby.Tina Hobley: 'Chrissie's ready for a baby'. Event occurs at 00:35. Retrieved 1 July 2011. \\"She says 'I don't want anything from you, this is my decision to have this baby, not yours, you're young, 24 years old'. And then he's panicking a bit, and her dad is making him feel really guilty about, 'You better stand up to the mark and be a proper man about this' and all this nonsense. And then, tragically, the next episode, she's not feeling very good and she has this miscarriage.\\" Oliver went on to share a kiss with Jac, a photograph of which was spread around the hospital by Penny, prompting Oliver to try and hide it from Daisha. Ward sister Frieda Petrenko developed a crush on him, and was pleased when he invited her for a drink, however Oliver did not reciprocate her feelings and later cancelled. Fedori commented in January 2011 that she and Anderson had had little \\"juicy\\" material, more \\"little scenes here and there\\". Asked about the future of Frieda and Oliver's relationship, she was unwilling to divulge potential plots, but noted, \\"There's been talk about things heading in all sorts of directions\\". Oliver initially had a \\"friendly rivalry\\" with sister Penny. Catherwood believes they always had \\"a really good relationship\\". She characterised the siblings' relationship as \\"one of constant rivalry but ultimately unconditional support\\", and noted, \\"Everything always comes more easily to Oliver than Penny ‚Äì she has spent her life playing catch up\\". When Penny considered giving her career up over a patient she was romantically involved with, in order to protect her, Oliver ruined the romance. Their relationship remained unaffected by this: Catherwood revealed, \\"Well they are brother and sister, so you forgive your family for enormous amounts. So it doesn't affect their relationship, if anything he is there as soon as she breaks down he's there to catch her, full of apologies and support.\\" She said the situation would bring them closer together, because it is a typical scenario siblings go through. When Catherwood quit the series, Penny was killed whilst attempting to rescue a patient from a train crash. Her death was not shown on-screen: a conscious decision made by the production team to fully focus on Oliver's story. Series producer Myar Craig Brown revealed that the big focus would be on the effect it had on Oliver. Forced to come to terms with her death, he faced an \\"emotional rollercoaster of feeling that he was second best to her\\". =Career= Having arrived at Holby as an F1, Oliver quickly progressed onto his F2 training. This resulted in \\"professional jealousy\\" forming with Penny, and in retaliation to their disagreements, he put her career in jeopardy by revealing her affair. Registrar Greg Douglas was appointed as Oliver's mentor. The fast-paced storyline saw Greg initially \\"kick[ing] against his newfound responsibility\\", before realising that Oliver could be beneficial to his own career, which resulted in an \\"unlikely friendship\\" forming between them. Though a \\"fairly light, buddy-buddy\\" storyline to begin with, Anderson felt that filming their scenes was \\"intensive\\". Speaking of their friendship, Anderson explained: \\"We start off on the wrong foot with each other and we're competitive, which is unhelpful to the patients and (initially) we're not out to help one another at all. But they have similarities... in terms of dropping people in it.\\" The pace of the storyline had to be changed when Anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten-foot cellar. The pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care, and their friendship soon created a negative effect over Oliver's work ethic. Greg's jokes at his expense left Oliver unable to carry out simple procedures correctly. Oliver's career further deteriorated in early 2011, when it transpired he was not a qualified doctor. A series of setbacks ‚Äì failing the exam to progress on to his CT1 training, blaming a surgical error on Penny, and the death of a patient in his care ‚Äì prompted him to admit that he swapped his own exam paper with Penny's in his final year of medical school. Anderson explained that Oliver could no longer cope with the mounting pressure, hence his confession. Contrasting the siblings, he assessed \\"[Oliver] was seen as the golden boy when he arrived at Holby ‚Äì but he was trading on his sister's success.\\" Issued with the ultimatum of confessing to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen, Oliver realised that \\"he must take responsibility\\", lest he \\"lose the one person who loves him unconditionally.\\" Believing himself to be in an \\"impossible dilemma\\", Anderson said that Oliver was trying to make good on what he had done by repeating his F2 exams. \\"By exposing the lie he'll end his career, Oliver can't understand why Penny won't stand by him.\\" He added that since Oliver made a serious surgical error, his colleagues had lost trust in his medical capability. When a train crash occurred, he was forced to take control of AAU. Anderson explained: \\"He's not fully qualified and that's all he can think about. He's struggling.\\" When he saved a patients life, Oliver thought he should keep his job. However, he was then told that Penny had died, news that would \\"change Oliver's life forever.\\" Following Penny's death, Craig- Brown stated that \\"whether he's good enough to stay in medicine will be [Oliver's] big storyline.\\" The series explored how Oliver coped with her death through a flashback episode. Henry, who plays Hanssen, observed that Oliver's return to work saw him make multiple mistakes and \\"hit rock bottom\\". Oliver tried to resign from Holby, though before he left he responded to a dangerous RTA call and saved a patient's life. When he was summoned by Hanssen about his resignation, he was given \\"fatherly advice\\", and the senior doctor \\"turned a blind eye\\" to Oliver's confession. Henry explained that Hanssen \\"doesn‚Äôt think a good doctor should lose his chance at a career in medicine\\", after learning Oliver risked his own life on the job. =Departure and return= The character left the show in the episode titled \\"Mens Sana In Corpore Sano\\", which aired on 9 July 2013. Anderson told producers of his intention to leave one year prior to his departure. They wanted Oliver to leave the show on a positive note and began planning his final storyline. Anderson filmed his final scenes in March 2013. Producers kept his departure a secret until transmission to surprise viewers. Anderson told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that Oliver survived the bereavement over the deaths of his sister and wife. Oliver was given redemption in his final scenes so that his fans could believe that he has a future. Oliver resigns and in his final scene tells Elliot that he will return to the hospital. Anderson was pleased that his character has the option of returning in the future. On 30 October 2014, it was announced that Anderson had reprised his role. Anderson expressed his pleasure at returning to Holby City saying he was \\"thrilled to be given the opportunity to bring Ollie back\\". He said there would be \\"lots of surprises in store\\" for his character, who he dubbed \\"Oliver 2.0\\" due to him being older and wiser. Anderson had been approached to return numerous times but only agreed mid 2014. Oliver's return was planned to last one episode but Anderson was persuaded to return permanently. The BBC later released a promotional video publicising the character's return. Oliver's return storyline will see him admitted to the hospital suffering from a serious heart condition. Anderson explained that in the fourteen months since his departure from Holby, Oliver has been working abroad in South America, drinking heavily and self- medicating with several drugs. As he was not taking proper care of himself, he contracted a virus which has affected his heart. Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) discovers a \\"bloodied and badly bruised\\" Oliver near the hospital entrance, and admits him immediately. When it emerges that Oliver's condition is potentially fatal, he asks Elliot to fit him with his new surgical device. However, Jac refuses to let the surgery go ahead as the device is only in the experimental stage. Anderson said \\"Oliver knows that the operation shouldn't go ahead. It's legally, ethically and morally not a procedure that he should have, but when Jac says no, he's disappointed and angry.\\" However, Elliot refuses to give up on Oliver and makes sure the operation goes ahead. =Second departure= Anderson decided to leave the series again in 2017 and Oliver departed in the twentieth series episode \\"No Matter Where You Go, There You Are ‚Äì Part Two\\", broadcast on 27 March 2018. Oliver's exit was not announced before transmission and Anderson confirmed the news on Twitter, commenting, \\"It's with a full, heavy heart that I now move on to adventures new.\\" Reception Reviewers' interpretations of Oliver have generally been negative. Early in his tenure, he received positive commentary from Inside Soap, who said, \\"he may be a whizz-kid trainee doctor, but new Holby recruit Oliver Valentine isn't all work and no play! He's certainly got an eye for the ladies.\\" Maeve Quigley, writing for the Daily Mirror, opined that Chrissie was more than a match for Oliver. She added that he soon learnt \\"you underestimate the female staff of Holby at your peril\\", after he thought his flirting had Chrissie \\"wrapped around his little finger.\\" Also writing for the Daily Mirror, Simon called Oliver and Penny a \\"medical tag-team\\". She found it odd they did not get along professionally because she thought \\"a brother-sister relationship would be one of the least troublesome at Holby.\\" A Liverpool Daily Post review said that Oliver made Penny feel about \\"two inches tall\\" when he was promoted to F2, and supported her question \\"Who needs enemies when I've got a brother like you?\\" Bree Treacy of RT√â Ten found both of the Valentines annoying. In June 2010 she preferred Penny, \\"with Oliver definitely getting the award for the most annoying sibling in the hospital\\"; the following month she called them irritating and recommended they \\"get [their] acts together\\". On the day Oliver admitted to stealing Penny's exam paper, Daily Mirror critic Jim Shelley featured him in his negative \\"Down\\" column and branded him a \\"weasel\\". Oliver's lack of medical ability drew several negative reviews. Referring to his \\"cack-handedness\\", Simon described him as \\"screwing up just about everything he touches\\" upon his return to the AAU, a sentiment she repeated after Penny's death. Simon was left baffled when a professor of cardiology was offered the \\"very best care possible\\" ‚Äì which resulted in Oliver treating him. She concluded: \\"[this] begs the question, what's he doing at Holby being looked after by an F2?\\" The Guardian Daniel Maier ridiculed Oliver's supposed talents, and jested that he was \\"a doctor with the blue eyes of Fonda and the medical competence of fondue\\". One Daily Record columnist said that Oliver \\"hoped to complete his training on the strength of his nice eyes and pretty\\". A special flashback episode, centered on Oliver dealing with the aftermath of Penny's death, was selected as recommended viewing by What's on TV, the Liverpool Daily Post, and the Daily Mirror. The Sunday Mirror O'Sullivan called it poignant, and Rachel Mainwaring of the Western Mail wrote, \\"It's easy viewing (apart from the odd gooey scene) and full of moral as well as medical issues that leaves you shouting at the screen, 'Do the right thing Oliver, tell them the truth.'\\" References External links * Oliver Valentine at BBC Online * Oliver Valentine on IMDb Category:Holby City characters Category:Fictional physicians Category:Television characters introduced in 2009 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Oliver Valentine"},{"id":"32081980","text":"Coleophora kizildashi is a moth of the family Coleophoridae which is endemic to Armenia.

He was a wealthy merchant, economist and lawyer. Johann Rudolph Tschiffeli was born in Bern in 1716, in a patrician family. He spent much of his youth in Rheineck. His father, also named Johann Rudolpf Tschiffeli (1688 - 1747), was at first the General Secretary of Canton of St. Gallen and from 1734 on the Landvogt of Bern, when the family moved to Wangen an der Aare. After the death of his parents, Tschiffeli took over the care of his four younger siblings, and of his own household. In 1755 he became clerk at the superior marriage court, which position meant a steady income. He occupied this post until his death. In 1758, Tschiffeli formed the Economic Society (\\"√ñkonomischen Gesellschaft\\"), which was influential beyond the Swiss borders. Albrecht von Haller was at one time the secretary and president of it, and in its long history it had contact with people like Carl Linnaeus, Voltaire, Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Plati√®re, Gaetano Filangieri, and Arthur Young. Members included Niklaus Emanuel Tscharner and Vincenz Bernhard Tscharner. Activities decreased around 1800, but the society was restarted in 1838 and still exists in 2011.

The large gate house into the castle was built in 1573-76 and is probably the work of Uli and Jacques Bodmer. The large coat of arms is from 1640. In 1729, the facade was whitewashed and decorated with painted decorations. The castle was given to the city in 1854 by Just Lutry Charles Antoine de Crousaz who was a descendant of the owners in 1640. Since 1942, the castle houses the municipal administration. It received an interior renovation, in 1965, during which extraordinary murals dating from the sixteenth century within the main staircase were discovered. A complete restoration of the facades and roofs was undertaken between 1985 and 1988 with which focused on keeping up authentic paints. The renovation gave the castle a look close to its original decor of 1576 and 1729.

He was involved in a host of musical ventures that included Harry was a Snake, an experimental acoustic outfit, Curry and Rice with guitarist Steve Newman, the seven-piece jazz outfit Equinoxe, Bafo Bafo with Zulu guitarist Madala Kunene,http://www.bafobafo.co.za/home.html The Aquarian Quartet with fellow aquarians Tony Cox, Steve Newman and Greg Georgiadeshttp://www.sydkitchen.com and of course his own solo career. Early life Syd was born in Durban, South Africa.http://www.rock.co.za/legends/2000plus/aquarian_live.htm At a young age he started singing in the local church. His parents ran a weekly Saturday night session at the local football club and one Saturday Syd sang with the local band called The Kittens. The crowd so loved his performance that every Saturday he would join the band to sing a few songs. In 1967 his band Parkinson's Law came second in the Durban Battle of the Bands.http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/sydney-kitchen-8631 Career In his teens Syd began performing with his brother Pete as \\"The Kitchen Brothers\\". His musical involvement with Pete lasted seven years during which they performed their own brand of acoustic folk music. They appeared at folk festivals around the country and were recorded as festival guests by David Marks' SAFMA label and in their own right by the SABC's World Service for external broadcast to North America, Europe, Japan and North Africa.http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_index.html By the late 1970s Pete Kitchen had moved on to a career outside of music, and in 1978 Syd formed jazz-rock band Equinoxe. Then in 1979 Kitchen formed the experimental acoustic outfit \\"Harry was a Snake\\".https://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=46177925364&topic;=5578 In 1980 Kitchen embarked on a solo career and began working on a number of musical revues which included his own \\"S'No Good and the Reason Why\\" and two successful Bob Dylan revues. During this time he continued writing not only songs, but also his own uniquely personal poetry and prose that had already sold more than 3000 copies when published as an anthology titled \\"Scars That Shine\\" a few years earlier.http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_index.html In 1982 Syd opened \\"Syd Kitchen's Guitar Saloon\\",http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/sydney- kitchen-8631 a guitar shop in Durban which soon became a mecca for local musicians, serving as a venue for both concerts and clinics that featured musicians from all over the country. While Syd was working in his guitar shop he focused on honing his skills across a large array of musical styles. The rapid blooming of his guitar playing was reflected in the steady stylistic growth of his writing, as he began to feed rock, country, jazz, blues and African music into his now trademark lyrical quirks and musical detours.http://mg.co.za/article/2011-03-23-sno-good-sa-bids-farewell-to-music- icon-syd-kitchen =Waiting for the Heave= Kitchen, who had meanwhile closed his guitar shop, spent the second half of the ‚Äò80s leading his band named \\"Syd Kitchen & the Utensils\\", with male backing singers known as the Kitchenettes.

The album reflected Kitchen's increasingly politicised songwriting, while living in a repressive apartheid regime.http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_index.html Due to lack of radio play and South Africa's strict international boycotts, \\"Waiting for the Heave\\" was a commercial failure.http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/article988931.ece/Syd-Kitchen --Afro-Saxon-singer-and-songwriter In the late 1980s, live performance, low key and relatively infrequent, remained the only reliable way to hear Syd Kitchen.http://kaganof.com/kagablog/2011/04/13/richard-haslop-on-syd- kitchen-2/ 1990 marked the first annual Splashy Fen, a folk festival which has become one of the most celebrated festivals on the African continent.http://www.splashyfen.co.za/ For a number of South African music fans, the enduring memory of Syd Kitchen will be his performances at Splashy Fen each year from 1990‚Äì2010.http://www.thedailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2011-03-24-rest-in- silence-syd-kitchen-the-legend Around this time David Marks, a local music veteran (who in 1968 had written \\"Master Jack\\", the first South African recorded song to reach the US Top 20), released the live album, Warts 'n All, on his Third Ear Music label in 1992. It was an honest and captivating demonstration of the attraction of a Syd Kitchen gig.http://kaganof.com/kagablog/2011/04/13/richard-haslop-on-syd-kitchen-2/ =City Child= In 1995 Kitchen released his second album entitled City Child. The creation of City Child was a lengthy process. Started in early 1988, the album went through several stop/start phases before its eventual completion. The rhythm section was recorded live in February 1988 before it went into storage for a period of years. Music was added slowly between 1991 and 1994, before finally emerging to excellent countrywide reviews in 1995. Initially recorded with a Fostex 16 track analogue machine, the album was digitally processed before being mastered in Stuttgart Germany.http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_city.html Kitchen says of City Child: \\"It was also difficult to do in so far as the subject matter I was writing about was concerned. Some of the songs had been written as early as 1975, and some while the album was being made. I was going through a seriously tough time of personal shit that all helped shape the course of the work. This introspective spin, and the quality of the (mainly jazz) musicians involved, contributed to the album‚Äôs eventual ambiance; 10 tight little quirky ‚Äújazz‚Äù tunes.\\"http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_city.html =Amakoologik= In 1999 Syd Kitchen released Amakoologik. The title itself is a parody on the many names beginning with \\"ama\\" that South African's give to their sporting teams to galvanise national support and create a feeling of racial integration.http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_amakool.html Kitchen himself said of the album title: \\"I have coined the name AMAKOOL (the cool) to signify the way we can go about life unconcerned with the guy in the gutter. We can sit eating supper and watch seemingly unaffected as CNN or the BBC delivers graphic images of Rwandan ‚Äústick people‚Äù or the like into our de-sensitized lives. Our collective apathy is the product of what I call AMAKOOLOGIK (the cool logic). My na√Øve hope is that millions will hear that word and ask themselves one central question: Aren‚Äôt you amazed that its so alive and still going on?‚Äù\\"http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_amakool.html The lyrics of the title track are perhaps one of the best examples of Kitchen's socio-political lyric writing, describing the opposite ends of the social spectrum, not just in South Africa but worldwide.http://ccs.ukzn.ac.za/files/Ballard%202002%20Desegregating%20Minds.pdf =Africa's Not for Sissies= Africa's Not for Sissies is probably the album that has earned him most plaudits. Released in 2001 on Kitchen's own No Budget Records, the album received much critical acclaim and was nominated 4th in the SA Rock Digest's Top 30 Albums of 2001.http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_index.html Africa's Not for Sissies was also acclaimed for Kitchen's intricate guitar technique.http://mg.co.za/article/2011-03-23-sno-good-sa-bids-farewell-to- music-icon-syd-kitchen Richard Haslop has commented that \\"Africa's Not for Sissies is a trenchant, if inimitably humorous and often moving reflection on his own status as a white South African committed to living in a country that so many of his compatriots were leaving.\\"http://kaganof.com/kagablog/2011/04/13/richard-haslop-on-syd- kitchen-2/ John Samson of SA Rock Digest said of the album: \\"He has struck at the very core of the new South Africa and everything it has to offer. Syd has the red dust of Africa running through his veins and a finger firmly on the pulse of a nation going through the birth pains of being born again. He is the hippest of hippies and has produced an album of extreme beauty and social awareness. This is a profound and important album, ignore it at your peril.\\"http://www.rock.co.za/files/syd_africa.html In 2004 Kitchen embarked on a successful solo tour abroad during which he performed in England, Wales, Norway and Denmark, at among others, the Glastonbury Festival in England and the Kongsberg Jazz Festival in Norway.http://mg.co.za/article/2011-03-23-sno- good-sa-bids-farewell-to-music-icon-syd-kitchen =Bafo Bafo: What Kind?= Africa's Not for Sissies was followed by the formation of Bafo Bafo. After years of friendship and informal \\"jamming\\" together at clubs and festivals, Madala Kunene and Syd Kitchen, two of South Africa's most enduring musical sons, joined forces in the creation of Bafo Bafo. This cross-cultural musical collaboration between two highly individual guitar stylists created a musical landscape that was absolutely unique, and culminated in the release of their only album together, \\"What Kind?\\". Bafo Bafo delivered a musical tapestry that was at once a living embodiment of the \\"new\\" South Africa, while their ability to naturally fuse cultural elements from the diversity abundant in multiethnic South Africa marked Bafo Bafo as a musical manifestation of the ethos behind the drive for Africa's renaissance.http://www.bafobafo.co.za =Across= 2007 saw Kitchen release what some call his finest album; Across consists of four long, solo acoustic guitar instrumentals named after the four elements, Earth, Air, Fire and Water, each of which references, if sometimes obliquely, the musical elements that have got him to this point.http://kaganof.com/kagablog/2011/04/13/richard-haslop-on-syd-kitchen-2/ =Fool in a Bubble= In 2008 Brooklyn-based documentary filmmaker Joshua Sternlicht made a feature film on Kitchen, entitled Fool in a Bubble. Fool in a Bubble is the story of South African folk singer and poet Syd Kitchen, ‚Äúas seen through the eyes of Sternlicht. Filmed in Durban and New York, the documentary premiered at the 2010 Durban International Film Festival. The film detailed Kitchen's life and music, in Durban and as he travelled to perform in New York, where he also recorded with Paul Simon's Graceland band. An album entitled \\"Fool in a Bubble\\" was released in conjunction with the film.http://foolinabubble.com/ Kitchen himself said of the film: \\" That is Josh Sternlicht's (Independent Filmmaker) take on my life. \\"http://www.onesmallseed.com/index.php/syd-kitchen-rest-in-peace-but-never- silent/ =John Martyn Tribute Album= About the last musical adventure of Kitchen‚Äôs life was travelling to Scotland to record a version of the John Martyn song, Fine Lines, along with members of Martyn's band Alan Thomson, Foster Paterson and his close friend Suzi Chunk for a Martyn tribute album that seems destined to include a string of far better known artists than Kitchen himself.http://kaganof.com/kagablog/2011/03/28/syd-kitchen- quintessentially/ The tribute album featuring his cover of John Martyn's Fine Lines is due for release in June. The album also features The Cure's Robert Smith, David Gray, Beck, Paolo Nutini and Phil Collins doing covers of Martyn's work. Martyn himself was apparently well aware of and quite taken with Kitchen‚Äôs output.http://www.johnmartyn.com/ Personal life Kitchen, who taught guitar privately for years, went to university from which he emerged with BA (Music) and BA Honours degrees in musicology, both of which were awarded cum laude.http://www.safindit.co.za/blog/?p=1345 Death In March 2011 Kitchen was diagnosed with lung cancer and died soon afterwards. At the time of his death, there were a number of benefit concerts planned, featuring many of his collaborators. Kitchen was survived by his wife, Germaine, and two daughters, Sev and Jasmine.http://www.safindit.co.za/blog/?p=1345 In an interview with City Press shortly before his death, Kitchen said: \\"I've lived life, I'm proud of my credibility and what I've done ‚Äì more than most my age.

Harrison began developing his movement style as a tumbling specialist and later as a dancer in Broadway theatre productions. In 1990, he established the performance company AntiGravity, composed of athletes, acrobats, and former Olympic competitors, with Harrison serving as director. They have been involved in various projects, including original theatrical productions, corporate events, and choreographing live performances, including the 2008 Neighborhood Inaugural Ball and the closing ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics. AntiGravity has also collaborated with musicians and pop celebrities for performances in entertainment industry shows, including the Academy Awards, the MTV Video Music Awards, and the Grammys. Harrison continues to work as an aerial designer for Broadway shows and the Metropolitan Opera. In 2007, Harrison developed and started AntiGravity Fitness, a brand of workout programs combining the silk hammocks used in AntiGravity's aerial performances with yoga practices, Pilates, ballet barre exercises, and traditional strength training techniques into different exercise curriculums. Headquartered in New York City at his development studio, Christopher Harrison's AntiGravity Lab, his programs are currently licensed in fitness centers in over 40 countries. Early career Prior to his dance and theater career, Harrison was a competitive acrobat and tumbling specialist. When he was 17 he placed fourth in power tumbling at the World Games in Honolulu. However, citing that he did not have the body to reach the top ranks in competitive acrobatics, he enrolled at the University of Utah, took up competitive cheerleading, and switched focus to dance. While 18 and still at the University of Utah, director Herbert Ross and choreographer Lynne Taylor-Corbett cast him as a featured dancer in the film Footloose after seeing him perform flips at the local drive-in. After college, Harrison moved to New York City, where he went on to appear in multiple Broadway musicals, such as Cats, Damn Yankees, Meet Me in St. Louis, West Side Story, and A Chorus Line. Harrison choreographed his first performance for the closing ceremonies celebration of the New York Marathon at the Roseland Ballroom. His group of acrobats were credited as \\"ZeroGravity,\\" though Harrison changed the name to \\"AntiGravity\\" when they performed an annual feature in the Easter Show at the Radio City Music Hall. He directed his first full-length acrobatic show for Club Med Resorts in 1991. For six years, the interdependence he established with the international resort company allowed his performers to attain access to rehearsal space, where he continued to develop the troupe's acrobatic style. Theater =Metropolitan Opera= Harrison has had a long- standing relationship with the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. In 1992 he led the Opera's first in-house acrobatic troupe in 14 stage appearances, and in the following year, Harrison created acrobatic staging in a production of Berlioz's Les Troyens. From 1995 to 1996, Harrison created staging for Un Ballo in Maschera, La Traviata, Salome, Turandot, and Pagliacci. In 1997, Harrison added acrobatic acts to Ariadne auf Naxos and La Damnation de Faust. During that time Harrison collaborated with many of the MET's notable figures, including Hal Prince and Franco Zeffirelli. Since 1998, Harrison has consulted on acrobatic and aerial performances in multiple opera productions, including Aida, Samson et Delilah, and Manon. =Aerial choreography= Christopher Harrison has provided aerial choreography for multiple Broadway and theater productions, including the 1997 revival of Leonard Bernstein's Candide. In the original production of Swing!, which opened in December 1999, Harrison was credited for providing the show's \\"aerial flying\\" elements. Harrison also designed the aerial act for Jane Krakowski in the revival of Nine, for which he shared a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. In 1992, Harrison appeared with AntiGravity alongside Marisa Tomei in The Comedy of Errors at the Delacorte Theater for Shakespeare in the Park. In the original production of Stephen Sondheim's The Frogs, Harrison collaborated with director Susan Stroman on aerial design and created an aerial bungee number for Nathan Lane. Television appearances Christopher Harrison first appeared on television with AntiGravity during the 1991 Miss America Pageant in a segment called \\"Extreme Dance\\" by choreographer Scott Salmon. In the same year, Harrison choreographed a segment for the NBA All-Star Game half-time show, as well as a television special \\"NBA All-Star Stay in School Jam\\" with MC Hammer. In addition to live performances, Harrison also choreographed television commercials for multiple companies, including BF Goodrich, Samsung, and branding agency Big Blue Dot. 1n 2002, Harrison and AntiGravity were featured on Fox's Good Day New York newscast, as well as ABC's Good Morning America. This was followed by a debut of the company on NBC's Today Show in 2003. =Awards shows= Harrison collaborated as choreographer with rapper/producer P. Diddy and rapper Busta Rhymes in a number featuring Usher and Pharrell for the 2002 MTV Video Awards. In 2003, Harrison also worked with the music group No Doubt in a feature song presentation during the 45th Annual Grammy Awards, as well as working with Michael Jackson during the 2003 Radio Music Awards. For the BET Awards in 2007 and 2008 he choreographed performances featuring Nelly, Fergie, and 50 Cent. In 2008, Harrison choreographed a Best Original Song performance for the 80th Academy Awards, based on choreography he directed for the 2007 film Enchanted. AntiGravity, Inc On November 3, 1990, Christopher Harrison founded AntiGravity, Inc when organizers from the New York Marathon hired him to choreograph a performance for the Marathon's closing ceremonies at the Roseland Ballroom. Initially credited as \\"ZeroGravity,\\" the performance troupe comprised athletes, acrobats, and former Olympic competitors, with Harrison serving as director and choreographer. Later in 1991, Harrison changed the name to \\"AntiGravity\\" when they performed a feature for the Radio City Music Hall annual Easter Show. They have since performed in over 500 productions and live performances http://broadwayworld.com/article/AntiGravity_To_Perform_at_Obamas_Neighborhood_Inaugural_Ball_in_Washington_DC_20010101 in over 25 countries, with teams in New York City, Las Vegas, Orlando, Toronto, and Ontario. AntiGravity Fitness AntiGravity Aerial Yoga In 2007, Harrison launched a fitness technique called AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, which he then licensed to various fitness centers, including Virgin Active Fitness in Milan, Steve Nash Fitness World in Vancouver, British Columbia, Madonna's Hard Candy Fitness in Moscow, and Crunch Fitness gyms throughout the US. Since the launch of the initial technique, Harrison has combined yoga practices, Pilates, ballet barre exercises, and strength training techniques into multiple exercise curriculums under the brand AntiGravity Fitness. Personal life Harrison's personal struggle with the tenets of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints pertaining to homosexuality, greatly influenced his outlook on life. Harrison's approach to athleticism, a fascination with flight, and an attitude against graveness called \\"Be AIRful\\" culminates in an overall outlook he calls the AntiGravity philosophy.

Shannon (1821 in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania - April 13, 1899 in San Diego, California) was an American lawyer, politician, and judge. After practicing law for a time in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1852, Shannon ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the US House of Representatives (as a Democrat), losing by five hundred votes to Whig David Ritchie.The political register and congressional directory: a statistical record of the federal officials, legislative, executive, and judicial, of the United States of America, 1776‚Äì1878, Boston, 1878, p. 598 Shannon was then appointed president judge of the local district court in 1852 by Pennsylvania Governor William Bigler, but served for only a year, having been defeated for re-election in 1853. At the beginning of the Civil War Shannon became a Republican and was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serving two terms, 1862 and 1863.Members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly: Harold Cox, Wilkes University He was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel in a regiment which he helped raise, but resigned to continue his political career. In 1862 he campaigned with Governor Andrew Curtin in his successful re-election bid, and in 1864 was part of Lincoln's re-election campaign in Pennsylvania.San Diego Union, April 21, 1899, obituary, page 3 (transcribed here) After the Civil War Shannon continued his law practice until he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Dakota Territory in 1873 by President Ulysses S. Grant. Shannon presided over the trial of Jack McCall for the killing of Wild Bill Hickok which resulted in the Dakota Territory's first legal hanging, and prepared the Criminal Code adopted by the Territorial Legislature in 1875. He was reappointed by President Rutherford B. Hayes, but his application for a third appointment was opposed by the Yankton Bar Association, perhaps in part because he was viewed as a supporter of Governor Nehemiah Ordway.History of Dakota Territory, Volume 2, George Washington Kingsbury, Chicago, 1915, p. 1182 President Chester A. Arthur appointed him to a commission negotiating land sales with the Sioux, which he served on for a number of years. He signed an 1882 agreement with the Lakota which was never ratified. In 1883 Shannon was appointed to investigate charges of drunkenness and improper behavior against Everton Conger, a judge in Montana Territory; although his report was somewhat sympathetic, it led to Attorney-General Benjamin H. Brewster recommending his removal. Conger was ultimately restored to office by President Arthur, but only one day before the expiration of his commission.Miscellaneous Documents of the House of Representatives, 48th Congress, Government Printing Office, 1884, p. 776 Shannon testified before a Congressional committee about his investigation in March 1884. Shannon moved to California only a year or two before his death, due to ill health, and died after being injured in a carriage accident. Shannon County, South Dakota was named in his honor until May 1, 2015 when it was renamed Oglala Lakota County.

Education Charles E. Kirk graduated from the St. Charles Preparatory School in Columbus, Ohio in 1989 and from Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa in 1993 with a joint major in philosophy and political science. He received certification for private investigation from Georgia Piedmont Technical College in 1994, and a juris doctorate degree from Hamline Law School in 1999, where he was managing editor for the Hamline Law Review. Career After graduating from college, Kirk began part-time trading in 1993. From 1994 to 1996 he was employed as a private investigator for a law firm in Atlanta, Georgia. The same year he graduated from law school, 1999, his father died. On his deathbed, his father advised Kirk that if he does what he loves to do, success will follow. Instead of practicing law, Kirk turned to the stock market. He began trading stocks for his own account full- time.Miller, Jeff. \\"TURNING THE TABLES ON CHARLES KIRK\\", A Dash of Insight, 30 October 2010.Miller, Jeff. \\"TURNING THE TABLES ON CHARLES KIRK\\" , A Dash of Insight, 30 October 2010.

He traded both stocks and ETFs (day and swing trades) using proprietary tools he had developed. A combination of hard work and unusual performance garnered quick and widespread recognition. Over the years, he continually made changes to its content to help educate his readers and give them the tools to help their performance. As he fine-tuned his format, Kirk made sure to include what he enjoyed most, mentoring aspiring traders.Hoffman, Damien. \\"Exclusive Interview: Charles Kirk from The Kirk Report\\" , The Cheatsheet, 30 December 2009. The Kirk Report In the years 2003-2006, Kirk posted on his site information about stocks, trading, investing and the stock market with the emphasis on teaching rather than recommending stocks. He wanted to create an educational environment that fostered individual trader development rather than guru following. He wanted his readers to learn by doing it themselves, just as he had done. His mission was to teach traders and investors to make informed unemotional decisions and to shorten the learning curve it takes to be successful. Word of Kirk's track record and his blog spread quickly. The Kirk Report received favorable exposure in The Wall Street Journal (2007),Hogan, Mike. \\"The Best of Financial Bloggery: A bevy of financial blogs\\", The Wall Street Journal, 12 November 2007.

In 2006, the widely followed investment publication, Barron's, sent a reporter out to Kirk's home in Hugo, Minnesota to do a feature profile. The article reported Kirk had never had a down year as a stock trader, and in a sweeping bear market he showed substantial gains, and that 4 out of every 5 trades were successful. The article caused Kirk's readership to explode. Traders and non- traders flocked to his website (Kirk says he received over 26,000 emails) wanting to know what stocks he was buying. Kirk explained, \\"After the Barron's interview, I became famous throughout the world for The Kirk Report.\\" Kirk was unprepared for the overnight deluge, many of whom were unwanted \\"seekers of short cuts, easy answers and get-rich-quick methods\\". It put strains on his resources and on himself, personally. Trading in a fishbowl, he felt continuous pressure to have to prove himself. The process of having to perform, and, at the same time, servicing the needs of his burgeoning daily readership, caused a near nervous breakdown. It was clear that major changes were needed in his method of operation to relieve the stress. The \\"Barron's Curse\\" was taking a toll not only on his health but also on his market performance. In the years that followed, Kirk has actively changed The Kirk Report in many ways with focus on education rather than providing personal advice or trading/investment recommendations. It is his view that what investors and traders most need to succeed in the markets is to have the knowledge, experience and skill sets so they can create and maintain their own personal strategies, rather than copy any other person including his own. Mentoring Kirk's passion is to help students who want to improve their trading skills. He says, \\"The very best experience I have had in my career comes from mentoring other traders. There is nothing quite like knowing that you have helped another trader achieve some major lifetime financial goal (like paying for their children's college) because of something you did or said that was helpful.\\"Rainitz, Marko. \\"Beating the Market Every Single Year\\" , Traders' Magazine, March 2012. Kirk's fervor is rooted in his desire to give back for the help he received when he needed it. \\"I was fortunate that early in my career I had a mentor who took me under his wing and showed me everything he knew. I now do The Kirk Report in order to pass my experiences and skills to others so they can also benefit as I did from my own mentor.\\" When he initiated a mentorship program in 2009, he realized his long-term vision of helping others take their own trading strategies and skills to the next level. The rapid growth and success of his mentorship program has led to Kirk's reputation as an industry leader in advancing trader development. Kirk plans to continue to expand and develop his mentorship group and has expanded his devotion to the mentorship group after his retirement from full-time trading in 2014. Investment strategy By far the most important part of trading successfully, according to Kirk, is the management of risk. \\"When a trade moves against me, I focus on losing as little as possible. A friend of mine made millions each year even though he was correct only some 40% of the time. Why? Because he knew how to manage risk.\\"Kirk, Charles. \\"Trading Basics\\" \\"kirkreport.com\\" 5 February 2013 Kirk minimizes his risk by proper allocation, position sizing and consistent use of stop-loss orders. He has previously quoted Stanley Druckenmiller, \\"It's not whether you're right or wrong that matters but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong. Kirk described his strategy as a swing/position trader. In a January, 2013 interview with Traders On-line Magazine,Chignell, Richard. \\"Exclusive Interview: Charles Kirk from The Kirk Report\\", Traders, January 2013. he says he uses both technicals and fundamentals. \\"Technicals are used to determine entry, exit and evaluation or risk/reward potential, while fundamentals are used, through screening, to help identify high value prospects.\\" He is a big proponent of stock screens (he calls himself a \\"self- confessed stock screen addict\\") as a means of identifying stocks that have minimum downside risk and overwhelming upside potential. He uses popular screens that have proved useful but then customizes them with his own innovations. He utilizes his own proprietary screening software to monitor for actionable trading setups and patiently waits for low risk, high reward entry points and will stay out of the market until he finds one.Power, Ben. \\"Charles Kirk: From Private Investigator to Full-Time Trader\\" , Your Trading Edge Magazine, May/June, 2009. In discussing the outlook for the market, Kirk's priority is always on the price action of the market itself, not what he or others think that price action should be. He says, \\"My goal is simply to make money, not to prove to others how smart I am.\\" The biggest mistakes that traders make, he claims, are trading too frequently and too aggressively without proper risk management, i.e. without using stops and position sizing. Kirk is not a big user of \\"indicators\\". He says, \\"The best indicator is the price action of the stock itself and the patterns that develop from it, remembering to use a consistent stop loss system.\\" Kirk tells traders to learn how to use their emotions, i.e. use fear to be aggressive and exuberance to be cautious. Kirk says his own Achilles heel is that he tends to be too risk averse. Kirk is brutally honest with his readers about how extremely difficult it is to be a successful full-time trader. He says it takes a tremendous amount of time, hard work, determination, persistence, self-motivation, and skill. In addition, he says, traders must learn to control their emotions, they must enjoy research and statistics, they must have had prior success in \\"paper\\" trading and part-time trading, they must have strong family support and they must be willing to live frugally (early in their marriage, Charles and Rachel made a commitment to live below their means, to be debt free, to save and invest for their retirement). \\"You'll need initial trading capital, three years of savings to live on separate from your trading capital, and you must be debt-free. For every person who trades full time for a living, there are probably 20 or more that can't make it. As a profession, it's suitable for only a few.\\"Penn, David. \\"Charles Kirk: Want to Trade For a Living?\\", TradingMarkets.com, 16 February 2010.Penn, David. \\"Living The Dream: Trading Stocks with Charles Kirk of The Kirk Report\\", TradingMarkets.com, 1 May 2009. Kirk feels strongly that over 90% of investors/traders, including his own subscribers, would be better off adopting passive strategies such as \\"lazy portfolios\\", which are not actively managed and relieve the investor of almost all decision-making (thus the term \\"passive\\" rather than \\"active\\"). Says Kirk, \\"The only thing the 90% plus have to learn is passive portfolio management, i.e. how to match the market's overall performance.\\" Kirk has employed some passive vehicles in his own long-term, retirement portfolio, managed by his wife. However, the money in his long-term portfolio comes mostly from his very \\"active\\" short-term trading. Performance At this time, it is not possible to verify Mr. Kirk's performance in the market. While it is believed by many of his followers that he has been successful, no independently audited returns or track record are available to verify that performance. When visitors to The Kirk Report request performance stats, they are informed that he is not a trading advisor or broker and does not provide investment advice. Therefore, no track record has been maintained to provide upon visitor request. During an interview with Barron's magazine in 2006, Mr. Kirk reported his previous six years of trading results where each year showed he significantly outperformed the S&P; 500. Personal life Charles Kirk was raised in Columbus, Ohio, the only child of Betty and Charles Kirk. His father, an executive for a shoe company and a strong positive influence, died from diabetes at 57. Charles married his college sweetheart, Rachel, who he calls \\"my most trusted advisor\\". They lived in Atlanta where Charles worked as a private investigator, and then in St. Paul, Minnesota where he graduated law school. They moved nearby to Hugo, Minnesota and Charles set up shop in his home to trade stocks full-time rather than practice law. In 2008, the couple moved to a small college town, Cedar City in Utah because Rachel was offered a position as a Professor of Spanish at Southern Utah University. In 2014, Charles retired from full-time active trading and moved he and his wife to the island of Kauai, in the state of Hawaii. To the present day, he now devotes his time to mentoring and producing The Kirk Report while trading and investing on a part-time basis.Miller, Jeff. \\"Weighing the Week Ahead\\", A Dash of Insight, 17 August 2014. It was not too many years into Kirk's full-time trading life that certain traits emerged. He had a natural \\"feel\\" for trading stocks‚Äîover and above what can be learned from books. He was tenacious about constantly striving to improve both his skills and his web site, working tirelessly to do both, at the risk of his personal health. He put into practice what his father had taught him: \\"never accept mediocrity\\". To help his subscribers become the best traders possible, he exposed them to thinking and strategies different than his own. He conducted monthly Q&A; sessions with the best known traders in the business. Instead of focusing on his own successes, Kirk exposed and praised his competition. He wanted his readers to know what worked for others. He retired from full-time active trading in and moved to Hawaii in 2014. Kirk believes traders will increase their performance and extend their time on earth if they lead a balanced life i.e., they should have activities away from the trading desk. Kirk is an avid, near scratch golfer and tries to play twice a week. Playing since he was 16, he calls golf \\"life's best game\\". He quotes Bob Hope, \\"If you think golf is relaxing, you're not playing it right,\\" and says the same can be said of trading.Kirk, Charles. ‚ÄúHow Trading is Like Playing Golf‚Äù , Money Show, 15 April 2013. Kirk is an outdoor enthusiast and likes hiking, biking, body surfing, riding ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) and gardening. He is fond of watching movies, playing card games, and is an avid reader. Music is especially important. He says, \\"Encouraged by my parents, music has always been a huge part of my life. I often use music to elevate my energy levels so I can perform at my best.\\" Kirk enjoys traveling with his wife. The Kirks were married on 7/2/1993; they have no children. Underlying all his activities is Kirk's desire to help others which he does, not only through his work, but also through volunteerism and charity. He is an active philanthropist.

Directed by Don Argott and Demian Fenton, the film had its world premiere at the South by Southwest film festival on , 2011. It is distributed by Sundance Selects. Synopsis Last Days Here follows Bobby Liebling, lead singer of Pentagram, an Alexandria, Virginia-based heavy metal group founded in 1971 and active sporadically throughout the following four decades. At the film's outset, Liebling is in his 50s, living in his parents' basement, and addicted to drugs. After Pentagram's music is rediscovered by the heavy metal underground scene, Liebling begins to recover from his lifestyle. His friend and manager Sean \\"Pellet\\" Pelletier attempts to help Liebling overcome his drug addiction and escape his old life. The film ends in 2010 with Liebling and Pentagram returning to the stage and Liebling sober, married and his new wife expecting their first child. Production Co-director Fenton first became familiar with Liebling after listening to Pentagram's 1970s recordings on cassette tape and the 2001 compilation First Daze Here, and enjoying the early Pentagram material. He heard rumors about Liebling, including living in his parents' basement and ingesting illegal drugs. When Fenton and Argott began filming Liebling, they were not sure if a documentary could result. Fenton said, \\"It really seemed like he was going to smoke himself to death in his parents' basement, something we weren't interested in documenting.\\" When Liebling attempted to recover from his lifestyle, the directors saw potential for a documentary. The directors filmed hundreds of hours of footage over three years with very little budgeting. Fenton said about addressing the swift changes in Liebling's life, \\"Many times we had to finesse the rapid shifts in Bobby‚Äôs life so the viewer wouldn‚Äôt be left confused.\\" He said that Liebling had shown multiple sides of himself, which the directors tried to balance for their documentary. Release Last Days Here premiered at South by Southwest on , 2011. In the following month, Sundance Selects acquired the rights to distribute Last Days Here in North America. It distributed the documentary in theaters and through its video on demand platform. It was released commercially on July 31, 2012 in DVD format. Reception Stephen Saito of Independent Film Channel said Liebling's story was typical of most rock star stories and that his story would normally not be interesting to mainstream viewers since Pentagram never had a mass audience. Saito said, \\"Yet Fenton... and Argott spent six years waiting for the story to reveal itself and that patience has been rewarded with a tale that's sad, sometimes frustrating and ultimately triumphant.\\" The critic applauded Fenton and Argott's use of supporting characters to share stories about Liebling.

Biography  Raised in France from 1964, he joined the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1981, philosophy section. In 1983, during a music scholarship, he lived in New York at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University. At the expiration of his scholarship six months later, he decided to settle permanently in New York. With the encouragement and advice of his elders, he performed in town and joined the trumpeter Eddie Henderson's regular band. =Music career= In 1987, he recorded the first of a series of four albums for Ida Records Off the Boat with Eddie Henderson, Ralph Moore, backed by Ira Coleman on bass and Billy Hart on drums. In 1989, Odd and Blue was released with Coleman and Jack DeJohnette (drums), followed in 1990 by Colors of Manhattan, with Coleman, Henderson and Lewis Nash. De Wilde then returned to Paris to settle but came back to New York in 1992 to record a trio album, Open Changes, with Coleman and Billy Drummond (drums). The success of this record in 1993 earned him the Django Reinhardt Prize, awarded to the best musician of the year. He now shares his time between Paris and his career in New York as a leader or sideman with Barney Wilen, Aldo Romano and Andr√© Ceccarelli. In 1995, de Wilde signed with Sony Jazz (Columbia) and recorded The Back Burner. In 1996, he published Monk (L'Arpenteur/Gallimard), a biography of Thelonious Monk on which he had worked a long time. The book was an immediate success, and joined the permanent Folio catalog in October 1997. It was awarded the Charles Delaunay Prize in 1996 as \\"the best book about jazz\\" and the Pelleas Award. Monk has been translated and published in New York, London, Tokyo, Barcelona and Milan. In 1997, de Wilde released his album in trio-quartet for Columbia. Spoon-a-Rhythm earned him an award at the Victoires de la Musique in 1998 as \\"jazz artist of the year\\". His trio toured intensively in Europe, the United States and Japan for over two years. De Wilde decided then to focus on the electronic revolution that radically redefined contemporary jazz. He joined the group of Ernest Ranglin, true founding father of Jamaican reggae and met with different music movers such as Samia, Cosmik Connection or Roudoudou. The result was an album that claimed for a mutation in jazz: Time for Change was released for Warner Jazz in 2000. The band (Flavio Boltro, Ga√´l Horellou, Minino Garay, Jules Bikoko and St√©phane Huchard) gave more than a hundred concerts in France and abroad. Enriched by this experience, de Wilde went into studio again. In 2002 he recorded Stories for Warner, released in spring 2003. His new group with DJ Ben on turntables and Julien Charlet on drums toured throughout 2003-2004. During the same period, de Wilde wrote music for children's programs on France 3 TV and has composed scores for several feature films for television on TF1 and France 2. In fall 2004 de Wilde composed and recorded with his new band, Organics. The album was released by Nocturne. This group featured Ga√´l Horellou on sax and computer, Philippe Bussonnet on bass and Yoann Serra on drums. That same year, de Wilde pursued his collaborations with Andr√© Ceccarelli, Eddie Henderson (Echoes) and Rick Margitza. In February 2006, de Wilde decided to return to the acoustic trio, and invited Laurent Robin (drums) and Darryl Hall (bass) to take a break from those electronics years. The result is an album rich in rhythms, The Present (Nocturne). The same year, de Wilde met a slam artist whose album had just been out and was looking for a jazz pianist to take the band on the road. Impressed by the quality of the project, de Wilde agreed and it was the beginning of the magnificent ascension of Abd al Malik who would soon be recognized as the new figure of slam. The band toured for two and a half years and has performed in more than 160 major halls around the world. Between tours, de Wilde took the time to compare the two worlds he lived in for twenty years, and recorded the encounter of an acoustic piano and a computer. As a duet with the participation of Otisto 23, de Wilde produces sounds from his piano (with or without the keyboard) that Otisto records in real time before looping and processing them, building the musical form as it unfolds. The album, released in September 2007 (Nocturne), called PC Pieces, takes the form of a small book in which de Wilde describes the long road leading to this object. Inside the CD, a dual disc offers the music on one side and video on the other: videos synchronized to the music and a filmed concert. In 2010, the project extended into a second volume, entitled FLY! enriched by the experience of touring and playing with this group for two years. The relationship between the computer and the piano is purified, the music is more instinctive, more emotional and more rhythmic. Added to the group is videographer Nico Ticot (XLR Project), a true magician of colours and volumes, matches the music with dreamlike precision. De Wilde has produced and toured with the Diane Tell Boris Vian Project (Docteur Boris & Mister Vian, Celluloid, 2009) and has produced four volumes of tales from Africa with Souleymane Mbodj editions for Milan. He has also published short stories (Jazz Me Blue, 2009, Au Duc des Lombards, 2010) and participated in the making of a broadcast program for Arte around Thelonious Monk and the book he has written about him.

IMO partners with various health care organizations, medical content providers and EHR developers. Founded in 1994, IMO is based in Rosemont, Illinois. IMO's clinical interface terminology, which helps to map diagnostic terminologies to medical concepts and billing codes, was launched in 1995. Products such as Problem (IT) and Procedure (IT) aim to help physicians more easily choose the correct medical term for their cases, which then aids in finding the correct billing code. This allows the clinician to capture the patient condition more accurately, with more familiar terms and without slowing the EHR workflow. These products' medical vocabularies are regularly updated so as to be mapped with standardized vocabularies such as ICD and SNOMED, as well as to adhere to the October 1, 2013/2014 date of compliance for migrating to ICD-10. Each IMO term within the clinical interface terminology is in turn mapped to the appropriate administrative code set. This allows the evolution of code sets to go on and minimize the impact on the clinician; as code sets/rules change, all re-mappings are handled by IMO, enabling the clinicians to continue leveraging the same vernacular. IMO works with companies such as MEDITECH, Allscripts, Cerner and Epic Systems, providing vocabularies for the companies' health care software applications to be used by various hospitals and physicians in those companies' client networks. IMO's products and vocabularies are thus used in sites across the United States. In 2012, IMO opened a research and development office on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign to be staffed by student interns from the university. In February 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article that demonstrates how IMO's interface terminology was found to accurately categorize coronary heart disease and heart failure events. IMO's terminology service was found to be 32‚Äì42% more accurate compared to algorithms using reimbursement coding and classification techniques. Later in 2013, IMO opened up a research-and- development office in the Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign.

Five episodes were broadcast. The five episodes also appeared on the BBC, where the deletion of commercial breaks gave the show an even more rapid-fire look. The title is taken from a 1950s prank where \\"no soap radio\\" is given as a non-sequitur punchline to a joke.TV Guide: No Soap, Radio episodes. Accessed 20 April 2013 Plot Overall, the plots of No Soap, Radio were very loosely wound and often nonsensical, as with one episode's subplot involving a sentient, man-eating chair. Continuity and plausibility were usually cheerfully ignored, and what continuing story there was in any given episode often centered around the staff at Atlantic City, New Jersey's Pelican Hotel, a former \\"showplace\\" that was now somewhat faded. Seen most frequently were Roger, the young, optimistic but sometimes overwhelmed owner/manager; Karen, his sunny, capable assistant (replacing Sharon, who only appeared in the pilot); and Tuttle, the villainous house detective who was desperate to have Roger sell the hotel. There were also several residents of the hotel who were featured, including the ebullient Mr. Plitzky, the determinedly perky Marion, and chronic complainer Mrs. Belmont. Somewhat inspired by Monty Python's Flying Circus, each episode of No Soap, Radio was filled with sight gags, blackouts, and non-sequiturs. The show would frequently cut away to \\"Special Reports\\" right in the middle of a scene, with a fictitious news anchor detailing an improbable story. At other times, characters would watch a television commercial that would suddenly become the focus of a scene. Still other times, doors within the hotel might be opened to reveal any sort of environment from a business to a national park, and entire scenes would play out in these \\"hotel rooms\\" with no seeming connection to the main plot.

The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 27, 2011. The episode was written by Kit Boss and directed by Wes Archer. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed by 4.65 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by David Herman, Andy Kindler, Larry Murphy and Brian Posehn. Plot As the episode begins Bob and Louise are about to start playing \\"Burn Unit\\", a game they play at night where they flip through the channels and make sarcastic comments about what is on television. During the course of this game, Bob stumbles across his favorite movie, a spaghetti Western called \\"Banjo\\", and calls a halt to the game. Gene comes through the living room carrying a plunger, apparently having clogged the toilet, and becomes entranced with the film as well. He joins his father and sister on the couch, which does not sit well with Louise as she feels Gene is encroaching on her special time with Bob. The next morning at breakfast, Linda receives a call from Wagstaff School's counselor, Mr. Frond, about providing food for the school's upcoming conflict resolution fundraising dinner where Tina is to perform in a skit. She volunteers Bob's services to cook spaghetti and meatballs, which Bob does not appreciate for three reasons. One, the gig is unpaid. Two, he does not like Mr. Frond, referring to him as a \\"tall drink of annoying\\". Lastly, he suspects the only reason Linda wanted the responsibility was so she can one-up one of her PTA rivals, Colleen Caviello, who made baked ziti for the same fundraiser the previous year that everybody enjoyed. He eventually agrees, but vows to \\"half-ass\\" it. Gene arrives in the kitchen with Louise's \\"Little Princess\\" toy guitar. When asked why, Gene reveals that \\"Banjo\\" has inspired him to take on \\"Choo-Choo\\" (Brian Posehn), a classmate who destroys Gene's joke-cracking by blurting the punchlines before Gene can. So, at lunch that day, Gene waits for Choo-Choo to sit down before confronting him. Each time Choo-Choo tries to finish Gene's joke, Gene hits a button on the guitar to interrupt him. Gene then says the punchline and tells Choo-Choo not to do it again, although Choo-Choo is more annoyed than anything. Louise, meanwhile, is left alone because Gene usually eats his lunch with her and they play a game called \\"Food Court\\". After school, an excited Gene tells everyone at Bob's Burgers about what he did at lunch. Louise decides to see if Bob wants to play Burn Unit that evening, which includes a Spanish-language airing of Beetlejuice. Bob instead shows Louise a major purchase he made that day: a DVD box set of all of the \\"Banjo\\" films. Louise, out of frustration, begins stabbing at the DVDs with a fork, causing Bob to pull them away. She is left to try to bond with Tina, whom she finds dull and boring, and Linda, who gives her a makeover she does not want. The next day, Mr. Frond is demonstrating to the conflict resolution group a process he calls ABS (pronounced as written), which is an acronym for a three step conflict resolution (Access your feelings, Be apologetic, and Slap it!). Tina, Jimmy Pesto Jr. and classmate Jocelyn rehearse their skit, but after class Tina threatens Jocelyn that if she actually does \\"for real\\" what she does in the skit, Tina will punch her in the face repeatedly. At lunchtime, Gene keeps acting like Banjo to Choo-Choo, who still finds Gene's game more annoying than threatening. Louise's frustrations finally boil over and she confronts Gene about how he has been acting. This sets off a giant food fight and Bob is called to the school by Mr. Frond to deal with Gene and Louise. Frond sees this as a perfect opportunity to demonstrate ABS in person, but neither Gene nor Louise is particularly receptive and Bob mocks Frond for his methods failing. After losing control of the situation, which includes Frond and Bob getting physical with each other, a frustrated Frond finally hands down punishment for everyone involved. Gene and Louise are sentenced to detention after school, and Frond cancels the spaghetti dinner portion of the fundraiser. Linda is furious when she finds out all the specifics. She told Bob she had to call in several favors (two, to be exact) to get the job and to punish everyone involved she was taking the \\"Banjo\\" box set and locking it in her jewelry drawer. Tina, meanwhile, is greatly upset to the point where she cannot do her job downstairs in the restaurant, so she locks up for the day not realizing customers were still inside. At detention the next day, Louise continues to egg on both Gene and Choo-Choo, who also was given detention and is furious that Gene ruined his \\"perfect record\\" by getting him in trouble. After detention lets out, Choo-Choo decides to physically fight Gene. Bob arrives to pick Gene and Louise up just in time to see this and grabs Choo-Choo to stop him from attacking Gene, but Choo-Choo's dad arrives seconds later and accuses Bob of trying to harm his son. Bob, Louise, and Gene take off for safety, with Choo-Choo and his dad in pursuit. The Belchers take refuge inside a spiral slide where they cannot be spotted. Louise again causes trouble when she makes Bob and Gene believe she hears someone coming, but Bob reaches his breaking point with his daughter and tells her to apologize for getting Gene in trouble. Louise counters by saying she only did what she did because Bob and Gene stopped hanging out with her, and since she bonded better with the two of them than she did with Linda and Tina, she felt alone and sad. Bob then apologizes to Louise for making her feel left out the way he has and then the three decide that they also need to make things up to Linda and Tina for getting the spaghetti dinner cancelled. At the fundraiser, Linda is forced to sit and stew while Colleen Caviello continues to brag about last year's dinner. Tina goes up on stage to announce the fundraiser's money take, but catches Jocelyn whispering something to Jimmy Jr.; thinking Jocelyn is gossiping about her, Tina screams, \\"I warned you, skank\\" and attacks Jocelyn. While the two fight Colleen cannot resist taking another swipe at Linda, who finally snaps and tells Colleen she and everyone else knows that she used store-bought spaghetti sauce in her baked ziti. This creates another fight, which turns the fundraiser into a free-for-all. Just then, Bob and the kids show up with a serving cart full of spaghetti and meatballs. Mr. Frond tells Bob to leave, but Bob is willing to work on his ABS to try to defuse the situation. Frond agrees, if for nothing else but to calm down the heated crowd. Bob even offers spaghetti and meatballs to Choo-Choo and his dad when they show up a few moments later as a peace offering and everything seems to be just fine...until Louise once again starts a food fight. Reception In its original American broadcasting, \\"Spaghetti Western and Meatballs\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.65 million viewers and received a 2.2 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, an increase from last episode. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, saying \\"While the comedy level of the episode isn't quite as impressive as last week's parade of anuses, ‚ÄúSpaghetti Western And Meatballs‚Äù does manage to include a constant stream of jokes, like both other new episodes this week. Probably the best comes primarily from Bob's Burgers' somewhat underrated animation department, when Linda flashes back to last year's school fundraiser and the terror of slow-motion mothers complimenting a rival with their mouths full. It is utterly absurd, and it lasts long enough that it threatens to move into Family Guy-esque anti-humor, but it's built up and delivered brilliantly and is probably my favorite single bit of the night.\\" References  External links  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 1) episodes ","title":"Spaghetti Western and Meatballs"},{"id":"32083069","text":"Elizabeth Wilhide is a prolific writer of books on design and decoration.Google Books In a New York Times review of 1995, Michael Owens describes her \\"fully researched\\" book The Mackintosh Style: Design and Decor as \\"a keeper\\".New York Times ReviewNew York Times Her book Scandinavian Modern Home was Book of the Week at the Evening Standard in September 2008.

At each of the roadbed changes in Williamsburg, Broadway bends a little more to the south until it runs straight southeast to East New York. The Broadway Ferry provided service (from the early 19th century) from the foot of Broadway to several points in Manhattan and by the mid-1860s was carrying over 200,000 passengers per day.

Thirty-five blocks of Broadway from Williamsburg to Bedford-Stuyvesant were destroyed, 134 stores looted, 45 of them set ablaze. The riots accelerated white flight from the area, as many of the destroyed properties were never rebuilt and remained empty lots well until the 1980s. Broadway remained a high-crime, destitute area until gentrification in the 2000s which has initiated a resurgence of new businesses, construction of luxury condominiums, and a return of chain stores to the area.

The casus belli for the invasion was the murder of Cao Cao's father, Cao Song, in Xu Province. Although Tao Qian's culpability was questionable, Cao Cao nonetheless held him responsible. The invasion took place in two separate waves in 193 and 194, during each of which Cao Cao captured a number of towns and engaged in collective punishment of the civilian populace. Background Cao Cao's father Cao Song was living in his hometown Qiao (Ë≠ô; present-day Bozhou, Anhui) after retirement until it became a battlefield when the Campaign against Dong Zhuo happened. So Cao Song along with the rest of Cao's family moved to Langya (ÁêÖÈÇ™; present-day Linyi, Shandong) in Xu Province. By 193, Cao Cao had established a base in Yan Province (covering present-day southwestern Shandong and eastern Henan), and invited his father over to his territory. However, before Cao's family could reunite, they were murdered on the border of Xu Province and Yan Province. There were two accounts of how they were murdered. One was that the governor of Xu Province, Tao Qian, sent his men to kill Cao's family because he was defeated by Cao several times. The other was that Tao Qian actually sent people to protect Cao's family because he was afraid of Cao Cao. But his men killed Cao's family for the great fortune they owned. Regardless of Tao Qian's culpability, Cao Cao intended to hold him responsible for the murder of his father.Records of the Three Kingdoms, 1.11, biography of Cao Cao: ËààÂπ≥ÂÖÉÂπ¥Êò•ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñËá™ÂæêÂ∑ûÈÇÑÔºåÂàùÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÁà∂Âµ©ÂéªÂÆòÂæåÈÇÑË≠ôÔºåËë£Âçì‰πã‰∫ÇÔºåÈÅøÈõ£ÁêÖÈÇ™ÔºåÁÇ∫Èô∂Ë¨ôÊâÄÂÆ≥ÔºåÊïÖÂ§™Á•ñÂøóÂú®Âæ©ËÆéÊù±‰ºê„ÄÇ The first invasion In the summer or autumn of 193, Cao Cao invaded Xu Province with an unspecified number of troops and easily captured over ten cities.Zizhi Tongjian, 60.1945: ÁßãÔºåÊìçÂºïÂÖµÊìäË¨ôÔºåÊîªÊãîÂçÅÈ§òÂüéÔºåËá≥ÂΩ≠ÂüéÔºåÂ§ßÊà∞ÔºåË¨ôÂÖµÊïóÔºåËµ∞‰øùÈÉØ„ÄÇRecords of the Three Kingdoms, 8.249, biography of Tao Qian: ÂàùÂπ≥ÂõõÂπ¥ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÂæÅË¨ôÔºåÊîªÊãîÂçÅÈ§òÂüéÔºåËá≥ÂΩ≠ÂüéÂ§ßÊà∞„ÄÇË¨ôÂÖµÊïóËµ∞ÔºåÊ≠ªËÄÖËê¨Êï∏ÔºåÊ≥óÊ∞¥ÁÇ∫‰πã‰∏çÊµÅ„ÄÇË¨ôÈÄÄÂÆàÂâ°„ÄÇHistory of Chinese Warfare, vol. 4, p 67 After conquering Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu), Cao Cao killed possibly more than 10,000 defenders.

Notes # The Zizhi Tongjian (60.1945) has \\"autumn\\", while the Records of the Three Kingdoms (1.11) has \\"summer\\". History of Chinese Warfare specifies \\"the sixth month\\" (vol. 4, p 67), which would have been around August. # This casualty statistic, which appears in Tao Qian's biography in Records of the Three Kingdoms (8.249), is attached to a phrase describing the Si River being dammed with the bodies of the dead. According to Rafe de Crespigny (To Establish Peace, volume 1, internet edition (2004), p. 68 note 24 [internet pagination]), this is unsupported by geography and probably happened during Cao Cao's massacre of civilians somewhat farther south, not during his battle at Pengcheng. Thus, the casualty figure is most probably not reliable. # The Book of the Later Han (73.2367) also includes Pengcheng and Fuyang (ÂÇÖÈôΩ; in present-day Linyi, Shandong) among Cao Cao's ravages.

() is a payment systems company headquartered in Naples, Florida. ACI develops a broad line of software focused on facilitating real- time electronic payments. These products and services are used globally by banks, financial intermediaries such as third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges, merchants, corporations, and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including automated teller machines (‚ÄúATM‚Äù), merchant point of sale (‚ÄúPOS‚Äù) terminals , bank branches, mobile phones, tablet computers, corporations, and internet commerce sites.  History  ACI was founded in Omaha, Nebraska as Applied Communications Inc, in 1975, to develop software for communications applications using the new NonStop computers from Tandem Computers. The founders were James Cody, Dave Willadsen, and Dennis Gates. Chuck Hackett, Charly Foglesong, and Mike May began ACI's relationship with Tandem. Early projects involved building systems to handle ATMs and front ends for core banking systems, which led to the launch of the first product, BASE24, in 1982. BASE24 was coined by a salesman to represent \\"Baseline Software for 24 hour-per-day system operations\\". BASE24 was expanded over time to service transactions from other channels, such as POS terminals and bank branch systems.

It is a binary form for representing simple data structures like arrays and associative arrays. MessagePack aims to be as compact and simple as possible. The official implementation is available in a variety of languages such as C, C++, C#, D, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript (NodeJS), Lua, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, Smalltalk, and Swift. Data types and syntax Data structures processed by MessagePack loosely correspond to those used in JSON format. They consist of the following element types: *nil *bool, boolean (\`true\` and \`false\`) *int, integer (up to 64 bits signed or unsigned) *float, floating point numbers (IEEE single/double precision) *str, UTF-8 string *bin, binary data (up to 232-1 bytes) *array *map, an associative array *ext (arbitrary data of an application-defined format, up to 232-1 bytes) * timestamp (ext type = -1) (up to 32-bit seconds and 64-bit nanoseconds) Comparison to other formats MessagePack is more compact than JSON, but imposes limitations on array and integer sizes. On the other hand, it allows binary data and non UTF-8 encoded strings. In JSON, map keys have to be strings, but in MessagePack there is no such limitation and any type can be a map key, including types like maps and arrays, and, like YAML, numbers. Compared to BSON, MessagePack is more space-efficient. BSON is designed for fast in-memory manipulation, whereas MessagePack is designed for efficient transmission over the wire. For example, BSON requires null terminators at the end of all strings and inserts string indexes for list elements, while MessagePack doesn't. BSON represents both arrays and maps internally as documents, which are maps, where an array is a map with keys as decimal strings counting up from 0. MessagePack on the other hand represents both maps and arrays as arrays, where each map key-value pair is contiguous, making odd items keys and even items values. The Protocol Buffers format aims to be compact and is on par with MessagePack. However, while JSON and MessagePack aim to serialize arbitrary data structures with type tags, Protocol Buffers require a schema to define the data types. Protocol Buffers compiler creates boilerplate code in the target language to facilitate integration of serialization into the application code; MessagePack returns only a dynamically-typed data structure and provides no automatic structure checks. MessagePack is not covered by an RFC but referenced and commented in rfc7049 of CBOR.

History  Genetic was established in 1980 by Martin Rushent and Alan Winstanley. The facility was built in a barn at Rushent's home in Streatley. Rushent decided to focus on electronic music after working heavily with guitar-based punk bands in the late 1970s - including The Buzzcocks and The Stranglers. Rushent began the studio after seeing an advertisement for the Roland Micro Composer. He thought the device looked \\"pretty good\\", and bought a Roland Jupiter synth to go with it. Rushent purchased Synclavier and Fairlight CMI synthesisers (at ¬£25,000 each) and an MCI console to use in the studio. He spent ¬£35,000 on the studio's air conditioning system, and had a Mitsubishi Electric digital recorder costing ¬£70,000. After the success of Dare in 1981, Rushent extended the studio to house a second control room and recording booth. The MCI desk was moved to the new rooms, and a Solid State Logic (SSL) desk was bought to be used in the original studio. Rushent later said that the new desk \\"had the most advanced mix functions of any board available at the time, so everybody wanted to use it. What everybody missed was the fact that, in [his] view, the SSL may sound technically correct, but it's never sounded musically correct.\\" He stated that he hated working on the SSL, and that it \\"ended up ruining [the] main control room.\\" Rushent sold his home and Genetic in 1989, and the studio continued to operate until the early 1990s. The complex was sold for ¬£906,000 in 2000, then ¬£1.5 million in a second sale 3 years later. The site was later demolished and in 2007 a planning application was submitted to West Berkshire Council to build a ¬£12 million luxury home, which was later built.

Life  Canto was the descendant of an old Uruguayan family. Her ancestors included some important military men. Her brother Patricio Canto was also a writer, and authored the essay El caso Ortega y Gasset about the Spanish philosopher. Estela held various jobs during the late 1930s and early 1940s, including as a dancer-for-hire at a local dance hall, where men would pay women \\"by the dance\\" to serve as their partners.Un personaje de pel√≠cula, La Naci√≥n, 5 September 2000 In 1944, at the house of Adolfo Bioy Casares and Silvina Ocampo, Canto was introduced to Jorge Luis Borges. Borges was, at this time, already well regarded in literary circles. Initially he took little notice of Canto. Though she observed him with admiration and curiosity, she had no interest in forming romantic attachments to intellectuals. On their second meeting at Bioy's house, Borges asked her out. After an evening of dancing and chatting they discovered, among other things, a common admiration for George Bernard Shaw. Borges fell in love with Canto and wrote her a number of romantic letters, which Canto would later publish in her 1989 book about their relationship. In this book, Canto said of their relationship: Borges' mother Leonor Acevedo Su√°rez disliked Canto on account of her sexual liberality and casual affairs with men. Nevertheless, Borges proposed to her. She replied: Borges' infatuation with Canto faded with time. Many years later they reestablished contact and became friends. Borges dedicated The Aleph to Canto and gave her the original manuscript as a gift. It is widely assumed that Canto was the inspiration for the character of Beatriz Viterbo, the narrator's unrequited love.http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-148999 Adi√≥s al amor de Borges, El Tiempo, 12 June 1994 Canto sold this manuscript to Sotheby's for thirty thousand dollars, and it was later bought at auction by the National Library of Spain.Letraslibres.com Canto contributed numerous translations to Sur, including selections from In Search of Lost Time.Sobre los traductores de Proust, La Naci√≥n, 6 November 2005  Work  The bulk of Canto's work describes life in Buenos Aires in the time before Peronism.openlibrary.org In 1989 she published Borges a contraluz, a biography of the author in which she recounted various intimate details of their relationship.

She was bred in Maryland by Milton Polinger. She was a gray out of the mare Summer Classic who was sired by Summer Tan. Her sire was What Luck, a multiple stakes winning son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Bold Ruler. What A Summer's pedigree and partial racing stats What A Summer is probably best remembered for her win in the Grade II $65,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes over stakes winners Dearly Precious and Artfully on May 14, 1976.  Two-year-old season  What A Summer was trained very early in her career by Hall of Fame conditioner Bud Delp while racing for her breeder, Milton Polinger. She was bought by Mrs. Bertram Firestone following Polinger's death in the early fall of 1976. That death delayed her the first start of her career until late in the year. Mrs. Firestone turned the mare over to trainer LeRoy Jolley. What A Summer did not start racing until near the end of her two-year-old season, when she broke her maiden at Philadelphia Park. Near the end of the year, she won an allowance race. She ended the year with two wins in four starts.  Three-year-old season  In January, What A Summer placed second in her first stakes race, the $25,000 Heirloom Stakes at the old Liberty Bell Race Track in Philadelphia. Two months later, she won her second allowance race over winners and convinced her connections that she was ready to step up in class and take on stakes winners in the Grade II $65,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. In that race, she withstood a fast closing challenge down the stretch to hold off a late charge by 4:5 favorite Dearly Precious in a final time of 1:42.40 for the mile and one sixteenth on the dirt track at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. Her jockey, Chris McCarron, was credited with a solid ride by conserving energy with moderate fractions in the middle portion of the race. Stakes winner Artfully held on for third in the field of ten three-year-old fillies. In December 1976, What A Summer won the $50,000 Anne Arundel Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse, beating Turn the Guns and Avum in 1:38.20 for the mile under McCarron.  Four-year-old season  In 1977, What A Summer won the $75,000 Fall Highweight Handicap twice, carrying the high weight of 134 pounds under jockey Jacinto V√°squez. The Fall Highweight is run in November of each year at Aqueduct Racetrack. In the 1977 race, she finished in a time of 1:09.4 and she broke the stakes record for six furlongs. That year, she also won the $40,000 Silver Spoon Handicap, the $50,000 Maskette Handicap and the $35,000 Distaff Handicap. She placed second in the grade one Beldame Stakes at Belmont Park and showed in both the $40,000 Grey Flight Handicap and the $25,000 Regret Stakes.  Five-year-old season  In 1978 as a five-year-old, What A Summer repeated two of her victories from the year before in both the Fall Highweight Handicap, under Hall of Fame jockey √Ångel Cordero Jr., and the $40,000 Silver Spoon Handicap. She also won the $40,000 First Flight Handicap. She placed second in the grade two Vosburgh Stakes, the grade three Vagrancy Handicap, the Sport Page Handicap, the Suwanee River Handicap and the Egret Handicap.  Honors  What A Summer was named Maryland-bred horse of the year in 1977 and twice was named champion older mare for the state of Maryland in both 1977 and 1978. She was retired in 1978 and as a broodmare she produced several graded stakes winners. After her retirement, Laurel Park Racecourse named a race in honor, the What A Summer Stakes. She was an Eclipse Award winner and was named American Champion Sprint Horse in 1977. What A Summer ended her career with a record of 18 wins out of 31 starts in her career. Her most memorable race was perhaps her dominating performance in the de facto second leg of the filly Triple Crown, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. In addition to her 18 wins, she placed nine times with earnings of $479,161. That record of 27 first or second finishes in 31 starts at 87% is among the best in history.2007 Maryland Jockey Club Media Guide, page 466 on March 3, 2007.

Their sound is progressive psychedelic alternative rock. They recorded and released two albums in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with different bass players and multiple guests on each album. The band was described as \\"acid-y, slinky and soulful,\\" and as having a style somewhere between The Flaming Lips and later-period Marvin Gaye. History Ty Willman and Kevin Guess co-wrote most of the music for the two studio albums that have emerged from the partnership: an eponymous 7-song debut EP CD in 1998, and a 14-song full- length CD in 2002, entitled Undertown, both of which featured several other notable musicians.

They are considered to be an endangered/rare species in some states, due to siltation, pollution, and construction of dams.  Description  All lampreys have a long, almost eel-like, body with no scales. Lampreys have segments of muscles that are visible along their body called myomeres, and a jawless mouth. In larval lampreys, called ammocoetes, their mouth is not fully developed, very small, and hidden between folds of skin. Adults have a disk shaped mouth with varying amounts of teeth depending on the species. The Ohio lamprey has a single, continuous dorsal fin. Fully grown, Ohio lampreys reach 10-14 inches, but may get to 15 inches.  Diet  As ammocoetes, Ohio lamprey filter plankton, algae, and other small organic matter. As adults, they attach onto larger prey, such as smallmouth bass, walleyes, redhorse suckers and trout and feeding on blood and body fluids. Ohio lampreys do not appear to kill the host fish, as they evolved with other fishes in their range. As a result, they do not appear to have a significant effect on populations of their host fishes.  Reproduction  As a sexually mature adult, Ohio lamprey will seek out suitable breeding sites. They likely do not return to their natal site to spawn, but this remains untested. Spawning occurs in late May or early June, with adults working together or in pairs to create a pit in riffles of moderate currents. They use their suction cup-like mouth to move rocks from these riffles, and then the female lamprey deposits eggs into this pit after mating. All adults will die after spawning.  Distribution  The Ohio lamprey is found throughout the Ohio River basin in 11 states: Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The Ohio lamprey used to be found in Illinois, but is now considered to be extirpated; the last sighting was in 1918.

According to the 1925 price list, a basic vehicle cost 89,000 CSK, with an open-top phaeton priced at 115,000 CSK and the limousine 135,000 CSK. With the introduction of the eight-cylinder engine in 1927, the car gained even more prestige and was termed the Rolls-Royce of Czechoslovakia. The car was particularly well received after its 1931 update, with motoring journalist Denik N√°rodn√≠ calling it the favoured vehicle of the Czechoslovak elite (\\"\\"). The last example to be used as a presidential carriage was a 1935 limousine presented to Masaryk by his successor Edvard Bene≈°. Production A total of 1,196 vehicles were produced, of which 897 had four-cylinder engines, with 299, the later model, with an eight-cylinder engine.

The type species, Gustafsonia cognita, was described in 1986 by Eric Paul Gustafson, who originally interpreted it as a miacid and named it Miacis cognitus. It was subsequently considered to be the only species of the diverse genus Miacis that belonged to the crown-group Carnivora, within the Caniformia,Spaulding, M.; Flynn J.J.; Stucky, R.K. (2010) Anew basal Carnivoramorphan (Mammalia) from the ‚ÄòBridger B‚Äô (Black‚Äôs Fork Member, Bridger Formation, Bridgerian NALMA, Middel Eocene) of Wyoming, USA. Paleontology 53: 815-832. and it was ultimately assigned to the family Amphicyonidae. The type specimen or holotype was discovered in Reeve's bonebed, western Texas, in the Chambers Tuff Formation in 1986. The University of Texas holds this specimen. It is the only confirmed fossil of this species. Morphology =Fossil= The holotype is missing the mandible, upper canines, and zygomatic arch. The remainder of the skull is damaged, but relatively intact. =Teeth= It preserves the old style of many teeth, probably having forty-two, as compared to most modern carnivorans in the low thirties. With the later species of Miacis, the size of the certain teeth were decreasing, namely the foremost premolars. These teeth would eventually be lost all together, resulting in the fewer number of teeth seen in most modern carnivorans, especially feliforms, including extant hyenas, viverrids, herpestid, and the famously few-toothed felids. Most members of Miacoidea have forty four teeth, so this advanced species has already lost two bottom premolars. Though the upper canines are missing, these teeth can be reconstructed due to the foramen for the tooth root remaining intact. These canines were not particularly long or short, though they were not stout or shaped for great stress. The molars of this species were small and not suited for grinding large amounts of material. The premolars show carnassial form that makes carnivorans unique and were good for slicing rather than crushing or grinding. drawing of the original holotype The African palm civet (Nandinia binotata), a modern species resembling Gustafsonia cognita in skull morphology. =Comparison to modern species= The skull of G. cognita is long and low. In skull morphology, the African palm civet, Nandinia binotata takes the prize of looking most like its distant relative. Digital morphology and CT scanning The information core for the Digital Morphology library is generated using a state-of-the-art high-resolution X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scanner. This instrument is comparable to a conventional medical diagnostic CAT scanner, but with greater resolution and penetrating power. The CT scanner was custom built and optimally designed to explore the internal structure of natural objects and materials at mega- and microscopic levels. This instrument is at the center of The University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT), a designated NSF-supported Multi- User Facility. Now in its seventh year, UTCT has scanned hundreds of rocks, meteorites, fossils, and modern organisms, providing unique data and visualizations for a wide range of interests in education and research. The holotype of Gustafsonia cognita was made available to the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility for scanning by Dr. Timothy Rowe of The University of Texas at Austin, Department of Geological Sciences. The specimen was scanned by Richard Ketcham on 3 December 2007 along the coronal axis for a total of 1010 slices. Each 1024√ó1024-pixel slice is 0.08551 mm thick, with an interslice spacing of 0.08551 mm and a field of reconstruction of 40 mm. Surface views allow one to roll, pitch, and yaw the specimen to see the fossil as though you were holding it in your hand. A second series is much more in depth slice movies, with coronal, transverse, and sagittal slices of the fossil. The last series is a dynamic cutaway from coronal, transverse, and sagittal angles as well. a facial profile of Gustafsonia cognita Evolution The mass extinction of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event left many ecological niches open and powerful competition to fill them. Species who previously had needed to be small and hide as a way of life suddenly had the requirement released and there was a strong pressure to get big and successful. The Paleocene was a period of struggle in which animals that had been occupied with avoiding being eaten by dominant species, namely the dinosaurs, were suddenly competing against each other to become the next dominant organism. Most mammals were small, many the size of rabbits, few exceeding the size of cats. The competition between the two groups of predatory mammals, the creodonts and the Carnivoramorpha, resulted in the better adapted creodonts occupying the position of top predators. As the Eocene continued, they were the dominant hunters and the carnivorans remained relatively small, staying out of the way. Miacis lived during this period. Miacis belongs to the stem-group Carnivoramorpha that began to diversify during the middle and late Oligocene. Two major lineages appeared, the feliformes (cats, hyenas, civets, palm civets, etc.) and the caniformes (dogs, bears, pinnipeds, skunks, ferrets, etc.). The tables began to turn and the creodonts were struggling during the late Oligocene when the carnivorans, while small, were well off. Open niches left by extinct predators were quickly filled by the small carnivorans, and they became larger and more diverse until their peak in the Miocene when the last of the creodonts had died out. Ecology the local, large oreodont Merycoidodon the medium-sized equid Mesohippus Reeves bonebed is well known for its oreodonts, especially Bathygenys. This oreodont, related to modern llamas, is very common in the formation, and being small for an oreodont at about thirteen pounds, it would have been hunted by Miacis regularly. The creodont Hyaenodon was also present in the fossil bed, and it is probably that this larger creodont hunted the larger oreodont Merycoidodon who, at over two hundred pounds, would have killed attacking Miacis. The large brontothere Menodus would have been far too large for Miacis, and if anything would have been a danger for the small carnivore. Miacis would have avoided this species completely to avoid injury from massive perissodactylid. The medium-sized herbivores Agriochoerus, Hyracodon, Mesohippus and Leptotragulus, were again probably Hyaenodon prey and Miacis would have left it alone completely. Leptomeryx inhabited the same range and was smaller. Its young would have been ample prey, and the adults might have been tackled. The rodent Ardynomys was of perfect size and would have been hunted by Miacis. Within the region, there were many smaller rodents, and with so many animals in the area that were too large for Miacis to kill, it is likely that the small animal, somewhere between the size of a cat and a begal, would have been a prolific rodent hunter and a hunter of Bathygenys.

Architecture The building dates from the 16th century, with later additions and alterations. In the 19th century its exterior was stuccoed and castellated. Later in the century a billiard room and a service wing were added. The house is constructed in brick on a stone plinth, with a half-timbered core. Pevsner describes it as a \\"modest C16 house [which] was absorbed into an early C18 one, which was brought up to date in the late C18 with castellations, a fine fanlight, and fashionable Roman cement\\". Manchester Corporation replaced a \\"good medieval timber roof\\" in the stable block with a steel roof. The hall, together with outbuildings to the east, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History of the house In 1811 Mr Pearson, a silk manufacturer, was living at Buglawton Hall. In 1883 the owner of the house was Fanny Pearson, a widow, who died that year. One of Fanny Pearson's daughters, Julia Pearson, married Charles William Doherty, who was the son of the Chief League of Justice of Ireland, John Doherty, who was a relation to the UK's shortest serving prime minister George Canning. Together they had children, including their daughter Madelaine Doherty, who was believed to be the last owner of Buglawton Hall. School In 1947 there was discussion about the local authority buying the building for use as a grammar school. In 1950 it was purchased by Manchester City Council. The school was opened in 1954 as a school for maladjusted children. The school was residential and had the capacity to take 41 children. In 2000 Ofsted found the school, which was by then termed a Special school for children with Emotional and behaviour disorder, to be Effective. In 2006 Ofsted found the school to be Good, though noted that the boarding accommodation was in a poor condition. In 2008 Ofsted judged the school to be Inadequate and requiring Special Measures. They listed, amongst other issues, that there was no headteacher in post and therefore management and oversight were poor; behaviour management was inconsistent; children did not make enough progress to make up for previous poor attainment; there were safety issues; and there was no recording of disciplinary sanctions taken against children or of occasions when children were restrained. As a result of this, in 2009 the executive principal was sacked. In 2011 Ofsted judged the school to be Satisfactory and it came out of Special Measures. In 2013 Ofsted again judged the school as Inadequate and requiring Special Measures. There were serious concerns about leadership, governance, behaviour management and children's safety, and teaching required improvement. In addition, \\"serious allegations of a child protection nature were being investigated by the appropriate authorities\\". In 2014 Ofsted judged the school as Good and no longer requiring Special Measures. In 2017 the local authority decided to close the school; it had 14 pupils at this point and some of the buildings were disused or not fit for purpose. In 2018 the school was closed.

The car was presented just two years after Armand Peugeot had split away from the Peugeot family business in order to concentrate on cars, with a separate Peugeot Automobiles business.  History  In 1889 Peugeot attended that year's Paris Universal Exhibition, where he was demonstrating four of his Peugeot Type 1 prototypes, which were powered by steam engines (from L√©on Serpollet). The Type 1 received a tepid reception, and Peugeot was already aware of the limitations arising from the vibration profile and sheer weight of a steam engine in this type of car-sized powered vehicle. The visit to the exhibition was not wasted, however, as he also came across the revolutionary invention of Gottlieb Daimler, a reciprocating combustion engine powered by petrol/gasoline. As soon as the exhibition was over Daimler arranged for his engine to be assembled in France by Panhard et Levassor of Paris and came to an agreement with Peugeot for its use in a new quadricycle. Peugeot was also able to negotiate with the widow of Edouard Sarazin. Sarazin's acquisition, before he died, of the rights to manufacture the Daimler combustion engine in France, made his widow, Louise, a key figure in the early life of the motor industry in France, which would be the world's top auto producing nation till out-produced by the United States in 1906. S. Bellu (1998), L'√©veil d'une industrie, p.18 Approximately a year after Armand Peugeot's eventful visit top Paris, the Peugeot Type 2 appeared, to be followed by the Type 3, which events together marked the inauguration of the Peugeot automobile business.  Performance  The Peugeot Type 2 was powered by a two-cylinder four stroke V-format petrol/gasoline engine, assembled under licence from Daimler. The engine was mounted underneath the seat, above and slightly ahead of the rear axle to which it was linked by a chain-drive. 2 hp of power was provided from the 565 cc unit. A maximum speed of 18 km/h (11 mph) was recorded. Cooling being then as now a challenge in a combustion engine, the Type 2's engine incorporated tubes filled with water, adumbrating the radiator that would be an essential feature of many combustion engines in the ensuing centuries. A wheelbase of 1400mm supported a vehicle length of 2300 mm. The width and height were respectively 1350 mm and 1450 mm. A rudimentary suspension system pointed the way ahead regarding what would become another mainstream feature of the motor car. The main Peugeot business was, at this time, expanding rapidly its bicycle production, and the Type 2‚Äôs light weight may have incorporated lessons learned from cycle production. Four Type 2s were produced. Three were quadricycles while the fourth was a tricycle. They all had space for two on the bench above the engine.

Biography He became a priest in 1334 with the benefice of H√∂skuldssta√∞ir √° Skagastr√∂nd and in 1343 the Archbishop of Nidaros granted him Brei√∞ab√≥lsta√∞ur √≠ Vesturh√≥pi, one of the best farms in the region, in what is now Vestur-H√∫navatnss√Ωsla, in Northern Iceland. Einarr held this benefice until his death. Einarr was one of the leading clerics in the diocese of H√≥lar, taking various official roles. He is best known, however, for his writing: he began the annal L√∂gmannsann√°ll, a chronicle which Einarr continued up to 1361, when it was taken over by someone else. He almost certainly composed L√°rentius saga, a biography of Einarr's friend and teacher L√°rent√≠us K√°lfsson, sometime after 1346; and wrote or otherwise appeared in a number of official documents. In 1381, he also translated the miracle-story Atbur√∞r √° Finnm√∂rk from Latin into Icelandic.Alfr√¶√∞i √≠slenzk: islandsk encyclop√¶disk litteratur, ed. by Kristian K√•lund, Samfund til udgivelse af gammel nordisk litteratur, 37, 41, 45, 3 vols (Copenhagen: Samfund til udgivelse af gammel nordisk Litteratur, 1908-18) i (1908), pp. 57-59. Einar was thus a prominent member of the North Icelandic Benedictine School, and Laurentius saga is an important witness to the lives of its members. Einar was the son of Hafli√∞i Steinsson, who had been a priest of the Norwegian king, a r√°√∞sma√∞r (steward) at H√≥lar from 1292 to 1308 and finally the priest at Brei√∞ab√≥lsta√∞ur √≠ Vesturh√≥pi until his death in 1319; his mother was Hafli√∞i's concubine Rannveig Gestsd√≥ttir. Einar was sent to study with L√°rent√≠us K√°lfsson at the monastery of √ûingeyri at the age of 10, later becoming a follower and secretary for L√°rent√≠us. Too ill at the time to ordain Einarr, L√°rent√≠us sent Einarr to the southern diocese of Sk√°lholt for consecration there by Bishop J√≥n Halld√≥rsson in 1332. Einarr is also one of the few fourteenth-century Icelanders known to have travelled outside Scandinavia. According to his annals, in 1347 Einarr \\"{{langislgeck ... af landi brott. ok for til paua gardz ok var j Auinione .ix. n√¶tr. for vm Frankarike aftr ok fram. ok var j Paris. vm nockorn tima\\" (\\"went ... away from the land [Norway], and travelled to the papal court, and was in Avignon for nine nights, and travelled widely in France, and was in Paris for some time\\").L√∂gmannsann√°ll, in Islandske annaler indtil 1578, ed. by Gustav Storm (Christiania: Gr√∏ndahl, 1888), p. 274.

Like his brother Memed Abashidze, he was one of the principal champions of pro-Georgian orientation in the largely Muslim region of Adjara, heavily contested during and immediately after World War I. After Soviet takeover of Georgia in 1921, Abashidze fled to Turkey, where he died in unclear circumstances. Biography Born in Batumi, Aslan-Beg Abashidze was a member of the Muslim branch of the Georgian noble family of Abashidze, hailing from Adjara. The family continued to be held in high esteem even after the Russian acquisition of the area from its previous overlord, the Ottoman Empire, in 1878.

He received military training at Constantinople and returned to Georgia after the ouster of the Russian monarchy in the 1917 revolution. During this period of turmoil, Abashidze fought for the integration of Adjara into a newly independent Georgia and formed a legion of Muslim Georgians, which fought against the Armenian forces in December 1918. He is credited with having written a military song \\"Aslanuri\\", popular at that time. He was awarded the rank of general and continued his service in the Georgian ranks until the overthrow of the Georgian republic by the Soviet Russian Red Army in February‚ÄìMarch 1921.

Biography Drozhzhin was born in the village of Nizovka, part of what is now Tver Oblast. He only spent two winters at school, and then the 11-year-old boy was sent to St.Petersburg to work. He spent the following years wandering around Russia, and mastered many crafts. During his stay in St. Petersburg (1860 - 1871), he worked on his self-education and got to know works by, among others, Nikolay Nekrasov, Aleksey Koltsov, Ivan Nikitin, and Leo Tolstoy. At the age of 16 he wrote his first poem, and in 1867 started his diary which he kept for the rest of his life. His poems were first published in 1873 in a magazine called \\"Gramotey\\" (\\"The Educated One\\"). This publication was followed by others. Due to his poor state of financial affairs, and the influence of Count Leo Tolstoy, whom he met in 1892 and 1897, he returned home to Tver region in 1896 and devoted himself to writing. The son of a serf, he earned renown as a talented self-educated poet. He welcomed the October Revolution, which he saw as the realization of the people's hopes and aspirations. This is expressed in his poems Opening Song (1920), At the Village Assembly (1920), and In Memory of V. I. Lenin (1924). Drozhzhin‚Äôs poetry was influenced by Aleksey Koltsov and Nikolay Nekrasov. Some of his verses have been set to music and have become part of Russian folklore. In 1938 a museum devoted to Drozhzhin was opened in the settlement of Novozavidovski in Tver Oblast. The Russian Academy of Sciences awarded him with two medals for his poetry. Several of Drozhzhin's poems were translated into German by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke.

Many industries, such as the Food Industry, utilize machines similar to the Kneader reactor to produce goods. For example, polymers, chewing gum can be produced using these machines. Although the machine has existed for decades, kneader reactors are only recently gaining popularity in the processing industry.  Description  The kneading reactor is a horizontal mixing machine with two Sigma, or Z-type blades. These blades are driven by separate gears at different speeds, one running 1.5 times faster than the other. The reactor has one powerful motor and a speed reducer to drive the two blades. The kneader reactor usually has a W-type barrel with a hydraulic tilt that turns it, and a heating jacket outside.  Usage  The kneader reactor uses very high viscosity materials such as chewing gum, dough, toffee, Plasticine, rubber, silicone, adhesive or resin. These materials have a viscosity of approximately 1,000,000 cps. They are mixed with reactants such as liquids, powders or slurries; the reaction mass does not undergo a physical phase change while the reaction takes place.  How to select  If a phase change does occur during processing, the conventional technology requires the use of diluents (or dilutants). Diluents are solvents which decrease the viscosity of the reaction mass, enabling mixing in the reactor, and help to control the reaction temperature. More recently, manufacturers have sought technological solutions that allow synthesis in the concentrated phase, minimizing or eliminating the use of solvents and thus intensifying the process. This \\"dry\\" process is possible in a kneader reactor.  History  The Sigma kneader was developed by Heinz List, a pioneer of modern industrial processing technology. List recognized that processing in the concentrated phase with little to no solvent, also known as \\"dry processing\\", would increase process yield per unit volume and would therefore be more profitable. List developed the reactor to overcome the technical complexities of processing in the concentrated phase.  Technology advantages  Kneader reactors offer a number of technological advantages for dry processing: * Excellent mixing and kneading performance during wet, pasty and viscous phases * Large working volume reactors efficiently handling large product volumes * Large heat-exchange surface areas yielding highest possible surface-to-volume ratio * Maximum self-cleaning * Narrow residence-time distribution for plug flow operation * Adaptive for a wide range of residence times * Closed design for cleaner production environment * Robust design for high viscosity processing * Compact design maximizing process yield per performance volume and minimizing space requirement Kneader reactor technology has long been used for what is known as ‚ÄúProcess Intensification‚Äù, where multiple processing steps are performed in the same unit. Such units are characterized by high yield per performance volume and also have the flexibility to produce different grades and/or products.

He is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a former professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Contributions In 2004, Agol proved the Marden tameness conjecture, a conjecture of Albert Marden. It states that a hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated fundamental group is homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3-manifold. The conjecture was also independently proven by Danny Calegari and David Gabai, and implies the Ahlfors measure conjecture. In 2012 he announced a proof of the virtually Haken conjecture, which was published a year later. The conjecture (now theorem) states that every aspherical 3-manifold is finitely covered by a Haken manifold. Awards and honors Agol, Calegari, and Gabai received the 2009 Clay Research Award for their proof of the Marden tameness conjecture. In 2005, Agol was a Guggenheim Fellow.

It is the second film to be distributed by The Weinstein Company under the Dimension Films brand, and the last before it folded in 2018. The film is directed by Malcolm D. Lee and written by David Zucker and Pat Proft. It was released on April 12, 2013. The film is the only installment of the franchise not to feature Cindy Campbell (played by Anna Faris) or Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), due to the end of their storyline. It premiered on April 11, at the Hollywood‚Äôs ArcLight Cinerama Dome. The film parodies various horror films and other popular culture. Plot Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan get together to make a sex tape with over 20 cameras beside Sheen's bed. The time-lapsed tape fast forwards through the two doing all sorts of bedroom antics, including gymnastics, riding a horse, and having clowns jump in under the sheets. Sheen is pulled into the air by a paranormal force and thrown against walls, shelves, and doors until he lands on the bed again. Lohan is frightened so she decides to go home when she flies into the air as well; she becomes possessed and throws Sheen into the camera and kills him. The text explains that Sheen's body was found that day but he didn't stop partying until days later and that his three kids were found missing, Lohan was arrested, again, and a reward was put out for the missing children. Several months later, Ja'Marcus (Snoop Dogg) and D'Andre (Mac Miller) are walking in the Humboldt County woods in California in search of cannabis plants to steal. After stealing one and fleeing, they take shelter in a cabin in the woods. Upon entering they see three strange creatures, later confirmed to be Sheen's children, and turn them in for the reward. The feral children are placed in isolation at a child development research center for a few months until they are deemed well enough to be returned to familial custody. When Sheen's brother, Dan Sanders (Simon Rex) and his wife Jody (Ashley Tisdale) come to collect them, they are told they can have them if they agree to stay in a large suburban middle-class home fitted with security cameras. Jody is reluctant to take the kids at first but soon adjusts to having them. In an attempt to bond with their new children, Jody auditions for a ballet performance, Swan Lake, and is cast in the lead role as the Swan Queen. Meanwhile, a continuing pattern of bizarre paranormal activity in their new home makes them investigate further. They eventually learn from the children that the attacks on their home are by \\"Mama\\", the mother of the children, who is under a curse and is trying to get them back so she can sacrifice both herself and the children. Maria, the couple's Hispanic live-in maid, is frightened and keeps experimenting with various rituals, Catholic and otherwise, to ward off the evil spirits in the house. During the day, Dan is frustrated with the modest progress of his test subjects at a primate intelligence research facility; ironically, Dan is not bright enough to realize that one of the chimpanzees, Caesar, is now actually much smarter than he is. One night, the pool drain invites others to a party. In the morning, Maria sees the mess in the pool and does more rituals, causing Dan to fire her. Because Dan doen't understand her Spanish, they start a fight that leads to the lab that cause all the apes to be released. Jody and Dan, with the help of Jody's close friend Kendra Brooks (Erica Ash), who Jody met at her ballet class, must quickly find a way to lift the curse and save their family. Along the way, they seek the assistance of psychic Blaine Fulda, who turns out to be a complete fraud, and a dream extractor named Dom Kolb (Ben Cornish), who helps them understand that the solution to their problems lies in the mysterious Book of the Evil. However, Jody and Kendra fail to see what the book is capable of, oblivious to four friends continuously becoming possessed and reviving in the cabin. They wreak havoc when either of the two read the two passages of the book; one that unleashes demons, \\"gort klaatu barada nikto\\", and the other that revives them from possession. When \\"Mama\\" takes the children to a cliff to sacrifice them, Jody fails to lift the curse with the book, but does manage to knock the evil spirit into Ja'Marcus and D'Andre's pool containing a live shark, which then devours her. Realizing the love for her adopted children is all she needs in life, Jody gives the part of the Swan Queen to Kendra, who performs the dance in the style of a stripper. The performance is heavily applauded by an audience that includes Jody, Dan, the children, Kendra's family, and Madea. The story's narrator is revealed to be Caesar, who then informs the audience that the humans should enjoy the time they have on Earth and says that apes will one day take over the world. In a post-credits scene, Sheen wakes up, with Dom Kolb sitting beside him, from a dream extraction, i.e. the whole movie was a dream. After Kolb informs that Sheen will be sleeping with Lohan, a car crashes into the room, killing Sheen. Lohan is revealed as the driver; she gets out of the car, says to Kolb, \\"You were driving,\\" and throws him the keys, blaming the accident on him.

IGN gave the film a 1.0 out of 10. Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film zero stars saying, \\"The movie is so appalling that even a film fan who guffawed her way through The Aristocrats would feel nothing but a deep emptiness as the end credits begin to roll, wondering if one solid joke was too much to ask from a movie that bills itself as comedy.\\" Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film one star saying, \\"Down at the bottom of the comedy barrel, where the slimy gray algae-like stuff lives: That‚Äôs where this script came from. If you must go to Scary Movie 5, be sure to bring an iPad with you. That way you can watch a better movie on it.\\" Joe Neumaier of The New York Daily News gave the film one star saying, \\"Like so much of this whole series ‚Äì hatched in 2000 by the Wayans brothers and intermittently directed by Airplane! veteran David Zucker, though newcomer Malcolm D. Lee takes over here ‚Äì the mere mention of a familiar pop culture figure or title is supposed to be hilarious. It often isn't, and in fact the constant name-dropping and gross- out humor gets tiresome (in a movie that's at least 10 minutes too long). Luckily, folks like Snoop and good sports like Sheen and, yes, Lohan, break up the monotony. Until, like an undead beastie, the boredom and dumb jokes come roaring back.\\" Rafer Guzman of Newsday felt that \\"Even the talented people ‚Äì comedian Katt Williams as a fake psychic, high-energy actor Jerry O'Connell in a send-up of the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' books ‚Äì get chewed up and spit out by this relentless anti-laugh machine. Scary Movie 5 doesn't even have the imagination for a worthwhile gross-out joke. When the best you can offer is a poopy toothbrush, it's time to pack it in.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly said \\"Hitting theaters seven years after the last Scary Movie, the new film doesn't even feature the ameliorating presence of Anna Faris, who gave the earlier films a certain spoofy grace. In her place is High School Musical refugee Ashley Tisdale, her face frozen in an eye roll of mild irritation. Who can blame her? The film hopscotches between too-late riffs on Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Inception, Insidious, and Black Swan. At a running time of 86 minutes, it's about as long as an episode of Saturday Night Live, except with less laughs and worse storytelling.\\" Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said \\"The filmmakers‚Äô desperation is evident from the fact that a good chunk of the running time is devoted to spoofing the recent Jessica Chastain starrer Mama. While that film was indeed a sleeper hit, it hardly seems memorable enough to warrant such sustained treatment, and indeed the comic payoffs are nil.\\" The film has earned three nominations at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Supporting Actress for Lindsay Lohan, Worst Screen Combo for Lohan and Charlie Sheen and Worst Prequel, Remake, Ripoff or Sequel.

Example incidents  In one such instance, in New York City, a dispute between a clinic entitled Upper Breast Side (that gives advice to young mothers about breastfeeding and bras) and a condo association erupted into a legal battle and was described in The Boston Globe as a brouhaha and a 'storm in a D-cup'. The Washington Post described an incident as a brouhaha in which a passenger, on board a jetliner, reclined the seat to the point where it bothered a second passenger, resulting in a fistfight, intervention by flight attendants, and the plane returning to the airport escorted by fighter jets.

The \\"Throwing Off Asia\\" units included some woodblock prints produced in Japan as propaganda during the Chinese-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895. One of the prints illustrated Japanese soldiers executing \\"violent Chinese soldiers,\\" with human heads scattered on the ground and blood gushing from the captives' necks. Visualizing Cultures Original Web Page Sample A campus-based Chinese student- led protest ensued, saying that the purpose of the project was not sufficiently clear to contextualize the negative messages of the historical images on the site. The protest led to general concerns over academic freedom and the right to student protest. The website was temporarily taken down in response to the criticism. H-Asia, an international history and online discussion forum of scholars and teachers in the Humanities & Social Sciences, published a section on the controversy, and exchanges between Chinese and Japanese researchers ignited a debate upon how it should be handled. Other articles on it included Benjamin A. Elman's \\"Teaching through the MIT Visualizing Cultures Controversy in Spring 2006\\". After a week, the authors agreed to include additional context to the sections before republishing their work. The website is currently online. In 2015, Duke University published a journal article, 'Reconsidering MIT Visualizing Cultures Controversy,' edited by Winnie Wong and Jing Wang, on the debate seen in the larger critical context, is coming out from Positions: Asia Critique, Vol. 23, No. 1 (2015).Positions: Asia Critique, Vol. 23, No. 1 (2015) The special issue reflects upon the student protest and public controversy over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Visualizing Cultures website in 2006 from multiple perspectives. Three sets of questions raised by the incident are addressed by contributors to the volume. The first entails questions over the changing narratives of nationalism and history in Sino- Japanese-US relations, and as taught to and contested by Chinese overseas students. The second revolves around the use and display of visual images in pedagogical, digital, and scholarly contexts, examining debates over authority and interpretation of propagandistic, racist, and violent visual imagery. The third stems from the promises of digital media and examines the challenges of public participation and dissent in the pedagogical sphere. In what ways should or could the norms of scholarship, pedagogy, and student interaction evolve in response to the digital turn, to the globalization of the student body, and to the appropriation of visual technology in the classroom?

It is a remake of the 2008 Dutch-language Belgian film Loft, which Van Looy also directed. The screenplay was written by Bart De Pauw and adapted by Wesley Strick. Starring Karl Urban, James Marsden and Wentworth Miller, it also features Matthias Schoenaerts who reprises his role from the original film. The film was shot in Summer 2011, but its theatrical release was delayed by a change of the film distributor. Dark Castle Entertainment originally acquired the US distribution rights, as they did for Splice, with the intention of releasing the film through Warner Bros. When Joel Silver moved his office to Universal Studios, he took Dark Castle, and the film with him. Universal planned to release the film on August 29, 2014, but the studio pulled it from the schedule in favor of Legendary Pictures' As Above, So Below. Universal and Dark Castle dropped the film, which was then picked up by Open Road Films, who released it on January 30, 2015. Universal retained the US home entertainment rights through its ancillaries deal with Open Road. Dark Castle, however, hasn't produced another film till 2017's Suburbicon with Paramount Pictures. Plot 5 married men share ownership of an upmarket loft, which they use to discreetly meet their respective mistresses. When the body of a murdered woman is found in that loft, the men begin to suspect each other of having committed the gruesome crime, as they are the only ones with keys to the premises. Through flashbacks, which are intertwined with scenes from the present, the story is unraveled. The five men are: * Vincent Stevens (Karl Urban): architect and designer of the building where the loft is situated; married to Barbara (Valerie Cruz) and has children; the one who initially suggests the five use the loft as a private oasis, he is set up by the other men to be accused of the murder. * Luke Seacord (Wentworth Miller): married to Ellie (Elaine Cassidy), who is an insulin-dependent diabetic; the one who discovered the body and initially calls Vincent and the others over to the loft. The police later insinuate that he is attracted to Vincent. He also recorded the men's activities in the loft without them knowing. * Dr. Chris Vanowen (James Marsden): a psychiatrist married to Allison (Rhona Mitra), half-brother to Philip. Chris and Philip have a half-sister, Zoe (Madison Burge). The most reluctant of the men to the idea and the last to accept a key to the loft, Chris eventually does so because he is attracted to Ann (Rachael Taylor), who eventually becomes his mistress. She tells Chris not to fall in love with her because she is a prostitute. He gives her his key as proof he does not use the loft with other women. * Marty Landry (Eric Stonestreet): married to Mimi (Kali Rocha); a heavy drinker and an obvious lech. He and Mimi become separated when a woman he slept with on a business trip shows up at his home. * Philip Williams (Matthias Schoenaerts): half-brother to Chris as they have the same mother; recently married to Vicky (Margarita Levieva), who is the only daughter of a wealthy property developer, who is also his boss. He is a drug user who grew up in a dysfunctional household with his abusive father; very protective of his younger sister Zoe, and warns the other men off having sex with her. The murder victim is Sarah Deakins (Isabel Lucas): Vincent, Luke, and Marty met her at a bar; both Vincent and Luke are attracted to her, but she hooks up with Vincent and becomes attached to him. At a party they are both attending, Sarah threatened to tell Vincent's wife about the affair as a way to have them break up, but she is dissuaded from this by Luke. She seemingly tries to commit suicide at the loft, by taking pills with champagne. She is discovered by Luke, who calls Chris, Marty and Philip, showing them a note to Vincent. The note read \\"See you in the next life\\"; this note is taken from the loft by Chris. The men were motivated to set Vincent up by Luke, who showed them DVDs of Vincent having sex with Marty's wife, Mimi; Chris's prostitute, Ann (who Vincent had paid to allow Chris to seduce her, so that he would take a key to and use the loft), and Zoe, Philip and Chris's younger sister. Three of the men leave to set up their alibis, with Philip remaining at the loft to stage the scene. He takes some cocaine and cuts Sarah's wrists, using her bloodied finger to write a Latin phrase similar to that in her suicide note. He then handcuffs Sarah's right hand to the bed. Over the course of the movie, as the five men discuss what to do with the body, Luke, Chris, Marty, and Philip drug Vincent, strip and handcuff him to the body on the bed. Before Vincent passes out completely, Chris tells him about Sarah's suicide and the contents of her note. While being questioned by the police, Vincent tells them of the set-up, but they do not believe him as the only prints found were Vincent's and Sarah's. They also have the DVDs of his sexual exploits, except the ones with Mimi, Ann, and Zoe; they won't believe him that Luke made the videos and the DVDs of the other men were not found. The police also mention that all four men have alibis for that morning ‚Äî Chris and Luke were seen together having breakfast, Marty was at his office, Philip was alibied by his father-in-law (who was blackmailed with information about his own cheating, information Philip had because he knew Vincent used that same information to blackmail his father-in-law to give him a contract on a project). Releasing Chris from interrogation, Detective Huggins (Kristin Lehman) tells him that Vincent has been arrested for murder; he is surprised as he thought Vincent would only be implicated in Sarah's suicide. The detective further states that the pills did not kill Sarah, that her wrist cuts were not self-inflicted, the prints on the knife were Vincent's and they didn't find a suicide note. The surprised Chris thanks Huggins and leaves. Outside of the police station, he reaches into his jacket pocket, only to find that the suicide note Luke gave to him is gone. He then walks to the loft and confronts Luke about the missing note. After initially denying that he had it, Luke leads Chris to the note, which was in the garbage. Chris looks at the note and wonders why Luke would get rid of the only evidence of the attempted suicide, speculating that Luke, not Sarah, was the author of the note. Luke then tells Chris everything; he framed Vincent, because he was attracted to Sarah himself, and felt that Vincent stood between him and Sarah. We see that Luke had gone after Sarah the night she almost told Vincent's wife about the affair. He told her that Vincent was using her and not worth it, and that he could treat her better. She rebuffs him, saying she felt nothing for Luke. Hurt, Luke turns around to find that his wife saw him talking to Sarah. When Sarah returned to visit Vincent at the loft, Luke showed up and drugged Sarah, trying to kill her ‚Äî out of \\"love\\" ‚Äî with an insulin overdose. He then staged the suicide with the pills, champagne bottle, and suicide note. Chris then tells him that Vincent is being charged with murder as Sarah hadn't been dead when they left her with Philip. Luke then states that technically it was Philip who killed Sarah and that he will clean the situation up. When Chris says no more cleaning up, Luke pulls out a kitchen knife and threatens him. Sirens can be heard and Chris says he called the police, told them everything and that it is over. He and Luke struggle, and he gets the knife from Luke. Luke tells Chris to tell Ellie and their kids that he's sorry; he then jumps from the loft's balcony, killing himself. Six months later, Mimi and Marty are reconciled, Philip is facing trial for manslaughter, and Chris is divorced, sharing custody of his kids. He runs into Ann after leaving a bar, and she asks if he needs the loft key, that he had given her for them to meet up. Chris mentions the key would not work as Vincent now lives at the loft, since it was the only thing his wife left him with from their divorce. Chris mentions that he heard Ann left the congressman, one of her clients as a prostitute, and she replies that he's not the only thing she gave up, implying that she's no longer in that line of work. Ann asks Chris if he would like to grab a cup of coffee with her as the scene fades away.

According to CinemaScore, audiences gave the film a grade of \\"B‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. J.R. Jones of the Chicago Reader wrote in his positive review of the film: \\"The twisty plot translates to any culture where swinging-dick businessmen cheat on their wives ‚Äî which is to say, any culture.\\" https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the- loft/MovieTimes?oid=16258569 Jackie K. Cooper of jackiekcooper.com wrote in his positive review of the film: ‚ÄúThe Loft‚Äù is a surprisingly entertaining film that keeps the audience in the dark as to its villain(s) until the very end. The fact the ending is logical and difficult to anticipate makes this movie an above average feature. There is also some solid acting from a cast not particularly known for the type of roles they are inhabiting.\\" Cooper also wrote in his review: \\"If you like movies that keep you in the dark until the reveal then this is a movie you want to see. Believe me, it is so much better than you think it is going to be.\\" https://jackiekcooper.com/the-loft/ Jim Lane of the Sacramento News & Review wrote in his positive review of the film: \\"It makes an intriguing if far-fetched puzzle, releasing plot twists in little driblets, with a cold and rather repellent cast to the characters and action (Nicolas Karakatsanis provides suitable cinematography, dominated by blues and blacks). As so often in such locked-room whodunnits, the solution is both simple and complicated, and quite satisfying.\\" http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/loft/content?oid=16210652 Jason Best of Movie Talk writes in a positive review: \\"The plotting gets too clever by half towards the end, but with striking support from Rachael Taylor and Isabel Lucas this remains a slick and stylish whodunit.\\" https://www.whatsontv.co.uk/news/the-loft-film-review-cunning-locked-room- mystery-thriller-keeps-us-guessing-to-the-end-311281/ Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter writes: \\"The film at least looks good, with cinematographer Nicholas Karakatsanis photographing the beautiful titular setting and gorgeous bodies on display with a glossy sheen. Despite the unfortunate fates befalling several of the characters, the film could well serve to encourage both extramarital affairs and the sale of upscale loft apartments.\\" https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/loft/review/768601 Joe Leydon for Variety writes: \\"Still, there can be no denying the interest and suspense Van Looy and scripter Wesley Strick generate during the opening scenes as they set the plot mechanics into motion.\\" https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/review- the-loft-1201420611/ Roger Moore for Tribune News Service writes: \\"But the quintet is well-cast, Urban (‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù) is swell, the darkly-menacing Schoenaerts (‚ÄúThe Drop‚Äù) provides some fireworks and the old-fashioned theatricality of it might appeal to some ‚Äî even Hitchcock himself.\\" https://rogersmovienation.com/2015/01/30/movie-review-the-loft-never-reaches- the-height-of-suspense/ =Box office= The Loft grossed $6,002,684 in the United States and $5,017,718 overseas for a worldwide total of $11,020,402. https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1850397/?ref_=bo_se_r_1 References External links  Category:2014 films Category:2010s erotic thriller films Category:2014 LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American erotic thriller films Category:Belgian films Category:Belgian LGBT-related films Category:English- language films Category:American remakes of Dutch films Category:2010s mystery films Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:Films directed by Erik Van Looy Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Films shot in Belgium Category:Films scored by John Frizzell (composer) Category:Open Road Films films Category:Films produced by Steve Golin ","title":"The Loft (film)"},{"id":"32084984","text":"Coleophora laevipennis is a moth of the family Coleophoridae.

Theory Based on 16th-century accounts of the Spanish conquistadors being \\"greeted as gods\\" by the peoples of the New World, certain modern authors have expanded the concept beyond what is historically verifiable, spreading it to the genre of pseudoarchaeological literature and fringe theorists, such as writers on ancient astronauts or Atlantis, in some instances (such as Christian Identity) even acquiring quasi-religious or racialist (white supremacist) connotations. Some authors have claimed that white missionaries or \\"gods\\" visited America before Christopher Columbus. Authors usually quote from mythology and legends which discuss ancient gods such as Quetzalcoatl to conclude that the legends were actually based on Caucasians visiting those areas, and that the Caucasians were really the gods. Spanish chroniclers from the 16th century claimed that when the conquistadors led by Francisco Pizarro first encountered the Incas they were greeted as gods, \\"Viracochas\\", because their lighter skin resembled their god named Viracocha.Colonial Spanish America: a documentary history, Kenneth R.

Mormonism Some Mormon theorists have suggested that the Izapa Stela 5 depicts the Tree of Life. Some Mormons believe that Quetzalcoatl, a figure described as white and bearded, who came from the sky and promised to return, was likely Jesus Christ. According to the scriptural account recorded in the Book of Mormon, Jesus Christ visited and taught natives of the Americas following his resurrection, and regarded them as the \\"other sheep\\" whom he had referenced during his mortal ministry. The Book of Mormon also claims that Jesus Christ appeared to others, following his resurrection, even to the inhabitants on the \\"isles of the sea.\\" With regard to the Mexican legend, LDS Church President John Taylor wrote: > The story of the life of the Mexican divinity, Quetzalcoatl, closely > resembles that of the Savior; so closely, indeed, that we can come to no > other conclusion than that Quetzalcoatl and Christ are the same being.

Afro-Guatemalans comprise 1-2% of the population. They are of mainly English-speaking West Indian (Antillean) and Garifuna origin. They are found in the Caribbean coast, in Livingston (a Garifuna settlement), Puerto Barrios and Santo Tomas. During the colonial period, African slaves were brought in, but have mixed with the general population and can be referred to them as Afro-mestizos. So, due to miscegenation, the majority of black people became in Mulatto (50% black-50% white) and Zambo (50% black-50% Amerindian) and these in turn became in Quadroon (75% white and 25% black) and Cambujos (75% Amerindian and 25% black). Due to centuries of miscegenation, Afro-Guatemalans (aside from the Garifunas) today form part of the country's mixed race, non-indigenous ladino population.  Origins  Due to the difficulty of slave ships arriving in Guatemala, buyers of the Kingdom of Guatemala depended on the vagaries of the market they did not control. For shipping list, we know that slaves came between the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly from Senegambia, Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast; in the seventeenth century, they came from the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin. And in the eighteenth century, they came from Biafra (Nigeria), West Congo, Angola, Guinea and Benin (from Kingdom of Whydah). In this century also arrived slaves Aja (who were known as Arar√°, coming from Allada, Benin) and \\"creole\\", from Puerto Rico and Jamaica. Also arrived Calabari, from Havana, Cuba.Google Book: Rutas de la Esclavitud en √Åfrica Y Am√©rica Latina (in Spanish: Routes of Slavery in Africa and Latin America). Page 202. Posted in 2001, by Rina C√°ceres G√≥mez. Many of the blacks slaves who worked in rural areas came, usually of Senegambia. In Addition, there were also many slaves bought in Luanda, Angola. There were also at least 30 other African ethnic groups - from the Central Africa - in Guatemala, chief among them the Kongo, and the mongiolos and anchico. Also, there was at least a dozen of slaves from West Africa, some them were bran (ethnic group from west of Ghana), Banyun (who were known as Banon, are established in Senegal, Gambia and Guinea Bissau) and biafadas (ethnic group of Guinea Bissau) people.  History  = Slavery = The first Afro-Guatemalan arrived in Guatemala in 1524 with Pedro de Alvarado (the ‚ÄúConqueror of Guatemala‚Äù). Records of the Cabildo of Santiago, in Almolonga from the 1530s also mention some enslaved blacks. This first city, founded in 1527 with 150 Spanish residents, was destroyed in September 1541 by an avalanche of water and mud of the Volc√°n de Agua (Volcano of Water) that buried the Spanish sector of the capital with a large number of Native Americans and a small number of enslaved blacks. However, the first significant costs that are reporting data from 1543, when an estimated \\"150 pieces pig\\" of Santo Domingo, were taken to the Caribbean coast of Guatemala. African slaves arrived in Guatemala to replace the indigenous population as labor, as their numbers had been reduced drastically from diseases such as measles, smallpox or bubonic plague. They were infected by the Spanish conquerors, and reduced to about a third of its population. African slaves were used in the sugar, indigo, and cochineal plantations. They were also used in the hacienda or large cattle ranch. Since Santiago was the political and economic center of Guatemala (and throughout the Spanish Central America), many of the slaves brought to the region, were bought and sold there, and were baptized in their churches and parishes and possibly also in their monasteries. Between 1524 and 1620, a total of 10,000 Africans were brought to Guatemala. So, because of the rise in power in the Middle East at the end of the sixteenth century, a large number of people started and to be identified as mulatto. According to Robinson Herrera, of 250 Africans bought and sold in Santiago, about 40% came directly from Africa. Eighty slaves came from West Africa, particularly in Senegambia and the Central - Western Africa. For the other 50 people, 20% were criollos (slaves born in Spain, Portugal or America), and the other ten were mulattoes. Although there were few free mulattoes in the region at this time, their number was greater than the mulattoes enslaved. Between 1595 and 1640 there was an increase in the importation of slaves to Guatemala, but after 1640, imports sharply declinedDel olvido a la memoria: africanos y afromestizos en la historia colonial de Centroam√©rica (in spanish: From Oblivion to Memory: Africans and Mulattoes in the colonial history of Central). (some authors indicated even that the importation of slaves ceasesInfluencia africana (in Spanish: African influence)). The first free black of Santiago first appeared already in the second half of the sixteenth century. Because of its small population, free blacks had to marry with other more numerous socioracials groups. Between 1595 and 1640, the Spanish crown signed a series of contracts with Portuguese traders to dramatically increase the number of African slaves in America. So many slaves came from the Angolan port of Luanda. Also, during the 17th century, some slaves could buy their freedom, forming a small community of free blacks. Runaway slaves formed Cimarrons societies, living among the population. Founded in 1590, the ingenuity of As√≠s, who became the most important in the seventeenth century, had more than 200 slaves and in 1633, the ingenuity of San Geronimo, north of Santiago, in Verapaz, was home to hundreds of slaves \\"of different nations\\" and became the largest in Central America. In 1821 there were more than 500 slaves. In the late seventeenth century, the Afro - descendant was scattered to the south and east of Guatemala and El Salvador. The impact of African immigration in early colonial times was deeper in the sugar mill in Amatitl√°n and mint of Escuintepeque shores, where is San Diego de la Gomera. The Afro - descendants lived in nearly two dozen locations between Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1823, after independence, arrived to Guatemala Gar√≠funa groups from Honduras. They occupied the Caribbean lowland. = Miscegenation and growth of social status = During colonial times and until the abolition of slavery in Guatemala (liberal government after independence) was important to the African population. Most Spanish houses of the time in Guatemala, especially in Santiago, had Indian servants and African slaves. In both cases, most of them were female. Because most Spanish who emigrated to Latin America at this time were men, looking rich and did not carry with them their wives, often had sex with her maids and female slaves, causing racial mixtures, increasingly abundant while growing the Spanish settlers in the territory, racial mixture which was maintained until the destruction of Santiago by severe earthquakes in 1773 and the jurisdiction of the new capital in Guatemala City in 1770. With racial mixtures, mulattoes, eventually came to outnumber blacks enslaved. On one side were those black and mulatto slaves who worked in houses and estates and on the other hand, a large population of free blacks who scattered in towns and cities. The growing miscegenation between black slaves and free mulattoes increasingly increased the population of free mulattoes. The drastic reduction in the importation of slaves to Guatemala and increased free slaves eventually prompted some places that have a predominance of slaves pass to have a predominance of free blacks. Moreover, the mixture of mulattoes and mestizos caused higher incomes and a higher position for those with lighter skin. While some roads were blocked for people of African descent, especially in college and in the church. While miscegenation and learning the Spanish language and standards were increased, more Afro - Guatemalans have access to jobs. So also, the slave population was mixed also with indigenous and white populations of Guatemala and the whole group of African people in the colony, were not \\"pure black\\", to call that. Many slaves were hired to work in various jobs such as in the carnage. The mulattoes were often involved in the illegal killing of livestock. Although we know little about Afro - Guatemalans working in the agricultural sector, several sources in the last third of the sixteenth century, identified Afros farming communities in the present Jalapa, El Progreso, Santa Rosa and Jutiapa departments, and in the area surrounding the city of Sansonante, in the current El Salvador. Many of these slaves were born in Africa, usually in the region of Senegambia. However, it also had African slaves born in America. The Pacific coast was also home to many blacks and mulattoes free sticking by his great abilities as vagueros, to the extent that the laws of the sixteenth century forbidding them riding on horses or have weapons were almost always ignored because their skills were as necessary as feared, skills that would later valuable recruits from colonial militias and gave opportunity for upward social mobility. Free people of African descent and slaves also worked on the production of indigo in the Pacific coast of Guatemala and, especially, of El Salvador. People of African descent tended to work in the mills, usually doing the work of supervision during Xiquilite harvest. This station lasted only one or two months a year, making it unprofitable to maintain a permanent workforce only enslaved workers to produce indigo. Some owners of mills, hired more slaves of which them needed to produce indigo since used for other activities, such as livestock. Between 1595 and 1640, the Spanish crown signed a series of contracts with Portuguese traders to dramatically increase the number of African slaves in America. So many slaves came from the Angolan port of Luanda, mostly slaves who were used as laborers in the sugar cane, since in these years were enormously developing sugar production in the territory. = Afro-Guatemalan militias = In 1611, when the free mulattoes helped defeat the Maroons of Tutale, not allowed people of African descent officially participate in militia companies, but Africans and their descendants, even enslaved, had fought with Spanish forces from time to time since the conquest. However, in the 1630s, a wave of attacks Centre - America, by corsairs Dutch, French and British persuaded to the Audiencia to enlist free people of African descent in regular militia companies, although segregated. In 1673 there were 6 companies browns in Guatemala and two in El Salvador. Soon there were also places like chivalry in Sonsonate Department and Chiquimula. After early struggles against the corsairs, the browns requested exemption of Labor√≠o Tribute, threatening not to serve if they are not granted the exemption. Because of that, several companies of militia were temporary tax exemptions Laborio during the 1690s, including the San Diego de la Gomera. The militants claimed this success and soon new Exemptions requested when aspirated initials. Soon, the rest of the Afro - descendants also expected to be relieved Labor√≠o tribute, and prepared to face the authorities on the subject, rebelling them.

They are mostly descendants of enslaved Africans brought to the Western Hemisphere during the Atlantic slave trade. This term also sometimes refers to the combining of African and other cultural elements found in Venezuelan society such as the arts, traditions, music, religion, race, and language.  History  = Slave Trade = Between 1576 and 1810, about 100,000 African slaves were transported to Venezuela via Portuguese, Catalan, French, English, Belgian and Dutch slave ships. These slaves belonged to various ethnicities from present-day Angola, Senegal, Gambia, Benin, Nigeria and the Congo, such as: Kalabari, Yoruba, Kongo, Wolof, and more. Slaves were treated as units of commerce, referred to as pieza de india in reference to their physique and potential for travail. Throughout the sixteenth century, slaves were brought to toil in the gold mines in Coro and Bur√≠a (Yaracuy) and to Isla Margarita and Cuman√° for fishing and pearl diving. Small-scale agricultural plantations were also initiated in Venezuela, especially among the regions surrounding Caracas. In the 18th century, immense shipments of slaves were transported to Barlovento to aid the burgeoning cacao industry, indigo plantations in the Venezuelan Llanos and the sugar plantations in Lara, Aragua and Zulia, around Lake Maracaibo.  Slave rebellions  The history of slave revolts in Venezuela, both in the form of runaway communities and mutiny, began quite early. The first documented insurrection was in Coro on 1532. However, the most momentous revolt of the time took place on the Bur√≠a mines on 1552. The rebellion was led by El Negro Miguel (also known as Rey Miguel), who founded a cimarr√≥n, or cumbe (escaped slave) settlement and had himself proclaimed king. He developed an army of 1,500 slaves, Blacks, Mulattos, Zambos and Indigenous peoples to attack colonial establishments. Numbers of runaway-slave communities continued to increase throughout the seventeenth century, and by 1720 there were between 20,000 and 30,000 cimarrones in Venezuela, as opposed to the 60,000 slaves still working on the plantations (Rout 1976, 111112). Barlovento was the site of intense cimarr√≥n activity throughout the eighteenth century, with several cumbe settlements being established around Caucagua and Curiepe. The most famous of these was that of Ocoyta, founded around 1770 by the legendary Guillermo Rivas. After he led raids on various plantations both to liberate slaves and to punish overseers, a special army was raised to destroy Ocoyta and execute Rivas. \\"Cumbe\\" derives from the Manding term for \\"out-of-the-way place\\". Typically located above river banks or in remote mountainous areas, cumbes were usually well hidden and housed an average of 120 residents. Such settlements were also called and . Cimarrones were frequently aided by indigenous tribes living in the area (e.g., the Tomusa in Barlovento), and cumbe populations were composed not only of Blacks, but also of Indians and even of poor Whites. Cimarr√≥n groups conducted raids on plantations, assisted in the escapes of other slaves, and participated in contraband trading. The only legally established town of free Blacks was that of Curiepe, established in Barlovento in 1721 under the leadership of Captain Juan del Rosario Blanco. The community was composed of former members of Caracas's Company of Free Blacks as well as huangos from the Antilles. The latter were escaped slaves who, like all Blacks fleeing non-Spanish-speaking islands, were granted freedom upon arrival in Venezuela if they accepted baptism. = Abolition of slavery = Afro- Venezuelans played a crucial role in the struggle for independence. Originally, slaves fought for the Crown, believing that the landowning creole Republicans were their enemies. In particular, the notorious royalist battalion of General Jos√© Tom√°s Boves attracted many slave soldiers. Bol√≠var, realizing the strategic importance of Black soldiers in the fight for independence, declared the abolition of slavery in 1812 and again in 1816, after promising Haitian president Alexandre P√©tion that he would secure freedom for slaves in return for Haitian military aid. A major landowner himself, Bol√≠var freed 1,000 of his own slaves, and in 1819 recruited 5,000 slaves into his army. Jos√© Antonio Pa√©z, a key figure in Venezuelan independence, led an army of Blacks from the llanos (plains). One of his most famous lieutenants, Pedro Camejo, has been immortalized in Venezuelan history as \\"El Negro Primero\\", because he was always the first to ride into battle. In the final battle of Carabobo, Camejo was mortally wounded but returned to General Pa√©z to utter one of the most famous statements in Venezuelan history: \\"General, vengo decirle, adi√≥s, porque estoy muerto\\" (General, I have come to say goodbye, because I am dead). A statue of El Negro Primero stands in the Plaza Carabobo in Caracas. Curiously, he is sometimes depicted wearing a turban, the same iconography used for the mythical Negro Felipe. With the declaration of independence in 1810, all trafficking in slaves was outlawed. The decline in slavery continued throughout the War of Independence when, at its conclusion in 1821, the \\"Ley de vientre\\" was passed, stating that all children born, whether of slave or free parents, were automatically free. By 24 March 1854, the date of slavery's official abolition in Venezuela, less than 24,000 slaves remained. = Aftermath of slavery and racism of the 20th century = Throughout the twentieth century, Blacks in Venezuela have faced subtle forms of racial discrimination despite a philosophy of racial democracy and an ideology of mestizaje that contends all groups have blended together to form a new, indistinguishable type, called the mestizo. Yet underlying this ideology is a policy of blanqueamiento, or \\"whitening\\", that has encouraged both the physical and cultural assimilation of Afro-Venezuelans into a Euro- dominated mainstream. An important semantic counterpart to the process of blanqueamiento is that found in the term negrear, which denotes concepts of \\"marginalization\\" or \\"trivialization\\". The emergence of Black intellectuals such as Juan Pablo Sojo and Manuel Rodrigues C√°rdenas in the 1940s, and more recently of younger writers such as Jes√∫s Garc√≠a, has helped counter the forces of blanqueamiento, or assimilation. A strong body of research in Afro- Venezuelan history and folklore has also been established by Venezuelan scholars, particularly Miguel Acosta Saignes (1967). Public festivals such as the Fiesta de San Juan have emerged as focal points in the reappropriation of Afro-Venezuelan culture, articulating current transformations in a living tradition of cimarronaje (resistance to the dominant culture, consciousness of being marginal).  Cultural expression  = Religion = Afro-Venezuelan religious practices have been adapted to Catholicism. Drumming and dancing, which figure in the celebrations of patron saints' days and other religious ceremonies, bear a close resemblance to various forms of African ancestor worship. Because the slave population was so heterogeneous, no single African religious system dominated in this syncretization process, as it did for example in Cuba, Brazil, and, to a lesser extent, in Trinidad with its Yoruba tradition. There has also been some intersection with indigenous cosmological systems. Figures such as , , and are types of spirit beings connected with the dead or forces of nature, which act as intermediaries between the parallel realms of physical existence and that of the spirit world. It is through contact with these beings, usually dwelling in deep riverine pools, that (healers) derive their power and divine the future. These beings are also responsible for the deaths and disappearance of various people. Such beliefs are articulated in the oral traditions not only of Afro-Venezuelans but of indigenous and mestizo peoples as well. The influx of Cuban immigrants after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 has encouraged the establishment of the Afro- Cuban religion Santer√≠a among Venezuelans of all cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Although this is a predominantly urban phenomenon, African influences in Venezuela continue to evolve through a dynamic and continuous migration of cultural practices and forms.  Religious practitioners  Organized as they were around patron saints, Black cofrad√≠as were not simply social organizations, but also religious ones. Some cofrad√≠as were subdivided into separate \\"societies\\" that had distinct responsibilities. Sojo (1986) reports that in Barlovento, for example, each day of Holy Week had a separate society that was in charge of maintaining the holy images and ritual ceremonies associated with the respective day. In preparation, members would practice celibacy, abstain from consumption of alcohol, and perform various ablutions before \\"dressing\\" the saintly image. Since colonial times, magico- religious societies have also existed, employing various forms of brujer√≠a, or \\"witchcraft\\". In Afro-Venezuelan communities, as in the rest of Venezuela, there is belief in brujos (sorcerers), who can cast spells and cause various forms of da√±o (harm). Fear of mal de ojo (\\"evil eye\\") against children is particularly common. Curanderas are sought for their knowledge of herbal medicines, which are used both in combatting illness and counteracting da√±o. In Barlovento, healers are sometimes called ensalmadores and are particularly respected for their ability to divine the future as well as to find lost objects and people. = Arts and ceremonies = Afro-Venezuelan ceremonies have been primarily linked to the Christian calendar, and many Afro-Venezuelan music, dance, and costume traditions are associated with specific church celebrations. The Nativity, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, the Cruz de Mayo, and patron saints' holidays are central to Afro-Venezuelan expressive culture throughout the country. The D√≠a de los (Feast of Fools, 28 December) is also celebrated and is particularly important in Barlovento, where \\"governments of women\\" are set up parodying male authority with absurd decrees and other actions such as cross-dressing. Carnival celebrations (the week before Lent) are significant, especially in eastern Venezuela, where in communities such as G√ºiria and El Callao there has been a large Caribbean influence. During saints' feast days, promesas (promises) made to the saints in return for personal favors are fulfilled. Correct observance of ritual activities such as offerings, drumming, dancing, and the feeding of all those present are essential to satisfying these promises. In various regions of Venezuela, different religious holidays have emerged as important local celebrations. Around Lake Maracaibo, the fiesta of a Black saint, San Benito, (26 December to 2 January) is prominent and is celebrated with the playing of chimb√°nguele drums. In Cata, Chuao, Cuyagua, and Ocumare de la Costa (Aragua), Naiguat√° (Distrito Federal), San Francisco de Yare (Miranda), and Canoabo and Patanemo (Carabobo), the Diablos Danzantes (organized into cofrad√≠as) are the centerpiece of the Corpus Christi celebrations, performing in particularly vivid costumes and masks that incorporate African imagery. In Barlovento, the Fiesta of San Juan Bautista (Saint John the Baptist) has been of singular importance since slavery. The three days of San Juan (23 to 25 June) were the only three days of the year during which slaves were given a rest from hard labor and were permitted to gather freely. During the holiday, not only would slaves celebrate with drumming and dancing, but also plot insurrection and flight. = Music = Afro-Venezuelan musical expression is characterized by a great diversity of drums. Most are of African origin and many bear direct resemblance to the drums of Bantu-speaking and West African groups. Generally, drums use specific rhythmic patterns to accompany specific song or dance forms; hence, drums, rhythms, and stylistic forms may all be designated by the same name. In turn, this stylistic complex is usually associated with a specific fiesta or celebration. In Barlovento, the culo e'puya drums are important, as are the mina and curbata, which are played together. Quitiplas are also prominent in Barlovento. These are fashioned from hollow bamboo tubes and played by striking them on the ground. (They are similar to the Trinidadian \\"tambou bamboo\\" that gave rise to steel-drum styles.) Along the central coastal region, the cumaco is widespread, used in San Juan celebrations as well as the secular bailes de tambor (dances). The tamunango is found in Afro-Venezuelan communities in the interior. To the west, in Zulia, the chimb√°ngueles are used to accompany San Benito festivities, and a friction drum called is commonly played during Nativity celebrations and the singing of . In the eastern coastal regions, influence from Trinidad is evident in the performance of steel-band () music. Maracas (seed-filled rattles) are prevalent throughout Venezuela and are commonly used to accompany drumming, as is another indigenous-derived instrument, the conch. Other small percussion instruments, such as the charrasca, a small notched scraper, are also used as accompaniment. Less common instruments found in Barlovento and along the coast include the , a large bass \\"thumb-piano\\" derived from the African ; the , a musical bow similar to the Brazilian ; and the , a large mouth-bow (Aretz 1967). As in other parts of Venezuela, the four-stringed cuatro is extremely common. = Folklore = In addition to musical, dance, and costume traditions, oral lore forms an essential part of Afro-Venezuelan expressive culture. Some of the best-known tales in Afro-Venezuelan oratory center around the exploits of T√≠o Conejo (Uncle Rabbit), who manages to outwit T√≠o Tigre (Uncle Tiger). In the twentieth century a small body of Afro- Venezuelan literature has been established, including the works of novelist and folklorist Juan Pablo Sojo and the poet Manuel Rodrigues C√°rdenas. Theater and dance groups, which have a long history of performance in Barlovento, have become progressively more important with the appearance of such groups as the Centro de Creaci√≥n Teatral de Barlovento-Curiepe, the Teatro Negro de Barlovento, and Madera.  Afro-Venezuelans today  = Identification = Afro-Venezuelans are designated by Spanish terms; no words of African derivation are used. \\"Afro-venezolano\\" is used primarily as an adjective (e.g., folklore afro-venezolano). \\"Negro\\" is the most general term of reference; \\"Moreno\\" refers to darker-skinned people, and \\"Mulatto\\" refers to lighter-skinned people, usually of mixed European-African heritage. \\"Pardo\\" was used in colonial times to refer to freed slaves, or those of mixed Euro- African-Indigenous background. \\"Zambo\\" referred to those of mixed Afro- indigenous background. \\"Criollo\\", which retains its colonial meaning of \\"being born in Venezuela\\", does not indicate any racial or ethnic affiliation. = Location = Afro-Venezuelans can be found all over the country, but the largest Afro-Venezuelan population is located in the Barlovento region, in the state of Miranda. Comprising an area of 4,500 square kilometers, Barlovento covers four districts of the state of Miranda. There are also important Afro- Venezuelan communities along the coasts of Carabobo (Canoabo, Patanemo, Puerto Cabello), the Distrito Federal (Naiguat√°, La Sabana, Tarma, etc.), Aragua (Cata, Chuao, Cuyagua, Ocumare de la Costa, etc.), and the southeast shore of Lake Maracaibo (Bobures, Gibraltar, Santa Mar√≠a, etc.). Smaller pockets are also found in Sucre (Campoma, G√ºiria), the southwest area of Yaracuy (Farriar), and the mountains of Miranda (Yare). An important Afro-Venezuelan community is also to be found in El Callao, in the southernmost state of Bolivar, where miners from both the French and British Antilles settled in the mid-nineteenth century. = Demography = In the 2011 census, 3.6% of Venezuelans self-identified as Afro-Venezuelan. Race is also perceived differently in Venezuela, for example: In the United States, Barack Obama is considered black, but in Venezuela he would be considered either pardo or mulatto. Similar to Brazil, in Venezuela, people tend to be categorized by how they look, such as: \\"moreno\\", \\"negro\\", \\"bachaco\\", etc. rather than actual ancestry. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica estimates that at least one-tenth of Venezuelans (3 million) have relatively pure Sub-Saharan African ancestry.http://www.britannica.com/place/Venezuela/Immigration-and-ethnic- composition The Brilliant Maps calculates that Afro-descendants comprise 4% of the Venezuelan population. However, most Venezuelans claim some African blood, and Afro-Venezuelan culture is acknowledged as an vital component of national identity.

Today, most have no idea about it as a result of racial pressures throughout the country for generations. However, Afro roots are clearly evident throughout El Salvadoran culture, its people and traditions. A total of 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548. The country has no English Antillean (West Indian) or Garifuna populations, largely due to laws enacted in the 1930s, later revoked in the 1980s, banning the immigration of Africans and other races into the country. During the colonial period in Latin America, African slaves began mixing with the general population, resulting in the Mulatto (50% African and 50% European) and Zambo (50% African and 50% Amerindian) populations, and these in turn became the Quadroon (75% European and 25% African) and Cambujo (75% Amerindian and 25% African) populations.  History  = Origins and distribution = The Quauhquechollan Cloth is a 16th-century cloth painting of the Nahua natives, and it includes what could be the very first African slave, still wearing his tribal regalia, that arrived in El Salvador in 1528.√Åfrica, la otra ra√≠z salvadore√±a (in Spanish: Africa, the other Salvadoran root). Posted by Marvin Aguilar Retrieved on February 13, 2013. However, most slaves began to be imported around the 1540s, following a royal decree officially freeing the indigenous peoples in 1548. Slaves came from the city of Santiago, in Guatemala, and were then distributed throughout Central America. Thus, many of the African people who worked in rural Salvadoran areas came from West Africa and usually, as in Guatemala's case, from Senegambia.Del olvido a la memoria: africanos y afromestizos en la historia colonial de Centroam√©rica (in Spanish: From Oblivion to Memory: Afromestizos in African and Central American colonial history). Furthermore, according to various colonial archives about the province of San Salvador, the slaves brought by Portuguese merchants to Acajutla, in the Salvadoran town of Sonsonate, came from Angola and \\"the Guineas\\", while the slaves brought by the British merchants came from Mozambique. The slaves mainly reached to Sonsonate, where they were redistributed to the rest of San Salvador and Sonsonate. = Forced migrations = African enslaved people arrived in the country by forced migration. The first enslaved person arrived in El Salvador to work in the haciendas, on cocoa and indigo mills, and in the gold mines. In San Salvador and San Miguel, many people enslaved African people, some of whom were sent to wash gold in Honduran rivers, which was a major industry in the sixteenth century. In 1545, there was a noted sum of about 1,500 African enslaved people seeking auriferous sands in Honduras. The intense richness of cocoa from Izalco made this one of the first regions to have significant numbers of African enslaved people due to the high demand for free labor. Thus arose several enclaves of African enslaved people in places such as the shores of Lake Coatepeque and in the town of La Trinidad in Sonsonate, on the banks of the river Cenz√∫nat. The people who were enslaved who served as foremen on the plantations were usually highly trusted by the people who enslaved them and were meant to intimidate the indigenous populations into submission. However, when cocoa was sold out, slaves were used in the cultivation of indigo, as several royal decrees had prohibited the use of Indian labor in the mills and the landowners needed labor. Consequently, there was considerable demand for African labor in the indigo mills, which was provided by the slave ships arriving on the north coast, usually transported by the Portuguese, who had supplier's license and a permit for introduction. Despite the later fall of the indigo industry, there was still a high demand for African labor due to investments for building Salvadoran cities. There were many slaves shipped into El Salvador. Thus came the next wave of African slaves who worked in the construction industry, particularly to begin construction of the railway in the nineteenth century, and another wave possibly came in the early twentieth century. These migrations resulted in places with black populations like San Vicente (in Verapaz), colonial San Miguel (in San Alejo), Zacatecoluca, Chinameca, and Ahuachapan in which the Africans worked in the indigo industry. Similarly, African slaves, who were active participants in the revolt of 1932, were found in Atiquizaya. Also, Nejapa in San Salvador, was initially populated mulattoes. = Progress and miscegenation increased the Afro- Salvadoran population = Although we know little about Afro-descendants of El Salvador (and Guatemala) working in the agricultural sector, several sources in the last third of the sixteenth century identified Afro-Salvadoran farming communities in the area surrounding the city of Sonsonante. Free people of African descent and slaves also worked on the production of indigo in the Pacific coast of Guatemala, and especially of El Salvador, eventually hosting over 200 indigo mills. People of African descent tended to work in the mills, usually supervising the Xiquilite (indigo) harvest. This process only lasted one to two months a year, making it unprofitable to maintain a permanent workforce where there were only enslaved workers to produce indigo. Some mill owners bought more slaves, some of which were needed to produce indigo, while others were used for other activities, such as tending to livestock. The Afro- descendants eventually began to mix with the general population, transitioning from a purely African population to the mulatto and zambo populations. African men readily chose Amerindian women, so their children would be free. Laws were later passed banning the miscegenation of the African and Amerindian populations for this reason. Many mulattoes became landowners and enjoyed privileges by being estate owners, often to the detriment of the natives. Several places were populated with mulatto families as they settled in prosperous neighborhoods, like the neighborhood of Angel in La Trinidad of Sonsonate, and neighborhoods in San Vicente, San Miguel, and San Salvador. They also were integrated into indigenous neighborhoods and villages in estates and royal lands, and later became the Ladino peoples.La Prensa gr√°fica. com.

In the eighteenth century there was an increase in the population of African descent. In 1807, the mulattoes were the largest segment of the population in San Salvador, and in 1821 San Miguel reported 95% of its population as Afro-descendants. = Abolition of slavery and beyond = During the Intendencia, when few African people remained enslaved, there were regulations for slave owners, by order of the Crown to the Audiencia Real. For example, the regulations were enacted in San Miguel in September 1804. The cabildo of St. Vincent of Austria and La Trinidad, in Sonsonate, also enacted it. Slavery was banned in 1825, which made El Salvador the second country to abolish slavery in the Americas after Haiti. Numerous slaves from Belize fled to El Salvador, eventually mixing with the native population. In the province of San Salvador, two thousand African peoples rose between November and December 1624, reaching militant troops from Comayagua (Honduras), to address the danger to the province. It was a contingent of indigenous and Ladino soldiers from Zacatecoluca and Apastepeque who captured the slaves, who were found in the banks of the Lempa River, in El Marquesado and the hill of the same name, as well as downstream near the mouth. All captured slaves were executed in San Salvador in 1625. This discouraged the importation of more African slaves. In the late nineteenth century, the Catholic Church began to classify the population. In 1933, General Hern√°ndez Martinez, concerned about the events in Europe and following the example of Adolf Hitler, wrote a law called the Immigration Limitations, prohibiting the entry of Africans, Asians, Arabs, Gypsies, and many others into the country. He did urge, however, the immigration of north-central Europeans to whiten the population. These events further strengthened the Salvadoran denial of African roots and the Afro- descendants legally disappeared. However, that law was abolished by the new laws of 1959 and 1986. = Afro-Salvadoran militias = In 1611, when the slave mulattoes helped defeat the Maroons of Tutale, Guatemala and El Salvador did not allow people of African descent to officially participate in militia companies. However, Africans and their descendants, even enslaved, had still fought with Spanish forces from time to time since the Conquest. Nevertheless, in the 1630s, a wave of attacks against Central America by Dutch, French, and British corsairs persuaded the Audiencia to enlist free people of African descent in regular militia companies, although segregated. In 1673 there were six Pardo companies in Guatemala and two in El Salvador. Soon there were Afro- militias in places like the Department of Sonsonate and Chiquimula, Guatemala. After early struggles against the corsairs, the militias requested exemption from Labor√≠o Tribute, threatening not to serve otherwise. Because of that, several militia companies were temporarily exempted from this tax during the 1690s. The militants claimed this success and soon other requested Exemptions were granted. Then, the rest of the Afro-descendants also expected to be relieved of Labor√≠o tribute, and prepared to face the authorities on the subject, rebelling against them. The most prominent example occurred in 1720 in San Salvador, where there had been a slave rebellion less than a century before. When the rumor that officials were preparing a new census for the Labor√≠o Tribute Collection spread throughout the mulatto neighborhoods, at least 200 people took to the streets, threatening to burn the residence of the mayor. The rioters were persuaded to return home only after they were shown the list, barely containing 40 names. Spanish officials, who did not dare to continue the account, estimated that the actual number of residents in the city who were eligible for inclusion in the census was about 1,000  Cultural legacy  El Salvador has a dance called \\"Negritos de Cacaopera\\" (in Spanish: Black people from Cacaopera).

Creoles of Nicaragua-Orientation  History  The euro-centric belief is that African descendants were first enslaved and brought to Nicaragua as servants of the conquerors and of civil and religious officials in the early 16th century, but there is increasing evidence to suggest Africans first arrived as free people sailing the Canary Current from West Africa to the Americas. The first African people enslaved were transported to Nicaragua were taken by Gil Gonz√°lez D√°vila, who purchased them for 300 pesos in Panama from Pedrarias D√°vila¬¥s colonial administrator. From there they took eleven enslaved individuals to the newly founded Nicaragua. They were already baptized before being taken to Nicaragua. In 1531, the council of Leon, asked the King of Spain for authorization to extract thousand slaves, tax free, to give to the neighbors. The council of Granada, Spain - in November 24, 1544 - asked the same authorization to import 50 people to enslave them in the opening of the \\"rapids of the drain\\". Also, Spanish colonists, who could no longer enslave the Indians following the New Laws of 1542, required workers in their newly formed haciendas. So, from 1558, Bishop Lazaro Carrasco, meeting with the Amerindians \\"almost all consumed\\" and less than a hundred Spanish neighbors without enough real entries, asked the King license to import 600 people of African descent to enslave them, they would remedy the situation, i.e., could produced the earth.‚âà The number of the first black people enslaved were imported must have been considerable, perhaps thousands. Because most Spanish who emigrated to America were men, soldiers and colonists took indigenous and African women as partners and concubines. As early as the 18th century, most people who were enslaved born in the territory were mulattoes. According to colonial documents, people of African descent who had been enslaved came from such ethnic groups such as Arara, mainly the Ewe and Fon from Ghana, Togo, Benin, the Yoruba people from Yorubaland, now located in Nigeria, Togo and Benin, El nuevo diario. com (in Spanish: New Diary.com).

The proportion of men and women slaves were very similar. Miscegenation caused a large release of enslaved people. Thus emerged middle classes formed by Zambo, mulatto and quadroon (those with a quarter black blood) and other mixtures. By 1820, persons of some African descent made up 84 percent of the population. But many of them were kept as slaves, probably hundreds. Thus, during the first half of the 17th century, many of the enslaved people were used in the indigo mills. Since the 17th century, several groups of enslaved people rebelled against his owners and migrated to other places and settled in small clandestine colonies, free from Spanish rule. Therefore, these enslaved people, the \\"Cimarrons\\" (cimarrones) were affected by several royal orders issued against them. One of them agreed to raise an army against those colonies and return enslaved people to their owners. This law was fulfilled in Nicaragua. However, the Spanish were not the only people to import people to make them slaves to Nicaragua. The English, who were colonists on the coast of Nicaragua since 1633, also imported groups of people to enslave since the late 17th century. The English began cultivating sugar cane and indigo around Bluefields and on the banks of the Rio Coco, which were labor-intensive crops.Costa Rica en el siglo XVIII (in Spanish: Costa Rica in the 18th century).

Breve Rese√±a Hist√≥rica - Asociaci√≥n Ind√≠gena para la Integraci√≥n y Desarrollo de la Regi√≥n Aut√≥noma de la Costa Atl√°ntica As in the case of slaves imported by the Spanish, the African slaves of the English mixed with the Miskito, Sumu and Rama indigenous peoples of the area. Most of ‚Äúcaseros‚Äù (derived of Spanish \\"Casa\\" -house- i.e., man assigned to domestic service in the homes of Creoles and Spaniards) black and mulatto enslaved people also performed agricultural and cattle, but were not the main operating system. Finally, following independence, slavery was abolished by the decree of the Constituent Assembly of April 17, 1824. However, to early 19th century arrived people who were enslaved from Jamaica to the Nicaraguan Caribbean coasts, when the region was a British protectorate. They became \\"Black creoles\\". More late, in 1832, some groups of Garifuna people came to the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua from Honduras for fighting for his land, be recognized as ethnic and preserve their cultural identity. However, the Garifuna were met with fierce opposition from the Miskito people, as indigenous of this territories, and of the Black Creole, who forced to them to accept English as the language for business transactions and a half for insertion and recognition in society.  Communities  Most enslaved people imported by the Spanish to Nicaragua were mixed during the colonial era and their mulatto and Quadroon descendants also re-mixed with the majority indigenous, mestizo and white. For this reason, today, the descendants of black enslaved people were imported by the Spanish in Nicaragua are mostly white people or Amerindian with some black ancestors. So, most Black Nicaraguans are descended from the enslaved people were imported by the British and of the West Indian immigrants who arrived on the shores of the country since the 17th century. Most Afro-Nicaraguans reside on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, which is also the vast and sparsely populated region, that had the British occupation from 1635 to 1860. The Afro- Nicaraguans are fundamentally divided into three groups, also present in Honduras: Creoles (majority group), Garifuna and Indigenous zambos. The Afro- Nicaraguan population is descended from enslaved people were exported from places as Panama, Nigeria, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Jamaica. = Indigenous zambos = These are indigenous groups formed by the mixture of African descent and the Sumo, Rama and Miskitos indigenous ethnic groups. Their African ancestors were slaves exported to the country by the English residents on the coast of Nicaragua, where they lived since 1633. Since the late 17th century, when the British began cultivating sugar cane and indigo around Bluefields and on the banks of the Rio Coco, there were imported the first African slaves to devote to this work. The slaves were also used for cotton plantations and especially for cutting mahogany. The arrival of African slaves to the area facilitated the race mixtures between this group and the natives of the place, the aforementioned Miskito, Sumu and Rama. Thus, Sumo and Rama are zambos. While the Miskito are a mixture of bawinkas Amerindians, Africans, zambos (sumos ‚Äútawahkas‚Äù), and European.Sergio Ram√≠rez y las ra√≠ces africanas de Centroam√©rica (in Spanish: Sergio Ram√≠rez and the African roots of Centroamerica) = Creoles = They are mostly descendants of former slaves from Jamaica, who arrived in the region to early 19th century, when the region was a British protectorate and retained a rich indigenous culture. That is, are Creoles. The Nicaraguan Creole received from the English, their language, their religion and customs. Of old, the coastal rebutted the inability of the rest of Nicaraguans (Pacific) to understand their cultural identity, and although desde 1987 the Caribbean has a different territorial system (RAAN and RAAS), many sectors still consider themselves neglected by the central state and not yet given a move back legal, political, economic, religious and cultural life of the Caribbean Coast to the rest of Nicaragua.Bluefields Radios . = Garifuna = They live in the country's coasts. They are a mixture of Carib Amerindians and Afro-Caribbeans of the Saint Vicente island (unlike the Creoles), from where they were exported to the island of Roatan, Honduras, because rebelled them against the English domain of the island. From there, they migrated to the Honduran coast, from where they spread to the rest of the Central American coast to Costa Rica. The Garifuna came to the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua in 1832 with the same objectives that motivated since its installation in the continental America (after the wreck of the slave ship in 1636 near the island of St. Vincent in the Lesser Antilles): fighting for his land, be recognized as ethnic and preserve their cultural identity. However, the Garifuna were met with fierce opposition from the Miskito, as indigenous of this territories, and of Black Creole, who forced to them to accept English as the language for business transactions and a half for insertion and recognition in society, according to research on ethnicity in the Caribbean Nicaraguan, of Silvio Araica Aguilar and Cleopatra Morales (May, 2000). The authors report that \\"the major contradictions between Creole and Garifuna, despite having the same ancestors African origin lies in the genealogy of its ethnic composition and thus the result of cultural syncretism\\" (May, 2000).

Nicaraguan coasts: a distinct region The African slaves arrives to Nicaraguan Coast during the British commercial and political domain of the Nicaraguan coast (1524-1821), many of which were exported by the British themselves (except the Creoles). In 1860 Great Britain and the United States sign a treaty, because international negotiations between the two countries developed. So, from 1894, England, abandons gradually the Caribbean coast, delivering in 1905, the territory to American companies, occupying the latter will last until 1930. After British withdrawal, on the Caribbean coast, it remains for 44 years as an autonomous region of Nicaragua, having its own laws and regulations until 1894, when President Jos√© Santos Zelaya said the reintegration of Moskitia to Nicaragua, developing monopolies for mestizos in the area and to U.S. interests, as well as replacing the name of the Mosquito Coast by the Department of Zelaya. Beyond this, the government encouraged a massive immigration of Nicaraguan mestizos, especially those engaged in military affairs, commercial, speculative and entrepreneurs. Immigrants and Nicaraguan government officials evicted from their lands to the indigenous Amerindians and Afro-descendants living in them and imposed heavy fines on the natives of the coast. In addition, the government abolished the laws of the region and built the Nicaraguan government institutions and structures, forming schools, police, government etc. This imposition of that such institutions were built, was made through the use of force. The most important result was the prohibition of education in English and their own languages, only languages spoken by the population - indigenous population, Garifuna and Afro descendants- of this Nicaraguan area. It caused an abandonment of schools and colleges of the coast for generations. The Nicaraguan coast always remained economically dominated by American companies until the 1930s when U.S. companies were gradually replaced by capital of Somoza family and its allies until 1979 with the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution. In 1987, the Caribbean coast achieved autonomy from Nicaragua.

Nova Scrimia is currently represented in Italy and other European countries, in USA and in Mexico. The methods proposed start from the one described by Fiore dei Liberi in his 1410 treatise Flos Duellatorum in Armis et sine Armis, (also known as \\"Fior di Battaglia\\" (The flower of Battle)). Nova Scrimia teaching follows the rich and uninterrupted literature of Italian fencing and direct teachings and lineage of the Italian fencing Masters of dueling, self-defense and sport combat fencing methods and schools (swords, sticks, daggers/knives, unarmed). The curriculum is divided into modern methods and historical schools, both are studied and practiced for contemporary applications and current use in competitive fighting, dueling and defense. The methods include the use of medieval and renaissance swords, the 19th century dueling swords (spada e sciabola da duello o da terreno), different stick and dagger methods and hand-to-hand combat (based on grappling and striking methods, ancient boxing and wrestling methods and free hand fencing). All these fencing methods are always characterized to be a \\"scherma accompagnata\\", meaning a kind of fencing that always actively uses both hands, with or without a weapon (sword and dagger, two swords, sword and buckler, sword and cape, dagger and cape, two sticks, two daggers, etc.) and in any case it always makes use of the unarmed hand in an active fencing strategy, as if it is a second weapon, a typical characteristic of the Italian school of fencing. All methods, united by the same framework of the art and science of fencing, are practiced for combat and for self-defense. The Nova Scrimia Group was established in 1990 and founded officially in 1999 in Italy to research and to experiment with the Italian heritage of combat arts. Scrimia is a Renaissance Italian term meaning ‚Äúfencing‚Äù, so the group's name can be translated as \\"New Fencing\\". The founder group (or brotherhood) was enriched over time by experts, professionals and passionate people with different expertise: academic, scientific or historical background and curricula; people who brought and contributed with different Italian fencing traditions, people with solid different martial art curricula. Nova Scrimia Research Group is a collective and collegial work developed to preserve, protect, promote and actualize the Italian Martial Art tradition. Nova Scrimia Italian Martial Art school is based on: preserving the specific fencing principles (like geometry, anatomy and physics); following the science of fencing evolved in Italy and the efficacy of the Art collected and transmitted by the teaching over centuries of duels and battles; maintaining the specific Italian attitude and culture of the dueling and of the fighting that characterize the Art; and finally adapting, at the same time, to the needs, knowledge, culture and technology of the present time. The Nova Scrimia group has collected many treatises and documents since its birth resulting in a rich ex libris collection. The work of the Nova Scrimia research and development resulted in several publications, articles and books , videos and DVDs . Nova Scrimia has been cited and included or participated in extensive production of publications, websites , documentaries and videos, such as \\"L'arte di Dar Contraria\\", an independent production directed by Roberto Totola internationally from the historical and modern fencing context [ to the Mixed Martial Art field, with citations in books such as \\"Into the Cage: the rises of UFC nation\\" by Nick Gullo and \\"Conceptual Modern Arnis\\" by Bran Frank . Nova Scrimia organizes tournaments and competitions in stickfighting, sword fighting and dagger fighting in many Italian cities. A few of the specialties taught or researched by Nova Scrimia are: * Unarmed or ‚ÄúAbracar‚Äù from techniques of the 15th and 16th century according to Masters Fiore dei Liberi, Filippo Vadi and Achille Marozzo * Two handed Staff according to the school of Master Cerri (19th century), which employs techniques similar to the two handed sword * Walking stick according to the system of Master Martinelli (20th century) * Cornoler stick fighting according to the Venetian School of the 15th and 16th century * Rondel dagger following the systems of Master Fiore dei Liberi and Master Filippo Vadi * Dagger and Cape according to Master Achille Marozzo from the 16th century * Hand-and-a-half sword - 15th century following the systems of Masters Fiore dei Liberi and Filippo Vadi * Side- sword according to the teachings of Masters Manciolino, Marozzo, Agrippa and Dall'Agocchie (16th century) * Striscia (Rapier) according to the schools of Masters Docciolini,Capoferro, Giganti, Alfieri and Fabris (17th century) * Dueling sabre (Sciabola da Terreno) from the systems of Masters Radaelli, Cerri, Lambertini, Viti and Falciani * Free hand Italian boxing and wrestling for self-defence and combat from the ancient pugilato venetico (venetian boxing) to systems of Masters Carmine, Cougnet and others (19th century).

They descended from Africans, who were enslaved from the West Indies and identified as Garifunas and Creole peoples. The Creole people were originally from Jamaica and other Caribbean islands, while the Garifuna people were originally from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Garifunas arrived in the late seventeen hundreds and the Creole peoples arrived during the eighteen hundreds.  Population  Afro-Honduran are Hondurans of African descent. They are estimated to be 10% population of the country. Those brought during colonial times mixed with Indians and Spanish, the Garifuna, and the Bay Island Creoles.  History  Banner at Carnival de La Ceiba One of the first African slaves who arrived in Honduras, Juan Bardales, participated in the Spanish conquest of the province, especially in Trujillo. Shortly thereafter, Berdales was awarded with his freedom. In Honduras, slaves played an important role in the mining industry. Many of them came from Africa, from places like Angola or Senegambia, while others came from the Caribbean. In 1542, 165 slaves came via Portugal and 150 from Santo Domingo. Del olvido a la memoria (in Spanish: From oblivion to memory) In Honduras, were imported slaves Mandinka kangkurao of the Gambia River in Senegambia.Bound To Africa ‚Äî The Mandinka Legacy In The New World By the mid-sixteenth century, between 1000 and 1500 enslaved blacks worked in the gold washings of Olancho, slaves who possibly hailed from Africa. In Honduras, for 1590, arrived in Olancho and at Rio Guayape three hundred Africans for work in mining. A crew of Angolas worked in the mines and businesses in San Miguel. Although many mulattoes and browns also worked in Tegucigalpa for the same dates. Between 1750 and 1779, a larger group of African slaves, Carabali and mondongos (a Kongo tribe) people, were taken to Honduras to build the military fort San Fernando de Omoa, the most important in the region. In 1796, approximately 300 \\"French black\\" from the French colony of Saint Domingue came to Trujillo, in the context of the conflict that gave rise to the independence of Haiti. In 1797, the British exported between 2,000 and 4,000 Black Caribs - mixture of Carib Indians and African Blacks - to the island o Roat√°n in Honduras, because they rebelled against them on the island St. Vincent. After this, these Garifuna, as called themselves, migrated to Trujillo and from there, scattered along the coasts of all the Central American mainland until Costa Rica (without reaching this place), especially by the persecutions to which they were subjected by the Spanish authorities. Some of them were involved in the civil wars of the time. In the late eighteenth century records tell of significant percentages of blacks and mulattoes in Tegucigalpa. But at the end of the colonial period, slaves were already mainly mulattoes. Between the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century, the British introduced black slaves from Jamaica, Cayman Island and Belize in Honduras.LOS NEGROS INGLESES, O CREOLES DE HONDURAS: ETNOHISTORIA, RACISMO, NACIONALISMO Y CONSTRUCCI√ìN DE IMAGINARIOS NACIONALES EXCLUYENTES EN HONDURAS (in Spanish: BLACKS English, or Creoles OF HONDURAS: ETHNOHISTORY, racism, nationalism and exclusionary national IMAGINARY CONSTRUCTION IN HONDURAS). Posted by Dr. Jorge Alberto Amaya. Retrieved January 30, 2013, to 14:20 pm. According to Luis Pedro Taracena, in these years, Tegucigalpa was populated by 80% mulattoes and this percentage was increasing over time, at least until 1815 (when they were 86% of the population). During the twentieth century, mulattoes and browns were progressively neutralized under the category of \\"Ladino\\". According to historian Marbin Barahona, racial mixture enters blacks with whites and Amerindians occurred since the 1520s, due to the decline of the indigenous population, the Spanish immigration scanty and meager arrival of African slaves. The recovery of the hegemony of silver and indigo, the prohibition of non-indigenous groups live in Indian villages and the population growth recorded in the same century, miscegenation, primarily among Amerindian and Spanish, not only increased significantly at this time but concentrated in certain regions, especially in the current Francisco Moraz√°n Department, and Choluteca and Comayagua departments. These departments attracted all kinds of mixed race (mestizo, mulatto, pardo, Ladino, etc.), unlike the indigenous concentration departments west. In 1775, lived in San Fernando de Omoa between 300 and 400 Africans and about 75 white families. They remained there until the early nineteenth century. So, in the late eighteenth century, the Spanish origin population would have been a minority compared to the racially mixed populations (\\"Ladino\\"). The Spanish Crown considered to Ladinos as those subjects of the Crown, originally non- Hispanics, and they learned the official languages of the empire or Vulgar Latin. In the Americas the Ladinos were often identified as those groups nonwhites who were Amerindian or Spanish - speaking (and most people who were not white or Amerindians in the Americas at the time were mestizos and Afro descendants), including possibilities such as \\"black ladino,\\" \\"mulatto Ladin\\", etc. According to Barahona, Ladinos were the majority of the population in 1800 (60% of the population). Because these days, most African - Hondurans were mulatto, sambo and browns. Although in the seventeenth century, had five categories in the census of Spanish America, \\"white\\", \\"Indians\\", \\"mestizos\\", \\"black\\" and \\"mulatto\\", already in the eighteenth century, the last three categories alone in a bind: \\"Ladino\\". During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the Spanish authorities considered Honduran even entire regions populated mostly as mulatto, sambo or brown. Such is the case of places like Olancho, Yoro, Colon and Atl√°ntida, regions that eventually could have remixed with whites, Amerindians and mestizos. It was in the early nineteenth century when slavery was abolished in Honduras and after 1820 the Afro-Hondurans were simply considered citizens and obtained the rights of any citizen to be excluded from the category of \\"free blacks\\" perhaps because the General Francisco Ferrera, Honduran politician who was part of the government of Honduras at the time, had ancestors mulattoes. Anyway, he decreed the expulsion of the country's Garifuna (but ultimately this is not carried out). The Honduran historian, Antonio Canelas Diaz says that by the year 1870, was organized in the city of La Ceiba - the point where, emerged on a large scale banana production in Honduras - a company called \\"New Orleans and Bay Island Company\\" whose executives, imported the first black Creoles hired by fruit, since they were a labor\\" [...] more qualified than the Honduran \\"in banana cultivation, and who had previously worked in their respective nations that sector. Other black anglophone contingents arrived in Honduras with the arrival of black workers from Jamaica and other English-speaking islands arrived to work for the banana transnationals. In 1931, the Alfonso Guillen Zelaya Honduran intellectual, raised the huge black presence on the north coast and the fear that if increased which what he called the \\"black import\\" Honduras ended up being a country of mulatto, however, already then, the country was mostly mestizo and indigenous population had been growing over the years.  Demography  The African Cultural legacy is evident in some places of Honduras. In Trujillo held certain dance parties, whose dancers carry specific masks. Both the dance and the masks are of Mandinka kangkurao origin. In addition to the Afro-Hondurans that descended of slaves imported by the Spanish, there others two Afro communities in Honduras, also present en Nicaragua y Guatemala: Creoles and Garifuna. = Creoles = British blacks or Creoles arrived originally with the introduction of enslaved African to Jamaica, Cayman and Belize by the British during the late eighteenth and mid- nineteenth century who later arrived in Honduras. Creoles also arrived with the immigration of black workers from Jamaica, Cayman island, Trinidad and Tobago and other English-speaking islands, arrived in the early twentieth century to work in transnational banana companies, workers in the construction of railways, dockworkers and in some cases \\"scabs\\", are concentrated mainly in the Bay Islands, especially the Roatan Island and Guanaja and some Caribbean coastal Honduran cities like Puerto Cortes, Tela and La Ceiba. In the 2000s, some Creoles have migrated to the major cities of Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula and other urban centers in the interior. Like the Garifuna, many work as sailors and emigrated to the United States or Grand Cayman Island with which there are strong trade and cultural relations. Over time, blacks brought by the British were learning the customs and the English language, which managed to keep up today. Like white citizens, long blacks were not considered as Hondurans. Although the Bay Islands were eventually recognized as Honduran territory by the British in 1861, by the Treaty \\"Wike-Cross\\", in 1904, people still continued to believe that these lands were English possessions. Even in the 1930s, during the dictatorship of Gen. Tiburcio Carias (19331949), many islanders be Honduran nationals refused, and still clinging to their English traditions, practicing the Protestant religion and speaking only English. As shown, this process represents the first contingent of blacks settled in British Honduras, which was a result of the transfer of slaves from the British to the Bay Islands and some places of the Honduran coast between the late eighteenth and mid-century. Over time, the black English, originally came with the illusion of wealth and then return to their countries, they fell in Honduras and evidently were acquiring some Honduran customs, but in essence, they brought many manifestations of their lands, as religion, music, traditions and language in many cases, are still preserved and that makes therefore constitute a distinct ethnic group from the rest of the Honduran population, however, naturally feel today Hondurans and, in fact, a major instances by which have been \\"integrating\\" the Honduran has been through sport. Indeed, many black British have been in recent decades some major national athletes, especially in football clubs and the national team of Honduras, but also have excelled in other sports such as athletics, baseball and basketball. Finally, many black British, before the decline of the banana industry and the emergence of other productive sectors, were emigrating from the 1950s to the United States and enrolled as marine commercial fishing fleets throughout the Caribbean. Currently, it is estimated that the number of black English or Creole is around 32,000 people. = Garifunas = In 1797, the British exported between 2,000 and 4,000 Black Caribs - mixture of Carib Indians and Black Africans - to the island of Roat√°n in Honduras, because they rebelled against them on the island St. Vincent. While the British ships that carried to Black Caribes to the island addressed her, the Spanish captured one of the British ships, bringing it to Trujillo, Honduras where the Garifunas were released. In addition, the Spanish captured others 1,700 Garifunas on the island of Roatan and they taken him to Trujillo where they lacked manpower, the Garifuna people were regarded as skillful for crops, so they went to work and prospered enough in Trujillo, some of these were recruited by the Spanish army where they served with distinction.

It is this migration that is celebrated annually on November 19 as Garifuna Settlement Day, and is the largest celebration of this community. Some of them were involved in the civil wars of the time. During the twentieth century, some Garifuna have worked on American and British boats during World War II and traveled by the world. As a result of these trips, there are now Garifuna small communities in Los Angeles, New Orleans and New York City who send monthly remittances to Honduras worth $360,000. The Garifuna culture is very strong, with great emphasis on music, dance and history. They have their own religion, the Dugu, consisting of a mixture of Catholicism and African and Caribbean beliefs. Today the Garifuna in Honduras struggling not to be deprived of their lands on the coast for tourism enterprises and try to keep their customs and culture at all costs. Garifuna music, Punta (tip), is a very rhythmic music, accompanied by fast-paced sensual dance with a lot of hip movement. This music has been released recently by bands mostly Hondurans, including the most famous: Kazabe, Garifuna Kids, Banda Blanca, Silver Star and los Roland. Especially the song Sopa de Caracol, of Kazabe has popularized this music internationally.

Background and recording  Hurt had made commercial recordings for the now-defunct Okeh Records in 1928; these did not sell well, and he drifted back into obscurity in southern Mississippi. In 1952, Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, which contained two tracks by Hurt, was released. As well as this, a man had discovered a copy of Hurt's \\"Avalon Blues\\", which gave the name of Hurt's home town, Avalon, Mississippi. In 1963, Tom Hoskins and Richard Spotswood, two folk enthusiasts, located him in Avalon using the song. Hoskins convinced him to move to Washington, D.C., where there would be plenty of opportunities to perform to an increasing folk audience.Dahl, Bill. Liner notes to D. C. Blues: The Library of Congress Recordings, Vol. 1. Fuel 2000 Records. 1998. There, he made his first post-war recordings, which were released on the Gryphon label as Folk Songs and Blues. Hurt was invited to perform at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963, where he was greeted as a \\"living legend\\". Following this performance, he began to tour around various universities, and recorded a second album in 1964. Through touring, Hurt's audience continued to grow, which prompted a recording contract with Vanguard Records and the release of his third album, Today!, in 1966. A similar recording and performance schedule was adopted by the fellow bluesman Skip James around this same time, who also recorded for Vanguard an album of the same name.Wynn, Ron.

They can be found in Camba Cua outside Asuncion; Kamba Kokue outside Paraguari, and the city of Emboscada.King, Stewart R. \\"Paraguay.\\" Encyclopedia of Free Blacks and People of Color in the Americas, Stewart R. King, Facts On File, 1st edition, 2012. Credo Reference, https://login.avoserv2.library.fordham.edu/login?url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/foffree/paraguay/0?institutionId=3205. Accessed 23 Oct. 2019. Currently, the Afro-Paraguayan population accounts for 1% of the total population.  History  The first African slaves arrived at Paraguay in 1556.Noticias: La otra historia (in Spanish: News: The other story) The majority of the slaves were of Nigerian and Angolan origin, similar to other black slaves arriving in South American from the slave trade. According to Argentine historian Jos√© Ignacio Telesca, the slaves that entered legally came from the slave ports of Buenos Aires, Montevideo and C√≥rdoba, while those that entered illegally came from Brazil. The Spanish explorer Pedro de Mendoza - who reached the Rio de Plata in the 16th century and was appointed its viceroy - brought enslaved Africans to Paraguay. According to the Telesca, more than 4% of the population were slaves in colonial times, keeping the same percentage in the 19th century after independence.Historia de esclavos en el Paraguay (in Spanish: History of slaves in Paraguay) However, according to the Kamba Cu√° \\"Afro-Paraguayan Association\\", in 1782, the black population represented 11.2 percent of the total population of the then Province of Paraguay. This population continued to increase according to Telesca, and by 1811 half of the Paraguayan population was of African descent, whether slave or free.Ultima hora: \\"En 1811, la mitad de la poblaci√≥n paraguaya era afrodescendiente\\". Retrieved December 3, 2012. written by Cristian Cantero. Editorial √öltima Hora So, several towns like Aregua, Emboscada (in English: \\"Ambush\\"), and Guarambare were established as black communities. With the arrival of Artigas' also arrived, curiously, people of Kamba ethnicity, a Kenyan ethnic group, from Uruguay, who settled in Paraguay in the 1820s.Info Zuque. com. Se los llama Kamba Kua (in Spanish: They are call Kamba Kua). They arrived in a regiment of 250 spearmen, men and women, who accompanied General Jose Gervasio Artigas, the revolutionary leader of the now Uruguay, in his exile in Paraguay. The Kamba Cua were dispossessed of their land by General Higinio Morinigo in the 1940s. Of his 100 hectares, they stayed with 3 hectares.  Demography  Although according to official estimates, the Afro-Paraguayan population accounts for 2% of the total population, the Afro Paraguayan Association Kamba Cu√°, supported by the Department of Statistics, Surveys and Censuses (Dgeec) and the U.S. and state IAF, estimated the number of Afro-Paraguayan people at only 8,013, equivalent to 0.13 percent of the 6.1 million inhabitants of Paraguay. This census indicates specifically that there are 422 people in Kamba Cua, 385 people in Kamba Koku√©, and more than 7,000 people in Emboscada: 2,686 in urban areas and 4,524 in rural areas and 58% of the total population are of African descent.Otra Am√©rica: comunidades afroparaguayas condenadas a no existir (in Spanish: Another America: communities afroparaguayas sentenced to absence) So, of the total of African descent, 5.6 percent live in Kamba Cu√°, 4.9 percent in Kamba Kokue and 89.5 percent in Emboscada. The census also shows that they are virtually matched for sex and they have a predominantly young population: 63% at that time was under 30 years old. All those of African descent speak Guarani, like the rest of the Paraguayans. The illiteracy rate stands at 7.4%, and of that percentage, 58% are women. The number of people who have come to attend the first through to sixth grade accounted for 60% and those who have reached university level only 1%. Note that the results are unofficial and incomplete since the census did not reach all residents, especially in Emboscada; additionally, some residents surveyed did not self-identify as being of African descent, separate from other groupings of Afro-Paraguayans and individuals of African descent throughout the country that were not included in the census. As already mentioned, there are three communities of Afro-Paraguayan: the Kamba Cu√°, in the Central Department (outside Asuncion), Kamba Kokue, meaning \\"chacra de negros\\" (farm of blacks) in Guarani language, and is situated in the Paraguar√≠ Department, and Emboscada, in the Cordillera Department. The three communities are in the eastern region. The origins of these settlements date back to the Spanish colonial period. Kamba Cu√° is the place having the most important Afro-Paraguayan community. This place, in the Central Department, is populated by so-called Artiga's Cue -or \\"black of Kamba Cu√°\\"-, which are descended from the Kamba people (a Kenyan ethnic group). They arrived in Paraguay as members of a regiment of 250 spearmen, men and women, who accompanied General Jose Gervasio Artigas, the independence¬¥s leading revolutionary of the Eastern Band (the current Uruguay) in his exile in Paraguay in 1820. After having arrived in Asunci√≥n, they settled in the Campamento Loma area, practicing dairy and secondary agriculture. However, in the 1940s, they were dispossessed of their land by General Higinio Morinigo. Of his 100 hectares, they stayed with 3 hectares. However, the community survived, kept his chapel and dances, created a football club (\\"Jan Six-ro\\"), and one school of drum and dance for children. His ballet is the only Afro- Paraguayan expression, and premiered at the Folk Festival peach \\"Uruguay Yi sings in\\" 1992, where it won the \\"Golden charr√∫a\\". Their original lands at Campamento Loma remained vacant, and Kamba Cu√° recently occupied them and planted manioc, but by the government decision of Was mosy (postStroessner), were accused of being \\"terrorists\\" and were beaten and evicted. Today, according to official estimates, about 300 families (between 1,200 and 2,500 people) live in Kumba Cu√°. However, according to censuses of the Afro- Paraguayan Association Kamba Cu√°, this community consists of only 422 people. Religion is an integral part of daily life. Currently they are Catholic. His saint is San Benito of Palermo and King San Baltazar, who came from Uruguay. Their main festival is celebrated on 6 January each year at the community's social club named after the patron saint. The important ballet artistic expressions of the Kamba Kua and culinary arts of this community have been maintained for nearly 180 years. Their oral tradition recalls that many of them participated and died in the defensive war against the Triple Alliance (1865‚Äì69), which destroyed Paraguay. They keep memories of their history, passed down from generation to generation, hold dances like \\"candombe\\", dedicated to San Baltasar, and drumming. So, this community is the best known of African descent in Paraguay for having preserved their identity and culture, promoted through its traditional festivals.La Comunidad Afro Paraguaya Kamba Kua (the Afro-Paraguayan community Kamba Kua Emboscada (in Spanish: \\"Ambush\\"), a city that now has about 14,000 inhabitants, was founded in 1740 under the name of \\"Emboscada de Pardos Libres \\"(Free Pardo's ambush), because it was a point of frequent ambushes and because early settlers were 500 brown (black and mestizos) freedmen. Kamba Kokue, in the Paraguar√≠ Department, was also founded by black communities, from ranches of slaves of the religious missionaries of the Catholic Society of Jesus, better known as the Jesuit order. Also towns or villages as Aregua, Emboscada, and Guarambar√© were established as black communities.  Year of African descent  The United Nations declared 2011 the International Year of People of African Descent in order to strengthen national policies and international cooperation for the benefit of this group to achieve, in theory, the satisfaction of all their rights, their participation, and integration in all political, economic, social and cultural aspects of society, and promote greater understanding and respect for the diverse heritage and culture of these people. In this context in Paraguay has been developing the tour of a show called \\"Negritud de colores\\" (Negritude Colors) that runs different cities. It is a show of Afro- Latin American music and dance scene that rises to 25 artists to develop a wide repertoire of songs, chants, and dances with rescued African roots of this continent. The Paraguayan singer Mariv√≠ Vargas, the team of musicians and a group of drummers and dancers Kamba Cua led by Lazaro Medina offer a show that aims to bring African culture and make visible the collective African descent. Showing and themes from Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, Mexico and Cuba and of course of Paraguay, with the presentation of the galloping \\"San Baltasar\\" and \\"Kamba la Merce,\\" a rich description of the dances related popular culture, plus rhythms Kamba Cua group like-Pitiki Guarimba pitiki and gallops.

It began with the founder, Dave Stein, growing frustrated that he couldn't legally publish or share live DJ sets online which he was experiencing at parties. Therefore, Dubset.com created a proprietary technology, MixSCAN, that allows tracks being sampled within a mix to be properly fingerprinted and reported for rights flow purposes. This allowed the site to position itself as one of the first compliant services for streaming DJ mixed content. The technology itself piqued the interest of many, which in turn opened new business lines and opportunities for Dubset. The platform received an initial $500,000 in seed funding from Governing Dynamics VC and various other angels. After a year of operating as Dubset.com, there was a shift towards rebranding in order to advance the features of the platform, as well as to help clear up the confusion surrounding the phonetic similarities between both the name of the site and the popular dance genre dubstep. The Future FM created an Indiegogo campaign in the beginning of 2013 in order to take the next step in the development of their MixSCAN technology. Since then, The Future FM has revamped their brand design, site and overall features. Some of these features include, embeddable and social media players, in which notable artists have begun using such as, David Guetta, Ti√´sto and Afrojack. Technology The proprietary technology, MixSCAN, serves as the backbone of the platform by allowing DJs to upload and stream their mix content compliantly. MixSCAN is Dubset Media's music identification and rights resolution technology. All mix content is run through MixSCAN, which consists of a three-step process of audio fingerprinting, textual fingerprinting and final oversight by Dubset production engineers. Once the mix content has completed the process, a unique MixDNA is then assigned to the mix which consists of metadata surrounding the sampled tracks. Features The Future FM offers DJs unlimited mix uploads to their custom channels. Select DJs and mixes are published on the homepage to be prominently featured to listeners. Mixes can also be distributed virtually anywhere via either an embeddable widget and/or Facebook player. Video pre- roll advertisements are served in front of mix content in order to ensure that the underlying rights holders are paid (on behalf of the DJ) for their sampled work. The platform and technology serve as a medium to connect DJs with brands, such as Lindsay Luv and Victoria Secret, Smirnoff's Master of the Mix show on VH1, etc. Brands are able to create custom skinned channels to host and share original mixes directly associated with their brand. DJs are able to review their royalty earnings by enrolling into The Future FM 'Royalty Program'.

Argyll Ferries Ltd was a ferry company formed in January 2011 by the Scottish Governments department of Transport Scotland via the parent company David MacBrayne Ltd to tender for the Dunoon (Cowal Peninsula) to Gourock public service route. Argyll Ferries were announced as the preferred bidder at the end of May 2011, contracts were exchanged on 7 June 2011 for the service, the service then commenced 23 days later on 30 June 2011. The Argyll Ferries service has suffered from cancellations due to technical problems, or limitations of the small vessels in unfavourable weather. When this occurs, the ferry company provides a relief bus service taking passengers from Gourock railway station and pierhead to their destination via the Western Ferries Hunters Quay to McInroy's Point ferry. In winter since 2016, the larger CalMac ferry MV Coruisk is redeployed to Gourock for peak sailings, and provides a relief service when conditions are too severe for the smaller boats. From 21 January 2019 the Argyll Ferries service was transferred by Transport Scotland into the existing Caledonian MacBrayne Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service contract, continuing with the same staff and boats. CalMac branding was introduced over the following months, and Transport Scotland were to reconsider vessel and service requirements at some stage. Fleet arriving at Gourock, on the Argyll Ferries service from Dunoon. Argyll Ferries Ltd operates two passenger vessels on the route, and . Both are leased from their owner Caledonian Maritime Assets. Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) had previously run the on a 9-year lease from Isle of Wight Cruises but she was bought outright for the new service. The , formerly the ten-year- old Irish ferry, Banr√≠on Chonamara, was purchased specifically for the new service. When the service began on 30 June 2011, preparation of the Argyll Flyer had been held up by broken rear prop shafts. As an interim measure the cruise boat was leased from Clyde Cruises to start the service. She suffered breakdowns during the first day, then continued in interim service alongside the other two ferries for a short period. In the past, ferries operated by Caledonian MacBrayne have provided additional support on the route; notably the during the Cowal Gathering in August 2011 and the in December 2013. Route MV Argyll Flyer and Caledonian MacBrayne car ferry MV Coruisk on standby at Gourock Pier in February 2017 while Gourock‚ÄìDunoon sailings were suspended due to adverse weather. The service operates between a vehicle linkspan at the breakwater in Dunoon town centre and a vehicle linkspan in Gourock town centre immediately adjacent to Gourock rail terminal. Regular trains to Glasgow Central via Paisley are available from the train station. Dunoon is located on the Cowal Peninsula. The service by Argyll Ferries saves journey time as the road route along Loch Eck (A815 road) side, Rest and be thankful (A83 road) and Loch Lomond (A82 road) side, is a far longer journey. Contract A previous report by Deloitte Touche on options for the route stated that, for a passenger only service, \\"Large hulls are required to suit Upper Clyde water, but the vessels would be fitted out to accommodate only 150 people, which would meet the requirements of passenger traffic on most days of the year.\\" Concerns were expressed about the suitability of these small boats in rough weather. However a spokesman for the parent company of the ferry operators, David MacBrayne Ltd, gave assurances that the ferries were suitable, and would have the advantage of using the new sheltered berth at Dunoon instead of the old pier which is more exposed. February 2017; \\"sailings suspended due to swell conditions at Dunoon pier, replacement buses being organised.\\" The service is operated under a Public Service Contract produced by Transport Scotland, a department of the Scottish Government. The contract permits sailings that fail to take place due to safety considerations including adverse weather to be counted as if they had sailed for the purposes of reliability under the contract, subject to due diligence to minimise such delays. The contract also permits each boat to have two weeks per year of scheduled maintenance therefore, since there is no provision for relief vessels, a half service operates for at least four weeks each year. Performance Updates West Coast Motors bus; \\"Argyll Ferries Replacement Service\\" via Western Ferries. In November 2011 the service suffered 88 weather-related cancellations, with 138 such cancellations in December. Figures indicated cancellation or disruption of 3.6% of sailings since July. In response to complaints from passengers, the Scottish Government cabinet secretary Alex Neil said the service was \\"not fit for purpose\\" and said he had asked the company to produce an improvement plan. In March 2012 Argyll Ferries announced performance figures for February and March. They stated that the service had been very reliable contractually, showing good punctuality, and said that passenger numbers were beginning to increase. In April the service cancelled 99 sailings Weather and technical failures continue to be problematic in 2014, 2015, and 2016, with continued numerous service cancellations.

Amalgamation June 2019 ‚Äì Argyll Flyer now in CalMac livery. From 12 November 2019 Ali Cat was also in CalMac livery. At the end of 2018 Transport Scotland decided to incorporate the Argyll Ferries service into the existing Caledonian MacBrayne Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service contract, the transition took place on 21 January 2019. There would be no immediate changes to the service which was to continue with the same staff and boats, uniforms and livery of the boats would change to CalMac branding at a future date to minimise disruption.

In the 1940s, he and Eli Woods appeared in his father's variety act, known as Jimmy James and Co. After retiring from the BBC in the 1980s, he resurrected the act and toured the surviving variety theatres performing it with Woods for the following twenty five years. His most notable discoveries during his career at BBC Radio in Manchester, between 1954 and 1982, were the radio comedian Jimmy Clitheroe, the comedian Les Dawson, the comedian Ken Dodd, and the comedy double-act known professionally as Hinge and Bracket, each of whom he launched into a career in radio light entertainment with their own BBC series. His most successful series for BBC Radio was creating, producing and co-writing The Clitheroe Kid, starring the diminutive comic Jimmy Clitheroe, which ran continuously for sixteen years on the BBC Light Programme and BBC Radio 2, running from 1957 to 1972 inclusive, based on a chance meeting with Jimmy Clitheroe on a Variety bill in 1952. During the Second World War he served in the ranks in the Royal Armoured Corps from 1941 and as an officer in the Durham Light Infantry from 1944, landing on the Normandy beaches on D-Day with the 9th Battalion DLI in 1944. He was interviewed at length about his wartime experiences by the Imperial War Museum as part of their Durham Light Infantry oral history project.  Biography  James Casey, born in 1922 at Stockton-on-Tees in England, was the son of the variety comedian Jimmy James. While his two children were still young, he moved to London; but within a couple of years his wife's favourite aunt was taken seriously ill, and the family moved to Liverpool to take care of her. It was here Casey began writing comedy for the BBC's Light Entertainment Department, submitting scripts to BBC Radio's North Region under the pen name Cass James (which was, at that time, his usual stage name). These were such a success that he would spend the next 26 years commuting between Crosby on Merseyside and BBC Broadcasting House in Manchester. In the spirit of the theatre, James Casey was metaphorically born in a trunk, and lived literally in a wicker basket whilst his father and mother performed on stage, one of them looking after him in the wings or in the dressing room while the other was performing a few feet away. If they were both on stage together, he was simply left in his basket in the wings. As he grew older, however, he was not allowed a speaking part in the act, because his father wanted him to become a lawyer rather than go on the stage with all its uncertainties. A career in the law was not to be, though, and when he came out of the Army at the end of the war he tried to sort out his father's disastrous financial affairs. Though teetotal, Jimmy James was a compulsive gambler, and went bankrupt three times. On the final occasion on which he faced the bankruptcy court, completely deadpan, he announced to the surprised assembly: \\"I presume I have now won the Official Receiver outright!\\" Before he died in 1965, Jimmy James was earning ¬£275 a week as top of the bill at Skegness; a huge sum for the time. It was during the late 'Forties that James Casey first joined the act, in three- handed sketches: with his father in the centre bouncing gags off him on one side and his cousin, Jack Casey (who originally used the stage name Bretton Woods, but was later better known as Eli Woods), on the other. James junior quickly discovered a greater talent for writing the sketches. So when his father moved into radio, James Casey ended up writing everything, including editions showcasing other comedians: for the radio series Northern Variety Parade, he wrote scripts not only for his father but also for popular comedians such as Norman Evans, for whom Casey wrote Over the Garden Wall style sketches. Jimmy James's radio broadcasts, written by his son, were in radio series such as The Mayor's Parlour and Home James; and, since each series pulled in huge audiences, Casey was offered a staff job as a BBC producer. He also teamed up with Jimmy Clitheroe, who already had film experience and had worked with Jimmy James in Variety. Only 4'3\\" tall, before he became famous Clitheroe played Frank Randle's dummy in ventriloquist sketches, at the end of which he would jump from the fake ventriloquist's knee and run off into the wings to show he wasn't in fact a doll. In 1955, at Casey's prompting, Clitheroe appeared in Call Boy, a radio variety series featuring popular stars of the day including Ted Lune, Margery Manners and Dennis Goodwin. Written mainly by Casey, writing under his stage name 'Cass James', assisted by Frank Roscoe and Ronnie Taylor, the initial sketches featuring Jimmy Clitheroe were short 8-minute items, but within three years had expanded into the full-length situation comedy The Clitheroe Kid, written mainly ‚Äì and produced solely ‚Äì by James Casey, who was now writing and producing under his real name. The combination of Casey's versatile scripts and Jimmy Clitheroe's impetuous cheek proved a winner. Stalwarts Patricia Burke as mother, and Peter Sinclair as grandad, were complemented by Diana Day as Jimmy's older sister Susan (nicknamed \\"Scraggy Neck\\"), her gormless boy friend \\"Daft Alfie\\" played by Danny Ross, and Tony Melody as Mr Higginbottom their rough-hewn neighbour. According to Casey himself, the scripts sometimes arrived too late for any kind of proper rehearsal. Whereas Life with the Lyons had no fewer than eight dry runs, before the ninth performance went out live, the professionals in The Clitheroe Kid had no such luxury. Only rarely, however, did any of them miss a cue or come in early. Nevertheless, they could occasionally be heard stifling a laugh, at Jimmy's preposterous comments or Danny Ross's splutterings as he became tongue-tied and came out with ridiculous statements and gaffes; a sharp cry of \\"Ooh me leg!\\" meant Jimmy had just (pretended to) kick him. Two famous comedians owed their professional careers almost entirely to Casey, who discovered, honed and marketed them. When he spotted Les Dawson in a Manchester club he immediately recognised great talent, but it took five years to persuade the BBC to try him out on radio. When they did, Casey wrote the jokes for Listen with Les for 12 years. When he saw the first scripts, Dawson remarked that they were more like him than he was himself. Casey spotted Ken Dodd at the Sunderland Empire on the same bill as his father, and challenged the BBC's initial assessment that Dodd was suitable only for television. Much later, David Hatch asked James Casey if he would again produce Ken Dodd on radio, as he was the only person the now famous comedian trusted. He did, and Dodd recorded several over-length live shows, which Casey edited, almost non-stop over a period of 24 days, to create the series: the resulting six programmes being a notable success. One difficulty was that Ken Dodd was often up to two hours late for the rehearsals. To combat this, Casey contracted everyone else to turn up at noon, while Dodd was contracted to turn up at 10am. He was still two hours late, so he thought, but now it no longer held up production. However, once he discovered what Casey had done the ploy had to be abandoned. Early finishes rarely happened either. Another successful comedy series Casey produced was Hinge and Bracket, who he initially thought were two genuine old ladies when he first saw their act on tv. It was fellow BBC producer Mike Craig who, highly amused, pointed out that they were actually two young men in drag. The closing credits on the resulting series, which he produced, included a reference to him as Gentleman James Casey, a typically Northern compliment, meaning a genuine gentlemen. A promising Des O'Connor radio series was ruined by the BBC reneging on the promise of a prime weekend timeslot; but Mike Yarwood and the young Morecambe and Wise also profited from Casey's witty scripts. He also worked closely with Eric and Ernie's eventual tv scriptwriter Eddie Braben (in the comedy sketch series The Worst Show on the Wireless ‚Äì in which his son David Casey, and his cousin Eli Woods, also featured), produced Roy Castle on radio in Castle's on the Air (Roy Castle had begun his career, in the 1950s, as a member of Jimmy James and Co in the variety theatres), and he discovered and promoted a young Alison Steadman (also in The Worst Show on the Wireless). In 1982 he retired from the BBC, just before Ken Dodd could ask him to produce yet more radio shows. Upon retiring from radio, Casey revived his father's variety act to great acclaim with Roy Castle and Eli Woods, on The Michael Parkinson Show on BBC television in 1982. As a result of that appearance, they were invited to include the act in that year's Royal Variety Performance. With Woods, Casey then worked the surviving variety theatres with the act for the following 25 years. As a measure of his stature within the profession, many famous stars willingly appeared as the second stooge in the act during those years, including Roy Castle, Ray Alan, Jimmy Cricket, Roy Hudd, Paul Shane, Reg Varney, Les Dawson, Mike Craig, Don McLean, Charlie Williams, Dave Evans, and Johnny Casson.

Between 1996 and 2000, the Taliban government outlawed television, though some stations in areas outside Taliban control continued to broadcast. After their removal, country-wide television broadcasting was resumed beginning with the government-run channel Afghanistan National Television. It was reported that Afghanistan currently has over 200 local and international television channels, 96 in Kabul and 107 in other provinces of the country. In 2014, the country commenced a switched from analog to digital TV transmission. History The state owned Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA) launched the first TV channel in Afghanistan, after the completion of feasibility study under grant aid from Japan, construction work of the studio and transmitter buildings were finished by August 1978. During the 1980s, many Soviet programs were airing such as the children's show Nu Pogodi!. The studios of RTA were also often used by musicians to record music videos. From 1992 onward television went into decline as a result of the war in Kabul, destroying infrastructure. During the Taliban government between 1996 and 2001, television was strictly banned and stores selling TVs, satellite dishes, VCRs, or other similar technology entertainment devices were closed. Anyone owning or watching TV was arrested and punished. The national television broadcaster was closed down, whilst private broadcasters' buildings and studios were smashed by the regime's police. A smaller territory that was controlled by the Northern Alliance in the country's northeast province of Badakhshan had a television channel financed by the Northern Alliance that broadcast, with a weak signal, news and movies to approximately 5,000 people in the city of Fayzabad. The station had a large library of movies and documentaries on VHS and Betamax for broadcasting, and the American movie First Blood was reportedly the most favored by watchers.https://www.standard.co.uk/news/afghan-newsreader-left-in-the- dark-6336148.html When the Karzai administration came to power in December 2001, Afghanistan's earliest television channel was relaunched. Later, Tolo and Shamshad TV became one of the first commercial TV stations in the countryhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/collegeofjournalism/entries/cc23ed0d-2bea-4043-9a19-79523e08143a and laid the foundation for an accessible media outlet by offering a large library of shows. In 2014, Afghanistan launched a pact with Eutelsat for a satellite, which was launched in 2014 as Afghansat 1 and transmits TV channels.https://spacenews.com/39317satellite-to-be-moved-renamed- afghansat-1-under-eutelsat-afghan-pact/ As of 2019, Afghanistan has over 200 local and international television channels, 96 in Kabul and 107 in other provinces of the country. Television ownership and viewership According to The Asia Foundation's report \\"A Survey of the Afghan People in 2016\\", ownership of television is concentrated in urban areas, where electricity is more dependable and corresponds to increased household income. The central region (Kabul) exhibits the highest TV ownership, with 53.3% of households having one TV set, followed closely by the East and South West regions. Nearly two-thirds of Afghans (64.5%) report watching TV programs. Tolo was reported to be the most watched network, followed by Ariana Television Network, Shamshad TV, and Lemar. Another study conducted by Gallup in 2015 found that Tolo was most popular with females, whereas RTA was most popular with males. Weekly TV viewing was highest in the north of the country, lowest in the east.https://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2015/01/Afghanistan-FINAL.pdf =Transmission= In Afghanistan, many people watch TV through traditional analog terrestrial signals using (mostly indoor) antennas. It is the dominant method of watching TV in urban areas. Satellite transmission is much more common in rural areas than urban. Cable rates are low for both urban and rural.https://www.bbg.gov/wp-content/media/2015/01/Afghanistan-FINAL.pdf On January 2013 Afghanistan's Ministry of Communication and Information Technology held a meeting with TV broadcasters on plans to switch from analog to digital transmission systems.

Using a local training methodology, matching students with experienced instructors on a one-on-one basis the Society's hands on approach gained it quick acceptance in New York and eventually throughout the country . This, coupled with quarterly classroom based training, allowed Society members to learn hypnosis through personal interaction with subjects and knowledgeable professionals. The Society offered certification and training recognizing successful students as hypnotists after 200 hours of training and examination and as hypnotherapists after 800 hours of training and 120 hours of supervised client interaction (which time could be accounted against the 800 hours of training). Related class work from a properly accredited institution, such as a college, could be used to offset up to 500 hours of the required class material, if approved by the accreditation panel, but only actual client interaction by a previously certified hypnotherapist could be used for the 120-hour client requirement.Certification Requirements, American Hypnosis Society, As Published 1992, pp3-5 Submission to examinations and demonstrations of accumulated knowledge were required by students at regular intervals during the education process.

The company has showrooms across the United States.  History  Paoli, Inc. was first organized in July 1926 by Samuel Elsby, Sr. as a consolidation of the previous Orleans Cabinet Company and the Paoli Furniture Company. This new organization started out as the Paoli Chair Company and was located in Paoli, Indiana. The main products manufactured were footstools, vanity benches, and dining room suites complete with chairs. When the Great Depression hit, Samuel J Elsby, Jr., who was then serving as the Secretary-Treasurer, suggested creating a line of occasional chairs targeted towards the consumer market. These occasional chairs were successful at the Chicago furniture market show. The company began putting a focus on additional occasional chairs, which in turn, kept Paoli alive through the depression. In 1951, Samuel Elsby, Jr. became president of Paoli Chair Company. By 1954, Paoli employed 300 people and became the largest manufacturer of occasional chairs in the world. Their success continued into the 1960s and led to two plant expansions. Soon after the expansion and modernization was complete, Samuel Elsby, Jr. died at age 60. His sons, Robert Elsby and Sam Elsby III, stepped up to keep the business prospering. Not long after, the family sold the company to two investors named Joseph Wulfman and Sherman Heazlitt. Robert Elsby stayed with the company as President after it was sold, and ran the company until 1986. By the end of the 1970s, Paoli made the switch from the residential chair market to the commercial furniture market. As Paoli contracted with other furniture manufacturers to produce desks, the company purchased property in neighboring Orleans, Indiana to build a warehouse to store the desks. Then in 1982, Paoli began making its own desk and casegoods products at the Orleans site. Because of success in the commercial furniture market, Heazlitt and Wulfman adopted the new name Paoli, Inc. Joseph Wulfman retired and sold his share of Paoli, Inc. to Sherman Heazlitt in 1986. Heazlitt became CEO and Thomas A. Talone became the 5th president of the company. Two years later, Heazlitt sold Paoli, Inc. to Klaussner Furniture Industries of Asheboro, North Carolina. Through the 1990s, the company flourished, expanded, and moved all production and administration to a modern facility built in Orleans, Indiana. In 1999, Paoli, Inc. purchased Whitehall Furniture, an established manufacturer of quality seating. In 2004, Paoli, Inc. was acquired by HNI Corporation, the second largest office furniture manufacturer. From 2007 - 2009, Dave Gardner served as president. Brandon Sieben became president of Paoli, Inc. in January 2010 and served until December 2013 when he re-located to another position within the HNI Corporation, and he now is the acting President of Allsteel, Inc.

Description  Potamolithus rushii was originally described by the American malacologist Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1896. Pilsbry's original text reads as follows: The shell of Potamolithus rushii is imperforate, wider than high, biconvex, very solid and strong. It is light green in color. The last half of the last whorl is dusky green. The keels are rather bright green. The early whorls are being dark reddish brown. The surface is somewhat glossy, with faint, fine growth- lines and barely perceptible spiral lines. The spire is convex, the apex is obtuse. The shell has 4 whorls, but the first whorl is eroded, leaving a pit, in all the adult shells seen. The whorls are convex, with seam-like sutures. In the latter part of the penultimate whorl the peripheral keel is usually visible at the suture. The last whorl has a very strong peripheral keel, the surface is being concave above and below it. Above the concavity the upper surface is convex, the convexity rising into a hump on the back, then disappearing, the last fourth of the whorl being flat. The base has a thick and prominent keel, defining a concave yellowish columellar area. The outer lip has a high, narrow varix at the edge. The aperture is very oblique, short- ovate, nearly circular, with a continuous, black-edged margin. The oblique columella is very broad, with a gutter or concavity near to and parallel with the inner margin. There is some variation in the degree of depression of the whole shell, the amplitude of the columellar area and in the prominence of the hump on the back, which is sometimes almost suppressed. The width of the shell is 6.3 mm. The height of the shell is 4.3-5.1 mm. { umbilical view of an adult shell, type specimen lateral view of an adult shell, type specimen } The relationship between Potamolithus rushii and Potamolithus iheringi is exceedingly interesting. The two species are similar in general color-scheme, in the varix, absence of more rapid descent of the suture towards the mouth, etc., but are totally diverse in contour, the one being carinate, the other smooth and naticoid. Yet it is significant that while Potamolithus iheringi has no trace of a peripheral keel, the green band occupies the same position as that coloring the keel in Potamolithus rushii.  Life cycle  apertural view of a juvenile shell The youngest specimens seen by Pilsbry had three whorls and a diameter of 3 mm. They had the depressed contour of adults and were strongly carinate peripherally, but the carina is distinctly weaker in front of the mouth, apparently indicating that it begins when the shell has nearly two whorls and a diameter of about a millimeter. At the 3 mm stage, the columella is very broad, semicircular, with a deep excavation and rod-like inner border (see image on the right). Very late in the neanic stage the basal keel appears, the shell then being about 5 mm in diameter; the columellar area is very narrow, at first linear. The rib or convexity of the upper surface is also of late appearance, these structures belong to the third neanic substage, the second, or unicarinate, substage thus occupying the greater part of the neanic stage. The discontinuation of the upper ridge or hump initiates the ephebic substage. The marginal varix and the absence of any tendency of the last whorl to descend or loosen its coil anteriorly, show that this species is at its acme. It has none of the stigmata of senility which are so manifest in Potamolithus microthauma, Potamolithus hidalgoi, etc. References This article incorporates public domain text from references Category:Lithoglyphidae Category:Gastropods described in 1896 ","title":"Potamolithus rushii"},{"id":"32086005","text":"Mount Burnham is a mountain in California.

Stomata are small pores on the top and or bottom of a leaf that are responsible for taking in CO2 and expelling water vapour. The rate of stomatal conductance, or its inverse, stomatal resistance, is directly related to the boundary layer resistance of the leaf and the absolute concentration gradient of water vapor from the leaf to the atmosphere. It is under the direct biological control of the leaf through its guard cells, which surround the stomatal pore (Taiz/Zeiger 1991). The turgor pressure and osmotic potential of guard cells is directly related to the stomatal conductance. Stomatal conductance is a function of stomatal density, stomatal aperture, and stomatal size. Stomatal conductance is integral to leaf level calculations of transpiration (E). Multiple studies have shown a direct correlation between the use of herbicides and changes in physiological and biochemical growth processes in plants, particularly non- target plants, resulting in a reduction in stomatal conductance and turgor pressure in leaves.  Light-dependent stomatal opening  Light-dependent stomatal opening occurs in many species and under many different conditions. Light is a major stimulus involved in stomatal conductance, and has two key elements that are involved in the process: the stomatal response to blue light, and photosynthesis in the chloroplast of the guard cell. The stomata open when there is an increase in light, and they close when there is a decrease in light. This is because the blue light activates a receptor on the guard cell membrane which induces the pumping of protons of the cells, which creates an electrochemical gradient. This causes free floating potassium and other ions to enter the guard cells via a channel. The increase in solutes within the guard cells leads to a decrease in the osmotic potential of the cells, causing water to flood in, the guard cell becomes enlarged, and therefore open. The second key element involved in light-dependent stomatal opening is the photosynthesis in the chloroplast of the guard cell. This event also increases the amount of solutes within the guard cell. Carbon dioxide enters the chloroplasts which increases the amount of photosynthesis. This increases the amount of solutes that are being produced by the chloroplast which are then released into the cytosol of the guard cell. Again, this causes a decrease in osmotic potential, water floods into the cells, the cells swell up with water, and the stomata is opened. Recent studies have looked at the stomatal conductance of fast growing tree species to identify the water use of various species. Through their research it was concluded that the predawn water potential of the leaf remained consistent throughout the months while the midday water potential of the leaf showed a variation due to the seasons. For example, canopy stomatal conductance had a higher water potential in July than in October. The studies conducted for this experiment determined that the stomatal conductance allowed for a constant water use per unit leaf area. Other studies have explored the relationship between drought stress and stomatal conductance. Through these experiments, researchers have found that a drought resistant plant regulates its transpiration rate via stomatal conductance. This minimizes water loss and allows the plant to survive under low water conditions. Methods for measuring Stomatal conductance can be measured in several ways: Steady-state porometers: A steady state porometer measures stomatal conductance using a sensor head with a fixed diffusion path to the leaf. It measures the vapor concentration at two different locations in the diffusion path. It computes vapor flux from the vapor concentration measurements and the known conductance of the diffusion path using the following equation: \\\\frac{C_{vL}-C_{v1}}{R_{vs}+R_1}=\\\\frac{C_{v1}-C_{v2}}{R_2} Where C_{vL} is the vapor concentration at the leaf, C_{v1} and C_{v2} are the concentrations at the two sensor locations, R_{vs} is the stomatal resistance, and R_1 and R_2 are the resistances at the two sensors. If the temperatures of the two sensors are the same, concentration can be replaced with relative humidity, giving R_{vs}=\\\\frac{1-h_1}{h_2-h_1}R_2-R_1 Stomatal conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, therefore g_{vs}=\\\\frac{1}{R_{vs}} . A dynamic porometer measures how long it takes for the humidity to rise from one specified value to another in an enclosed chamber clamped to a leaf. The resistance R is then determined from the following equation: \\\\Delta t=\\\\frac{\\\\left(R+A\\\\right)l\\\\Delta h}{1-h} where ‚àÜt is the time required for the cup humidity to change by ‚àÜh, h is the cup humidity, l is the cup ‚Äúlength,‚Äù and A is an offset constant. Null balance porometers maintain a constant humidity in an enclosed chamber by regulating the flow of dry air through the chamber and find stomatal resistance from the following equation: R_{vs}=\\\\frac{A}{f}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{h}-1\\\\right)-R_{va} where R_{vs} is the stomatal resistance, R_{va} is the boundary layer resistance, A is the leaf area, f is the flow rate of dry air, and h is the chamber humidity. The resistance values found by these equations are typically converted to conductance values.  Models  A number of models of stomatal conductance exist. = Ball-Berry-Leuning model = The Ball-Berry-Leuning model was formulated by Ball, Woodrow and Berry in 1987, and improved by Leuning in the early 90s. The model formulates stomatal conductance, g as g = g_0 + \\\\frac{a_1 A_n}{(c_s - \\\\Gamma) (1 + \\\\frac{D_s}{D_0})} where g is the stomatal conductance for diffusion, g_0 is the value of g at the light compensation point, A_n is assimilation rate of the leaf, D_s is the vapour pressure deficit, c_s is the leaf-surface CO2 concentration, \\\\Gamma is the CO2 compensation point. a_1 and D_0 are empirical coefficients.

When built, it was the largest smelting facility in the world.National Research Council, 2005: 16 It is located in what became known as the Silver Valley of the Coeur d'Alene Basin, an area for a century that was a center of extensive silver and other metal mining and processing. This resulted in extensive contamination of water, land and air, endangering residents including the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, which had traditionally depended on fish from the waterways as part of its subsistence. In 1983 the United States Environmental Protection Agency added this area to the National Priorities List as a Superfund site for investigation and cleanup. In 1991 the Coeur d'Alene Tribe filed suit against the mining companies for damages and cleanup costs; they were joined by the United States in 1996 and the state of Idaho in 2011. Settlement was reached with the two major defendants in 2008 and 2011, with an agreement for funding of $263.4 million plus interest for cleanup and restoration of habitat. History Phillip O'Rourke filed the Bunker Hill mining claim on 10 Sept. 1885, located along the west side of Milo Creek. Named after the Revolutionary War battle, the claim listed the date of discovery as 4 Sept., with Noah S. Kellogg as a witness. Similar claims were made by Noah Kellogg himself, Jacob Goetz and Cornelius Sullivan, which included the Sullivan claim on the east side of Milo Creek. Other claims followed, including the Last Chance by Charles Sweeny, the Stemwinder by George B. McAuley, and the Sierra Nevada by Van B. LeLashmutt. In all the stories recounting the original find, a jackass plays a key role in discovering the galena ore vein. A later court ruling awarded O.O. Peck and Dr. J.T. Cooper of Murray, Idaho, a quarter interest in the Bunker Hill claim, since those two provided the ore-discovering jackass as a grubstake to Noah Kellogg. Noah Kellogg subsequently leased the claim to Jim Wardner, who went on to found the town of Wardner, Idaho on 4 April 1886. Milled ore was initially shipped by wagon to Kingston, Idaho, then by the steamship The Coeur d' Alene to Coeur d' Alene, Idaho, then by wagon to Rathdrum, Idaho, and finally loaded onto the Northern Pacific Railroad. Later, Daniel Chase Corbin built the Spokane Falls and Idaho Railway to connect Coeur d' Alene to the Northern Pacific Railway on the east side of Spokane, Washington, and the Coeur d' Alene Railway and Navigation Company railway to link Cataldo, Idaho with Burke, Idaho. Then in 1886, Corbin bought the Coeur d' Alene and a second steamship, the General Sherman, and built a new mill, which milled 100 tons of ore a day into refined ore containing 28 ounces of silver per ton. The ore was smelted in Wickes, Montana. In 1887, Corbin added a third steamship, the Kootenai. The steamships were replaced by a Northern Pacific and Union Pacific railway in 1891. Simeon Reed bought the Bunker Hill Mine and Mill, and incorporated the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mining and Concentrating Company on 29 July 1887. John Hays Hammond was hired to manage the mine, and a new concentrator, The Old South Mill, became operational in 1891, capable of 150 tons per day. A 10,000 foot long aerial tramway was installed to connect the adit in Wardner with the mill in Kellogg. Frederick Worthen Bradley took over management of the mine in 1893, and became president of Bunker Hill Co.in 1897. He installed the first electric hoist in 1894, and replaced the haulage horses with a locomotive. In 1897, work started on a tunnel connecting the mine with Kellogg. Then, in 1898, he gained control of the ASARCO lead smelter in Tacoma, Washington, when Bunker Hill Co. and Alaska Treadwell purchased a controlling interest. For years Bunker Hill, like other mines in the region, was the site of intense struggles between regional miners' unions and mine owners/managers.Aiken, 1993 The owners of the Bunker Hill mine organized with other mine owners to form the Mine Owners Protective Association in order to fight the unions.National Research Council, p. 26 The Bunker Hill owners repeatedly refused to meet or negotiate with union representatives, leading to regular community protests. On April 29, 1899, during a union demonstration, a group of workers hijacked a Northern Pacific train in Burke, Idaho and took it to Wardner. After a firefight with the Bunker Hill security guards, they dynamited the Bunker Hill and Sullivan ore concentrator, which was valued at $250,000.Aiken, 2005: p. 27 A new and more efficient mill, with greater capacity, was in operation within 3 months. In 1903, Washington Water and Power completed building over 80 miles of electrical transmission line between Spokane Falls and Burke, and the company upgraded to electrical machinery. This coincided with the company connecting all of the mines underground, and the completion of the over 12,000 foot Kellogg tunnel. Then, on 10 March 1904, the March ore body was discovered, substantially increasing the mine's reserves. Then, in a 1910 stock deal, Bunker Hill gained outright ownership of the Last Chance mine. Bunker Hill Co. sold their ASARCO Tacoma smelter to the Guggenheims in 1905, but continued to process their concentrates there, in addition to using the Carnegie Co. and a smelter in Salida, Colorado. Yet, economics dictated Bunker Hill build its own smelter at Smelterville, Idaho, which it began operating on 5 July 1917. An improved concentrating process, which included the use of the Huntington roller mill, Callow screens, and Wilfley tables, produced concentrates of 75%. A cadmium recovery plant was added to the zinc plant in 1929. This recovery system was replaced in 1945, when the company added a cadmium-processing facility to the smelter, which recovered high-grade cadmium from the smelter's fume and baghouse waste.National Research Council, p. 32 Also during WWII, Bunker Hill added an antimony electrolytic plant, and because of the manpower shortage, employed about 200 women. As the mine reached 400 feet below sea level, the company installed a Carrier Mine Spot Cooler. This cooler reduced the temperature from 87¬∞ Fahrenheit to about 80¬∞, and the relative humidity from 96% to 84%. In 1947, the mine started using block caving to mine lower grade ore bodies. By 1948, the mill had a 3000 tons per day capacity, the smelter produced almost 10,000 tons of lead per month, the zinc plant had a capacity of over 4000 tons of zinc per month, and the cadmium plant was capable of 50,000 pounds per month. The huge Shea ore body was discovered in 1949, at the No. 17 level. In 1952, the company added a sulfuric acid plant with a 250-ton per day capacity. Most of this was sold to the J.R. Simplot Corp. for fertilizer use. In 1981, parent company Gulf Resources & Chemical Corp., which had acquired Bunker Hill in 1968, announced it would close the mine and smelter complex, citing low metal prices, lack of concentrates, and a stricter EPA lead limit of 1.5 micrograms for air quality. At the time of its closure in 1982, the Bunker Hill lead smelter was the largest in the world, and the complex included a zinc plant and silver refinery. The Coeur d'Alene people were able to regain control of a portion of Lake Coeur d'Alene, after a long history of their interests being ignored. The over 100 buildings that made up the smelter complex were demolished. On May 27, 1996 the four smokestacks that made up the city skyline, the tallest being 715-feet, were laced with explosives and toppled.https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1996/05-27/346911_smelterville_stacks_topple.html Phil Peterson, a man from Nampa, Idaho won a raffle to push the plunger to set off the explosives. Environmental issues The process used by the first mills, known as \\"jigging,\\" was very inefficient, often recovering less than 75% of the metal from the ore. This meant that large amounts of lead and other metals remained in the tailings, which were dumped in nearby waterways.National Research Council, p. 24 Many of the mine tailings were dumped directly into the Coeur d'Al√©ne River and its tributaries, which became polluted with high levels of sulfur dioxide, lead, and other metals. The water in the river turned opaque gray, earning the stream the nickname \\"Lead Creek.\\" In 1899, farmers complained about the mine debris, and by 1910, 65 of them took the company to U.S. District Court. The farmers each received one dollar in damages, with the judge ruling the company could continue to dump debris into the streams. The company did build a tailings dam and later a tailings pond, but continued production despite additional suits. The company joined other mines in forming the Debris Association for litigation defense and payment of some claims. Before the smelter was constructed, the company knew the smoke and fumes would be an issue, and the lead emissions were a health risk. In the words of the Public Health Service surgeon, Dr. Royd R. Sayers, written in 1918, \\"Whoever works in or about a lead smelter may become leaded.\\" Yet, the 1924 Idaho Industrial Accident Board stated lead poisoning was an occupational disease not eligible for compensation. In other words, the miners assumed the risk by choosing to work. The company did have a compensation plan for victims, and implemented a Clauge electrolytic treatment in 1919, and a solarium in 1929. In an effort to reduce particles, the company installed a 14-unit Frederick Cottrell electrostatic precipitator, and 2800-bag baghouse to capture dust. In 1936, the company added an Impinger dust collector and an Owens jet-dust counter. Prompted by a series of newspaper articles published in 1929, the Idaho State legislature formed the Coeur d'Alene River and Lake Commission in 1931. The commission was tasked with eliminating mine waste contaminating the Coeur d'Alene River and entering Lake Coeur d'Alene, a source of drinking water for Harrison, Idaho, and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The commission did determine mine tailings were the cause of the pollution, and mine owners were required to provide settling basins and employ a suction dredger at Cataldo, Idaho, starting in 1932. Yet, the commission determined the water was safe to drink, as long as consumption was limited to less than 2.4 gallons per day! Dr. M.M. Ellis of the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries determined the only solution to the pollution in the water system, and consequent lack of fish, was the complete exclusion of dumping mine wastes into the river. Yet, a 1948 deed granted that right to the company. In summary, though everyone, the company, the government, and the public, agreed tailings and smelter smoke polluted the region, the importance of the mine to the economy took precedent. In the 1950s, the US Forest Service complained that fumes from the zinc plant were killing trees in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest. Yet the company continued to purchase pollution easements, use its political clout with the government, and tell the public that pollution was the cost of economic and employment benefits. During the 1970s, the Idaho Department of Highways noted that bridges around Kellogg corroded faster. A fire on 3 Sept. 1973, damaged 2 of the 7 sections in the smelter baghouse. The baghouse was not back in normal operation until 17 March 1974. The company actually increased lead production during this period, taking advantage of increased prices. Lead emissions increased to 35.3 tons per month, compared to 8.3 tons per month from 1955 to 1964. Lead levels in Kellogg-Smelterville had increased to 13.2 micrograms per cubic meter in 1973, compared to 3.9 in 1971. After two Kellogg children were hospitalized for lead poisoning in 1974, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 22% of the children within one mile of the smelter had lead poisoning, more than 80 micrograms of lead per 0.1 liter of blood, and almost all had more than 40. The Shoshone County Lead Health Project reported in 1975, that 45 children had lead poisoning, with one child having the highest blood lead level ever recorded. Children living in nearby areas began displaying very high blood lead levels. Approximately 26% of the two-year-olds in the region had dangerously high levels of lead in their blood, which had long-term negative consequences for their health, especially intellectual functioning and achievement. Bunker Hill stated employing women in the workforce again in 1972, which eventually included 30 in the smelter and 15 in the zinc plant, and the first to work underground. Yet, in 1975, the company banned fertile women from working in the smelter or zinc plant, due to the inherent risk. The company started revegetating 18,000 acres in 1972. In April 1975, Bunker Hill stated that employees with blood lead levels higher than 80 micrograms per 0.1 liters, had 90 days to reduce them or be dismissed. However, 1980 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules required the company to remove employees with elevated blood lead levels with no reduction in pay, only allowing them to return when their levels dropped below 60 micrograms per 0.1 liter. Yet, over half of the smelter workforce exceeded 60. Even more stringent OSHA rules were to take effect in 1984. The company shut down operations for 7 days in Dec. 1975, when it could not meet the EPA standards for SO2. Bunker Hill had started the curtailment program in 1973 to deal with emissions not captured by the sulfuric acid plant. Then in 1976, the company decided to build a 715-foot stack at the lead smelter, and a 610-foot stack at the zinc plant, to better disperse emissions. In 1983, the Bunker Hill smelter was added to the National Priorities List as a Superfund site by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. As of 2007, the EPA had spent $200 million attempting to remediate the site, much of which was spent removing contaminated topsoil from residential areas.Gerber & Jensen, 2007: p. 262 The state of Idaho had also spent funds since the early 1980s on cleanup. While there were measurable improvements in environmental conditions, a vast amount of cleanup and restoration was still required. Coeur d'Alene 1991 Lawsuit for damages and cleanup In 1991 the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, concerned that progress was too slow at the Superfund site, brought suit against Hecla Mining Company, ASARCO and other companies for damages and recovery of cleanup costs of the site. In 1996 it was joined by the United States in the suit. In 2001 the United States and the Coeur d'Alene litigated a 78-day trial against Hecla and ASARCO over liability issues. In 2008, ASARCO, the other major defendant, reached settlement with the Coeur d'Alene and United States after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\\"Hecla Mining Company to Pay $263 Million in Settlement to Resolve Idaho Superfund Site Litigation and Foster Cooperation\\", Press release, US Department of Justice, 13 June 2011; accessed 31 May 2016 In 2011 the government, the Coeur d'Alene, and the state of Idaho (which joined the suit to participate in settlement) reached settlement with the Hecla Mining Company to resolve one of the largest cases ever filed under the Superfund statute. Hecla Mining Company will pay $263.4 million plus interest to the United States and other parties to \\"resolve claims stemming from releases of wastes from its mining operations. Settlement funds will be dedicated to restoration and remediation of natural resources in the Coeur d'Alene Basin.\\" The trustees intend to restore habitat for fish, birds and other natural resources, for stewardship while working for economic progress in the region.

Handball is one of the four Gaelic games organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association. Its headquarters is located in Croke Park, Dublin. There are approximately 200 handball clubs in Ireland. As in the parent organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), a president is elected every three years. As of 2019, the president is Joe Masterson from Offaly, who took up his role at the 2017 annual congress. The national committee of GAA Handball is Ard Comhairle (the central council) on which the president sits as chairman. History Since its foundation in 1884, the charter of the Gaelic Athletic Association included handball as one of the sports to be promoted by the association. In 1924, the \\"Irish Handball Council\\" (rebranded as GAA Handball in 2009) was established to promote and develop the game. From the 1940s to the 1970s, handball was popular in the Republic of Ireland. It was cheap, fun and easy to play, but as years went by, handball lost its popularity to other GAA sports such as football and hurling and of course to \\"foreign\\" sports such as soccer and rugby. In recent times however there has been a surge in popularity of the sport, with the re- branding of the sport as GAA Handball and the ongoing promotion of the sport and especially One Wall handball by the organisation. One-wall courts have been built in many schools across Ireland following this new found popularity. In 2012 Ireland hosted the World Handball Championships in the Citywest International Events Arena in Dublin, where a multi-court complex was erected to host the greatest International Handball event in history, with over 30 countries and 2,000+ competitors in attendance. Due to the increasing popularity of One Wall handball it is hoped it will become an Olympic sport, and during the 2012 World Handball Championships a new unified International Federation for the sport worldwide was established and it is called the World Wall Ball Association (WWBA). Television coverage In late 2010, GAA Handball announced that it was to launch a new TV show on TG4 featuring highlights of the biggest competitions that were held over the last couple of months. In mid to late December of that year, TG4 premiered the first ever edition of the GAA Handball show and it was followed by a six-part series that was broadcast in January, 2011. It was a huge success and following the broadcast of the six episodes, through a new association with TG4 as GAA Handball Ireland's media partner, this has been doubled with more episodes now to come. The new series commenced on Monday 2 January 2012 with the opening 2 of the 8 episodes, and again every Monday night, on TG4 in January 2012. Further television coverage was shown on RT√â, TG4, TV3 (Ireland) and Sky Sports for the 2012 All Ireland 40x20 Open Championships and for the 2012 World Championships. GAA Handball Ireland also puts coverage of the sport on to the video-sharing website YouTube National and international competitions =Irish Competitions= There are many handball competitions that are run in Ireland. In 40x20, the main competitions are County, Province, and All-Ireland Championships plus the 40x20 Irish Nationals. In 60x30 Softball and Hardball, the main competitions are County, Province, and All- Ireland Championships. In 2011 GAA Handball Ireland launched the 60x30 Nationals and this competition was held in July. In One-Wall handball, the main competition in Ireland is the Irish One-Wall Nationals, and this has been held in Breaffy House Sports Arena, Castlebar, since 2009. There are also many competitions during the year held by various handball clubs around the country. =International competitions= As with the Irish competitions, there are many international one-wall and 40x20 competitions, the main one being the World Handball Championships which are run every 3 years. In 2012, the 'Worlds' was held in Ireland, in the Citywest International Events Arena in Dublin. The next worlds was held in 2015 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The two codes of handball played in the World Handball Championships are 40x20 small court and One-Wall. Ireland currently have the World 40x20 Senior Men's Singles (Paul Brady) and Doubles Runners-up (Paul Brady, Michael Finnegan) and Ladies Senior Singles (Aisling Reilly) and Doubles Champions (Fiona Shannon, Sibeal Gallagher). National Handball Centre Following a number of planning issues, GAA Handball Ireland were granted final planning approval in late 2017 to build a National Handball Centre at Croke Park. As of February 2019, the centre was under development. The new National Handball Centre, located at the southeast corner of the Croke Park stadium campus on Sackville Avenue, was completed in 2020. The centre has yet to be officially opened by GAA Handball. The new centre contains three 4-Wall handball courts - including a three sided glass wall show court, a Softball show court and three 1-Wall courts as well as offices for GAA Handball staff, a bar and cafe as well as a community centre. The centre was used by Ireland's national health service, the Health Service Executive for Covid-19 coronavirus testing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is a stick with metallic rings attached, which jingle in time with the beating of the stick. The alounloun is said to descend from the staff of King Te-Agdanlin. The alounloun was established for the royal court in the Porto-Novo area; it was initially a symbol of the king's power that was later transformed into a musical instrument. It became a tradition to use the alounloun to honor eminent officials in the royal court. An alounloun is on display at the Royal Palace Museum in Porto-Novo. Historical background The alounloun originated as a staff symbolizing the power of the king of Allada (a kingdom in southern Benin). Te-Agdanlin, founder of the kingdom of Porto-Novo, inherited it from his father King De-Kopkon when he died. He took the alounloun with him during the migration towards southeastern Benin where he created the kingdom of Hogbonou (Porto-Novo). After he in turn died, the alounloun underwent various transformations depending on the taste and aspirations of each king. A descendant of Te'Agbanlin, De-Gbeyon, transformed the stick into a musical instrument during his reign (1765-1775). From that time on, it has been used to accompany songs paying homage to Porto-Novoan royalty, living or deceased. Roman Catholic evangelism and the Vatican II Council led Father Francis Aupiais, parish priest of Porto-Novo in the 1930s, to inaugurate an Epiphany procession through the city. The alounloun was played on this occasion in honour of Jesus. Today the alounloun is used to play a type of music called adjogan in formal, royal ceremonies. Adjogan music is also used in Catholic churches in the Porto-Novo area; in this case the royal insignia on the staff is changed from a bird crest to a Christian cross. The instrument is played only by women. Physical characteristics The alounloun is a finely worked iron bar about one meter long, covered in copper with rings that manually slide up and down the stick to produce music. It has a handle in the shape of a bird with a coiled crested neck as well as a spindle and a pad. It is an idiophone: that is, an instrument that produces sound by vibrating as a whole when the body of the instrument itself is struck, shaken, rubbed, plucked or stamped, without the use of strings or membranes.

In Japan it operates as a television network, and in the rest of the world as a streaming service using the infrastructure of Endeavor Streaming Services. On January 8, 2014, WWE announced the network would launch on February 24 in the United States. The company stated on July 31 that the service was expected to go live in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey, the Nordics, the Middle East and North Africa, worldwide among other countries starting on August 17. It was unexpectedly made available in the UK and Ireland a week earlier than planned, on January 13, 2015, after a delay from the previous November.WWE Network Launches February 24 Retrieved January 25, 2014 The WWE Network consists of both a 24-hour linear streaming channel and on-demand programming from WWE's library.  History  =Development and U.S. launch= The origins of the WWE Network can trace back to 2000 when USA Network filed the lawsuit against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as the WWE) due to breach of contract which saw most of its programming moved to Viacom-owned TNN and MTV. The Delaware Chancery Court ruled in favor of the WWF in June 2000.https://www.fiercevideo.com/cable/revenge-mcmahons- story-behind-wwe-network Then CEO Linda McMahon revealed that WWF wanted its own cable network and testified that before WWF signed a rights deal with Viacom, the company had floated the idea of acquiring USA's Sci-Fi Channel, and reformatting it as a dedicated wrestling network. USA executives rejected the idea, and McMahon said that former USA Networks President Barry Baker encouraged her to talk to other programmers about potential deals. \\"I can tell you right now, Linda, you're not going to get anybody to give you a network,\\" McMahon testified. In 2005, USA Network re-acquired the rights to all WWE programming. In September 2011, WWE officially announced plans to launch the WWE Network in 2011 as a pay-TV channel. WWE then conducted a survey asking people if they would pay for the WWE Network if it were a premium channel. In an email sent to WWE fans who might be interested in the WWE Network, WWE surveyed fans for their thoughts about the WWE Network airing WWE's pay-per- views to subscribers for no additional charge. The survey also noted that feature repeats of Raw and SmackDown, as well as footage from World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), XFL, Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), American Wrestling Association (AWA), and WWE movies would also make the lineup. Original programming was also noted in the survey. As the result of an online poll, WrestleMania Recap was chosen as a name for a new WWE Network show on October 17, 2011. The original launch date was set for April 1, 2012, which would have coincided with WrestleMania XXVIII, and WWE's official website featured a countdown clock that would have expired on April 1. The clock was quietly removed, and the network did not launch as advertised. WWE chief marketing officer Michelle Wilson allayed fears about the future of the WWE Network, saying \\"There will be a WWE network in some shape or form. We are in late-stage negotiations with distributors\\", and confirmed that WWE Legends' House had been filmed. In April 2013, WWE had switched plans and aimed to release the WWE Network as a premium pay-TV outlet, with a potential price of $15 a month. On Old School Raw in January 2014, WWE ran teasers promoting an announcement on January 8 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, later confirming that the announcement concerned the WWE Network. At the Consumer Electronics Show, WWE revealed a comprehensive plan which would see a launch date of February 24, 2014 in the United States. WWE Classics on Demand closed on January 31, 2014 to make way for the WWE Network. A free trial period was offered during the week of the launch. The logo initially used for the WWE Network eventually became the standard logo used by the WWE corporation in August 2014. In April 2014, ahead of WrestleMania XXX, the Network received acclaim, with The New York Times saying that WWE had \\"positioned themselves on the cutting edge of Internet television.\\" Later that month, the company announced that the network had 667,000 subscribers, short of the one million subscribers they needed to break even. As WWE's stock fell 50% the following month, Forbes described low subscription numbers as being of \\"additional concern\\" for investors after WWE's underwhelming NBCUniversal renewal deal. WWE offered a second free preview week of the WWE Network, which started July 7, in an attempt to sign new subscribers. A second report released at the end of July indicated that the network had reached 700,000 subscribers. WWE's goal was to reach one million subscribers by the end of 2014. =Expansion= On July 31, 2014, the company announced a 10-year, Canadian distribution deal for WWE content with Rogers Media which will see the company distribute WWE Network as a premium television service. Also on that date, it was announced that the WWE Network would launch in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Spain, and the Nordics, among others on August 12, with Italian, Arab, German, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Thai, and Malaysian launches planned for a later date. On October 30, 2014, in an attempt to increase subscription numbers from an announced figure of 731,000, the 6-month subscription requirement was dropped, allowing subscribers the option to cancel at any time. WWE had originally planned to launch the network on October 1 in the United Kingdom, but was delayed for a further month. The launch was confirmed to be taking place at 8 p.m. on November 3; however, 20 minutes prior to the launch, WWE announced that it had been indefinitely delayed. Vince McMahon publicly apologized for the delay. It was announced on January 4, 2015, that the WWE Network would be launching in the UK and Ireland on January 19, 2015, priced at ¬£9.99 and ‚Ç¨12.99 respectively, although some customers managed to register as early as January 13. On January 27, 2015, WWE announced that the WWE Network had reached 1 million subscribers, with Vince McMahon saying that WWE would \\"remain focused on delivering an outstanding value proposition for ours fans by adding new content and new features in the coming year.\\" On February 12, 2015, WWE announced a five-year partnership with television provider OSN to bring the WWE Network to the Middle East and North Africa as a premium service. On July 30, 2015, WWE revealed the amount of subscribers for the Network at 1.156 million. This was announced as a part of WWE's financial reporting on the second quarter of the year, which had resulted in their stock price rising past $20.00 after closing on the previous day at $16.48. The total of 1.156 million paid subscribers marked a 13% decrease from the 1.315 million paid subscribers that was stated in the reports for the first quarter of 2015. WWE also revealed, including trial subscribers, they had 1.227 million Network users at the end of the second quarter, and over the entire lifespan of the Network, there have been over 2 million unique subscribers. The WWE Network launched in India on November 2, 2015. On November 19, a report by market research and consulting firm Park Associates announced that the WWE Network had broken into the top five streaming services and trailed only MLB.tv in the sports category. The WWE announced the network would launch in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan on January 5, 2016, followed by Thailand and the Philippines on February 29, 2016. In April 2017, WWE announced a total of 1.949 million subscribers to the WWE Network, of which 1.661 million were paid subscribers. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, the number had dropped to 1.5 million paid users. In April 2018, WWE announced subscriber growth had reached 2.1 million, with 1.8 million paid. At the end of the third quarter of 2018 the number had dropped to 1.6 million paid users. = Switch to Endeavor, redesign = In January 2019, WWE Network signed with Endeavor Streaming to replace BAMTech as its operating partner. WWE's decision was motivated by the acquisition of BAMTech by Disney. Co-president George Barrios cited concerns over how BAMTech's relationships with third-party partners would be impacted by the sale, while WWE also sought greater control over the service and its operations, intending to partner with another vendor or take the service entirely in-house. The company decided to partner with Endeavor Streaming (formed primarily from the assets of NeuLion) to provide infrastructure and billing services, and Massive Interactive to develop a new front-end and mobile apps. The new WWE Network platform launched in July 2019, ahead of SummerSlam. It includes a revamped user experience, support for 1080p streams, new browsing tools (such as a new \\"Superstars\\" interface for filtering content by performers), and plans to add a download feature for offline viewing in the future. Support for certain legacy devices, such as PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and certain older smart TVs, was discontinued with the changeover. In an interview with The Verge, Barrios revealed that there were ongoing plans for WWE.com's existing video content to be integrated into the WWE Network platform as a \\"free\\" tier (possibly also including previews of WWE Network's premium content), and that WWE was also considering the development of a premium tier with additional features (such as benefits for other WWE operations). Availability thumbAvailability of the WWE Network globally The WWE Network is currently available through 186 out of 193 United Nations member states (including all 27 European Union nations) and two observer states such as the Holy See and the State of Palestine. It is also distributed through six non-UN countries: the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Cook Islands, Kosovo, Niue, Northern Cyprus and SADR- claimed Western Sahara. In late 2017, Liechtenstein and PRC-controlled Mainland China were added to the list of non-available countries, however the WWE Network is still available in the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau as well as ROC-controlled Taiwan and Fujian. In 2020 Malta was removed from countries available, no reason was provided. On March 23, 2020, WWE announced a free access to WWE Network for a limited time that includes every past WrestleMania and other major pay-per-views such as SummerSlam, Royal Rumble and Survivor Series. On June 1, 2020, WWE announced a free version of the WWE Network containing a limited library of content which includes new shows like Raw Talk, Talking Smack and original series including Monday Night War, Ride Along, Table for 3, Photo Shoot and Story Time. The free version also includes access to recent episodes of WWE's programs, Monday Night Raw, Friday Night SmackDown and NXT, with the addition of historical WWE pay-per-views and NXT TakeOver events.

Although the United States parental guidelines rating system rates most weekly WWE television programs TV-PG, the WWE Network broadcasts a wider range of content. A parental controls block is available and content rated TV-14 and TV-MA are preceded by an advisory warning. The network airs footage featuring Chris Benoit; it marks the first major airing of Benoit footage or even mention of Benoit in said footage since his murder-suicide in 2007. However, the Benoit tribute episode of Raw is replaced with the episode that aired internationally, a recap of championship matches. Also, Vengeance: Night of Champions in 2007 removes all references to Benoit during the ECW Championship match. Over the Edge 1999, infamous for Owen Hart's death at the event, is also available for the first time since its original air date; however, some portions of the event have been edited out of respect to the Hart family. Matches called with Jesse Ventura on commentary, which had previously been dubbed over due to a 1991 lawsuit, are available with the original commentary. While the network promoted on-demand airings as being unedited, some instances of expletives, gestures, and all nudity are censored. Many programs were digitized for WWE 24/7 prior to the 2012 settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature, and thus the \\"WWF\\" and the \\"WWF scratch\\" logo are censored in some instances. Some original music has been dubbed over with alternate tracks such as the original intro music to Saturday Night's Main Event (May 1985 ‚Äì January 1988 episodes) which originally played \\"Obsession\\" by Animotion. At launch, all but one of New Jack's matches were removed from ECW pay-per-views, as was his surprise return at Heat Wave 1998, due to a combination of musical rights issues over his entrance music and the inability to remove the music without losing the original commentary audio. The deleted matches were eventually reinstated with replacement music and newly recorded Joey Styles commentary. Several pay-per-views are copies of their condensed home video releases, rather than the live versions, and so are missing matches. Pay-per-views Almost every WWF/WWE, JCP/WCW, and ECW pay-per- view (PPV) event ever produced is available for on-demand streaming. Although WWE promotes the selection as every pay-per-view ever made, a handful of PPV events have not yet been made available. This includes mostly foreign events such as WCW's Millennium Final, Collision in Korea, and the Japan Supershows, and ECW's foreign ECW/FMW Supershows, however it also includes some events held domestically such as WCW's Nitro Girls Swimsuit Calendar Special and When Worlds Collide, and WWF's No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie. In addition the pay-per-view section contains several events which did not air on pay-per- view, such as WWE events Royal Rumble 1988 and WWE Global Warning Tour: Melbourne. Many ECW Supercards are also listed as pay-per-views, despite never actually airing there.

Impact on pay-per-view industry  In an interview with Time, Michelle D. Wilson, chief revenue and marketing officer for WWE, stated their reason for bypassing cable companies and instead only offering the WWE Network online: \\"Digital over-the-top offerings represent the future, and given that our passionate fans consume five times more online video content than non-WWE viewers and over-index for purchasing online subscriptions such as Netflix and Hulu, we believe the time is now for a WWE Network.\\" In response to the announcement, DirecTV issued a statement saying that they are re-evaluating whether to continue carrying WWE's pay-per-view events. Due to the fact that these events would also be available on the WWE Network once it launches, it might reduce the number of pay-per-view purchases via cable and satellite providers. Vince McMahon suggested that pay-TV operators would ultimately decide to continue to carry WWE's pay-per-view events, given that providers keep a significant share of each purchase, and incur minimal costs (apart from WWE's share of the fee for each purchase) to carry the events: \\"It's found money for them.\\" DirecTV later quietly dropped carriage of WWE PPVs. In response, WWE said, \\"Yes, DIRECTV has decided to stop offering our PPV's residentially and commercially. The only other option would be to work through the local cable provider.\\" On February 19, 2014, Dish Network announced that they would carry WWE pay-per-views on an event by event basis, beginning with Elimination Chamber. Dish Network later released a statement saying, \\"Dish will not offer the ‚ÄòWWE Elimination Chamber‚Äô PPV on 2/23. WWE is not willing to adjust their PPV costs to satellite and cable companies, which is unfair to their customers. We need to re-focus our efforts to support partners that better serve Dish customers.\\" Dish later made a decision to air WrestleMania XXX. Dish declined to offer WrestleMania 31 and 32 but did offer WrestleMania 33 in 2017.  Advertising  In October 2014, it was reported Mattel, Kmart, and Pepsi would begin advertising on the network starting the week of October 13. Wilson stated that although no commercial breaks will occur during scheduled programming, 30 second adverts would run in between shows, and that one 15 or 30-second advert would be shown prior to every fourth stream of on-demand content.

In this way mesocosm studies provide a link between field surveys and highly controlled laboratory experiments. Mesocosms also tend to be medium-sized to large (e.g., aquatic mesocosm range: 1 to > 10,000 L) and contain multiple trophic levels of interacting organisms. In contrast to laboratory experiments, mesocosm studies are normally conducted outdoors in order to incorporate natural variation (e.g., diel cycles). Mesocosm studies may be conducted in either an enclosure that is small enough that key variables can be brought under control or by field-collecting key components of the natural environment for further experimentation. Extensive mesocosm studies have been conducted to evaluate how organisms or communities might react to environmental change, through deliberate manipulation of environmental variables, such as increased temperature, carbon dioxide or pH levels.  Advantages  A tomato greenhouse in the Netherlands. The advantage of mesocosm studies is that environmental gradients of interest (e.g., warming temperatures) can be controlled or combined to separate and understand the underlying mechanism(s) affecting the growth or survival of species, populations or communities of interest. By manipulating gradients (e.g., climate variables) mesocosm studies can extend beyond available data helping to build better models of the effects of different scenarios. Mesocosm experiments also tend to include replication of different treatment levels. Manipulating something can give us an idea as to what to expect if something were to occur in that ecosystem or environment. For indoor mesocosms, growth chambers allow us to control the experiment. You can place plants in a growth chamber and manipulate the air, temperature, heat and light distribution and observe the effects when exposed to different amounts of each factor. Greenhouses also contribute to mesocosm studies although sometimes, it may induce climate change, interfering with the experiment and resulting in inefficient data.  Disadvantages  Using growth chambers for a laboratory experiment is sometimes a disadvantage due to the limited amount of space. Another disadvantage to using mesocosms is not adequately imitating the environment, causing the organism to avoid giving off a certain reaction versus its natural behavior in its original environment.  Examples  A Hoplias malabaricus fish. [A] Mazzeo and colleagues examined the eating habits of Hoplias malabaricus fish when exposed to different amounts of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and competition. Three months prior to conducting the experiment, they maintained an average precipitation, air temperature, and overall subtropical environment. Using 12 units, they filled them with aquifer water, sand and plants and kept them in isolation until the environment became suitable for phytoplankton to emerge. After careful preparation, Mazzeo et al. began the experiment dividing those units into categories of a control (zooplankton and phytoplankton) and 3 experiments: (Jenynsia multidentata with zooplankton and phytoplankton), (juvenile Hoplias malabaricus with zooplankton and phytoplankton), and (Large Hoplias malabaricus, Jenynsia multidentata, zooplankton, and phytoplankton) and observed biomass differences within different conditions. [B] Flanagan and McCauley tested the effects of climate warming on carbon dioxide concentration on shallow ponds by creating an eight- cylinder shaped in situ mesocosms. They divided it into four controls and four experiments on University of Calgary's campus pond. Those mesocosms contained openings underneath and were submerged at the same depth as the pond. By carefully sustaining the sediments and temperature from any changes, the production of zooplankton and algae were successful. After manipulation (pumping heat into water), they measured the sediments at the bottom of the pond for carbon dioxide concentration. After collecting data and analyzing it, Flanagan and McCauley concluded that due to the warming of the environment in the pond, carbon dioxide from the pond will increase into the surroundings, in turn, decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide within the sediments, indirectly modifying the carbon cycle of that ecosystem. [C] Mesocosms are useful for studying the fate of pollutants in marine environments as well as providing the ability to conduct controlled manipulative experiments that could not be undertaken in natural marine environments. Since 1976, the Marine Ecosystems Research Laboratory (MERL) at the University of Rhode Island has been conducting pollution studies and experimental marine ecological studies using mesocosm tanks drawing water from nearby Narragansett Bay. The Marine Ecosystems Research Laboratory (MERL) mesocosms are 8 meters deep and 7 cubic meters in volume. The mesocosm tanks were designed to match the average depth of the adjacent West Passage of Narragansett Bay, from which they draw their water. MERL is located at off South Ferry Rd. in Narragansett, Rhode Island. Example publications of scientific studies using the MERL mesocosms include: * Hinga, K.R., M.E.Q. Pilson, R.F. Lee, J.W.

Xiguan or Saikwan is an ancient town and an area in the Liwan district of Guangzhou, China, which was located west of the old walled city. The Thirteen Factories trading enclave was located on its southern shore and the Shamian enclave was constructed beside it. Xiguan continues to have a distinctive culture within Guangzhou and some residents speak a distinctive dialect of Cantonese. It now forms most of Liwan District.  Name  Before the 20th century, Guangzhou was a walled city with many gates. Its western gates included the Taiping Gate T√†ip√≠ngm√©n; . \\"Gate of Great Peace\\") and the West Gate Zhengxim√©n, . \\"Straight Western Gate\\"). \\"Saikwan\\" or is a romanization of the local Cantonese pronunciation of the same Chinese characters. It was formerly the area's more common English name, although Mandarin pinyin is now the official form within China. It was also sometimes simply translated as \\"Westgate\\" or the \\"western suburbs\\" of Guangzhou (formerly known as \\"Canton\\"). \\"Xiguan\\" or \\"New Xiguan\\" is also an informal name for Guangzhou's Liwan District. Geography Old Xiguan covered most of the present Liwan District, excluding Xicun Xƒ´c≈´n; . \\"West Village\\") Litchi Bay, and the old Fangcun District. It ran along the Pearl River from the 1st Quay (, p Diyƒ´ Jin, j Dai6-jat7 Zeon1) in the northwest to the outlet of the western moat (, p Xƒ´h√°o, j Sai1-hou4) in the southeast. This \\"creek\\" formed the eastern boundary of the Thirteen Factories and separated Xiguan from Nanguan, the old city's southern suburb and Chinese dockyards. The foreign enclave on Shamian Island was usually excluded from Xiguan but Huangsha (, p Hu√°ngshƒÅ, j Wong4-2-saa1, . \\"Yellow Sands\\") was usually included. The northeastern area from the 1st Wharf to Taiping Gate was called (, p Sh√†ng Xƒ´guƒÅn, j Soeng6 Sai1-gwaan1) and the southwestern area stretching to Huangsha was known as (, p Xi√† Xƒ´guƒÅn, j Haa6 Sai1-gwaan1) In modern Guangzhou, the preservation district of Xiguan is formally defined as follows: This covers an area of and includes the area of former Shamian, united with the mainland through land reclamation. History The suburbs outside Guangzhou's Taiping Gate came to be called \\"Xiguan\\" during the Ming dynasty (14th17th century). Over time, they expanded to fill the fields between the walled city and the Pearl River. The area was administered as part of Nanhai County. It was known for its loveliness. On 15 February 1921, Xiguan was removed from Nanhai County and united with Guangfu to form an enlarged Guangzhou. On 27 October 2006, the Liwan District Government approved a preservation plan for Xiguan's traditional architecture and culture.  Culture  Three-ply Doors complete with replica scenery. Arcades on Shangxiajiu Apart from its connection to Guangdong's Lingnan and Cantonese culture, Xiguan is famed within China as the site of \\"Western Learning Spreading East\\" (:zh:Ë•øÂ≠¶‰∏úÊ∏ê, p Xƒ´xu√© D≈çng JiƒÅn, j Sai1 Hok9 Dung1 Zim1) There are varieties of customs in Xiguan, which are comparatively well conserved among districts in Guangzhou. Customs during the Chinese New Year, on Tomb Sweeping Day and Chinese Valentine's Day, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and at the Winter Solstice are more or less the same as those in other places in Guangzhou. During the Dragon Boat Festival, some male residents row dragon boats. The area's culture is celebrated in Dongshan Shaoye's song \\"Miss Xiguan\\" (, Xiguan Xiaojie) and Liao Weili's album Xiguan. Xiguan is the setting of the mainland Chinese dramas Exotic Wives and Local Husbands (, Wailai Xifu Bendi Lang) and Turbulent Xiguan (, Fengyu Xiguan) and the Hong Kong dramas Point of No Return (2003) and When Easterly Showers Fall on the Sunny West (2008). =Architecture= Church of Our Lady of Lourdes (Catholic church) on Shamian Island Christ Church Shamian (Protestant church) Architectural complex on Shamian Island Xiguan Residences (), which used to be the residences of wealthy businessmen, are the typical representative of vernacular dwellings in Xiguan. Zhutong (\\"Bamboo Tube\\") Houses are traditional houses that are rich in characteristics of Lingnan (a geographical area referring to lands in the south of China's \\"Five Ranges\\" which are Tayu, Qitian, Dupang, Mengzhu, Yuecheng. This region covers the Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces of modern China and northern Vietnam). They are relatively cruder and narrower than a Xi guan (West Customs) house. The width of this type of house is short and the depth is long; the W/L ratio varies from 1:4 to 1:8. The rooms are arranged from front to back with skylights () as intervals thus the shape of a bamboo tube. Ventilation, drainage and traffic are mainly dependent on the skylights and the roadway, i.e. the longer the house is, the more skylights are required. They appear to be one story, but since they can reach a height of 4.5 meters, they always set floor levels and stairways within the house. Stones are used to construct the base of a wall and bricks are used as the body of each wall. They always have a gable, a wooden frame and a tiled roof. Some people claim that arcades () in Xiguan correlate closely to the residences of ancient people living in Nanyue (). They are considered as the trace of Baiyue stilt house (). On the other hand, some people insist that arcades are structures built in 1925 when streets were extended and roads were constructed on a large scale in Guangzhou. Their design is deemed to have derived from ancient Greece. Arcades connect houses and make a long path for pedestrians to keep out wind, rain and the glare of sunshine. Arcades seem to be exactly designed for the climate in Guangzhou and meanwhile makes it much more convenient for stores to display their goods and attract customers. This kind of structure has always been the main feature of Guangzhou's commercial atmosphere and has become the sign of Guangdong Street or Canton Street () in other places, such as Jinling Donglu () in Shanghai Arcades in Guangzhou first appeared in the area around Sacred Heart Cathedral on Yide Lu (). Later, other business quarters in Guangzhou imitated the example such as Shangxiajiu, Zhongshan Lu, Enning Lu () and Renmin Nanlu. Buildings on Shamian can be divided into four categories: New Baroque, Neoclassical, Veranda, and Pseudo-Gothic. During the end of the nineteenth century to early twentieth centuries, along the Changdi (Long riverbank) and Xidi (west riverbank) of the Pearl River in Guangzhou, large office and commercial buildings were constructed, which reflected the popular new classical architectural style of the Nineteenth Century Western Countries and have also retained the architectural features of the Grecian and Roman times. =Cuisine= Delicacies which have earned the title of Chinese Famous Food are as follows: Peanut & Sesame Filled Cake of Ronghua Teahouse, Shuangpinai and Milk With Ginger Juice of Nanxin, Shrimp Wonton of Ouchengji, Jidi Congee of Wuzhanji, Ginger Juice & Milk Custard Tart of Qingping Restaurant, Sweetheart Cake of Lianxianglou Teahouse, Rice Noodle Roll With Beef of Yinji and Goose Liver Boiled Dumplings of Jinzhongge. Delicacies which have earned the title of Guangzhou Famous Food are as follows: Milk With Ginger Juice of Xinghualou Teahouse, Milk Paste of Fenghuang, Sesame Paste Sweet Dumplings of Rongde, Sachima of Satangji, Sampan Congee, Salty Pancake of Dechang, Stuffed Glutinous Rice Dumpling and Burst(Laughing) Deep-fried Pastry Ball of Liangyingji, White Sugar Lunjiao Cake of Guohua, Coconut Ice Cream and Grass Jelly of Shunji Bingshi. The Chinese character Ji Ë®ò is often used in a restaurant's signage, often following the owner's name. For instance, Kaiji is named for its owner Ye Jiankai. Double-skin milk in Daliang, Shunde owns a most famous reputation. The founder of Nanxin () comes from Shunde, and set up a shop in Guangzhou in 1943. The name is actually derived from the cookery and taste. When it is cooked, it appears as there are two skins for the milk. Originally in Guangzhou, the most famous one would be Nanxin store, but it's now combined with other famous snack to be sold. It looks as the white jelly and with sweet taste. Coconut ice cream of Shunji Bingshi is a well-known Xiguan snack. The restaurant was established by a street hawker named Lu Shun in the 1920s. Coconut juice, extracted from fresh coconut meat, diluted milk, eggs and refined white sugar are the ingredients. The delicacies of Shunji have been tasted by heads of foreign states and honored guests such as Norodom Sihanouk from Cambodia in the 1950s and 1960s. Since 1956, the restaurant has acquired the title of Guangzhou Famous Food. Kaiji is located on Longjin Donglu. Its owner is Ye Jiankai and he is jokingly called Dousha Kai because of the restaurant's food. Kaiji's Tangyuan (sweet dumplings) served with green bean soup and Vanilla green bean soup clear away diners' heat and toxic material and earn a high reputation in Guangzhou. The shop is Ye's grandfather's legacy. Shrimp Wonton Noodle of Ouchengji is famous. The soup served with this delicacy is the double-stewed soup made of shrimp-roe, flounder and pig bones. Fresh pork, shrimp and eggs are used in stuffing of the wontons. The wonton wrapper is so thin that wontons appear carneous after being cooked thoroughly, thus called glass wontons . Jidi Congee of Wuzhanji, alternatively called Sanyuan Jidi Congee, has been famous since Republic of China. Located in Wenchang Xiang, the restaurant is famous for its variety of congee, Jidi the congee in particular. This congee contains dried beancurd stick, gingko and flounder. The congee is also called Sanyuan Jidi Congee for the reason that the numbers of its ingredients in each bowl, namely pork balls, pork liver slices and pork intestine slices correspond respectively to the numbers of Zhuangyuan, Bangyan and Tanhua . Wuzhanji's Jidi Congee earned the title of Chinese Famous Food in 1997. Rice noodle roll was originated by the Hexianguan Restaurant in Pantang during the Second Sino-Japanese War and it has been a must in Guangzhou's restaurants. Rice noodle roll with beef of Yinji is the most famous type. Rice milk is steamed into rice pellicle with meat smash, fillet and pork liver on it and the pellicle is rolled and then cut apart. Sampan Congee comes from Litchi Bay. It is called Sampan Congee because it was sold by Tanka people on sampans. Its ingredients used to be only river prawns and slices of fish. Now it has become a commonly seen snack and has gradually become a dish served in restaurants and hotels. Its ingredients are unceasingly updated, with salted jellyfish, peanuts and fried vermicelli.

At the time of his death, he was described as the richest man in the South.  Early years  Edmund Richardson was born June 28, 1818, in Caswell County, North Carolina, to James Richardson and Nancy Payne Ware.North Carolina biographical dictionary, second edition. 1999. Somerset Publishers, Inc. p. 506. He was educated in common schools from the age of 10 to 14 but left school in 1832 and clerked in a dry goods store in Danville, Virginia. In 1840, he inherited $2,800 and a few slaves from his father's estate. By his early 20s, Richardson had settled in Jackson, Mississippi, where he formed a mercantile partnership with branch stores in neighboring communities. In 1848, Richardson married Margaret Elizabeth Patton of Huntsville, Alabama, with whom he had seven children.  Civil War economics  When the American Civil War began in 1861, Richardson owned five cotton plantations, as well as country stores in the towns of Brandon, Canton, Jackson, Morton, and Newton, Mississippi. In addition, he was a partner in Thornhill and Company, a New Orleans, cotton factoring firm. They were in the business of judging the quality of cotton, keeping abreast of cotton crop production, and analyzing cotton price trends.Woodman, H.D. 2000. King Cotton and His Retainers: Financing and Marketing the Cotton Crop of the South, 1800‚Äì1925. Beard Books:Washington, DC. 419 p. When the Union's naval blockade closed access to the New Orleans port, Thornhill & Co. was a half-million dollars in debt and had customers who could not pay their credit obligations to the firm. Although the Civil War years caused debt problems for Richardson, at the end of the war he still owned the five plantations and 500 bales of cotton. He marketed his assets, rebounded financially, and was out of debt within a year.David M. Oshinsky. 1996. Worse than slavery: Parchman Farm and the ordeal of Jim Crow justice. Simon & Schuster:New York. 320 p.  Post-war ventures  Since work for former slaves was almost impossible to find after the Civil War, many prisons in the South were overcrowded with vagrants. In 1868, Richardson exploited this abundance of labor by striking a deal with Federal authorities in Mississippi (still under the rule of postwar Reconstruction), to use ex- slave prison inmates to work his farms in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta.Si Kahn and E. K. Minnich. 2005. The fox in the henhouse: how privatization threatens democracy. Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc.: San Francisco, CA. 290 p. Richardson agreed to provide supervisory guards and to treat the prisoners well by providing food and clothing. The state agreed to pay Richardson $18,000 per year for maintenance, plus the cost of transporting prisoners to and from his delta plantation camps. Richardson used the prison laborers to build levees, clear trees from swamps, and plow fields. Production of cotton using the convict lease system allowed Richardson to amass a fortune. By the 1880s, he had a mansion in New Orleans and another in Jackson, Mississippi. He also acquired the Griffin-Spragins mansion in the Mississippi Delta.Fraiser, Jim. 2002. The Majesty of the Mississippi Delta. Pelican Publishing Co.:Gretna, Louisiana. 96 p. Mississippi Mills textile plant, circa 1900. He owned country stores, banks, steamboats, railroads, cotton-seed mills, a cotton commission house in New Orleans (Richardson and May), a controlling interest in the South's largest textile plant (Mississippi Mills) in Wesson, Mississippi, and dozens of cotton plantations in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.Biographical and historical memoirs of Mississippi, Vol. 2. 1891.

In the mid-1880s, Richardson was one of the largest cotton growers in the world with 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) in cultivation and became known as the \\"Cotton King\\". Richardson was frequently referred to by the honorary title of \\"Colonel\\", thought to be granted by the Governor of Mississippi or some political affiliate.Price, Beulah M. D‚ÄôOlive. 1978. The Mississippi-Louisiana career of Colonel Edmund Richardson. Journal of Mississippi History 40(2):183‚Äì190.  Death and legacy  On January 11, 1886, Edmund Richardson was stricken with apoplexy at Jackson, Mississippi, and he died before assistance could arrive. His obituary described him as \\"the richest man in the South and the largest cotton planter in the world, second only to the Khedive of Egypt\\". At the time of his death, his estate was estimated to be worth 10 to 15 million dollars. Edmund Richardson was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson.

A Puritan from his youth, Barnes strove to alleviate the sufferings of the nonconformists in the north during the reign of Charles II, and was for some time imprisoned in Tynemouth Castle for holding prayer meetings in his own house.Information contained in the updated version of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, edited by Matthew, H C G & Harrison, B, 2004, vol 3 states that \\"...[Barnes'] writings themselves perished in a fire at the Literary & Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1893.\\" Barnes was a close friend of Richard Gilpin, Simeon Ashe, Edmund Calamy, and Joseph Caryll, and often met Richard Baxter at the London house of Alderman Henry Ashurst. He died 23 March 1710. Works Barnes wrote a Breviate of the Four Monarchies, an Inquiry into the Nature, Grounds, and Reasons of Religion, and a Censure upon the Times and Age he lived in.

He hated Charles II, whom he saw in London when he presented a petition to the privy council in behalf of the municipal rights of Newcastle, but he showed some respect for James II. Family Barnes married Mary Butler in 1655, and had by her seven children. His eldest son Joseph was recorder of Newcastle from 1687 to 1711, and his son Thomas was minister of the independent congregation from 1698 till his death in 1731.

Life Barnes was a Lancashire man by extraction, if not by birth. He was educated at Oxford University, but after being converted to Catholicism he went to Spain and studied divinity in the University of Salamanca under Juan Alfonso Curiel, who \\"was wont to call Barnes by the name of John Huss, because of a spirit of contradiction which was always observed in him\\". Having resolved to join the Spanish congregation of the Order of St Benedict, he was clothed in St Benedict's monastery at Valladolid 12 March 1604; was professed the next year on 21 March; and was ordained priest 20 September 1608. He was subsequently stationed at Douai and St Malo; and in 1613 the general chapter in Spain nominated him first assistant of the English mission. After he had laboured in this country for some time, he was apprehended and banished into Normandy with several other priests. Invited to the English priory at Dieulwart, in Lorraine, he read a divinity lecture there, and he was next similarly employed in Marchienne College at Douai. Venturing again into England, Barnes resided privately at Oxford in 1627 for the purpose of collecting, in the Bodleian Library, materials for some works which he intended to publish. At this period his brethren regarded him with grave suspicion. He was an enemy to the pope's temporal power; he had attacked the teaching of certain casuists on the subject of equivocation; he had affirmed that prior to the Reformation there never existed any congregation of Benedictines in England, excepting that of the Cluny order; and he had, with Father Francis Walgrave, opposed the coalition in this country of the monks belonging respectively to the Spanish, Italian (Cassinese), and English congregations. Wood relates that his writings \\"made him so much hated by those of his order that endeavours were made to seize upon him and make him an example\\". Barnes, perceiving the danger, fled to Paris, and there placed himself under the protection of the Spanish ambassador. In consequence, however, of the efforts made by Father Clement Reyner and his interest with Albert of Austria, Barnes was carried from Paris by force, was divested of his habit, tied to a horse and hurried away into Flanders (preface to Catholico-Romanus Pacificus). The securing of Father Barnes cost the order 300l. According to Wood he was conveyed from Flanders to Rome, where, by command of the pope, he was, as a contriver of new doctrine, thrust into a dungeon of the Inquisition. His mind giving way, he was removed to a lunatic asylum behind the church of St Paul the Less, and he appears to have been confined there until his death, which occurred in August 1661. \\"If he was in his wits\\", wrote Father Leander Norminton from Rome, \\"he was an heretic; but they gave him Christian burial because they accounted him rather a madman\\". By the reformed party Barnes is described as the good Iren√¶us, a learned, peaceable, and moderate man; but catholic writers, particularly of his own order, condemn his conduct in the severest terms. For example, Dom Bennet Weldon says: \\"I have gathered many letters which show him to have tampered much with the state of England to become its pensioner, to mince the catholic truths that the protestants might digest them without choking, and so likewise to prepare the protestant errors that catholic stomachs might not loathe them. He was hard at work in the prosecution of this admirable project in the years 1625 and 1626. He took upon him in a letter to a nobleman of England, which is without date of year or month, to maintain out of true divinity the separation of England from the court of Rome as things then stood, and the oath of fidelity of the English communion, to be lawful and just according to the writers of the Roman church. And he says at the beginning of this wonderful letter, that he had been about eight years at work to get an opportunity of insinuating himself into his majesty's knowledge\\". Works Barnes wrote the following works: * Examen Troph√¶orum Congregationis Pr√¶tens√¶ Anglican√¶ Ordinis S. Benedicti Rheims, 1622, 8vo. It is a reply to Father Edward Mayhew's Congregationis Anglican√¶ Ordinis S. Benedicti Troph√¶a, Rheims, 1619.

Fox, son of Francis Fox, was born at Brentford in 1675. He entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, as a commoner in April 1698, after having, according to Hearne, served six and a half years of his time as apprentice to a glover in London. He took the degree of B.A. in 1701, and that of M.A. in 1704. In 1705 he was chaplain to the lord mayor, Sir Owen Buckingham, and apparently about this time was 'commonly known as Father Fox'. Bishop Burnet appointed him rector of Boscombe, Wiltshire, in 1708, and promoted him to the vicarage of Potterne in 1711. He was chaplain to Lord Cadogan, and, from 1713 till his death, prebendary of Salisbury. In 1726 the Lord Chancellor presented him to the vicarage of St Mary's in Reading. There he died in July 1738. Politics He was, at any rate for most of his life, a strong Whig, and in 1727 he preached at what was called the Reading lecture a sermon which gave great offence to a number of the clergy who formed the audience. After being repeated as an assize sermon at Abingdon, it was published under the title of Judgment, Mercy, and Fidelity, the Weightier Matters or Duties of the Law (Matt. xxiii. 23). It was considered to undervalue the efficacy of the sacraments, and to depreciate unduly the usefulness of preaching against dissenters. Angry letters about it were exchanged between Fox and the Rev. Joseph Slade of St Laurence's, Reading, who eventually published a sermon in reply to it, with the letters prefixed. This in its turn was attacked by the Rev. Lancelot Carleton in 'A Letter to the Rev. Jos. Slade'.

Energy flow is a unidirectional and noncyclic pathway, whereas the movement of mineral nutrients is cyclic. Mineral cycles include the carbon cycle, sulfur cycle, nitrogen cycle, water cycle, phosphorus cycle, oxygen cycle, among others that continually recycle along with other mineral nutrients into productive ecological nutrition. Outline Fallen logs are critical components of the nutrient cycle in terrestrial forests. Nurse logs form habitats for other creatures that decompose the materials and recycle the nutrients back into production. The nutrient cycle is nature's recycling system. All forms of recycling have feedback loops that use energy in the process of putting material resources back into use. Recycling in ecology is regulated to a large extent during the process of decomposition. Ecosystems employ biodiversity in the food webs that recycle natural materials, such as mineral nutrients, which includes water. Recycling in natural systems is one of the many ecosystem services that sustain and contribute to the well-being of human societies. A nutrient cycle of a typical terrestrial ecosystem. There is much overlap between the terms for the biogeochemical cycle and nutrient cycle. Most textbooks integrate the two and seem to treat them as synonymous terms. However, the terms often appear independently. Nutrient cycle is more often used in direct reference to the idea of an intra-system cycle, where an ecosystem functions as a unit. From a practical point, it does not make sense to assess a terrestrial ecosystem by considering the full column of air above it as well as the great depths of Earth below it. While an ecosystem often has no clear boundary, as a working model it is practical to consider the functional community where the bulk of matter and energy transfer occurs. Nutrient cycling occurs in ecosystems that participate in the \\"larger biogeochemical cycles of the earth through a system of inputs and outputs.\\" Complete and closed loop Ecosystems are capable of complete recycling. Complete recycling means that 100% of the waste material can be reconstituted indefinitely. This idea was captured by Howard T. Odum when he penned that \\"it is thoroughly demonstrated by ecological systems and geological systems that all the chemical elements and many organic substances can be accumulated by living systems from background crustal or oceanic concentrations without limit as to concentration so long as there is available solar or another source of potential energy\\" In 1979 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen proposed the fourth law of entropy stating that complete recycling is impossible. Despite Georgescu- Roegen's extensive intellectual contributions to the science of ecological economics, the fourth law has been rejected in line with observations of ecological recycling. However, some authors state that complete recycling is impossible for technological waste. A simplified food web illustrating a three-trophic food chain (producers-herbivores-carnivores) linked to decomposers. The movement of mineral nutrients through the food chain, into the mineral nutrient pool, and back into the trophic system illustrates ecological recycling. The movement of energy, in contrast, is unidirectional and noncyclic. Ecosystems execute closed loop recycling where demand for the nutrients that adds to the growth of biomass exceeds supply within that system. There are regional and spatial differences in the rates of growth and exchange of materials, where some ecosystems may be in nutrient debt (sinks) where others will have extra supply (sources). These differences relate to climate, topography, and geological history leaving behind different sources of parent material. In terms of a food web, a cycle or loop is defined as \\"a directed sequence of one or more links starting from, and ending at, the same species.\\" An example of this is the microbial food web in the ocean, where \\"bacteria are exploited, and controlled, by protozoa, including heterotrophic microflagellates which are in turn exploited by ciliates. This grazing activity is accompanied by excretion of substances which are in turn used by the bacteria so that the system more or less operates in a closed circuit.\\" Ecological recycling An example of ecological recycling occurs in the enzymatic digestion of cellulose. \\"Cellulose, one of the most abundant organic compounds on Earth, is the major polysaccharide in plants where it is part of the cell walls. Cellulose-degrading enzymes participate in the natural, ecological recycling of plant material.\\" Different ecosystems can vary in their recycling rates of litter, which creates a complex feedback on factors such as the competitive dominance of certain plant species. Different rates and patterns of ecological recycling leaves a legacy of environmental effects with implications for the future evolution of ecosystems. Ecological recycling is common in organic farming, where nutrient management is fundamentally different compared to agri-business styles of soil management. Organic farms that employ ecosystem recycling to a greater extent support more species (increased levels of biodiversity) and have a different food web structure. Organic agricultural ecosystems rely on the services of biodiversity for the recycling of nutrients through soils instead of relying on the supplementation of synthetic fertilizers. The model for ecological recycling agriculture adheres to the following principals: *Protection of biodiversity. *Use of renewable energy. *Recycling of plant nutrients. Where produce from an organic farm leaves the farm gate for the market the system becomes an open cycle and nutrients may need to be replaced through alternative methods. =Ecosystem engineers= An illustration of an earthworm casting taken from Charles Darwin's publication on the movement of organic matter in soils through the ecological activities of worms. From the largest to the smallest of creatures, nutrients are recycled by their movement, by their wastes, and by their metabolic activities. This illustration shows an example of the Roman10\\"> The persistent legacy of environmental feedback that is left behind by or as an extension of the ecological actions of organisms is known as niche construction or ecosystem engineering. Many species leave an effect even after their death, such as coral skeletons or the extensive habitat modifications to a wetland by a beaver, whose components are recycled and re-used by descendants and other species living under a different selective regime through the feedback and agency of these legacy effects. Ecosystem engineers can influence nutrient cycling efficiency rates through their actions. Earthworms, for example, passively and mechanically alter the nature of soil environments. Bodies of dead worms passively contribute mineral nutrients to the soil. The worms also mechanically modify the physical structure of the soil as they crawl about (bioturbation), digest on the molds of organic matter they pull from the soil litter. These activities transport nutrients into the mineral layers of soil. Worms discard wastes that create worm castings containing undigested materials where bacteria and other decomposers gain access to the nutrients. The earthworm is employed in this process and the production of the ecosystem depends on their capability to create feedback loops in the recycling process. Shellfish are also ecosystem engineers because they: 1) Filter suspended particles from the water column; 2) Remove excess nutrients from coastal bays through denitrification; 3) Serve as natural coastal buffers, absorbing wave energy and reducing erosion from boat wakes, sea level rise and storms; 4) Provide nursery habitat for fish that are valuable to coastal economies. Fungi contribute to nutrient cycling and nutritionally rearrange patches of ecosystem creating niches for other organisms. In that way fungi in growing dead wood allow xylophages to grow and develop and xylophages, in turn, affect dead wood, contributing to wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in the forest floor. History Nutrient cycling has a historical foothold in the writings of Charles Darwin in reference to the decomposition actions of earthworms. Darwin wrote about \\"the continued movement of the particles of earth\\". Even earlier, in 1749 Carl Linnaeus wrote in \\"the economy of nature we understand the all-wise disposition of the creator in relation to natural things, by which they are Ô¨Åtted to produce general ends, and reciprocal uses\\" in reference to the balance of nature in his book Oeconomia Naturae. In this book he captured the notion of ecological recycling: \\"The 'reciprocal uses' are the key to the whole idea, for 'the death, and destruction of one thing should always be subservient to the restitution of another;' thus mould spurs the decay of dead plants to nourish the soil, and the earth then 'oÔ¨Äers again to plants from its bosom, what it has received from them.'\\" The basic idea of a balance of nature, however, can be traced back to the Greeks: Democritus, Epicurus, and their Roman disciple Lucretius. Following the Greeks, the idea of a hydrological cycle (water is considered a nutrient) was validated and quantified by Halley in 1687. Dumas and Boussingault (1844) provided a key paper that is recognized by some to be the true beginning of biogeochemistry, where they talked about the cycle of organic life in great detail. From 1836 to 1876, Jean Baptiste Boussingault demonstrated the nutritional necessity of minerals and nitrogen for plant growth and development. Prior to this time influential chemists discounted the importance of mineral nutrients in soil. Ferdinand Cohn is another influential figure. \\"In 1872, Cohn described the 'cycle of life' as the \\"entire arrangement of nature\\" in which the dissolution of dead organic bodies provided the materials necessary for new life. The amount of material that could be molded into living beings was limited, he reasoned, so there must exist an \\"eternal circulation\\" (ewigem kreislauf) that constantly converts the same particle of matter from dead bodies into living bodies.\\" These ideas were synthesized in the Master's research of Sergei Vinogradskii from 1881-1883. =Variations in terminology= In 1926 Vernadsky coined the term biogeochemistry as a sub-discipline of geochemistry. However, the term nutrient cycle pre-dates biogeochemistry in a pamphlet on silviculture in 1899: \\"These demands by no means pass over the fact that at places where sufficient quantities of humus are available and where, in case of continuous decomposition of litter, a stable, nutrient humus is present, considerable quantities of nutrients are also available from the biogenic nutrient cycle for the standing timber. In 1898 there is a reference to the nitrogen cycle in relation to nitrogen fixing microorganisms. Other uses and variations on the terminology relating to the process of nutrient cycling appear throughout history: *The term mineral cycle appears early in a 1935 in reference to the importance of minerals in plant physiology: \\"...ash is probably either built up into its permanent structure, or deposited in some way as waste in the cells, and so may not be free to re-enter the mineral cycle.\\" *The term nutrient recycling appears in a 1964 paper on the food ecology of the wood stork: \\"While the periodic drying up and reflooding of the marshes creates special survival problems for organisms in the community, the fluctuating water levels favor rapid nutrient recycling and subsequent high rates of primary and secondary production\\" *The term natural cycling appears in a 1968 paper on the transportation of leaf litter and its chemical elements for consideration in fisheries management: \\"Fluvial transport of tree litter from drainage basins is a factor in natural cycling of chemical elements and in degradation of the land.\\" *The term ecological recycling appears in a 1968 publication on future applications of ecology for the creation of different modules designed for living in extreme environments, such as space or under sea: \\"For our basic requirement of recycling vital resources, the oceans provide much more frequent ecological recycling than the land area. Fish and other organic populations have higher growth rates, vegetation has less capricious weather problems for sea harvesting.\\" *The term bio-recycling appears in a 1976 paper on the recycling of organic carbon in oceans: \\"Following the actualistic assumption, then, that biological activity is responsible for the source of dissolved organic material in the oceans, but is not important for its activities after death of the organisms and subsequent chemical changes which prevent its bio-recycling, we can see no major difference in the behavior of dissolved organic matter between the prebiotic and post-biotic oceans.\\" Water is also a nutrient. In this context, some authors also refer to precipitation recycling, which \\"is the contribution of evaporation within a region to precipitation in that same region.\\" These variations on the theme of nutrient cycling continue to be used and all refer to processes that are part of the global biogeochemical cycles. However, authors tend to refer to natural, organic, ecological, or bio-recycling in reference to the work of nature, such as it is used in organic farming or ecological agricultural systems. Recycling in Novel Ecosystems An endless stream of technological waste accumulates in different spatial configurations across the planet and turns into a predator in our soils, our streams, and our oceans. This idea was similarly expressed in 1954 by ecologist Paul Sears: \\"We do not know whether to cherish the forest as a source of essential raw materials and other benefits or to remove it for the space it occupies. We expect a river to serve as both vein and artery carrying away waste but bringing usable material in the same channel. Nature long ago discarded the nonsense of carrying poisonous wastes and nutrients in the same vessels.\\" Ecologists use population ecology to model contaminants as competitors or predators. Rachel Carson was an ecological pioneer in this area as her book Silent Spring inspired research into biomagification and brought to the world's attention the unseen pollutants moving into the food chains of the planet. In contrast to the planets natural ecosystems, technology (or technoecosystems) is not reducing its impact on planetary resources. Only 7% of total plastic waste (adding up to millions upon millions of tons) is being recycled by industrial systems; the 93% that never makes it into the industrial recycling stream is presumably absorbed by natural recycling systems In contrast and over extensive lengths of time (billions of years) ecosystems have maintained a consistent balance with production roughly equaling respiratory consumption rates. The balanced recycling efficiency of nature means that production of decaying waste material has exceeded rates of recyclable consumption into food chains equal to the global stocks of fossilized fuels that escaped the chain of decomposition. Microplastics and nanosilver materials flowing and cycling through ecosystems from pollution and discarded technology are among a growing list of emerging ecological concerns. For example, unique assemblages of marine microbes have been found to digest plastic accumulating in the worlds oceans. Discarded technology is absorbed into soils and creates a new class of soils called technosols. Human wastes in the Anthropocene are creating new systems of ecological recycling, novel ecosystems that have to contend with the mercury cycle and other synthetic materials that are streaming into the biodegradation chain. Microorganisms have a significant role in the removal of synthetic organic compounds from the environment empowered by recycling mechanisms that have complex biodegradation pathways. The effect of synthetic materials, such as nanoparticles and microplastics, on ecological recycling systems is listed as one of the major concerns for ecosystem in this century. =Technological recycling= Recycling in human industrial systems (or technoecosystems) differs from ecological recycling in scale, complexity, and organization. Industrial recycling systems do not focus on the employment of ecological food webs to recycle waste back into different kinds of marketable goods, but primarily employ people and technodiversity instead. Some researchers have questioned the premise behind these and other kinds of technological solutions under the banner of 'eco-efficiency' are limited in their capability, harmful to ecological processes, and dangerous in their hyped capabilities. Many technoecosystems are competitive and parasitic toward natural ecosystems. Food web or biologically based \\"recycling includes metabolic recycling (nutrient recovery, storage, etc.) and ecosystem recycling (leaching and in situ organic matter mineralization, either in the water column, in the sediment surface, or within the sediment).\\" See also *Plastic pollution References External links *Soil and Water Conservation Society *Baltic Ecological Recycling Agriculture and Society *Dianna Cohen: Tough truths about plastic pollution on TED.com *Plastic pollution coalition *Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems journal *Nova Scotia Agricultural College lecture notes on nutrient cycling in soil Category:Ecology Category:Systems ecology Category:Recycling Category:Ecological economics ","title":"Nutrient cycle"},{"id":"32086670","title":"Save the Last Chance"},{"id":"32086681","text":"The 1927‚Äì28 Scottish Division One season was won by Rangers by five points over nearest rival Celtic.

In a brief memoir of his uncle (later published by the family's historian Lord Clermont (d.1887)), Faithful Fortescue wrote: \\"With the first Lord Chichester I had, from coming young from school, my education, and by him the foundation of my advancement and fortune I acquired in Ireland\\".Clermont, Lord (d.1887), History of the Family of Fortescue in all its Branches, London, 1880, p.169 In 1604 Sir Arthur Chichester was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, an office which he held until 1616. This was the period of the Plantation of Ulster, and Fortescue acquired offices and lands in the north of Ireland. In 1606 he received a patent for life of the post of Constable of Carrickfergus Castle, otherwise known as Knockfergus Castle, one of the major fortified places in the north of Ireland. A few years later he obtained a grant from the crown comprising an extensive range of territory in County Antrim, which had formerly belonged to the Irish chieftain Rory Oige MacQuillane (Rory Og MacQuillan), which he erected into the \\"manor of Fortescue\\". A part of this land he sold in 1624; the remainder, together with the property of Dromiskin in County Louth, was handed down to his descendants. In the Irish parliament of 1613 there was gerrymandering by the creation of borough and county franchises among the new English and Scottish settlements in Ulster. Fortescue was elected to this parliament as member for Charlemont in the county of Armagh; in the subsequent parliaments of 1634 and 1639 he sat in turn as member for Dungannon and the county of Armagh, while his eldest son Chichester succeeded him as representative for Charlemont. In 1624 he obtained the command of a company in the army raised in England to serve in the Netherlands under Count Mansfeld; but through the interest of Lord Chichester he was permitted to exchange into a regiment then being enlisted in Cumberland and other northern counties of England for service in Ireland. Lord Wentworth, appointed Lord Deputy in July 1633, some months before his arrival in Ireland, commissioned Fortescue to raise a troop of horse, of which he was to have the command. The commission brought with it heavy expenditure and a long series of personal differences with Wentworth (later 1st Earl of Strafford). His troubles began as soon as Wentworth landed in Ireland, when he immediately dismissed, without any pay, forty of the newly enrolled troopers, to make room for the gentlemen and servants he had brought with him; difficulties about payments followed, then refusals to promote Fortescue and his sons, then scandals about his lordship's visits to a ‚Äònoble lady,‚Äô then a personal quarrel. The business ended in a letter from Lord Strafford, after he had left Ireland, during his imprisonment in the Tower of London, ordering his steward to discharge Fortescue from the command of his troop.  Irish rebellion of 1641  In 1640 or 1641 Fortescue petitioned the House of Commons for promotion to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on the Irish establishment. On 27 January 1642 this petition came before the house; on that day a report was received from John Pym, on behalf of the committee for Irish affairs, to the effect that the king had commanded the lord-lieutenant Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, to recommend seven officers to the house for commands in Ireland. The committee recommended Fortescue, the house ‚Äòbeing very well satisfied that he is a man of honour and experience and worthy of such an employment‚Äô. Fortescue received the appointment of Governor of Drogheda during the summer of 1641. In October of that year the Irish Rebellion of 1641 broke out in Ulster. The insurgents were able, without resistance, to seize Newry, Carrick, Charlemont, and other places, and threatened Drogheda, the only fortified town between them and Dublin. The town was not garrisoned, and the only troops Fortescue was able to obtain consisted of sixty-six horse and three companies of foot, raised hurriedly by his brother-in-law, Charles Moore, 2nd Viscount Moore. Finding his body of men inadequate to the defence of the place, Fortescue threw up his commission and went to England for help. Nicholas Bernard, who was in Drogheda during the siege, says of Fortescue on this occasion that, \\"though willing to hazard his life for us, yet he was loath to lose his reputation also\\". Fortescue left behind his eldest son, Chichester Fortescue, who was in command of a company in Lord Moore's regiment, and who died during the siege, and his second son, John Fortescue, who was killed by the rebels. Shortly after his departure Sir Henry Tichborne was appointed by the lords justices governor of the place, and brought to its relief a force of a thousand-foot and a hundred horse. The commissioners of parliament appointed to raise a force for the suppression of the Irish rebellion selected Fortescue in June 1642 for the command of the third troop of horse intended to serve under Lord Wharton, as lord-general of Ireland. In addition to this body of cavalry, Fortescue also raised for service in Ireland a company of infantry, which was attached to the Earl of Peterborough's regiment, and was then compelled to serve with the parliamentary army in England during the civil war.  In action in the First English Civil War  While waiting at Bristol to cross to Ireland, Fortescue's troop was placed under the command of Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. It was marched to the Midlands to take part in the campaign the on the side of the Parliament. Charles I issued a protest against the diversion, naming especially Fortescue and his troop of horse. On the eve of the battle of Edgehill, Fortescue, who was acting as major in Lord Wharton's regiment of horse, tried negotiations with Prince Rupert, and promised to desert. On the next day, when Prince Rupert charged the left wing of the parliamentary army, Fortescue with his troop drew off from the rest of Lord Wharton's regiment and rode over to the royal horse. Many of Fortescue's troopers forgot to throw away orange scarfs worn as the Earl of Essex's colours, and eighteen out of the sixty men of the troop were killed or wounded by the cavalry whom they had joined. Soon after the battle, Fortescue was appointed to the command of the 10th regiment of the royal infantry, and served with the army whose headquarters were at Oxford during the remainder of the civil war.  Later royalist service  In 1647 he accompanied the Marquis of Ormonde during his Irish campaign, and remained with him until the retreat of the royal army from Dublin to Drogheda. He made his way to the Isle of Man, and thence crossed to Wales. At Beaumaris he was arrested and imprisoned by order of the House of Commons, first at Denbigh Castle, and afterwards at Carnarvon Castle. He was able to join Charles II at Stirling in the spring of 1651, and took part in the campaign which ended in the battle of Worcester.  Later life  Fortescue went to the continent, where he remained, at first in France, and afterwards in the Netherlands, until the English Restoration. By royal warrant of 21 August 1660 he was restored to the post of Constable of Carrickfergus Castle, an office which he was permitted to transfer a few months later to his eldest surviving son, Sir Thomas Fortescue, and was created a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber. This office attached him to the royal court, and he lived mainly in London.  Death and burial  He sought refuge on the Isle of Wight from the Great Plague of London in 1665 and died there in the manor-house of Bowcombe, near Carisbrooke, in May 1666, being more than eighty-five years of age, and was buried at Carisbrooke Church. No contemporary monument survives, although his descendant and the historian of the Fortescue family Lord Clermont erected a brass tablet on the wall on the north side of Carisbrooke Church inscribed as follows: :\\"In memory of Colonel Sir Faithful Fortescue, Knight, son of John Fortescue, Esquire, of Buckland-Filleigh in Devon, by Susannah, daughter of Sir John Chichester of Raleigh. He was a distinguished Royalist officer, and fought in several battles of the Great Civil War. At the Restoration he became a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to King Charles II. Having left London to avoid the contagion of the plague, he retired to this island, and soon afterwards, being then of a great age, died at the manor of Bowcombe in this parish, and was buried within these precints on the 29th day of May, A.D. 1666. This tablet is placed here by his eldest male representative, Thomas (Fortescue) Lord Clermont, A.D. 1866\\"Clermont, p.198 Memorial to Faithful Fortescue in St Mary's Church, Carisbrooke, Isle of Wight In addition in 1878 Lord Clermont and his younger brother Lord Carlingford erected in his memory a stained glass window in Buckland Filleigh Church in Devon, next to the manor house in which he was born, inscribed as follows:Clermont, p.198 :\\"To the memory of Sir Faithful Fortescue, Knight, son of John Fortefcue, Esquire of Buckland-Filleigh, and of his wife Susannah Chichester of Raleigh, an officer distinguished in the great Civil War, who died at Carisbrook in the Isle of Wight, A.D. 1666, and was buried there, this window is dedicated by his lineal descendants Thomas Fortescue, Lord Clermont, and Chichester Fortescue, Lord Carlingford, A.D. 1878.\\"  Marriage and progeny  Fortescue married twice: *Firstly to Anne Moore (d.1634), a daughter of Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore (ancestor of the Marquis of Drogheda).Clermont, p.170 She died on 5 September 1634 and was buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral.Clermont, p.170 By her he had 16 children (5 of whom died young) ten sons and six daughtersClermont, p.170 including: **Chichester Fortescue (d.1641), of Donoughmore, County Down,Clermont, p.182 eldest son and heir apparent, who succeeded his father as Member of Parliament for Charlemont.Clermont, p.182 He trained as a lawyer at the Inner Temple and married Elizabeth Slingsby (d.1695), daughter of Sir William Slingsby, of Kippax in Yorkshire, who survived him and remarried to John Villiers, Viscount Purbeck, brother of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.Clermont,p.199 By his first wife he had one child: ***Elizabeth Fortescue (d.1705), who married Sir Richard Graham of Norton Conyers, near Ripon, and was the ancestress of Sir Reginald Graham (fl.1869).

Biography Avezzana served under Napoleon I from 1813 until the fall of the empire, and then, joining the Sardinian army, found himself in 1815 arrayed against his old leader, who had made his escape from Elba. His American career began soon after the restoration of Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throne in September 1823. Avezzana fought against the restoration, was captured, was held for several weeks as a prisoner, and sailed for America on being set free. Hardly was he fairly established on American soil when he found himself called upon to defend the state of Tamaulipas against his old enemies the Spaniards, who invaded the territory under General Barradas in June 1827. He was obliged to retire at first before superior numbers, but he soon rallied a force sufficient to overthrow the invaders and afterward resumed his peaceful vocations. In 1832, a revolution was organized by Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna against the government of Anastasio Bustamante, and Avezzana was, as always, ready to lead the revolt. Left in command at Tampico by General Montezuma, who went to stir up the revolutionists elsewhere, he maneuvered so successfully with a small force that they captured three times their number of government troops at Ciudad Victoria, with artillery and supplies. From this time, he gave the enemy no rest, but retrieved the disasters that had befallen Santa Anna and Montezuma, and mainly through his able military leadership the liberal cause triumphed. Avezzana immediately resigned his command, and in 1834, he went into business in New York City, where he married an Irish lady and led a quiet mercantile life until the revolutions of 1848, when he promptly responded to the call of Italy. He was absent just a year, and he only returned to America after he had fought the Austrians and Sardinians at Genoa, and with a few thousand followers had defended Rome for two months against the allied armies, 100,000 strong. Once he sought refuge on board an American and once on board a British man-of-war, and at last, when the cause of freedom was hopelessly crushed, escaped with his usual good luck to America and resumed his mercantile life in New York.

According to the saga, Lyngbakr would bait seafarers by posing as a heather-covered island, and when a crew landed on his back, he sank into the sea, drowning the crew. √ñrvar-Odds saga As √ñrvar-Oddr and his crew were sailing southwesterly through the Greenland Sea in vengeance against the troll √ñgmundr Floki, slayer of Eythjof, the deck officer Vignir knew this area would be dangerous, and made Oddr agree to sail the ship beginning the next day, to which Oddr requested Vignir advise him. As they sailed, they spotted two rocks which rose out of the water. The presence of these rocks puzzled Oddr. Later, they passed by a large island covered in heather. Curious, Oddr made up his mind to turn back and send five men to check out the island, but as they approached where the island had been before, they saw that it and the two rocks vanished. Vignir explained to Oddr that, had they landed sooner, the crew would have surely drowned. The \\"rocks\\" and \\"island\\" must have been two sea monsters‚ÄîLyngbakr, the greatest whale in the world, and hafgufa, who bore all the monsters in the sea.

But Wayne's big movie break came when she starred opposite Jack Lemmon and Peter Falk in the 1967 romantic comedy Luv. She followed this up with an appearance in The Comic (1969) with Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney. Her last appearance came in the 1972 TV supernatural drama The Night Strangler.

He is probably best known for his work with the Seattle-based band Green Apple Quick Step. He briefly fronted the band Devilhead and helped form Calm Down Juanita. Biography Ty Willman was a founding member of the Tacoma, Washington-based band Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys, which he fronted, with guitarists Steve Ross and Dan Kempthorne, drummer Bob Martin and bassist Eric Munday. They recorded a limited edition 7\\" purple vinyl 4-song EP, called Another World and released 700 numbered copies of it on Aroma Records in 1989. By 1992 that band had become Seattle's Green Apple Quick Step, with mostly the same personnel and a new bassist. Willman, guitarists Kempthorn and Ross, drummer Bob 'Mink' Martin, and a new singer-bassist, Mari Ann Braeden, went on to record three albums, releasing only the first two: Wonderful Virus in 1993, and Reloaded in 1995, both on The Medicine Label. Always involved in many side-projects, Willman worked on Mike McCready's project, $10,000 Gold Chain; a collaboration that also included Mari Ann Braeden and produced the song Oh! Sweet Nuthin' for the 1996 soundtrack to the film The Cable Guy and he worked with the rest of GAQS on writing and performing Dizzy for the 1995 soundtrack to the film The Basketball Diaries. He sang with Devilhead, with Kevin Wood and former members of Hater, recording lead vocals for one song, Buying Milk, on their album Pest Control, released in 1996 on Loosegroove Records. He recorded backing vocals on The Skies Magnify Me, with Brandon and Ben Curtis and Joseph Butcher for UFOFU, on their CD UFOFU, released on the Medicine Label in 1997. Willman and session drummer kevtone formed the Seattle-based studio band Calm Down Juanita, a writing collaboration that produced two albums; an eponymous 7-song debut EP in 1998, and a full-length CD in 2002, entitled Undertown. These albums featured several other notable musicians, including, again, fellow GAQS member, bassist Mari Ann Braeden, bassist and recording engineer Steve Feasley, Josh Freese, Stone Gossard, bassist Cole Peterson, and saxophonist Skerik. Starting in 1998, Willman also worked with Stone Gossard on Gossard's first solo album, Bayleaf, recording during Gossard's visits to Willman's house and released in 2001.Stout, Gene. \\"Gossard Picks Up the Mike on Solo Album\\". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. September 11, 2001. Willman sang lead vocals on three songs, Cadillac, Unhand Me, and Fend It Off, as well as background vocals on the rest of the album. Willman also formed a number of other projects. In July 1999, he and former Gigolo Aunt, Phil Hurley formed Hula Bess. He wrote Leaving California; recorded with Shawn Smith on guitar and bass guitar and Michael Shrieve on drums, for Smith's 2003 album, Shield of Thorns, released on Establishmentstore Records. He was frontman for the band Novatone, for its 2005 album release on Wax Orchard Records, Time Can't Wait, which also featured Dave Krusen and Cody Davis, as well as a guest appearance by Shawn Smith. Later, in 2007-2008, he formed Mass Sugar, which was referred to as a \\"part acoustic indie rock, part groovy jam band\\". In 2009, he reconstituted Green Apple Quick Step for a few 2010 \\"reunion\\" performances, including gigs at Tacoma's Hell's Kitchen and Seattle's Crocodile Caf√©. Their lineup as of May 2010 consisted of Willman on lead vocals, Christa Wells on vocals, Dana Turner on guitar, Geoff Reading on drums, and guest guitarist Mike Squires.

They exist in places that have been altered in structure and function by human agency. Novel ecosystems are part of the human environment and niche (including urban, suburban, and rural), they lack natural analogs, and they have extended an influence that has converted more than three- quarters of wild Earth. These anthropogenic biomes include technoecosystems that are fuelled by powerful energy sources (fossil and nuclear) including ecosystems populated with technodiversity, such as roads and unique combinations of soils called technosols. Vegetation associations on old buildings or along field boundary stone walls in old agricultural landscapes are examples of sites where research into novel ecosystem ecology is developing. Overview Human society has transformed the planet to such an extent that we may have ushered in a new epoch known as the anthropocene. The ecological niche of the anthropocene contains entirely novel ecosystems that include technosols, technodiversity, anthromes, and the technosphere. These terms describe the human ecological phenomena marking this unique turn in the evolution of Earth's history. The total human ecosystem (or anthrome) describes the relationship of the industrial technosphere to the ecosphere. Technoecosystems interface with natural life-supporting ecosystems in competitive and parasitic ways. Odum (2001) attributes this term to a 1982 publication by Zev Naveh: \\"Current urban-industrial society not only impacts natural life-support ecosystems, but also has created entirely new arrangements that we can call techno-ecosystems, a term believed to be first suggested by Zev Neveh (1982). These new systems involve new, powerful energy sources (fossil and atomic fuels), technology, money, and cities that have little or no parallels in nature.\\" The term technoecosystem, however, appears earliest in print in a 1976 technical report and also appears in a book chapter (see in Lamberton and Thomas (1982) written by Kenneth E. Boulding). Novel Ecosystems Novel ecosystems \\"differ in composition and/or function from present and past systems\\". Novel ecosystems are the hallmark of the recently proposed anthropocene epoch. They have no natural analogs due to human alterations on global climate systems, invasive species, a global mass extinction, and disruption of the global nitrogen cycle. Novel ecosystems are creating many different kinds of dilemmas for terrestrial and marine conservation biologists. On a more local scale, abandoned lots, agricultural land, old buildings, field boundary stone walls or residential gardens provide study sites on the history and dynamics of ecology in novel ecosystems. =Anthropogenic biomes= Ellis (2008) identifies twenty-one different kinds of anthropogenic biomes that sort into the following groups: 1) dense settlements, 2) villages, 3) croplands, 4) rangeland, 5) forested, and 6) wildlands. These anthropogenic biomes (or anthromes for short) create the technosphere that surrounds us and are populated with diverse technologies (or technodiversity for short). Within these anthromes the human species (one species out of billions) appropriates 23.8% of the global net primary production. \\"This is a remarkable impact on the biosphere caused by just one species.\\" =Noosphere= Noosphere (sometimes no√∂sphere) is the \\"sphere of human thought\\".Georgy S.

In 1936 Vernadsky presented on the idea of the Noosphere in a letter to Boris Leonidovich Lichkov (though, he states that the concept derives from Le Roy). =Technosphere= The technosphere is the part of the environment on Earth where technodiversity extends its influence into the biosphere. \\"For the development of suitable restoration strategies, a clear distinction has to be made between different functional classes of natural and cultural solar- powered biosphere and fossil-powered technosphere landscapes, according to their inputs and throughputs of energy and materials, their organisms, their control by natural or human information, their internal self-organization and their regenerative capacities.\\" The weight of Earth's technosphere has been calculated as 30 trillion tons, a mass greater than 50 kilos for every square metre of the planet's surface. =Technoecosystems= The concept of technoecosystems has been pioneered by ecologists Howard T. Odum and Zev Naveh. Technoecosystems interface with and are competitive toward natural systems. They have advanced technology (or technodiversity) money-based market economies and have a large ecological footprints. Technoecosystems have far greater energy requirements than natural ecosystems, excessive water consumption, and release toxic and eutrophicating chemicals. Other ecologists have defined the extensive global network of road systems as a type of technoecosystem. =Technoecotypes= \\"Bio-agro- and techno-ecotopes are spatially integrated in larger, regional landscape units, but they are not structurally and functionally integrated in the ecosphere. Because of the adverse impacts of the latter and the great human pressures on bio-ecotopes, they are even antagonistically related and therefore cannot function together as a coherent, sustainable ecological system.\\" =Technosols= Technosols are a new form of ground group in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). Technosols are \\" mainly characterised by anthropogenic parent material of organic and mineral nature and which origin can be either natural or technogenic.\\" =Technodiversity= Technodiversity refers to the varied diversity of technological artifacts that exist in technoecosystems.

Gertrude and her husband, artist Balcomb Greene, were heavily involved in political activism to promote mainstream acceptance of abstract art. They were founding members of the American Abstract Artists organization. Family life Gertrude Glass was the daughter of Siegfried and Berta Glass who owned a department store in Brooklyn, New York. After completing high school, Gertrude went to evening sculpture classes at the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in New York City where she met other students who were interested in the new abstract style of art. Glass married Balcomb Greene in 1926 after he graduated from Syracuse University, and traveled with him to Vienna, Austria, where he pursued graduate studies in psychology. The couple moved back to New York in 1927 where Balcomb attended Columbia University to study for a master's degree in English literature, while she continued study sculpture. Balcomb moved to Hanover, New Hampshire where he taught literature from 1928 to 1931 at Dartmouth College. Initially, Gertrude joined Balcomb in New Hampshire where she had a sculpture studio. But she preferred living in New York so left New Hampshire without Balcomb. After he quit teaching at Dartmouth, the couple traveled to Paris, France, for a year where for the only time during their marriage they shared a studio. Artist Greene was one of the earliest American artists, possibly the first, to produce non-objective relief sculptures in the early 1930s. She synthesized Cubist and Russian Constructivists themes into her work. By the 1940s, her work showed her interest in Mondrian and Neo-Plasticism. She produced her last sculpture in 1946 and for the rest of life she concentrated on abstract painting. Nonetheless, her paintings never completely lost a \\"sense of architectural structure\\".Jacqueline Moss, \\"Gertrude Greene: Constructions of the 1930s and 1940s\\", Arts Magazine (April 1981), p. 126 Grace Borgenicht Gallery had the first solo exhibition of her work in 1951, and another was held at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in 1955. A painting of Greene's was chosen for the cover of Arts Magazine in April 1982, which featured an article about Greene's paintings, written by Jacqueline Moss. There was a retrospective of her work at ACA Gallery in 1982. Greene's work can be found in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Brooklyn Museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Berkshire Museum. Political activism Greene supported many liberal political causes affecting artists. She \\"encouraged the formation of WPA programs to help struggling artists\\" and was \\"an active member of the Federation of Painters and Sculptors, the Artists' Union, and a founding member of American Abstract Artists.\\" Gertrude worked as a gallery attendant at the AAA's first annual exhibition, and was the group's first paid employee. The Greenes were active with the AAA committees, and worked to gain acceptance of abstract art by picketing museums that did not feature works of abstract artist.

Founded by Llibio in the sixth century, the church served a small community of bondmen as a chapel of ease. The population of Llanllibio declined substantially during the Middle Ages as a result of the Black Death and changes in farming practice, amongst other factors, and the community that the church served effectively disappeared. As a result, St Llibio's closed in the seventeenth century; the remaining worshippers moved to another local church. Plans in the nineteenth century to rebuild the church, which was in ruins by 1776, came to nothing. Except for a memorial stone, nothing more than \\"tiny traces\\" of St Llibio's can now be seen. Early history St Llibio's was the church for Llanllibio in Anglesey, north Wales. A survey of Anglesey conducted in 1352 records Llanllibio as a township, a Welsh form of land tenure in which the inhabitants, who were generally few in number, were bondmen working for the lord in return for a small arable holding and some grazing rights.Carr, pp. 12‚Äì14. It was the only township in Anglesey to have a church.Carr, p. 18. Like many other communities in Anglesey, and elsewhere in medieval Wales, Llanllibio's population decreased substantially during the Middle Ages, and the settlement effectively disappeared. Communities such as Llanllibio were affected by the Black Death, the destruction resulting from the revolt of Owen Glyndwr, by changes in land tenure, and by new farming practices that reduced the need for tied labour.Carr, pp. 15‚Äì16. The parish was on the old road between London and the Anglesey port town of Holyhead, and about from Bodedern. The church was dedicated to St Llibio, a sixth-century monk, confessor, and disciple of the Anglesey saint Cybi. Llibio himself is recorded as having founded a church on the site, and his feast day was celebrated on 28 February. The area took its name from the church: the Welsh word \\"\\" originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\". St Llibio's was used as a chapel of ease to the Church of St Afran, St Ieuan and St Sannan, Llantrisant, about away. Closure St Llibio's was closed in the seventeenth century, and the church at Llantrisant was enlarged to accommodate worshippers from Llanllibio. By 1776 St Llibio's was in ruins. According to Angharad Llwyd, a historian of Anglesey writing in 1833, the inhabitants of the area attended worship at St Edern's Church, Bodedern. She noted that Wynne Jones, the rector of Llantrisant, hoped to rebuild the church, but that did not happen. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire stated that \\"the church has entirely disappeared, but the foundations of the churchyard wall are still visible.\\" A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that \\"only tiny traces\\" of the church can be seen, adding that a memorial slate marks its location.

From 2011 until late 2012, VUU was affiliated with the University of Buckingham (UB) in the United Kingdom, which awarded the majority of degrees offered at VUU. VUU, however, has developed a number of courses that it teaches and examines independently of UB. The degree certificates of the VUU courses are awarded by VUU. VUU was accredited by the Uganda National Council for Higher Education in October 2010. In 2012, the affiliation with UB was terminated. In September 2013, VUU was purchased for an undisclosed sum by Sudhir Ruparelia, ranked the wealthiest individual in East Africa, by Forbes magazine in 2012. VUU then became a member of the Ruparelia Group. Its campus relocated to Eagen Mansions, at 1-13 Jinja Road, in Kampala's central business district, which was renamed \\"Victoria Towers\\".

The third season premiered on September 22, 2008, and was released on DVD on September 1, 2009. Within the seasons of Heroes are \\"volumes\\", which allow the writers to focus on shorter story arcs. The third season comprised 25 episodes that aired in two blocks generally without reruns. The first 13 episodes of the season made up the third volume, Villains, and the final 12 comprise the fourth volume, Fugitives. The season premiered on September 22, 2008 in the United States on NBC and on Global in Canada, with a one-hour clip-show and two regular episodes. The DVD and Blu-ray were released on September 1, 2009 in the United States and Canada. Plot \\"Villains\\", the season's first volume, began with the assassination attempt on Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar) by Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia) from the future, and explores its consequences. In addition, several villains with abilities escape from the Company's prisons. Some of them join forces with Arthur Petrelli (Robert Forster) (Peter's and Nathan's father) at Pinehearst Company, who wants to find a formula that gives ordinary people abilities in order to make the world a better place. Character arcs involve Tracy Strauss (Ali Larter) discovering her origins, Sylar (Zachary Quinto) trying to decide his loyalties, Peter losing his ability, Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) giving himself an ability, and Hiro Nakamura's (Masi Oka) discovery of a family secret. The second part of season three, titled \\"Fugitives\\", involves what happens after Nathan fails to produce the formula. After the destruction of Primatech and Pinehearst, the heroes attempt to lead normal lives until Nathan tells the President of the United States (Michael Dorn) about people with abilities, and runs a government force, headed by Emile Danko (≈Ωeljko Ivanek), to round them up. Micah Sanders (Noah Gray-Cabey), posing as \\"Rebel\\", starts to help people with abilities hide from the government. Meanwhile, Sylar searches for his father (John Glover).

Its site has yet to be discovered. It may have been situated south-east of Lake Tuz, possibly on the mound of Acemh√∂y√ºk (located at the village of Ye≈üilova, Aksaray) approximately north-west of the city of Aksaray. Another possible location is the mound of Karah√∂y√ºk near Konya. The city is prominently mentioned in the Cappadocian Texts, a collection of Hittite writings unearthed at Kanesh. They depict it as a major seat of power in the region, describing its ruler as \\"Great King\\" (rubƒÅ'um rabi'um) whereas other rulers are merely \\"kings\\". A separate text known as the \\"King of Battle\\" (≈°ar tamhƒÅri), dating to the 14th century BC, recounts a heavily embellished account of the Akkadian king Sargon carrying out an expedition against Purushanda's ruler Nur-Dagan (or Nur-Daggal). The story is ahistorical, as it apparently portrays the 23rd-century Sargon in an anachronistic 19th-century BC setting. Some modern scholars consider it a work of fiction, although the Akkadian language version was also found among the Amarna letters (Egypt), and it may have some basis in historical fact. In the story, Sargon yearns for battle but is advised against it by his generals. Nonetheless, when a message arrives from a group of Akkadian merchants in Purushanda pleading for help from Sargon against the oppressive Nur-Dagan, the king mobilises his army and marches off through difficult terrain. Nur-Dagan is hopeful that flooding and the terrain will thwart Sargon, but the Akkadian launches a lightning attack which captures Purushanda. Nur-Dagan is taken prisoner and grovels before Sargon, declaring him to be a peerless mighty king and perhaps swearing allegiance as a vassal. After three years the Akkadians leave, taking with them the fruits of the land as spoils of war. Purushanda features again in the stories of the campaigns of the 17th century BC Hittite ruler Anitta. The Purushandan kingdom appears to have been a significant rival of Kanesh, the kingdom ruled by Anitta. The Hittite king launched a war against Purushanda but according to the Anitta Text, a Hittite account of later date, the Purushandan king surrendered to the Hittite army:Bryce, p. 39 :When I went into battle, the Man of Purushanda brought gifts to me; he brought to me a throne of iron and a sceptre of iron as a gift. But when I returned to Nesa [Kanesh] I took the Man of Purushanda with me. As soon as he enters the chamber, that man will sit before me on the right.Anitta Text, 73-9. Quoted in Bryce, p. 39 The text indicates that the right to rule over Purushanda's territory ‚Äì symbolised by the regalia of office, the throne and sceptre ‚Äì was surrendered to Anitta. Its king was reduced to the status of a privileged vassal, entitled to join Anitta at the court in Kanesh in recognition of his voluntary surrender and his high-born status. The kingdom itself probably ceased to exist at this point and was absorbed into Hittite-ruled territory.

It was founded in 1995 by Robin Tucek and John Lamond, and named after historic Scottish figure Bishop John Blackadder. The company's bottlings are generally from single casks, are neither chill-filtered nor colored, and are bottled in clear glass to allow customers to see the natural color of the whisky. Bottling series offered by Blackadder include the standard single-cask single malt whiskies, the \\"Limited Edition\\" range, the sherry-cask \\"Old Man of Hoy\\", the \\"Auld Edinburgh\\" range, and two alternate labelings used in place of the Blackadder name: \\"Aberdeen Distillers\\" and \\"The Clydesdale Original Scotch Whisky Co. Ltd.\\" Since 2000, Blackadder has also offered the \\"Raw Cask\\" series, which consists of whisky bottled directly from the cask, without even mechanical filtering. The lack of filtering leaves some detritus in the bottles including fragments of cask wood. In 2014 Blackadder introduced a range of whiskies called Black Snake. These whiskies are produced using a Solera system, where aged single malts are placed into either an Oloroso or PX Sherry cask for further aging. When deemed ready, 2/3 of the cask is drawn to be bottled and the cask is replenished with more single malt for further maturation. Each draw for bottling is known as a \\"Venom\\". Blackadder Whiskies are available in a number of countries, particularly Japan, Taiwan and Europe. In the US, Blackadder Whiskies are imported by Glass Revolution.

In the very late stages of AGB evolution, a star develops a super-wind with extreme mass loss. The gas in the stellar wind condenses as it cools away from the star, forming molecules such as water (H2O) and silicon monoxide (SiO). This can form grains of dust, mostly silicates, which obscure the star at shorter wavelengths, leading to a strong infrared source. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals can be produced by photodissociation or collisional dissociation. H2O and OH can both be pumped to produce maser emission. OH masers in particular can give rise to a powerful maser action at 1612 MHz and this is regarded as a defining feature of the OH/IR stars. Many other AGB stars such as Mira variables show weaker OH masers at other wavelengths, such as 1667MHz or 22MHz.

The concept of this home of the immortals was later handed down to the Babylonians who conquered Sumer. Location = Persian Gulf = A Sumerian paradise is usually associated with the Dilmun civilization of Eastern Arabia. Sir Henry Rawlinson first suggested the geographical location of Dilmun was in Bahrain in 1880. This theory was later promoted by Frederich Delitzsch in his book Wo lag das Paradies in 1881, suggesting that it was at the head of the Persian Gulf. Various other theories have been put forward on this theme. Dilmun is first mentioned in association with Kur (mountain) and this is particularly problematic as Bahrain is very flat, having a highest prominence of only elevation. Also, in the early epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the construction of the ziggurats in Uruk and Eridu are described as taking place in a world \\"before Dilmun had yet been settled\\". In 1987, Theresa Howard- Carter realized that the locations in this area possess no archaeological evidence of a settlement dating 3300-2300 BC. She proposed that Dilmun could have existed in different eras and the one of this era might be a still unidentified tell. = Lebanon and Mount Hermon = Mount Hermon In tablet nine of the standard version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh travels to the garden of the gods through the Cedar Forest and the depths of Mashu, a comparable location in Sumerian version is the \\"Mountain of cedar- felling\\".Gilgame≈° and ·∏™uwawa (Version A) - Translation, Lines 9A & 12, kur- jicerin-kud Little description remains of the \\"jewelled garden\\" of Gilgamesh because twenty four lines of the myth were damaged and could not be translated at that point in the text. Cedars of Lebanon, sometimes connected with the Sumerian \\"garden of the gods\\". Bohl has highlighted that the word Mashu in Sumerian means \\"twins\\". Jensen and Zimmern thought it to be the geographical location between Mount Lebanon and Mount Hermon in the Anti-Lebanon range. Edward Lipinski and Peter Kyle McCarter have suggested that the garden of the gods relates to a mountain sanctuary in the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges.Lipinski, Edward. \\"El‚Äôs Abode. Mythological Traditions Related to Mount Hermon and to the Mountains of Armenia\\", Orientalia Lovaniensia periodica 2, 1971. Other scholars have found a connection between the Cedars of Lebanon and the garden of the gods. The location of garden of the gods is close to the forest, which is described in the line: = Eridu = Tell mound at Eridu with temple dedicated to the gods Theophilus Pinches suggested in 1908 that Eridu was the Sumerian paradise calling it \\"not the earthly city of that name, but a city conceived as lying also \\"within the Abyss\\", containing a tree of life fed by the Euphrates river. Pinches noted \\"it was represented as a place to which access was forbidden, for 'no man entered its midst', as in the case of the garden of Eden after the fall.\\" In a myth called the Incantation of Eridu, it is described as having a \\"glorious fountain of the abyss\\", a \\"house of wisdom\\", sacred grove and a kiskanu-tree with the appearance of lapis-lazuli. Fu ºƒÅd Safar also found the remains of a canal running through Eridu in archaeological excavations of 1948 to 1949. William Foxwell Albright noted that \\"Eridu is employed as a name of the Abzu, just as Kutu (Kutha), the city of Nergal, is a common name of Aralu\\" highlighting the problems in translation where several places were called the same name.Albright, W. F., The Mouth of the Rivers, The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, Vol. 35, No. 4 (Jul., 1919), pp. 161-195 Alfred Jeremias suggested that Aralu was the same as Ariel in the West Bank and signified both the mountain of the gods and a place of desolation. As with the word Ekur, this has suggested that ideas associated with the netherworld came from a mountainous country outside of Babylonia. = Nippur = The myth of Enlil and Ninlil opens with a description of the city of Nippur, its walls, river, canals and well, portrayed as the home of the gods and, according to Kramer \\"that seems to be conceived as having existed before the creation of man.\\" Andrew R. George suggests \\"Nippur was a city inhabited by gods not men, and this would suggest that it had existed from the very beginning.\\" He discusses Nippur as the \\"first city\\" (uru-sag, \\"City-top\\" or \\"head\\") of Sumer. This conception of Nippur is echoed by Joan Goodnick Westenholz, describing the setting as \\"civitas dei\\", existing before the \\"axis mundi\\". George also noted that a ritual garden was re-created in the \\"Grand Garden of Nippur, most probably a sacred garden in the E-kur (or Dur-an-ki) temple complex, is described in a cult-song of Enlil as a \\"garden of heavenly joy\\". Temples in Mesopotamia were also known to have adorned their ziggurats with a sanctuary and sacred grove of trees, reminiscent of the Hanging gardens of Babylon. Mythology = Kesh temple hymn = In the Kesh temple hymn, the first recorded description (c. 2600 BC) of a domain of the gods is described as being the color of a garden: \\"The four corners of heaven became green for Enlil like a garden.\\" In an earlier translation of this myth by George Aaron Barton in Miscellaneous Babylonian Inscriptions he considered it to read \\"In hursag the garden of the gods was green.\\" = Debate between sheep and grain = Another Sumerian creation myth, the Debate between sheep and grain opens with a location \\"the hill of heaven and earth\\", and describes various agricultural developments in a pastoral setting. This is discussed by Edward Chiera as \\"not a poetical name for the earth, but the dwelling place of the gods, situated at the point where the heavens rest upon the earth. It is there that mankind had their first habitat, and there the Babylonian Garden of Eden is to be placed.\\" The Sumerian word Edin, means \\"steppe\\" or \\"plain\\", so modern scholarship has abandoned the use of the phrase \\"Babylonian Garden of Eden\\" as it has become clear the \\"Garden of Eden\\" was a later concept. = Epic of Gilgamesh = The Epic of Gilgamesh describes Gilgamesh travelling to a wondrous garden of the gods that is the source of a river, next to a mountain covered in cedars, and references a \\"plant of life\\". In the myth, paradise is identified as the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, Utnapishtim (Ziusudra), was taken by the gods to live forever. Once in the garden of the gods, Gilgamesh finds all sorts of precious stones, similar to Genesis 2:12: = Enki and Ninhursag = The myth of Enki and Ninhursag also describes the Sumerian paradise as a garden, which Enki obtains water from Utu to irrigate. = Song of the hoe = The song of the hoe features Enlil creating mankind with a hoe and the Anunnaki spreading outward from the original garden of the gods. It also mentions the Abzu being built in Eridu. = Hymn to Enlil = A Hymn to Enlil praises the leader of the Sumerian pantheon in the following terms: Later usage The word for Paradise garden in much later Persian literature is pairi-Daeza, meaning \\"garden\\" or \\"walled enclosure\\" or \\"orchard\\". The Arabic word for paradise or garden in the Qur'an is Jannah which literally means \\"concealed place\\". Two watercourses are supposed to flow underneath the jannah where large trees are described, mountains made of musk, between which rivers flow in valleys of pearl and ruby.\\"Jannah\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam Online Features of this garden of paradise are told in a parable in the . Islamic gardens can further divide the watercourses into four, meeting at a spring and including a sanctuary for shade and rest. In myths of the Greater Iranian culture and tradition, Jamshid is described as saving the world by building a magical garden on top of a mountain. This garden also features a tree of life and is the source of a river that brings fertility to the land. Jamshid is warned by Ahura Mazda about a freezing winter approaching and so creates this enclosure to protect the seeds of life when a climatic catastrophe strikes.

Biography He received his BA cum laude in 1930, a PhD in Physics in 1934, and a degree in Business Administration in 1935, all from Harvard University. In the 1930s he worked at the Spectrophotometric Laboratory at the Calco Chemical Division of the American Cyanamid Company. =Atomic bomb= In 1942 he joined the staff of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, where he worked in the Liaison Office, processing technical information obtained from overseas and routing it to divisions within US government research where it could be useful. In May 1942 he was chosen by his boss, Vannevar Bush, to be part of S-1 Section, which would become the Manhattan Project to make the atomic bomb. Shurcliff's role was specifically to be a censor of patents: he would review patent applications from the private sector which appeared to impinge on topics being developed in secret by the government, and put them under temporary secrecy orders. As he put it, his job was to \\"locate, examine, and make secret all non- gov‚Äôt-controlled U.S. patent applications related to S-1 (the atomic bomb).\\" Through October 1944, he \\"put to sleep\\" (as he put it) at least 131 patent applications from 95 separate inventors.Alex Wellerstein, \\"Patenting the Bomb: Nuclear Weapons, Intellectual Property, and Technological Control\\" _Isis_ 99 (2008): 57‚Äì87. He later served as an assistant to Richard Tolman, another physicist working on the Manhattan Project, helping to copyedit the Smyth Report, the first official history of the Manhattan Project. In 1946, he serve as the official historian to Operation Crossroads, the first postwar nuclear test series. In the late 1940s, he worked for Polaroid Corporation, where \\"he worked extensively in optics, held more than 20 patents and refined the automatic-focus slide projector.\\" =Polarized light= In 1962 Harvard University Press published Polarized Light: Production and Use which made an extensive review of the subject and included thirty pages of enumerative bibliography. Two years later The Commission on College Physics teamed Shurcliff with Stanley S. Ballard to write a text on polarized light suitable for college study. The bibliography was reduced to a single page and a reviewer noted the \\"straightforward, conversational style\\" and that \\"The treatment is mostly nonmathematical but touches on electromagnetic theory, the Poincar√© sphere, Stokes vectors and Mueller matrices with great clarity.\\"Thornton Page (1965) \\"Review: Polarized Light by Ballard & Shurcliff\\", American Journal of Physics 33(7): 590 The bibliography was later republished in an anthology.W.

He co-founded the Citizens' League Against the Sonic Boom, and was a member of the advisory committee to the Anti- Concorde Project. \\"Shurcliff, as much as anyone in the United States, deserves credit for making it politically impossible to fly SST's over populated areas.\\"Joel Primack and Frank von Hippel (April 1972) Scientists, Politics and the SST: a Critical Review, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, pages 24 to 30 via Google Books =Passive solar building design= In the 1970s and 1980s, he became an advocate for passive solar building design and superinsulation. =Defense= He opposed the Strategic Defense Initiative.

Life Hayakawa (aged 13; front row, far right) during his apprenticeship at the metallic ornament workshop, and his coworkers. () Hayakawa was born in Tokyo in 1893. Due to difficult domestic circumstances, he was adopted by the Ideno family. He left primary school after second grade due to his family‚Äôs poverty and was apprenticed to a maker of metallic ornaments. Hayakawa was inspired to invent a new belt that could be fastened to any length and developed a buckle that used a roller to fasten a belt without puncturing it. Tokuji applied for a patent, using the name ‚ÄúTokubij≈ç.‚Äù When Hayakawa launched his buckle in 1912, demand in Japan for the buckle increased with the spread of Western-style fashions. The first order for the Tokubij≈ç buckle was huge ‚Äî 33 grosses or 4,752 in total. Tokuji decided to produce his buckle independently. He borrowed most of the capital and opened his own manufacturing operation in September 1912. His manufacturing process steadily improved, and the business expanded. In 1913, Hayakawa acquired the patent of an innovative water faucet, and in 1915, he developed the prototype of the Sharp automatic pencil still sold today. Later, he expanded his enterprise into electronics manufacturing of radios, tape- recorders and televisions. He was also active in social welfare programs. He died in 1980 at the age of 86.

The first of the 1,450 EUFOR forces began arriving in July 2006. Resolution =Observations= In the preamble of the resolution, the Council praised the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the holding of a referendum for a draft constitution that entered into force on February 18, 2006. It stated that to achieve lasting peace and stability, the holding of elections was necessary and the rule of law had to be restored. The intention of the European Union to deploy a mission to support MONUC was welcomed by Security Council members. =Acts= Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council authorised the deployment of the European Union mission supporting MONUC for a period of four months after the date of the first presidential and parliamentary elections. It would concentrate in the capital Kinshasa (allowing MONUC to focus on the east of the country) and have elements outside the country and would be subject to a mandate extension beyond September 30, 2006, in conjunction with MONUC. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was to inform the Council on the Congolese authorities timetable for the elections. EUFOR RD Congo was authorised to take the following measures: :(a) assist MONUC in difficult situations to prevent them from escalating; :(b) protect the population under immediate threat of danger; :(c) contribute to the protection of N'djili Airport in Kinshasa; :(d) ensure the safety and freedom of movement of personnel and facilities of EUFOR RD Congo; :(e) conduct limited operations to extract individuals from danger. The arms embargo and other sanctions applied in resolutions 1493 (2003) and 1596 (2005) would not apply to the operation. The Congolese government and European Union were urged to conclude a status of forces agreement. Regional states were also asked to provide support, and MONUC was authorised to provide necessary logistical support. Finally, all Congolese parties were urged to uphold their commitment to a democratic process.

Biography Terpigorev was born on May 24, 1841, in the village of Nikolsky in the Usmansky District of Tambov Governorate (now Dobrinsky District, Lipetsk Oblast) into an impoverished noble family. He attended grammar school, and in 1861-62, studied at Saint Petersburg State University. For his involvement in student unrest he was exiled and sent to the family estate of his mother, where he lived for five years under police surveillance. During this period he decided to gather material for essays on social topics. He sent them to the magazine Russian Word (Russkoye Slovo) and the St. Petersburg newspaper The Voice (Golos). These essays denounced fraud and embezzlement, and showed the hard life of the common people. In 1867, when his term of exile ended, Terpigorev again went to St. Petersburg. He published a series of essays on life in the steppe in the popular magazine Notes of the Fatherland, which he signed with the pseudonym \\"Sergey Atava\\". In these essays he commented on the poor state of affairs after the Emancipation reform of 1861. In January 1880 he published a series of essays about poverty in Notes of the Fatherland. He then published Disturbed Shadows, a collection of essays which brought him literary fame. Subsequent collections included The Yellow Book (Uzorochnaya Pestryad) and Historical Stories and Memories. In his later years he worked on his novel The Ice Broke, but was unable to finish it.

This 17-year species is closely related to two 13-year species (M. tredecim and M. neotredecim); these three species are often described together as \\"decim periodical cicadas.\\" Decim periodical cicadas is a term used to group three closely related species of periodical cicadas: Magicicada septendecim, Magicicada tredecim, and Magicicada neotredecim. M. septendecim, first described by Carl Linnaeus, has a 17-year life cycle; the name septendecim is Latin for 17. M. tredecim, first described in 1868, has a similar call and appearance but a 13-year life cycle; tredecim is Latin for 13. M. neotredecim (Latin for \\"new 13\\"), first described in 2000 by Marshall and Cooley in an article in the journal Evolution, is a 13-year species but otherwise much more similar to M. septendecim than to M. tredecim as shown by studies of DNA and abdominal color variation by Simon and colleagues in a companion article in the same journal issue. Description Like other species included in Magicicada, decim periodical cicadas have synchronized development with a long larval period underground (13 or 17 years, depending on species), followed by mass emergence, quick development to adult flying forms, and massed singing choruses of males that attract many females. Mating, egg-laying, and the death of all adult cicadas occur within weeks. Eggs hatch into first-instar larvae, which tunnel into the earth to begin their own multi-year subterranean feeding period. Head of Magicicada septendecim showing red eyes and three ocelliAll Magicicada species have a black dorsal thorax and orange wing veins. Their large compound eyes, and the three ocelli arranged in a triangle between two eyes, are red. All three decim species show orange coloration on the underside of the abdomen: broad orange stripes in the case of M. septendecim and M. neotredecim, solid orangish or caramel color in the case of M. tredecim. Magicicada males typically form large aggregations that sing in chorus to attract receptive females. The decim periodical cicadas share a distinctive song said to resemble someone calling \\"weeeee-whoa\\" or \\"Pharaoh\\". The Encyclopedia of Entomology describes a decim song pattern as \\"pure tone, musical buzz ending in a drop in pitch\\". The calling song of M. tredecim has a slightly lower pitch than those of M. septendecim and M. neotredecim. M. neotredecim was first identified when scientists noticed a bimodal split in the dominant pitch (frequency) of male calling songs during the 1998 emergence of Brood XIX. The dominant song pitch of M. neotredecim ranges from 1.25 to 1.90 kHz. (This is similar to the pitch-range of M. septendecim, except that songs of the 17-year species do not extend so far into high frequencies.) M. neotredecim song frequencies have been observed to displace upward in areas where their range overlaps with the similar M. tredecim, whose dominant song pitch is lower, ranging between 1.00 and 1.25 kHz. These distinctive calling songs prompted a closer look at older data concerning M. tredecim. Two forms of mitochondrial DNA, correlated with a difference in abdominal color, had already been seen in insects assigned to this species. David Marshall and John Cooley determined that these known differences correlated with the observed pitch difference in males and a corresponding pitch preference in females. The name M. neotredecim was given to the variant whose song, abdominal coloring (orange with a black lateral band or center), and mitochondrial DNA resemble the 17-year species M. septendecim. The earlier name M. tredecim was reserved for the group whose abdomen is mostly orange, whose song has a lower pitch, and whose mitochondrial DNA differs slightly from the two other species of decim cicadas. The mitochondrial DNA difference observed suggests that the M. tredecim lineage separated from the other decim line about one million years ago. Habitat The decim cicadas live in the United States east of the Great Plains. They are typically found in upland woods and forest-prairie ecotones, favoring deciduous trees and shrubs both for chorus locations and for laying their eggs. Nymphs can survive feeding on the roots of many kinds of plants, including conifers and deciduous trees.

Lugano, 1914  The first joint meeting of any of the socialist parties after the out break of the war was held by representatives of the Swiss Social Democratic Party and the Italian Socialist Party at Lugano on September 27, 1914. Attendees included Giacinto Menotti Serrati, Angelica Balabanoff, Oddino Morgari, Costantino Lazzari, Filippo Turati, Elia Musatti, Giuseppe Modigliani, Dominico Armuzzi, Giuseppe de Falco, Celestino Ratti for the Italians and Josef Albisser, Mario Ferri, Hermann Greulich, Paul Pfluger, Anton Rimathe, Hans Schenkel, Robert Grimm and Charles Naine for the Swiss Party.Fainsod, Merle International socialism and the World War New York, Octagon Books 1973 p.46Olga Hess Gankin and H.H. Fisher eds, The Bolsheviks and the First World War: the origins of the Third International Stanford University Press, 1940 The resolution adopted by the conference declared that the war was caused by \\"the imperialist policy of the Great Powers\\", the competition for markets, and the attempt to suppress the proletariat and Social democracy. It claimed that the Central Powers could not claim this as a fight against Czarism to protect high culture, as they suppressed it in their own lands, and that the Entente could not claim to be fighting for self-determination, as the war was not being fought to free the nations from \\"capitalist oppression\\" and their Alliance with Russia only increased oppression and hindered the growth of high culture. The resolution further stated that the capitalists had stirred parts of the working class into a chauvinist frenzy and made portions of it believe it was fighting for a noble cause. The conference called on the parties of the neutral countries to demand that their states stay out of the war, and that the war should be brought to a speedy end by diplomatic negotiations.Walling, William English The socialists and the war; a documentary statement of the position of the socialists of all countries, with special reference to their peace policy; including a summary of the revolutionary state socialist measures adopted by the governments at war New York Holt 1915  Copenhagen, 1915  A joint meeting of the socialist parties of the Scandinavian countries was held on October 11 at Stockholm. Hjalmar Branting, Fredrik Str√∂m and Herman Lindquist represented the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Jacob Vidnes, Magnus Nilssen and Ole Lian represented the Labour Party (Norway) and Frederick Borgbjerg, Thorvald Stauning and Carl Madsen for the Danish Social Democrats. Pieter Jelles Troelstra of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands) also attended. Among the topics discussed was a proposed by the Dutch that the headquarters of the International Socialist Bureau be moved from occupied Brussels to Amsterdam and its affairs be put in charge of the Dutch party. It was decided that a conference of all the parties affiliated to the ISB should be called to decide on the issue. The French rebuffed this offer, and it was soon decided to call a conference just of the parties of neutral countries. Some time between October 11 and November 1914, the headquarters of the ISB were moved to the Hague and three Dutch members were added to the Executive Committee with the consent of its Secretary, Camille Huysmans, and all the other affiliated parties, with the exception of the French.Huysmans, Camille, 1871-1968 The policy of the International; a speech of and an interview with the secretary of the International London, G. Allen & Unwin ltd 1916 pp.18,20 Meanwhile, attempts to line up delegations from other neutral countries were not very successful. The proposed program of the conference, which excluded discussion of the causes of the war and the standpoints of the belligerents alienated the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, who declined to attend. The Swiss party was more intent on a conference along the lines of the Lugano resolution, and by December 19 they had decided not to attend. When Hilquit learned that the scope of the conference had narrowed down to four countries in a \\"localized\\" region of Europe, he felt the US would be out of place there and decided not to attend. The Italian Modigliani did not attend \\"rather from accident than for any other reason\\", according to Angelica Balabanov. When the conference did finally assemble on January 17‚Äì18, 1915, it consisted of sixteen delegates, four from the Netherlands (Troelsta, Hendrik van Kol, Fliechek and Wibaut) and four each from the Scandinavian countries (at least: SwedenBranting; DenmarkStaunding and Borgbjerg; NorwayNilssen and Ole Z.

Greetings or declarations were received by the conference from the French Socialist Party, Social Democratic Party of Germany, Swiss Social Democratic Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the Independent Labour Party, the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks), the Organization Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Menshevik), the Nasha Zarya group (who submitted a report advocating German victory), Camille Huysmans (who claimed he could not attend because the Germans would not grant him a passport), several Swedish trade unions and Bund. The conferences main resolution was drafted by a commission of Stauning, Troelsta, Nilssen and Branting. It blamed capitalism \\"in its imperialist form\\", growth of armaments, secret diplomacy and expansionism as the cause of the war. Recalling the resolution passed at the 1910 Copenhagen Congress, it called on socialist parliamentarians to struggle for the introduction compulsory arbitration courts for international disputes; reduction of armaments, with complete disarmament as the ultimate aim; abolition of secret diplomacy, making foreign affairs a parliamentary responsibility; and recognition of the right of national self-determination. It further suggested that socialist parties should elaborate peace terms that would not be the basis for a future war, called for a full meeting of the International Socialist Bureau \\"as soon as is deemed convenient\\", and a full congress of the international at the time of the peace negotiations. Finally they reminded the workers that the world war was only possible because the capitalists were in control of the governments and \\"consequently, the conference urges the laboring class to make every effort to seize political power in order that imperialism may be crushed and international Social Democracy may accomplish its mission of emancipating the peoples.\\" The conference also passed resolutions urging the parties in neutral countries to persuade their governments to offer their services to mediate an end to the war and protesting the arrest of socialist members of the Fourth Duma.  Hague, 1916  After the Zimmerwald Conference, the International Socialist Bureau arranged to have a meeting of socialist from neutral countries convene under its auspices. Originally scheduled for June 26, 1916, it finally met at the Hague on July 31.

Reesor's grandparents Peter Rieser (1713-1804) and Elizabeth Hershey had moved from Switzerland to Bavaria and then to America in 1739.http://www.reesorfamily.on.ca/  First visit to Canada  At the close of the American Revolution, many pacifist Mennonites left the newly formed United States in loyalty to the British Crown which guaranteed them exemption from military service. In 1798, Peter Reesor was appointed by his family and community to travel to Upper Canada and explore newly opened lands for settlement.See: North Pickering Community Development Project, The Historical Complexities of Pickering, Markham, Scarborough and Uxbridge (Government of Ontario, Sept. 1973), pp. 22-25. He saddled up a horse and packed a few things for his seven-week, 500 mile journey to York (Toronto). Upon arrival Peter was directed to travel up the Rouge River trail to an area which later became known as Cedar Grove. There was ample amount of good timberland. On his short stay here he met a mercenary German army officer, Frederic Baron de Hoen. The officer apparently offered Peter roughly 500 acres of land around a kettle lake in Whitchurch Township (Reesor Lake, later Preston Lake) in exchange for his horse and saddle. Reesor took the offer. However, when the officer wanted the bridle as well, Reesor‚Äîalways a shrewd business man‚Äîstated it was not part of the original deal. According to family tradition, Peter Reesor walked back to Pennsylvania carrying the bridle on his shoulder.  Reesor family emigration  In 1804, Peter Reesor led a larger group of Pennsylvania Dutch Mennonite families on the long journey to Upper Canada for settlement along the Rouge River. Peter had chosen Lot 4, on Concession 9 (five acres of land) on the Little Rouge River for his own homestead. His brother-in-law Abraham Stouffer settled further north and founded the community of Stouffville. The first task of the pioneer families was to clear large numbers of trees in preparation for farming. At the time, pioneers only had axes and hand saws to cut down the three to four foot diameter maple and pine trees. This was very dangerous work. In 1806, shortly after arriving in Canada, Christian Reesor (Peter's father) was killed by a falling tree. After a few years of tree clearing there was enough land to start farming wheat. Initially they would take their wheat and travel miles to a grist mill to be turned into flour. But Peter Reesor, like his brother-in-law Abraham Stouffer, was both a farmer and miller. Soon Reesor had built a saw mill and a grist mill on the Little Rouge River, and by 1850 he and his son Peter Jr. had acquired a third mill as well.For Peter Reesor's contribution to Cedar Grove, see Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793-1900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), 235-237.

A nephew, David Reesor, became well known as a Lieutenant-Colonel of the Reserve Militia in York (against his pacifist Mennonite tradition‚Äîhe became a Methodist) and was appointed to the Senate of Canada.  Founding a town  The settlement between Peter Reesor's farm and mill and his brother's farms became known as Reesorville. In 1825, Reesorville was renamed the Village of Markham to coincide with the Township of Markham.For the early history of Reesorville/Markham, see I.

From 1724 to 1728, she was Regent of this Thuringian state.  Life  Sophia Albertine was the youngest daughter of General Count George Louis I of Erbach-Erbach (1643‚Äì1693) and his wife Countess Amalia Katharina of Waldeck-Eisenberg (1640‚Äì1697). She married on 4 February 1704 in Erbach Duke Ernest Frederick I of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Sophia Albertine was responsible for the education of their children because her husband was largely devoted to the life of a soldier outside the country. After her husband's death in 1724 Sophia Albertine acted as regent for her minor son, Ernest Frederick II of Saxe-Hildburghausen. She managed to reduce the national debt by savings and cuttings. A large part of the court was dismissed and the costly Guard was dissolved. She reduced the number of taxes from 16 to 8. In an attempt to obtain cash, she sold off the valuable ducal library. Her husband had sold the District of Schalkau to the Duchy of Saxe- Meiningen in 1723, in order to raise money. She regarded this sale as illegal. Influenced by Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen, who was in Hildeburghausen at the time, Sophia Albertine declared war on Saxe-Meiningen and had Schalkau occupied militarily on 11 July 1724. After a fire in the town of Hildeburghausen in 1725, she played a major role in support of those affected. The main hall in the Hildburghausen Palace was equipped with an inlaid floor with a design in a star shape, in the center of which were the Duchess's initials \\"SA\\". After her son took over government in 1728, she retired to her Wittum seat of Eisfeld, where she died on 4 September 1742.  Offspring  Sophia Albertine and her husband Ernest Frederick had 14 children, as listed below, but as many as 11 of their children died in infancy, and only three children reached adulthood. Their children were: # Ernest Louis Hollandinus (b. Hildburghausen, 24 November 1704 ‚Äì d. Hildburghausen, 26 November 1704). # Sophie Amalie Elisabeth (b. Hildburghausen, 5 October 1705 ‚Äì d.

The article, by one Maximilian Wechsler, quoted Madhi as saying that he supports Iranians' right to protest peacefully against the government, and that both President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi were \\"crazy.\\"Ex-spy chief says Iran government about to collapse bangkokpost.com 3/01/2010 The article, however, was called into question. Laura Rozen, writing in Politico.com, could find no references to Madhi being a former Iran intelligence chief other than \\"those generated by the article itself;\\" and author Maximilian Wechsler, was \\"a former documented Czech- Australian double agent and informant.\\"Iran. Beware propaganda Laura Rozen 3 January 2010 Another doubter, Golnaz Esfandiari of rferl.org, (writing after the release of the infiltration documentary) stated that RFE/RL's Persian service, Radio Farda, spoke with Madhi in early 2010 \\"but decided not to air any interviews because the editors felt Madhi was not credible and they were not able to verify his many claims.\\" A year later Madhi appeared in a A Diamond for Deception, a documentary by Iranian state television aired just a few days before the second anniversary of 2009 protest over the disputed presidential election of President Ahmadinejad. The documentary describes Madhi as \\"a double agent\\" who infiltrated the Iranian opposition movement and foreign intelligence units, and succeeded in meeting US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, and US vice president Joe Biden, among other western officials. Madhi introduces himself to the opposition as \\"a diamond dealer\\" in the documentary, and approaches foreign governments under the guise of \\"a top official wanting to defect from the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard and claiming thousands of his colleagues were ready to join him.\\" He also spends time in a military base in Israel working with the Israel's secret services.Iran claims agent infiltrated opposition and foreign intelligence units, Saeed Kamali Dehghan, The Guardian, 10 June 2011 According to Madhi, Western countries have spent huge sums of money to keep the Iranian opposition alive, and former Iranian diplomat Mehrdad Khonsari, was involved in the efforts to create an Iranian government in exile. These claims have also come under doubt. The \\"ultra-conservative\\" Iranian newspaper Kayhan published an article entitled \\"Confessions of an arrested member of the anti- revolutionaries,\\" in which Madhi is the arrested member and his remarks are not exposes but confessions. The IRNA state news agency described the documentary prior to its broadcast as the confessions to authorities of a man deceived by the CIA. According to the editor of the opposition Khodnevis website, Nikahang Kowsar, who had been in contact with Madhi: > \\"It is too soon to release the truth about Madhi. He might have acted as a > double agent and it might be similar to the case of Shahram Amiri, the > nuclear scientist who Iran claimed was their man, but some others said he > returned to Iran after the government threatened his family in Iran. According to the Tehran Bureau, documentary notwithstanding, there is no evidence either of a connection between Madhi and the Iranian Green Movement's leaders (Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi), or of any meetings between Madhi and U.S. officials.IRI vs. 'Government in Exile': Foiling a Plot or Trying to Discredit Greens?, by Muhammad Sahimi, PBS, 11 Jun 2011 See also *Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps *The Green Path of Hope Footnotes Category:Living people Category:Iranian spies Category:Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps second brigadier generals Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mohammad Reza Madhi"},{"id":"32087608","text":"The 1972 CFL Draft composed of nine rounds where 70 Canadian football players that were chosen exclusively from eligible Canadian universities.

A variant, the Southside Fizz, adds soda water. History Its origins are subject to speculation. It has been proposed that it gets its name from either the South Side district of the city of Chicago, Illinois, or from the Southside Sportsmen's Club on Long Island. The drink may have been the preferred beverage of Al Capone, whose gang dominated Chicago's South Side. The gin imported by Capone's rivals on the North Side of Chicago was smooth, and usually consumed with ginger ale. However, the gin consumed by Al Capone's gang had a rougher finish, and required more sweeteners to make it palatable. Thus the South Side was born. 21 Club recipe The following recipe for a South Side is used by the famed 21 Club in New York City. Ingredients: * 10-12 mint leaves * 2 ounces gin * 3/4 ounces fresh-squeezed lemon juice * 3/4 ounces simple syrup Combine all ingredients except mint into a cocktail shaker, fill shaker with ice, and shake well. Open the shaker and add the mint, leaving one mint leaf around the size of your thumb for garnish. Close the cocktail shaker and roll the mint leaves from one end of the shaker to the other so as to gently release the mint oils but not to bruise the leaves. Strain the glass into a highball glass and garnish with a mint leaf.

Massachusetts, 427 U.S. 618 (1976), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Massachusetts two-tier court system did not deprive Ludwig of his U.S. Const., Amend. XIV right to a jury trial and did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Const., Amend. V.. Facts of the Case On February 1, 1974, in the District Court of Northern Norfolk, Ludwig was charged with operating a motor vehicle ‚Äúnegligently . . . so that the lives and safety of the public might be endangered.‚Äù At the commencement of trial, Ludwig moved for a ‚Äúspeedy trial by jury,‚Äù citing the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The motion was denied, and, after a brief trial, the court adjudged Ludwig guilty and imposed a fine of $20. Thereafter, Ludwig asserted his statutory right to a trial De novo before a six-man jury in the District Court. In the De novo proceeding, Ludwig filed a ‚Äúmotion to dismiss‚Äù on the grounds that he had been deprived of his federal constitutional right to a speedy jury trial in the first instance, and that he had been subjected to double jeopardy. The motion was denied. At the second trial, Ludwig waived a jury and, after trial by the court, again was adjudged guilty, and again was fined $20. Ludwig appealed to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, which affirmed the decision of the trial court. The Massachusetts Court held that Ludwig was not deprived of his right to a jury trial nor was he twice put in jeopardy. Analysis of the Court Ludwig raised two issues on appeal, both of which the Supreme Court of the United States reasoned separately. =Right to Jury= The Court determined whether Ludwig‚Äôs right to a jury trial was infringed by first viewing the right in light of the common-law protection. The right to a jury trial, at common law, was reserved to serious criminal cases. In determining the scope of that right in state proceedings, the Court stated that the ‚ÄúFourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which were they to be tried in a federal court would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee.‚Äù Therefore, only when an accused is charged with a ‚Äúpetty‚Äù offense, usually defined by reference to the maximum punishment that might be imposed, does the Constitution permit the Federal Government and the State to deprive a defendant of his liberty without affording him an opportunity to have his guilt determined by a jury. The Court had previously held that a jury of 12 is not essential to the right. It additionally held that the jury's verdict need not be unanimous. What is important is that a majority verdict consists of ‚Äúa group of laymen representative of a cross section of the community who have the duty and the opportunity to deliberate, free from outside attempts at intimidation, on the question of a defendant's guilt.‚Äù There is no question that Ludwig‚Äôs right to a jury trial was intact. The Massachusetts courts provide a jury for all serious offenses and provides a jury upon appeal from the lower court‚Äôs decision. =Double Jeopardy= The protection afforded by the principle of double jeopardy as a function of three related common-law pleas: Autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon. Only autrefois convict was at issue in the case. Ludwig was initially convicted. He argued that he could not be retried when he informed the trial court of his decision to ‚Äúappeal‚Äù and to secure a trial De novo. The decision to secure a new trial rests with the accused alone. A defendant who elects to be tried De novo in Massachusetts is in no different position than is a convicted defendant who successfully appeals on the basis of the trial record and gains a reversal of his conviction and a remand of his case for a new trial. The only difference between an appeal on the record and an appeal resulting automatically in a new trial is that a convicted defendant in Massachusetts may obtain a ‚Äúreversal‚Äù and a new trial without assignment of error in the proceedings at his first trial. Nothing in the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a State from affording a defendant two opportunities to avoid conviction and secure an acquittal.

Banu Tai The Banu Tai were a tribe divided between the profession of idolatry and Christianity. The chief of the tribe was Hatim Tai, he came to prominence because of his generosity and he acquired fame as a great hero of Arabia at the time, according to the Encyclopedia of Islam. Hatim was succeeded by Adi, who tried to follow in the footsteps of his father. Adi was very religious. Expedition Muhammad sent Ali ibn Abi Talib with 150 men to destroy the statue (idol) of the pagan deity al-Fuls (al-Qullus), worshipped by the people of Banu Tai. 100 of the Muslim fighters were on camel and the rest were on horseback. Ali took with him a black flag, and a white banner. Adi bin Hatim (the chief of the tribe) escaped to Syria. At dawn, Ali carried out a raid on the inhabitants and demolished the statue of al-Fuls (al-Qullus), and captured many camels and sheep as war booty. The Muslims also took a number of men, women and children as captives. One of the captives was Hatim Tai's (the former chief of the tribes) daughter. Adi bin Hatim (the chief of the tribe) escaped to Syria. Inside the al-Qullus safe the Muslims found three swords and three pieces of armour. They then shared the spoils and left the best for Muhammad. Aftermath Upon arrival in Madinah, the sister of ‚ÄòAdi bin Hatim begged Muhammad for mercy on her and said: > O Messenger of All√¢h, my brother is absent and father is dead, and I am too > old to render any service. Be beneficent to me so that All√¢h may be > bountiful to you.He said: \\"Who is your brother?\\" She said: \\"It is ‚ÄòAdi bin > Hatim.\\", and Muhammad replied: \\"Is he not the one who fled from All√¢h and > his Messenger? Muhammad then went away from her. The next day she reiterated the same thing and received the same answer. A day later she said the same thing a third time, but this time she was given a horse to go looking for her brother. Her brother came to Muhammad and a conversation took place. The Muslim scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya mentions the conversation and event in his book Zad al- Ma'ad as follows: > What makes you flee? Do you flee lest you should say there is no god but > All√¢h? Do you know any other god but All√¢h?\\" \\"No\\" he said, then talked for a > while. The Messenger of All√¢h went on saying: \\"Certainly you flee so that > you may not hear the statement saying ‚ÄòAll√¢h is the Greatest.‚Äô Do you know > anyone who is greater than All√¢h?\\" \\"No\\" he said. \\"The Jews are those whose > portion is wrath, and the Christians are those who have gone astray,\\" the > Prophet retorted. \\"I am a Muslim and I believe in one God (All√¢h).\\" ‚ÄòAdi > finally proclaimed with a joyous face. The Prophet ordered him a residence > with one of the Helpers. From that time he started calling at the Prophet in > the mornings and in the evenings. Adi then embraced Islam as was reappointed the chief of his tribe. The entire tribe then converted to Islam. Islamic primary sources The event is also mentioned by the Muslim Scholar Ibn Sa'd in his book \\"Kitab al-tabaqat al- kabir\\", as follows: Ibn Sa'd also explains the aftermath of this event, and Adi ibn Hatim's conversion to Islam, he wrote: The Muslim scholar, Saifur Rahman al Mubarakpuri, referenced a Hadith from Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal (a Hadith collection) in his biography of Muhammad the \\"Sealed Nectar\\".
