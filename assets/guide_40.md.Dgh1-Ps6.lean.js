Chemical structure  Urea nitrogen is the end product of breakdown of proteins in the body. In individuals with normal kidney and liver functions, urea is excreted via urine.  Indication for testing  By testing for UUN, clinicians can assess one's nitrogen balance. Calculating nitrogen balance is a useful tool in assessing adequacy of protein provision in clinical setting in: * Patients with questionable protein intake. * Patients with confirmed or suspected protein digestion and absorption problems. * Patients with increased metabolic demand due to catabolic disease status. * Patients on long-term enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition.  Calculation of nitrogen balance  UUN is determined from 24-hour urine collection. Along with UUN, values for BUN, protein content of diet, enteral or parenteral nutrition, and notable outputs other than urine (gastric residual, fistula output, drainages) are needed to calculate nitrogen balance. Nitrogen Balance = Protein intake/6.25- UN + 4 * For average loss via sweat.  Interpretations  * Nitrogen balance value of 0 indicates maintenance. * If nitrogen balance is negative, nutrition intervention should address increased protein provision until equilibrium achieved. When test is not appropriate  As UUN test is based on 24-hour urine, in individuals with kidney disease with less than 1000 ml urine out/day or on dialysis, this test cannot be applied.

The group received popular recognition with the publication of its pioneering report \\"Less than Gay\\" in 1991. Through this report, ABVA advocated for civil rights of LGBTQ people to include same sex marriage, LGBT parenting, and the decriminalization of homosexuality through the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. In 1994, ABVA filed the first petition challenging the constitutionality of Section 377 in the Delhi High Court, in order to challenge prison authorities' ban on condom distribution. Brief Background ABVA got involved in AIDS activism in 1989 on hearing from women in the red- light area that doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had forcibly tested them for HIV, with the help of the police. ABVA protested this action, asking that good quality condoms, humane treatment and rehabilitation schemes for HIV positive people be made a prerequisite for any government screening for HIV. In addition, it began running a free dispensary for sex workers in Delhi's GB Road District.http://www.sacw.net/aii/abva.html Between February 1990 and August 1991, the ABVA organised several demonstrations in New Delhi to protest against the prevailing discriminatory attitude of authorities against HIV/AIDS victims. The 1994 ABVA petition was filed in the Delhi high court in response to the then IG (Prisons) Kiran Bedi blocking access to condoms at Tihar Jail, India's largest prison. Reacting to claims that two-thirds of all inmates at Tihar had engaged in homosexual behaviour, Bedi said consensual homosexual behaviour was virtually unknown at Tihar and that usage of condoms would promote homosexuality. Less Than Gay In late 1991, ABVA came out with a report titled \\"Less Than Gay: A Citizens' Report on the Status of Homosexuality in India\\" which was the first document to publicly demand queer rights in India. The report is an interesting breakthrough and should be regarded with respect as it provided the first resource on homosexuality in India. Activities ABVA's activities included: * Public advocacy; one success included stalling the AIDS Prevention Bill in 1989 through numerous petitions to Indian parliament. * Organizing public meetings, protest actions and public demonstrations as part of AIDS activism in India. * Networking with AIDS activists and activist organizations in India and abroad. * Grass-root work in Delhi slums and with gay people, with other NGO's involvement. * Research and publication of citizen reports. * Campaigning for the decriminalization of sodomy in India through efforts to repeal all discriminatory legislation.

Completion and analysis Hans Baluschek (1870‚Äì1935), the son of a railway engineer who had been active in the arts since, completed City of Workers in 1920, two years after Germany's defeat in World War I. A member of the Berlin Secession, Baluschek used an emotional technique similar to the German Expressionists in his work, but remained influenced by Realist subject matter. The city-scape, with its contradictory beauty and despair, was a common subject of his. Catherine Sawinski, assistant curator of European art at the Milwaukee Art Museum, describes City of Workers as \\"a powerful critique of what political and social issues can do to ordinary citizens\\", one which depicts Berlin as \\"a menacing and dehumanizing force\\". Baluschek was a proponent for workers rights and a member of the Social Democratic Party. Provenance City of Workers was once owned by Prince Wilhelm Victor of Prussia. Later owners included Schim van der Loeff of Rotterdam and, in 1939, P. Adolf of The Hague. In 2006 the painting ‚Äì expected to bring 15,000 to 20,000 euros ‚Äì was sold at Sotheby's Amsterdam for 114,000 euros (US$151,506) to an American private collector. This was a record for a Baluschek work. The painting was purchased by the Milwaukee Art Museum in October 2010 with funds from Avis Martin Heller. The painting, with the ascension number M2010.49, was displayed in the museum's Gallery 12 in September 2011, together with other works of German Expressionism, but in 2014 it was no longer on display.

The coming out process for any individual is never easy. After all, it is family and society one has to come out to,‚Äù says MJ. The idea behind Gaysi Family was to provide a platform for queers.

Along with his friend S.A. David, He founded Gandhiyam, a social service organization, named after the Indian revolutionary Mahatma Gandhi, that was aimed at economic, social, cultural revival of the Tamils and also fight the Sri Lankan state's repeated and continued policies of oppressing the Tamils and denying them of their rights. The Sri Lankan government unlawfully arrested along with him, several thousands Tamil activists and he was sentenced to the Welikada Prison where he was subsequently killed during the anti-Tamil pogrom of 1983. Social Work Rajasundaram along with his friend and noted architect S.A. David, founded Gandhiyam to peacefully resist the Sri Lankan state terror through Gandhian principles and also lead the Tamil people to live as per the Gandhian ways of life. In a span of 5 years, the organization had a sound presence throughout the traditional homelands of the Tamils in Sri Lanka, in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa.http://30yearsago.asia/jenny-jeyachandran/ At the time of their arrest, the organization had 450 pre schools with an average of thirty students each were providing daily milk and triposha and Kindergarten teaching facilities to village children.

Dr. Rajasunderam was severely attacked, his left arm dislocated, his ear drums broken and left on several occasions unconscious on the floor. On 25 July 1983, several Tamil inmates of the Welikada Prison, almost all of them exclusively detained under the PTA were attacked by Sinhala prisoners and guards as a part of the larger pogrom against Tamils. 35 including one 16-year-old were brutally murdered and dumped in front of a statue of the Buddha in the prison yard. The remaining Tamil prisoners those who managed to survive the massacre were detained at the youth ward and the first floor of the prison. Two days later, on 27 July, armed Sinhalese prisoners broke into both these cells where Rajasundaram and David among others were housed. Nearly 40 prisoners armed with axes, swords, crowbars, iron pipes and wooden logs appeared before the cell and started to break the lock.

Jurisdiction The Court hears appeals from people who were convicted or pleaded guilty and were sentenced by a Supreme or District court judge. The Court also hears appeals lodged by The Crown against the severity of a sentence. Decisions made by the Land and Environment Court, the Industrial Court or the Drug Court in criminal jurisdiction may also be brought for appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal may also grant leave to appeal in matters involving questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law. It may also grant leave to appeal in cases where the severity or adequacy of the sentence is challenged. If a petitioner is not satisfied with the decision made by the Court of Criminal Appeal, application may be made to the High Court of Australia for special leave to appeal the decision before the High Court. Composition Three judges usually form the panel for appeals, although five judges can be used for significant legal issues. The Chief Justice has ultimate discretion in determining the number of judges to sit on the Bench, and the selection of individual judges for each case. A unanimous decision is not needed as the majority view will prevail. The presiding judge is usually one of the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, a Judges of Appeal or the Chief Judge at Common Law. Typically each bench comprises at least two judges of the Common Law Division. Single judges hear sentence appeals from the Drug Court. The Judges who may typically be the presiding judge are listed below: Caseload In 2018, the Court heard 407 new cases, which included 265 appeals against severity of sentence, 108 appeals against conviction, 19 appeals against interlocutory judgments and 1 case returned from the High Court for re-hearing. Appeals against convictions were approximately 27 per cent in 2018 and, in recent years have showed a trend towards increasing complexity, impacting on Court time and resources.

This is the first album in 17 years, and Area had been in hiatus from 1983 to 1993. They first reunited as a trio consisting of Fariselli, Capiozzo and Tavolazzi. Tavolazzi, after the first shows, left the band in order to pursue other projects. Much like the previous studio album \\"Tic&Tac;\\" from 17 years earlier, this album is much more of a jazz/fusion product than Area's classic sound. This is the only album with bass player Paolo dalla Porta, who replaced Tavolazzi. The album is completely instrumental, apart for some vocalizations on \\"Fall Down\\". \\"Sedimentazioni\\" consists of approximately five minutes of silence and one minute and half containing excerpts from every track Area recorded in their career overlying in top of the other. \\"Efstratios\\" is dedicated to past member and singer Demetrio Stratos who died in 1979, whose real name was, in fact, Efstratios. This is, to date, the latest studio album (but not the latest non-phostumous) to be released by Area. In 2000 Capiozzo died of a heart attack and the band disbanded seemingly for good. In 2009, a line-up of Fariselli, Tavolazzi and the band's classic guitar player Tofani reunited and, as of 2014, is still active.

In 1761, the most extensive of these early private collections, owned by Joachim von Dessin, the secretary of the Orphan Chamber, was left to the Cape consistory of the Dutch Reformed Church specifically to form the basis of a public library for the advantage of the community. The National Library of South Africa was the first library to be established in South Africa by proclamation on 20 March 1818 by Lord Charles Somerset when he stipulated that a wine tax would be levied to pay for it. The issuing of the \\"Molteno Regulations\\", in the Cape Colony in 1874, was a turning point in the development of public libraries in southern Africa. Their provision of a pound-for-pound government grant for the establishment and maintenance of libraries - even in rural areas - led to the Cape Colony having one of the greatest concentrations of libraries anywhere in the world. Due to their simplicity and success, the regulations were adopted elsewhere in southern Africa, especially after union in 1910, and remained in force until 1955.R.J.Holloway: The History and Development of the Kimberley Africana Library and its Relationship with the Kimberley Public Library.

The case arose under Connecticut law, but the opinion extensively discussed by analogy the relevant standards under Delaware and New York law. Facts Doris Joy was a minority shareholder in Citytrust, Inc and Nelson North was the CEO. Doris complained that Nelson had given a loan to Katz Corp, without considering the merits of the deal, because Katz Corp employed Nelson's son. Citytrust, Inc established a 'Special Litigation Committee' of two independent directors, which concluded that the litigation should be discontinued in respect of most of the board members. Judgment Judge Winter held that the litigation was warranted. If the case appears to be worth a substantial amount in relation to equity, the case should continue. If not it must consider further business factors. Judge Cardamone, dissenting, disapproved of the method.

The airplane was piloted by former Oklahoma State Senator Olin Branstetter. The subsequent investigation concluded that the pilot lost control of the aircraft, but the cause of the loss of control was undetermined. It was the second plane crash in ten years to involve an Oklahoma State University (OSU) basketball team, after the 2001 accident in which two players, 6 staff and both pilots lost their lives.  Background  Olin Branstetter, an 82-year old former OSU graduate and contributor to the university, was a certified commercial pilot with over 2,200 flight hours logged, and was the owner of N7746W, a single-engine, four-seat Piper PA-28-180 Cherokee built in 1964. The aircraft had accumulated 5,800 hours of flight, and its last annual inspection was completed a week before the accident. On November 17, 2011, Branstetter was flying head coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna on a 'donor flight' from Stillwater, Oklahoma, to North Little Rock, Arkansas, to scout two prospective high school recruits. On board was also Branstetter's wife, Paula, 79, a certified private pilot. On the accident flight, she was seated in the rear with Serna, while Budke sat on the front next to the pilot.  History of the flight  The PA-28 arrived at Stillwater Regional Airport at around 13:45. After picking up Budke and Serna, it took off half an hour later for North Little Rock. The weather was good, and no meteorological hazards were forecasted along the planned route. About two hours after departure, radar data showed the airplane flying level at 7,000 feet over the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, on a south-easterly heading. At 16:10, the airplane entered a right turn and started descending, disappearing from radar shortly after. There were no communications between the airplane and air traffic control. Hunters on the ground near the accident site reported seeing the airplane flying at a low altitude while making turns, before nosediving into a heavily wooded area. They then alerted emergency services. The wreckage of N7746W was found mostly contained in an impact crater about 10 feet in diameter and 3.5 feet deep. Ground scars and witness marks on nearby trees indicated that the airplane had hit the ground with a 50¬∞ to 60¬∞ nose-down attitude.  Investigation  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the crash and released its report in February 2013. It concluded that Branstetter had lost control of the aircraft, although the reason for the loss of control could not be determined. The investigators did not find any pre-impact anomalies with the engine or airframe that would have precluded normal operation of the aircraft. No flight recorders were installed on board, as they were not required. Weather was also ruled out as a factor. The condition of the pilot's remains did not allow for identification of any medical conditions that may have contributed to the crash. It was not possible to perform forensic toxicology tests to detect carbon monoxide nor cyanide poisoning. However, tests for ethanol and drugs returned negative.  Aftermath  Oklahoma State University students, players and staff wore ribbons with the number 4 and the victims' initials in remembrance. A memorial was set up inside the Gallagher- Iba Arena, OSU's basketball venue, bearing semblance to those ribbons. Assistant coach Jim Littell was named Cowgirls' interim head coach and the team's following two games were canceled. After the 2001 accident, the university had introduced rules to prevent players from traveling on single- engine planes. Following Budke's death, OSU expanded the rule to include coaches and staff, also mandating that pilots and aircraft be reviewed by an aviation consultant. The family of Budke received workers' compensation from the university, while the families of both coaches reached a settlement with the estate of the pilot and his wife in July 2014.

As the first neurosurgeon in India, he is widely regarded as the father of modern neurosurgery in India. In 1964, the Government of India honoured him with their third highest civilian award, Padmabhushan, for his services in the fields of neurosurgery and medical education. Biography 235px Jacob Chandy was born on 23 January 1910, in Kottayam, in the south Indian state of Kerala to an Anglican Syrian Christian family. After his early education in Kottayam, he secured his graduate degree, an MBBS in medicine, from Madras Medical College in 1936. He kickstarted his career in 1939 by joining the Mission Hospital in Bahrain, a missionary hospital run by the American Reformed Church, where he stayed until 1944, when he took a hiatus from his practice to complete his MD at the University of Pennsylvania; while there he learned surgery under the guidance of Jonathan Rhoads. In 1945, he received a fellowship from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and continued to practice surgery till 1948. After obtaining a fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons, Canada (FRCS), also in 1948, Chandy moved to Chicago to take up duties as the chief resident at the University of Chicago. It was during this time that Chandy was invited by Robert Greenhill Cochrane, medical missionary and Leprologist, to join the Christian Medical College, Vellore (CMC), a fledgling medical college at that time. Chandy started the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at CMC, the first of its kind in the country, in 1949. Eight years later, in 1958, CMC started the first training program in India for neurosurgery, followed by a program in neurology in 1962, under Chandy's guidance. Over the years, Chandy helped develop the neurology program into one of the most sought after courses in India. During his association with CMC, Chandy held various posts such as the professor of neurology and neurosurgery and the medical superintendent; he was the principal when he retired in 1970. Chandy died on 23 June 2007, leaving behind his wife, Accamma, a daughter, also named Accamma, and two sons, Mathew and Varghese, the former a neurosurgeon and MNI fellow, and the latter, a chemical engineer. Legacy Chandy's legacy lives through the numerous practitioners of neurosurgery who have contributed their services to the development of neurosurgery in India. He assisted many medical practitioners to get advanced training at the Montreal Neurological Institute, such as J. C. Jacob and G. M. Taori in neurology, Sushil Chandi in neuropathology, and Elizabeth Mammen and S. Sarojini in neurosurgical nursing. He was instrumental in promoting the biochemist, Bimal Kumar Bachhawat, who founded the neurochemistry laboratory, which identified the enzymopathy of metachromatic leucodystrophy, in collaboration with James H. Austin. Chandy was the first of the first generation of neurologists, neurosurgeons and neuroscientists. He founded the Neurological Society of India in 1951, along with B. Ramamurthi, Baldev Singh and S. T. Narasimhan. He was the first surgeon in India to perform an epilepsy surgery on 25 August 1952, on a patient suffering from right infantile hemiplegia and medially refractory seizures. Awards and recognitions Chandy was honoured by several institutions, organisations, and governmental bodies during his career. * Professor emeritus of the Government of Kerala ‚Äì 1970 * Padmabhushan ‚Äì 1964 * Medal of Honour by the World Congress of Neurological Surgeons ‚Äì 1989 * Founder and president of the Neurological Society of India * Member ‚Äì Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Health, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences * Member ‚Äì Medical Education Committee of the Indian Council of Medical Research * Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Fellow * He was also the founding member of many neurology related societies in India.

It occurs alongside the more common Œ±3Œ≤4 nicotinic receptor in autonomic ganglia, and as an facilitatory presynaptic autoreceptor at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). At the NMJ, it is involved in upregulation of ACh release during high- frequency stimulation. Nicotine, a component of tobacco, a common stimulate of the receptor has been found to increase the concentration of this receptor. Blockage of this receptor in the presence of a partial postsynaptic neuromuscular block is thought to produce the characteristic tetanic fade caused by non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers. The receptor is classified as an allosteric enzyme that is generally activated by the natural agonist acetylcholine, however it may also be activated by external agonists such as nicotine and blocked by toxins such as bungarus toxin 3.1. The main role of the receptor is to allow the re uptake of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Because it is a receptor involved in mechanisms including the neurotransmitter acetylcholine it is synthesized in the brain. However, Œ±3Œ≤2 receptors synthesized in different locations of the brain may have differing regulatory properties. this is due to the cytoplasmic region in which the receptor is being formulated. Even though, there have been theories, how the increase in the receptors and uptaking of acteylcholine because of smoking nicotine can cause schizophrenia, no real correlation has been deducted.

Cellular Information Systems Inc., 637 A.2d 148 (Del. 1996), is a US corporate law case, concerning the standard in Delaware corporations regarding conflicts of interest. It exemplifies that the Delaware courts spend considerable resources inquiring into whether a director has had an actual conflict of interest, as opposed to the traditional common law approach which demanded that there should be no possibility of a conflict.cf Keech v Sandford [1726] EWHC Ch J76 Facts Broz was sole shareholder and president of RFB Cellular Inc. (RFB), which held telecommunications licenses for a number of districts in Michigan. Broz was also a non-executive board member of CIS, which operated in the same business in the upper Midwestern United States; notably it too operated in parts of Michigan. Broz, as owner of RFB, was approached by Mackinac, a tele-license broker, who offered him another opportunity for a license in Michigan. Broz discussed the matter informally with the CIS board, but did not tell them that he had started negotiating for the license; Broz believed that CIS would not be interested in the opportunity, because at the time it was shedding licenses to try and stave off bankruptcy. Broz was successful in obtaining the license for RFB. Shortly thereafter, CIS avoided bankruptcy and closure by being acquired by Pri- Cellular, after which CIS sued Broz for breaching his fiduciary duty of loyalty, diverting the opportunity to himself. Both Pri-Cellular and RFB were later absorbed by Dobson Cellular in 1998 and 2004, respectively; Dobson was itself bought out by AT&T; in 2007.) Judgment The Delaware Supreme Court held that Broz was not under any obligation to offer the Michigan-2 licence to the CIS board, the opportunity being one that had come to him personally. The plaintiff company had lacked both the interest and the financial means to acquire the licence for itself.

She took her stage name when competing in 2013 on the fifth season of The Voice (United States edition). She subsequently built an international fan base through her YouTube channel and original music releases.  Life and career  Henry is the daughter of Marc Heinrich, a musician and worship director, and Becky Heinrich, an art teacher and graphic artist. She attended public schools in the Minneapolis area and graduated from Hopkins High School. While in high school, Henry sang in a sandwich shop gig and posted covers of songs on her YouTube channel, which she began in 2011. Her most popular video is an a cappella cover of Eurythmics' \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" with three- part vocal harmonies. While taking a gap year before college, Henry's parents encouraged her to audition for The Voice at a Chicago, Illinois audition in January 2013. Henry advanced through the open call and subsequent executive auditions and participated in a boot camp during the summer of 2013. Her Blind Audition performance of The Scientist got all four chairs to turn. The studio performance release by the show charted on Billboard and the live performance video was in the all-time Top 40 for views of The Voice performances on YouTube, until its removal by NBC. In the Battle Rounds, she competed against Cilla Chan, singing Torn. Henry and Chan were montaged (their vocal performances were not shown in full) and Henry was chosen to move on. In the Knockout Round, Henry competed against Nic Hawk, singing Creep by Radiohead. She was sent home, and NBC's The Voice (US) subsequently lost 15% (1.5 million) viewers after that episode. Two years after her appearance on The Voice, Henry's popularity on YouTube had increased 10-fold. Henry released her first EP called The Immigrant in 2013.http://idolforums.com/index.php?s=&showtopic;=706360&view;=findpost&p;=26061147 The 5 track EP peaked on iTunes at #6 on both the US Pop and Rock Charts, the same position it attained in pre-release. On April 7, 2014, Henry took second place (to Shawn Mendes) in the RyanSeacrest.com top cover competition for her rendition of the hit song Say Something. Third place finisher Jamison Murphy later featured Henry on his single \\"Remember When\\". On May 6, 2014, the Grow Music Project released Session Diaries #4, a video on the Christopher Tyng-led production of Henry's single \\"Hide and Seek\\", which was released simultaneously on iTunes. \\"Hide and Seek\\" is the soundtrack for the closing credits of the short film Escapement, written and produced by Erik A. Candiani.http://vimeo.com/98597761 Henry collaborated with Candiani on the KARE11 (Minneapolis TV station) promo for the Sochi Winter Olympics, which was subsequently nominated for two Upper Midwestern Emmy awards, with a win for best Musical Arrangement/Composition. Henry's original song In the Air was commissioned for the 2016 film Intersection: the Story of Josh Grant. Henry's live performances began immediately after her Blind Audition on The Voice. They have included a Minnesota Music Coalition benefit at the Varsity Theater on February 20, 2014, and the Winter's Over Music Festival on April 25, 2015. YouTube produced a video of her single Katie at their YouTube Space in New York, which Henry released on January 19, 2015. Her Indiegogo-funded second EP, The Orchard, was released on August 21, 2015. Henry collaborated with Moonhead Industries to release a music video for Better, a single from the EP. An 11-track album titled King Paten was released on July 1, 2016. It had worldwide sales, charting on iTunes in Russia, South Africa, the UK, Cyprus, Israel, France, Canada and the US. On Sept. 2, 2016, she confirmed to writing a new album. On November 17, 2018, Holly released a song called \\"Float\\" under the name \\"Mooney\\". Again billed as Mooney, she released her self-produced album \\"softer\\" on October 25, 2019.  Reviews  Jonathan Frahm reviewed The Immigrant EP and wrote that Henry \\"displays the beyond-her-years nuance and musicality...delivering what is surely one of the most magnificent releases by a Voice contestant yet.\\" Frahm followed up with a review of \\"Hide and Seek\\" in which he wrote about Henry's songwriting: \\"She‚Äôs writing for all to hear, sure, but each song that Holly writes is its own little world in which she is the only initial representative of its populous. It shows, too, in ‚ÄúHide and Seek‚Äù, as she thoughtfully, mournfully weaves a new tale with regards to a wispy nostalgic quality which she so greatly inhabits. ‚ÄúHide and Seek‚Äù may be one of her more instantly relatable works, as well, given how listeners could easily relate the song‚Äôs lyricism to a past hefty romantic issue of their own.\\" FDRMX writer John Mychal Feraren reviewed Henry's single \\"Grow\\". He said that \\"the real standout in the song is the impeccable songwriting skills of Holly. She was able to establish such lyrical depth in 'Grow' that fully matches her naturally silky tone.\\" Music Historian blogger Patricia Trutescu interviewed Henry and wrote after the release of \\"Hide and Seek\\": \\"the most intriguing quality about this developing artist is that while she returns with a voice we are all familiar with, we now have the opportunity to enjoy something more refreshing ‚Äì beautiful and youthful voice that expresses an old soul.\\" Music Historian guest blogger Gary Reese wrote after the release of \\"The Orchard EP that it \\"successfully plays to audiences attracted to Holly‚Äôs angelic voice and allegorical lyrics. The EP represents a sophisticated evolution of Holly‚Äôs musical talent, combined with a remarkable collaborative achievement by producer and backup instrumentalist Matt Patrick.\\" Reese reviewed King Paten in For Folk's Sake and wrote: \\"The eleven tracks of ‚ÄòKing Paten‚Äô spotlight Holly‚Äôs rapidly maturing vocal talent, with stylistic influences clearly gained in covering over 100 unique artists on her internationally popular YouTube and SoundCloud channels. Lyrically, she coaxes us to hear how she felt in her youth, thus introducing fans to her pre-‚ÄòThe Voice‚Äô youthful innocence. It‚Äôs a musical journey well worth exploring.\\" Ear To The Ground music reviewer Kori Rae Shearer wrote about The Orchard EP that Henry \\"has the type of tone and control that can gently interrupt conversation as heads turn her way. The understated use of her voice and subtle backing vocals are extremely effective. Holly is very skilled in the art of accentuating her message with her vocals, which speaks volumes of the control and talent she brings to the table.\\"  Discography  = Album = { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"width: 14em;\\"  Title ! style=\\"width: 18em;\\"  Details ! style=\\"width: 14em;\\"  Track list - ! scope=\\"row\\" King Paten  *Released: July 1, 2016 *Label: Garden Ghost  - ! scope=\\"row\\" softer (as Mooney)  *Released: October 25, 2019 *Label: Garden Ghost  } =Extended Plays= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"width: 14em;\\"  Title ! style=\\"width: 18em;\\"  Details ! style=\\"width: 14em;\\"  Track list - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Immigrant  *Released: December 16, 2013 *Label: Garden Ghost  - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Orchard  *Released: August 21, 2015 *Label: Garden Ghost  } = Singles = *\\"Katie\\" (September 22, 2013) *\\"Secrets Spoken\\" (September 22, 2013) *\\"More Than Nothing\\" (September 22, 2013) *\\"Paper Love\\" (October 11, 2013) *\\"Hide and Seek\\" (May 5, 2014) *\\"Grow\\" (October 15, 2014) *\\"Float\\" (November 17, 2018) ... as Mooney = Releases from The Voice = *\\"The Scientist\\" *\\"Torn\\"  References   External links  * Holly Henry Official Website * Holly Henry's YouTube Channel Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:The Voice (franchise) contestants Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st- century American women singers Category:Hopkins High School alumni ","title":"Holly Henry"},{"id":"43340874","text":"Live 2012 is the ninth album of the Jazz fusion band Area. It was recorded in 2011 and 2012 during their reunion tour, which marked the return of Paolo Tofani and Ares Tavolazzi who had left the band in 1977 and 1993, respectively. Classic drummer Giulio Capiozzo died in 2000 of a heart attack, his replacement is drummer Walter Paoli. The album is divided in two parts. The first CD includes old songs by the band, in new arranged versions. Most of them are instrumentals (due to the absence of Demetrio Stratos, who died in 1979), except for \\"La Mela di Odessa\\", narrated by Tofani, and \\"Cometa Rossa\\", sung by special guest singer Maria Pia de Vito. This CD also includes a \\"live\\" performance of \\"Sedimentazioni\\", a track released in \\"Chernobyl 7991\\", which contains every track Area has ever recorded, overlying in top of each other.

It held that directors may make charitable donations, so long as their personal interests do not conflict, or there is a contravention of state law. Facts The directors of AP Smith Manufacturing, a New Jersey company making fire hydrants in East Orange, approved donation of $1,500 to Princeton University. The shareholders disapproved of the gift and contended that it was a breach of a director's duty to act in the corporation or shareholder interests. Specifically they argued that there was no express authority in the corporation's certificate of incorporation. A New Jersey statute allowed corporations to make charitable donations, so long as the recipient did not own more than 10 per cent of a corporation's stock, but the shareholders argued this was inapplicable if the corporation was incorporated beforehand.

Cato Blue is an informal term describing a New Zealand railway locomotive livery (resulting from the combination of blue, grey and yellow in the colour scheme) found in common usage amongst the railfan community. The livery was first worn on DFT 7160 as a variation of the New Zealand Rail blue livery. With the introduced of Tranz Rail on 18 October 1995, the livery was adopted to replace New Zealand Rails blue livery, which was introduced in 1991. The scheme was known as Cato Blue after its creator, Cato Partners. DFT 7199 was the first locomotive repainted in the livery after Tranz Rail took over the rail system. EM 1367/ET 3367 leading another Ganz-Mavag EMU set while passing through Epuni. It wasn't just locomotives that were repainted in the livery. All of the 44 Ganz-Mavag built EM/ET electric multiple units, along with one of the English Electric built DM/D EMU units were also repainted in the Cato Blue livery, with the Tranz Metro logo on the side of each car. Tranz Scenics 56-foot, 60-foot and 64-foot carriages and AG vans were also repainted in the livery, with the Tranz Scenic logo on each of side of the carriages. Several 56-foot carriages, that were used on the Wairarapa Connection until 2007, had the Tranz Metro logo on them. It was then replaced in May 2001 when Tranz Rail introduced the Bumble-Bee livery to promote level crossing safety. As of , one DCP, ten DSCs, one EF and two TRs still operate in this livery. AG 153 can be seen being used on the Capital Connection when AG 130 is out of service. Although the two ADs, and five AGs are in storage in Otahuhu and Waltham, they are still operational and can be seen being used on special occasions. Variations Since the introduction of the livery in October 1995, there have been a couple of variations on several locomotives: *Several locomotives that were repainted in the New Zealand Rail livery, had the Tranz Rail logo painted over the New Zealand Rail logo, along with a blue oblong patch. Some locos received the livery with blue cab stripes. *A small group of locos had truncated stripes long enough to cover over the non-reflective numbers *DFT 7145 had blue cab stripes, but without the numbers applied for a short period of time. *DXs 5431 and 5517 had been repainted into the livery, but yellow cabs instead of grey. Both locos were repainted in the original version before being repainted in this variation, and later they had black chutes fitted on the right side of the long-hood. *TR 943 was repainted in the livery with blue all over the sides of the long and short hoods and cab, grey on top of the hoods and cab, yellow head-stocks and the Tranz Rail logo painted on the cab. The loco was original repainted in this livery by Hillside Workshops with \\"Transtec Engineering Dunedin\\" painted on the sides of the long-hood, but this was later removed. *Although not an official variation, DCP 4755 received KiwiRail stickers on the front of the short-hood, and back of the long-hood. DC 4513 and DCP 4628 (with the Tranz Scenic logo in place of the Tranz Rail logo) with the TranzAlpine, while skirting the Waimakariri River. With the rights to Cato Blue sold to Tranz Scenic in 2001, DCP 4761 received a repaint in the livery, but with the Tranz Scenic logo in place of the Tranz Rail logo. DCPs 4559 and 4628 had the Tranz Scenic logo painted on over the Tranz Rail logo. DSC 2624 was repainted by Tranz Scenic with the cab being repainted yellow, instead of grey.

History =Street Performance World Championship= The City Spectacular opened in 2006 and takes place over three days in mid-June. Organized by Mark Duckenfield and Conor McCarthy, who started Emergent Events to organize this festival. Starting with an initial crowd of over 26,000 in 2006, and 40,000 in 2007, the growing crowds can consider this a runaway success. In 2011 the event went through some unexpected changes when its main sponsor terminated their contract leaving the festival organisers with nowhere near the funding needed to run the event. To raise the money needed the organisers decided on a World Record Attempt and set off to gather the world's largest collection of real life Where's Wallys (AKA Where's Waldo). The money needed for the event would be raised through costume sales from stalls all over the park with a large percentage of the money raised going to Africa Aware. Over many weeks prior to the event there were various promotions for the world record attempt including a flash mob in the Dublin City Centre and news paper publications along with a huge amount of networking on Facebook and Twitter. On the weekend of June 18 and 19 the world Record was broken outside Merrion Square in Dublin City with a staggering amount of \\"Wally's\\" big and small gathered on Merrion Square West. The same record was attempted in both Cork City and Portlaoise on June 12 but partially due to heavy rain neither managed to accumulate the same numbers as their Dublin counterparts.http://www.mylittleempire.ie/index.php/2011/06/21/wheres- wally-world-record-attempt-dublin-viral-video-of-the-week/  Winners * 2006: Space Cowboy (Australian Circus and Freak show performer) * 2007: Space Cowboy (Australian Circus and Freak show performer) * 2008: English Gents * 2009: USA Breakdancers * 2010: Jack Wise * 2011: Space Cowboy (Australian Circus and Freak show performer) =Laya Healthcare Street Performance World Championship= Since 2012, Laya Healthcare has sponsored the City Spectacular.

It had an area larger than the Ottoman medieval fortress. The city was surrounded by three stellar belts that could be filled with water.

It follows a shorter film made by the same team in 1992, Little Toot, and uses the same characters established in that film.  Plot  The movie starts with three dogs in a storm. The father sends his children to a safety boat while he stays on his ship. In the morning, Salty the Seagull and Echo the Dolphin notice the dogs and bring them aboard the deck. Echo goes looking for Captain Dogwood, the father of the pups. The pups introduce themselves as Andy and Tina. Salty agrees to help find their father because he knows him. The only way to get to him is with Little Toot, a tugboat who used to be the busiest and proudest until the boats got too big for him and he sat in the docks looking sorry for himself and then got all dirty and messy and became the home for three cats, who make anything miserable. They plan to get rid of them by scaring them, since cats are scared of dogs. At first they get scared, but then when they realize they're just puppies, they feel less impressed. They want them off Toot, but they refuse saying they need him to collect sardines. They also fret to put them overboard where a shark is, until Salty gives Toot the encouragement he needs to get rid of the dogs. Toot uses his hose on the cats since they also hate water. It works and the cats run away. They then start to clean Toot up until he is ship shape again. Echo returns and tells them that Dogwood is shipwrecked on an island. As Salty goes to collect his most favorite food, Percy's Perfect Purple Pickle Pelican Pellets, while the rest gets bubble gum and ice cream. Claude, the cat leader, vows to get Little Toot to get all the sardines. As Salty boards Toot, the gang travels many miles and destinations until they meet the weather lady. She proclaims that she knows what happen to Dogwood, saying she made the storm because it is her job to create the weather. She warns them that she must have her job to make sure the weather changes. She soon starts her weather storm and the gang battles through the weather. Meanwhile, the cats try to get to Toot, but it is difficult for them to battle the weather. They call out to them, and Salty swims back to help them. When Salty points that they're heading towards Skull Rocks, the cats beg to return to their boat, only for it to sink. Lucky, Echo calls out to Toot to surf. By the time they get it out safely, the weather stops. The pups congratulate Toot, while Salty orders the cats to clean up Toot, much to their chagrin. They make it to the island and find Dogwood's ship partly wrecked but safe. While Salty and the pups go to find Dogwood, Toot falls asleep and the cats use the rope to tie the captain's ship to Toot, because they think that there are sardines in the kitchen. They find Dogwood. Dogwoods wakes up, happy to see his kids and Salty. Suddenly the volcano starts to erupt and they get on Toot and sail out, while the cats manage to tie the ship on to Toot and get towed away. Lava blocks their way, but Toot has an idea. They put all the bubblegum in his mouth and he starts to blow a humongous bubble. They fly over the lava just in time. As they float back down, they all congratulate Little Toot saying there's still lots more for Little Toot and he replies that he'll never feel sorry for himself again. As for the cats, they try to find the sardines, only for Dogwood to reveal that he threw them overboard to lighten the boat, much to the cats dismay. When Toot compromises that they might like the pickles, Salty throws a fit refusing to share the pickles because he loves them then starts to talk out of control until he starts to laugh. Everyone begins to have a good laugh, except for the cats who decide to eat whatever is left on the ship and depressed that they don't have any sardines. As the rest of the gang laughs, they all head back to the harbor to get ready for more adventures.

The self-ruling Imperial Abbey was secularized in the course of the German mediatization of 1802‚Äì1803 and its territory annexed to the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg. The monastery was closed in 1850. The buildings of the former abbey now house a hospital. History In 1221, a branch of a sister community was formed at Hochmauern, south of Rottweil, thus founding the future monastery. On 9 May 1224, Pope Honorius III inducted the monastery into the General Chapter of the Cistercians. The Abbot of Salem, Eberhard von Rohrdorf, appointed the first Abbess, Williburgis. In 1237, Emperor Frederick II raised Rottenm√ºnster to imperial immediacy and commended the protection of the monastery to the imperial city of Rottweil. Through donations and dowries, the monastery collected land between the Black Forest and Swabian Alb. The lands contained about 3,000 inhabitants and produced an annual income of about 30,000 guilders (in 1803). The Abbess was a member of the Imperial Diet and the Swabian Imperial Circle. After the peak of 100 nuns at the end of the 14th century, the general population settled to between 20 and 30 nuns. During the Thirty Years' War, the monastery was looted by roving troops, and in 1643 the monastery was burned down by troops of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg. In 1662, only 14 women under vow and three lay nuns lived in the monastery. In the 18th century, the number of sisters rose to above 30. As a result of the Final Recess of 1803, the territory of the monastery was secularized and taken over on 23 November 1802 by W√ºrttemberg. Some 24 women under vow, four novices, and 14 lay sisters remained in the monastery. In 1826, the last Abbess Juliana Mayer died. In 1850, the last living sister, Franziska Gaupp, left the monastery.

In his first year, he lost several fights, but improved results, including a win over Wickwar in October 1933 led to a fight for the Leicestershire Welterweight title, which he won by beating Herbie Nurse. A run of victories, including a non-title fight against British welterweight champion Harry Mason, led to a challenge for Mason's title at Granby Halls, Leicester, in December 1934, which he won with on a points decision. By this point in his career Butler had fought 79 times, losing 13 fights. He fought several non-title fights in the month that followed and after suffering a first round defeat to Harry Woodward on 10 January 1935, he resigned as British champion, saying \\"I cannot go on like this. I must give up boxing for a time and take a long rest before returning to the ring.\\" He soon returned, however, but he was hampered in 1935 by injury and illness including a septic arm, an ulcer on his eyelid, and a foot injury which turned septic. He was due to challenge Gustave Eder for his European welterweight title in March 1935, but the fight was cancelled with Butler needing to take a rest from boxing.

It was one of three first-generation microlensing searches started in the early 1990s, the others being the independent EROS and OGLE projects. The MACHO project was carried out by a team of US and Australian astronomers; observations used the 1.27 metre (50 inch) telescope at the Mount Stromlo Observatory near Canberra, which was dedicated to the project full- time from 1992 until 1999. The project did not solve the dark matter problem, but placed important upper limits on the fraction of dark matter in MACHOs across a wide range of masses, and achieved several notable discoveries in the field of microlensing, and new results on several classes of variable stars.  Microlensing  If a compact object (which may be dark or bright) is located very close to the line of sight to a background star, then gravitational lensing causes the star to appear to split into two images on opposite sides of the compact object (or a complete ring if the alignment is almost perfect). Microlensing refers to the special case of lensing where the two images are too close to be seen as separate objects in a telescope, but the time-varying geometry (as the source and lens move) causes the apparent brightness (the sum of the two images) to vary with time; this variation has a characteristic shape which can be calculated theoretically. Microlensing is predicted and observed to be very rare, typically less than 1 star per million microlensed at any given moment in time, but it is a powerful technique because the effect relies only on the gravity of the lensing object, rather than its light: therefore it is sensitive to completely dark or very faint objects including black holes, substellar brown dwarfs and remnants of dead stars (e.g. old white dwarfs and neutron stars). For these reasons, microlensing is very useful for testing whether dark matter is made of such objects.  Observations  The 1.27-metre telescope at Mt. Stromlo was refurbished for the project, and equipped with a prime-focus wide-field corrector, a dichroic beamsplitter and a pair of 16 megapixel CCD cameras (from 1992-1995, this was the largest CCD system in astronomical use). The cameras imaged a 42 x 42 arcminute square field of sky in two colours (blue- green and red light) simultaneously. Every clear night, the system monitored dense star fields, up to 80 fields in the Large Magellanic Cloud or 100 fields in the Galactic Bulge on a regular basis, with each field observed from twice per night to weekly, depending on field priority and season. From this image data, light curves (brightness vs time) were constructed for over 8 million stars in the LMC, and 15 million stars in the Bulge; large computer searches were then run to find brightening events characteristic of microlensing, and also variable stars.  Results  The project made a number of notable discoveries documented in around 35 scientific papers published between 1993-2003: the most important results were firstly, upper limits on the contribution of MACHOs to the dark matter in the Milky Way: no more than xx percent can be composed of MACHOs between xx solar masses () and xx solar masses;secondly, confirmation that microlensing occurs as expected, based on large samples of events with the theoretically predicted properties. The project also achieved several \\"firsts\\" in microlensing, including the following: * The first strong detection of microlensing of a star, in 1993. * First real-time announcement of an ongoing microlensing event, in 1994. * First observation of parallax effects in a microlensing event, in 1995. Later developments The MACHO project completed observations in December 1999; after 2000 the telescope+camera system was then used for a supernova search, but this was cut short when the telescope was destroyed by the January 2003 Canberra bushfires. Several other microlensing surveys continued, including the OGLE and MOA projects, with the main focus after 2000 changing towards microlensing as a method for detection of exoplanets. Microlensing planet searches are especially sensitive to low-mass exoplanets and those in fairly wide orbits (many astronomical units, beyond the snow-line), and are also the only way of detecting \\"orphan planets\\" ejected from their parent systems; so microlensing planet searches are complementary to the better-known radial velocity and transit methods. As of 2017 the new Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) is a new-generation microlensing survey. The future NASA WFIRST space mission (planned launch c.2024) includes a substantial microlensing planet survey as one of its key projects.

It dated from the eleventh century and was considered one of the finest buildings in Romanesque style in the Netherlands. The church was demolished in stages during the first half of the nineteenth century. Today only the cloister at the Mariaplaats remains, behind the Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen which houses the Utrecht Conservatory. History St. Mary's Church was said to be founded jointly by Henry IV and Conrad, Bishop of Utrecht as the western culmination of the kerkenkruis of Utrecht. Conrad was a loyal supporter of Henry IV during the Investiture Crisis. He accompanied him during his expedition in Italy in 1083 and was present at his coronation as emperor in 1084. The church was located further west in the kerkenkruis because the location in the immediate west of the Traiectum was already occupied by business district Stathe, and the Buurkerk. From 1085 onward Conrad spend more time in Utrecht, and it is postulated that the construction of St. Mary's Church started around this time. The church was built to resemble the Speyer Cathedral in mind as an example, which served as the most eminent church of Henry IV, and which was the burial church of the Salian dynasty. As such St. Mary's Church became a symbol of the emperor. In 1099 the construction of the St. Mary's Church had advanced to a point that the choir could be inaugurated. In the same year however, Conrad was murdered, and the construction came to a standstill. Only after an episode in 1133, when Floris the Black entrenched himself in St. Mary's Church during his raids of the diocese, construction was resumed, albeit under a different plan: the nave and the west side were performed in Lombard style, which gave St. Mary's Church a remarkable Italian appearance, unlike anything found north of the Alps. Around 1160 two towers were added next to the westwork. At this point, St. Mary's Church had a very grand, monumental stature. Unlike the other Romanesque churches in Utrecht, it had two further transepts, was entirely vaulted in stone and additionally had stands above the aisles. St Mary's Basilica was linked to a chapter of thirty canons. In 1421 the relatively modest Romanesque choir was replaced by a much larger Gothic choir. The windows in the west wall were also modernized. A picture of Emperor Henry was placed. In 1528 the painter Jan van Scorel became canon of St. Mary's Church; among other things he designed a rood screen and some stained glass windows. After his death he was buried in St. Mary's Church, his tomb becoming the first elaborately decorated grave ever to be given to an artist in the Netherlands. The church' decline began during the siege of Vredenburg in 1576, when the north tower was destroyed by cannon fire. After the Reformation, the church was taken in use by the Anglican Communion and the choir was re-purposed to serve as an exhibition space. In 1682 the remaining tower was demolished followed by the demolition of the entire west side in 1715. The lifting of the chapter in 1811 eventually led to the destruction of the church. Emperor Napoleon ordered the demolition of the church in 1813 for the proceeds from the sale of materials. The demolition was complete by 1816 leaving only the Gothic choir, which had served as a concert hall since 1764. This too was finally demolished in 1844, making way for the new Gebouw voor Kunsten en Wetenschappen.  Cloister  the cloister The cloister of St. Mary's Church was spared because at the time of the demolition of the church it resided on the territory of the Old Catholic Church. Of the three arms is the western arm is the oldest, originating in the eleventh century. The other arms arose around 1140. During later repairs of the cloister, the original tuff walls were replaced by brick. The columns and capitals are sandstone. The westarm was rebuilt in 1633. Restorations took place during the early twentieth century.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The Henry Sherburne House stands on the west side of The Hill, a cluster of historic houses southwest of the junction of Deer and High Streets. Many of these houses, the Sherburne House among them, were relocated to this area as part of a road widening project. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboarded exterior, set facing west toward Deer Street near its junction with Russell Street. Its front-facing roof is pierced by three gabled dormers, whose scrolled pediments echo that found above the main entrance. The front facade is five bays wide, with the main entrance at its center, flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature and elaborate broken scrolled pediment. The roof line is adorned with a heavy modillioned cornice. This house was built sometime between 1766 and 1770, and originally faced east toward Deer Street prior to being moved to this location. It is an unusually large house for this part of Portsmouth in the late Georgian period. Its front doorway is also distinctive, as the only known in situ scrolled pediment doorway to survive from the period in the entire state. It is believed that this pediment was used as a model by preservationist Wallace Nutting when he undertook the restoration of the Wentworth-Gardner House.

He is best known for being a Vine and Snapchat celebrity. As of June 2014, he was the fourth most followed individual on Vine. That same month he became one of the first Snapchat celebrities. After starting several businesses in China and Canada, Jarre started posting videos on Vine the day of its launch. Thereafter he left his business to completely focus on Vine. In May 2013, he co-founded GrapeStory, a talent agency for Vine and Snapchat stars. In 2014, he turned down a $1,000,000 offer from a top NYC advertising agency because the product clashed with his principles. In March 2017, he started a campaign for Turkish Airlines to deliver aid to Somalia, which garnered the attention of Ben Stiller, Nas Daily, Sarah Silverman, Casey Neistat, Colin Kaepernick, Juanpa Zurita, and other celebrities and influencers. As of September 2017, he helped to raise nearly $4,000,000 to aid people in Somalia suffering from a recent drought. He has posted many videos on Twitter advocating the Somali people and country. He has more than 15 million followers across social media.  Early life and education  Jarre was born in Albertville, France and was raised by his single mother, Agnes Jarre. At 19, he dropped out of Kedge Business School after moving to China. He stayed in China for one year and learned to speak English and Chinese, and created different startups.  Career  =Entrepreneur= In China, Jarre started several businesses, one of which became successful and he used the money to move to Toronto and co- founded a software company, Atendy, with Christopher Carmichael. =Creator= While he was in Toronto, he heard about Vine's launch and made an account on the platform. He then moved back to Paris, France and started making Vines while he was still managing his business and later left his business to completely focus on Vine.  Livestream direct cash transfer  Jarre partnered with the American Refugee Committee (ARC) to develop a new humanitarian model. On September 20, Love Army was invited to present their humanitarian work at the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation event GOALKEEPERS during the 2017 United Nations General Assembly. Other presenters included Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Justin Trudeau, and Malala Yousafzai. Jerome Jarre, Casey Neistat and Juanpa Zurita took the stage on behalf of Love Army and ARC. Simultaneously, the ARC team was on the ground with 1000 beneficiaries in 8 different villages gearing them up to receive a life changing mobile money transfer. In a historical first, a livestream was set up between the beneficiaries and the GOALKEEPERS event, which meant everyone there was able to see just where the money raised was going. With everything in place Jerome and his team did something that came as a surprise to everyone in attendance. With no warning, they asked Bill and Melinda Gates to help them meet their fundraising goal of $1 million. The Gates‚Äô agreed and in moments Abdirashid Duale, the CEO of Dahabshiil who was in the audience, was able to transfer the funds from his phone live. Each and every one of the 1000 beneficiaries instantly received $1000, and the moment was captured via livestream. = Social Media = Vine Jarre posted his first Vine in January 2013 on the day Vine launched. Three months after the launch of Vine, he released a video titled Don't be afraid of love, which became one of the earliest viral videos on Vine and was featured twice on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Six months after starting his Vine account, he had 20,000 followers. Most of his vines feature him playing pranks on strangers. According to Jarre, after being featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, his account grew from 20,000 followers to 1 million followers in a month. Subsequently, Ellen asked him to cover the Red Carpet ceremony of the 86th Academy Awards, where he made multiple vines with Hollywood actors. Later he was hired by Canal+ to cover 2014 Cannes Film Festival. At the Tribeca Film Festival 2014, he was one of the jurors of the 6 second films competition. In November 2013, Jarre started a project on Vine called Humans. In this project, he asks strangers the question \\"what is the most important message you would like to share with the world right now?\\". The videos of this project have been posted under a separate Vine account, Humans. BuzzFeed's Arielle Calderon wrote of Jarre's series that \\"this Vine project will restore your faith in humanity.\\" Jarre has made many vines with several of Hollywood's artists including Robert De Niro, Pharrell Williams, Ashton Kutcher, Ben Stiller, Ansel Elgort, Beyonce, Ariana Grande and Kristen Bell. In 2015 Jarre left Vine. Snapchat After gaining 7 million followers on Vine, Jarre made an account on Snapchat and started using the platform where he makes two-minute narratives for telling stories. Jarre created a snapchat story with Stromae about a carrot looking for his father (Stromae) On 11 July 2014, Jarre went outside Snapchat's office and tweeted \\"Hey Snapchat, I am outside your office. Let me in if you see this.\\" The hashtag #JeromeInsideSnapchat that he used for his tweet trended at #1 in the US and the UK. He was then asked to come into the Snapchat office, where he made a Snapchat story with the CEO Evan Spiegel. On one occasion he shared the story on Snapchat and received twenty-six million views. Ugly Selfie Challenge In 2015 Jarre started the #UglySelfieChallenge, inviting people to stop trying to take perfect selfies, and post selfies making silly faces; everyone had to nominate three more people to do the same. More than 100,000 ugly faces photos were published. = GrapeStory = GrapeStory is a talent agency founded by Jarre and Gary Vaynerchuk in May 2013. The agency connects mobile content artists with brands looking for marketing content. After gaining a significant following on Vine, Jarre decided to launch a talent agency for Vine, Instagram and Snapchat stars. Jarre was looking for a business partner when he learnt that Vaynerchuk was going to be in Toronto. Jarre had taught himself English by listening to an audio version of Vaynerchuk‚Äôs self-help book, Crush It! when he was in China. When Jarre pitched his idea, Vaynerchuk liked it and decided to become his business partner. Jarre then left his business in Toronto and moved to New York to work on GrapeStory. As of August 2013, the agency had between 20 and 30 Vine stars signed on, among others. = Litre of Light (The Solar Light Mission) = Jarre launched a campaign where likes on the posts are currency and plastic bottles are used to light up the communities in rural Philippines. This one time he turned 150K Instagram likes into a lit up village in the Philippines.  Controversies  Jarre was strongly criticized by the Vine community for posting a Vine in which he played a kiss prank on John Stamos and Stamos returned the kiss. The vine was posted in June 2014, and the commenters accused him of being gay and threatened to unfollow him for it. Jarre posted a follow-up Vine video the next day to call out these individuals directly. In it, he claimed he's not gay, then proceeded to kiss a fellow Vine star Nicholas Megalis on the mouth to show support for the LGBT community. On January 5, 2014, Nash Grier and Jarre turned up at a mall in K√≥pavogur, Iceland to meet their fans. The meet up was organized by the two of them on the social media a day before. They wanted to do a free meet-up, so decided against booking a venue and hiring security. Over 5,000 people gathered there and the police had to be called after the crowd became unmanageable. Minor injuries and damages to the parked cars were also reported. Later Jarre posted an apology on Twitter.

The village was important as a stagecoach stop. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Smith's Corner is located in northwestern South Hampton, a rural community in southeastern New Hampshire. New Hampshire Route 107A, Main Avenue in South Hampton, was historically a stagecoach route connecting Amesbury and Newburyport, Massachusetts to Kingston, New Hampshire. This part of South Hampton was agricultural from its settlement in the 18th century, but when the stage route was opened in the 19th century, it developed as a service stop on that route. It featurered several taverns, of which the Smith House at Main Avenue and Stagecoach Lane is one that still survives. The George Goodwin House, located a short way west of that junction, was also given a tavern license. Other properties around the junction were used in other aspects of service in the stagecoach industry. The buildings in the district are all now residential and/or agricultural in use. The district includes one of South Hampton's oldest houses, the c. 1750 Moses Eaton House on Stagecoach Road, and several other 18th-century Georgian houses. The Eaton House is a particularly well-preserved example of a New England connected farmstead. The most prominent buildings were built in the mid-19th century for the stage trade, and are Greek Revival character.

The current building, which opened in 2002, is located at 55 High Street. The previous library building at 194 High Street was constructed in 1932 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Early library history in Candia dates back to 1824 with the formation of the Candia Library Literary Society. Over the course of many years it changed its name, but there was always a lending library of some description. History In the middle of the nineteenth century, Frederick Smyth was a Candia native who had left his hometown and become successful in business and politics. He made a considerable fortune in banking and railroads, and was governor of New Hampshire from 1852 to 1854 and again in 1864. In 1888 the private library system in Candia was in severe straits. Local residents called upon then ex- Governor Smyth for help. He pledged $1,000 to open up a library for public use. The first meeting of the Smyth Public Library Association was in May 1888, and Candia had its first library. Fundraising began to buy books, and the library had 740 titles when it first opened. The building it occupied then is known as the Fitts Museum today. Due to the generous nature of Governor Smyth and his wife Marion, a sum of money was donated to the Library Association to build a new library. The resulting brick building on the hill at 194 High Street opened in 1932; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. New building Candia's new Smyth Public Library opened in December 2002. It is situated between the Candia Elementary School, the Candia Park, and the new (2004-5) Candia Town Pond & Natural Area; it is linked to all three via a new sidewalk and trail system. Among the library's features is a working fireplace in the leisure reading area, an art display gallery, and an outdoor reading garden with extensive perennial flower plantings and comfortable benches overlooking the pond. The mission of Smyth Public Library is to provide and ensure access to books, information, materials, and services that fulfill the educational, informational, cultural, recreational, and professional needs of Candia's residents in a welcoming, respectful, and supportive environment.

It was built in 1900 with later additions and alterations, and is a two-story, Italian Renaissance Revival style red brick building. It features an arcade of rounded compound arches or archivolts. From 1900 until 1936, the building served as a power substation for the Columbia Electric Street Railway, Light & Power Company and its successors. The Columbia Electric Street Railway, Light & Power Company Substation is architecturally significant for its distinctive Italian Renaissance Revival characteristics and historically significant for its direct association with Columbia's street railway or trolley system. The building was designed by W. B. Smith Whaley, an architect well known for his cotton mills throughout the American southeast. The substation, like many of Whaley's designs, is typically Italian Renaissance Revival in many of its defining features. The primary construction material is monochromatic red brick, laid in common or American bond pattern. The primary architectural element is the arcade of rounded compound arches or archivolts springing from broad piers. The massing is heavy, solid, and imposing. This weightiness is further emphasized by the flat roof and the recessed window and door openings. The substation was renovated in 1912 to meet the growing needs of the burgeoning trolley system - the electrical equipment was upgraded, three bays were added to the west end of the building, a second story was added within the volume of the building, the original office space was removed, and the tile floor was replaced with reinforced concrete throughout the building. A monitor roof was also installed (though removed at a later date), and the cornice on the west elevation was removed and reused on the extended north elevation. From its construction in 1900 until 1936, when the trolley system permanently discontinued service, the building served as a power substation (and briefly as the general offices) for the Columbia Electric Street Railway, Light & Power Company and its successors. The trolley system operated by this company and powered by the substation played an integral part in the creation, growth, and subsequent annexation of Columbia's suburbs during the early twentieth century. These developments are illustrative of the broad pattern of trolley-based public transportation and suburban expansion of many American cities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.

Nihal was the world under-10 champion in 2014 in Durban, South Africa. In 2015, he tied for first place in the world under-12 championship in Porto Carras, Greece taking the silver medal on tiebreaks. Early childhood Nihal was born on 13 July 2004 in Thrissur in the Indian state of Kerala.

By the time he was in upper kindergarten, he was speaking fluently in English. By the time he turned six and enrolled into the first standard he knew the multiplication tables till sixteen. Nihal learned chess at the age of six. In order to not make him feel bored during school vacations, his father introduced Nihal to a chess set and his grandfather A. A. Ummar taught him the rules at Kottayam where he was a student of Excelsior English School. Nihal was formally taught chess by Mathew P. Joseph Pottoore, the school's chess coach who instructed once a week in the beginning. He defeated him within a short time span and his family had to search for a new coach.  First successes  In 2011-12, Nihal and his family moved to Thrissur where Nihal joined Devamatha CMI Public School. Nihal won the Kerala state championship in Under-07 category in 2011, the Under-09 title twice, the Under-11 title twice and Under-15 (Sub-Junior) title once.

The event marked Nihal's first game against the legendary five-time world champion Anand who graciously commented after the game, \\"Going by the evidence so far, I would not rule it out (Nihal becoming a world champion in future). It‚Äôs a long journey forward. At the end, he is just 14. I felt that he would really struggle in this tournament and he would be a bit out of place. It seemed the opposite. He seemed quite comfortable here. Not fully there, but he‚Äôs a huge talent what I‚Äôve seen of him.\\" Anand was quoted as saying by PTI. Nihal ended 2018 with a spectacular performance at the World Blitz Championship in Saint Petersburg, Russia where he scored 13¬Ω/21 with a rating performance of 2777, taking the 11th place on tiebreak. Nihal was an integral part of the Indian Chess Team that won the FIDE Online Chess Olympiad 2020.  Training  Nihal's early coach Mathew P. Joseph Pottoore taught him the basics and made him fall in love with chess. From this point on, Mr. M.B. Muralidharan, Prof. N.R. Anil Kumar, Mr. C.T. Pathrose & K.K. Manikantan helped him to polish his skills. Nihal was trained by E.P. Nirmal from 2013 until 2015, helping him develop from a raw talent to a rising player. He has been trained by Dimitri Komarov and Srinath Narayanan has trained him since 2016. Since 2016, Nihal began working independently on his game as well.  Popularizing chess  In his effort to popularize the sport of chess at the grassroots level, Nihal occasionally performs Simultaneous Exhibitions. At the age of 10 years at Thodupuzha, Kerala, he played simultaneously against 112 players of all age categories winning all his games. He was also a guest competitor in the Malayalam TV quiz show Aswamedham in March 2015. It is a popular Malayalam reverse quiz game show hosted by G.S. Pradeep and aired on Kairali TV. On the occasion of Children's Day in 2016, Nihal was chosen as one of the recipients of 'National child award for exceptional achievement' awarded by the then President of India Mr. Pranab Mukherjee. On the day Nihal had become a grandmaster, his home state Kerala was ravaged by the 2018 Kerala floods, the biggest natural disaster in the state's history. Nihal contributed by raising Rs. 174,463/- (approximately US$2500) via a live YouTube show hosted by Indian chess news portal ChessBase India.

Early life and education Charles de Visscher was born in Ghent on 2 August 1884. Orphaned at twelve years old following the death of his father, a professor at Ghent University, Charles de Visscher and his younger brother Ferdinand (d. 1964) were placed in the care of Abb√© Watt√©. The elder de Visscher attended Ghent University where he earned his Docteur en Droit‚Äîat the time, an initial law degree‚Äîgraduating 8 October 1907. He earned a second degree, this time in political science, graduating 2 February 1909. Career In 1911, de Visscher became professor at the Ghent University faculty of law. He taught courses on civil law, criminal law and private international law, succeeding Alb√©ric Rolin. After World War I, de Visscher worked as a legal advisor to the Belgian Foreign Ministry. In 1924, he was elected Dean of the Ghent University faculty of law. In 1931, de Visscher left Ghent University due to the Flamenpolitik, and began teaching at the Catholic University of Louvain. First appearing before the Permanent Court of International Justice was in 1927, de Visscher served as counsel for the Romanian government during their dispute over the Danube Commission. In 1931, de Visscher represented Poland in Access to, or Anchorage in, the Port of Danzig of Polish War Vessels, and subsequently in Treatment of Polish Nationals and Other Persons of Polish Origin or Speech in the Danzig Territory. His final appearance as counsel before the Permanent Court was in 1933, where he represented Denmark in Legal Status of Eastern Greenland. Following the death of Judge Rolin- Jaequemyns in 1936, de Visscher was appointed as Belgium's ad hoc judge in the Permanent Court of International Justice. He was elected a full judge in 1937, in which position he served until the court's dissolution. He subsequently served on the International Court of Justice from 1946 until 1951. Couvreur states that the consensus is de Visscher's not being re-elected, while unexpected, was due to \\"the subtle interplay of political equilibria\\", rather than any particular failing of de Visscher himself. After leaving judicial work, de Visscher returned to academia, but also participated in arbitral bodies. In 1954 de Visscher became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1966, the American Society of International Law awarded de Visscher the Manley O. Hudson Medal. Personal life Charles de Visscher's wife H√©l√®ne (n√©e Mertens) died on 2 August 1958. The couple's marriage bore seven children. The eldest, Jacques de Visscher, died near the Albert Canal on 10 May 1940 while on a mission. Two sons became priests, while another became a monk. Paul de Visscher went on to teach law at the Catholic University of Louvain. Two grandchildren also teach law: Fran√ßoise Leurquin-de Visscher and Fran√ßois Ost.

Aoki found significant success among the American upper class and was known for hosting social events. Guests of his are alleged to have included John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan. He was born in Yokohama, Japan in 1854. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1880 at the invitation of a department-store owner. Upon his arrival, he began work as a commercial artist for the Deakin Brothers of San Francisco. He also worked as a cartoon illustrator for a San Francisco newspaper. Eventually, he became one of the preeminent Japanese artists working in the United States. He later relocated to Pasadena, California, where he received commissions to decorate the interiors of Art and Craft houses whose architecture, such as the famed Greene and Greene bungalows, often reflected Japanese aesthetics. During this time, he was also featured in an article by the \\"Los Angeles Herald\\", entitled \\"To See Yourselves As Aoki Sees You\\". It was clear that he had already gained prominence. He was active until 1910 and died in San Diego on April 26, 1912.[2]Edan Hughes, Artists in California, 1786-1940, as cited in AskArt.com Not much is known about his personal life and marriage; however, he is known to have adopted a seven-year-old girl named Tsuru. While being based in Pasadena, Aoki maintained a studio in San Francisco where he met Tsuru and her guardians. Aoki \\"painted portraits and murals in the homes of prominent people and became very successful.\\" His works were handled by George T. Marsh & Company. He exhibited at the World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893, and the Art Institute of Chicago gave him a showing in 1924. The Fine Arts Gallery of San Francisco State University said of him: \\"Much of Aoki's early life in Japan is speculation, ranging from artistic pursuits (student of acting, or street artist) to the grand and spectacular (a Samurai opposed to the new Japanese government). . . . [he painted] 'spontaneous seki'e ('on the spot' or 'before the viewers' eyes'). He built a reputation as a storyteller, sketching comical figures and eventually landing an illustrating job with the San Francisco Call.\\"Fine Arts Gallery, Department of Art, San Francisco State University After moving to Pasadena, Aoki \\"worked hard to shed his reputation as an amusing character and storyteller and to be taken seriously as an artist. He began to work on 'Oriental receptions,' creating an atmosphere of a Japanese masquerade ball.\\" He died on June 26, 1912.  Biography  Toshio Aoki was born in 1854 in Yokohama, Japan. Not much is known about his early life, but he emigrated to the United States around 1880 with in a department store as a commercial artist when Japonisme took prominence during the era. It is unknown on how long he worked under the Deakin Brothers, as he worked for other establishments making decorative works and commissions, then working with G.T. Marsh in 1895 during his time in Pasadena for commercial ventures. Achieving success in California through Nihonga, he created works that utilized Japanese imagery such as deities and icons from the Meiji period. Aoki created works in multiple media, some of them include oil on canvas and Japanese water-soluble media. He was also known as a performer, hosting a cherry blossom dinner at Pasadena where J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller participated, as well as a craftsman due to his works of hand painted parasols and clothing sought out by the governor of Colorado and the vice president of the United States. Though he spent most of his life in San Diego, California, he made work in Pasadena during his later years due to social and economic limitations for the Asian exports. Though known for his involvement in Japonisme art, he wasn't given positive recognition in his home country due to the racial obstacles he faced in America, being considered as a street performer in 1908 when working for G.T. Marsh. Not much is known about his personal life aside from his marriage and divorce from a Caucasian woman during his early years in America and his adoption of Tsuru Aoki. At 1898, Aoki met Tsuru and her guardians, raising her as they faced financial difficulty in California, using his career to provide for her boarding school at Colorado Springs.

Fisher first began creating puzzles in 1981, when he modified two existing Rubik‚Äôs cubes by joining them along one edge to create a new device called the Siamese cube. This has been accredited as the first example of a ‚Äúhandmade modified rotational puzzle‚Äù. Tony Fisher at a puzzle event with one of his puzzles In 1995 Fisher further modified the conventional rotational puzzle design by shifting its cutting planes to create a 3x3x4 cube. This invention was further adapted in the creation of 2x3x4, 3x3x5 and 4x4x5 cube puzzles. Another technique, initially developed by Geert Hellings, rounded the centre piece of a conventional 4x4x4 cube to create additional turning layers for a uniform 2x2x4, 6x6x6 and non-uniform 2x2x6. Fisher‚Äôs Golden Cubes, initially intended to be released as the Millennium Cube, began production in the early 2000s. Created by modifying the Skewb, it is the first example of a rotational puzzle that features just one colour scheme, requiring the solver to restore the cube‚Äôs shape without the visual aid of having separate colours for each side. The Golden Cube is considered to be Fisher‚Äôs most unusual contribution to the design of new combination puzzles, and has been mass-produced by Uwe Meffert. This cube puzzle was followed by the Cube, using the modified mechanism from an Eastsheen 4x4x4 cube, and in 2007 the Hexaminx puzzle, a cubic version of the Megaminx for which Fisher has used new manufacturing techniques involving polyurethane resins. Since 1981 Fisher has designed and crafted around 100 puzzles based on different puzzle mechanisms. As well as puzzle manufacturing, he has also worked for Suffolk County Council as an archaeologist. =Guinness World Record= At the beginning of 2016 he built the world's largest Rubik's Cube, which took him a total 156 hours to build in his garage. It was 1.57 metres tall and weighed 100 kilograms. He released a sped-up video showing how he spent two days working to solve the massive puzzle. In 2017 the Guinness Book of World Records acknowledged Fisher as the creator of the world's largest Rubik's cube, which measured 1.57m long, created in 2016. =Other novelty cubes= In June 2016 Fisher also created the world's smallest functioning Rubik's Cube which measured only 5.6 millimetres on each side. In December 2017 he unveiled a Rubik‚Äôs Cube which was made from 95% ice. His other creations include a Rubik's Cube made from candles; one made from cheese; and one made from chocolate. =Fidget spinner= In June 2017 he unveiled the world largest fidget spinner. The spinner had a diameter of over 3.3 metres, and took him 40 hours to build.  Puzzle designs  Examples of Fisher‚Äôs puzzle designs can be found at the Puzzle Museum, including his Cylinder Cube, Golden Cube, Hexagonal Prism, Truncated Octaminx and Truncated Octahedron.

In 30 seasons as head coach, he led Seton Hall to 10 NCAA Tournaments and two College World Series. He had an overall record of 998-540-11. Coaching career After playing for Ownie Carroll at Seton Hall, Sheppard coached high school baseball. He became the head coach at Seton Hall after Carroll retired at the end of the 1972 season. In Sheppard's first seven seasons (1973‚Äì1979), the Pirates played in six NCAA Tournaments and two College World Series. The team went 22-8 in his first season. It reached the District 2 Regional, where it lost consecutive games to Penn State and Temple. In 1974, Seton Hall went 3-0 in the District 2 Regional to reach the College World Series, where it lost to Southern Illinois, 5-1, and Texas, 12-2. In 1975, the team returned to the College World Series, where it went 1-2 with an elimination-game win over Florida State. The Pirates also qualified for NCAA Tournaments in 1976, 1977, and 1979, reaching the Northeast Regional final against Maine in 1976. Future major leaguers Rick Cerone and Dan Morogiello played for Sheppard during the 1970s. Seton Hall appeared in the NCAA Tournament three more times in the 1980s (1982, 1984, and 1987). Their deepest run came in 1984, when they again lost to Maine in the Northeast Regional final. The program began competing the Big East Conference in 1985. In its first six seasons in the conference (1985‚Äì1990), it won the South Division five times and played in the Big East Tournament five times. It won the tournament in 1987. Sheppard was named Big East Coach of the Year in 1985, 1987, and 1989. Several notable players played for Sheppard in the 1980s: John Morris, Tony DeFrancesco, Pat Pacillo, Rich Scheid, Craig Biggio, John Valentin, Kevin Morton, and Mo Vaughn. In the 1990s, Seton Hall won a regular- season conference championship in 1990 and placed second multiple times but failed to qualify for an NCAA Tournament. Its highest win total came in 1995, when the team went 38-16. Future major leaguers Mike Moriarty, Matt Morris, and Jason Grilli played for Sheppard during the decade. In 2000, Seton Hall returned to the NCAA Tournament. The Pirates went 36-14 in the regular season. They lost in the Big East championship game, but received an at-large bid to the 2000 NCAA Tournament. As the third seed in the Columbia Regional, they went 0-2, losing games to second-seeded Wake Forest and fourth-seeded Liberty. Sheppard missed the entire 2001 season while recovering from triple-bypass surgery. His son, Rob, served as interim coach during the season. Sheppard returned for two seasons but resigned following the 2003 season in controversial circumstances. In March 2003, Steve Politi of the Newark Star- Ledger published an article in which former players and their parents accused Sheppard, an ex-Marine, of using harsh punishments and racial slurs. Others, including other former players, fellow coaches, and media members, defended Sheppard and argued there was no proof of such behavior. Seton Hall conducted a confidential investigation of the incident, the results of which were not published. Sheppard resigned in summer 2003; the university's press release about his resignation cited \\"health reasons and a desire to spend more time with his children and grandchildren.\\" Including games during the 2001, when his son Rob served as interim head coach, Sheppard retired with 998 career victories. Rob served as Seton Hall's interim head coach in 2004 before being named to the position permanently for the 2005 season. =Head coaching record= Below is a table of Sheppard's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach. Personal Three of Sheppard's sons are also baseball coaches. Rob replaced him as Seton Hall's head coach, and Mike Jr. and John are high school baseball coaches. His son-in-law, Ed Blankmeyer, is the manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones. Sheppard is an inductee of the Newark Athletic Hall of Fame (1988) and American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame (2011).

Biography Carlo Dalla Pozza was born in Taranto, in the Southern region Apulia, from Luigi Dalla Pozza, an officer of the Italian Navy from Veneto region, and Cecilia Pontrelli from Apulia. During high school studies at the Liceo Scientifico Battaglini of Taranto, Giovanni De Tommaso, a tough old-style teacher of mathematics, gave him the taste for mathematical problems and for the elegance of proofs. Carlo studied literature and philology at the University of Bari, where he graduated with a dissertation on Renato Serra under the supervision of Aldo Vallone. Throughout his life Carlo manifested his love for Italian literature, in particular for the 19th-century poets Giacomo Leopardi, Giosu√® Carducci (teacher of Serra) and Gabriele d'Annunzio. Among Italian classics he preferred Dante and Torquato Tasso. After his dissertation Carlo studied Theoretical Linguistics with the Italian translator of Ryle's The Concept of Mind, Ferruccio Rossi-Landi, and later at the University of Pisa, before studying Formal Methods at the Catholic University in Milano. A turn in his intellectual career came from his participation to meetings held in Torino by Norberto Bobbio, developing new ideas on problems in the philosophy of law, especially on the work of Hans Kelsen, and on the formalization of deontic logic, working hard on the axiomatization of the principles of a theory of law for Luigi Ferraioli's Principia Juris.Luigi Ferrajoli, Principia juris. Teoria del diritto e della democrazia. vol. 3. La sintassi del diritto, Bari: Edizioni Laterza: 2007 Carlo Dalla Pozza worked for many years as a high school teacher in the province of Taranto, while he was scientifically very active, attending conferences and giving lectures on various occasions. Only around 1990 he obtained a permanent position at the University of Salento, Lecce, first as \\"tecnico laureato\\" and then as \\"ricercatore\\". A petition signed by Italian and foreign scholars asking that he should be promoted to Associate Professor came too late in view of compulsory retirement policies in European academia. Among the influences on his studies on linguistics and Semiotic Textology, Janos Pet√∂fi asked him to work with him in Constanz, but Dalla Pozza preferred to work in Italy where he was very influential through connections with the Society of Logic and Philosophy of Science and the Society of Analytic Philosophy, and also through his lectures in logic, philosophy of science and computer science (mainly in the nineties) at the University of Verona (where he lectured continuously on Logic and Foundations of Computer Science from 1996 to 2002 and also after retirement until 2013), Padua, Bolzano, and his lectures on Deontic Logic at the University of Rome. Besides the influences of Pet√∂fi and Kelsen, his main philosophical ancestors are to be found in Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell and Rudolf Carnap, to whose works he devoted continuous thought. In 1988 he publishes a very classical contribution for a formal treatment of some argument in quantum physics (see references). A link between his interest in linguistics and his work in logic is given by the formal theory of pragmatics (speech acts), based on an original connection between classical logic (concerning the content of the assertion) and intuitionistic logic (concerning the act of assertion). The first move of the theory was published on Erkenntnis in 1995.A pragmatic interpretation of intuitionistic propositional logic (with C. Garola), in Erkenntnis, 43, 1995 (pp.81-109) Presenting his theory of a formalization of pragmatics Dalla Pozza defines the Frege- Reichenbach-Stenius model for the formal treatment of assertions, showing that the main problem with their solution is that the assertion sign (introduced by Frege) can be used only with elementary assertive formulae. He then introduces a set of pragmatic connectives which allows for the construction of complex assertive formulae. The \\"content\\" of assertive formulae is given through the classical interpretation of classical truth-conditional connectives; pragmatic connectives, on the other hand, have an intuitionistic interpretation as justified or not justified. In this way the formal system may treat the justification value of an assertion, distinguishing it from the truth value of the proposition expressed by the formula. Besides explaining the irreducibility of Frege's assertion sign to classical metalogical tools, and introducing the proper foundation of a formal theory of speech acts, Dalla Pozza's theory gives also an original solution to the problem of the compatibility between classical and intuitionistic logic. The Erkenntnis paper was followed by other works on the logic of questions and answers, on deontic logic and on substructural logic (see references below). Dalla Pozza's work has raised interest in different contexts, both in philosophy and computer science (see for instance the work of Richard S. Anderson 2009,Richard Stuart Anderson, Some Remarks on the Frege-Geach Embedding Problem 2009 ad the work of Kurt Ranalter 2008.Kurt Ranalter, \\"A Semantic Analysis of a Logic of Assertions, Obligation and Causal Implication\\" in Fundamenta Informaticae, 84, n.3-4, 2008 (443-470) In 2008 an issue of Fundamenta Informaticae has been devoted to his ideas in formal pragmatics.Fundamenta Informaticae, 84, n.3-4, 2008 Legacy The work by Dalla Pozza has found application in the formalization of legal systems, in the formalization of pragmatics as a theory of speech acts, on a peculiar trend in the philosophy of quantum physics (see the works of Claudio Garola) and on some developments in computer science and logic (see the works by Gianluigi Bellin on a pragmatic interpretation of bi- intuitionism and on co-intuitionistic linear logic).See the papers that can be downloaded from the last part of Bellin's home page Works Lists of his works can be found at Carlo Dalla Pozza‚Äòs home pageWeb page of Carlo Dalla Pozza and on academia.edu,unisalento.academia.edu/CarloDallaPozza from which we take some basic information: * On the logical foundations of the Jauch- Piron approach to Quantum Physics (with G.

It takes as input a set of declarations in a frame language about a domain such as medical research or molecular biology. For example, the names of classes, sub-classes, properties, and restrictions on allowable values. The classifier determines if the various declarations are logically consistent and if not will highlight the specific inconsistent declarations and the inconsistencies among them. If the declarations are consistent the classifier can then assert additional information based on the input. For example, it can add information about existing classes, create additional classes, etc. This differs from traditional inference engines that trigger off of IF-THEN conditions in rules. Classifiers are also similar to theorem provers in that they take as input and produce output via First Order Logic. Classifiers originated with KL-ONE Frame languages. They are increasingly significant now that they form a part in the enabling technology of the Semantic Web. Modern classifiers leverage the Web Ontology Language. The models they analyze and generate are called ontologies.  History  A classic problem in knowledge representation for artificial intelligence is the trade off between the expressive power and the computational efficiency of the knowledge representation system. The most powerful form of knowledge representation is First Order Logic (FOL). However, it is not possible to implement knowledge representation that provides the complete expressive power of first order logic. Such a representation will include the capability to represent concepts such as the set of all integers which are impossible to iterate through. Implementing an assertion quantified for an infinite set by definition results in an undecidable non-terminating program. However, the problem is deeper than not being able to implement infinite sets. As Levesque demonstrated, the closer a knowledge representation mechanism comes to FOL, the more likely it is to result in expressions that require infinite or unacceptably large resources to compute. As a result of this trade-off, a great deal of early work on knowledge representation for artificial intelligence involved experimenting with various compromises that provide a subset of FOL with acceptable computation speeds. One of the first and most successful compromises was to develop languages based predominately on modus ponens, i.e. IF-THEN rules. Rule-based systems were the predominate knowledge representation mechanism for virtually all early expert systems. Rule-based systems provided acceptable computational efficiency while still providing powerful knowledge representation. Also, rules were highly intuitive to knowledge workers. Indeed, one of the data points that encouraged researchers to develop rule-based knowledge representation was psychological research that humans often represented complex logic via rules. However, after the early success of rule-based systems there arose more pervasive use of frame languages instead of or more often combined with rules. Frames provided a more natural way to represent certain types of concepts, especially concepts in subpart or subclass hierarchies. This led to development of a new kind of inference engine known as a classifier. A classifier could analyze a class hierarchy (also known as an ontology) and determine if it was valid. If the hierarchy was invalid the classifier would highlight the inconsistent declarations. For a language to utilize a classifier it required a formal foundation. The first language to successfully demonstrate a classifier was the KL-ONE family of languages. The LOOM language from ISI was heavily influenced by KL-ONE. LOOM also was influenced by the rising popularity of object-oriented tools and environments. Loom provided a true object-oriented capability (e.g. message passing) in addition to Frame language capabilities. Classifiers play a significant role in the vision for the next generation Internet known as the Semantic Web. The Web Ontology Language provides a formalism that can be validated and reasoned on via classifiers such as Hermit and Fact++.  Implementations  Protege Ontology Editor The earliest versions of classifiers were logic theorem provers. The first classifier to work with a Frame language was the KL-ONE classifier. A later system built on common lisp was LOOM from the Information Sciences Institute. LOOM provided true object-oriented capabilities leveraging the Common Lisp Object System, along with a frame language. In the Semantic Web the Protege tool from Stanford provides classifiers (also known as reasoners) as part of the default environment.

They are affiliated to Cavan GAA. History The Story of Ramor United began in 1971, when the 3 clubs in the parish ‚Äì Maghera McFinns, Lurgan GFC and Virginia Blues ‚Äì amalgamated for the Senior Championship only. This coming-together cumulated in the Senior Championship coming to the parish of Lurgan as a whole for the first time in 1974. Following from this, a new sense of parish effort evolved. A well-attended meeting in the courthouse in Virginia in 1976, under the chairmanship of County Board Chairman, Paddy C Donoghue, saw the very large enthusiastic crowd from all corners of the parish favouring a more permanent alliance, namely Ramor United GFC, as a single parish club. The name \\"Ramor United\\" was chosen as it represents Lough Ramor and its embodiment through the Parish, just like Ramor GFC would represent the parish as one entity. Ramor United soon built itself up as a force to be reckoned with within the county. This was emphasised by the capturing of the Junior B Championship in 1978, and both the U-21 Championship and Senior Division 2 League in 1980. In 1982, under the chairmanship of Patsy McDonnell the club bought the \\"Football field\\" from Dick McDonnell, a former Virginia Blues player. The deal allowed the staggering of payment over three years. Huge fundraising was undertaken by the committee and the target was met. The hard working members were already planning the development of the field; the galvanised fence along the road was removed and replaced by a beautiful hedge. A viewing stand, dugouts, goalposts and a railing around the field were erected by the club members. A further acre of ground was purchased for a clubhouse and car park. The new clubhouse was designed by local clubman Jimmy Costello. It now has a fully equipped gym and is often used by other clubs. The clubhouse and football field were officially opened by Peter Brady County Board Chairman on 6 May 1990. It was a proud day for the club and a credit to committee members, players and supporters. The grounds received the \\"most improved grounds award\\" from Cavan Co. Board in 1991. In the meantime Ramor continued to prove themselves where it matters ‚Äì on the football pitch, by winning a historic double in 1985, with the capturing of the Senior Championship and the Senior League Division 1 and repeating success in 1986 with the capturing of the Senior League. Team manager was the well-loved and respected Fr. Tom McKiernan. The buzz and excitement within the club around this time, supported by brand new club facilities and an air of confidence within the team meant that Ramor were up there with the top guns in the county. The 1990s started triumphantly for the Virginia side, winning the Division 1A league title both in 1990 and 1991. 1992 was to be Ramor's year when a young, vibrant team, mixed with experience, and under the guidance of former player John Mulvanny, captured the Senior Championship, beating Bailieboro Shamrocks by a single point in the final. The icing on the cake was the capturing of the Denn Tournament, which is renowned for attracting the best talent of the neighbouring counties. In autumn of 1993, a piece of land ‚Äì about 5 acres adjacent to the clubhouse ‚Äì became available, the club bought the land including access to the lake. In the past few years a viewing stand with wheel-chair access and toilet facilities has been built on the 2nd pitch mainly by the grounds committee. At present, the new pitch is extensively used and has proved itself to be a great foresight by the Committee; the club also have a hard-core running track on the top pitch. The Juniors were worthy winners of the Junior B Championship in 1996 and retained their title in 1997. Ramor won the Senior League in 1996. Ramor won the Senior Division 2 League in 2008 Ramor United won the Cavan Senior Football Championship title in 2016. The kit Ramor United's kit consists of amber jerseys with black trim, black shorts and black socks with amber trim.

Six of these are named \\"Chiesi\\" global pharmaceutical company based in Parma, Emilia-Romagna. Chiesi has 28 affiliates in the world, nearly 6,000 total employees and provides medicines to patients in more than 80 nations. Chiesi currently has revenues of 1.992 billion euros. In June 2019, Chiesi became a certified B Corporation, thus choosing to adopt a new legal status under US and Italian law. This ensures Chiesi a legal protection to pursue a business model placing social and environmental values on equal footing with profits. Following the acquisition, in 1999, of Huddersfield based Trinity Pharmaceuticals, Chiesi has also had a significant presence in Manchester, United Kingdom.http://www.chiesi.uk.com/about_chiesi/ History Established in 1935, Chiesi concentrates primarily on developing respiratory, neonatological and rare disease drugs, along with those for treating muscular and skeletal conditions. Historical therapeutic solutions are a cortisone preparation indicated for asthma, allergic rhinitis and airway inflammation, launched in 1979, and a surfactant life-saving treatment for premature babies, developed by two researchers at Karolinska Institutet, Tore Curstedt and Bengt Robertson. In the rare disease area, a treatment for moderate to severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), developed by the researchers Michele De Luca and Graziella Pellegrini, was the first stem cell therapy to be approved in Europe. As well as developing drugs in-house, Chiesi has a policy of developing drugs in collaboration with pharmaceutical businesses outside Italy. Chiesi's operations regarding neonatological drugs have come under criticism for patenting drugs that Chiesi has not been instrumental in developing. Because of this behavior, some of Europe's neonatology wards have experienced economic hardships.Louise Daml√∏v, \\"Fra en 20‚Äôer til 800 kr: Medicinalfirma h√¶ver prisen p√• livsvigtig medicin til for tidligt f√∏dte b√∏rn\\" at dr.dk, 11 September 2016 The company holds over 4,000 international patents for more than 200 patents families, and employs approximately 800 people dedicated to Research and Development activities, including regulatory in the R&D; centres in Parma, Paris, Cary (North Carolina, USA), Chippenham (UK), Oxford (UK), Lindingo (Sweden) and Toronto (Canada). 2010 was the year in which turnover broke through the Billion Euro barrier, with Chiesi recording sales growth of 16.4% over the figure for 2009. By 2013 turnover had reach ‚Ç¨1,236, with increases coming primarily from outside the Italian home market. Chiesi Farmaceutici closes 2016 on a high with an annual turnover of ‚Ç¨1.571 million, an increase of more than +7.0% on the previous year (+9.6% at constant exchange rates), and EBITDA equal to ‚Ç¨448 million (a year-on-year increase of over 8.2%). The robust health of the company is reflected by its investment in innovation and development, with R&D; expenditure rising by over +12.5% in the 2015‚Äì2016 period to reach ‚Ç¨370 m in 2019, 19% of total sales. The Group currently has 49 active studies in research and development. Caffeine citrate product In 2014 Chiesi was granted a 10 years market exclusivity on a caffeine citrate pharmaceutical product, both for oral and intravenous use, for the treatment of apnoea of prematurity, an orphan condition. Many prematurely-born infants have trouble breathing and because of this they need caffeine citrate, which stimulates the nervous system controlling breathing. The market exclusivity expired on July 17, 2019. The marketing authorization holder set the list price at 800 kroner in Denmark (approx. $120, +4000% compared to the cost of galenic formulation). The EU Orphan Medicinal Product regulation prevents the marketing of galenic formulation without the consent of the orphan drug designation holder. Chiesi was accused to exploit legislation that was created to compensate companies that have had substantial expenses with developing new drugs. Chiesi has not clinically developed this form of medication, but has published two real world studies on a total of 1606 babies across Europe. Chiesi withheld comment on the list price of the drug.  Therapeutic areas  Chiesi Farmaceutici researches and develops therapeutic solutions for respiratory diseases as Asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), both characterized by a reduction in the respiratory flow but driven by a different pathophysiological pathway. New drugs are based on a technology which allows the creation of spray solutions for inhalation of extrafine particles. The company has his focus also on the preterm babies‚Äô care, specifically regarding the treatment of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and apnoea conditions, both due to an under-development of the respiratory system. Natural surfactant administered via intra-tracheal route treats RDS, and may also be used for the prophylaxis in neonates at high risk of developing the disease. For the more severe apnoea episodes stimulant drugs are needed, such as caffeine-based treatments. Chiesi Farmaceutici is developing new therapeutic solutions in the area of rare and ultra-rare diseases. For limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), a rare eye condition that may lead to blindness, a stem cell treatment has been developed and is marketed in Europe. In 2018, Chiesi achieved European marketing authorization for velmanase alfa, a first-in-class enzyme replacement therapy for alfa-mannosidosis, an ultra-rare condition. Chiesi is also present in nephropathic cystinosis and is developing a new product in Fabry disease.

It is classed as a diarylamine and more specifically an arylaminopyridine. Its chemical name is 3-chloro-N-(3-chloro-2,6-dinitro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinamine. The mode of action involves the compound being an extremely potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and also having high reactivity with thiols. It is unique amongst uncouplers in displaying broad-spectrum activity against fungi and also very low toxicity to mammals due to it being rapidly metabolised to a compound without uncoupling activity. It was first described in 1992 and was developed by researchers at the Japanese company Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha. Uses Fluazinam is a protectant fungicide, but is neither systemic or curative. It acts by inhibiting the germination of spores and the development of infection structures. Although it has activity against many fungi, it is less potent against rusts and powdery mildew and as such has not been commercialised for use in cereal crops. It is widely used to control late blight (P. infestans) in potato due to its activity against the zoospores of the pathogen which makes it particularly effective at controlling infection of the potato tubers. Despite its common usage to control late blight, there are no reports of resistance to fluazinam appearing in P. infestans. Fluazinam is also used to control Sclerotinia on peanuts and turf, Botrytis on grapes and beans and clubroot in brassicas. Toxicity The acute oral median lethal dose in rats is very low at over 5000 mg/kg due to the compound's reactivity with thiols. This reactivity can have negative consequences since repeated exposure can cause skin sensitization and dermatitis to develop in some individuals. Fluazinam also displays low toxicity to birds, bees and worms, but has a high toxicity to fish. The toxicity towards fish is considered to be relatively unimportant, since the compound has a very short half-life (around 1 day) in aquatic systems.

This led to the formation of the United Evangelical Church by the Dubsites. Biography He was born in the German part of Baldenheim in Alsace, France in 1823 to Johann Jakob Esher. In 1832, at age nine, he migrated with his parents to Pennsylvania and from there his family moved to Chicago, Illinois. In 1840 he attended divinity school. In 1845 he was ordained and became a charter member of the Evangelical Church. He married Anna Barbara Schneider (1823‚Äì1908) on August 8, 1849.

Bowman was related to Esher by marriage. Esher was tried in absentia on March 20, 1890, by the Evangelical Association in Reading, Pennsylvania. The charges were: \\"Un-Christian conduct, slander, evil speaking and falsehood, creating dissension, and perpetuating and intensifying the agitation in the church, and disturbing her peace by a revival of old and previous adjudicated difficulties and differences.\\" This led to the formation of the United Evangelical Church by the followers of Bishop Dubs.

It was named after Martin Garzez, the Grand Master who financed its construction, even though it was eventually built after his death during the Magistry of Alof de Wignacourt. The tower was demolished in the 19th century, some remains were reused for the building of a bridge, and the site was developed with a hotel. It was built to the design of Vittorio Cassar. A number a coastal towers, built by Grandmaster Wignacourt, are traditionally attributed to Cassar and based on the Garzes tower. However this is probably based on speculations It is likely that Cassar's design of Garzes Tower was used, and adequately modified, to built the other towers due to their similarity in their military architecture. Background In the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries, Gozo was prone to attacks by Barbary corsairs, along with most of Malta and other coastal areas in the Mediterranean and Europe. The harbour of Mƒ°arr was commonly used by pirates to replenish with water and plunder the surrounding area. The worst attack occurred in July 1551, when Ottoman forces aided by corsairs tried to take over Malta but failed so they landed in Gozo, besieged the Cittadela and took almost the entire population of about 5000 to 6000 people as slaves (with the exception of a monk, some 40 elderly Gozitans and about 300 who managed to escape and hide). The slaves were taken aboard Ottoman ships from Mƒ°arr Harbour itself. Before this attack, there had already been proposals to build a tower to guard Mƒ°arr Harbour and the Gozo Channel. In 1418, the people made a petition to build such a tower but nothing materialized. In 1599, a report was made about the defence of Gozo, and the military engineer Giovanni Rinaldini made it clear that a tower was necessary in that area to prevent any future attacks. The Grand Master at that time, Martin Garzez, realized this so he decided to finance the building of a tower himself. He allocated 12,000 scudi for the building of the tower, but he died in 1601 before construction even began. The tower View of Mƒ°arr from the sea, with the site of Garzes Tower on the right Construction of the tower began four years after the Grand Master died, in 1605. It was still under construction in 1607. It was built on a promontory, between Wied il-Kbir and Wied Biljun. The tower had a number of guns mounted on its roof which had equidistant embrasures along each of its sides. In the mid-18th century, a bastioned enceinte was proposed around the tower, but it was never built. Eventually, Fort Chambray was built on the opposite side of Mƒ°arr. The tower had a small chapel dedicated to St Catherine of Siena and later St Martin that was intended for use by the four militia members in the tower but was also open to the public. It became an unofficial parish church for the people of the nearby villages. After 243 years, the tower was demolished in 1848. Its masonry was used to build the bridge linking Mƒ°arr to Nadur. The Mƒ°arr Hotel was built over the site of the tower, but it has since closed down. Legacy Although the tower no longer exists, it still has an important place in Malta's history. This was the first coastal watchtower built by the Order. Garzes' successor, Alof de Wignacourt, later built a series of large watchtowers or small forts that are known as the Wignacourt towers. Other Grand Masters built smaller watchtowers such as the Lascaris and De Redin towers. Since Garzes Tower has been demolished, the oldest tower still standing in Malta is the Wignacourt Tower in St. Paul's Bay, which was built in 1610. The oldest tower on Gozo is the Xlendi Tower that was built in 1650 (a tower in Marsalforn had also been built in 1616 but it collapsed in around 1715).

It has a gable roof and front and rear porches with fluted Roman Doric order columns. About 1890, two Victorian bays and a kitchen wing was added. It was the home of Dr. James Bivings (1781-1869), prominent local textile pioneer, and Dexter Edgar Converse (1829-1899), industrialist, textile entrepreneur, and founder of Converse College. The house has had a number of structural problems in recent decades, especially since it was vacated in around 1961. The original wooden floors were replaced in the 1970s due to termite damage. The original wooden shingled roof was redone with standard asphalt in 1992, but as of 1995 the structure was vacant and had been subjected to vandalism and water damage. It has remained in a state of disrepair as recently as 2015. The shutters on the exterior have been removed and the windows have been boarded up.

Higgins was appointed High Constable of the Home District in 1826, a position that included being inspector of police for York, Upper Canada at a salary of ¬£40 a year. When the city of Toronto was incorporated in 1834, the new city council unanimously appointed Higgins High Bailiff, including the responsibility of being city inspector, with a salary of ¬£125 a year while remaining High Constable (as well as the only constable) for the region. Higgins' term ended in scandal when he was implicated in the death of a man during election day anti-Tory rioting by largely disenfranchised Irish Catholic minority which was put down by a party of Protestant Orangemen, led by Higgins. Mayor William Lyon Mackenzie, in his role as chief magistrate, held a police court investigation and laid charges against Higgins. He was exonerated by the grand jury in April 1835 but, by that point city council had already chosen not to reappoint him.

Discovery and original ownership The hoard was discovered in the late nineteenth century and it was described by the colonial historian Robert Sewell in 1895. The artefacts was subsequently donated by the Secretary of State for India to the British Museum in 1905. Given the religious nature of the sculptures, the cache may have originally formed part of a ritual deposit from a Buddhist temple or monastery. Description The 6th-8th century hoard is composed of fifteen bronze Buddhist images, the vast majority of which are either statuettes or parts of small figures. There are three relatively intact standing statuettes of the Buddha (the largest of which is 38 cm high), 4 bronze arms, two bases for standing figures (one of which has a Brahmi inscription), a representation of the god Tirthankara, two small Buddha heads, two fragmentary figures of Parsvanatha and a bronze model of a stupa.

Vast Countenance toured the Netherlands and the United States. Its albums have been released in several countries. Biography =Start off= Vast Countenance was formed in 1999 with the objective to bring forth own music. Almost all members originate from the cover band Sister Ray (founded on 31 December 1996) ‚Äì Cor Bond and Simon Tol didn't come along. Members continue playing in Sister Ray as well, though, sometimes during one same appearance. The name of the band was invented by the first lead singer, Mario Reurs. For the group members it is an English translation without an additional meaning. They don't link it to Kabbalah of which they initially had never heard of (i.e. in Kabbalah 'Vast Countenance' is the first sephira). The song Sister Ray of Velvet Underground has been the inspiration for the name of their other band. Still quite at the beginning, Johan Molenaar replaced Reurs as the lead singer of the band. In 2004 Vast Countenance released its first album, a demo version that carries the name of the band and contains nine own compositions. The CD was well received and the genre was at that time described by the newspaper Noord Hollands Dagblad as \\"Beatle-style pop with a whiff of rock 'n' roll. = Influences and music style = Vast Countenance's music genre has changed slightly in course of time. It has been qualified by some as part-sung alternative rock and Britpop, as well as a mixture between indie rock and folk by others. Meanwhile it has developed into rock 'n' folk. It combines influences from the 1960s with a contemporary sound, and finds inspiration in the music of The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Velvet Underground, as well as from songwriters like Tim Buckley and Neil Young. The band only produces self written music. Most songs originate from a guitar chords composition of Molenaar, on the basis of which the group writes its songs together. The part sung choirs of the first two albums have been arranged by Nico Tol (Stein). During studio sessions afterwards, the songs are shaped into their final settings. =Reception= In 2006 the music group released its album As We Please in the Netherlands, United States and Japan. The album contained seven newly written songs and three make overs of the first album which were described by the Dutch music magazine LiveXS as \\"a fresh sounding melody machine.\\" The song Clay was released as a single too. Guest appearances on the album were from Peter Bien (trumpet) and Jozef Veerman (keyboards). OOR Magazine reviewed the band in 2007 as follows: \\"From the region of Waterland surprisingly Dutch talent comes sailing along ... 'We're all jugglers juggling with, the endless possibilities of life' is just one of the simple, but pretty formed sentences on the album. The pliant, sunny melodies and beautiful part-sung choirs link up seamlessly with the texts. Extra little points deserve the strong choruses, unexpected transitions and the special singing. Pop as pop is meant to be.\\" OOR was critical on the recording quality of the demo version. = Seattle and San Francisco = In 2008 As We Please got the attention of American music promoter Michael Sudden. He introduced the band to some radio stations around Seattle that resulted in airplay, and in reviews in magazines subsequently. In November of the same year the band traveled along the West Coast during two weeks, where it performed in two clubs in Seattle, and finished its tour with street performances in San Francisco. It received positive reviews, such as \\"Dutch group Vast Countenance gives '60s rock a breathtaking makeover.\\" = 2010s = In 2011 the music group released its album Elephant Child. As a result of the joining of violinist Anne Veerman to the band, the genre can definitely be defined as rock 'n' folk. In its review, the Noord Hollands Dagblad regards the song Not A Bad Moment as world class, with further comments like \\"One by one strong songs ... inimitable melody lines ... really brilliant.\\" Ten songs of Vast Countenance reached the Volendammer Top 1000, an all-time list that was compiled in 2013 by the listeners of 17 regional radio- and television stations.Volendammer Top 1000, playlist, 2013 Cor Schilder (Pan), drummer and one of the singers in the band, was killed on 17 July 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down above Ukraine.

He served as ban of Croatia-Slavonia between 1842 and 1845 during the Croatian national revival and the Illyrian movement in the 1830s and 1840s. Haller was born in Kerel≈ëszentp√°l, Transylvania, as a member of the Hungarian-Transylvanian branch of the Haller von Hallerstein family. He was promoted by emperor Franz Joseph as ban on 16 June 1842 and was later promoted to lieutenant general. He took office on 18 October. Haller was brought in to carry on Magyarization in Croatia. In 1843, the use of the Illyrian name was banned.

Isopu Tower was the last watchtower to be built in Malta, apart from the tour-reduits of the 18th century. It is one of four surviving towers on Gozo, with the others being Xlendi Tower, Dwejra Tower and Mƒ°arr ix- Xini Tower. History Isopu Tower was built by the Order of Saint John in 1667 during the reign of Grandmaster Nicolas Cotoner at the expense of the Universit√† of Gozo. The latter paid for its garrison but artillery was supplied by the Order itself. The tower is square in shape, and the design is similar to the Xlendi and Dwejra Towers. The walls are thick with inward slopes. The tower has a high barrel vault with the middle floor resting on rib arches. A spiral staircase provides access to the various floors. The main doorway had four escutcheons with coats of arms of the Order and the Gozo Universit√†, and the personal arms of Cotoner and the Governor of Gozo. By 1785 the tower was not permanently manned, but in 1792 it was rearmed with four 6-pounder iron guns. It was the only small coastal watchtower which actually tried to resist the French invasion of 1798 when it fired its guns on the approaching French fleet. Present day The tower as seen from land, with the sea in the background By the early 21st century, the tower was in a state of disrepair. Parts of it had weathered while most of the interior had already collapsed. The tower was restored by Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa and the Nadur Local Council between 2003 and 2006. The restoration work was carried out by hand by Leli Saliba and his son. The spiral staircase was completely rebuilt from scratch, as were the roof and most of the interior. Only one of the original arches had survived, and it was used as a model on which to rebuild the roof. The restored tower was reopened on 20 August 2006. Nowadays, the tower is open for visitors on three Sundays in every month, but plans are underway to convert it into a visitor centre as part of a nature trail in the area. The area around the tower has been designated as a special conservation area.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1975 until October 1978 he contested thirty-three races, winning fourteen times, finishing second five times and third seven times. Originally trained in Yorkshire, he won twice as a two-year-old in 1975 before becoming a highly successful handicapper in the following season, when he won the Cecil Frail Handicap, Andy Capp Handicap and the Doonside Cup. He won three races in 1977 including the Group Three Diomed Stakes but appeared to have been well-exposed as a tough, consistent horse who was some way below the best. After joining the stable of Henry Cecil in 1978, however, he emerged as a genuinely top-class horse winning the Earl of Sefton Stakes, Brigadier Gerard Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes, Eclipse Stakes and Valdoe Stakes as well as finishing second in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup and third in the Champion Stakes. After his retirement from racing, he became a very successful sire of National Hunt horses. He died in 2003 at the age of thirty. Background Gunner B was a \\"strong, deep-bodied\\" chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred by Tom Barratt at his Harness Grove Stud in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. He was the best horse sired by the American stallion Royal Gunner, who won the Cornhusker Handicap in 1966 and finished second to Roman Brother and Buckpasser in successive runnings of the Woodward Stakes. Gunner B's dam, Sweet Councillor, was an unraced daughter of Sugarstick, a half sister of the Cambridgeshire Handicap winner Sterope. During his racing career Gunner B raced in the colours of Tom Barratt's wife Pauline. The colt was originally sent into training with Geoff Toft at his stable at Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Racing career =1975: two-year-old season= After running third on his debut, Gunner B finished first in a race over five furlongs at Pontefract Racecourse in May but was \\"unluckily\\" disqualified. He finished placed in his next three races before winning a six furlong maiden race at Newcastle in August. In the following month he won a Nursery (a handicap race for two-year-olds) at Doncaster Racecourse, winning by two lengths from Gemina. =1976: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Gunner B won a minor race over ten furlongs at Doncaster on the opening day of the flat season in March. After finishing fourth on his next appearance he was moved up in class and finished second in both the Dee Stakes at Chester and the Dante Stakes at York in May. He was dropped back to a mile for the Cecil Frail Handicap at Haydock Park at the end of the month and recorded his first important victory, winning by eight lengths, ridden by Joe Mercer. He then won a moderate event over a mile and a half at his local Beverley Racecourse and then carried a big weight to victory in the Andy Capp Handicap at Redcar in early July, after which he was offered at odds of 8/1 for the St Leger Stakes. He then produced a creditable effort in defeat in a one-mile handicap at Beverley, finishing third under a weight of 141 pounds. When Gunner B contested the Gordon Stakes, a recognised St Leger trial at Goodwood however, he ran poorly and finished last of the six runners. Gunner B bypassed the St Leger, running instead in the Doonside Cup over eleven furlongs at Ayr Racecourse in which, ridden by Mercer, he was required to concede weight to older horses including Patch (Great Voltigeur Stakes), Rymer (Brigadier Gerard Stakes) and Dakota (St Simon Stakes, Ebor Handicap). Gunner B tracked the leader Patch before taking the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by half a length from Rymer. at a price of 12‚Äì1. =1977: four-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on his debut as a four-year-old, Gunner B finished third to Lucky Wednesday and Relkino in the Westbury Stakes and third to Oats in the Ormonde Stakes. At Epsom Downs Racecourse in June, Gunner B started at odds of 12/1 in the Group Three Diomed Stakes over eight and a half furlongs. Ridden by Joe Mercer he recorded his first Group race win, beating Duke Ellington by half a length and followed up a week later by winning a minor race at Beverley. He went on to finish fourth to Lucky Wednesday in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot and third to North Stoke in the Land of Burns Stakes at Ayr, before recording a half length win in a race for amateur riders over a mile at Newmarket Racecourse in August. He ran poorly on his only subsequent appearance two days later. =1978: five-year-old season= Although he remained in the same ownership in 1978, Gunner B was transferred to the stable of Henry Cecil at Warren Place in Newmarket. Ridden by Joe Mercer (Cecil's stable jockey), he established himself as the best older horse of the season over ten furlongs. On his first appearance for his new trainer, Gunner B started at odds of 7/2 for the Group Three Earl of Sefton Stakes at Newmarket in April and won from Uncle Pokey and Gairloch. In the Brigadier Gerard Stakes on hard ground at Sandown Park Racecourse in May, the five-year-old started at 2/1 and won again, with Uncle Pokey and Gairloch again following home as he broke the course record established by Artaius in the 1977 Eclipse Stakes. At Royal Ascot in June, Gunner B started the 4/5 favourite for his second attempt to win the Prince of Wales's Stakes and won \\"without difficulty\\" from the Harry Wragg-trained gelding Fluellen and the Prix Messidor winner Malecite. In July, the horse faced a field which included Balmerino, Super Concorde, Radetzky (St James's Palace Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes) and Jellaby (Brigadier Gerard Stakes, Queen Anne Stakes) in the Group One Eclipse Stakes at Sandown. He was made the 7/4 second favourite behind Stradavinsky, a lightly-raced but highly regarded three-year-old trained by Vincent O'Brien. Mercer positioned Gunner B just behind the leaders before moving forward early in the straight. He got the better of a protracted struggle with Radetzky to take the lead entering the final furlong and held off a late challenge from Balmerino to win by three- quarters of a length. In August, Gunner B started second favourite behind The Derby runner-up Hawaiian Sound in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse in a field which also included Balmerino, Julio Mariner, Cistus (Nassau Stakes), More So (Irish 1,000 Guineas), Jellaby, Pyjama Hunt and Don (Lockinge Stakes). Hawaiian Sound took the lead soon after the start and although Gunner B mounted a sustained challenge in the straight he was never able to reach the three-year-old and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. Gunner B was dropped in class for the Valdoe Stakes at Goodwood in September. He started the 4/9 favourite and won by half a length from the three-year-old Admiral's Launch, the winner of the Craven Stakes. Gunner B's final race was the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October, in which he started third favourite behind Hawaiian Sound and the French filly Dancing Maid. He tracked Hawaiian Sound throughout the race, but was unable to quicken in the closing stages, finishing third of the ten runners behind Swiss Maid, beaten three lengths by the winner. Assessment Gunner B did not receive a rating in the 1975 Free Handicap, which rated the best two-year-olds to have raced in Britain. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 106, making him twenty-four pounds inferior to their top-rated juvenile Manado. In the following year, Timeform described him as \\"a grand horse\\" and gave him a rating of 121 fourteen pounds the top-rated horse Youth. In the official British handicap for three-year-olds he was given a weight of 127 pounds, thirteen pounds behind the top-rated Vitiges. He failed to gain a rating in the inaugural International Classification for older horses in 1977, and was rated eighteen pounds behind the top-rated Balmerino in the British Handicap for horses aged four and above. His Timeform rating dropped to 116, although the organisation's annual Racehorses of 1977 described him as \\"thoroughly genuine and a doughty battler\\". In the International Classification for 1978, Gunner B was rated the fifth-best older male in Europe, behind Alleged, Buckskin, Crow and Guadanini. Timeform gave him a rating of 126, twelve pounds behind their Horse of the Year Alleged. Stud career At the end of the 1978 season, Gunner B was syndicated for ¬£9,000 a share, giving him a theoretical value of ¬£360,000. He began his career a breeding stallion at the Limestone Stud in Lincolnshire at a fee of ¬£3,000. After a brief spell in Germany he was moved to the Shade Oak Stud in Shropshire, where he remained for the rest of his life. Gunner B's offspring made relatively little impact on the flat, apart from Royal Gait, an outstanding stayer who was controversially disqualified after winning the Ascot Gold Cup before going on to win the Champion Hurdle, and the Lincoln Handicap and Earl of Sefton Stakes winner K-Battery. After his return from Germany however, he became a very successful National Hunt stallion. Apart from Royal Gait, he sired the Grand National winner Red Marauder, the World Hurdle winner Iris's Gift, Red Striker (Peter Marsh Chase), Bobby Grant, Barrow Drive, Gunner Welburn, Swingit Gunner and Forest Gunner. He received several awards from the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association for his achievements as a sire of jumpers. On 18 January 2003, Gunner B died of heart failure at Shade Oak and was buried at the stud. At the time of his death he was believed to be the oldest active stallion in Europe. The stud's owner, Peter Hockenhull said \\"He put us on the map ‚Äì he's practically built this place ... a Gunner B would always win a race somewhere, somehow\\" and added \\"He had the vet out just twice in 13 years. He would have carried on this year, as the physical side of covering was not a problem, though with his age he did have declining fertility\\".

Shot in August 2014 during Pitt and Jolie's honeymoon in Gozo, Malta, the film was released by Universal Pictures on November 13, 2015. The film received mixed reviews and did not do well at the box office, grossing just $3.3 million against its $10 million budget. Plot In the 1960s, in France, an American couple, former dancer Vanessa and her husband Roland, a successful writer, have been married for 14 years. They drive to a coastal hotel. Roland wants to write a story while staying there. The two are barely on speaking terms; Vanessa is withdrawn and grieving for an unknown reason. Roland appears to drink too much and seems unhappy that Vanessa is no longer interested in him sexually. Roland becomes friendly with the local cafe owner, an older man still grieving his much-loved late wife, but who carries on, cheerfully accepting what life has given him. Vanessa watches a local fisherman who goes out every day on the outgoing tide and returns on the incoming one, catching few fish, but contented. Vanessa and Roland strike up a friendship with an attractive young couple staying in the room next to them. Soon after, they discover that the wall between their two rooms has a disused radiator pipe hole, enabling them to watch the couple in their bedroom talking and having sex. Gradually their experiences at the hotel enable Vanessa and Roland to start patching up their relationship. However, Vanessa attempts a liaison with the young husband in the next room, interrupted violently by Roland, who has been watching through the wall. He bruises the husband, who must later explain to his wife and does so truthfully, seriously damaging the relationship between the young couple. This also triggers a confrontation between Vanessa and Roland, during which he tells her that if she wishes to hurt him, she should just go ahead and hurt him physically. Roland asserts that her seduction of the husband was motivated by his wife's envy of the young couple - particularly of their ability to bear children. Roland physically restrains Vanessa against a wall and makes her speak of herself being barren which they haven't been able to talk about. After a short struggle, Vanessa breaks down and weeps for her loss. Later, Roland explains to the young wife that two miscarriages caused Vanessa's lasting grief, withdrawal and behavior toward her husband. Having finally come to terms with their life together, Vanessa seems able to go on and Roland is able to finish writing a new book. It seems also that the young couple next door may be able to work their way through the episode as well, and come out stronger on the other side. As Vanessa and Roland leave the hotel and drive away, they appear to be reconciled. Cast * Brad Pitt as Roland * Angelina Jolie Pitt as Vanessa * M√©lanie Laurent as L√©a * Niels Arestrup as Michel * Melvil Poupaud as Fran√ßois * Richard Bohringer as Patrice Production In May 2014, it was announced that Angelina Jolie Pitt would co-star with Brad Pitt in a film titled By the Sea, to be written and directed by Jolie. The Hollywood Reporter speculated it would be a relationship drama that Jolie Pitt wrote several years ago, centering on a couple with issues who take a vacation in a last-ditch effort to save their marriage. This was the first cinematic collaboration between the two since Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). Prime Minister Joseph Muscat of Malta confirmed the project, stating that it would be partially filmed at Mƒ°arr ix- Xini. Jolie Pitt has stated that the film \\"at its core, is about grief\\" further noting that the loss of her mother in 2007 caused a great deal of sadness for her. To that end, the movie resembles movies of the 1960s and '70s; Jolie Pitt stated that her mother \\"loved films of that period\\". Christian Berger is the cinematographer; he used mostly natural light throughout filming, while Jon Hutman is the production designer. Principal photography and production began on August 19, 2014, in Gozo, Malta, and ended on November 10, 2014.

The Georgian style building was built circa 1740 and demolished following a 1994 historic survey with addendum and photos dating as late as August 1995. History In 1711, Henry Ridgely III (1690‚Äì1749) patented the 307 acres of land in the Howard district of Anne Arundel County called Broken Land, and in 1719 patented Ridgely's Great Park with his brother in law Thomas Worthington. The Montpelier house was constructed by Colonel Henry Ridgely IV (born 1728) and his wife Ann Dorsey (1730‚Äì1767) circa 1770. His daughter Ann Ridgely married Major Thomas Snowden, building a manor house in Laurel also named Montpelier. Prior to building the house, Ridgely IV raised volunteers in 1752 to fight in the French and Indian War. From 1760 to 1779, Ridgely served as justice to Anne Arundel County. Montpelier was a two-and-a-half-story Georgian style building with a central hall. The brick building rested on a stone foundation with stucco facing, later covered by layers of shingles and siding. A large wooden barn and silo were onsite with the property. The property was later owned by Herbert Wessel. The property was purchased by Hopkins Road Limited Partnership. In 1994, a historic survey was undertaken declaring there was not enough integrity of the site to be historic. Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning rezoned the historic property to PEC (Planned Employment Center). Montpelier was completely demolished to build the MP5 commercial office building adjoining the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab research park. Maple Lawn Developer Jeffery Greenburg did not preserve the historic building or 12-acre site like Laurel's Montpelier. In May 1996 the building was burned, then torn down. Montpelier was one of many historical buildings in the region with valuable real estate that was lost to fire, including Troy Hill (1990), Avondale Mill (1991), St. Mary's College(1997), Ammendale Normal Institute (1998), Phelps Log Cabin ‚Äì moved from North Laurel to Elkridge (2001), and Henryton State Hospital (2007, 2011). A lone indication of the historic site's existence is the road to the facility named Montpelier Road.

The Arab Winter is characterized by the emergence of multiple regional civil wars, mounting regional instability, economic and demographic decline of Arab countries, and ethno-religious sectarian strife. According to a study by the American University of Beirut, by the summer of 2014, the Arab Winter had resulted in nearly a quarter of a million deaths and millions of refugees. Perhaps the most significant event in the Arab Winter was the rise of the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which controlled large swathes of land in the region from 2014 to 2019. In 2020, multiple conflicts are still continuing that might be seen as a result of the Arab Spring.

Definition =Geography= The term \\"Arab Winter\\" refers to the events across Arab League countries in the Mid-East and North Africa, including the Syrian Civil War, the Iraqi insurgency and the following civil war, the Egyptian Crisis, the Libyan Crisis and the Crisis in Yemen. Events referred to as the Arab Winter include those in Egypt that led to the removal of Mohamed Morsi and the seizure of power by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in an anti-Muslim Brotherhood military coup. Political developments, particularly the restoration of authoritarianism and suppression of civil liberties in Egypt since July 3, 2013, have been described as constituting a \\"military winter\\" that functioned in opposition to the goals of the Arab Spring. Various militias and tribes have started fighting in Libya after a breakdown in negotiations. The arenas of Lebanon and Bahrain were also identified as areas of the Arab Winter. Libya was named as a scene of the Arab Winter, together with Syria, by Professor Sean Yom. The Northern Mali conflict was often described as part of the \\"Islamist Winter\\".\\"In Mali AQ achieved to infiltrate and take over Tuareg insurgency. If AQ succeeds to keep the Arab Spring countries destabilized, this will lead to a viral reproduction of Azawad scenario. AQ is the \\"Islamic Winter\\".\\" Political changes which occurred in Tunisia, involving a change in government, as well as an ISIL insurgency, were also indicated by some as a possible \\"heading towards Arab Winter\\". The term was first coined by Chinese professor Zhang Weiwei during a debate with Francis Fukuyama in June 2011. Fukuyama believed the Arab Spring movement would inevitably spread to China, while Zhang predicted, \\"My understanding of the Middle East leads me to conclude that the West should not be too happy. It will bring enormous problems to American interest. It is called 'Arab Spring' for now, and I guess it will soon turn to be the 'winter' for the Middle East.\\" =Beginning date= According to scholars of the University of Warsaw, the Arab Spring fully devolved into the Arab Winter four years after its onset. This view was also supported by Prof. James Y. Simms Jr. in his 2017 opinion article for the Richmond Times. In early 2016, The Economist marked the situation across Arab world countries as \\"worse than ever\\", marking it as the ongoing Arab Winter. Impact =Economic impact= According to the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, as of January 2014, the cost of Arab Winter upheaval across the Arab World was some $800 billion USD. Some 16 million people in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon were expected to require humanitarian assistance in 2014. According to The Economist, Malta has \\"benefited\\" from the Arab Winter, as tourists who might otherwise be in Egypt or Tunisia opt for a safer alternative. =Casualties= According to a study by the American University of Beirut, as of the summer of 2014, the Arab Winter had resulted in nearly a quarter of a million deaths and millions of refugees.

The term is attributed to economist Richard Koo and is related to the debt deflation concept described by economist Irving Fisher. Recent examples include Japan's recession that began in 1990 and the U.S. recession of 2007-2009. Definition A balance sheet recession is a particular type of recession driven by the high levels of private sector debt (i.e., the credit cycle) rather than fluctuations in the business cycle. It is characterized by a change in private sector behavior towards saving (i.e., paying down debt) rather than spending, which slows the economy through a reduction in consumption by households or investment by business. The term balance sheet derives from an accounting equation that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or business is insolvent. Until it regains solvency, the entity will focus on debt repayment. It has been argued that a balance sheet recession essentially is the same phenomenon that the German economist Wilhelm R√∂pke and Austrian School economists in the 1930s denoted as a secondary deflation.Olsen, Andreas Hardhaug. \\"Wilhelm R√∂pke and Richard C. Koo On Secondary Deflations and Balance Sheet Recessions.\\" Economic Affairs 35.2 (2015): 215-224. Causes High levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause a balance sheet recession. This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. Economist Richard C. Koo wrote in 2009 that under ideal conditions, a country's economy should have the household sector as net savers and the corporate sector as net borrowers, with the government budget nearly balanced and net exports near zero. When imbalances develop across these sectors, recession can develop within the country or create pressure for recession in another country. Policy responses are often designed to drive the economy back towards this ideal state of balance. Rather than savings by households being invested by businesses, as is the case under typical economic conditions, the savings remains in the banking system and will not be invested by businesses regardless of the interest rate. A large private sector financial surplus (savings greater than investment), a proverbial \\"hole\\" in the economy, can develop. Paul Krugman wrote in July 2014: \\"The logic of a balance sheet recession is straightforward. Imagine that for whatever reason people have grown careless about both borrowing and lending, so that many families and/or firms have taken on high levels of debt. And suppose that at some point people more or less suddenly realize that these high debt levels are risky. At that point, debtors will face strong pressures from their creditors to ‚Äúdeleverage,‚Äù slashing their spending in an effort to pay down debt. But when many people slash spending at the same time, the result will be a depressed economy. This can turn into a self-reinforcing spiral, as falling incomes make debt seem even less supportable, leading to deeper cuts; but in any case, the overhang of debt can keep the economy depressed for a long time.\\" Martin Wolf wrote in July 2012: \\"Now consider what happens when the asset prices start to fall. Debtors will be unambiguously poorer. Creditors will also feel poorer, since their assets will have deteriorated in quality. Financial intermediaries will become both insolvent and illiquid. There is likely to be a systemic financial crisis. The supply of credit to the private sector will halt. Borrowing will shrink. Investment, particularly in new housing, will collapse. The desired savings of the heavily indebted will rise, as they seek to pay down excessive debt. Creditors, too, will become far more cautious, as they recognise how vulnerable they have become to a wave of bankruptcy among their debtors. The overall effect will be big cutbacks in spending and a deep recession, if not worse. A big financial crisis will accelerate the cuts and turn the recession into a potential depression. That is, of course, what happened in 2008. The effects of the emergence of balance-sheet constraints on spending and borrowing will, in brief, be revealed in the huge financial surpluses in the private sectors of crisis-hit economies.\\" Historical examples =Japan 1990‚Äì2005= For example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \\"Great Recession\\" that began in 1990 was a \\"balance sheet recession\\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have negative equity, meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero interest rates and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type Great Depression, in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy (e.g., central banks lowering key interest rates) was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities, even at near-zero interest rates. In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy. Koo wrote in 2010 that firms may switch from a profit maximization objective to debt minimization until they are solvent (i.e., equity is positive). This may take a long time; when the bubble burst in 1990, corporate demand for funds immediately collapsed, and by 1995, the demand was negative, meaning that Japanese companies were making net pay downs of their debt. The demand remained negative for 10 years, until 2005. This happened despite near zero interest rates. =United States 2007‚Äì2009= U.S. savings and investment; savings greater than investment indicates a large private sector financial surplus, indicative of a balance sheet recession Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2014 that \\"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the financial crisis was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt--that it was a so-called \\"balance sheet recession\\". U.S. household debt rose from approximately 65% GDP in Q1 2000 to 95% by Q1 2008.FRED Database-Household Debt-Retrieved July 2014 This was driven by a housing bubble, which encouraged Americans to take on larger mortgages and use home equity lines of credit to fuel consumption. Mortgage debt rose from $4.9 trillion in Q1 2000 to a peak of $10.7 trillion by Q2 2008. However, it has fallen since as households deleverage, to $9.3 trillion by Q1 2014.FRED Database-Home Mortgage Liability Levels-Retrieved July 2014 While U.S. savings rose significantly during the 2007‚Äì2009 recession, both residential and non- residential investment fell significantly, approximately $560 billion between Q1 2008 and Q4 2009.FRED Database-Residential and Non-Residential Investment- Retrieved July 2014 This moved the private sector financial balance (gross private savings minus gross private domestic investment) from an approximately $200 billion deficit in Q4 2007 to a surplus of $1.4 trillion by Q3 2009. This surplus remained elevated at $720 billion in Q1 2014.FRED Database-Private Sector Financial Surplus-Retrieved July 2014 This illustrates the core issue in a balance sheet recession, that an enormous amount of savings was tied up in the banking system, rather than being invested. The decline in housing prices also caused U.S. household equity to plummet, from a peak of $13.4 trillion in Q1 2006 to $6.1 trillion by Q1 2009, a 54% decline. Household equity began to rise after Q4 2011 and was back to $10.8 trillion by Q1 2014, approximately 80% of its pre-crisis peak level.FRED Database-Household Owner's Equity-Retrieved July 2014 Such a decline in equity shifts household behavior towards deleveraging, as indicated by the reduction in mortgage balances since Q2 2008 described above. A July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by household leverage levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the subprime mortgage crisis. In other words, according to the accounting equation, as the value of their primary asset (homes) fell, mortgage debt initially remained fixed, so equity also fell, causing the ratio of debt to equity (a measure of leverage) to rise. This sudden increase in leverage, causing consumers to shift from spending to paying down debt, can account for a significant decline in employment levels, as employers cut back due to concerns of lower consumer demand. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects. Economist Martin Wolf wrote in 2012 that the financial crisis in the U.S. was a balance sheet recession: \\"The overall story, then, is of an economy driven not by fiscal policy decisions, but by private sector decisions taken for reasons that have nothing to do with the long-run fiscal prospects of the economy. Meanwhile, the government, as a whole, was driven into huge deficit by these private sector decisions. That is exactly what one expects to happen in a huge balance-sheet recession, such as this one.\\" Economists Atif Mian and Amir Sufi wrote in 2014 that: *Historically, severe economic downturns are almost always preceded by a sharp increase in household debt. *U.S. household spending declines were largest in geographic areas with a combination of higher household debt and larger housing price declines. *When housing prices fall, poorer homeowners (with a larger proportion of their net worth in their home) are hit the hardest financially and reduce their consumption relatively more than wealthier households. *Declines in residential investment preceded the recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then non-residential business investment as the recession worsened. Policy response Responses to recessions typically include fiscal stimulus through higher government deficits and monetary stimulus, such as lower interest rates and monetary creation. However, the solvency (net worth) of economic actors is a third important element when dealing with a balance sheet recession, as either asset price declines must be reversed or debt levels reduced, or combination of both. In Krugman's view, balance sheet recessions require private sector debt reduction strategies (e.g., mortgage refinancing) combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt, writing in July 2014: \\"Unlike a financial panic, a balance sheet recession can‚Äôt be cured simply by restoring confidence: no matter how confident they may be feeling, debtors can‚Äôt spend more if their creditors insist they cut back. So offsetting the economic downdraft from a debt overhang requires concrete action, which can in general take two forms: fiscal stimulus and debt relief. That is, the government can step in to spend because the private sector can‚Äôt, and it can also reduce private debts to allow the debtors to spend again. Unfortunately, we did too little of the first and almost none of the second.\\" Krugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained deficit spending when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non- responsive to changes in real interest rates).

It is a contemporary art museum in Baie-Saint-Paul, Quebec, Canada. Origins The museum is located in downtown Baie-Saint-Paul in the heart of the cultural district. The site used to be occupied by Le Laurentien, a cinema that was also used for artistic activities. After World War II (1939‚Äì45) the cinema often put on regional shows and travelling theatrical troupes. In the mid-1980s the Art Centre Corporation (Corporation du Centre d‚Äôart) launched an appeal for a public subscription to build a new exhibition centre for artistic and cultural activities in the Charlevoix region. $100,000 was raised. The cinema was too dilapidated to be preserved, but on January 24, 1992, a new building was opened on the site. The Centre d‚Äôexposition de Baie-St-Paul was designed by noted architect Pierre Thibault. It has large rooms and huge glass panels on the wall facing the church. The museum is partially accessible to the physically disabled. It has meeting facilities and a boutique. The three- story building won first prize for an institutional building in 1992 from the Ordre des architectes du Qu√©bec. History Fran√ßoise Labb√© become general director of the Centre d'exposition and general and artistic director of the Centre d'art de Baie-Saint-Paul in which it was housed, in 1993. Labb√© was made a Knight of the Ordre National du Qu√©bec in 1997. She continued as director of the Centre until her death in 2001. A number of large exhibitions were held during her term as director. Thousands came out for Jean-Paul Riopelle's visit in 1998, which included his celebrated Ice Canoe hung from the ceiling. Painter Marc S√©guin exhibited there in 2001, returning later as well in 2013. The Centre was given museum status in 2008. The announcement was made by then-minister of Culture, Communications and the Status of Women Christine St-Pierre on July 16, 2008. Purpose The goal of the museum is to make known, promote and preserve contemporary art from 1947 to the present. It emphasizes contemporary artists and is open to new movements and forms of expression. It is the only museum in eastern Quebec entirely devoted to contemporary art. It is open year-round. Tours are given in French and English. The museum runs the annual International Symposium of Contemporary Art of Baie-Saint-Paul, which brings together artists from different backgrounds, and encourages interactions with members of the public. Collection The Museum's International Symposium of Contemporary Art brings together artists from around the world to create. Its legacy is a collection of works by over 500 artists.https://symposiumbsp.com/a-propos/ Kathleen Daly (1898‚Äì1994) left over 500 paintings, her own and those of her husband George Pepper (1903‚Äì1962), to the Centre d‚Äôart Baie-Saint-Paul in 1994.

Published in 1965 by Victor Gollancz Ltd (London) and E. P. Dutton & Company (New York), and in six other languages.Hindi, Japanese, Swedish, French, German, and Persian, according to . In the foreword Professor R. C. Zaehner (of All Souls College, Oxford) says Ali Mirdrekvandi was an Iranian peasant who had taught himself to read and write Persian, and then English when British and American troops arrived during World War II. The book's author is the subject of a 2013 documentary by Gholamreza Nematpour. Author The British and American Officer's Book was written by Mirdrekvandi while working at an officers' mess in Tehran during World War II, then given to Hemming (then a British officer), who was mentoring him. Hemming's last contact with Mirdrekvandi was in 1949. At the time of publication the author's history and current circumstances were unknown. Some sources have asserted that Mirdrekvandi was fictional, and the story actually written by Hemming or Zaehner.. Zaehner is said to have been involved in the 1953 coup against Mohammad Mossadegh by the British and American governments. . On publication of the book in 1965 the Iranian press instituted a public search for Mirdrekvandi, characterized as a \\"missing millionaire\\".. The actual book royalties being held for him came to , less costs. His brother, a former classmate, and others who recalled him were found, with the additional information that was he born some time in 1916‚Äì1918 in a village in Lorestan Province in western Iran. According to one sourcePhillip Kreyenbroek, in . he was raised by his grandfather after his parents were \\"taken away by soldiers\\" and never heard of again. This would have been around the time the Pahlavi dynasty had crushed a rebellion by the nomadic Lurs of Lorestan. Young Ali's talents were noted, and he was sent to a school for sons of tribal leaders to \\"not to learn banditry and robbery.\\" He reportedly left school after a dispute with the son of the school director, and was working for a railway when British and Soviet forces entered Iran at the beginning of World War II. It was later discovered that Derikvandi had been living in impoverished circumstances in the town of Borujerd, where he was notable for reading many English language books. He is reported to have written several other stories, which he burned after reading them to fellow homeless people, and to have died on November 26, 1964, just prior to the publication of his book. He had expected his British and American Officer's Book would soon be published but suffered from drug addiction and memory loss. One other unpublished manuscript by Derikvandi, entitled Irradiant, remains in Hemming's archives..  Story  The story is told in somewhat broken English with an often curious choice of words (such as \\"steepy\\" for a steep placeZaehner suggests that Mirdrekvandi's odd language was not so much from ignorance as \\"he just thought his own way of saying things was better.\\" ). Mirdrekvandi's English has been described as \\"often very comic, ... almost always felicitous.\\" The story lacks the sophisticated style of modern writing, being more like the narrative style of ancient ballads. The story has been described as \\"a kind of Pilgrim's Progress\\" as the 82 officers trek across the Milky Way seeking Heaven \\"with General Burke their commander in their front and Gunga Din their servant in their behind.\\" Along the way various stories are told, such as the traveler who, wanting to see how blind people walk, closed his eyes for a section, and so missed some money certain angels had left on the side of the road for him. When they reach the gate of Heaven they find it is guarded by M.P.s (Military Police), who prevent them from entering without Freedom Passes. For these they must go to the Judgement-Field and be judged. Fearing they will be condemned to Hell they become outlaws in a forest on the border of Heaven, giving the Heaven M.P.s much trouble for eight years. Eventually Adam is asked to deal with his children, and he arranges for them to be judged. At the Judgement Field the officers' sins are forgiven on the condition of spending 14 minutes in purgatory. Gunga Din, however, is condemned to Hell for forty earthly years. After suffering bad dreams the officers appeal on his behalf. The story ends with the Children of Man agitating for changes in how Heaven and Hell are run.  Notes   Sources  * Edited and introduction by John Hemming, foreword by Professor R. C. Zaehner.

The entire project cost US$904.10 million, of which US$320 million was provided by the World Bank. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir was formed with the creation of the Tongbai Lower Dam on the Baizhang River. The Tongbai Upper Reservoir, which already existed before construction began, is in an adjacent valley above the east side of the lower reservoir on Tongbai Creek. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Tongbai Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. The power station is operated by Shenergy Company. The lower reservoir is created by a tall and long concrete-face rock-fill dam on the Baizhang River. It can hold up to of water of which can be used for power generation.

His research fields include historical linguistics, bilingualism, Slavic linguistics, creole linguistics, Romani (Gypsy) and Jewish languages. Wexler is known in Yiddish linguistics mainly for his hypothesis that Eastern Yiddish is ultimately derived from Judaeo-Slavic from a genetic-linguistic perspective, a hypothesis that has been widely rejected by other Yiddish and Germanic linguistsRose Kaplan, Tablet (magazine)26 April 2016. and geneticists. His linguistic approach is considered inconsistent with conventional and universal methods of historical linguistics, such as the comparative method. These standard linguistic approaches demonstrate that both Eastern and Western Yiddish are descended from a Middle High German dialect with components of Aramaic and Hebrew vocabulary, which underwent the same regular sound changes as those undergone by the German components. Wexler asserts that the Yiddish language structure provides evidence that Jews had \\"intimate contact\\" with early Slavs in the German and Bohemian lands as early as the 9th century.Paul Wexler (1992), \\"From Serb Lands to Sorb Lands,\\" in The Balkan Substratum of Yiddish: A Reassessment of the Unique Romance and Greek Components, Harrassowitz Verlag, 1992, p. 111 Biography Wexler was born and raised in the United States, earned his B.A. at Yale University in 1960, his M.A. at Columbia University in 1962 and his Ph.D. at Columbia University in 1967. He moved to Israel in 1969. He did his basic training in the IDF in 1974.Philologos, 'The Origins of Yiddish, Part Dray,' The Forward20 July 2014. Hypotheses on the origins of Jewish languages Wexler's hypotheses are based on analyses of numerous Jewish languages and introduce creolization as a factor in the formation of many of them. Other than linguistic analysis, he separates Jewish cultural areas into Judeo-Greek, Judeo-Romance, Judeo- Germanic, Judeo-Turkic, Judeo-Tat, Judaeo-Georgian, Judeo-Arabic and Judeo- Slavic. While he acknowledges that many Jewish languages have a Hebrew substratum,Bernard Spolsky, The Languages of the Jews: A Sociolinguistic History, Cambridge University Press 2014 p.184. Wexler's hypothesis holds that these languages were derived from various proselyte groups who retained the grammar of their old non-Jewish languages, while relexifying them through the extensive adoption of new vocabularies.Paul Wexler, Two-tiered Relexification in Yiddish: Jews, Sorbs, Khazars, and the Kiev-Polessian, Walter de Gruyter 2002 pp.9,55-56.71. Many of the languages he has posited as ancestral to various Jewish languages lack empirical evidence for their existence, and cannot be deduced using methods that are standard in the field of linguistics. There are 3 distinct theories regarding the origin of Yiddish, and Wexler's approach differs radically with the two main theories positing a Western Rhineland origin or a Bavarian/Czech genesis, and does so by breaking the genetic link between the Slavic countries and those Jews who lived in medieval Germany.Alexander Beider, Origins of Yiddish Dialects, Oxford University Press, 2015 p.526. Wexler argues that Yiddish began as two distinct languages: Judeo-French (Western Yiddish) and a Judeo-Sorbian dialect spoken in eastern Germany. The former died out while the latter formed the basis for the later Yiddish language.Deborah Hertz, 'Contacts and Relations in the Pre- Emancipation Period: A Comment,' in R. Po-Chia Hsia, Hartmut Lehmann, (eds.) In and Out of the Ghetto: Jewish-Gentile Relations in Late Medieval and Early Modern Germany, Cambridge University Press, 2002 pp.151-160 p.155.Paul Wexler, 'Languages in Contact: The Case of Rotwelsch and the Two Yiddishes,' R. Po- Chia Hsia, Hartmut Lehmann, (eds.) In and Out of the Ghetto: Jewish-Gentile Relations in Late Medieval and Early Modern Germany,] Cambridge University Press, 2002 pp.109-12. Eastern Yiddish, he hypothesizes, is derived from the intersection of Sorbian Jews who spoke Yiddish and Slavic speaking descendants of the Khazars. He hypothesizes this second relexification of Eastern Yiddish took place in the 15th century, at which time the descendants of the Khazars no longer spoke a Turkic language but rather a mixed Slavo-Turkic. In 1990, Wexler published a book titled The Schizoid Nature of Modern Hebrew: A Slavic Language in Search of a Semitic Past in which he argued that Modern Hebrew is not a direct continuation of the Hebrew language, but rather a Slavic language. He argued that Modern Hebrew was simply Yiddish relexified to Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew, and based on his arguments that Yiddish is a Slavic language derived from Sorbian, he argued that Modern Hebrew can be considered a Slavic language.Wexler, Paul: The Schizoid Nature of Modern Hebrew: A Slavic Language in Search of a Semitic Past (1990) Wexler considers it possible that the Slavicized descendants of the Khazars immigrated north and westward, causing some Eastern Slavic terms for Jewish holidays to becoming part of Western Slavic. Wexler states that his hypothesis does not require Yiddish to contain a significant Turkic substratum. Wexler rejects the theory that the differences between Eastern and Western Yiddish were caused by the former's greater exposure to Slavic, instead viewing the two dialects as two largely separate languages. In his 1993 book he stated that Ashkenazi Jews could be considered ethnically Slavic. He asserts that the Ashkenazi are not of Mediterranean origin. Considering the logical outcome of his linguistic hypotheses to be that Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of Iranian, Turkic, and Slavic proselytes. He has also applied his linguistic hypotheses to Sephardic Jews suggesting similarly that they are in fact also of non-Jewish origin, originating from Berber proselytes rather than from Spain.Paul Wexler, The Non-Jewish Origins of the Sephardic Jews, SUNY Press 2012. Herbert Paper in his 1995 paper on two of Wexler books rejects two of Wexler‚Äôs hypotheses: first, that Yiddish is derived from an undiscovered Judeo-Sorbian language and secondly that Modern Hebrew is in fact a Slavic language. He prefers to describe languages Max Weinreich described as Eastern and Western Knaanic as, rather, Judeo-Slavic.Paul Wexler, Explorations in Judeo-Slavic Linguistics, BRILL 1987 p.x. In more recent work, Wexler has proposed three origins of Yiddish, by dividing it into two distinct languages: he regards Western Yiddish as a Judaized German; Eastern Yiddish is interpreted as developing from Judeo-Slavic relexified to High German and then again to Yiddish. He has also argued however that that eastern Yiddish is a relexification of Judeo- Turkic and linked to the Khazars and Karaites. Wexler's methodology is considered inconsistent with the accepted methods of historical linguistics. Since the conventional comparative method, used throughout the field of historical linguistics, demonstrates that Yiddish is descended from Old High German, and furthermore that the dialects of both Western and Eastern Yiddish can be reliably traced back to a Proto-Yiddish phonology,Katz, Dovid. Methodology in Yiddish Historical Linguistics, in Danielle Buschinger & Roy Rosenstein (eds), Jewish Identity and Comparative Studies [Festschrift for Astrid Starck-Adler], Centre d‚Äô√âtudes M√©di√©vales de Picardie: Amiens 2019, pp. 1-12., 2019.‚ÄúThe Proto Dialectology of Ashkenaz‚Äù in Dovid Katz (ed), Origins of the Yiddish Language, Pergamon: Oxford, 47-60; http://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1987.pdf. his beliefs about the origin of Eastern Yiddish are considered to be \\"in the realm of unsupported speculation\\" and marginal within the field of linguistics.Pitfalls of the Geographic Population Structure (GPS) Approach Applied to Human Genetic History: A Case Study of Ashkenazi Jews Paul Wexler's hypotheses on both Yiddish and the Turkic-Iranian-Khazar origins have been criticized harshly by many other specialists in the field, the majority of whom reject them. Simon Neuberg rebuffs the relexification hypothesis saying that it \\"seems more of a marketing trick.\\" Steffen Krogh also disagrees with Wexler. Alexander Beider likewise states: \\"Sometimes I even wonder if he himself believes in what he writes. If he does not believe, but merely wants to provoke, his writings of the last 20 years are oriented just to prove that Jews are not Jews. In this case, there is nothing to discuss.\\" In 2016, Wexler and geneticist Eran Elhaik co-authored a study that analyzed the geographical origin of Yiddish speakers using a method called Geographic Population Structure (GPS) to analyze their DNA. They claimed that the DNA has originated in Northeastern Turkey in four villages whose names were, they argued, derived from the word \\"Ashkenaz.\\" The predicted location was also on the hub of Silk Road routes and close to the Khazarian Empire, as predicted by Wexler and in contrast with the predictions of the Rhineland hypothesis. The authors argue that this is where a non- Germanic \\"pre-Yiddish\\" was developed as an undocumented language for trade and that with the Judaization of Slavs it acquired its alleged Slavic component. This argument has been criticized by both geneticists and linguists, who argue that there are serious methodological flaws in its linguistic and genetic components. In addition to conventional linguistic approaches demonstrating that Yiddish is descended from Old High German, the Geographic Population Structure (GPS) tool is not suitable \\"for admixed populations and for tracing ancestry up to 1,000 years before present, as its authors have previously claimed.\\" Controversy In 1988, Wexler was suspected by some Yiddish scholars of having written, under the Ukrainian pseudonym Pavlo Slobodjans‚Äôkyj, a harshly-worded review in the journal Language of their work contained in the volume \\"Origins of the Yiddish Language\\".1988\\\\. Review of \\"Origins of the Yiddish Language\\". Language 64:761-766. While criticising others, the writer excluded Wexler's work, contained in the same volume, from criticism. After strong protests were raised at the putative fraud by one of the editors in particular, Dovid Katz, and evidence suggested that the review had all the hallmarks of Wexler's polemical style and that the submission had been sent from the address of one of Wexler's relatives. The journal where it was published, Language, later published an \\"apology\\" and retracted the review.199\\\\. \\"Apology\\".

History In 1616, the British East India Company appointed Terry as one of its fleet chaplains for a trip to India. While en route in the Indian Ocean, the fleet engaged and destroyed a Portuguese carrack. Terry later described this battle in his work, A Voyage to East-India. When Terry arrived in India, Sir Thomas Row, the English ambassador, asked Terry to become the new chaplain for the English embassy. Terry's predecessor had just recently died. Terry spent the next two and half years with Row as they followed the Mogul court around what is today Gujarat, India and Bihar, India. After returning to England, Terry served as rector of the Church at Great Greenford, in Middlesex, England until his death in 1660. Published work Terry wrote A Voyage to East-India as an expanded version of a manuscript that was first published in Purchas his Pilgrimes in 1625. What distinguished Voyage was Terry's detailed descriptions of the different ethnic groups in the region, including their cultures, languages, and religious beliefs. Terry was one of the first writers to describe Indian-style vegetarianism to Early Modern England. Given that Terry only visited two regions of the Indian Subcontinent, much of his commentary was probably based on other research.

Much of its popularity stems from the low levels of care needed; the jade plant requires little water and can survive in most indoor conditions. It is sometimes referred to as the money tree; however, Pachira aquatica also has this nickname.Urs Eggli (ed.): Succulent Encyclopedia. Crassulaceae (thick-leafed plants) . Eugen Ulmer, Stuttgart 2003, , p 66 .  Description  Blooming specimens. The jade plant is an evergreen with thick branches. It has thick, shiny, smooth leaves that grow in opposing pairs along the branches. Leaves are a rich jade green, although some may appear to be more of a yellow-green. Some varieties may develop a red tinge on the edges of leaves when exposed to high levels of sunlight. New stem growth is the same colour and texture as the leaves, becoming woody and brown with age. It grows as an upright, rounded, thick- stemmed, strongly branched shrub and reaches stature heights of up to 2.5 metres. The base is usually sparsely branched. Sometimes a single main trunk of up to 6 centimetres in diameter is formed. The succulent shoots are gray- green. The bark of older branches peels off in horizontal, brownish stripes. The oppositely arranged, ascending to spreading, green leaves are stalked with up to 5 millimetres short. The fleshy, bare, obovate, wedge-shaped leaf blade is 3 to 9 centimetres long and 1.8 to 4 centimetres wide. The sharp-edged leaf margins are often reddish. Numerous varieties and cultivars have been selected, of which C. ovata 'Hummel's Sunset' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Inflorescence= Although becoming brown and appearing woody with age, stems never become true lignified tissue, remaining succulent and fleshy throughout the plant's life. Under the right conditions, they may produce small white or pink, star-like shaped flowers in winter. The terminal inflorescence is a top round thyrsus with numerous dichasia. It has a length and a diameter of about 5 centimetres. The inflorescence stem has a length of 15 to 18 millimetres and a diameter of 2 millimetres. The flower stalks are 5 millimetres long.Botanical Society and Exchange Club of the British Isles 1917 . 1917, p. 617. The sweet-scented, hermaphroditic flowers have radial symmetry and double perianths. The five sepals, each about 2 millimetres long, are fused to one another at the base. The pink or white flower crown is star-shaped and has a diameter of about 15 millimetres. Its lanceolate petals are 7 millimetres long and 2.5 millimetres wide. The stamens have a length of 5 millimetres. The combination of shorter days, cold nights and lack of water for several weeks will produce flowering around the beginning of winter.  Cultivation  As an indoor bonsai As a succulent, Crassula ovata requires little water in the summer and even less in the winter. It is susceptible to overwatering, especially during the cold season. Watering excessively can cause leaf fall and root rot. On the other hand, a lack of water can also damage it. It should be grown in a porous substrate with good drainage, which will vary depending on the climate it is grown in. It requires about 4‚Äì6 hours of direct sun or medium shade exposures with bright light. In regions of mild weather it can withstand some light frost, provided that the substrate is kept dry.Gibbs Russell, GE, WGM Welman, E. Retief, KL Immelman, G. Germishuizen, BJ Pienaar, M. Van Wyk & A. Nicholas. 1987. List of species of southern African plants. Mem. Bot. Surv. S. Africa 2 (1‚Äì2): 1‚Äì152 (pt. 1), 1‚Äì270 (pt. 2). C. ovata may display a red tinge around its leaves when grown with bright sunlight. In more extreme cases, the green colour of the plant is lost and can be replaced by yellow. This is caused by the jade plant making pigments such as carotenoids to protect from harsh sunlight and ultraviolet rays. The plant also flowers in the wintertime, particularly during a cooler, darker, dry spell. C. ovata is sometimes attacked by mealybugs, a common nuisance of the succulents. The jade plant is well known for its bonsai capabilities, since it forms a bonsai very easily when pruning is done correctly. Many who learn bonsai begin with a jade plant, since they are durable, easy to put through the bonsai process, and attractive. = Propagation = The jade plant is also known for its ease of propagation, which can be carried out with clippings or even stray leaves which fall from the plant. Jade plants may readily be propagated from both with success rates higher than with cuttings. In the wild, vegetative propagation is the jade plant's main method of reproduction. Branches regularly fall off wild jade plants, and these branches may root and form new plants. Like many succulents, jade plants can be propagated from just the swollen leaves which grow in pairs on the stems. While propagation methods may vary, most follow similar steps. Typically, the wounds on the leaves are left to dry and callus over. Then, the leaves are placed in or on soil. Roots begin to grow on severed leaves about four weeks after being removed from the stem. Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity affect the speed at which the roots and new plants develop. Foliage usually appears soon after new roots have formed.MD, MD and PhD ( pref. Lewis R. Goldfrank), Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants, Second Edition , Springer,2007, 2 th ed. , XVIII-340 p. , 1 vol. : ill. ; 21 cm ( , , and ) , p. 137. Parasites and diseases Scale insects are common pests of Crassula ovata and can cause deformation of the plant during growth. An infestation can be eliminated by killing each insect with a cotton bud or brush that has been soaked in rubbing alcohol. This process is repeated daily until all mealybugs have been killed, as well as new insects that may still hatch after the mealybugs living on the plant have been killed. Aphids are also common pests, but they tend to infest the stems of flowers. Spider mites can also cause problems. Exposure to sap or leaves can cause dermatitis in humans.Botanical Society and Exchange Club of the British Isles 1917 . 1917, p. 617. Toxicity The jade plant is toxic to horses,https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal- poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants/jade-plant and dogs and cats, as well as mildly toxic to humans, in some cases, with skin contact.https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.hunker.com/12245691/are-jade- plants-poisonous In this respect it differs greatly, possibly dangerously, from Portulacaria, which is edible to humans and other animals.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub.

Fu is known as the first (and last) female Zhuangyuan in Chinese history (though her examinations were under the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, not the Qing dynasty). Career The historical record on Fu Shanxiang is brief and unclear, but scholars agree on the outlines. She was a daughter of the scholar Fu Qizheng, a native of Nanjing, who was orphaned at an early age. The rebel armies of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom took control of the city in 1853, and proclaimed revolutionary social policies, including the equality of women. They arranged the first examinations for women in the history of China. The exam was held on January 13, 1853, the birthday of the Taiping Heavenly King, Hong Xiuquan. Fu achieved the highest score, earning her the title Zhuangyuan, the first and only time in Chinese history that the honor had been (allowed to) and earned by a woman. After her success, no more examinations for women were held. Fu was appointed Chancelloress in the court of Yang Xiuqing, the East King (Dong Wang), where she dealt with correspondence and official papers. Since Yang was illiterate, having been orphaned at an early age and receiving no schooling, Fu Shanxiang read documents aloud to him. She issued pardons in Yang's name for many who had broken the laws against opium and alcohol. However, at one point she spoke disrespectfully to Yang, and may have been smoking tobacco or using alcohol, each of which was in itself a capital offense under the puritanical Taiping codes. At Yang's request, the Heavenly King, Hong Xiuquan, issued \\"An Edict Condemning A Chancelloress,\\" which noted that while drunk, Fu had insulted the East King and shown extreme disrespect. Alcohol was forbidden in the Taiping Kingdom, therefore her punishment should have been immediate decapitation. But Hong took into account her record of good service and that she was under the influence of alcohol when she lost control of her words (the nature of the words is not indicated). Hong decreed that the \\"lightest punishment will be given,\\" namely that Fu should wear the cangue on seven Sabbath days, after which she could regain office and redeem herself. Fu then wrote a letter of penitence in what she called \\"extreme fear of her unpardonable crime.\\" She thanked Yang, the Dong Wang, for his role in getting her such light punishment: ::In drunken carelessness, by a slip of the tongue I offended the [Dong Wang]. Were the [Dong Wang] to confer death upon this maidservant, how could she begrudge him her death? But now, by an excessive expression of mercy, execution has not been imposed; instead I only have been made to wear the cangue as a display of light punishment.... Yet the life of an ant is not safe night or day. On my part, as a woman, I have had extraordinary fortune in having been given administrative authority over women and having risen to heights in the feminine world. Already gloriously fortunate to the extreme, what regrets would I have in death? ... With regret I look back to your kind regard without which I can no longer sustain myself in this world.... The pair of gold bracelets which Your Majesty kindly gave me, I, at the brink of death, return by messenger to you, wrapped in some red gauze which I myself have worn.... If your Highness should one day think of my humble service, when you see this it will be like seeing me, your maidservant. (\\"Letter from A Chancelloress to the Tung Wang [Dong Wang],\\" (n.d.) ) Fu resumed her service, taking special responsibilities for women's hostels. In March 1854, Yang, delivering his edicts as the word of God, declared that the heroes of the Chinese past were to be respected and certain core values maintained. His orders responded to the unease of many people in newly occupied areas who did not agree with Hong Xiuquan's radical program of attacking tradition. A rift opened between Yang and Hong. Because he respected her knowledge of the classics, Yang ordered Fu to write an edict explaining why the heroes of former times should in fact be honored. She earned Yang's praise when she wrote :Heroes are those who, by the grace of the Heavenly Father [that is, Jehovah], have been inspired by the spirit and therefore are born intelligent and become discreet and decent when they grow older. They honor filial piety at home and practise loyalty and patriotism when they are in society.... when they die, their heroic exploits will be transmitted in history. They enjoy eternal glory in having their meritorious achievement and deeds recorded in books which, as ordained by the Heavenly Father, should never be destroyed. Yang Xiuqing was assassinated in September, 1856, presumably on Hong's orders, and thousands of his followers killed.Teng Ssu- yu, \\"Yang Hsiu-ch'ing,\\" in , pp. 887-888. Fu was not killed in this slaughter, but committed suicide in 1864 by poison when the emperor's forces began recapturing Nanjing. In popular culture Fu Shanxiang caught the attention of later playwrights and novelists. She is presented in the 1943 play Tianguo chunqiu by Yang Hansheng as having a romance with Yang Xiuqing leading to a tragic conclusion because of jealousy with Hong Xuanjiao, sister of Hong Xiuquan. This incident also appears in the 2000 CCTV series, The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and her fate is depicted in a section of Xu Xaobin's 1998 novel, Yu she, translated as Feathered Serpent.

He wrote numerous books which became standard texts for designers and architects.  Biography  Goldsmith was born in Newark, Nottinghamshire on 11 December 1932. He was educated at Abbotsholme school, Staffordshire, and read architecture at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, completing his qualification at the Bartlett School, University College London, in 1956. He contracted Polio in that same year and was paralysed down the right hand side of his body for the rest of his life.

After this development Goldsmith realised the impact this can have on all users, such as mothers with pushchairs. This led to his interest in Universal principles of design. = Universal design = Goldsmith worked with Gordon Ricketts, the secretary of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Together they developed the idea behind Designing for the Disabled which was a new concept within the UK. This resulted in the book Designing for the Disabled (1963), which is an architectural planning manual on access for disabled people to facilities and buildings. He later revised this book after retirement. In his later life he further developed the idea of Universal Design in a book of the same title.

The only indication stems from legends about fairies who were closely related to ancient nymphs.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Traƒçki hram kod vrela, page 114 This ancient shrine was closed in 392, just before the founding of the first Christian monastery dedicated to St. Demetrius, in whose interior were placed reliquiae from the old church (marble icons of a nymph and a Thracian horseman). Temples dedicated to the sun god Mitras were placed close to main roads and sources of water. This was characteristic for the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, especially in the Poni≈°avlje district. This is based on the presence of two bequeath altars, one in Divljana and another in village of Osmakova, and of two relief icons, one in village Ragode≈° and another in village of Rasnica, within 20 km (12 miles).O nalazima sa lit.

Gaguliƒá, Opis manastira Sv. Velikomuƒçenika Dimitrija u Divljani, Language: Serbian, rukopis, Ni≈°, 1957. =Origin of the name of the monastery= The name Divljana is derived from Latin Divus, meaning \\"divine\\" or \\"god\\". Professor S. Petroviƒá mentions toponyms with the base and root words: giant (Ser. –¥–∏–≤) and wild (Ser. –î–∏–≤—ò–∏). Giants were part of Serbian pre-Christian mythology. The Serbian word div (Ser. –¥–∏–≤), itself was derived from the word dievo, and related words were used in Indo-European languages for naming gods: Indian Deva, Old-Persian Daeva or Divus, and Latin Deus.S. Petroviƒá, Srpska mitologija 1, Ni≈°, 1999, page 106 However, it is obvious that the present name Divljana comes from the Latin word Divian, which means \\"land of the gods\\" (sr. –ë–æ–≥–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∞).Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Traƒçki hram kod vrela, page 113, paragraph 3-4 =Early Christian church= The first church at this location was an early Christian three-nave basilica. This can be seen from the period of its construction, from archaeological research and by comparison with other churches of the same type in the area. Christian churches in Remesiana from that era were generally oriented east-west with the altar on the east side, where the dimensions were . Above the main entrance stood a porch which would have been borne by two massive pillars with bases and capitals. On the capitals, there were usually engravings of the early Christian sign of the cross and the letter omega. The floors and wall paneling were made of marble.ƒê. Mano-Zisi, Lj. Popoviƒá, Bela Palanke (Remeziana) arheolo≈°ka iskopavanja, Starinar 9-10, Language: Serbian, 1958-1959, Belgrade, page 98-99; S. Gu≈°iƒá, Urbanizam Remeziane od I do IV veka, Saop≈°tenja, Language:Serbian, XIX, 1987, Belgrade, page 21-35 The Church of St. Demetrius in Divljana had dimensions of . The former church in Divljana was very similar to the present-day church which was almost the same size, with the same foundation and at the same location, except that it had a larger western portal. The present church was built in the Romanesque and Renaissance styles. The church had a two-story roof in combination with west facade and thus created the impression of a three-nave church. Here there is no dome but its decorations include 124 blind arcades, pilaster strips and trefoil.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Arhitektura crkve, page 122 The founder of this church was Nicetas of Remesiana (338‚Äì420). It was built between 392 and 395. Nicetas is well known by his achievements throughout the Roman Empire, where he was an active missionary and writer.≈Ω. Jociƒá, Niketa iz Rameziane, Language: Serbian, p. 196 He held the position of bishop in Remesiana (366‚Äì420), leaving many of the oldest churches and monasteries in the area. His importance is reflected by the fact that other early monasteries were established at the time: in Milan between 374 and 379 by Bishop Ambrose, in Tugasta in 398 by St. Augustine, and in Marseille in 415 by John Cassian.A. Francen, nav. delo, page 88; ≈Ω. Jociƒá, nav. delo, Language: Serbian, page 190 However, at the time when the Divljana Monastery was created, the Roman Empire suffered frequent incursions by the Goths across the Danube, and the monastery was frequently destroyed. In these times, bishop Nicetas, who was in touch with senior state and church officials, did his utmost to protect Christianity in the region.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Ranohri≈°ƒáanska crkva, page 119, 2. paragraph Based on research undertaken by M. Kostiƒá, it is no coincidence that the monastery was located where it stands. Choosing a place to build a monastery dedicated to St. Demetrios was not only due to its extraordinary natural environment, but also because it is very close to the Divljana hot springs.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Traƒçki hram kod vrela, page 112 Like other hot springs, these were known for their medicinal composition and their sacred connotations, but over time there were changes to the composition of the water due to demineralization. In the Middle Ages, the function of the holy place resulted in the Divljana monastery.M. Kostiƒá, Turistiƒçku centar Divljana, Language: Serbian, glasnik SGD, LII, 2, Belgrade, 1972., page 137 The role of the place \\"Diviana\\" becomes clearer when the Thracian Triballi tribe from Poni≈°avljeOp≈°irno o Tribalima u Poni≈°avlju, Language: Serbian, ≈Ω. Jociƒá, n.d. page 175-186 began to worship at hot springs and rivers, especially in spas and other sources of healing waters. They developed a cult of the gods of health and vitality. All this led to the founding of a Christian monastery.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Traƒçki hram kod vrela, page 113 After the closing of the pagan temple in 392, the monastery was built on the same site between 392 and 395, at a time when Christianity had already been established as the official religion in the Roman Empire. Based on archaeological research, it remains to be proven whether the original church of the Divljana monastery was on the same site as the medieval church.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Izbor mesta i patrona, page 120 The selection of the Thessaloniki miracle worker St. Demetrius as patron of the monastery was by the Bishop Niketa, indicating the rapid development and expansion of the worship of this saint in Thessaloniki. Thessaloniki had been the capital of the prefecture of Illyria, to which Remesiana (Bela Palanka) belonged at the end of the 4th century. It is not known exactly when the first church, dedicated to St Demetrius, was built, but prefect Leontius built a large basilica in Thessaloniki, and later, in 412, he built another in the Sirmium. Niketa had multiple connections with Thessaloniki, and some of these connections were with his master chief of the church with whom he discussed everything; another connection was that he traveled by boat from Thessaloniki to east and west, and also met with the Emperor Theodosius.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Izbor mesta i patrona, page 121 All this becomes clearer from the fact that Thessaloniki for Niketa was the same as for St. Sava 800 years later.≈Ω. Jociƒá, nav. delo, Language: Serbian, page 196-197 =The main temple of Middle Poni≈°avlje= Hostel in Divljana monastery Divljana monastery survived the fall of the Roman Empire, and around it there was a permanent settlement of pagan Slavs in the Poni≈°avlje district around 614. But soon after that, Christian life on that location disappeared for the next two centuries, clearly confirming the renewal and reaffirmation of worship in 870 when re-Christianization began. The re-opening of dioceses and parishes was undertaken by the Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. All shrines that were in evidence as Christian churches were restored. Since Remesiana had been destroyed, Divljana monastery became a center of this region for an extended period, as can be seen from a charter by Emperor Basil II from 1019.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Glavni hram srednjeg Poni≈°avlja, page 114 The temple has survived much rebuilding. In one reconstruction, elements in the Byzantine style were taken. This region was the center of Christianity in Poni≈°avlje until the Turks arrived, leading to its destruction and abandonment. Before the devastation, the monastery owned of land as well as Prnjavor (an earlier name for the village of Divljana) which covered another .Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Glavni hram srednjeg Poni≈°avlja, page 125, 1. paragraph One of the final demolitions occurred in 1386, during the great military campaign of the Turks at Ni≈°, when they destroyed and burned the whole Poni≈°avlje district, including towns, villages and monasteries. In that military campaign, the Turks moved from Sofia to Ni≈°, under the leadership of Sultan Murad, who later was killed in Kosovo.Pirotski zbornik , Language: Serbian, 2004/2005, no. 29-30, UDK 902(497.11), Glavni hram srednjeg Poni≈°avlja, page 125, 2. paragraph Another demolition took place in 1389 with the battle of Kosovo, leading to heavy battles in the Pirot region. The church was restored in 1395 and stood until 1902 when it was destroyed for the last time. Thereafter came the present church. Based on travel writer Stephan Gerlach's notes in 1578, five monks in the monastery held school there.P. Matkoviƒá, Putovanje po Balkanskom poluotoku, Language: Serbian, page 85-86 From the Turkish cadastral census of 1595, we see that Divljana monastery is not new and that means that the monastery had already come under Turkish rule from 1574, requiring payment of 300 groat in tax to the Turkish authority.R. Triƒçkoviƒá, Manastiri u okolini Pirota, Language: Serbian, page 85-86 Also, from the stone monument from 1670, we learn of Stojan Vuja from Suraƒçevo.K. Kostiƒá, Istorija Pirota, Language: Serbian, Pirot, 1973, page 53 One oktoih was repaired in 1714. The same sources reveal that in 1723, a fair was held in the name of Mary (mother of Jesus).≈Ω. Jociƒá, Manastirske ≈°kole, Language: Serbian, page 131 In 1719, the Austrian diplomat K.

Kostiƒá, nav. delo, Language: Serbian, page 54 Before the battle of ƒåegar, the monastery was burned during the First Serbian Uprising in 1809. Thereafter, the monastery library and whole church interior were reconstructed, and the sponsor of this work, Thracian guild from Pirot, donated an icon of St. Spyridon in 1820.Icon with size 57—Ö70cm with inscription: ‚ÄûPomeni g(ospo)di esnav traƒçki 1820‚Äú, Language: Serbian, now in monastery archives In 1873, the narthex was demolished, and in 1876‚Äì77 the monastery quarters were burnt with the fire reaching the library and destroying two parchment manuscripts.F Kanic, Srbija II, Language: Serbian, Belgrade, 1985, page 225; ≈Ω. Jociƒá, Biblioteke Divljanskog manastira, Language: Serbian, Pirotski zbornik no.27-28, Pirot, 2002, page 189,197. After the liberation from the Turks in 1878, it was decided a new church should be built with construction beginning in 1902 and ending in 1908. In 1902, the nave was demolished and after that the church was completed as it stands today. The author of the new church was the architect Milorad Rudiviƒá. During the Bulgarian occupation between 1915 and 1916, Bulgarians looted and vandalized the monastery, which was the last seen of an old record which told of how St. Sava spent a time at the monsatery. After the liberation and the October Revolution, Russian nuns, doctors and officers escaped in large numbers, and some of them came to Divljana monastery. They painted and arranged the new temple, and in 1933, they built a winter church dedicated to Sarov miracle worker St. Seraphim. They lived in the monastery until the beginning of World War II, when the remains of a sorority of Serbian nuns moved into the monastery. After the war, all property was revoked from the monastery, and a church dedicated to St Demetrius was restored; the monastery quarters were demolished and on its foundation a new one was built in 2005. Architects D. Milutinoviƒá and M. Valtroviƒá made color illustrations and measured drawings of the church, immediately after liberation from the Turks in 1878. After that, the monastery was visited by M. Miliceviƒá between 1878 and 1882,M. Miliƒáeviƒá, Kraljevina Srbija, Language: Serbian, page 180 F. Kanic in 1889,F.

The quarter is characterised by insurance companies and other office buildings, but is also an inner city residential area. The name derives from two major streets: Warmb√ºchenstra√üe und Warmb√ºchenkamp.  Layout  Warmb√ºchenviertel is bounded by the streets Schiffgraben, Marienstra√üe and Berliner Allee, while the northern limit is formed by the railway. The quarter's main road is Lavesstra√üe.  History  Headquarters of the charity Ahlers Pro Arte - one of the oldest buildings in Warmb√ºchenviertel. Lavesplatz Buildings on Warmb√ºchenkamp Road Towards the end of the 1840s, the Hanover city limit was Schiffgraben street, a former canal. At the time Warmb√ºchenviertel was an extramural agricultural area and known as Kirchwende (Church Corner), which is where Kirchwender Stra√üe gets its name from. Here smallholders cultivated vegetables to sell in the market. The nearest city gate was the Aegidientor, from which the modern day Marienstra√üe ran eastwards, serving as the way to market. The Gartenkirche stood within Warmb√ºchenviertel, on Marienstra√üe from 1746. Its cemetery was the Gartenfriedhof, where Charlotte Kestner was buried, among others. One of the oldest houses in Warmb√ºchenviertel is the building which is now the headquarters of the charity \\"Ahlers Pro Arte\\". It was once owned by the Alfeld textile manufacturer Ahlers and was also the contemporary location of the kestnergesellschaft gallery. Despite popular protest, a building designed by Hermann Schaedtler was demolished in 2008. It was a monumental building with a round dome (destroyed in the Second World War), which was the original headquarters of the health insurer AOK. The medical supplier √Ñrzteversorgung Sachsen-Anhalt is currently (as of October 2009) building a luxury residential complex with almost 100 apartments on the site. It will be named \\"Warmb√ºchenviertel\\" after the quarter.  Civic engagement  The Anliegerinitiative Lavesstra√üe/Warmb√ºchenviertel (Lavesstra√üe/Warmb√ºchenviertel Neighbourhood Organisation) was established in February 2001, to which businesses and homeowners belong. They act together sporadically to influence developments in the quarter.Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung / Stadt-Anzeiger, 1 March 2001: \\"Anlieger des Warmb√ºchenviertels haben die Anwohnerinitiative Lavesstra√üe gegr√ºndet\\" Among other things, they blocked the construction of a hotel (on the current location of the firefighters' association). The Anliegerinitiative also made strong submissions in favour of the conversion of the intersection of Warmb√ºchenstra√üe and Dieterichsstra√üe with Lavesstra√üe. This resulted in the Lavesplatz (Laves Plaza), which was opened on 7 September 2007 and bears the name of the nineteenth century Hanoverian court architect Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves.Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung / Stadt-Anzeiger, 13 September 2007, \\"Die Anwohner im Warmb√ºchenviertel er√∂ffnen nach sechs Jahren W√ºnschen und Planen den \\"Lavesplatz\\"\\" The Anliegerinitiative also supported the re-establishment of an active merchants' association in Warmb√ºchenviertel, with the help of the city council. This resulted in the establishment of \\"Integrativen Stadtteilarbeit,\\" an organisation which is externally moderated by the Hanoverian company KoriS. Since 2006, the organisation has been concerned with the revival of Lavesstra√üe as a High Street.

Boron fiber manifests a combination of high strength and high elastic modulus. A common use of boron fibers is in the construction of high tensile strength tapes. Boron fiber use results in high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods. In the production process, elemental boron is deposited on an even tungsten wire substrate which produces diameters of 4.0 mil (102 micron) and 5.6 mil (142 micron). It consists of a fully borided tungsten core with amorphous boron. Boron fibers and sub- millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450 GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17 GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.

It is known commonly as the chestnut weevil. It is a serious pest of chestnut (Castanea sativa).Paparatti, B. & Speranza, S. (1999). Biological control of chestnut weevil (Curculio elephas Gyll.; Coleoptera, Curculionidae) with the entomopathogens fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuill.(Deuteromycotina, Hyphomycetes). In: II International Symposium on Chestnut 1998. pp. 459-466. The adult female weevil drills a hole in a chestnut fruit and deposits one egg inside. When the larva emerges it feeds on the fruit. It emerges from the chestnut, drops to the ground, and immediately buries itself several centimeters deep in the soil. Larvae may pupate in the soil for one season or for several years. The adult emerges and lives in the canopy of the chestnut tree. In some chestnut-growing regions, infestation of the fruit by weevil larvae can reach 90%. Chemical control of the pest is difficult. Other suggested control methods include collecting fallen chestnuts which may contain larvae, and the use of biological pest control agents, such as fungi.Menu, F. & Debouzie, D. (1995).

Twenty-two border guards were killed in the attack, which was one of the biggest since the July 2013 ouster of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi and the second at the same checkpoint in less than three months. Background Militant groups such as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis have ramped up an anti-military campaign that involves bombings and shootings in Egypt since the 2013 coup d'√©tat which saw the removal of President Mohamed Morsi, followed by a violent crackdown on his supporters. The same checkpoint was attacked less than two months earlier when five army conscripts were killed by gunmen. The perpetrators of the second attack were initially described as smugglers by security officials interviewed by Reuters, who said that they are being paid by their militant comrades in Egypt to ship them weapons from Libya, a country plagued by instability following the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Attack The checkpoint, situated on the Farafra Oasis Road near the borders with Libya, was attacked by 20 gunmen, initially described as smugglers, in weapon-mounted vehicles with machine guns as well as rocket-propelled grenades that were used to blow up an ammunitions storage. After the 30-minute exchange of fire, the checkpoint was destroyed, with twenty-one soldiers killed, some of them burned, and some others wounded. This was followed by clashes where three of the attackers were killed by security forces. The militants also tried to infiltrate the site with two booby trapped vehicles, but the army said that they were retrieved and defused by bomb experts. Ambulances were sent to the location, as well as reinforcements which included army helicopters and special forces to hunt down the militants. =Investigation= Military investigations showed that one of the vehicles used was stolen from the previous incident on the same checkpoint. They also indicated that the attack was planned and that heavy cast bullets were found at the site. The slain attackers were held by authorities and were later identified as non- Egyptians by the military prosecutor. A security source suspected the involvement of Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, adding that an Islamic black standard was raised during the assault. =Convictions= On 11 October 2017, thirteen people were sentenced to death by a military court for their involvement in the attack--twelve of them in absentia. An additional ten people were convicted in absentia in December 2017, including Hesham Ashmawy of Ansar Bait al-Maqdis.

Although it is considered a ghost town because there are no significant structures left at the site, the USGS classifies Randolph as a populated place. It is on the north bank the Coquille River about north of Bandon and about 3 miles east of the Pacific Ocean. History The community was established during a brief gold rush in Coos County by a Doctor Foster and a Captain Harris. According to History of Southern Oregon (1884), they named the place after John Randolph of Roanoke, a Virginia politician. However, an article published by the Oregon Historical Society in 1957 suggests two other possibilities: that it was named for Randolph, Massachusetts, or for one of the founders of Port Orford, Oregon, Randolph Tichenor. The site was first located several miles northwest of its current location, near the confluence of Whisky Run‚Äìa small stream‚Äìand the ocean. The sands at this location were mined between 1853 and 1855. A legend states that two miners buried a five-gallon can of gold dust under a tree in those days, but when they returned a forest fire had swept through the area, so they were unable to locate the gold, which has never been found. The locale was originally named Whisky Run, and at one time it had the largest population of any gold camp on the coast, even approaching that of Jacksonville. Whisky Run was established in close proximity to an existing village of Coquille people known as the Nasomah tribe. Relations between the large group of miners and the small group of Nasomah grew increasingly tense after a series of sexual assaults on Coquille women and a verbal altercation at the Randolph Ferry over the Coquille River. In 1854, about 40 miners formed an anti-Coquille vigilante group, the Coos County Volunteers. Claiming that the Coquille had committed misdeeds such as riding a horse without permission, the Volunteers attacked the Nasomahs as they slept and killed about 20 of them. Joel Palmer, the Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, responded to the massacre by persuading the remaining Coquilles to sign a treaty surrendering ownership of their homeland of about in 1855 and agreeing to be transported to the Coast Indian Reservation further north. A somewhat different account of relations between the Nasomah and the miners appears in Verne Bright's \\"Randolph: Ghost Gold Town of the Oregon Beaches\\". In this account, some of the mutual antagonism stemmed from a fight in 1851 in which the Nasomah attacked twelve white men traveling along the Coquille River by canoe, killing eight of them. This incident, Bright says, was preceded by two decades during which white sailors and settlers infected many Nasomah and other Tututni with Old World diseases, usurped their hunting and fishing grounds, and generally treated them with cruel disrespect. After the 1851 fight, \\"The \\"Indians pillaged and murdered at intervals during the months that followed, and Randolph's earliest miners worked in the shadow of continued peril.\\" For their part, the miners retaliated by summarily hanging or shooting Indians accused of theft. These acts of violence and related fears culminated in the formation of what Bright refers to as the Randolph Minute Men, who attacked the defiant Nasomah at night, killing sixteen, wounding four, taking \\"two score women, children, and old men\\" prisoner, and burning the Nasomah village. Violence continued at a reduced level until the removal of most of the remaining Indians to the Coast Reservation. Whisky Run was later moved to the mouth of the Coquille River, and after the gold rush subsided, it was moved inland to its current location. A trail, originally established by the Coquille people, ran from the original site of Randolph to Empire. Randolph post office opened in 1859 and ran until 1893.

P. Kotlyarevsky (or Kharkiv Conservatory or Kharkiv National I. P. Kotlyarevsky University of Arts) is the leading music and drama institution of higher education in Ukraine. The university trains about 900 undergraduates, graduates and postgraduates in music and theatre art. It enjoys Level IV accreditation, which is the highest under Ukraine's national standards, and is licensed to train foreign students. History The roots of the University can be traced back to the Musical classes opened in 1871 under the aegis of Kharkiv branch of the Russian Imperial Music Society. Kharkiv Conservatory was established in 1917, a result of professional music education development in Kharkiv. Prominent among those who stood at the origins of the conservatory were P. Tchaikovsky, O. Glazunov, I. Slatin. The conservatory was several times renamed. Since 1920 it was known as Music Academy, but in 1923 with the opening of theatre major the academy was turned into the Institute of Music and Drama, and later into Kharkiv State Conservatory (1934) and Institute of Arts (1963). All these names reflect the search for the most optimal model of artistic education. In 2004 the institute was awarded the university status and the highest Level IV accreditation. That was another step into the future; it confirmed integration into the European system of education and contributed to the strengthening of the university's international credibility. On the occasion of its 90th anniversary the University was awarded the Diploma of the Cabinet of Ministry of Ukraine and a gold medal of the Academy of Arts of Ukraine. In 2011 it was given the status of National importance.  Directors and Rectors  The first head ‚Äî I. I. Slatin (Photo from Yu. Shcherbinin's archive) Present Rector ‚Äî –¢. B. Verkina (photo by G.

Background The shop was one of the new wave of fashionable boutiques that were revitalising Carnaby Street which before the early 1960s had been a down-at-heel area of mixed shops. Lady Jane was on the site of a former dairy. Designer Marion Foale described the general Carnaby area in 1962 as follows: \\"People lived there, there was a dairy, a tobacconist, a newsagent ‚Äì there was this little courtyard and everything‚Ä¶ a proper village, though very run down.\\"Interview with Marion Foale and Sally Tuffin, April 2006.

In a 1967 publicity stunt Harry Fox stood for election as 'Independent Carnaby Street' candidates for the Cities of London & Westminster. Lady Jane had a reputation for being a little shocking. When a see-through clothing craze started in London fashion in the late 1960s, the shop retained artist Audrey Watson to paint bras on its female customers.

Biography  His father was a farmer and miller. It is said that he first became interested in art when he saw a display in the window of a lithographer's shop. His talent was noticed at school, but came to little until a local aristocrat asked Jans to make drawings of a castle, \\"Steentien\\", which he was restoring. He was sufficiently impressed to offer Jans a chance to study at the local art school (the Bogaerdeschool). In his first year, he received orders for drawings from the Mayor and other notables. This made it possible for him to attend the Bruges Academy of Fine Arts in 1869, studying with the Director, Edouard Wallays (1813-1891). By 1873, he was a teacher at the Bogaerdeschool. Two years later, he was accepted at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp) and placed in the Master Class, where his instructor was Nicaise De Keyser. He also studied genre painting with Polydore Beaufaux and Charles Verlat. Although he specialized in portraits, he also did Biblical scenes, history paintings and landscapes. In 1876, he received a scholarship from the Prix de Rome for his painting \\"Return of the Prodigal Son\\", which enabled him to travel throughout Europe, visiting France, Italy, Germany and Austria. When he returned to Antwerp in 1889, he was appointed a Professor at the Academy and held that position until his death. A street in Bruges is named after him. His daughter Luisa also became a painter. References Further reading * R. De Laere, De herdenking Eduard de Jans te Sint-Andries, 16 juni 1935 (Memorial), Kroniek van Sint-Andries, Neptunus n.v.

The region emerged as the foremost centre of culture in Indian subcontinent during the rule of Kakatiya, the Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi dynasties‚Äî (also known as the Nizams of Hyderabad). The rulers' patronage and interest for arts and culture transformed Telangana into a unique multi- cultural region where two different cultures coexist together, thus making Telangana the representative of the Deccan Plateau and its heritage with Warangal and Hyderabad being its epicenter. The regions' major cultural events celebrated are \\"Kakatiya Festival\\" and Deccan Festival along with religious festivals Bonalu, Bathukamma, Dasara, Ugadi, Sankranthi, Milad un Nabi and Ramadan. Telangana State has long been a meeting place for diverse languages and cultures. It is known as \\"South of North and North of South\\". It is also known for its Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb and the capital Hyderabad is known as a miniature India.  Languages  About 76% of the population of Telangana speak Telugu, 12% speak Urdu, and 12% speak other languages. Before 1948, Urdu was the official language of Hyderabad State, and due to a lack of Telugu- language educational institutions, Urdu was the language of the educated elite of Telangana. After 1948, once Hyderabad State joined the new Republic of India, Telugu became the language of government, and as Telugu was introduced as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges, the use of Urdu among non-Muslims decreased. ‚Äì People not interested in dividing Andhra Pradesh.  Literature  Poets of Telangana from the early era include Pothana, Kancherla Gopanna or Bhakta Ramadasu, Malliya Rechana, Gona Budda Reddy, Palkurthi Somanatha, MallinƒÅtha S≈´ri, and Hulukki Bhaskara. In the modern era poets include such figures as Padma Vibhushan Kaloji Narayana Rao, Sahitya Akademi Award recipient Daasarathi Krishnamacharyulu, and Jnanpith Award recipient C. Narayana Reddy, as well as P. V. Narasimha Rao, ninth Prime Minister of India. Samala Sadasiva was selected for the Kendra Sahitya Puraskaram distinction. His book Swaralayalu on the subject of Hindustani classical music won the award for the year 2011. Urdu literature has always enjoyed patronage from successive rulers of the Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi era. Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty is regarded as one of the pioneers of early Urdu poetry. During the rule of Nizams of Hyderabad, printing was introduced in the area. The 18th century courtesan and poetess Mah Laqa Bai is also regarded as a pioneer of this time. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many Urdu scholars emigrated to Hyderabad seeking patronage of the Nizam. This included Fani Badayuni, Josh Malihabadi and Dagh Dehlavi. Other scholars of repute from Telangana included Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri.  Religion  The major religions of the people are Hinduism and Islam, though Buddhism was the dominant religion up to the 6th century. It is the home of Mahayana Buddhism as revealed by the monuments of Nagarjunakonda. Acharaya Nagarjuna presided over the World University at Sri Parvata. Hinduism was revived during the time of the Chalukyas and the Kakatiyas in the 12th century. The Vijayanagar rule saw the glorious days of Hinduism when the famed emperors, Krishnadeva Raya in particular, built new temples and beautified the old ones. Siva, Vishnu, Hanuman and Ganapati have been the popular Hindu Gods. The Vugra Narasimha Swami Temple at Yadagirigutta and Thousand Pillar Temple at Warangal are among the oldest shrines in the state attracting people from different parts of the country for hundreds of years. In terms of influence, Islam occupies the second place. It started spreading from the 14th century onwards. Mosques began to come up in many parts of the region during the Muslim rule. Christianity began to spread from 1701, Especially among the socially disabled people. Educational institutions and churches grew in number in the Circars in the 18th-19th centuries when the East India Company and later the British government encouraged them. Other European countries were also active in building churches and taking care of the weaker sections of the people. = Major Religious Structures = Bhadrachalam Temple Yadadri : Lord Vishnu (whose reincarnation is Lord Narasimha).

The Telangana state lies on the Deccan plateau and its topography dictates more millet and roti (leavened bread) based dishes. Jowar and Bajra features more prominently in their cuisine. Due to its proximity with Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and northwest Karnataka, it shares some similarities of the Deccan plateau cuisine. The region has the spiciest food amongst all other Telugu and Indian cuisines. Telangana has some unique dishes in its cuisine, such as jonna rotte (sorghum), sajja rotte (penisetum), or Uppudi Pindi (broken rice).

It is stated: \\"Burning takes place by parallel layers where the surface of the grain regresses, layer by layer, normal to the surface at every point.\\" The propellant grain of this model rocket engine is designed to function in accordance with Piobert's law. History The law was devised by French general Guillaume Piobert in 1839 to explain the behavior of gunpowder, but it has subsequently been applied to other solid propellants. Description of the reaction as burning may cause confusion with simple atmospheric combustion of solid materials where a similar reaction progression may be attributed to availability of the oxygen reactant only at the surface of the solid being consumed by the reaction. In the case of single-phase propellant grains, the progression is attributed to heat transfer from the surface of the solid of energy necessary to initiate the reaction. The heat transfer rate increases with pressure; and smokeless powder reaction rates vary with pressure as described by Paul Vieille in 1893. Mechanism Studies of solid single- and double-base propellant reactions suggest a series of zones or phases as the reaction proceeds from the surface into the solid. The deepest portion of the solid experiencing heat transfer melts and begins phase transition from solid to gas in a foam zone. The gaseous propellant decomposes into simpler molecules in a surrounding fizz zone. Energy is released in a luminous outer flame zone where the simpler gas molecules react to form conventional combustion products like steam and carbon monoxide. Propellants designed for a minimum heat transfer pressure may fail to sustain the flame zone at lower pressures. References  Bibliography  G.

The first to draw attention to it was the Egyptologist Heinrich Karl Brugsch, who published about it in 1876.H. Brugsch, √ÑZ 14 (1876) 1-4. Date The papyrus stems from year 6 of the Whm Mswt or Renaissance, an era which started in year 19 of king Ramesses XI of the Twentieth Dynasty. In his year 19 this king started to count anew, with his year 19 either totally or partly coinciding with year 1 of the new era. Since some of the documents from the Whm Mswt are implicitly dated (i.e., without reference to the era), it is not always directly clear from the dateline whether a document stems from the ordinary year count of Ramesses XI or from the Whm Mswt.Ad Thijs, Once more, the length of the Ramesside Renaissance, GM 240 (2014), 69-81 However, with Pap. Ambras there can be no doubt, since it explicitly mentions the Whm Mswt in its dateline. Content Pap. Ambras is inscribed on the recto only and sums up the content of two jars filled with documents.T.E. Peet, The great tomb-robberies of the Twentieth Egyptian Dynasty, Oxford 1930, 177-181 It is clear that Ambras was meant as an inventory, probably to be stored with the jars themselves. The papyrus states that these documents had been bought back from the people, apparently after they had been stolen during the Suppression of the Theban High Priest of Amun, Amenhotep, which is supposed to have taken place just prior to the start of the Renaissance. Identification of the papyri T. Eric Peet has suggested that several of the eight papyri from the second jar are to be identified as well known papyri concerning tomb robberies which have actually come down to us. He identified:T.E. Peet, o.c., 179-180Ad Thijs, Reconsidering the End of the Twentieth Dynasty Part V, P. Ambras as an advocate of a shorter chronology, GM 179 (2000), 73 -[ recto 2.2-3 ]: Pap. BM 10068, recto -[ recto 2.4 ]: Pap. Abbott (‚ÄúThe examination of the Pyramid- tombs‚Äù) -[ recto 2.5-6 ]: Pap. BM 10054 -[ recto 2.7 ]: Pap. Leopold II- Amherst (‚ÄúThe examination concerning the pyramid of the King of Upper Egypt Sekhemre‚Äôshedtaui‚Äù) -[ recto 2.8-9 ]: (not identified) -[ recto 2.10 ]: Pap. BM 10053, recto -[ recto 2.11 ]: (not identified) -[ recto 2.12 ]: (not identified) In 2000 Ad Thijs published an article in which he drew renewed attention to the observations of Peet. His identifications differ slightly from those of Peet:Ad Thijs, Reconsidering the End of the Twentieth Dynasty Part V, P. Ambras as an advocate of a shorter chronology, GM 179 (2000), 69-83 -[ recto 2.2-3 ]: Pap. BM 10068, recto -[ recto 2.4 ]: Pap. Abbott, but possibly not the copy which survivedAd Thijs, GM 179 (2000), 71-72 -[ recto 2.5-6 ]: (not identified) -[ recto 2.7 ]: Pap. Leopold II-Amherst -[ recto 2.8-9 ]: (not identified) -[ recto 2.10 ]: Pap. BM 10053, recto -[ recto 2.11 ]: Pap. BM 10054, the list of thieves contained on verso 5-6 -[ recto 2.12 ]: perhaps Pap. Mayer B (?) Chronological significance All these documents, c.q. texts stem from the first wave of tomb-robbery trials which took place in year 16 and 17 of Ramesses IX. However, as Peet noted, the verso of both Pap. BM 10068 and Pap. BM 10053 contains additional entries which are not described in Pap. Ambras: * on the verso of Pap. BM 10068 we find two lists, commonly known as the ‚Äúlist of houses‚Äù, from an anonymous year 12T.E. Peet, o.c., 93-98 and the ‚Äú≈†rmt-list‚Äù of which the date has not been filled in, but which must be slightly later than the ‚Äúlist of houses‚Äù due to the placing of the columns of text on the papyrus.T.E. Peet, o.c., 92-93 * on the verso of Pap. BM 10053 we find a text, dating from an anonymous year 9, dealing with thefts from the mortuary temples of Ramesses II and Ramesses III.T.E. Peet, o.c., 112-122 It is more than likely that these thefts could only have taken place during the chaotic period when the High Priest of Amun, Amenhotep, was temporarily suppressed by the Viceroy of Kush Pinehesy. These additional entries on the verso are important texts in themselves and should have been included in the inventory. From this, Peet concluded that these entries were added only after the repurchase of the papyri in year 6 of the Whm Mswt. This would mean that the dates of the \\"list of houses\\" (year 12) and the \\"≈†rmt-list\\" (year 12 or later) would become the highest known for the Whm Mswt. However, when Peet made his observations, it was still totally unclear where the Whm Mswt should be placed chronologically, so he could never press his case and his observations were more or less forgotten. When the start of the Whm Mswt finally became (correctly) dated to year 19 of Ramesses XI, the texts on the verso‚Äôs of Pap. BM 10053 and 10068 became ascribed to the part of the reign of Ramesses XI prior to his proclamation of the Whm Mswt.

Life He was the son of the painter Simon Quaglio, who gave him his first art lessons. In 1862, he enrolled at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied under Franz Adam. He specialized in rural genre scenes, occasionally treating more dramatic subjects such as soldiers and acrobats. His chief influences were his uncle Lorenzo Quaglio and Carl Theodor von Piloty, later deriving some techniques from the impressionists. He was a very prolific painter and travelled extensively, visiting Turkey, Greece and the Caucasus. Although he never held a formal teaching position, he often gave private art lessons.

Aeolian research is a sub-discipline of the physical sciences that focuses on the activity of the winds, with an emphasis on the winds' ability to interact with and shape the surface of the Earth and other planets. Aeolian research spans a broad array of disciplines and may include the study of aeolian processes and associated aeolian landforms, aeolian deposits, and sedimentary features; the study of wind erosion and its control by tillage, cover crops, shelterbelts, and other management practices; and the study of mineral dust, dust storms and the effects of fine particulate matter on climate and air quality. An extensive Bibliography of Aeolian Research (BAR) was constructed that contains references to every known scientific manuscript published in the field of aeolian research from 1646 to 2015. The BAR contains over 43,000 bibliographic citations. As with most bibliographies, the Bibliography of Aeolian Research has benefited from past bibliographies. The BAR lists more than forty-five bibliographies that focus on at least one aspect of aeolian research and parts of these have been incorporated into the BAR. Older bibliographies are especially important because they provide a record of early publications. The oldest bibliography incorporated into the BAR is the Bibliography of Meteorology compiled by Oliver Fassig in 1889. Citations have also been extracted from the Bibliography of Eolian Geology prepared for the United States Department of Agriculture by Conrad Stuntz and Edward Free. Other important bibliographies that have been incorporated into the BAR include two online bibliographies that were maintained by Andrew Warren of University College London titled A Bibliography of Wind Erosion and Related Phenomena and A Bibliography of Desert Dunes and Associated Phenomena. The Bibliography of Aeolian Research contains more citations extracted from these two bibliographies than from any other source. Citations were also obtained from a monthly internet posting called Aeolian Papers of the Month, a list of published papers compiled each month from 1996-2001 by Thomas Gill at the Texas Tech University. Editors Andrew Warren, John Stout and Thomas Gill collected bibliographic citations by searching databases and extracting citations from recent publications. New entries included citations to scholarly articles, books, theses, dissertations, and reports.

Oil and gas explorations are also located in the Principe Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the Nigeria-S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe Joint Development Zone (JDZ). History ERHC completed an airborne Full Tensor Gravity (FTG) survey of Block 11A in northwestern Kenya in January 2014. Bell Geospace flew the FTG on ERHC's behalf and acquired a total of 14,943.8 line km. The results confirmed that the Lotikipi basin extends into Block 11A and provided the company‚Äôs exploration team with new information to aid in the identification of the most prospective areas in the area. That month ERHC contracted BGP Inc., a Chinese geophysical service company, to its northern Kenya exploration block and identify the best possible drilling spots. The company set aside $40 million for the venture. In February 2014, ERHC completed its farmout agreement with CEPSA, a Spanish oil and gas company. Following the agreement, CEPSA acquired a 55 percent stake in Block 11A. ERHC retained 35 percent of interest in Block 11A. Chadian President Idriss D√©by gave ERHC his approval to retain oil exploration block BDS 2008 and voluntary relinquishment of the Manga and Chari-Ouest III Blocks in May 2014. The company holds 100% of the interest in block BDS 2008 in southern Chad which encompasses 41800 square km. After the approval, ERHC began using a series of convertible notes to fund a magnetic/gravity survey and a 2D seismic acquisition program. In 2015, ERHC partnered with Cepsa to further exploration in Kenya on Block 11A.That January, the company announced that it was continuing its exploration program in Kenya. ERHC discovered the Tarach-1 prospect-drilling site for the first exploration well in June 2015. 13 drillable prospects were identified in the basin.

Plot On the distant planet Aqua Terra, there are no men; only women. In order to procreate, men are abducted from Earth every 20 years. So Queen Morganna sends Commander Danow and her officer, Annie, to Earth aboard their spaceship, the Phalanx. Upon watching videos, both officers opt for bikinis as adequate clothing for women. Once on Earth, they ask Kim read for help in selecting men as targets. Kim is a student who encrypted the officers' notes regularly by sleeping with the teaching staff. Upon succeeding with Kim's help in collecting Gary, her husband, the two officers contact their home planet. They decide to kidnap two men. Ultimately, the officers shrink the men down with a radiating device, as well as three more men, Professor Quartermass, Agent Decker and Gary, and bring them aboard their ship. Background The film was produced by the production company Image Entertainment and distributed by Retromedia Entertainment. It was broadcast several times in Winter 2006 at fixed times and on demand on the premium channels Cinemax and HBO. The film was shot simultaneously with Ghost in a Teeny Bikini. The video sequences that serve the two alien women to learn about Earth were from other adult films directed by Fred Olen Ray.

The fort straddles the borough of Waverley in Surrey and the borough of Rushmoor and the district of Hart, both in Hampshire. Caesar's Camp is a Scheduled Ancient Monument with a list entry identification number of 1007895. It lies approximately north of the town of Farnham, and a similar distance west of Aldershot. The hillfort lies entirely within the Bourley and Long Valley Site of Special Scientific Interest. Caesar's Camp is a multivallate hillfort, a fort with multiple defensive rings, occupying an irregular promontory, with an entrance on the south side. The site has been much disturbed by military activity, especially at the southeast corner. The remains of the hillfort are considered to be of national importance. History It is possible that Caesar's Camp developed in the Late Bronze Age, as a fort associated with the River Wey. There were three Iron Age phases of the fort. In its earliest form, Caesar's Camp was a univallate fort. In its second phase of development, the defences were multivallate with a timber palisade. Later, a bank was built over the line of the palisade, replacing it. After the third phase, the site was apparently abandoned until the medieval period, when a park pale was built, making use of the final phase of the Iron Age defences. Caesar's Camp belonged to the Farnham estate of the Bishop of Winchester in the 11th century; by the 13th century it formed part of a park associated with Farnham Castle. Site description Caesar's Camp stands above mean sea level, and the Bagshot Beds of sand surface on the northern slopes of the hill. The area around the hillfort features extensive areas of open heathland. The defences on the east side have been damaged by a modern quarry. The interior of the fort is largely undisturbed, and the rarity of large multivallate Iron Age forts has resulted in Caesar's Camp being regarded as of national importance by Historic England. The fort is large and encloses an area of . The earthwork ramparts and ditches largely follow the contours of the hill. The ramparts cut across the neck of the plateau on the south side; on the north and northeast sides there are no earthwork defences since the steep scarps render them unnecessary. On the southwest side, marshland was incorporated into the defences, and gaps in the rampart occur in that area. On the east side the defences consisted of a double rampart. The inner rampart is wide and high; the ditch between the ramparts is deep and wide. The outer rampart is wide and stands high. Outside the second rampart is another ditch, this measuring deep. On the southeast side, the defences consisted of a triple rampart and a counter-scarp bank that continued to the south side. The fort's defences were strongest on the south, where they cut across level ground. The main entrance to the fort is believed to have been halfway along the east side; however, direct evidence is lacking due to the damage caused to the supposed entrance by modern quarrying. A trackway cuts through the strong defences on the south side, but this may be modern. The medieval park pale is evident as a bank and accompanying ditch running along the western edge of Caesar's Camp. The bank is wide and stands high. The ditch runs on the inside of the bank and measures wide and is deep. Some outside the rampart on the southwest side are the remains of what has been interpreted as a defensive outlier, or an earlier version of the defences, consisting of a low wide rampart. However, this feature may instead be the misinterpreted remains of the medieval park pale, the spoil of which was thrown over the Iron Age defences. Finds A trench was excavated by N. Riall in 1983. Miscellaneous finds at Caesar's Camp include a Roman roof tile, which is now held in Camberley Museum, and an early rapier dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500‚Äì1000 BC). The sword has been assigned to the Thetford Class of Trump's Group II, characterised by a trapezoid butt with two noches, and dated to 1200‚Äì1000 BC. The weapon is forged from a copper alloy and has a fluted blade with three central ribs. It has a total length of ; the blade is wide and thick. The hilt plate is wide. This sword is now held in the British Museum.

Video footage of the incident generated widespread national attention and raised questions about the appropriate use of force by law enforcement. NYPD officers approached Garner on July 17 on suspicion of selling single cigarettes from packs without tax stamps. After Garner told the police that he was tired of being harassed and that he was not selling cigarettes, the officers attempted to arrest Garner. When Pantaleo placed his hands on Garner, Garner pulled his arms away. Pantaleo then placed his arm around Garner's neck and wrestled him to the ground. With multiple officers pinning him down, Garner repeated the words \\"I can't breathe\\" 11 times while lying face down on the sidewalk. After Garner lost consciousness, he remained lying on the sidewalk for seven minutes while the officers waited for an ambulance to arrive. Garner was pronounced dead at an area hospital approximately one hour later. The medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide. According to the medical examiner's definition, a homicide is a death caused by the intentional actions of another person or persons. Specifically, an autopsy indicated that Garner's death resulted from \\"[compression] of neck, compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police\\". Asthma, heart disease, and obesity were cited as contributing factors. On December 4, 2014, a Richmond County grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo. This decision stirred public protests and rallies, with charges of police brutality made by protesters. By December 28, 2014, at least 50 demonstrations had been held nationwide in response to the Garner case, while hundreds of demonstrations against general police brutality counted Garner as a focal point. On July 13, 2015, an out-of- court settlement was reached, under which the City of New York would pay the Garner family $5.9 million. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice declined to bring criminal charges against Pantaleo under federal civil rights laws. A New York Police Department disciplinary hearing regarding Pantaleo's treatment of Garner was held in the summer of 2019; on August 2, 2019, an administrative judge recommended that Pantaleo's employment be terminated. Pantaleo was fired on August 19, 2019, more than five years after Garner's death. People involved =Eric Garner= Eric Garner (September 15, 1970 ‚Äì July 17, 2014) was an African-American man. He was a horticulturist at the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation before quitting for health reasons. Garner, who was married to Esaw Garner, has been described by his friends as a \\"neighborhood peacemaker\\" and as a generous, congenial person. He was the father of six children, had three grandchildren, and at the time of his death had a 3-month-old child. Garner had been arrested by the NYPD more than 30 times since 1980 on charges such as assault, resisting arrest, and grand larceny. According to an article in The New York Times many of these arrests had been for allegedly selling unlicensed cigarettes. In 2007, he filed a handwritten complaint in federal court accusing a police officer of conducting a cavity search of him on the street, \\"digging his fingers in my rectum in the middle of the street\\" while people passed by. Garner had, according to The New York Times, \\"recently ... told lawyers at Legal Aid that he intended to take all the cases against him to trial\\". At the time of the incident, he was out on bail for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, driving without a license, marijuana possession, and false impersonation. =Daniel Pantaleo= At the time of Garner's death, Daniel Pantaleo was a 29-year-old New York City Police Department officer living in Eltingville, Staten Island. He joined the NYPD in 2006 after graduating from Monsignor Farrell High School, and with a bachelor's degree from the College of Staten Island. Pantaleo was the subject of two civil rights lawsuits in 2013 where plaintiffs accused him of falsely arresting them and abusing them. In one of the cases, he and other officers allegedly ordered two black men to strip naked on the street for a search and the charges against the men were dismissed. =Ramsey Orta= Ramsey Orta is a member of Copwatch in New York City who filmed the incident. Following a campaign of alleged police harassment after the video went viral, he was arrested on weapons charges. Al Sharpton made a statement that prosecuting Orta while also calling him as a witness could constitute a conflict of interest. In February 2015, Orta was incarcerated on Rikers Island. After falling ill multiple times after eating food on Rikers, Orta believed he had been deliberately poisoned. In March 2015, a lockdown was initiated, and Orta could not prepare his own food. The prisoners were served meatloaf by the prison officers. Orta describes that the other prisoners fell ill, vomiting blood, but the guards reportedly laughed and no prisoners were brought to the infirmary. Court documents stated that the prisoners had suffered from various ailments after eating the food. Blue-green pellets were found in the meatloaf, and determined to be brodifacoum, the main ingredient of rat poison. As a result, Orta stopped eating the prison food, only taking food passed to him from his visiting wife. Orta has alleged that prison officers booked him on false or trivial offences in a biased manner, resulting in him not being able to receive food from his wife. Orta also claimed that the prison officers have threatened him, insulted him, beaten him, and deliberately crushed the food from Orta's wife. Orta stated that when he was initially arrested, a police officer told him it would be better for Orta to kill himself before he was jailed. After prosecutors questioned whether the money raised for his bail was crowd-sourced legally, Orta was released on bail on April 10, 2015. In 2016, he was sentenced to four years in prison for weapons and drug charges after accepting a plea deal for which the prosecutor agreed to drop charges against his mother. In May 2020, he was released from Groveland Correctional Facility. His release was in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Events of July 17, 2014 On July 17, 2014, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Garner was approached by a plainclothes police officer, Justin D'Amico, in front of a beauty supply store at 202 Bay Street in Tompkinsville, Staten Island. According to bystanders (including a friend of Garner, Ramsey Orta, who recorded the incident on his cell phone) Garner had just broken up a fight, which may have drawn the attention of the police. Officers confronted Garner and accused him of selling \\"loosies\\" (single cigarettes without a tax stamp) in violation of New York state law. Garner is heard on the video saying the following: When Pantaleo approached Garner from behind and attempted to handcuff him, Garner pulled his arms away, saying, \\"Don't touch me, please.\\" Pantaleo then placed his arm around Garner's neck and pulled him backward in an attempt to bring him to the ground; in the process, Pantaleo and Garner slammed into a glass window, which did not break. Garner went to his knees and forearms and did not say anything for a few seconds. At that point, three uniformed officers and the two plainclothes officers had surrounded him. After 15 seconds, the video shows Pantaleo removing his arm from around Garner's neck; Pantaleo then used his hands to push Garner's face into the sidewalk. Garner is heard saying \\"I can't breathe\\" eleven times while lying face down on the sidewalk. The arrest was supervised by a female African-American NYPD sergeant, Kizzy Adonis, who did not intercede. Adonis was quoted in the original police report as stating, \\"The perpetrator's condition did not seem serious and he did not appear to get worse.\\" A police sergeant called an ambulance and indicated that Mr. Garner was having trouble breathing, but reportedly added that he \\"did not appear to be in great distress\\". Garner lay motionless, handcuffed, and unresponsive for several minutes before an ambulance arrived, as shown in a second video. After Garner lost consciousness, officers turned him onto his side to ease his breathing. Garner remained lying on the sidewalk for seven minutes. When an ambulance arrived, two medics and two EMTs inside the ambulance did not place Garner on oxygen, administer any emergency medical aid or promptly place him on a stretcher. According to police, Garner had a heart attack while being transported to Richmond University Medical Center. He was pronounced dead at the hospital one hour later. A funeral was held for Garner on July 23, 2014, at Bethel Baptist Church in Brooklyn. At the funeral, Al Sharpton gave a speech calling for harsher punitive measures to be taken against the officers responsible for the incident. Immediate aftermath On July 20, Pantaleo was put on desk duty and stripped of his service handgun and badge. Justin D'Amico was allowed to keep his badge and handgun, but was also placed on desk duty. Four of the EMTs and paramedics who took Garner to the hospital were suspended on July 21. Two of the paramedics were soon returned to their duties, and the remaining two EMTs were doing non-medical work at the hospital pending the Richmond University Medical Center's own investigation into the incident. =Medical examiner's report and autopsy= On August 1, 2014, the New York City Medical Examiner's Office ruled Garner's death a homicide. According to the medical examiner's definition, a homicide is a death caused by the intentional actions of another person or persons, which is not necessarily an intentional death or a criminal death. Garner's death was also found by the medical examiner to have resulted from \\"compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police\\". Asthma and heart disease were cited as contributing factors. Prior to that, on July 19, 2014, The New York Post published a report, citing unnamed sources, claiming the medical examiner had found no damage to Garner's \\"windpipe or neckbones\\" during a preliminary autopsy. Garner's family hired Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner, to perform an independent autopsy. Baden agreed with the findings of the Medical Examiner's Office and concluded that Garner's death was primarily caused by \\"compression of the neck\\". Baden reported finding hemorrhaging around Garner's neck, which was indicative of neck compression. Pantaleo's union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, noted that Garner's hyoid bone was not fractured. Barbara Sampson, the New York City medical examiner, said that \\"It is false that crushing of the windpipe and fracture of the hyoid bone would necessarily be seen at autopsy as the result of a chokehold.\\" =Protests= Sharpton organized a protest in Staten Island on the afternoon of July 19; he condemned the use of a chokehold on Garner, saying that \\"there is no justification\\" for it. On July 28, a protest organized by WalkRunFly Productions and poet Daniel J. Watts was held in Times Square. The protest was in the form of poetry and many Broadway entertainers participated in the event. Al Sharpton originally planned to lead a protest on August 23 in which participants would drive over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, then travel to the site of the altercation and the office of District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan, Jr. This idea was scrapped in favor of Sharpton's leading a march along Bay Street in Staten Island, where Garner died; police estimated that over 2,500 people participated in the march. In March 2015, Assata's Daughters, a Chicago-based black activist group, formed because they saw a lack of response by public officials to Eric Garner's death. Grand jury =Grand jury deliberation= On August 19, Richmond County (Staten Island) District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan, Jr. brought against Pantaleo to a grand jury, saying that after considering the medical examiner's findings, his office decided \\"it is appropriate to present evidence regarding circumstances of his death to a Richmond County Grand Jury.\\" On September 29, the grand jury began hearing evidence in the Garner case. On November 21, Pantaleo testified before the grand jury for about two hours. After considering the case for two months, the grand jury decided on December 3 not to indict Pantaleo. Under New York law, most of the grand jury proceedings were kept secret, including the exact charges sought by the prosecutor, the autopsy report, and transcripts of testimony. Attempts by the New York Civil Liberties Union and others to gain release of that information have been unsuccessful. =Reaction= Public Chicago protesters protesting the Staten Island grand jury's decision, December 4, 2014 After the Staten Island grand jury did not indict Pantaleo on December 3, citizens in New York City and San Francisco gathered in protest, demonstrating with several die-ins, making speeches and rallies against the lack of indictment. On December 5, thousands gathered in protest on the Boston Common in Boston, and then marched in the downtown area, blocking traffic, especially on I-90, in addition to staging \\"die-ins.\\" Protests also occurred in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. At least 300 people were arrested at the New York City protests on December 4 and 5, most of them for charges of disorderly conduct or refusal to clear the streets, but two for assault on a police officer. On December 6, 300 protesters marched in Berkeley, California as well. On December 10, 76 protesters were arrested at Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush in west London, England, during a rally to show solidarity with rallies in the United States. Protesters have made use of Garner's last words, \\"I can't breathe\\", as a slogan and chant against police brutality since Garner's death and Pantaleo's grand jury decision. By December 28, at least 50 protests in support of Garner had occurred globally, and many other Black Lives Matter-related demonstrations had occurred. Counter-protests were also launched in support of police, specifically for the NYPD. On December 19, during a New York City protest about the grand jury decision, supporters of the NYPD held a counter- demonstration, wearing shirts with the phrase, \\"I can breathe, thanks to the NYPD\\", on them, holding signs with phrases like \\"Bluelivesmatter\\", and chanting, \\"Don't resist arrest.\\" On December 20, two NYPD officers were killed in an ambush in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn. The suspected gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, cited Garner's death at the hands of police (as well as that of Michael Brown) as reasons to kill police officers. Brinsley then entered the New York City Subway and committed suicide. Garner's death has been cited as one of several police killings of African Americans protested by the Black Lives Matter movement. Police As a result of Garner's death, Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the NYPD's training procedures, specifically focusing on the appropriate amount of force that can be used while detaining a suspect. An unnamed NYPD official quoted in the New York Post said that the $35 million retraining efforts were ineffective and a \\"waste of time.\\" Patrick Lynch, leader of the police union Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, challenged the claim that a chokehold was used, further stating that the union would be able to find many use-of-force experts who would also challenge the claim that a chokehold was used. Lynch also attributed Garner's death to resisting arrest and, \\"a lack of the respect for law enforcement, resulting from the slanderous, insulting, and unjust manner in which police officers are being portrayed.\\" Edward D. Mullins, the head of the union representing police sergeants, called on members not to slow down police response across the city by supervising every arrest. He also commented saying that the use of the term \\"chokehold\\" by the chief medical examiner's office was political. Police union officials and Pantaleo's lawyer argued that Pantaleo did not use the chokehold, but instead used a NYPD-taught takedown move because Garner was resisting arrest. Police also defended the decision not to perform CPR on Garner on the grounds that he was still breathing on his own. An Indiana police officer sold T-shirts saying \\"Breathe Easy. Don't Break the Law.\\" A veteran San Jose Police Officer, Phillip White, tweeted: \\"Threaten me or my family and I will use my God given and law appointed right and duty to kill you. #CopsLivesMatter,\\" which sparked controversy. Family In an interview with CNN, Garner's daughter Erica felt that it was pride and not racism that led to the officer choking her father. Erica held a vigil and \\"die-in\\" on December 11, 2014, on Staten Island in memory of her father, near where he died. On her Twitter account, she vowed to continue to lead protests in Staten Island twice a week, lying down in the spot where her father collapsed and died. Erica Garner died on December 30, 2017, after suffering a heart attack at the age of 27. One of Garner's daughters, Emerald Snipes, created a fund for his kids for Christmas, as Garner used to play Santa Claus. Garner's daughters Erica and Emerald, his widow Esaw, and his stepfather Ben Carr all went to the Justice for All March in Washington, D.C. After the grand jury decision, when asked whether she accepted Pantaleo's condolences, Garner's widow angrily answered, \\"Hell, no! The time for remorse would have been when my husband was yelling to breathe.\\" She added, \\"No, I don't accept his apology. No, I could care less about his condolences ... He's still working. He's still getting a paycheck. He's still feeding his kids, when my husband is six feet under and I'm looking for a way to feed my kids now.\\" Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, expressed surprise and disappointment at the grand jury decision. Politicians New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called Garner's death a \\"terrible tragedy.\\" De Blasio, at a July 31 roundtable meeting in response to the death, convened with police officers and political activists, called upon mutual respect and understanding. On August 1, in a statement, the mayor urged all parties involved to create a dialogue, and find a path \\"to heal the wounds from decades of mistrust and create a culture where the police department and the communities they protect respect each other.\\" Mayor de Blasio has been criticized by activists for not firing the officers involved in Garner's death. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that New York State should consider appointing a special prosecutor to handle cases of alleged police brutality. He told CNN: \\"We have a problem. Let's acknowledge it.\\"Larry Celona, Kirstan Conley, Bruce Golding - New York Post - Officers seethe as Hizzoner warns of cop 'dangers' - December 5, 2014 - page 6. Retrieved December 7, 2014. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said that the Department of Justice was \\"closely monitoring\\" investigations into Garner's death. Two U.S. Presidents have expressed thoughts about Garner's death. Barack Obama addressed the grand jury's decision by making a speech, stating that Garner's death and the legal outcome of it is an \\"American problem\\". Obama also reacted by saying that Garner's death \\"speaks to the larger issues\\" of trust between police and civilians. Former U.S. President George W. Bush said he found the grand jury outcome \\"hard to understand\\" and \\"very sad\\" in an interview. Rep. Peter King (R-NY) stated that, if Garner had been healthier, he would not have died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold. \\"If he had not had asthma, and a heart condition, and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died from this.\\" King added that there \\"was not a hint\\" that anyone used any racial epithets, and that if Garner were a \\"350-pound white guy, he would have been treated the same.\\" Celebrities Shady Records recording artist Kxng Crooked aka Crooked I of Slaughterhouse recorded a tribute song for Garner titled \\"I Can't Breathe\\". The song was released exclusively through MTV News. Crooked used the same instrumental that was used for 2Pac's \\"Pain\\", with additional production added by Jonathan Hay. The cover art features an image of Garner being held in a chokehold by law enforcement officials. After the grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, professional athletes such as NFL players Reggie Bush, Ryan Davis, Cecil Shorts III, Marqise Lee, Ace Sanders, and Allen Hurns; and NBA players LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Garnett, Derrick Rose, Jarrett Jack, and Deron Williams, wore T-shirts bearing the phrase \\"I can't breathe\\" during pregame warmups. The Phoenix Suns also wore the shirts. President Obama and Attorney General Holder applauded James for wearing the shirt. The Georgetown University men's basketball team wore \\"I can't breathe\\" shirts, as did the University of Notre Dame Women's Basketball team. Realizing that Garner died the same way as Radio Raheem, a character from the film Do the Right Thing, film director Spike Lee also paid tribute to Garner by splicing footage of Garner's death with a clip from the film showing several police officers putting the character in a chokehold. The title of Terence Blanchard's 2015 album Breathless was inspired by Garner's last words (\\"I can't breathe\\"). Matt Taibbi wrote the 2017 book I Can't Breathe: A Killing on Bay Street. Civil lawsuit In October 2014, Garner's family stated their intent to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of New York, the police department, and several police officers, seeking $75 million in damages. The parties reached a $5.9 million out-of-court settlement on July 13, 2015. Garner's widow had previously rejected a $5 million settlement offer. Department of Justice investigation On December 3, 2014, after the grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo, the Department of Justice started an independent investigation. In January 2015 it was reported that the FBI's New York Field Office was reviewing the incident and events thereafter. The investigation was overseen by local United States Attorney Loretta Lynch until she became the US Attorney General. The local FBI investigators and federal prosecutors determined that charges should not be brought in the case, prompting strong disagreement from attorneys in the Washington, D.C. office of the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. In October 2016, Attorney General Lynch removed the local FBI agents and federal prosecutors from the case, replacing them with agents from outside New York. Lynch's intervention has been called \\"highly unusual\\". In 2017, ThinkProgress obtained anonymously and published Pantaleo's police department disciplinary records, showing that Pantaleo had \\"seven disciplinary complaints and 14 individual allegations lodged against him. Four of those allegations were substantiated by an independent review board.\\" He was found guilty of one of those fourteen allegations, and was disciplined by the loss of two vacation days. On July 16, 2019, Attorney General William Barr decided that the officers involved in Garner's death would not face federal charges. Disciplinary hearing and termination of Pantaleo An internal affairs inquiry by the NYPD determined that Pantaleo used a chokehold and recommended disciplinary charges. Chokeholds are prohibited by NYPD regulations, though are not illegal, per se, unless constituting assault or criminal homicide. In 2015, the Department of Justice asked the NYPD to delay pursuing disciplinary charges pending a federal investigation. On July 16, 2018, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Lawrence Byrne wrote a letter to the Justice Department stating that the NYPD would pursue disciplinary actions against officers involved in Garner's death if the Justice Department did not file charges by the end of August. During an April 4, 2019, disciplinary hearing Pantaleo's attorneys argued that in an internal report dated December 10, 2014, NYPD Chief Surgeon Eli Kleinman concluded Pantaleo did not use a chokehold on Garner and Garner had suffered no chokehold associated injuries. According to Pantaleo's lawyer, Kleinman found that Garner's pre-existing health conditions contributed to his death. The report was completed at the request of NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau. Kleinman did not personally examine Garner and based his conclusions on a review of two videos of the incident and Garner's autopsy. At a May 2019 disciplinary hearing for Pantaleo, Dr. Floriana Persechino, who performed Garner's autopsy, testified that Pantaleo's use of a chokehold on Garner \\"set into motion a lethal sequence\\" that led to a fatal asthma attack. However, the examiner conceded that even \\"a bear hug\\" could have had the same effect as the chokehold, given that Garner weighed 395 pounds (179 kg), suffered from asthma and diabetes, and had a heart twice the size of a healthy person's heart. Moreover, during the trial at a hearing in June 2019, a defense witness, Dr. Michael Graham, St. Louis, Missouri's chief medical examiner, testified Garner's death couldn't have been caused by a chokehold because, Graham said, Garner was never actually choked or unable to breathe during the arrest. Graham attributed Garner's death to heart disease exacerbated by the stress of the arrest. During this same trial, Pantaleo's partner, Justin D'Amico, admitted that he exaggerated Garner's charges. D'Amico claimed Garner had been selling 10,000 untaxed cigarettes, which was a felony. However, Garner had fewer than 100 cigarettes in his possession at the time of his death. Pantaleo's disciplinary hearing concluded on June 6, 2019. Two months later, it was reported that the administrative judge presiding over the disciplinary hearing recommended to New York Police Department Commissioner James O‚ÄôNeill that Pantaleo be fired. According to New York Police Department Administrative Judge Rosemarie Maldonado, video evidence and autopsy results provided \\"'overwhelming'\\" evidence that Pantaleo had placed Garner in a chokehold. In her recommendation to the Commissioner, Judge Maldonado found that Pantaleo's \\"'use of a chokehold fell so far short of objective reasonableness that this tribunal found it to be reckless ‚Äî a gross deviation from the standard of conduct established for a New York City police officer.'\\" On August 19, 2019, O'Neill terminated Pantaleo's employment with the New York Police Department, stating that it would not be possible for Pantaleo to serve effectively, and that Pantaleo's decision to maintain the chokehold on the ground is what led to his firing. Pantaleo's attorney, Stuart London, told reporters that his client planned to sue in state court for his reinstatement. State legislation On June 8, 2020, both houses of the New York state assembly passed the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, which stipulates that any police officer in the state of New York who injures or kills somebody through the use of \\"a chokehold or similar restraint\\" can be charged with a class C felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the police reforms, which he described as \\"long overdue\\", into law on June 12, 2020.  Popular culture  The single Loyal Like Sid & Nancy by Foster the People, released in 2017, includes the lyric \\"I can't breathe\\" and is partly a commentary about Garner's killing and Black Lives Matter. In 2018, a crime- drama film was released under the title of Monsters and Men, whose main plotline depicts the death of a cigarette-selling black man at the hands of the police being filmed by an onlooker and grabbing wide attention upon release. Being inspired by a real story, and given the striking similarity with the incident, multiple film reviews considered the movie to be based on the death of Eric Garner.

Fischer (1838 or 1839 in Dresden, Saxony ‚Äì September 23, 1898 in Silverton, Colorado) published six detailed maps of the San Juan area of southwestern Colorado between 1883 and 1898. A surveyor‚Äôs son, he came to America around 1872. He moved to Durango in 1880 when the building of the Denver & Rio Grande Railway to the San Juan attracted widespread attention,Montezuma Journal, Cortez, Colorado, September 30, 1898, page 4 then to Silverton. These maps aided silver and gold prospectors to file their claims; they enabled investors to locate mines and view their proximity to famous neighboring mines; and they encouraged tourists to visit the depicted mining regions and invigorate the local economies. This quiet, unobtrusive German immigrant made many mountain-climbing pilgrimages for his meticulous drawings of San Juan and adjacent counties, which he subsequently transferred to mapsFreda Carley Peterson, The Story of Hillside Cemetery, Silverton, San Juan County, Colorado, Volume 1, A-L, Revised (Silverton, CO: San Juan County Historical Society, 1966), p. F-10 that were as attractive as they were functional. Fischer drew his finished maps, even the text elements, entirely by handNote attached to image of Fischer‚Äôs 1886 map on rare-map dealer Barry Ruderman‚Äôs website before engraving and printing, distinguishing them from the typeset variety that came before and after. They are scrupulously correct in detail and were regarded as authoritative for many years. The complex terrain of the San Juan area, characterized by precipitous peaks ranging from 11,000 to 14,000 feet, rugged passes, deep gorges, alpine valleys, and glacial basins, rendered accurate maps indispensable for miners and created a niche for this cartographer. Following are descriptions of Fischer‚Äôs six maps: 1\\\\. 1883, ‚ÄúMap of the San Juan Mining Districts.‚Äù It includes insets with plats of the towns of Durango, Silverton, and Rico. The scale is one inch to three miles. 2\\\\. 1886, ‚ÄúMap of Red Mountain and the Mining Region of San Juan, Ouray, San Miguel and Dolores Counties.‚Äù A small inset shows the system of wagon roads connecting the towns of Telluride and Ouray with Montrose. The scale is one inch to one mile. 3\\\\. 1891, ‚ÄúMap of Red Mountain and the Mining Region of San Juan, Ouray, San Miguel and Dolores Counties,‚Äù intended to update its predecessor with the identical name and scale. Inset plats focus on these three mining locales: Newman Hill at Rico, the Red Mountain Area north of Silverton, and Silver Lake in Arrastra Basin, east of Silverton.

Using footage, costumes and props from Japanese 37th Super Sentai Series Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger, it is the first season to be distributed by Saban Brands Entertainment Group after the formation of two new units within the company called Saban Brands Lifestyle Group and Saban Brands Entertainment Group on December 11, 2014. The show is produced by SCG Power Rangers and began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2015, ending on December 12. It also went broadcast on Pop in 2018. Broadcast from May 25, 2015 on Canal J. From June 9, 2015 on Gulli. The second season, and twenty-third overall, is called Power Rangers Dino Super Charge and premiered on January 30, 2016, ending on December 12. Plot summary =Season 1: Dino Charge= Sixty-five million years ago, a dinosaur-like alien named Keeper was pursued through the galaxy by Sledge, an intergalactic bounty hunter bent on acquiring ten magical stones called the Energems in Keeper's care and using them to conquer the universe. Keeper crash landed on prehistoric Earth, entrusting the gems to many dinosaurs for safe-keeping and crippled Sledge's ship with a bomb that left the bounty hunter stranded in deep space. Unfortunately, Sledge's collection of asteroids held in a tractor beam accidentally rained down on prehistoric Earth and ultimately caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. In the present day, Keeper is found by archaeologist Kendall Morgan and they set up a base under the Amber Beach Dinosaur Museum in the city of Amber Beach. They begin a mission to find the Energems, but five have already been found by teenagers, who use them to morph into the Dino Charge Power Rangers. The group consists of the Red Ranger, Tyler Navarro, the adventurous leader of the group who is searching for his father who disappeared ten years ago on an archaeological dig; the Pink Ranger, Shelby Watkins, a waitress with a vast knowledge of dinosaurs; the Blue Ranger, Koda, a Cro-Magnon man living in modern times as he found his Energem in his tribe's cave, and was kept in suspended animation until the present day; the Green Ranger, Riley Griffin, the youngest of the group who is a skilled fencing swordsman; and the Black Ranger, Chase Randall, the suave and laid-back New Zealander. With these powers, the Dino Charge Power Rangers fight against Sledge, Poisandra, Fury, Wrench, Curio, and their prison full of monsters in order to find the remaining Energems and protect Earth. As time goes by, the Rangers are joined by additional teammates with additional Dino Zords: the Gold Ranger, Sir Ivan, an eight-hundred-year-old knight from Zandar who was trapped in the body of Sledge's minion Fury and the Graphite Ranger Prince Philip III of Zandar, the modern day crown prince of Ivan's home country. Kendall takes over the position of the Purple Ranger from Albert Smith who abandons the position due to his fears of Fury's minions. New threats also emerge, including the human-like villain, Heckyl. =Season 2: Dino Super Charge= The Ranger team gets two new members: the Aqua Ranger, who is revealed to be Tyler's long lost father James and the Silver Ranger, who is revealed to be Zenowing, a follower and apprentice of Keeper. However, with new powers come new enemies in the form of Singe, a mysterious warrior who arrives on Earth and quickly steps in as Heckyl's number two, much to Fury's anger. However, Heckyl starts to get curious when he realizes that Singe knows more about the Energems than he admits. After the Rangers discover the location of the Titano Zord, Heckyl demands to know how Singe knew its location, only for Singe to flee and return to Earth with the person who hired him named Lord Arcanon, who holds the evil Dark Energem. It was Lord Arcanon who hired Sledge to bring him the galaxy's most dangerous monsters to make an army out of them. Arcanon's reign ends with the return of Sledge who destroys his former employer with Snide (who was split from Heckyl) before Sledge betrays him and let the Rangers destroyed Snide too and takes back leadership of his crew. At that time, Heckyl regains all of his memories as a good person, which he lost from the Dark Energem. The Rangers went back in time and destroyed Sledge and his crew in the past. After their enemies' destruction, the Rangers go their separate ways as Koda and Ivan finally go back to their own times, Heckyl becomes the guardian of the Dark Energem as he and Zenowing return to Sentai 6, and Keeper returns to his home planet. The present day Rangers arrive back to their own time and find that it is a zoo and there are live dinosaurs since Sledge's asteroids never hit Earth and the extinction of the dinosaurs never came to pass.

It entered the Louvre's collection in 1861, with the purchase of Giampietro Campana's collection (Inv. E 874). This masterpiece, which is decorated with gorgons, is the source of the name the anonymous painter who decorated it and is therefore known as the Gorgon Painter.It was John Beazley (1885-1970), art historian and pioneer of the study of Greek pottery who first used this name.  Origin  The dinos, a banqueting vessel of large dimensions in which water was mixed into the wine, consisted of two parts: the bowl and the stand for it to rest on. The whole ensemble only rarely survives, but is the inspiration for examples in bronze which are encountered more often. While there is no doubt that this example was made in an Athenian workshop, the location of its discovery remains uncertain, though the fact that it was in Campana's collection suggests that it was acquired in clandestine excavations in Etruria. It is very unlikely that it was discovered in Greece.  Painted decoration  Detail: upper register, a winged Gorgon The ceramic ensemble is decorated in the black figure style, with ochre highlights and incisions outlining the images. The greater part of the decoration is made up of a palmette frieze with intertwined animals in the Corinthian tradition. The well-shaped stand is covered in friezes showing many different animals, like lions, cows, deer, along with fantastic creatures like sirens and sphinxes. The vase itself is decorated with three registers, one on top of the other. The lowest register begins with a spiral on the rounded bottom of the vase and develops into four rows of animals, while the central register is a band of interlaced palmettes. The uppermost register, the most interesting, is the earliest known example in archaic Greek pottery of an entirely figurative and narrative frieze. It depicts a scene from Greek mythology: Perseus fleeing the gorgons after he killed their sister, Medusa. The other two figures in the scene are Hermes, who can be identified by his petasus hat, and a woman who is presumably Athena. On the other side, there is a battle scene between several hoplites in chariots. Detail: upper register, Perseus pursued by the Gorgon The artist who decorated the vase, whose name is not known, was a student of the Nessos Painter, the most ancient representative of the Attic black figure tradition. According to Martine Denoyelles, he also got the Gorgon theme from the Nessos Painter, but \\"with this entirely narrative frieze, stripped of all decorative elements, the Gorgon painter announce the blooming of Attic production, which increasingly disengaged itself from Corinthian influence in the second quarter of the sixth century BC.Martine Denoyelles, Chefs-d'≈ìuvre de la c√©ramique grecque dans les collections du Louvre, √âd. de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, 1994, p. 58.  Other ancient dinoi  The British Museum possesses two remarkable dinoi of the painter and potter Sophilos, who was the first Attic potter to sign his works. On the stands of these two dinoi, c. 580 BC, the marriage of Peleus and Thetis is depicted in black figure style. These examples show the same Corinthian influence which is found on the works of the Gorgon Painter in his decoration of the vases with various kinds of animals. However, the stands are much larger and the vases are proportionately much smaller.Dinos of Sophilos on the website of the British Museum  Notes   See also  *Photos and bibliography of the dinos on The Beazley archives website Category:Individual ancient Greek vases Category:Greek, Etruscan and Roman antiquities of the Louvre Category:Greek mythology Category:Archaeological discoveries in Italy ","title":"Dinos of the Gorgon Painter"},{"id":"43345889","title":"Salsa Tequila"},{"id":"43345898","text":"A pyrrhic is a metrical foot used in formal poetry.

Los Angeles: University of California Press, 596 p. Hanson's central argument is that the Greeks who farmed the countrysides of the Greek Archaic period (\\"the Other Greeks\\") are responsible for the rise of representative governments, promotion of the middle class, amateur militias composed of citizens, and other values of Western Culture, not the widely written about Greek intelligentsia. Hanson aims to connect the rises and falls of varying governments to the degree to which homesteading is a widespread practice among the populace. Summary Hanson argues that the Archaic Greek city-state or polis was an institution that grew out of the intensive farming of Greek countryside at the end of Greek Dark Ages. During Archaic Greece, the Greek yeomen had roughly the same amount of land, the same interests, and the same purchasing power. It is this group of free farmers who work their own land in mass that create the constitutional governments of the poleis (city-states). These poleis then primarily functioned to foster the practice of intensive farming by the voting class. At the end of Archaic period and the beginning of Classical times, the veneration of individuality and equality had destroyed the very system of government it created. The book is divided into three sections: 1 - The Rise of The Small Farmer in Ancient Greece, 2 - The Preservation of Agrarianism, and 3 - To Lose a Culture. =Part One= Part one discusses post- Mycenean Greece (1100 BC). Hanson argues that after the fall of Mycenean Greece, that Greece was decentralized, and people in an effort to feed themselves, turned to homesteading. Documents from the time show that the size of the Greek yeoman farm was roughly equal. This rough equality in farm size translated to a rough equality in material wealth and created a citizenry neither poor nor wealthy but situated in the middle of their society. Additionally, the daily struggle of the small farmer against nature created a shared sense of comradery among the yeomen due to the similarity of their experiences. =Part Two= Part two of the book discusses the development of the polis. Hanson suggests that the common culture of farming shared by the \\"Other Greeks\\" led them to create a government that protected their interests. In the Greek polis, landed yeomen were typically the only citizens who could vote. As such, these \\"middling farmers\\" determined the laws of the polis in times of peace and decided when the polis would wage war. Hanson uses evidence of short warfare duration and the fact that wars typically occurred in the agricultural downtime of August to suggest that the hoplites were Greek yeomen farmers. =Part Three= Part three scrutinizes the decline of the egalitarian polis culture which occurred around 500 - 300 BC and is associated with Classical Greece. Hanson argues that an increase in wealth disparity drove the destruction of the egalitarian \\"polis\\" in Greece. Wealth disparity manifested itself in unequal plots of land and differential taxation. Marginal lands, i.e. many of the lands that Greek homesteads were located on, could not produce enough food to be viable in subsistence agricultural practice under the heavy taxes of the Classical period. This forced many yeomen off of their farms and potentially into serfdom. This precipitated the destruction of a form of government in which the voter also is a legislative representative, warrior, and farmer. Publication history The book was first published in 1995 by the University of California Press. A second edition updated with a preface and a recent bibliography of the works of Victor Davis Hanson was published in 1999.  Reception and influence The Other Greeks has been called a masterpiece as well as a foundation for understanding the polis.Rahe PA (1997) The Other Greeks: The Family Farm and the Agrarian Roots of Western Civilization. Review by Paul Rahe. The American Journal of Philology, 118(3):459-462 While reviewers do discuss shortcomings such as failing to discuss the effect of slavery on polis culture, or an overstatement of the case that agrarianism was the only common thread in Archaic Greece,http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/1996/96.02.11.html reviews are generally positive.

World of Speed was initially planned as a free-to-play and to be released in 2014. In January 2017 the developers closed the community forums and released a statement that the game was \\"not yet good enough for our players\\" and that \\"the project will be under-going a substantial revision\\". In August 2017, the game was rereleased on Steam as an Early Access title however on November 13th 2018 in an announcement on Steam, World of Speed was to shut down its servers on December 25th.  Gameplay  World of Speed offers both a solo-player based and a team-based gameplay, in which two teams vie for control of real world circuits and street locations in London, Moscow and Monaco to start. The game features a free for all format with destructible open environments and no rules. Players create or join clubs with others and compete in two versus two or four versus four battles to accomplish the maximum point value and conquer the area. In World of Speed, players earn rewards for successfully completing challenges including clean turns and drafting other cars, in addition to finishing first. These rewards can later be used to upgrade cars and become more competitive in the next event. The game requires offensive and defensive tactics, as each player can track the challenges of rival vehicles and may slam into them to prevent their success. The game is planned to ever-expand its car range. The different cars vastly ranges from everyday rides, tuners, exotics, muscle cars to fast supercars with hefty performance. It is also officially announced that there will be car customization, both in looks and performance. The custom garages and customization options give players tools to build exactly what they want. A variety of load-outs will be available for numerous car models, with new parts and items awarded as players earn more experience during the races. Players who play as a club can get to a stage where if they have enough winnings, they can customize their own track to host races on. The track can be set up with different logos and emblems for the specific racing club. The game's initial racing modes are Circuit, Sprint, Drag and Drift stages, including social in-game events such as Clubs where players and teams can communicate and compete in different types of team-based gameplay modes. Players who achieve a certain level in the game as a club gain ownership of the course. Locations can then be fought over in the team-based game mode such as Territory Wars. The Airfield is a non-competitive zone where players can show off theirs cars, meet with clubs, and take a look at the upgraded cars others are driving. Most of the racing tracks in World of Speed consist of different stages, with different levels of difficulty. Some parts/stages of each track have long straight high-speed roads, while others have more turns and elevation (e.g. mountain passes) and sharp hairpin turns. This is meant to encourage players to practice driving, and make them carefully think through the best driving styles and driving techniques, as well as the car of their choice. There are currently 15 racing tracks in World of Speed.

It was the most influential newspaper among Germans in Baltimore, lasting longer than any of the other German newspapers in Maryland.  History  Der Deutsche Correspondent was established in 1841 by Friedrich Raine, a member of a family of printers from Westphalia, Germany. Raine saw the need for a German-language newspaper in a city populated by a large number of Germans and established the newspaper at the age of 19. The paper started out with only eight subscribers, but circulation numbers climbed and quickly overtook two other German newspapers in Baltimore. During the 1880s and 1890s, its circulation reached about 15,000. Initially started as a weekly, the newspaper grew and eventually became a daily paper in 1848. The paper closed April 28, 1918, due to anti-German sentiment resulting from World War I. After the Correspondent closed, many of its employees began to work at Bayrische Wochenblatt, a newspaper that had been published in Baltimore since 1880. The two newspapers merged and became a German weekly, called the Baltimore Correspondent. Legacy In 2009 The Maryland Historical Society received a grant from the Charles Edward Hilgenberg Fund of the Baltimore Community Foundation to digitize Der Deutsche Correspondent. In March 2013 the University of Maryland Libraries announced that they would also be digitizing the Der Deutsche Correspondent.

She was one of the first women to attend Cairo University and in 1941 became the first Egyptian woman to earn her Master of Arts Degree and PhD for her work in Arabic literature. After graduating, she was employed by the university as their first woman lecturer. Al-Qalamawi was also one of the first women to hold a number of chief positions including chairperson of the Arabic Department at Cairo University, president of the Egyptian Feminist Union, and president of the League of Arab Women University Graduates. Her writings include two volumes of short stories, ten critical studies, and many translations from world literature.A·∏•ƒÅdƒ´th jaddatƒ´ (My Grandmother's Tales) was published in 1935. Biography =Early life= Suhayr al-Qalamawi was born on July 20, 1911 in Cairo, Egypt and lived there throughout her life. She was born to a family that took pride in educating its female members and therefore she was able to take advantage of her father's extensive library of works at an early age. Exposure to authors like Taha Hussein, Rifa'a al- Tahtawi, and Ibn Iyas helped advance her literary talent and shape her voice as a writer. As a child during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, al-Qalamawi grew up with influences from the Egyptian women at the time including legendary feminist Huda Sha'arawi and nationalist figure Safia Zaghoul. These women and other feminists at the time focused on moving feminist debate into the streets to create a more far reaching movement. This goal influenced some of al-Qalamawi's feminist ideals. =Education= In 1928, al-Qalamawi graduated the American College for girls and intended to study medicine like her father at Cairo University. However, upon receiving a rejection, she was encouraged by her father to instead specialize in Arabic Literature. She became the first young girl to attend Cairo University and the only female among fourteen males to study Arabic Literature. During her time at Cairo University, al-Qalamawi received guidance from Dr. Taha Hussein who was the chairperson of the Arabic Department and editor in chief of the Cairo University Magazine. He made al-Qalamawi the assistant editor of the Cairo University Magazine in 1932 and thus al-Qalamawi became the first woman with a license in journalism in Egypt. During her years as a student, she was also a broadcaster for the Egyptian Radio Broadcasting service. After earning her Masters of Arts degree, she received a scholarship to do research in Paris for her PhD. In 1941, after completing her thesis, she became the first woman to receive a PhD from Cairo University. =Career= She was a woman of many ‚Äúfirsts‚Äù and began her career as the first woman lecturer at Cairo University in 1936. She soon worked her way up to professor and later chairperson of the Arabic Department between the years 1958-1967 and was the first woman to do so. She served as the president of the Egyptian Feminist Union and in 1959, she became the head of the League of Arab Women University Graduates where she set the basis of cooperation between the Egyptian Union and the World Union of Universities. Later, she was the head of the Egyptian General Authority for Cinema, Theater, and Music in 1967 and the head of the Children's Culture Community in 1968. Al-Qalamawi contributed to the fight for women's rights not only through literary works, but also through her participation in Arab Women's Conferences where she advocated for equal rights. In 1960, she was the president of the International Conference on Woman; by 1961 she was the head of the first conference on Folkloric Arts. She established a committee to superintend the university Palestinian girls to address her concern of the Palestinian issue in 1962. Her political career began when she entered the political arena as a member of parliament in 1958 until 1964 and again in 1979 until 1984. She was also the director of the government affiliated Egyptian Organization for Publishing and Distributing where she worked to broaden the audience of readers, encourage young writers, and promote the book industry. In 1967, she established the Middle East's first international book fair: the Cairo International Book Fair. During her last few years, she served as the Head of the General Book Organization from 1967 to 1971 and president of the Board of Censorship from 1982 to 1985. Starting as early as 1935, she published a wide array of literary works including short stories, critical studies, cultural magazines, and translations. She died in Cairo on May 4, 1997. Writing and themes Among her more than eighty publications, al- Qalamawi's earliest and most famous work is her first volume of short stories published in 1935. This work, which was published in Cairo, was also the first volume of short stories to be published by a woman in Egypt. In Ahadith Jaddati (My Grandmother‚Äôs Tales), al-Qalamawi analyzes the female social role as a preserver and renewer of community history through oral narrative in this work. The volume is framed by the story of a grandmother reminiscing about the past to her granddaughter. She develops this story line into a social criticism and vision of wartime form the perspective of the civilians who stayed home.Booth, Marilyn (2000). Translator's introduction to The grandmother extracts morals from her recollection of events and draws comparisons between the past and present, often favoring the past. Al-Qalamawi suggests through this work that old wives‚Äô tales and grandmothers‚Äô bedtime stories can contain a deep feminist message. Like many other works of fiction in the 1930s, her collection of stories provides realistic depictions of Egyptian middle class society and, through middle class eyes, a view of peasant society. The thesis that earned al-Qalamawi her PhD, a research paper on Alf Lailah wa Lailah (One Thousand and One Nights), lays the foundations of her feminist mission. She aims to create the new woman: an intelligent, cultured, and wise woman who is fully in charge of her life and family. This woman not only uses her wits and virtues to reach equality with men, but also strives to re-educate men in order to gain equality. This message was further developed in her books on literary criticism, ‚ÄúLimitation in Literature‚Äù (1955) and ‚ÄúThe World Between Two Bookcovers‚Äù (1958). Her translations of works such as Chinese stories by Pearl Buck (1950) and Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Taming of the Shrew‚Äù (1964) further illustrate women's struggles and the need to re-educate men. Al-Qalamawi also founded and released several cultural magazines that dealt with contemporary subjects such as cinema, music and the arts. Other significant works include ‚ÄúThe Devils Play and Dance‚Äù (1965), ‚ÄúThe Dissident‚Äôs Literature (1941), and ‚ÄúThe World in a Book‚Äù (1958). Her work has been received warmly by critics; many regard her as a \\"remarkable literary figure of the contemporary cultural movement in Egypt.\\" Tribute On July 20, 2014, Google dedicated a Doodle to the writer for the 103rd anniversary of her birth. The Doodle reached all the countries of the Arab World. Awards Al-Qalamawi received awards and recognition for her literary work, leadership, and advocacy. These awards include: #Award of the Arabic Language Academy, for her Ph.D. thesis on \\"Arabian Nights\\", 1945. #State Merit Award in Youths‚Äô Literature, she was the first woman to obtain it 1955. #State Encouragement Prize, 1955. #State Merit Award in Literature, shared with Dr. Shawki Deif, 1963. #Nasser's Award, dedicated by the former Soviet Union, 1976. #State Merit Award in Literature, 1977. #Medal of Appreciation, 1977. #Medal of the Republic, first class, 1978. #Medal of Achievement, 1978. #State Appreciation Prize for Literature #Honorary Doctorate from the American University in Cairo, (AUC), 1987.

United States Department of Agriculture  Smith grew up on a farm in Aurora, Nebraska with all the attendant tasks of farm life. Smith left home for what was then known as the State University at Lincoln. The State Entomologist, Lawrence Bruner, offered Smith a position as assistant. It was there that Smith met and later married Bruner's daughter, Psyche. Following Smith's graduation from the University of Nebraska in 1908, he was hired by Leland Ossian Howard to work at the USDA's Bureau of Entomology. During this time Smith held several assignments including the Boll Weevil Eradication Program, the Gypsy Moth Parasite Laboratory in Melrose Highlands, Massachusetts, and a 1912 collaboration in Italy with Filippo Silvestri to identify a natural predator to the alfalfa weevil. On the recommendation of his boss, Howard, Smith was selected by the California State Commissioner of Horticulture, A. J. Cook, to serve as Superintendent of the newly created State Insectary beginning January 1, 1913. In 1919 the State of California created the State Department of Agriculture with Smith the Chief of the Bureau of Pest Control. Eventually entomological research was stripped from the regulatory functions of the department and migrated to the University of California's College of Agriculture. Smith coined the term \\"biological control\\" in his 1919 article \\"On some phases of insect control by the biological method\\" for the Journal of Economic Entomology, referring to the reliance on the natural enemies of pests to effect control, as opposed to the use of pesticide.  University of California  With the transition of entomology research to the University of California Citrus Experiment Station in 1923, Smith's research division was refashioned as the Division of Beneficial Insect Investigations and Smith was appointed an associate professor at UCR where he remained until his retirement in 1951. The division would remain wholly apart from University of California's Entomology department until the department and its pair at University of California, Berkeley were closed in 1989. Thanks to his correspondence with Dr. A. J. Nicholson, the Chief Entomologist at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Smith initiated the first Federally- approved weed control program, the control of Klamath weed by importing insects from Australia. Smith also established the Laboratory of Insect Pathology, appointing Edward Arthur Steinhaus as its first head. In 1953, Smith's alma mater awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree. He died on 28 November 1957. Smith has been considered \\"a renowned researcher in the biological control of citrus pests for the University of California.\\"  Partial bibliography    Memorials  In 1967, UCR's Department of Biological Control established the Harry Scott Smith Award to recognize achievements in the biological control of insects. The first award went to Canadian scientist William Robin Thompson with a $1000 honorarium. A separate award for graduate students in biological control was established in 1966. The Harry S. Smith scholarship fund was established for students studying biological control, started with a $15,000 bequest from Smith for that purpose. The archives of Smith's papers are now stored with the Entomology Department of UCR.
