He is the absent-minded professor/scientist archetype in the franchise. History In the first unofficial Suske en Wiske story, Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije (1945), Wiske, Rikki and Tante Sidonia are aided by an absent-minded engineer called Ingenieur Wargaren. Vandersteen never used the character again, but he can be seen as a prototype of Barabas. Professor Barabas made his debut in the next and first official Suske en Wiske story, Het Eiland Amoras (\\"The Isle of Amoras\\") (1945). Wiske and Tante Sidonia meet him at the beach, after Wiske accidentally hit his head with a vase. Barabas turns out to be a professor who invented a large helicopter named the Gyronef, which allows them to travel to the isle of Amoras to solve a mystery.\\"Suske en Wiske: Het Eiland Amoras\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1945. The earliest version of Barabas differed a lot from later appearances. In \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\" he is very obese and has a stutter. After complaints from parents that their children imitated Barabas' stuttering, his stutter was 'healed'. Character Barabas is a good friend of the protagonists. They frequently ask for his help whenever they have a complicated problem that only his scientific knowledge can solve. Barabas' many inventions often drive the plot forward, despite the fact that he doesn't always play a huge role in the stories. In many cases he stays at home, especially when the characters time travel with his \\"teletijdmachine\\" (\\"tele time machine\\"), because he has to control the machine. Only in a few stories does he play a central role. In \\"De Gouden Cirkel\\" (\\"The Golden Circle\\") (1960) Barabas gets contaminated with radiation, causing his friends to travel across the entire globe to get him proper medicine. In \\"Beminde Barabas\\" (\\"Beloved Barabas\\") (1974) Barabas searches for a girl he loved when he was younger, but later lost contact with. Barabas is generally a good-natured, if somewhat absent-minded person. He enjoys playing pranks on his friends now and then by keeping his inventions a secret until their curiosity gets the better of them or by disguising himself. Only when the others bother him while he is busy does Barabas get angry. He can also get quite furious when his inventions are vandalized or misused. Barabas is also aware of his huge responsibility as a scientist. In \\"De Sprietatoom\\" (\\"The Tiny Atom\\") (1947) \\"Suske en Wiske: De Sprietatoom\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1947. he destroys his entire laboratory out of fear it will be misused by foreign military powers and becomes a poet. In \\"Barabas de Balorige\\" (2013) he destroys everything again, but travels to the past instead, \\"when times were more simple.\\".\\"Suske en Wiske: Barabas de Balorige\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 2013. In \\"De Snorrende Snor\\" (\\"The Purring Moustache\\") (1957) Barabas creates a huge scheme involving robots who threaten to destroy the world, only to bring the world a message of love instead.\\"Suske en Wiske: De Snorrende Snor\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1957. Barabas' name is obviously inspired by the biblical character Barabbas.Van Hooydonck, Peter, \\"Willy Vandersteen: De Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1995. Family background In \\"De Zeven Schaken\\" (1995) we see Barabas during his youth. He is raised by his stern, rich father who wants him to speak French and study. According to \\"De Hellegathonden\\" (\\"The Hellhounds\\") (1986) Barabas' great grandfather was a crook who was preoccupied with occult magic. He felt remorse, however, and changed his life for the better. Another 19th- century forefather of Barabas was Geronimous Jabbertalk, who was a scientist in London.\\"Suske en Wiske: De Kwakende Queen\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 2011. In \\"De Beminde Barabas\\" (1974) we learn that, as a young student, Barabas fell in love with a female tailor.\\"Suske en Wiske: Beminde Barabas\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1974. Despite being an innovative scientist Barabas was so poor in \\"Het Zingende Nijlpaard\\" (1950) (\\"The Singing Hippo\\").\\"Suske en Wiske: Het Zingende Nijlpaard\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1950. that he was forced to sell his inventions. By \\"De Glanzende Gletsjer\\" (\\"The Gleaming Glacier\\") (1986) his reputation is such that he is elected \\"Inventor of the Year\\".\\"Suske en Wiske: De Glanzende Gletsjer\\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1986. Inventions Barabas has invented many machines and vehicles, which often come to good use to Suske, Wiske, Lambik, Tante Sidonia and Jerom. Among the most recurring are: * De teletijdmachine (\\"The tele time machine\\"). Barabas' most famous invention. It was introduced in \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\", but only to view images from the past on a screen. From \\"De Tuf-Tuf-Club\\" (1952) the device is built into a huge machine which is able to teleport people to previous centuries or bring them to the present. Whenever the cast has to travel to a previous time period they use the tele time machine. In \\"De Duistere Diamant\\" (\\"The Dark Diamond\\") (1958) Barabas creates a bracelet with the same function. In \\"De Zeven Snaren\\" (\\"The Seven Strings\\") (1967), \\"Lambik Baba\\" (1991) and \\"Het Verdronken Land\\" (\\"The Drowned Country\\") (1999) a portable version of the machine is introduced. * The Gyronef. A huge helicopter, introduced in \\"Het Eiland Amoras\\" (\\"The Isle of Amoras\\") (1945). * The Terranef. A vehicle able to travel underground, introduced in \\"De Knokkersburcht\\" (\\"The Batterer's Castle\\") (1953) * Vitamitje. A small anthropomorphic car, suitable for Suske and Wiske to drive with. It was introduced in \\"De Sprietatoom\\" (\\"The Tiny Atom\\") (1946). * De Klankentapper (\\"The Noises Transmitter\\"). A machine which enables people to listen and communicate with plants and objects. In popular culture In the 1976 puppet TV series Cees van Oyen provided the voice of Barabas' puppet. In the 1994 musical \\"De Stralende Sterren\\" Alex Wilequet played the part of Barabas.http://suskeenwiske.ophetwww.net/musical/musical1.php In the 2004 live-action film ' Tuur De Weert played the part. Pierre Bokma provided the voice of the same character in the animated adaptation Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers (2009). In the Belgian Comic Strip Center in Brussels the permanent exhibition brings homage to the pioneers of Belgian comics, among them Willy Vandersteen. In the room dedicated to his work a replica of Professor Barabas' teletijdmachine (\\"tele time machine\\") can be seen.http://www.tento.be/sites/default/files/tijdschrift/pdf/OKV1992/Belgisch%20Centrum%20van%20het%20Beeldverhaal%20Brussel.pdf Sources Category:Spike and Suzy Category:Belgian comics characters Category:Fictional Belgian people Category:Comics characters introduced in 1945 Category:Fictional pranksters Category:Fictional professors Category:Fictional inventors Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional stutterers Category:Male characters in comics ","title":"Professor Barabas"},{"id":"43674064","text":"The Battle of Cze≈õniki took place on 21 and 22 September 1939 during the German and Soviet invasion of Poland, around the village of Cze≈õniki near Zamo≈õƒá.

It is one of the largest excavated ancient sites in the Amuq valley, in the plain of Antioch. Settlement at this site ranges from the Neolithic (6000 BC) through the Byzantine Period. Excavations The first excavations at Tell Judaidah began in the 1930s, conducted by the American archaeologist James Breasted of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.K. Aslihan Yener, The Amuq Valley Regional Project 1995-98, American Journal of Archaeology, v. 104, #2, 2000, p. 163. Excavations were continued by Robert Braidwood, and revealed the existence of human settlements in the Amuk valley in the Neolithic period as early as 6,000 BC. Rich discoveries of pottery helped to establish the sequence of successive ceramic shapes in the areas of the Eastern Mediterranean.Simone Mantellini, Regional approach and archaeological survey in Norther Syria. An overview, in: Ebla and its landscape. Early state formation in the ancient Near East, Paolo Matthiae i Nicolo Marchetti, eds. 2013, p. 240.

Demand, The Mediterranean Context of Early Greek History, 2011. Excavations in 1995 revealed the remains of a thick (1.5 m) wall of mud bricks on stone foundations, dating to the fourth millennium BC. Very early bronze statuettes were discovered here dating to the period of 3400-2750 BC. These are known as 'Amuq G figurines'.

The first charge of the indictment was abuse of official capacity, a first-degree felony, for threatening to veto $7.5 million in funding for the Public Integrity Unit, a state public corruption prosecutors department. The second charge, which has since been ruled unconstitutional, was coercion of a public servant, a third-degree felony, for seeking the resignation of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, after she was convicted of drunk driving and incarcerated. Lehmberg was a district attorney in Travis County, Texas, and the Travis County DA's office managed the Public Integrity Unit's operations. The veto was seen as retribution for Lehmberg not stepping down. Perry pleaded not guilty to both charges. On July 24, 2015, the Texas Third Court of Appeals dismissed the indictment for coercion of a public official on the basis that the indictment violated Perry's First Amendment rights to free speech. The indictment for abuse of power, a charge which his lawyers said is a misdemeanor, was likewise dismissed, in February 2016.Ex Parte Perry, PD-1067-15, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (February 24, 2016). Indictment According to the complaint from Texans for Public Justice that led to the indictment, at the time of the veto, prosecutors in the Texas Public Integrity Unit had been investigating a state agency called the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, described by The New York Times as \\"one of Perry‚Äôs signature initiatives [that] came under scrutiny by state lawmakers after accusations of mismanagement and corruption.\\" According to Texas Democrats, if Perry could, he would appoint a Republican district attorney and hinder the investigation. According to officials in Perry's office, Lehmberg was offered a job at the DA's office and Perry offered to appoint her top lieutenant, a Democrat, as district attorney. Perry was never a target of the probe according to an affidavit by the investigator on the case. Texas Democrats have said that Perry didn't oppose other elected officials who were convicted of drunk driving in Texas. Republicans say that none of the other elected officials were responsible for an office responsible for the ethics and integrity of public officials. Billy Ray Stubblefield, chief judge of Texas' Third Judicial District, presides over the case. Michael McCrum was appointed special prosecutor by Bert Richardson, a former judge of the 379th District Court in Bexar County and the incoming 2015 Place 3 judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Richardson had been selected by Judge Stubblefield to handle the grand jury investigation. Jay Root of the Texas Tribune said \\"Lehmberg and other Travis County officials recused themselves from the case and are not prosecuting it\\" noting that the prosecutor was appointed by Bert Richardson, a \\"Republican judge\\". Response Rick Perry's supporters called the charges political and partisan, and several Democratic commentators, including David Axelrod, Jonathan Prince, Matthew Yglesias, and Jonathan Chait have stated that they believe the charges were either weak or unwarranted. Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz stated that \\"The two statutes under which Gov. Perry was indicted are reminiscent of the old Soviet Union ‚Äî you know, abuse of authority. The idea of indicting him because he threatened to veto spending unless a district attorney who was caught drinking and driving resigned, that's not anything for a criminal indictment. That's a political issue.\\" He added, \\"it's so important to put a stop to it now, to say the criminal law is reserved for real crimes, not for political differences where a party in power or out of power gets revenge against the other party. That's just not the way to use the criminal justice [system].\\"ABA Journal Dershowitz: Gov. Perry‚Äôs indictment is an example of ‚Äòcriminalization of party differences‚Äô , By Debra Cassens Weiss Aug 18, 2014 7:56 AM CDT On August 16, 2014, Perry called the indictment a political move and an abuse of power, and vowed to fight the charges. The Texas Democratic Party asked Perry to resign. Major newspapers including The New York Times (\\"appears to be the product of an overzealous prosecution\\"), The Los Angeles Times (\\"the courts are the wrong place to settle political scores\\"), The Washington Post (\\"The grand jury, however, would criminalize Mr. Perry‚Äôs conduct by twisting the pertinent statutes into a pair of pretzels\\"), and USA Today (\\"Politics as usual should not be a violation of criminal law\\") criticized the indictment. Is Gov. Rick Perry‚Äôs Bad Judgment Really a Crime? The New York Times, By THE EDITORIAL BOARD, AUG. 18, 2014 The Dallas Morning News editorially said that the key question for the jury to decide after hearing all the evidence is ‚Äú[d]id our governor violate state law in how and why he withheld that funding?‚Äù Eugene Volokh, UCLA School of Law professor, writing in the Washington Post said that the Texas Constitution gives Perry the right to veto bills and he cannot be prosecuted for using his lawful and constitutional authority as Texas Governor. Volokh said Perry's statements in the media threatening the veto are protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and cited the Texas Courts of Appeals's case State v. Hansen as support for the First Amendment protection of Perry, where the court stated, \\"Coercion of a lawful act by a threat of lawful action is protected free expression\\". Other news reports, however, have highlighted the fact that that additional district attorneys in Texas, who were Republican, had also been charged with DUI's during his governorship and against whom Perry took no similar action as he directed against the Democrat, Lehmberg, of Travis county. A spokesman for Rick Perry said, however, \\"They were not in charge of the Public Integrity Unit, which receives state taxpayer dollars...we don‚Äôt have any evidence that they behaved as inappropriately and abusively to law enforcement as Lehmberg did.\\" Defense On August 19, 2014, Perry arrived at the Travis County jail where he was processed, photographed for his mug shot, finger printed, and released. Perry pleaded not guilty, and waived arraignment. On August 25, attorneys for Perry filed a writ of habeas corpus application in state district court in Austin to dismiss the felony charges against him. Perry hired former Clinton White House special counsel Mark Fabiani, GOP attorney Bobby Burchfield, defense lawyer David Botsford, Republican lawyer Ben Ginsberg, former Texas Supreme Court Justice Tom Phillips, and former McCain/Palin consultant Steve Schmidt to help him with legal issues and strategy around the indictment. Leading the team was Houston trial lawyer and Texas A&M; University Regent Tony Buzbee.http://www.texastribune.org/2014/08/18/perrys-attorneys-address- indictment/ On September 8, 2014, in the second motion to dismiss the charges brought against the governor, lawyers for Perry referenced French King Louis XIV. Perry's lawyers stated that Perry has \\"no more has custody or possession of the State's general revenue funds than does any Texan. No governor can say of his or her state what the Sun King said of France: \\"L'etat c'est moi.\\" On October 3, 2014, Perry's lawyers filed another motion to have the charges dismissed, arguing that Lehmberg did not file a motion to have herself recused from the case and there was never an order from a judge recusing her from the case, contrary to the requirements of Texas state law. Also, Perry's lawyers argued that McCrum did not file the documentation that McCrum was required to file to take the oath of office. On the oath of office form from McCrum, McCrum's signature was missing and it was signed by Judge Richardson instead of McCrum. A state district judge rejected this motion to dismiss in November, while leaving all other motions to quash and writs still pending. On January 28, 2015, District Judge Bert Richardson of San Antonio again ruled that Perry's motion to quash and dismiss the indictment \\"does not challenge the sufficiency of the indictment.\\" Special prosecutor Michael Crum has stated that the case is stronger than it may outwardly appear, and that it should be heard by a jury. On February 13, 2015, special prosecutors Mike McCrum and David Gonzalez, amended the indictment to fill out their argument that Perry's action was illegal.Prosecutors Lift Veil on Perry's Alleged Crimes Texas Tribune. 13 February 2015. Further developments in 2015 In a survey conducted by Public Policy Polling (PPP) in Iowa a week after the indictment, Perry‚Äôs net favorability rating among Republicans went up 7 percentage points. The Third Court of Appeals considered an interlocutory appeal of a decision by the trial judge to not throw out the case.Svitek, Patrick. \\"Indictment Cuts Both Ways as Perry Launches Bid\\", The Texas Tribune (June 3, 2015).Morris, Angela. \\"Perry Pays Defense Lawyers Another $1.2 million\\", Texas Lawyer (July 16, 2015). On July 24, 2015, the Texas Third Court of Appeals dismissed the indictment for coercion of a public official, on the basis that the indictment violates his First Amendment rights to free speech. The more serious indictment for abuse of power remained against Perry, carrying a potential prison sentence of five to 99 years, and was later dismissed in February 2016 by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. =Mugshot photo= A Political Action Committee supporting Perry, RickPAC, used Perry's mugshot on a 25 T-shirt to raise money, the front featuring Perry‚Äôs mugshot with a stamp that says \\"WANTED for securing the border and defeating Democrats\\", and on the back featuring Lehmberg‚Äôs mugshot with the caption \\"GUILTY for driving while intoxicated and perversion of justice.\\" The mugshot went viral when it was released and people added their own touches and overlays to the photo in social media. Dismissal of all charges in 2016 The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed all charges in February 2016.Morris, Angela. \\"Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Dismisses Former Governor Rick Perry's Criminal Case\\", Texas Lawyer (February 24, 2016). The court was divided 6-2, and its majority opinion by Presiding Judge Sharon Keller was accompanied by two concurring opinions and two dissents. The court dismissed the abuse-of-official-capacity charge, and upheld the earlier dismissal of the coercion-of-a-public-servant charge. The former charge was dismissed under the separation of powers provision of the Texas Constitution, a provision which the court interpreted as forbidding prosecution of a governor for his veto, using the abuse-of- official-capacity statute. As to the latter charge, the court agreed with the lower court that it would violate the free speech principles in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution if a governor who threatens a veto is prosecuted using the coercion-of-a-public-servant statute. The court also addressed the procedural question of whether Perry could make his separation- of-powers argument in a pretrial habeas corpus application, followed by an interlocutory appeal (i.e. an appeal before the end of the lower court proceedings). On this question, the court said: \\"The nature of the constitutional right at issue entitles him to raise these claims by pretrial habeas corpus.\\" The previous understanding had been that a defendant seeking pretrial habeas relief had to successfully argue that a statute was facially unconstitutional, rather than unconstitutional as applied (which was Perry's argument). According to the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Congress cannot limit the veto power of the U.S. president, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals here decided that the same principle applies to the governor. Thus, said the court, the Texas Legislature cannot turn a veto into a crime: \\"When the only act that is being prosecuted is a veto, then the prosecution itself violates separation of powers,\\" wrote Judge Keller. This dismissal ended the abuse-of- power accusations that had detrimentally affected Perry's unsuccessful campaign for president in 2015.Fernandez, Manny. \\"Texas Court Dismisses Criminal Case Against Rick Perry\\", The New York Times (February 24, 2016).

History The manor was a privileged noble estate (seteg√•rd) until the 1821 Nobility Law abolished this privilege in the 19th century,Axel Coldevin, Norske storg√•rder, pp. 24‚Äì26, 1950 and was notably owned by the Norwegian chancellor Jens Bjelke and his descendants. It once included the main estate and 13 other farms, as well as 11 sawmills. Over time, much of the agricultural land was sold, but the manor's economic importance rested chiefly on its sawmills. The manor and its surroundings have been painted by several prominent painters. Following a visit by Crown Prince Regent Frederick in 1788, he sent Erik Pauelsen to paint the view from the manor. Other artists who visited the manor and painted motifs from Veden include Jens Peter M√∏ller, Heinrich Grosch, Ferdinand Gj√∏s, Thomas Fearnley, and Johannes Flintoe. During the Swedish‚ÄìNorwegian War in 1814, Swedish Crown Prince Carl Johan stayed at the manor. The owner, the widow Ziegler, was forced to have him as a guest. Carl Johan wanted to buy the manor, but found the price too high. In 1851, the manor was sold to foundry master Johannes Petterson, and some years later, it was sold to a consortium of sawmill and land owners who formed the Sawmill Corporation in 1859, a trust that became the largest sawmill company in Norway. The manor house was then used by various directors of the company. Veden Manor was owned by the Sawmill Corporation and its successor Norske Skog until around 2000.Norl√∏ff, H.

D'Urbano's most notable work was 1995's \\"hautnah\\" (close to the skin); a series of garments imprinted with life-size digital photographs of her own skin. After an exhibition in 1999, critics stated she depicted nudity as fashionable, provoked voyeurism, and made skin (the external body) just another interface in a world. In addition to her own work, D'Urbano has been a critic and an art philosopher. Since 1995, D'Urbano has been a professor at Hochschule f√ºr Grafik und Buchkunst, in Leipzig, Germany.  Early life  D'Urbano was born in Tivoli and studied philosophy at the Sapienza University of Rome from 1974 to 1978. Her work as an artist was influenced by her affiliation with the 'Distracted Avantgarde' (Klemens Gruber), which sought to bring about a paradigm shift in the relationship between art, politics and mass communication. It was against this backdrop that Alba D'Urbano produced experimental radio programmes for the alternative broadcasting station Radio Gulliver in Tivoli (modelled on stations such as Radio Alice in Bologna and Radio Citt√† Futura in Rome) and founded a feminist group.Klemens Gruber: Die zerstreute Avantgarde. Strategische Kommunikation im Italien der 70er Jahre, B√∂hlau-Verlag, Vienna 2010. In 1979, she enrolled in a course of visual arts studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome under Enzo Brunori, graduating in 1983. Experimental works in collaboration with other artists date from that period. One such fellow artist was composer Alessandro Cipriani with whom she created performances, Super-8 films, and artistic events in public spaces. Alba D'Urbano moved to (West) Berlin in 1984 and began her studies in visual communication at the Berlin University of the Arts in 1985. In 1989 she graduated as a master student (Meistersch√ºler-Degree) in experimental film design under Wolfgang Ramsbott. In 1990 she held a scholarship at the Institute for New Media (INM) in Frankfurt am Main, headed by Peter Weibel. It was during that time that she met her future husband, Nicolas Reichelt.vgl. http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/werke/esposizione-impraticabile/ und http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/werke/TouchMe After a lectureship at the Offenbach University of Art and Design (HfG) she was appointed to teach at the Academy of Visual Arts Leipzig in 1995 where she has since held a professorship in computer graphics, and has taught the class for intermedia since 1998. In 2003‚Äì2004 she taught at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano for one academic year. Since 2000 she has curated numerous exhibitions at the national and international level as part of her university duties, addressing political and social issues and incorporating both process-orientated and media-reflective methods.  Artistry  In the 1980s Alba D'Urbano's artistic interest focused on the drastic changes in the perception of reality brought about by the increasingly influential glut of virtual images, which are generated by the mass media and susceptible to manipulation. At the core of her artistic exploration was the relationship between the written word and the new media. Berlin's urban space with its partly truncated communication paths and its insular status provided the setting for her first video works from the series Nur die Augen k√∂nnen (filmed at Checkpoint Charlie, 1985) and Kreis, der (filmed on Ernst-Reuter-Platz, 1987). For the video installations for the series Berlin Kulturstadt Europas she focused on local communication media; in the series of paintings entitled Prometheus she addressed the impoverished human communications and the loss of writing. In the 1990s Alba D'Urbano turned to \\"interactive video and computer installations, to which her creative, complex, experimentally enhancing and problem-conscious approach gave significant impetus as a means of artistic impression\\".G√ºnter Mei√üner (ed.): Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, Vol. 31, Saur Verlag, Munich 2002, p. 181 ff. In her projects, some of which featured a multiplicity of media (e.g. L'esposizione impraticabile, 1992, '96; Rosa Binaria, 1993‚Äì96;http://90.146.8.18/de/archives/festival_archive/festival_catalogs/festival_artikel.asp?iProjectID=8819 Hautnahhttp://www.inm.de/people/alba/couture/ and Il sarto immortale, 1995‚Äì98) she raised the viewer's awareness of mass media and their 'problematic nature without polemic and without affecting the aesthetic evocative force of various media' [Fu√ünote 2, K√ºnstlerlexikon]. In a bid to counter an overwhelming array of media images, she began to toy with the viewer's expectations. She substituted images with illegible strings of characters and drew the viewer's attention towards the way in which media images are created and the processes they involve. She gained international renown through her multi-part projects Hautnah and Il Sarto Immortale, in which she digitally processed images of her own body and then had them printed onto fabric and transformed into items of clothing to be showcased by models on catwalks. In the interplay between clothing and nakedness she literally exposed the commercial exploitation of women's bodies in the mass media and the fashion industry. The works she developed jointly with Tina Bara are inspired by feminist standpoints: there, the body is portrayed as a matrix inscribed into which are identities as a cultural and social construct. For the two women artists it is always about the process of allocating normative attitudes and behaviour patterns. In a series of intermedia projects such as Portrait Alba / Tina Ritratto and Bellissima the artists also referenced biographical material. A new added element incorporated by Tina Bara is the subject of the German Democratic Republic's past. The series of portraits entitled Siegerehrungen (2003) for instance features former elite GDR athletes. The project Covergirl: Wespen- Akte (2007-2009) looks at the opposition group Frauen f√ºr den Frieden, of which Tina Bara is also a member.

There are numerous systems on board an aircraft that must be set in the proper configuration to allow it to take off safely. Prior to every flight, the flight officers use checklists to verify that each of the many systems is operating and has been configured correctly. However, due to the inevitability of human error, even the checklist procedure can lead to failures to properly configure the aircraft. Several improper configurations can leave an aircraft completely unable to become airborne‚Äîthese conditions can easily result in fatal hull loss accidents. In order to reduce this, all major nations now mandate something similar to the US requirement that on (nearly) \\"all airplanes with a maximum weight more than 6,000 pounds and all jets [...] a takeoff warning system must be installed\\". This system must meet the following requirements: > (a) The system must provide to the pilots an aural warning that is > automatically activated during the initial portion of the takeoff roll if > the airplane is in a configuration that would not allow a safe takeoff. The > warning must continue until‚Äî :(1) The configuration is changed to allow safe > takeoff, or :(2) Action is taken by the pilot to abandon the takeoff roll. > (b) The means used to activate the system must function properly for all > authorized takeoff power settings and procedures and throughout the ranges > of takeoff weights, altitudes, and temperatures for which certification is > requested.https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/23.703 TOWS is designed to sound a warning for numerous other dangerous errors in the take-off configuration, such as the flaps and slats not being extended when the throttles are opened while the aircraft is on the ground.

In 2012, the ELCF archbishop expressed his wish that the Luther Foundation establish its own church body. The founding of the Ev. Luth. Mission Diocese of Finland in 2013 marked independence from the Mission Province of Sweden, although contacts remained close. The ELCF continued to defrock its pastors now serving in the Mission Diocese: Bishop Risto Soramies was defrocked on 9 October 2013 and Dean Juhana Pohjola on 5 August 2014. On 8 April 2015, the Cathedral Chapter of the ELCF Archdiocese of Turku defrocked five ELCF pastors for breaking their ordination vows by serving in the Mission Diocese that the ELCF viewed a de facto different church body. The Mission Diocese was founded in response to the perceived secularisation and liberalisation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and \\"to spread, maintain and renovate the true faith, to revive and strengthen Christian life and to implement Christian charity and diaconia\\" in Finland.

Born in Massachusetts, Messinger was educated in Vermont and married the daughter of Matthew Lyon. He left with Lyon to Kentucky, but disagreed with his stance on slavery and came to the Indiana Territory in 1802. He served in the Indiana Territorial Legislature and advocated for the creation of the Illinois Territory. When the state of Illinois was created in 1818, he co-authored its constitution and served in its first General Assembly as Speaker of the House. Messinger was also a prominent surveyor, establishing what is now the state line between Illinois and Wisconsin on behalf of the U.S. government. Biography John Messinger was born in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on January 4, 1771. In 1783, his family moved to Vermont. There, Messinger attained an education and showed skill with mathematics. He held a number of jobs in Vermont including carpenter, builder, teacher, mill-wright, and farmer. He married Anne Lyon, a daughter of Col. Matthew Lyon, a member of the United States House of Representatives. At the time, Lyon was being persecuted via the Alien and Sedition Acts so he decided to move, with Messinger, to Kentucky near the mouth of the Cumberland River. Lyon became a prosperous slave trader, but this irked anti-slavery Messinger and his brother-in-law George Cadwell. Cadwell and Messenger moved to the Indiana Territory in 1802, settling near New Design in what is now Monroe County, Illinois. Messinger operated a gristmill on Rockhouse Creek. He moved to Clinton Hill in 1806, where he lived for the rest of his life. Messinger's education was appreciated by his fellow pioneers, particularly for his surveying skills. Aside from the mill, Messinger worked as a teacher, cartographer, carpenter, cabinetmarker, and farmer. He surveyed most of St. Clair and Madison Counties. He was also commissioned to survey the military land between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. With Philip Creamer, Messinger opened a shop manufacturing surveyors' compasses. Messinger served in the Indiana Territorial legislature in 1808 and advocated for the creation of the Illinois Territory. He was named postmaster of Clinton Hill the next year. Messinger was considered a leading citizen of Illinois when the state was organized in 1818. He represented Illinois when the state line with the Territory of Michigan was formed, now the state line with Wisconsin. He was appointed a delegate to the first constitutional convention, making him a co-author of the Constitution of Illinois. He was then elected to the Illinois House of Representatives for the 1st Illinois General Assembly, where he also served as the first Speaker of the House. The two-year term was the last political office he held. He published A Manual or Handbook of Practical Surveying in 1821. Messinger became a mathematics teacher at John Mason Peck's Rock Spring seminary in 1827. He fought in the Black Hawk War. Messinger died on September 16, 1846. He was buried in Messinger Cemetery in Swansea, Illinois.

Son of the painter Benedetto Gennari and Julia Bovi, Ercole was baptized in the collegiate church of San Biagio, in Cento. He originally studied to be a surgeon. However his lifetime association with the painter Guercino, including the marrying his sister Lucia in 1628, and the guidance and influence of his father and his older brother the painter Bartolomeo Gennari (1594-1661), led Ercole to choose the profession of painter. His style puts him in the Bolognese School of painting. He painted Madonna and Child with St. Felix of Cantalice and Trinity with Saints Ursula, Francesco and Antonio, preserved in the Pinacoteca Comunale di Cesena. After the death of Paul Anthony, the brother of Guercino who was the assistant principal and administrator of the painting workshop, Ercole went to live with his wife and sons Benedetto and Cesare, in Bologna, in the house of Guercino, who, without a family of his own, needed someone to maintain the relationships with customers and administer the property, which he bequeathed to the young grandchildren to whom he had also taught him to paint. Ercole Gennari was buried in the family chapel of the Bolognese church of St. Nicholas of Albari.

It focuses on topsoil regeneration, increasing biodiversity, improving the water cycle, enhancing ecosystem services, supporting biosequestration, increasing resilience to climate change, and strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil. Practices include recycling as much farm waste as possible and adding composted material from sources outside the farm. Regenerative agriculture on small farms and gardens is often based on philosophies like permaculture, agroecology, agroforestry, restoration ecology, keyline design, and holistic management. Large farms tend to be less philosophy driven and often use \\"no-till\\" and/or \\"reduced till\\" practices. On a regenerative farm, yield should increase over time. As the topsoil deepens, production may increase and fewer external compost inputs are required. Actual output is dependent on the nutritional value of the composting materials and the structure and content of the soil.

Field Hamois Belgium Luc Viatour In the early 1980s, the Rodale Institute began using the term ‚Äòregenerative agriculture‚Äô. Rodale Publishing formed the Regenerative Agriculture Association, which began publishing regenerative agriculture books in 1987 and 1988. However, the institute stopped using the term in the late 1980s, and it only appeared sporadically (in 2005 and 2008), until they released a white paper in 2014, titled \\"Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change\\". The paper's summary states, ‚Äúwe could sequester more than 100% of current annual CO2 emissions with a switch to common and inexpensive organic management practices, which we term 'regenerative organic agriculture.'‚Äù The paper described agricultural practices, like crop rotation, compost application, and reduced tillage, that are similar to organic agriculture methods. Newly- planted soybean plants are emerging from the residue left behind from a prior wheat harvest. This demonstrates crop rotation and no-till planting. Storm Cunningham documented the beginning of what he called \\"restorative agriculture\\" in his first book, The Restoration Economy. Cunningham defined restorative agriculture as, a technique that rebuilds the quantity and quality of topsoil, while also restoring local biodiversity (especially native pollinators) and watershed function.

Terra Genesis International, High Falls, NY, 2016. * Increase soil fertility. * Work with whole systems (holistically), not isolated parts, to make changes to specific parts. * Improve whole agro-ecosystems (soil, water, and biodiversity). * Connect the farm to its larger agro-ecosystem and region. * Make holistic decisions that express the value of farm contributors. * Each person and farm is significant. * Make sure all stakeholders have equitable and reciprocal relationships. * Payment can be financial, spiritual, social, or environmental capital (\\"multi- capital\\"). Relationships can be \\"non-linear\\" (not reciprocal): if you do not get paid, in the future you can be given other \\"capital\\" by unrelated parties. * Continually grow and evolve individuals, farms, and communities. * Continuously evolve the agro-ecology. * Agriculture influences the world.  Practices  Practices include but are not limited to: * Permaculture design *Aquaculture *Agroecology *Agroforestry *Soil food web * Livestock: well- managed grazing, animal integration and holistically managed grazing * Sheer, total and utter neglect (STUN) breeding *Keyline subsoiling *Conservation farming, no-till farming, minimum tillage, and pasture cropping * Cover crops & multi-species cover crops * Organic annual cropping and crop rotations * Compost, compost tea, animal manures and thermal compost * Natural sequence farming * Grassfed livestock * Polyculture and full-time succession planting of multiple and inter-crop plantings * Borders planted for pollinator habitat and other beneficial insects * Biochar/terra preta * Ecological aquaculture * Perennial crops * Silvopasture * Alternative food networks (AFNs), commonly defined by attributes such as the spatial proximity between farmers and consumers. *Home gardens, to mitigate the adverse effect of global food shocks and food price volatilities. Consequently, there is much attention towards home gardens as a strategy to enhance household food security and nutrition. *Regrowing vegetables, for recycling and sustainable living. year=2020isbn=location=pages=}}  Criticism  Some claims made by proponents of regenerative agriculture have been criticized as exaggerated and unsupported by evidence by some members of the scientific community.Grazed and Confused?, Food Climate Research Network, 2017, p.64 One of the famous proponents of regenerative agriculture, Allan Savory has claimed in his TED talk that holistic grazing could reduce carbon dioxide levels to pre- industrial levels in a span of 40 years. According to Skeptical Science, \\"it is not possible to increase productivity, increase numbers of cattle and store carbon using any grazing strategy, never-mind Holistic Management [...] Long term studies on the effect of grazing on soil carbon storage have been done before, and the results are not promising.[...] Because of the complex nature of carbon storage in soils, increasing global temperature, risk of desertification and methane emissions from livestock, it is unlikely that Holistic Management, or any management technique, can reverse climate changehttps://skepticalscience.com/holistic-management-rebuttal.html.\\" According to a 2016 study published by the University of Uppsala, the actual rate at which improved grazing management could contribute to carbon sequestration is seven times lower than the claims made by Savory.

It was founded by Anthony Holmead in 1794 as a privately owned secular cemetery open to the public. The city of Washington, D.C., constructed the Western Burial Ground on the remainder of the city block in 1798, and the two burial grounds became synonymous. The city took ownership of the private Holmead cemetery in 1820. The unified cemetery went into steep decline around 1850, and it was closed on March 6, 1874. Removal of remains, most of which were reinterred at Graceland Cemetery or Rock Creek Cemetery, continued until 1885. Burying ground history =Founding Holmead's Burying Ground= Holmead's Burying Ground was built on land originally owned by Anthony Holmead, a tobacco farmer who lived in Prince George's County in the Province of Maryland in the early and mid 1700s. In 1718 or 1726, Holmead purchased of land in the northern section of what was known as the \\"Widow's Mite\\" tract in what would later become the District of Columbia. Holmead died intestate in 1750, and his nephew, a 22-year-old from Devon, England, also named Anthony Holmead, inherited the estate and emigrated to America to take ownership of it. Upon his arrival in Maryland, the younger Holmead purchased two additional land patents (Beall's Plains and Lamar's Outlet) along Rock Creek north of Widow's Mite. The younger Holmead wanted to build a burying ground on part of the Widow's Mite tract. It is unclear whether he actually established a family burial plot there by 1791, or merely contemplated one, but the intended location was a space on the southwest corner of what is now 19th and T Streets NW. (The long edge was along 19th Street.) His plans were complicated by the establishment of the District of Columbia. On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who chose a portion of the states of Maryland and Virginia on January 24, 1791. Only a portion of the new \\"District of Columbia\\" was intended to be used as a city. This \\"Federal City\\", or City of Washington, was laid out in the L'Enfant Plan of 1791, and was bounded by Boundary Street (northwest and northeast; now Florida Avenue), 15th Street Northeast, East Capitol Street, the Anacostia River, the Potomac River, and Rock Creek. The federal government purchased title to all land within the Federal City, which included land owned by Holmead. Holmead was entitled to repurchase his land at ¬£12 and 10 pence per acre, and did so. Part of his repurchase involved the rectangle on the northeast corner of what was now called Square 109. Holmead's purchase was delayed for nearly five years. Square 109 lay just inside the city limits, it was unclear just where streets were to be laid out. It took five years for surveying and platting of the city to be completed. Finally, on August 31, 1796, the federal government at last determined the exact locations of 19th and T Streets and the boundaries of Square 109 and permitted Holmead to purchase his plot of land. =Founding the Western Burial Ground= The City of Washington designated the entirety Square 109 as a public burying ground on February 28, 1798, turning the rest of the block into a publicly owned cemetery known as the Western Burial Ground. Unfortunately, the Western Burial Ground was not as ideally sited as Holmead's Burying Ground. The southern end of the cemetery was just a few feet above the water table, which meant that coffins could be buried only down, and erosion often exposed burials in this section. Operation Even though technically within the boundary of the city, for most of its history Holmead's was essentially in a rural area of forest with heavy undergrowth. There were almost no buildings around it, and the cemetery could only be reached by 20th Street‚Äîwhich could be distinguished from the surrounding forest only because the trees along the route had (mostly) been cut down and there was a rutted wagon track to follow. The site was so rural that, for many years, the track followed by the northbound mail stagecoach ran through the center of Square 109. =Early burials= Burials at Holmead's began even before the Holmead purchased his land. The first recorded burial occurred on May 29, 1794, when Robert Smith of Boston was interred in the far northeast corner of the burying ground. Other burials soon followed. There were enough burials at the site (even though it had not officially opened) that the interment of Patrick McGurk in 1802 created a serious controversy. McGurk was the first man ever executed in the District of Columbia (he murdered his wife while drunk). His body was buried at Holmead's, but relatives of those already buried there decided it was an affront to their loved ones. That night, a mob disinterred McGurk's corpse and buried it in a ravine to the east. When McGurk's friends discovered the desecration of his remains, they dug up the body and had it reburied at Holmead the following night. Members of the Hines family (a prominent and wealthy clan living in the District) discovered that McGurk had been buried next to one of their kin, they disinterred the body yet again and buried it in a marsh immediately to the west of Holmead's. This time, the body was not easily discovered, and it lay there undisturbed for almost 80 years. Another early burial was that of the entire Pearce (or Peerce) family. About 1804, as Lafayette Square was about to be developed, the entire Pearce family cemetery was relocated to Holmead's. The Pearces owned a farm on the land north of the White House, and the family's burying ground was located on the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue NW near the southwest corner of the soon-to-be-constructed square. In 1807, the laying out of burial plots at Holmead's Burying Ground was finally completed, and the cemetery opened for business. Lots were put up for sale for $2 each ($ in dollars), with purchases limited to a total of six lots. At that time, the cemetery was not yet enclosed, but Holmead promised to erect a fence within year. =City takeover= On May 15, 1820, the City of Washington took title to Holmead's Burying Ground. The term \\"Western Burial Ground\\" and \\"Holmead's Burying Ground\\" began to be used as a synonym for the entire square about this time. Three commissioners were appointed to oversee the cemetery, and for many years these positions were held by Lewis Johnson, Jacob A. Bender, and Dr. Joseph Burrows. A sexton was also appointed, and given the duty of not only digging graves but keeping records of burials. Accurate records for both Holmead's and Western were kept back to 1812, although they were incomplete prior to that year. For most of the unified cemetery's history, the position of sexton was occupied by just three men: John Douglas, Guy Graham, and W.R. Graham. To ensure that the cemetery remained open to all members of the public, the city enacted a law in 1829 under which the sexton could be fined $10 for refusing to bury someone. The city takeover also required that the entire block be enclosed with a split-rail fence with gates. (This was later replaced by a more solid plank fence.) The cemetery was to be segregated by race, with a fence of thorn bushes separating the African American section from the rest of the burial ground. (Racial segregation of burials continued until the cemetery closed.) The price of burial plots was raised to $3 for choice sites and $2.50 for less select sites. Proceeds from lot sales were to pay for the retention of records, the construction of a sexton's house, and for maintenance of the grounds. =Deterioration= Much of the land around Holmead's Burying Ground was sold for development by the early 1850s, and houses and other buildings began to be constructed on nearby city blocks. To accommodate the new development, the city graded and gravelled 20th Street in 1856, making it far easier to access Holmead's. The cemetery began to near capacity in the late 1850s. But burials were also slowing dramatically. The rapidly growing city needed more cemeteries, and as these were built they provided competition for Holmead's. New cemeteries included the Presbyterian Burying Ground in 1802 (which drew wealthy and middle class whites from the Georgetown neighborhood), the massive Congressional Cemetery in 1807, the Roman Catholic Holy Rood Cemetery in 1832, the landscaped and luxuriously designed Oak Hill Cemetery in 1848 (also in Georgetown), the large and landscaped Glenwood Cemetery in 1854, the massive Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery in 1858 (which largely replaced Holy Rood), and Prospect Hill Cemetery in 1858. There was even competition for African American burials, as new blacks-only cemeteries such as Mount Zion Cemetery (1808), the Harmoneon (1829), the Female Union Band Cemetery (1842), and Columbian Harmony Cemetery (which replaced the Harmoneon in 1859) were constructed. Fewer and fewer whites people were interred at Holmead's, and most of the burials which occurred came from the city's African American population. The lack of activity at Holmead's attracted vandals, who knocked over monuments and desecrated graves there. The situation became so serious that the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department began patrolling the grounds. The deterioration at Holmead's Burying Ground was accelerated as the cemetery was filled beyond its capacity in the 1860s and 1870s. Burial plots often contained three or four bodies, one on top of the other, with the uppermost coffin just a foot or two below the surface. Space was at such a premium that plots were sold immediately adjacent to the walkways, creating crowded conditions. Changes to Boundary Street worsened the cemetery's appearance. The street was graded in late 1869 and early 1870, which dropped the street some below the surface of the cemetery. But no retaining walls were constructed, leaving the earthen banks prone to erosion. Coffins next to Boundary Street sometimes became exposed, and some even fell into the street. Closure =1871 attempted closure= In August 1871, the D.C. Board of Public Health declared Holmead's Burying Ground a public nuisance. The cemetery was in significant disrepair, and it was overgrown with shrubs, vines, and weeds. Noxious odors and fluids emanated from recent graves, which were too near the surface. Extensive development, primarily housing, had occurred in the area, exposing the public to these problems. The goal of the designation of Holmead's as a public nuisance was to permit the mass disinterment of bodies and the reclamation of Square 109 for development purposes (such as housing). However, no funds for such disinterment were available, and the Board of Public Health said it lacked the authority to order disinterments. The city also barred new interments at Holmead's Burying Ground some time before December 1873, but the order was not enforced.; By this time, the cemetery contained more than 9,000 official burials, with unofficial burials bring the total to more than 10,000. All burials were supposed to be registered with the city. But many people could not pay for the burial of a loved one, and it was not uncommon for poorer people to bury their deceased surreptitiously at night or to bribe a sexton to permit an unofficial burial. Unofficial and illegal burials continued despite the city's interment bans. Simply abandoning the cemetery in situ was not an option. Public pressure was mounting to have the cemetery moved, and Square 109 turned into a more useful site. Subsequently, the Board of Public Health recommended that the site be cleared of bodies and turned into a public park. Now largely abandoned, Holmead's Burying Ground became a prime target of \\"resurrectionists\\", or body snatchers. Resurrectionists often haunted cemeteries to identify lonely people whose bodies had been newly interred. They then dug up the corpse and sold it to anatomists, medical schools, and other institutions of higher learning. George Christian, a clerk in the office of the Surgeon General of the United States, opened a resurrectionist business about 1870, and stole not only bodies but funerary materials (clothing, coffins, shrouds, and urns) as well. One of his assistants, Maude Brown, would attend the funeral of a newly deceased person who appeared to lack friends or family. She marked the grave, and later that night Christian and his male friends \\"resurrected\\" the body. Christian dressed so well in the fine clothing he stole from corpses that he avoided detection for years. On December 12, 1873, Christian and his companions were arrested for public intoxication, suspicious behavior, and drunk and disorderly conduct on a sidewalk near Holmead's Burying Ground. In a large sack carried by the men, the police discovered the body of Thomas Fletcher‚Äîwhom the gang had just liberated from Holmead's. Christian was convicted of body snatching, and sentenced to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.; =1874 closure and the beginning of disinterments= The resurrectionist activity spurred the city to act. It ordered all burials at the cemetery to cease on March 6, 1874, and it began strictly enforcing its order. The closure of the cemetery led many families to begin to disinter their loved ones in anticipation of the burying ground's closure. Among these were Peggy O'Neale Eaton, former owner of one of the most popular hotels in the city, the Franklin House. Eaton's parents, William and Rhoda O'Neale, and two of her brothers were buried at Holmead's. Once a wealthy socialite married to Senator John Henry Eaton, her reputation was destroyed during the Petticoat affair of 1830-1831 that rocked President Andrew Jackson's Cabinet. Eaton's third husband, Antonio Gabriele Buchignani, then ran off to Europe with Eaton's money. With her family's graves at risk, Eaton had to beg wealthy D.C. philanthropist William Wilson Corcoran for the funds to move her relatives to Oak Hill Cemetery. The money was granted, and the O'Neales were moved. As pressure to close Holmead's Burying Ground and move the bodies elsewhere mounted, questions about the legality of the move began to be raised. Chief among the concerns was the common assumption that the Holmead family had turned over its portion of Square 109 to the city for use exclusively as a burial ground. If this land was no longer used for that purpose, it was believed, the property would revert to Holmead's heirs. A legal investigation into the transfer of title began in January 1874 to resolve the question. In 1878, the D.C. city commissioners voted to provide $2,000 for the disinterment of bodies at Holmead's. There is a question as to whether the city had the legal authority to disinter remains at this time. John Claggett Proctor, writing in The Evening Star in November 1884, said the city lacked this legal authority \\"until recently\\", which indicates that controversy over the city's disinterment plan existed. By this time, the investigation into the cemetery's legal title had revealed an astonishing fact: The city had no right to occupy most of Square 109. In 1798, land in the District of Columbia which had not yet been sold to private owners still belonged to the federal government. While Anthony Holmead had paid for and owned the lot in the northeast corner, the federal government had not transferred title to the rest of square to the District of Columbia. Thus, when the District of Columbia ordered the rest of Square 109 turned into a city-owned cemetery in 1798, it did not have title to this land and thus lacked the legal right to make such an order. Since the city did not own this land, the sale of burial plots on the non-Holmead portion were invalid. This quashed any attempt by lotholders to stop the removals. Somewhat anticlimactically, the title investigation also revealed that the Holmead plot would not revert to the heirs if it was abandoned as a burying ground. Congressional action was needed to remedy the situation. On March 3, 1879, Congress enacted legislation (20 Stat. 353) that transferred title of Square 109 to the District of Columbia. The law also granted the city permission to begin disinterments, and contained a provision to reimburse lotholders for reinterment costs. By October 1879, more than 700 private disinterments had occurred, although a great many more reburials had yet to occur. =Second round of disinterments= On June 4, 1880, Congress appropriated $2,000 to allow the District of Columbia to assist families in removing the bodies of loved ones from Holmead's Burying Ground. The city commissioners said in July that they would approve disinterments without question in order to speed the process. They began advertising the city's assistance in removing bodies on July 8, and announced a deadline for removals of December 10, 1880. The federal funds ran out in 1881, so another $3,000 was appropriated to continue the removals. The city awarded a contract to a local firm about January 1882 to begin mass disinterment of the remaining burials. Work began at the southern end of the cemetery. Workers dug to a depth of six feet, lifting out coffins where they could be found and sifting the earth for any other remains. As they worked their way north, most of the remains they discovered were the caskets of children, whose bodies and soft bones had long decomposed. Cemetery records were reviewed to determine if the body was Caucasian or African American. White remains were sent to a mass grave at Rock Creek Cemetery, and black remains were transferred to a mass grave at Graceland Cemetery. As many as 1,000 remains had been disinterred. But the 1881 appropriation also ran out, leaving an estimated 2,000 corpses behind. The process of removing such large numbers of remains was not well managed. Many coffins were left exposed, and a large number of empty graves were not filled in. A public scandal erupted in April when local children were seen playing with leg and arm bones, and placing skulls on poles. =Final removals and sale= As the city cleared Holmead's Burying Ground and readied it for sale, city attorneys discovered that the 1879 law gave the city title to the land‚Äîbut did not give it any right to sell or convey the land. The city desperately wanted to sell it: There was strong private interest in the land, and the city said that if it received the right to sell the property it would place the square on the market as fast as it could. Congressional action was once again needed to rectify the problem. On June 24, 1884, the House of Representatives took up the conference report for the District of Columbia appropriations bill for fiscal 1885 (July 1, 1884 to June 30, 1885). During floor debate, the conference report was amended to give the city the authority to sell Holmead's Burying Ground so long as the proceeds were used to fund the D.C. public schools. The Senate agreed to the House's amended conference report (23 Stat. 130) on July 5, 1884. Although removals were still occurring at Holmead's, work halted at the start of October 1884 as warm weather made the stench from decomposing bodies too noisome for work to continue. The work crew of 70 men resumed disinterments on October 28, and by late November a total of 3,000 bodies had been removed from Holmead's. Workers anticipated that the cemetery would be empty by mid to late December. The cost of this last phase of the removal was estimated at $4,000. (The city intended to finance this cost from the land sale.) On December 16, funeral home director A.H. Gawler exhumed the body of Lewis Powell from Holmead's Burying Ground. Powell, one of the four conspirators hanged for playing a role in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in July 1865, had been buried there in an unmarked grave (the site known only to Gawler and a few U.S. Army personnel). The Evening Star newspaper reported in January 1885 that, during this final phase of disinterment, a total of 1,246 bodies had been moved to a mass grave at Graceland Cemetery, 1,665 bodies had been moved to a mass grave at Rock Creek Cemetery, and 958 bodies had been moved by family members. On December 22, 1884, the city sold the entirety of Square 109 () to John Roll McLean, publisher of The Washington Post, for $52,000. In doing so, the city confirmed that it had removed all bodies from the site. The remaining $48,000 went to the construction and maintenance of city public schools. McLean built Holmead Park on a portion of the former Holmead's Burying Ground. In 1905, he erected the Cordova Apartments (now the President Madison Apartments) on the northwest corner of the square. About the cemetery Holmead's Burying Ground was a typical urban cemetery. The pathways through the cemetery were straight, and most graves were marked with upright sandstone slabs. Some family plots were marked by large, above-ground monuments and ringed with iron fences. Burial plots were small, and graves were closely packed. Landscaping was minimal, and consisted of short cedar trees. For most of its history, a solid wooden wall enclosed the cemetery on all sides. The northeast quarter of the site (which included the original Holmead's burial plot) was reserved for Caucasians. The cemetery was racially segregated, and the southwest quarter of the square (which was somewhat separate from the rest of the site by a ravine) served as the burial ground for African Americans. The southeast section was generally reserved for military personnel. Most of the burials here were soldiers who fought in the War of 1812, and nearly all of them came from Camp Hill (a United States Army encampment located where the United States Naval Observatory now exists). At one point before 1879, a portion of the military section was illegally sold to a local African American association which had formed to create a cemetery for colored people. The sale was discovered and situation rectified. Until the end of the 1850s, Holmead's Burying Ground was one of the two most prominent cemeteries in the District of Columbia, and until Glenwood Cemetery and Oak Hill Cemetery opened, Holmead's Burying Ground was thronged with visitors each Sunday. Notable interments Holmead's Burying Ground was one of the most prominent cemeteries in Washington, D.C., from its inception until about 1850. Many locally famous people and locally prominent families were buried there. Among some of the notable burials were: *Lorenzo Dow (1777-1834), itinerant preacher in the Second Great Awakening (later removed to Oak Hill Cemetery) *James Hoban (c.?1758-1831), architect and designer of the White House (later removed to Mount Olivet Cemetery) *James McGurk aka James McGirk (?-1802), first man to be executed in the District of Columbia (removed to a nearby marsh after two days) *Josiah Meigs (1757-1822), president of the University of Georgia and Commissioner of the General Land Office (removed in 1878 to Arlington National Cemetery) *William and Rhoda ( Howell) O'Neale, the owners of Franklin House, a popular Washington, D.C., hotel, and parents of socialite Peggy Eaton; the family burial plot also included two of their adult male children (removed between 1874 and 1879 to Oak Hill Cemetery) *Lewis Powell (1844-1865), co-conspirator in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln (removed in 1884, but the site of reinterment is not known) *William Winston Seaton (1785-1866), journalist and newspaper editor (removed at an unknown date to Congressional Cemetery) *Andrew Way, noted printer of Congressional documents (before the establishment of the United States Government Printing Office) in the District of Columbia See also *Anthony Holmead Archeological Site References ;Notes ;Citations Bibliography       Category:Former cemeteries in Washington, D.C.

He was killed in action while leading a Chechen volunteer unit on the Ukrainian side during the War in Donbass in 2015. Biography Munayev was a police officer in the city of Grozny before the outbreak of hostilities with Russia. At the beginning of the Second Chechen War in 1999, the Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, appointed him as a military commandant of Grozny. During the Battle of Grozny (1999‚Äì2000), Munayev organized ambushes, car bombs and mine explosions against the Russian forces. In October 2000, the Russian authorities erroneously reported that he had been killed when a group of rebels tried to blow up a military truck. After the Chechen forces withdrew from the capital to the mountains, Munayev was made a brigadier general and commander of the Southwestern front early in 2001. Having sustained a serious injury during fighting, he was forced to leave Chechnya in 2004 or 2005. He was granted political asylum in Denmark, where he became the organizer of the public political movement \\"Free Caucasus\\", which was founded in 2009. In July 2014, during the War in Donbass, the organization announced the formation of an \\"international peacekeeping battalion\\" of volunteers to support Ukraine in fighting against the pro-Russian insurgency. The battalion was named the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion after the first President of Chechnya, Dzhokhar Dudayev, and Munayev was appointed as its commander. During the armed conflict the Dudayev battalion operated between Donetsk and Luhansk with approximately 500 volunteers. The battalion was not subject to any political leader in Kyiv, or subordinate to any political structure there. Munayev was killed in the Battle of Debaltseve on 1 February 2015. He was hit by shrapnel from a tank shell in the village of Chernukhino, also known as Chornukhyne, near Debaltseve. He had a large gaping wound and died instantly. He was 49 years old. He was buried in the Ukrainian city Dnipro in the Muslim section of the Krasnopil cemetery near the Dnieper. A memorial sign in honor of Isa Munayev was unveiled in Dnipro, Radio Free Europe (7 August 2018) After his death, British-educated Chechen national Adam Osmayev was chosen as the new leader of the Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion, which had the aim to defend Debaltseve. Shortly afterward, Debaltseve was taken by separatist forces and a ceasefire came into effect. It is unclear if the battalion is still active in the conflict.  Legacy  Memorial complex dedicated to Munaev in the museum \\"Civil feat of Dnipropetrovsk region in the events of the anti-terrorist operation\\" (Dnipro) In the National Museum of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the Central House of Officers a memorial stand dedicated the Hero of the War in Donbass and the commander of the \\"Dudayev Battalion\\" Isa Munayev, was opened.

Set on 44 acres, the Scottish Baronial castle is now a luxury hotel.  History  In the early 14th century, King Robert III granted Alexander Strachan a tract of land in Forfar which went on to become the Kinettles baronial estate. A dated stone situated opposite the castle's dovecot suggests that a modest two-story house occupied the site from 1678. In the 16th century ownership of the land was passed to the Lindsays who held it for 200 years before it was passed on to Sir Thomas Moodie, the then Provost of Dundee. A survey carried out in 1791 by the Reverend David Ferney also refers to the \\"manor house\\" at Kinnettles, making mention of the fact that it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the area.Statistical Accounts for the Parish of Kinnettles in Angus (or Forfarshire), Scotland Years 1791-99 The property again traded hands in the 17th century, when it was bought by the Bower family. In 1802 the Kinnettles estate was sold to John Aberdein Harvey who built a second manor house surrounded by fine parkland. In 1864 James Paterson bought the property and began work on the structure known today as Kinnettles Castle. The existing manor houses were both demolished to make room for a new castle built in the Scottish Baronial style, more as a statement of wealth than as a genuine defence. It is reported that the central tower of Kinnettles Castle was modelled on the much older Ackergill Tower located near Wick in Caithness. Further changes were made in 1914 when the mansion house and neighbouring farms were bought by Sir James Duncan, who is said to have made ‚Äòcostly improvements‚Äô before his brief period of ownership ended with his death some 12 years later. His trustees then sold the property in 1926 to Sir Harry Hope; the castle was occupied by the Hope family until 1960, when it was sold to the Walker-Munro family. From the more recent ownerships the mansion house and western half of the landscape have become separated from the walled garden and eastern half of the landscape, after further refurbishment from the penultimate owners it was then leased out for a staff training facility. The only surviving building from the original Kinnettles estate is a farmhouse that was converted into the gardener's house during Paterson's extensive remodeling works.  Refurbishment  Kinnettles Castle, formerly Kinnettles House is owned by Clarenco LLP and operated under the AmaZing Venues brand name. The house was purchased in March 2011, the previous owners (who owned the Castle for 3 years) oversaw an extensive refurbishment, transforming the building from a training centre into a boutique hotel.A castle fit for a king - DRAM magazine Since work was completed, the main body of the castle has been converted into a nine bedroom hotel. The old Gate Lodge at the entrance to the property has also been converted into a two bedroom standalone holiday cottage.

Life Born at Sheffield on 16 February 1847, he was only son of Thomas Andrews, proprietor of the Wortley Iron Works, near the town, and his wife Mary Bolsover. He was educated at Broombank school, Sheffield, and then as a student of chemistry under Dr. James Allan of Sheffield. Andrews early undertook original scientific research, with the practical advice and guidance of his father, who died in 1871. He then became head at Wortley. In 1888 Andrews was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Chemical Society, and member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and Society of Engineers. He acted as consultant to the Admiralty and the Board of Trade on metallurgical questions. At Cambridge University he delivered lectures to engineering students; and at Sheffield was an advocate of technical education directed to industrial ends, assisted in founding and developing Sheffield University. Andrews died at his home, \\"Ravencrag\\", near Sheffield, on 19 June 1907. Works After investigation on a large scale Andrews determined the resistance of metals to sudden concussion at temperatures down to 0¬∞ Fahrenheit; and was one of the first to study metals by the aid of the microscope, following up the inquiries of Henry Clifton Sorby. In technical periodicals he published around 40 papers: the Society of Engineers awarded him two premiums for papers in their Transactions, \\"On the Strength of Wrought-iron Railway Axles\\" (1879), and \\"On the Effect of Strain on Railway Axles\\" (1895). In 1902 he received the Society's gold medal for the memoir \\"Effect of Segregation on the Strength of Steel Rails\\". In 1884 the Institution of Civil Engineers awarded him a Telford medal. A major paper on \\"Wear of Steel Rails on Bridges\\" was published in the Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute (1895). Andrews by microscopic examination of metallic materials looked to determine the cause of naval accidents, and he contributed on the subject to Engineering (1904). In a paper on the microscopic effects of stress on platinum (Roy. Soc. Proc. 1902) he broke new ground. He was author of Thoughts on Faith and Scepticism.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Family Andrews married in 1870 Mary Hannah, daughter of Charles Stanley of Rotherham, and had issue three sons (two died in childhood) and one daughter.

The 'isolation' (German: Dominanz) of the right two peaks is not labeled, but is represented by the dashed line. \\"sattel zwischen\\" means saddle between so the labeling is saying the saddle between A and C is the same saddle as between A and B Route along a saddle The saddle between two hills (or mountains) is the region surrounding the highest point of the lowest point on the line tracing the drainage divide (the col) connecting the peaks. When, and if, the saddle is navigable, even if only on foot, the saddle of a (optimal) pass between the two massifs, is the area generally found around the lowest route on which one could pass between the two summits, which includes that point which is a mathematically when graphed a relative high along one axis, and a relative low in the perpendicular axis, simultaneously; that point being by definition the col of the saddle. Topography A saddle is the lowest area between two highlands (prominences or peaks) but has two wings which span the divide (the line between the two prominences) by crossing the divide at an angle, so is concurrently the local highpoint of the land surface which falls off in the down direction. That is, the drainage divide is a ridge along the high point of the saddle, as well as between the two peaks so defines the major reference axis. A saddle can vary from a sharp narrow gap to a broad comfortable sway-backed shallow valley so long as it is both the high point in the sloping faces descending to lower elevations and the low area between the two (or three or four.) flanking summits. Concurrently, along a different axis, it is the low point between two peaks, so is the likely 'optimal' high point in a pass if the saddle is traversed by a track, road or railway.

The points -A-, -B-, -C-, -D- and, -E- all represent saddles ‚Äî relative minimums oriented to two or more nearby peaks, but a local maxima relative to lower land. =Saddles and cols= The relationship between saddles and cols is not universally agreed. A col is sometimes defined as the lowest point on a saddle co-linear with the drainage divide that connects the peaks. Whittow describes a saddle as \\"low point or col on a ridge between two summits\\",Whittow, John (1984). Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 464. . whilst the Oxford Dictionary of English implies that a col is the lowest point on the saddle.Soanes, Catherine and Stevenson, Angus (ed.) (2005). Oxford Dictionary of English, 2nd Ed., revised, Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, p. . Monkhouse describes a saddle as a \\"broad, flat col in a ridge between two mountain summits.\\"Monkhouse, FJ (1965). A Dictionary of Geography, 2nd edn. The term col tends to be associated more with mountain, rather than hill, ranges.Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, Allied. The height of a summit above its highest saddle (called the key saddle) is effectively a measure of a hill's prominence, an important measure of the independence of its summit. Saddles lie on the line of the watershed between two hills. Structural geology In structural geology, a saddle is a depression located along the axial trend of an anticline. Mathematical saddles A 'saddle point' in mathematics derives its name from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a surface that curves up in one direction, and curves down in a different direction, resembling a riding saddle or a mountain pass between two peaks forming a landform saddle.

DBSy was developed in the late 1990s by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). It is a model- based approach to information assurance that describes the requirements for security in an organisation, taking account of the business that needs to be supported. The model is based around the concept of a security domain, which represents a logical place where people work with information using a computer system, and which has connections with other security domains where this is necessary to support business activity. Hence the focus is on the information that needs protection, the people that work with it and the people they exchange information with. The model can also describe the physical environments where people work and the system boundaries where major system security measures are placed. A systematic method is then applied to the model to identify and describe the risks to which valuable information assets are exposed and specify security measures that are effective in managing the risks. History DBSy has its origins in the late 1990s, having been developed by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) for the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Initially called the Domain Based Approach, it was developed alongside Purple Penelope to support the MOD's increasing need for interconnections between systems operating at different security levels ,B. Pomeroy and S. Wiseman, \\"Private desktops and shared store,\\" Proc. of 14th Computer Security Applications Conference, pp. 190‚Äì200, Phoenix, AZ, December 1998 .Macdonald R, \\"Purple Penelope and UK MOD's Emerging Strategy for Information Security\\", September 1997 http://www.opengroup.org/security/meetings/sep97/Group.pdf Accessed 27 May 2014 It was recognised that the risks associated with such connections were directly related to the nature of the information exchange that was needed and that an effective model for understanding and managing the risks would need to take account of the business needs for information sharing. It was also recognised that the controlled release of information from a system handling secret information (sometimes referred to at the time as 'down grading' or 'sanitisation') was not adequately described by any of the existing models of Information security (notably Bell-LaPadula, Biba and the associated information flow models). Information flow models were found to be unhelpful in understanding the risks when information has to be shared with people and systems that are not entirely trusted. An effective model for understanding and managing the risks would need to take account of the business needs for exchanging information both within and outside an organisation .Chiew Pheng Goh, \\"A Security Model for a Defence-Related Organization\\" University of Wales, Aberystwyth 30 November 2003 http://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/MSc_dissertations/2003/Goh_Chiew_Pheng.pdf Accessed 26 August 2014 The modelling technique was applied to some major projects for the MOD and as a result of this experience the graphical modelling techniques were revised and a rigorous risk assessment method, based on the concepts of compromise paths was developed.

The DBSy model The DBSy approach uses simple models to represent the requirements for security in an organisation using two different but related viewpoints: the Infosec Business Model represents the security aspects of the business, while the Infosec Infrastructure Model represents the logical provision of strong boundaries that enforce separation. When combined, they make up an Infosec Architecture Model .Ashenden D, Warrener K, \\"Understanding Risk Dependencies in Information Systems\\", Proceedings of the 4th Australian Information Warfare and IT Security Conference, Adelaide, Nov 2003. This model forms the basis for conducting a systematic and rigorous risk assessment. The Infosec business model defines security domains and the connections between them. The model specifies the limits of what information can be processed and exchanged between security domains and so forms the set of security requirements for the business. In particular, connections that are not explicitly modelled are not permitted and are required not to occur. A security domain is characterised by a set of information assets, which may be valuable to the organisation, as well as the people that work with the information and the applications and services that act on their behalf. Connections between domains are characterised by the nature of the interaction that is required (such as interpersonal messages, or shared access to a database) and the sensitivity and integrity requirements of the information exchange. The model can also represent the kinds of physical environment from which a domain can be accessed. The Infosec infrastructure model defines islands of computing infrastructure that are required to be logically separate, so that information cannot be exchanged between them except at identifiable and manageable points of connection, referred to as causeways. An island is characterised by the strength of separation between it and any other islands and by the people who manage its computing infrastructure. An Infosec architecture model combines the business and infrastructure views, by showing which security domains are supported by which islands of infrastructure. Where there are connections between security domains that are hosted on different islands, the connections must be supported by an appropriate causeway. Risk assessment method The DBSy method uses a rational risk framework for describing the risks to which some information assets are exposed. Similar kinds of assets are grouped together as a focus of interest, and the risk assessment process is applied to each focus of interest in turn. The key factors determining the risk to a particular focus of interest are: * business Impact of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the focus of interest; * sets of people who might wish to inflict damage (threat sources) and their motivation for doing so; * groups of people with different opportunities to inflict damage (threat actors) and their capability to do so, who may also be threat sources or could be influenced by others; * the means by which each threat actor might cause damage (causes of compromise); * the defences in place (or planned) to protect the focus of interest. This risk framework is applied in a systematic fashion to an organisation-specific Infosec architecture model, representing the security-relevant features of an organisation's business and IT systems. Through this process a set of Compromise Paths can be systematically described and the relative effectiveness of different countermeasures can be assessed .Hughes K, Wiseman S, \\"Analysis of Information Security Risks: Policy for Protection through to Implementation\\", Proceedings of the 4th European Conference on Information Warfare and Security, Academic Conferences Ltd. , July 2005. Comparison with other IA risk methods DBSy differs from other IT risk management methods in that its primary focus is on people, the business drivers of an organisation and the way the business works, rather than on technical security measures. The analyst is required to systematically define the groups of people that pose a threat and the ways they might cause harm, providing a rigorous, business-oriented framework for the concepts of threat and vulnerability. The aim is to understand and analyse information security risks faced by an organisation, especially where the risks appear to conflict with needs for business efficiency across the organisation or in dealings with customers and business partners.

However, as the colony quickly expanded and settlements spread throughout the Eastern part of what is now Maryland, the town remained the capitol and representatives would travel from all over the colony to participate in the Maryland General Assembly, the colony's first legislative body. The Colony was founded under a mandate by the colonial proprietor, Cecil Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore of England, that the new settlers engage in religious tolerance of each other.Dr. Lois Green Carr, \\"Margaret Brent (ca. 1601-1671)\\", MSA SC 3520-2177, Archives of Maryland (Biographical Series), http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/002100/002177/html/bio.html The first settlers were both Protestant and Catholic during a time of persecution of Catholics.

This was an unheard of request for a Woman of that era and made Brent very possibly the first woman in America to demand the right to vote. However the Maryland colonial Assembly denied her request. In the male- dominated frontier environment of the colonies, far away from the courts of England, Brent was also forced to defend her legal right to manage her own estate before the Maryland Assembly. She won, making her the first woman in English North America to stand for herself in a court of law and before an assembly. She also would eventually demand the right to vote. Brent also served as an attorney before the colonial court, mostly representing women of the colony. She is considered to have been very legally astute. Surviving records indicate that she pleaded at least 134 cases. Although she did not explicitly campaign for women's rights in general, she is credited for having done so implicitly.

By the late 1600s there had been about 1,000 slaves in all the different settlements of the Maryland colony combined, but during the first 75 years of the 1700s, the number of enslaved people increased to nearly 100,000, and kept growing. Over time, the farms in St. Mary's City were consolidated into a large antebellum slave plantation which lasted for more than 150 years until the Civil War.\\"All of Us Would Walk Together: From City to Plantation\\", Historic St. Mary's City https://hsmcdigshistory.org/walktogether/index.php/project/labor-in-marylan/ The plantation changed hands a few times, but continued to grow until it reached over 1,715 acres in size. Enslaved African American's became the largest population in St. Mary's City. Records show that slaves on the plantation were bought and sold which would certainly have broken up families. Ruins and archeological research in the area has shown that slaves lived in poorly insulated huts, enduring the extremes of Maryland weather with little comfort or protection.

A pattern was established of rural poverty in the county among the non-landed free population. Maryland penal codes (anti-Catholic laws) From 1700 until the 1820s, numerous laws were put in place to \\"penalize\\" Catholics for practicing their faith, hence they were called the \\"penal codes\\". Catholics were denied the right to vote in Maryland through most of the 1700s.Robert J. Brugger, \\"Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634-1980\\", Johns Hopkins University Press (August 28, 1996) \\"The Enduring Vision: A History of the American People, Volume I: To 1877\\", By Paul Boyer, Clifford Clark, Karen Halttunen, Sandra Hawley, Joseph Kett, \\"Chapter: 4 The Bonds of Empire: 1660-1740\\" page 70, Cengage Learning, publisher, Jan 1, 2012, When anyone in Maryland was sworn into a position of public trust, they were also required to renounce the Catholic church while being sworn in. This was in order to prevent any Catholic person from secretly gaining a position of power. There were also periods where laws denied Catholics the right to purchase or inherit land in Maryland. Catholics were also not allowed to start their own schools. Wealthy Catholics would secretly send their children abroad to get religious education, but to discourage this, Maryland laws were passed fining parents who did this.Francis Graham Lee, \\"All Imaginable Liberty: The Religious Liberty Clauses of the First Amendment\\", page 359, University Press of America (June 6, 1995) In order to discourage further importation of Irish indentured servants, who were largely Catholic, a prohibitive tax was imposed to try to prevent bringing any more of them to Maryland. Many Catholics hid their faith and worshiped in secret. Others converted to Protestantism or left the state. Even after legal restrictions eased in the 1820s, hostility towards Catholics and religious tensions continued in Maryland until the first half of the 20th Century.Robert J.

Students came to the school from all over the state of Maryland. Religious tensions continued to haunt St. Mary's County and Maryland as a whole in the 1800s, and in response to Kennedy's call for a monument, three prominent St. Mary's County residents called for the establishment of a new school in St. Mary's City which would instead be a \\"Living monument to religious freedom\\". They quickly won Kennedy's support and together they lobbied the Maryland State legislature. The legislature voted to create, fund and designate a nondenominational\\"Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland\\", Page 68, Julia King, University of Tennessee Press; July 30, 2012, , school in St. Mary's City as a \\"Living monument to religious freedom\\". This was a milestone at the time, because only some ten years earlier had the last of Maryland's notorious anti-Catholic \\"penal codes\\" been revoked. Thus the nondenominational \\"St. Mary's seminary\\" was born, named after the original colonial settlement, now only ruins in the same place where the school was founded. That school would eventually become St. Mary's College of Maryland.J. Frederick Fausz, \\"Monument School of the People: A sesquicentennial history of St. Mary's College of Maryland\\", 1840-1990\\", Page 30, SMCM, , The school began as boarding school that included the elementary grades as well as grades 9 through 12. Occasionally boys from the neighboring areas were allowed to take classes as well. A few years later the word \\"Female\\" was added to the school's name.

Wilkinson, Julia A. King, \\"St. Mary's, A When-Did? Timeline\\", page 16, From the founding of the school until 1933, students traveled to the school each year by steamboat, coming down the Chesapeake Bay from Annapolis and Baltimore. This usually meant an overnight trip. The roads of St. Mary's County were largely unpaved and notoriously treacherous until the 1930s, and so water transportation was the best way to access the county. The school also received its mail and supplies by boat. Steamboats would pull up to the school dock, just below the old Statehouse grounds, as often as twice a week. For a fee they would also carry students and faculty on outings over to Piney Point, or to Virginia. By the 1930s, the steamboat service to the school was more of a tradition than a necessity, and it was losing clientele Bay-wide due to the increased usage of automobiles. The main roads leading to the college were also by then paved. So when a storm destroyed the school dock in 1934, the school let go of the steamboat service and transportation to the college was thereafter only by automobile.

She was Principal of St. Mary's Female Seminary and later its first College President, after its expansion. Women gaining right to vote results in call to convert seminary to a junior college Mary Adele France, the principal of St. Mary's Female Seminary at the time, felt inspired by the fact that women had just recently gained the right to vote in America. This led her to believe that women deserved more access to a college education as well. She petitioned the Maryland State Legislature to convert the school to a two-year junior college. This was necessary, France wrote, in order to ready young women for \\"an economic place in the world\\". France then embarked on a determined and ultimately successful lobbying campaign in Annapolis. In 1926, by order of the Maryland Legislature, St. Marys College was expanded to a two- year Female Junior College, combined with the last two years of high school (four years total). At that time, the college dropped the 9th and 10th grades, but combined grades 11 and 12 with the first two years of college, making it a four-year institution, although only a \\"Junior College\\" at the upper two levels.\\"St. Marys: A When-Did Timeline\\", page 12, By Janet Butler Haugaard, Executive Editor and Writer, St. Mary's College of Maryland with Susan G.

Goodpaster was also a decorated veteran of World War II, where he commanded the 48th Engineer Combat Battalion in North Africa and Italy until he was severely wounded. For his service he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, and two Purple Hearts. He continued in the Army as a desk officer and eventually rose to the highest levels of the United States Military Command. In retirement he also became a vocal advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons and the establishment of a permanently nuclear-free world. A building on the campus of St. Mary's College of Maryland, Goodpaster Hall, is named after him. J. Frank Raley, a St. Mary's County politician and advocate for education,\\"J. Frank Raley, Jr.: On Higher Education\\", The Slackwater Center, St. Mary's College of Maryland, http://www.smcm.edu/slackwater/onlineexhibits/JFrankRaley/Index.html had a dream of eliminating the then-deeply entrenched rural poverty in St. Mary's County by greatly enhancing education in the region. He led a campaign to significantly expand all levels of education, by securing numerous capitol programs from the Maryland state Legislature.\\"J. Frank Raley, Jr.: On Higher Education\\", The Slackwater Center, St. Mary's College of Maryland, http://www.smcm.edu/slackwater/onlineexhibits/JFrankRaley/jfreducation.html This also included a campaign by Raley to expand St. Mary's Seminary Junior College into a four-year liberal arts institution. Raley was also noted for supporting integration of St. Mary's County schools\\"St. Mary's College Mourns the Passing of J. Frank Raley\\", Wednesday, August 22, 2012, http://lexleader.net/st-marys-college-mourns-passing-frank-raley/ and elimination of racial segregation. Raley then followed this with years of ongoing, relentless, education-related advocacy on behalf of the county. After extensive lobbying by Raley and others, the Maryland State legislature ordered St. Mary's Junior College expanded to a four-year liberal arts college in 1966 (also dropping the high school grades) and renaming it St. Mary's College of Maryland. {  } By the 1967‚Äì68 academic year, the first four-year students began college studies.Mike Bowler, Baltimore Sun, \\"St. Mary's excellence began with Jackson: Former president writes a memoir about turning the small school into a top-notch public liberal arts college.\\", The Education Beat, November 06, 2002, http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-11-06/news/0211060051_1_jackson-mary- college-college-of-maryland Building projects to expand the campus and to build a new library began in earnest.

The commission was also charged with developing historic interpretation programs for the general public. Although a separate institution from he school, over time, St. Mary's College and Historic st. Mary's City became highly interdependent institutions.\\"Anthropology Department: Historic St. Mary's City\\", St. Mary's College of Maryland describes close and multi-leveled relationship between Historic St. Mary's City and St. Mary's College of Maryland \\"Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland\\", Page 41, Julia King, University of Tennessee Press; July 30, 2012, , For 40 years, St. Mary's College of Maryland and Historic St. Mary's City have jointly operated\\"Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland\\", Page 41, Julia King, University of Tennessee Press; July 30, 2012, , the internationally recognized Historic Archeology Field School,\\"Anthropology Department: Historic St. Mary's City\\", St. Mary's College of Maryland describes close and multi-leveled relationship between Historic St. Mary's City and St. Mary's College of Maryland, which is considered one of the top archeology field schools in the nation.\\"Archaeology, Narrative, and the Politics of the Past: The View from Southern Maryland\\", Page 41, Julia King, University of Tennessee Press; July 30, 2012, , In addition, the two institutions jointly offer year-round classes in hands-on classes in archeology, museum studies, African-American studies, history, and democracy studies. Denzel Washington Jr. in St. Mary's City In 1976 Denzel Washington Jr. played the earliest role of his professional acting career in St. Mary's City in a summer stage theater production\\"St. Mary's: A 'When-did?' Timeline\\", Haugaard, Susan G. Wilkinson; Wilkinson, Susan G.; King, Julia; page 30, when he was 21 years old (he did a two-minute appearance in a prior production, but his role in St. Mary's City was very substantial). He played the role of a real historical figure from colonial St. Mary's City, Mathias de Sousa,\\"Matthias da Sousa: Colonial Maryland's Black, Jewish Assemblyman\\", Susan Rosenfeld Falb, MARYLAND HISTORICAL MAGAZINE, VOL. 73, No. 4, DECEMBER 1978, page 97, http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc5800/sc5881/000001/000000/000293/pdf/msa_sc_5881_1_293.pdf who was possibly African-American and if so, was America's first Black legislator. This affected the course of his career, leading him to take numerous other roles involving historic figures. Denzel Washington Jr. played the earliest role of his professional acting career in St. Mary's City, Maryland when he was 21 years old (he did a two-minute appearance in a prior production, but his role in St. Mary's City was very substantial). During the entire summer season of 1976, he performed in the stage production of \\"Wings of the Morning\\" a historical play about the founding of the Maryland colony and the beginnings of democracy there. Washington played the role of a real historical figure from colonial St. Mary's City, Mathias de Sousa, who was possibly of both African and Portuguese heritage and if so, was America's first Black legislator. This was also Denzel Washington's first role playing a real historical character (although the play itself was fictionalized in order to fill gaps in historical information). The experience led Washington to take on numerous other acting roles involving historic figures. Influence on Washington's acting career This experience had a lasting influence on the course of Washington's acting career, as he later sought out numerous historical roles, including portrayals of Steve Biko, Malcolm X, Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, Herman Boone and Melvin B. Tolson. Washington also later won an Academy Award for his role in the film Glory where he played the part of Private Silas Trip, who served in a United States Colored Troops regiment during the American Civil War. Historic St. Mary's City starts living history program, involving student actors This may have had a lasting influence on Historic St. Mary's as well, although after some debate, the commission at the time discouraged the state for some years afterwards from allowing fictionalized historical theater productions in the historic area. The commission later secured funding for a living history program, including use of period actors in order to interpret area history to the public. The living history program has continued in Historic St. Mary's City for over 30 years, involving students from St. Mary's College of Maryland in acting roles that interpret area history. =1980s: national recognition for school as a \\"prominent Liberal arts college\\"= In the 1980s US and News and World Report magazine began to recognize St. Marys College as a prominent and unique liberal arts college in the public sectorJ.

The school went on to win numerous top national rankings and became nationally recognized. Lewis himself had grown up in a blue collar family in Warwick Rhode Island, his father only had an eighth grade education and so Lewis was in the first generation of his family to attend college. Initially he wasn't able to stay engaged with his studies and he dropped out, but later, after a period of military service, he returned to pursuing an education, following through all the way to obtaining a Doctorate degree and then becoming an educator and later a college administrator. He was also a noted and very prolific poet in his younger days. During his time as president, Lewis oversaw an expansion of the Brent scholars program for first generation college students. He also oversaw a more than doubling of the school's African-American student population from 6% in 1982, to 14% in 1992.\\"Trading Dollars for Independence\\" See section entitled \\"Autonomy Woes\\", Business Officer magazine, National Association of University and College Business Officers, Laurie Stickelmaier, http://www.nacubo.org/Business_Officer_Magazine/Magazine_Archives/April_2004/Trading_Dollars_for_Independence.html During this era, the State Legislature also charged the school with a mission to remain affordable to public education sector students, while offering a Liberal Arts education normally only available at private liberal arts colleges. Growing pains The college struggled to meet this cost containment goal, as it had also been required by the state to grow considerably at the same time, across numerous dimensions, in order to fulfill its new role as the state's public honors college.

A major reason cited is growing tuition and a feeling that the state is not funding the schools adequately. Ivy league schools are also competing heavily for top minority students. First generation college students of all races come from families still recovering from the recession. By spring 2014, the number had rebounded slightly to 8%.

The Malosa mountain range and plateau neighbours the more famous Zomba Plateau and is separated by the Domasi Valley. Malosa is on the M3, 27 km from the city of Zomba. The earth road from the trading post leads from the edge of the main road right up to the base of the Malosa mountain range. History Malosa is dominated by the Anglican Church Mission. Following a request from David Livingstone, the first missionaries arrived away at Magomero in 1861. The Protectorate of Nyasaland was formed in 1891 with only one Anglican diocese (there are now four). A mission station, named Likwenu, after the river flowing from Malosa Mountain, was established on the slopes of the mountain in 1910 and a hospital opened there in 1913. In 1963 Bishop Donald Arden established the headquarters of the Diocese at Malosa, it having previously been on Likoma Island and at Mponda's. In 1971 the Diocese was divided into two, the Diocese of Southern Malawi in the south and the Diocese of Lake Malawi in the centre and north. In 2002 the Diocese of Southern Malawi divided into two and the Diocese of Upper Shire came into being with its headquarters at Malosa. The Right Reverend Bernard Amos Malango became the first Bishop of Upper Shire in 2002 succeeded by the Right Reverend Brighton Vitta Malasa, became Bishop in 2009 and has his diocesan offices at the foot of the mountain. Geography Chilema Tree, Malosa, Malawi Located in Malosa is an area called Chilema. 'Chilema' in Chichewa (the local language) means 'disabled' or 'deformed' and this area gets its name from two natural phenomena. Firstly a stream that starts at the top of Malosa Mountain but as it flows down it gets smaller and disappears at the point of Chilema. Secondly a tree, the Chilema Tree, which is a single tree that looks like an entire forest. It is impossible to find the original trunk of the tree as the whole area is a vast interconnected mesh of woven trunks. For the first few years in the life of the Chilema Ecumenical Lay Training Centre its chapel was under the tree. The stone altar is still there. =Malosa Forest Reserve= Malosa Forest Reserve is a protected forest in Malawi. It is under the authority of The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Management. In 2013 Malosa Forest Reserve became part of a Zomba-Malosa-Liwonde forest management plan, splitting all the forestry reserves into 26 blocks. The Malosa forest blocks are managed by Nkalo Forest Block of Traditional Authority Nkula. =Malosa Mountain and Plateau= Malosa peak stands 6,816 feet and has gently rounded slopes. Malosa plateau lies at 6,000-6,600 feet and is covered in grasses and trees. Walks up the mountain and on the plateau can be found along the paths used by the illegal charcoal producers. On the peaks of the Malosa range you can enjoy views of the Shire river, Lake Chilwa, and the Chikala, Chaone, and Mongolowe hills. There are also lots of interesting insects and flora with butterfly collectors frequently using Malosa mountain to collect specimens. The alkaline pegmatites of the Zomba and Malosa mountains are famous for their unique geology and mineralogy. The mineral specimens of aegirines, arfvedsonite and feldspars are some of the best in the world. Landmarks =Chilema Ecumenical Training and Conference Centre= The Chilema Ecumenical Training and Conference Centre (CETCC), previously known as The United Church Lay Training Centre, is a non profit institution. The CETCC is a dream of the CCAP (Church of Central Africa, Presbyterian) Blantyre Synod and the Anglican Diocese of Malawi, then the Diocese of Southern Malawi. The centres inception dates back to 1962 through the leadership of Reverend Jonathan Sangaya of the CCAP and the Rt. Reverend Bishop Donald Arden of the Anglican Diocese. Land was donated by the Anglican Diocese and is owned by the Trustees of the Centre. The CETCC was officially opened in 1967 although the Capacity Building Leadership Training Programmes started in 1964. =St Luke's Hospital= St Luke's Hospital, Malosa, Malawi The first hospital was opened in 1913 at the site of the Likwenu Mission Station adjoining the Likwenu River. The buildings of the original hospital can still be found in the undergrowth at the foot of the mountain. St Luke's Hospital is located nearer the main road and was established in 1964 by Bishop Donald Arden. His wife Jane drew the plans for all the buildings at the hospital and Nursing School until 1981 and supervised their construction. The population of the catchment area is more than 90,000. The Hospital has 145 general and maternity beds and provides surgery and dental treatment as well as staffing 5 outreach clinics that visit villages on a monthly basis. St Luke's Health Centres: * Chilipa and Nkasala health centres, Zomba District * Mposa and Gawanani health centres, Machinga District * Matope health centre, Neno Districthttp://www.malawipartnership.co.uk/.../Annual_Report_2008-10.doc St Luke's Hospital sits under the umbrella organisation of the Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) which provides 37% of health services in the country and trains up to 80% of its health workers. Controversy In 2008 Tanzania-born Thadeo Mac‚Äôosano was arrested for using unauthorised drugs on 20 patients suffering from incurable tumours. Mac‚Äôosano's application to run the trial for the drugs on humans was rejected in 2006 because he did not adhere to international standards protecting the rights of the patients, however the trials went ahead. =St Luke's College of Nursing and Midwifery= St Luke's College of Nursing and Midwifery, Malosa, Malawi The Anglican Diocese of Southern Malawi opened Malosa Nursing School in 1972 with Miss Augusta Black and her sister Brenda Black as its first tutors. It is now called St Luke's College of Nursing and Midwifery and trains Nurse Midwife Technicians (NMTs) and Community Midwife Technicians (CMTs). The college has over 300 students and sending students for clinical practice to the following healthcare institutions: * St Luke's Hospital Malosa * Machinga District Hospital * Mangochi District Hospital * Balaka District Hospital * Salima District Hospital * Zomba Central Hospital * Zomba Mental Hospital =Malosa Secondary School= Malosa Secondary School is under the Anglican Diocese of the Upper Shire and is a National Grant-Aided Boarding School. It was built in 1928 in the grounds of an old tobacco farm and was initially a teacher training college. The school has a capacity for 700 students studying form 1 through to form 4. Yao tribe The main single tribe found in Malosa is the Yao tribe. The Yao were subsistence farmers on the southeastern coast of Africa where they made contact with Arab settlers. The greater Yao chief Mataka rejected Christianity and accepted Islam. Today the majority of Yao in Malosa still follow Islam. The Yao speak a Bantu language called Chiyao; however they also speak Chichewa, the national language of Malawi.

Th√©ophile-Louis Deyrolle (16 December 1844, Paris - 14 December 1923, Concarneau) was a French painter, illustrator and ceramicist.  Biography  He came from a family of entomologists and naturalists who owned a well-known taxidermy shop in Paris. Achille and √âmile Deyrolle were among his relatives. Originally, he studied architecture at the √âcole des Beaux-arts. While working for Joseph Auguste √âmile Vaudremer, he met Alfred Guillou who convinced him to give up architecture for painting. He then became a student and assistant in the studios of Alexandre Cabanel and William Bouguereau.Museum of Pont Aven: Exhibition notes with biography. (Cached) In 1863, due perhaps to his family's reputation, he was able to travel to Armenia and Georgia on a commission from the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie.Breton Gallery (Milmo-Penny Fine Art): Brief biography (Scroll down) In addition to touring the monuments, he visited the Laz, gaining their trust and producing drawings and descriptions that were published in Le Tour du Monde - Nouveau Journal Des Voyages over the course of several years beginning in 1869. Some of his artist friends at Concarneau also published their versions of his drawings. In 1871, he and Guillou left for Concarneau, Alfred's hometown, with nothing more than they could carry. The next year, he married Alfred's sister Suzanne, becoming a Breton by adoption.Concarneau et Ses Peintres website. Includes more works by Deyrolle. Suzanne Guillous was also an artist. Together, they founded the artists' colony there. Once he became settled there. he began work for HB de Quimper, decorating plates and vases with Japanese motifs. He was also attracted to the life of the port and the maritime trades and became a part- time fishmonger. Most of his paintings deal with the life of the harbor. Many inns and hotels in the area are decorated with his landscapes and pastoral scenes.

It is developed to replace the Suzuki SX4 sedan in several Asian, African and Latin American markets. It went on sale for the first time in India, the largest market for Suzuki in September 2014. It is currently the larger sedan of two sedans currently produced by Suzuki, the other being the Dzire. Overview The Ciaz was previewed as the Suzuki Ciaz Concept in 2014 Auto Expo India. It was also revealed in the Beijing Motor Show in April 2014 as the Suzuki Alivio, in a near-production guise. Launched in September 2014, the Suzuki Ciaz is one of the largest car in the segment with 4,490 mm in length, 1,730 mm in width, 1,485 mm in height. The car sits on a 2,650 mm wheelbase which is said to be C-segment territory, although Suzuki positioned the Ciaz against the B-segment sedans in most markets. The boot space of 510-litres and it is claimed to be the largest in its class. The Ciaz name stands for Comfort, Intelligence, Attitude and Zeal or City from A to Z.  Markets  = India = In India, the Ciaz replaced the SX4 sedan which was marketed in the country simply as the Maruti Suzuki SX4. Released to the market in October 2014, the Ciaz belongs to the B-segment sedan market which is commonly referred as a 'mid- size sedan' category in the country, as opposed to the 'compact sedan' which is typically less than 4 meter in length. Maruti Suzuki was targeting the Ciaz as the market leader in the category while also attempting to expand the segment sales volume. The Ciaz was initially available with two engines ‚Äì 1.4-litre 4-cylinder K14B with and along with a Fiat Multijet 1.3-litre 4-cylinder diesel rated at and of torque. The diesel model is rated at while the petrol variant is claimed to be able to do per ARAI standards. Maruti Suzuki claimed it has tweaked the ECU and mapped throttle response differently for the petrol Ciaz for better performance and efficiency. The petrol engine is available with 4-speed automatic and 5-speed manual, while the diesel one is available only in 5-speed manual. In September 2015, the mild-hybrid version of the diesel Ciaz was launched. Marketed as the SHVS (Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki), the fuel economy is improved by employing an ISG (integrated starter generator) that offers engine power assistance using the motor. The ISG also provides assistance to the engine start-stop technology that automatically stops the engine during traffic light, and starts when the clutch is released. The claimed fuel economy is improved to . Since April 2017, Maruti Suzuki moved the Ciaz sales and distribution from the regular Arena dealerships to NEXA dealerships, a network of dealership outlets for Maruti Suzuki high-end models. Since its inception in 2015, the dealership network previously only offered the S-Cross and Baleno. The Ciaz has sold over 270,000 units in India since its launch up to September 2019. The top-end Alpha trim contributes to more than 54 percent of the total sales for the sedan, while the Nexa Blue colour was picked by over 30 percent of Ciaz customers.  Facelift  In August 2018, the Ciaz received its first facelift. It ditched the 1.4-litre K14B petrol engine in favour of the larger 1.5-litre K15B engine with SHVS producing a power output of . Later in March 2019, the Fiat-sourced diesel engine was replaced with the in-house 1.5-litre E15A diesel engine rated at and of torque paired with a 6-speed manual transmission. This diesel engine is short-lived as it was discontinued in February 2020 due to the implementation of Bharat Stage 6 emission standards. = Thailand = Suzuki Ciaz RS (facelift) The Ciaz was launched in Thailand in July 2015. Manufactured in the Rayong facility, it is equipped with a K12B 1.2-litre engine with paired with a CVT automatic transmission to conform with the Eco Car regulation that promises tax breaks for economical cars. Suzuki claimed the Ciaz could achieve and CO2 levels less than 120 g/km. The Rayong plant also produced the Ciaz with the K14B 1.4-litre for exports. The facelifted version was launched to the market in March 2020. = China = The car was launched to the market in January 2015 as the Suzuki Alivio. Manufactured and marketed by Changan Suzuki, the Alivio is powered by a 1.6-litre G-INNOTEC engine that produces and , paired with a 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmission. The facelifted version was unveiled in October 2017, with a unique styling that is not applied to the global version of the Ciaz.

In yeast, septins form a ring structure, to which other proteins are recruited. In particular, chitinase 2 is required, an enzyme that synthesises chitin thereby building up the primary septum. A secondary septum of Œ≤-glucans and mannoproteins is then assembled using the enzyme 1,3-Beta-glucan synthase, and the primary septum degraded during cell separation. After degradation of the primary septum, a chitinous bud scar remains on both the mother and daughter cell.  Composition  In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the primary septum is composed of linear Œ≤(1,3)-D-glucan, Œ≤(1,6) branches, and Œ±(1,3)-D-glucan. The secondary septum in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is composed of Œ≤(1,6)-D-glucan, Œ≤(1,6) branches, and Œ±(1,3)-D-glucan. The synthesis of linear Œ≤(1,3)-D-glucan for the primary septum is done by the enzyme Œ≤(1,3)-D-glucan synthase and regulated by a Rho GTPase. Ags1/Mok1 enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of Œ±(1,3)-D-glucan in the primary septum and secondary septum.

The Wave: Bristol was opened in 2019, on the northern outskirts of Bristol, and a second site, The Wave: London , is planned.https://www.leevalleypark.org.uk/en/content/cms/corporate/enhancing- the-valley/the-wave/  The Wave, Bristol  The founder of the project is Nick Hounsfield. The project was named \\"The Wave: Bristol\\" in 2012, initially focussing on a site next to the Portway in Bristol, but rejected it as not big enough. A site on farmland at Easter Compton was selected in 2013, with the technology generating the artificial waves to be supplied by the Spanish company Wavegarden. In August 2017, South Gloucestershire Council approved the ¬£20 million scheme, which is designed for sustainability. Besides the wave pool, the scheme will include a natural swimming lake, barefoot trails, foraging areas and gardens of various types - activity, sensory, healing, culinary and herb gardens. Other proposed features include a clubhouse, a surf shop, a ropes and tunnels course and a campsite. The planned dimensions of the pool are long by wide and deep. The firm plans to host a High-Performance Surfing Centre and surf contests. In June 2015 it was decided to use the American company Wave Loch's wave generation technology instead of Wavegarden's, requiring the opening date to be put back to 2016. However, as of May 2017, they reverted to the Wavegarden's technology. In April 2016, The Wave announced that South Gloucestershire Council had approved the revised designs. With the switch back to Wavegarden, the planning permission was resubmitted, and approved in late August 2017. In October 2019 construction was completed.

Created by the February Patent issued by Emperor Franz Joseph I on 26 February 1861, it existed until the end of World War I and the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy, when on 12 November 1918 the transitional National Assembly of German-Austria declared it abolished. It was superseded by the Federal Council of the Austrian Parliament implemented by the 1920 Federal Constitutional Law. History First attempts to establish a Reichsrat advisory committee had been undertaken by the 1860 October Diploma. As Emperor Franz Joseph's position was weakened by the Second Italian War of Independence and the loss of Lombardy, the Austrian minister-president Count Johann Bernhard von Rechberg und Rothenl√∂wen sought for a close alliance with the haute bourgeoisie. However, the liberal-minded citizens demanded a parliamentary constitution which finally was promulgated by the 1861 February Patent. Elaborated under Count Rechberg's successor Archduke Rainer and State Minister Anton von Schmerling, it gave way for the transition of Austria to a constitutional monarchy. The newly established bicameral legislature of the Imperial Council included the House of Lords, meant as a class-oriented council to counterbalance the lower House of Deputies, which were sent by the provincial assemblies (Landtage). The Patent was rejected in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, which demanded its own constitution. This eventually led to the creation of the sovereign Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen in 1867. House of Lords session at the Palais Nieder√∂sterreich, 1868 The House of Lords met for the first time on 29 April 1861 at the Palais Nieder√∂sterreich in Vienna's Herrengasse, its venue until the Austrian Parliament Building on the Ringstrasse boulevard was completed. The first session at the new location was held on 4 December 1883. The House of Lords chamber of debates was severely damaged in World War II. Restored in a modern style, it is today is the meeting place of the National Council, the lower house of the Austrian Parliament. The Hungarian magnates refused to send members to the Austrian House of Lords and insisted on their own parliamentary assembly. Their requests were initially denied by Minister Schmerling (\\"Austria can wait\\"), nevertheless, on the eve of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the inaugural session of the second legislature took place on 20 May 1867 without Hungarian representatives even being called. Half a year later, the Diet of Hungary () was re-established by the December Constitution, including a House of Representatives as well as a House of Magnates (F≈ërendih√°z), while the Reichsrat legislature was only responsible for the Cisleithanian crown lands. Those common affairs which related to the whole Dual Monarchy, such as foreign policy, national defence and finances, were examined by parliamentary delegations of 60 MPs each; one third of the Austrian delegates were elected by the House of Lords. In December 1906, the members of the House of Lords led by Archduke Franz Ferdinand bitterly opposed the implementation of universal male suffrage, initiated by the Austrian government of Minister-president Baron Max Wladimir von Beck to meet the demands of the Social Democrats under Victor Adler. Beck could win the support by Emperor Franz Joseph, who sent his Grand Masters of the Court Prince Rudolf of Liechtenstein and Prince Alfred of Montenuovo to plead for the electoral reform in parliament. The proposal was finally approved and applied to the Cisleithanian legislative elections of 1907 and 1911. During the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the last session of the House of Lords was held on 30 October 1918. The last Austrian Minister-president Heinrich Lammasch announced that his cabinet, appointed by Emperor Charles I on 27 October, would make no policy statement, whereupon the meeting was adjourned by Speaker Prince Alfred III of Windisch-Gr√§tz after only five minutes. At the same time, the Provisional National Assembly of German-Austria met at the Palais Nieder√∂sterreich and implemented the government of State Chancellor Karl Renner. The House of Lords chamber of the Parliament Building was destroyed by bombing during World War II. It was rebuilt in a contemporary style, and today serves as the chamber of the Austrian National Council. Membership Austrian Parliament building (c. 1900) Unlike the elected House of Deputies, most new members of the House of Lords were appointed. Membership of the House of Lords was made up of: #the appointed Archdukes of the ruling House of Habsburg-Lorraine #the Austrian archbishops and bishops of princely rank (similar to the Lords Spiritual of the United Kingdom) #the heads of the wealthy and landed noble dynasties entitled by the Emperor of Austria (similar to hereditary peers) #Austrian citizens appointed for life by the emperor for their services to the state or church, science or art (similar to life peers). There were a number of spiritual peers who sat in the House by virtue of their ecclesiastical role in the established Roman Catholic church, as well as Greek Catholic Church. Beside the archdukes of the imperial family, the entitled secular nobles made up the rest of the membership; of these, the majority were hereditary peers. A smaller number of life peers were appointed by the monarch on the nominal advice of the Austrian Minister-President, or on the advice of the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Membership was a birthright of all hereditary peers. The number of members was not fixed, though a law enacted in 1907 decreed that the category of life peers shall comprise at least 150 and no more than 170 seats. Bills could be introduced into either the House of Lords or the House of Deputies. Members of the Lords were also allowed to take on roles as government ministers. The House of Lords had its own support services, separate from the Deputies, including the House of Lords Library. The House of Lords scrutinised bills that had been approved by the House of Deputies and regularly reviewed and amended them. While it was unable to prevent bills passing into law, except in certain limited circumstances, it could delay them and force the Deputies to reconsider their decisions. In this capacity, the Lords acted as a check on the House of Deputies that was independent from the electoral process. The Emperor's Speech was delivered in the Hofburg Palace during the State Opening of Parliament. The initial plan to hold the opening ceremonies in the atrium hall of the parliament building was not realised. Composition =Spiritual members= According to the 1861 February Patent and its 1867 amendments, 18 members of the Cisleithanian clergy sat in the House of Lords, regardless of their religious denomination: *the Roman Catholic prince-archbishops of Vienna, Prague, Salzburg, G√∂rz, and Olm√ºtz *the Roman Catholic archbishops of Lemberg and Zara, the Greek Catholic archbishop of Lemberg, the Armenian Catholic archbishop of Lemberg, and the Greek Orthodox archbishop of Czernowitz *the Roman Catholic prince-bishops of Brixen, Breslau (for the episcopal territory in Austrian Silesia), Krakau, Seckau, Trient, Laibach, Lavant, and Gurk. =Hereditary members= 106 families had hereditary membership in the House of Lords. These were: Three sovereign houses: * Liechtenstein * Saxe-Coburg and Gotha * Schaumburg-Lippe Sixteen mediatised princely houses: * Lobkowitz * Dietrichstein * Auersperg * F√ºrstenberg * Schwarzenberg * Thurn und Taxis * Colloredo * Khevenh√ºller * Hohenlohe-Langenburg * Starhemberg * Salm-Raitz * Orsini-Rosenberg * Sch√∂nburg-Hartenstein * Metternich * Windisch-Graetz * Trauttmansdorff Sixteen other princely houses: * Dietrichstein * Lubomirski * Porcia * Lamberg * Kinsky * Clary * Paar * Czartoryski * Sanguszko * Rohan * Windisch-Graetz * Collalto * Sapieha * Montenuovo * Beaufort * Thun Four mediatised countships: * Sch√∂nborn * Wurmbrand * Kuefstein * Harrach Sixty-four other countships: Schlik, Lodron, Hardegg, Montecuccoli, Thurn und Valsassina, Buquoy, Tarnowski, Althann, Czernin, Waldstein, Thun, Attems, Des Fours, Herberstein, Nostitz, Ungnad von Wei√üenwolff, Vetter, Traun, Brandis, Trapp, Ser√©nyi, Sternberg, Kaunitz, Lamberg, Kolowrat, Hoyos, Kinsk√Ω, Falkenhayn, Go√´ss, K√°lnoky, Wratislaw, Zierotin, Podstatzky, Haugwitz, Potocki, Go≈Çuchowski, Lanckoro≈Ñski, Lewicki, Westphalen, Mensdorff, Miniscalchi, Papafava, Meran, Badeni, Colleoni, Venier, Vrints, F√ºnfkirchen, Widmann-Sedlnitzky, Dobr≈æensk√Ω, Walterskirchen, Gudenus, Sedlnitzky, Ludwigstorff, and Wassilko von Serecki Nine baronial families: * Walterskirchen * Locatelli * Dalberg * Kotz * Hackelberg * Gudenus * Sternbach * Ludwigstorff * Wassilko von Serecki Three margravial families: * Canossa * Cavriani * Guidi In 1911, there were fourteen princes of the Imperial family, eighteen bishops, ninety hereditary peers, and 169 life peers. These were exclusively men. Some members of the House of Lords appointed as life peers include glass tycoon Ludwig Lobmeyr, cotton tycoon Nikolaus Dumba, Styrian poet Peter Rosegger, and brewery owner Anton Dreher. The House of Lords was presided over by a president, who was supported by two vice-presidents. From 1907, members of the House of Lords could stand for election to the House of Deputies. Nobles that did not sit in the House of Lords were always able to be elected to the House of Deputies. Presidency Anton von Schmerling, President of the House of Lords from 1871, painting by Friedrich von Amerling According to the 1861 February Patent, the presiding committee of the House of Lords was made up of the president and his deputies, always aristocratic members who were appointed by the emperor at the beginning of a new legislative session. The emperor also had the exclusive right to recall the presidium, which never happened throughout the years of the House's existence. The meetings were alternately chaired by the board members, temporarily acting as President of the House of Lords. =Presidents= *Karl Wilhelm 8th Prince of Auersperg (8 April 1861 - 31 December 1867) *Josef 4th Prince of Colloredo-Mansfeld (31 January 1868 - 15 May 1869) *Karl Wilhelm 8th Prince of Auersperg (88 December 1869 - 21 May 1870) *Count Franz of Kuefstein (13 September 1870 - 1 March 1871) *Karl Wilhelm 8th Prince of Auersperg (21 December 1871 - 17 May 1879) *Anton Ritter von Schmerling (14 February 1871 - 10 August 1871) *Ferdinand Hereditary Count of Trauttmansdorff-Weinsberg (30 September 1879 - 12 December 1896) *Alfred III, Prince of Windisch-Gr√§tz (25 March 1897 - 12 November 1918)Index der Stenographischen Protokolle des Reichsrates, XII.

He is CEO of Aurigny Air Services, having previously been CEO of Baboo, LIAT and Head of Aviation Consulting at Deloitte. Early life and career Darby attended Hurstpierpoint College, King's School, Rochester and the University of Brighton. Between Laker Airways as a planning engineer before moving to fulfil the same position at British Caledonian in 1984. Subsequently, he moved to British Airways in 1988 and a year later became Director Technical Services at Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc. (SH&E;). In 1996, Darby joined Deloitte as Head of Aviation Consulting. He moved to IBM Global Services as a consultant before founding his own company in July 2002, Aviation Strategy Consultants, where he led the initial phase of the launch of Air Arabia. In 2003, Darby joined Unisys as a managing partner before leaving for Antigua to replace Garry Cullen as chief executive officer (CEO) of the Caribbean inter-island airline LIAT in June 2006. =LIAT CEO= Upon arrival at LIAT, Darby was given the mandate to transform a \\"bankrupt and inefficient regional airline that was losing EC$80 million (US$30 million) a year\\" by the Board and a demand by the shareholder islands to not \\"come back for more cash\\", having absorbed US$72.7m between that time and 2001. In January 2007, Darby announced a proposed merger with Caribbean Star Airlines, with which LIAT had been engaged in intense competition since 2005. However, in June 2007 the shareholder governments of Barbados, Antigua & St Vincent gave the go- ahead to the Board of Directors to buy out Caribbean Star instead. LIAT purchased Caribbean Star Airlines on 24 October 2007 and five of Caribbean Star's Bombardier Dash 8-300 aircraft were transferred to LIAT. The airline broke even in 2007 and the following year made a small profit. However, Darby faced extensive challenges at LIAT. Alongside high operating costs, air travel taxes comprising more than 40% of airfares, small populations with low GDP per capita and the lack of ability to fund Public Service Obligation subsidies for marginal routes, a workforce of 900 had eleven separate trade unions and had suffered from poor morale due to the consequent threat of bankruptcy from cash-flow problems for several years prior to Darby's arrival. Furthermore, he had not anticipated the complexity of three islands with limited budgets having stakes in the airline, with resultant necessity for consensus in decision-making and \\"lack of clear shareholder direction\\". However, in April 2009 Darby was dismissed from LIAT over a dispute surrounding his decision to compensate workers for going beyond the call of duty, saying the payments to staffers were not exorbitant and were in the range of EC$1,000 - EC$2,000 (US$375-US$750) a month. The board claimed he had acted above his authority; he later sued successfully for unfair dismissal. He described his three years at LIAT as \\"fascinating and hard work, but rewarding\\". =Fly Baboo CEO= After a year working on various airline and air transport consultancy projects at Aviation Strategy Consultants, Darby was appointed by its shareholder (Lebanese investment group, M1) as CEO of Baboo in March 2010 with a mandate to stemm its losses. Having expanded just as the late-2000s recession began to take hold, the airline had faced harsh competition from its Geneva base from easyJet Switzerland (especially on routes to Bordeaux, Nice, Rome and Toulouse). Having incurred an average load factor across the airline of below 50% between January and July 2010, Darby oversaw the suspension of routes between Geneva and London, Naples, Milan and Marseille as well as a winter seasonal service between Geneva and Oxford. In October 2010, Darby announced that the airline planned to return three of its Embraer E190 aircraft to their lessors by the end of November 2010. Darby entered into negotiations with Lugano-based Darwin Airline to sell the remaining parts of Baboo - the Geneva- based turboprop operation. On 25 November 2010, Darwin confirmed its plans to take over this remaining part of Baboo in early 2011. Once this transition was completed, the company was closed in the Autumn of 2011. =Aurigny Air Services CEO= Whilst spending a further year working at his own company (Aviation Strategy Consultants) on several consultancy projects including working with the SH&E; team on the turnaround of Bahrain-based Gulf Air, Darby was appointed a non-executive director of Aurigny Air Services in September 2011 alongside Gavin St Pier and Michael Richards. In April 2013, he replaced Malcolm Hart with immediate effect as interim CEO of Aurigny but in September 2013 took up the position full-time. After Flybe announced in May 2013 that it would withdraw from London Gatwick as of March 2014, it became apparent that Aurigny would be the sole operator on Guernsey's lifeline Gatwick route. Darby oversaw a review of fleet options to carry an additional 250,000 passengers per annum on the route, an order for a 122-seat Embraer 195 jet aircraft realised in ten months (compared to the industry average of around a minimum of two years) entering service in June 2014 as the first jet aircraft operated by Aurigny in the airline's history and also additional legal protection for Aurigny's sole operator status on the route in the face of potential competition from easyJet. Aside from work to secure the Gatwick route, in a move reflecting his previous work to allow co-operation between LIAT and Caribbean Star, Darby also oversaw a codeshare agreement on the Guernsey- Jersey route between Aurigny and competitor Blue Islands which (when it came into force on 16 March 2014) saw the former stop operating flights between the two islands for the first time since 1969. In January 2016, Aurigny and Blue Islands announced the contract for the codeshare would not be renewed, after Blue Islands became a franchise partner with Flybe and restrictions on the latter's inter-island operation were lifted by the States of Guernsey the previous year. Furthermore, following a successful trial in November 2013, Darby led efforts to replace the forty-year-old Britten-Norman Trislander fleet with Dornier 228s to serve routes from Alderney and to France, as well as overseeing the launch of new year-round routes to London City and Leeds Bradford as well as seasonal links to Barcelona, Norwich and London Luton. Darby envisages that Aurigny's Embraer 195 as well as its sole operator status on its flagship Gatwick route helped it towards profit in 2016. In 2017, following the delayed arrival of the second Dornier 228'NG' aircraft, Darby was finally able to decommission the last Trislander aircraft out of the fleet. In 2018 he oversaw the launch of a new web sales platform that was developed by the company to provide its customers with a much improved user experience and greater operational flexibility. It also facilitated the development of further self-help tools for customers as well as permitting increased ancillary revenues. Also in 2018, Darby negotiated the purchase of 3 new ATR 72-600 aircraft equipped with 'Clearvision' technology. The acquisition was funded by a loan from RBSI. The aircraft were delivered in late 2019. In 2020, Darby led the company through the Covid-19 pandemic, developing tactics and initiatives aimed at helping the business remain operationally ready throughout the crisis. Recognising an opportunity, he was instrumental in developing an 'airbridge' between Covid-free Guernsey and Isle of Man - providing the opportunity for 7000 islanders to travel between the islands on short-break holidays. In August 2020 it was announced that Darby had informed the Board of Aurigny (in February 2020) of his decision to retire in the spring of 2021.

He was considered to be a newaza expert, although was also famed by his tachiwaza as well. He was an early promoter of the kosen judo circuit. Biography Isogai was born in Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, on October 26, 1871. He was the eldest son of , hanshi of Sekiguchi-ry≈´ j≈´jutsu in Nobeoka. In 1891, he moved to Tokyo and joined the Kodokan where he studied judo under Yokoyama Sakujiro. In 1893, he became judo teacher at third high school in Kyoto, as well as the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, where he competed against several local jujutsu masters. One of his best known victories was against Takenouchi-ryu master Kotaro Imai in 1897 via hane makikomi. In 1899, he was appointed professor of judo at Butoku Kai. He is often attributed the creation of the hane goshi throw, although the move can be actually traced back to Yamashita Yoshitsugu.Toshiro Daigo, Wurftechniken des Kodokan Judo He was famous for his rivalry with Fusen-ry≈´ master Mataemon Tanabe, who was known for defeating multiple judokas in challenge matches thanks to his ne- waza mastery. They fought twice in Kyoto and Fukuoka in 1899, ending in a draw in both bouts.Christian Quidet, La fabuleuse histoire des Arts MartiauxRaisuke Kudo, Japanese Judo: Hidden Records, 1972, The second fight was specially notable, as Isogai, knowing the field of strength of his adversary, kept the fight standing and threatened him several times with his skill at hane goshi. Still, Isogai was left convinced of the importance of working on ne-waza in order to be a complete fighter. Isogai and Tanabe fought a third and last time in May 1900, as Mataemon challenged him to met him on a match in an exhibition in Okayama. It would be an uneven fight for Hajime, as Okayama was headquarters for several jujutsu schools opposed to the Kodokan, and the referee of the fight would be Isogai's old enemy Kotaro Imai himself. However, this time Isogai had perfected his ne-waza with Kaichiro Samura, a judoka expert in groundfighting who had come from Takeuchi Santo-ry≈´ and worked as Hajime's assistant trainer at the Butoku Kai. When Isogai and Tanabe met on the tatami, both descended to the ground and began a grappling contest. Though initially even, the match started to be gradually controlled by Isogai, who neutralized all of Tanabe's movements and impeded him to try submissions or reversals. Attempting to force a restart to rethink his strategy, Tanabe dragged them both towards the bounds of the tatami, but Hajime saw his intention and dragged them back again while Tanabe's followers cried for a stoppage. At the end, Imai declared the fight a draw. Isogai was promoted to tenth dan, the highest rank in judo, on December 22, 1937. He was the second person to be awarded this grade and the first living person to be presented with it. \\\\- References Category:1871 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Miyazaki Prefecture Category:Japanese male judoka ","title":"Hajime Isogai"},{"id":"43675266","text":"Mariya Yefimovna Sergeyenko (9 December 1891 ‚Äì 28 October 1987) was a Soviet scholar of Roman history and philologist (Professor from 1948).

Early life  Director, screenwriter and producer Leslie Harris was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1960. Harris grew up with a love of film and the arts which prompted her to pursue a degree from Denison University, earning a B.F.A. in Studio Arts. She also studied abroad in Aix-En-Provence, France during her junior year. Her early film work consisted of animations and live action shorts. Harris moved to New York in 1982 where she began working in the advertising industry, including for major advertising firms such as FCB and Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide (both members of the American Association of Advertising Agencies). Harris soon grew frustrated with the limits of the advertising industry and moved into directing commercials. Harris established her own commercials company catering to the small business community such as the \\"Exceptional Women of Color Hair Salon\\". Harris took on temp work to pay the bills, writing her feature screenplays in between answering phone calls. She also worked evenings at \\"Film/Video Arts\\", a nonprofit film and video rental and post-production facility where she had access to equipment she could use to create her films. Harris attributes her mother‚Äôs advice, motivation, and encouragement from a young age to her success: her mother always insisted that women can achieve any career goal. Spike Lee's tenacity and success as a black feature filmmaker also inspired her to continue pursuing her goals within the film industry. With her 1992 film Just Another Girl on the I.R.T., Leslie Harris became the first African-American woman director, writer, producer and executive producer to win a Special Jury Prize at The Sundance Film Festival for Best Feature Film. Harris has lectured on filmmaking and film at esteemed institutions such as Tulane University, Wellesley College, Portland State University, Columbia University and the Canadian Film Institute to name just a few. Harris has also taught both screenwriting and film production classes as both a full-time and adjunct professor at New York University Tisch School of the Arts.  Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.  In an interview with Charlie Rose in 1993, Harris discussed her frustration with most mainstream coming-of-age films. This genre of film is important for young people, but most films of this type are about young men, while young women are portrayed as just an appendage to the central male character ‚Äî either a girlfriend, wife or mother. Harris wanted to see a young African-American woman's coming-of-age story, from a female perspective, and set out to make it herself, stating that it's important that we see women both in front of and behind the camera. The story of Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. was well-researched with the help of The Brooklyn Teen Pregnancy Center; Harris conducted interviews with counselors, teen mothers and teen fathers and the screenplay was written and rewritten over the course of a year and a half before being shot in only 17 days. The film received funding via grants from National Endowments for the Arts, American Film Institute, New York State Council on the Arts, Brooklyn Arts Council and was distributed by Miramax on 200 screens in the U.S. and 20 other countries worldwide. In 2013 92YTribeca held a 20th anniversary screening of the film, followed by a Q&A; panel with Leslie Harris. Harris wrote, \\"What a great turn out at the 92nd St Y Tribeca! Thank you to all the fans of the film! It meant a great deal to me that 'Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.' has such a loyal audience and wasn't forgotten. Let's not forget the contributions of Black Women in the history of the Indie Film World\\". On October 23, 2015, a fan on Twitter asked Harris \\"Can we get a sequel to Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.?\\" Harris replied \\"Yes! I'm working on it!\\" The fan used the hashtag \\"trailblazingwomenincinema\\".  Women in film  In the early 1990s, Harris established her own production company and raised funds herself for her award-winning feature film Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. As sole executive producer and owner of her own production company \\"Truth 24 FPS Productions\\", Harris was the first African-American woman to negotiate a deal with a major motion picture company, Miramax Films, for theatrical release in over 200 screens across the U.S. Harris is adamant that women‚Äîespecially African-American and women of color‚Äîhave a voice in the theatrical motion picture industry, both in front of and behind the camera. Harris contends that historically, women have not been viewed as having the ability to control the finances necessary to operate, budget and manage a film. Therefore, it was important for her to do so with Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.

After Cadwell studied medicine in Vermont, he married a daughter of Matthew Lyon. He left with Lyon to Kentucky, but then settled in the Indiana Territory after a dispute about slavery. He served in the government of Madison County, then was elected to the Illinois Senate when the state was founded in 1818. He served three two-year terms, then resumed the practice of medicine. Biography George Cadwell was born on February 21, 1773, in Wethersfield, Connecticut. He attended school in Hartford, Connecticut and then studied medicine in Rutland, Vermont. Cadwell married Pamelia Lyon, the daughter of Matthew Lyon in 1797. He settled with her family in Fair Haven, Vermont. He helped her father publish The Scourge of Aristocracy and Repository of Important Political Truth, a paper attacking U.S. president John Adams. The Alien and Sedition Acts forced the family to flee the state, and in 1799, they settled at what is now Eddyville, Kentucky. Matthew Lyon became a prosperous slave trader, which disappointed the anti- slavery Cadwell and his brother-in-law John Messinger. Messinger and Cadwell left Lyon in 1802 to settle in the Indiana Territory. Cadwell purchased opposite Gaboret Island on the Mississippi River, about north of Cahokia, in what is now St. Clair County, Illinois. He built a cabin, farmed, and practiced medicine. Cadwell was appointed a justice of the peace for St. Clair County on July 9, 1809. When Madison County, Illinois Territory was created in 1812, which included his farm, Cadwell was named a justice for that county. In August 1813, he was named commissioner of the county court of common pleas, responsible for managing taxes. That December, he was appointed judge of the same court. The next December, he was appointed Judge of the Madison County Court. Cadwell then moved to Edwardsville after purchasing land from Thomas Kirkpatrick. After Illinois was admitted as a state in 1818, Cadwell was elected to the 1st Illinois General Assembly as a state senator. In December 1820, he was named President pro tempore of the senate after Lieutenant Governor Pierre Menard requested a leave of absence. He resigned the next month. He was re-elected in 1820 and moved near what is now Lynnville, at the time still a part of Madison County. During this session, Greene County, Illinois, was created. Cadwell's farm now stood in the new county, so he represented it when elected to the next general assembly. He was also considered a representative of the new Pike County. After the 3rd General Assembly, Cadwell purchased a plot of land in Morgan County. The land was largely timbered and Cadwell harvested sugar and syrup until the 1850s. He platted part of his claim as the town of Quincy, hoping to secure the location of the county seat. However, the county commissioners instead settled on Jacksonville. Cadwell spent the rest of his practicing medicine as the first physician in Morgan County. He built the first frame house in the county and created the Morganian Society, an anti-slavery group. He was named the first postmaster in the county. Cadwell had two sons and eight daughters; both sons died before adulthood. He died in Morgan County on August 1, 1826 and was buried in Diamond Grove Cemetery in Jacksonville. He was the great-grandfather of state senator Epler Cadwell Mills.

It is endemic to Madagascar's northwestern coast where it is only known from Ankarafa Forest, a forest fragment in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park. Description Boophis ankarafensis are small frogs: adult males measure and female (one specimen) in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is slender, with the head much wider than the body. The background colour of dorsum and limbs is light green, but the webbing, finger, and toe disks are green-yellow. There are speckles of reddish-brown and yellow pigment covering the dorsum and limbs, and thin yellow dorsolateral stripes running from behind the eye to the forelimb, then fading towards the mid-body. There is some reddish-brown pigment that forms a band between the eyes and covers the supra-ocular area (interspersed with yellow speckling), as well as forming a faint rostral stripe between the eye and nose tip. Habitat and conservation Most individuals that have been encountered were males calling along the banks of two streams during nighttime. They were calling from vegetation about 0.5‚Äì2 m high, typically close to each other. Most females were observed in amplexing pairs, but one female was found in a tree during the day approximately 3 m high and 30 m from a stream. Boophis ankarafensis has only been found in intact forest, and it appears to be sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance. The species has not yet been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but it is suggested that is should be classified as \\"Critically Endangered\\" because the area of occupancy of this species is small (probably less than 10 km¬≤), it is not known from outside the Ankarafa Forest, and this forest fragment is experiencing widespread deforestation.

She was an outspoken pacifist in Toronto during World War I (1914‚Äì18). Towards the end of the war she married and moved to Chicago, where she was active in numerous civic causes for the rest of her life, notably fighting for women's rights and for improvements to education. Family Laura Hughes was born in Toronto, Canada in 1886. She was the daughter of James Laughlin Hughes and Adaline Marean Hughes, two well known educators and reformers in Toronto. Her father was chief inspector of the schools in Toronto and her mother was the first kindergarten teacher in Toronto. James Hughes supported the temperance movement, opposed corporal punishment in schools and was a strong believer in hygiene. He passionately supported the British Empire, and launched the cadet movement in Canadian public schools. Her uncle was Sir Sam Hughes, Minister of Militia during World War I. As a young woman Laura Hughes worked in a mill, and then published a paper that described the abusive working conditions she had found. Based on her experience, she campaigned for reforms to labor laws. She co-founded the Canadian Labour Party. World War I International Congress of Women in 1915. left to right:1.

Louise Keilhau - Norway Laura Hughes was active in the pacifist movement during World War I. Her uncle Sir Sam Hughes \\"offered her a half section of prairie land if she would give up her interest in peace work.\\" She refused. She attended the Women's Peace Conference at The Hague in 1915. At this meeting the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace was established, with the American Jane Addams as president. Many Canadian women declined to attend, finding that their loyalty to the Empire was stronger than their attachment to pacifism. The press accused women who did attend of having \\"fallen under the influence of the German plotters at the alleged peace conference. After returning from Europe, Hughes and other feminists joined with the Toronto Suffrage Association and the Women's Social- Democratic League to establish the Canadian Women's Peace Party (WPP). Co- founders of the WPP were Elsie Charlton and Alice Amelia Chown. The WPP was affiliated with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Hughes was an organizer for the Canadian branch of the WILPF. In late October 1916 she wrote that the Canadian branch of the ICWPP was active in every province of Canada apart from British Columbia. Hughes was unusual in claiming that the drive for profits was keeping the war alive. Unlike other pacifist women, she seems to have avoided using maternal feminist arguments. Hughes wrote pessimistically in 1916, Hughes became associated with the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Hughes spoke publicly against conscription into the armed forces when this became an issue in 1917, and was praised for her stance by the SDPC. Many feminists were opposed to pacifism. Woman's Century responded in late summer 1917 to a report that Hughes and Harriet Dunlop Prenter, described as \\"prominent suffragists\\", had drawn a link between suffrage and pacifism in Ontario. According to the editor, Jessie Campbell MacIver, \\"National Union and Ontario Equal Franchise Association have again and again expressed themselves as repudiating utterly any question of premature peace. Any pacifist literature which has been received from the Hague and elsewhere has been consigned by these societies to the waste-paper basket.\\" Hughes and Prenter seem to have been engaged in a struggle to lead the women's pacifists in Toronto. Chicago In December 1917 Laura Hughes married Erling Lunde of Chicago, a conscientious objector, and moved to Chicago. By November 1918 she was a new mother. She was to have two sons, Chester and Leif. Hughes' husband was imprisoned for his stance until the fall of 1920. Laura worked to support conscientious objectors in 1918‚Äì20, assisted by her father-in-law. Laura Lunde spent much time teaching women about their rights and responsibilities as citizens. She also set herself the task of \\"chasing good government.\\" She and Jane Addams became close friends. Lunde campaigned for laws to regulate child labor, job security for teachers, state assistance for education and electoral reforms. Laura became educational chairman of the Illinois League of Women Voters. She took an active role in the City Club of Chicago. She chaired state committees such as the Joint Committee on Voting Machines and the Illinois Committee for Eradication of Tuberculosis. In 1939 women gained the right to serve on juries in Illinois. Lunde was the first female foreman of a Federal Grand Jury in the state. She was a member of the \\"Big 19\\" in the early 1950s, a lobby group that pushed local government to fight organized crime. She became president of the Civil Service Reform Association. She was involved in organizations such as the Joint Committee on School Affairs, Cook County Health District, Illinois Conference on Legislation, Illinois Civic Exchange and the Illinois State Library. Laura Hughes Lunde died in 1966. The Ebinger School in Edison Park, Chicago dedicated its Learning Resource Room to her.

Undersea cables In 1852, Canning turned to submarine telegraphy, and with Messrs. Glass & Elliot laid in 1855‚Äì6 his first cable: it connected Cape Breton Island with Newfoundland. In 1857 he assisted Charles Bright in the construction and laying of the first Atlantic cable, and he was on board HMS Agamemnon during the submerging of the cable in 1857 and 1858. Following 1865, for the same employers, he laid cables in the deep waters of the Mediterranean and other seas. When the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company was formed in 1865, Canning was appointed its chief engineer. He had charge of the manufacture and laying of the transatlantic telegraph cables of 1865 and 1866, for which the company were the contractors. This work involved the fitting-out of the SS Great Eastern. On 2 August 1865 the cable broke in 2000 fathoms of water. After a second cable had been successfully laid by the Great Eastern (13‚Äì27 July 1866) Canning set to work to recover the broken cable, using special grappling machinery, which he devised for the purpose. After several failures the cable was eventually recovered on 2 September 1866. For these services, Canning was knighted in 1866, and Lu√≠s I of Portugal conferred on him the Order of St. Jago d'Espada. In 1869, he laid the French Atlantic cable between Brest and Duxbury, Massachusetts. Later life After retiring from the Telegraph Construction Company, Canning practiced as a consulting engineer in matters connected with telegraphy, and, among other work, superintended the laying of the Marseilles-Algiers and other cables for the India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company. He acted later as adviser to the West Indian, Panama and other telegraph companies. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (from 1 February 1876) and the Institution of Electrical Engineers. Canning died at 1 Inverness Gardens, Kensington, on 24 September 1908, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Family Canning married in 1859. His wife, Elizabeth Anne, died in 1909. She was the daughter of W. H. Gale of Grately, Hampshire. The couple had three sons and three daughters.

During the Bosnian War of the early 1990s, he was a government minister of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska and endorsed violence against Bosniak civilians. Kaƒçavenda also had close ties with many Serbian nationalists, including Ratko Mladiƒá, and is a nationalist himself. He has lived in Bijeljina since 1992.  Biography  = UDBA informant = Vasilije Kaƒçavenda over the years had a reputation of being either homosexual or bisexual. From 1960 onward, Kaƒçavenda worked closely with the communist Yugoslav secret service (UDBA). In a few sources it is suggested that these two factors were linked and resulted in forced collaboration with the secret service as they held sensitive material regarding his personal circumstances. The secret service viewed Kaƒçavenda as a \\"reliable\\" informant in 1970 when he was still a monk, yet by 1988 he was a nationalist and a priest was recruited to monitor him. Kaƒçavenda was an important figure within the nationalist network that could not be sidelined. Kaƒçavenda's lifestyle did not conform to the social agenda of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) and sources with knowledge on the situation viewed Kaƒçavenda in a critical way, but were fearful of possible violent reprisals. = Yugoslav Wars and aftermath = In the early 1990s, Bishops Kaƒçavenda and Amfilohije Radoviƒá deepened religious and ethnic divisions during the Yugoslav wars and alleged that a global conspiracy existed against the SOC. Kaƒçavenda was a government minister of the self declared Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska and strongly opposed abortion by advocating for state authorities and the SOC to oppose and ban the practise. At the time Kaƒçavenda was a SOC figure of the radical clerical faction that favoured combat during the Bosnian war. Amid the Bosnian war, the SOC ordered its bishoprics to remove valuable religious artifacts to safe locations and the collections based at the Episcopal Museum at Tuzla were relocated in 1992 by Kaƒçavenda to Bijeljina which became the new centre of his episcopal seat. The Bosnian Serb army during the Bosnian war gave the property of Muslims expelled by Arkan and his paramilitaries in Bijeljina to the SOC and Kaƒçavenda constructed a large building that became his residence and included a monastery and an extensive garden. Space was needed for the project during construction and Kaƒçavenda had ten deserted homes belonging to Muslims demolished and the area was close to the location of the Atik Mosque. Kaƒçavenda was a strong supporter of Arkan. Icons from the Church of the Cerement of the Virgin in Te≈°anj were unilaterally moved in 2001 to the episcopal seat at Bijeljina on orders from Kaƒçavenda without any agreement with Bosnian authorities or the Heritage Protection Authority. In 2001, Vasilije strongly opposed the rebuilding of the Atik Mosque in Bijeljina and he claimed in 2009 that the former Muslim structure was built atop a site that once contained an Orthodox church, yet evidence does not support that view. Years later after the war, a court ordered in 2005 that the legal owners of the expropriated land were to be compensated with 2 million Convertible Marks (or ‚Ç¨1 million) that included interest. = Bla≈æanoviƒá case = The SOC has never officially investigated the charges made about him that include an encounter with a stripper from Novi Sad and the case of a theology student Miliƒá Bla≈æanoviƒá, who refused Kaƒçavenda's advances and later was allegedly killed (1999) after he began to discuss the matter with others. An exception exists by Grigorije Duriƒá, a bishop reportedly under the protection of Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik. In the account given by the newspaper Borba, Grigorije, at an Assembly of Bishops (2008) confronted Kaƒçavenda about the Bla≈æanoviƒá case that resulted in a breakdown and his hospitalisation. Kaƒçavenda continued to be part of the Assembly of Bishops. = Candidate for Orthodox Serb Patriarch = In the late 2000s the Serbian newspaper Standard alleged that bishops Amfilohije Radoviƒá and Kaƒçavenda left a dying Patriarch Pavle in his role to extend time and increase their possibility of ascending to that office themselves. Kaƒçavenda was unofficially the leader of the strong and influential \\"Bosnian lobby\\" and a representative of nationalism. He, along with Amfilohije and Irinej Buloviƒá were the main candidates for SOC patriarch, even though Vasilije did not run for the position. Kaƒçavenda and Duriƒá, whose bishoprics are geographically nearby to each other represented different sides of discourse in the SOC. = 2012‚Äì13 sex abuse scandal = In November 2012, pornographic videos showing Kaƒçavenda in sexual acts with young men were first given to his church's synod. Kaƒçavenda submitted his resignation on 9 November, claiming \\"serious health problems\\". Not long after, he changed his mind and stayed on his post. When videos showing him performing oral sex on an young man were made public in April 2013, he said that he would fight the slanderous allegations against him, but announced his resignation as bishop on 22 April, which was accepted immediately. He was dismissed of all duties on 29 May 2013. Serbian police in Belgrade arrested two men on 11 April 2013 for attempting to sell video showing Bishop Kaƒçavenda in sex acts with four young men. The video length was about an hour and a half. One of the men who was arrested was a deacon in Kaƒçavenda's church and accused the bishop of pedophilia and stated that Kaƒçavenda attempted to kiss him on the neck and \\"private parts of the body\\", which was eventually the reason why he left the church. Kaƒçavenda has not been held to account by the SOC in any of its ecclesiastical courts. At the time of the scandal, fellow bishops were of the view that Kaƒçavenda should stay in a monastery or visit Russia until the situation became calm. = Health problems = Kaƒçavenda underwent surgery in Belgrade, a day after suffering a stroke in Bijeljina on 20 September 2013. He was again hospitalized less than two months later. Honors Kaƒçavenda received one of the highest decoration of the Republika Srpska entity, Order of the Republika Srpska, from its president, Milorad Dodik.

It records the growth and obstacles in the early church.Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an abbreviated Bible commentary. 23rd edition. Zondervan Publishing House. 1962. Text Acts 5:2‚Äì9; 6:1-6 on the verso side of Papyrus 8 (4th century). The original text was written in Koine Greek and is divided into 42 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Uncial 0189 (~AD 200) * Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Papyrus 8 (4th century; extant verses 2‚Äì9) * Papyrus 57 (4th century; extant verses 1‚Äì2, 8‚Äì10) * Codex Bezae (~400) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; extant verses 35‚Äì42) * Codex Laudianus (~550) Ananias and Sapphira (5:1‚Äì11) The narrative underlines the authority of Peter, who could see through the deception by Ananias and Sapphira (verses 3‚Äì5, 8‚Äì9) and highlights the spiritual authority of the \\"church\\" (Greek: ekklesia, first used in Acts in verse 11) in form of 'signs' of God (inducing 'great fear' in verses 5 and 11, as well as healing miracles in the next section). The sin of the couple was not simply the dishonesty on monetary value of the land sale, but rather the conspiracy to deceive the community (Greek: koinonia), which is a 'symptom of a more serious failure to be \\"of one mind\\" within the community' (cf. Ephesians 4:25; Colossians 3:9), that is, lying to the community equals to 'lying to God' (verse 4) and 'tempting the Holy Spirit' (verse 9; cf. Philippians 2:1-2 and 2 Corinthians 13:14). Signs and wonders (5:12‚Äì16) This section summarizes the 'ongoing healing ministry of the apostles' which increases the reputation of the believers of Christ among 'the people' (verse 13), because the bringing out of the sick for healing in public is a manifestation of 'belief (verse 15) which recalls the popularity of Jesus' healing ministry (cf. Luke 4:40-1, 6:18-19). The healing power coming out of Peter is so wonderful that it does not need even to touch him (verse 15: cf. Luke 7:1‚Äì10; 8:43). Arrest and escape (5:17‚Äì26) In the previous chapter, the apostles received a 'blanket prohibition on teaching in the name of Jesus', which their disdainfully rejected (), then before long, the authority arrested and placed the whole apostolic group in jail (verse 18). The apostles were soon miraculously released by an 'angel of the Lord', who instructed them to continue preaching in the temple (verses 19‚Äì21). The trial (5:27‚Äì32) This trial is 'essentially a reprise' of the previous one (Acts 4), with the charge of 'direct disobedience of an explicit instruction' (verse 28). Peter spoke of behalf of the apostles that they have to obey God, and not 'bound by any human court' (verse 29), followed by a summary of previous sermon points: Jesus has been killed by the authority who 'hanged him on a tree' (verse 30; referring to Deuteronomy 21:22‚Äì23 (cf. ; also in Paul's epistle, ), but raised and exalted by God to a position on his 'right hand', as a 'precondition for the outpouring of [spiritual] gifts' of 'repentance and forgiveness of sins now offered to Israel' (verses 31‚Äì32). =Verse 29= : But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: \\"We ought to obey God rather than men.\\" NKJV *\\"Ought to obey God rather than men\\": similar assertion as spoken by Peter and John in , but here has a new significance in relation to the command of the angel in Acts 5:20. The advice of Gamaliel (5:33‚Äì39) Rabban Gamaliel the Elder was one of the great Pharisaic teachers of the first century (flourished c. 25‚Äì50 CE) and is later said to have been the teacher of Paul (Acts 22:3). As a member of the Sanhedrin he began to question the wisdom of pursuing the case, which would be the main theme of the whole account: 'to recognize where God is at work'. The examples he cited ‚Äî Theudas and Judas of Galilee ‚Äî are both mentioned in the same order by a first-century historian, Josephus (Ant. 20.97‚Äì98, 102); but assigned to different time periods, with Judas linked to the time of the Roman census of Judea (cf. ) and Theudas dated by Josephus to procuratorship of Fadus (44‚Äì46 CE), which would happen after the account in this chapter.The date of the trial must be before the death of Herod in 44 CE (). Alexander 2007, p. 1036. The dating aspect is debated with arguments in favor of Luke or of Josephus, or the possibility of different Theudas and Judas. =Verse 34= :Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while. NKJV As Luke had mentioned (; ) that there was an influential party of Sadducees in the Sanhedrin, it is specifically noted here that Gamaliel was a Pharisee, who was well-respected to provide balancing opinions to the counsels of the Sadducean members, especially regarding the Resurrection (cf. ). Gamaliel is known in the Talmud as \\"Rabban Gamaliel the Elder\\" (to distinguish him from his grandson of the same name, \\"Gamaliel the Younger\\"), the grandson of Hillel the Elder, the head of the school of Hillel, at some time president of the Sanhedrin, one of the most famous Jewish doctors (the title Rabban is given to only six others), and one whose greatness would be as a shield to his students (Acts 22:3).Exell, Joseph S.; Spence-Jones, Henry Donald Maurice (Editors).

Summary and transition (5:40‚Äì42) Following Gamaliel's advice, the Sanhedrin treated the apostles with caution, but nonetheless sentenced them to flogging (verse 40). The punishment was received by apostles with 'joy' (verse 41) as they considered it 'worthy to be dishonored for the Name' as martyrs. The section concludes with an assurance that 'the gospel message is assiduously proclaimed, not only in the temple but from house to house'. =Verse 42= :And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.

He was praised as an artillery commander in combat and an organiser of military operations, as well as starting the first regimental school for soldiers' children, and serving as the architect of Quebec's Anglican cathedral.  Early life  Robe was born at Woolwich in 1765, the son of William Robe, Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery's invalid battalion, and proofmaster in the Royal Arsenal, and his wife, Mary Broom. He entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich on 20 October 1780 as an extra cadet, and was gazetted to a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 24 May 1781.  Career  Robe served from June 1782 to July 1784 at Jamaica, acting as adjutant and storekeeper. After two years at home he was in 1786 sent to Canada. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 22 November 1787, and returned to England in 1790. In April 1793 Robe went to Holland with the artillery under Major Wright, part of an advanced force of the Duke of York's army for the Flanders Campaign, the main body of artillery under Sir William Congreve embarking in May. Robe took part in the siege defence operations at Willemstad, with which the English share of the campaign commenced. He was appointed, in addition to his ordinary duties, acting adjutant and quartermaster, and at the instance of Congreve, he was made inspector of ammunition. Robe was at the Battle of Famars, the Siege of Valenciennes, the Battle of Caesar's Camp, the Siege of Dunkirk, the Siege of Landrecies, and the operations near Tournay, including at Lanoy and Roubaix. He took part in the retreat into Holland, and was particularly engaged at the bridge of Waerlem and at Nimeguen in October and November 1794, returning to England towards the end of November. Robe was promoted to be captain- lieutenant on 9 September 1794, and was appointed quartermaster in the Royal Artillery's 1st Battalion at Woolwich on 25 November, remaining there for nearly five years. In 1797 he originated the first regimental school for the children of soldiers; the Duchess of York subscribed liberally, and the school proved a success, so the Board of Ordnance undertook its direction. In 1799 Robe embarked for Holland with the Duke of York's army in the Helder Expedition. He was appointed brigade major of Royal Artillery under General Sir Anthony Farrington. He was present at the Battle of Bergen on 2 October 1799, on which date he was promoted to be captain. He took part in the capture of Alkmaar on 6 October, and returned to England with the army on 3 November, and on his return he was posted to the 9th Company of the 2nd Battalion. In the following year he was transferred to the command of the 9th Company, 4th Battalion in Canada, where he served on the staff until 1806. Having considerable knowledge of architecture and drawing, he was employed to design and to superintend the erection of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, which remains a permanent record of his talent. Robe was promoted to regimental major on 1 June 1806, when he returned to England, and regimental lieutenant- colonel on 13 January 1807. Robe accompanied the expedition to Copenhagen under Lord Cathcart in 1807. Major-General Thomas Blomefield commanded the artillery, and he favourably mentioned Robe for his command of the batteries of the left attack in his report on the bombardment. = Peninsular War = On 12 July 1808 Robe sailed for Portugal, in command of the artillery of Arthur Wellesley's expedition. He was present at the Battle of Roli√ßa on 17 August and the Battle of Vimeiro on 21 August, and was mentioned in despatches. At Vimeiro he used shrapnel shell for the first time, and was so pleased with its effect that he applied for large supplies of it. On the evacuation of Lisbon by the French, Robe took possession of the ordnance in the citadel. When Sir John Moore's army left for Spain, Robe remained in command of the artillery at Lisbon, under Sir Harry Burrard and John Craddock, until the arrival of Brigadier-General Howarth in April 1809. On Wellesley's return from England to take command of the British forces in the Peninsula in April 1809, Robe was in charge of the artillery reserves. He took part in the advance against Marshal Soult to the Tras os Montes, and the capture of Porto in May. He was in the advance into Spain against Joseph Buonaparte, the Battle of Talavera on 27 July 1809, and in the subsequent retreat over the Mesa d'Ibor to Truxillo, and thence to Badajos. In 1810 he was appointed to the command of the Royal Artillery driver corps, and he took part in the retreat to the Lines of Torres Vedras, including the Battle of Bussaco on 28 September. In 1811 Robe was engaged in all the active operations of the pursuit of Marshal Mass√©na to the region of Ciudad Rodrigo. In August he returned to England on account of his health, but rejoined the army before Badajos on 20 April 1812, the morning after the capture of the Picurina Fort. He opened the principal breaching batteries, and on the fall of Badajos he was particularly mentioned by Wellington in his despatch. Robe was present in the advance against Marshal Marmont, at the attack on the forts of Salamanca and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. He commanded the Royal Artillery at the entry of the army into Madrid, at the surrender of the Retiro, and at the unsuccessful Siege of Burgos, when for the third time he was mentioned in despatches. He was severely wounded in the retreat from Burgos, while defending the bridge at Cabe√ßon, near Valladolid. His wound necessitated his return to England; he was carried four hundred miles on men's shoulders to Lisbon. Robe was promoted to be brevet colonel on 4 June 1814, and to be regimental colonel on 16 May 1815. For his services he received on 13 September 1810 the Army Gold Medal for Roli√ßa and Vimeiro; on 13 September 1813 this was superseded by a cross bearing the names of Vimeiro, Talavera, Badajos, and Salamanca, and on 3 July 1815 an additional clasp for Bussaco was added. On 3 January 1815 Robe was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath and a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order that year. He was also permitted from that date to wear the Order of the Tower and Sword of Portugal, granted to him by the Prince Regent of Brazil on 12 October 1812.  Family  Robe married Sarah, daughter of Captain Thomas Watt of Quebec, about 1788 in Canada. Robe died at Shooters Hill, near Woolwich, on 5 November 1820, and was buried in the family vault in Plumstead churchyard. They had five sons and four daughters. Sarah died ten years after him, on 4 February 1831. All of his sons joined the British Army and all but one died while serving. Their eldest son, William Livingstone, was born in 1791, and served alongside his father in the Peninsular War before dying at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Their second son, Alexander Watt (1793‚Äì1849), was a lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Engineers, and their third son, Thomas Congreve (1799‚Äì1853) a lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Artillery. Their fourth son, Frederick Holt (1801‚Äì1871), was major-general and colonel of the 95th Regiment of Foot, and the Governor of South Australia. The fifth son, George Mountain Sewell (1802‚Äì1825), was a lieutenant in the 26th Bengal Native Infantry, served as adjutant in the First Burmese War, and died on passage to Chittagong. Robe's daughters were unmarried. The youngest, Vimiera, died in December 1893 at Woolwich. She presented to the Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich all the medals, orders, and decorations of her father and eldest brother, together with miniature portraits of each of them.

Working versions of the watch were available in 1975 but Omega did not release the watch until 1976.Richon, Marco (2007). A Journey Through Time. Omega Ltd. P.375. Production watch Omega calibre 1611 Chrono-Quartz case back with olympic logo The Omega Chrono-Quartz is rare amongst modern wristwatches as the calibre 1611 was had a module exclusive to itself; only 15,000 units were made.Richon, Marco (2007). A Journey Through Time. Omega Ltd. P.775. The production version of the watch was introduced at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games and at the same time Omega sponsored the event. The main Olympic scoreboard bore remarkable similarities to the Chrono-Quartz wrist watch. The design of the watch was very distinctive - primarily it was large (51mm wide including the pushers), even in comparison to other watches of its time. The case of the watch was made from stainless steel and with an integral solid link stainless steel bracelet. The main reason for the big dimensions was the size of the movement, which had to accommodate the analogue module (on the right) and the digital chronograph module (on the left). The case back bore the Omega Seamaster hippocampus as well as the Olympic crest in recognition of the event at which it was introduced. The chronograph module was controlled by three round pushers on the left side of the case and the analogue time and date were adjusted by a crown which could be pulled out to adjust the hour and date and a button within the crown which when pressed advanced the minutes. When new in 1976, the watch cost ¬£375 ; by contrast Omega's established Chronograph the Speedmaster professional 145.022 cost ¬£175. This made the Chrono-Quartz a very expensive option in comparison to the other chronographs in Omega's range. This was one of Omega's range of one-year-only production chronographs, which included the famous Omega Speedmaster 125 and the Omega Bullhead of 1969. Summary Although revolutionary in design and function the reign of the Chrono-Quartz as Omega's flagship chronograph was short lived. In 1977 Omega released the calibre 1620, which was a full digital LCD chronograph in numerous executions of Constellation and Speedmaster Professional. The full LCD display of the omega Chronograph rendered the Chrono-Quartz obsolete, at the same time changes in design and fashion moved towards slimmer and smaller watches, by comparison the 1620 range of watches was at least 1/3rd smaller than the bulky Chrono-Quartz.Lucien F. Trueb, G√ºnther Ramm & Peter Wenzig (2013) Electrifying the Wristwatch P.175 The Chrono-Quartz remained in Omega's line up for a further two years but by 1979, it had been completely phased out. Despite its relatively short production span and limited application the Chrono-Quartz represents one of Omega's most distinctive designs of the 1970s and was a world first in blending analogue and digital technology, which was also later used by Heuer amongst others and is still used by modern wristwatch manufacturers.

In 2009 it was chosen along with the Council of Wise Men of the plain of Murcia as intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO. Proceedings of the Tribunal The Tribunal is a customary court. It consists of one representative, called a trustee, from each of the Irrigation Communities‚Äînine in total‚Äîand one among them is elected president for a period of two years. Every Thursday the Tribunal meets in public and an administrative session at the Casa Vestidor at the Pla√ßa de la Mare de D√©u of Valencia to discuss various issues, mainly the distribution of water. On public holidays that fall on a Thursday, the Water Court meets on the preceding Wednesday http://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-visit-valencia/monuments/list-of- monuments/monument/7834. That is when the bailiff, with the permission of the president, calls for cases from each of the canals in turn, with the traditional phrase \\"denunciants de la s√®quia de...!\\" (\\"claimants from the irrigation canal of...!\\"). The trial takes place quickly and is completely in Valencian. Each complainant puts his case before the Tribunal, and then the accused defends himself and answers questions. It is then when the Tribunal, with the exception of the trustee of the canal in question (to ensure fairness) decides the guilt of the defendant, and if so found, it is the trustee of the canal who imposes the penalty for the offender, according to the Bylaws of the Irrigation Communities (). The court is purely oral‚Äîthere is nothing done in writing and no records are kept.http://www.valenciavalencia.com/sights-guide/sights-listings/tribunal- aguas-water-court.htm History Tribunal de las Aguas by Bernardo Ferr√°ndiz, 1865 The Tribunal's origin is not fully known, although it is likely to have evolved from previous Andalusian traditions. Some historians such as Jos√© Vicente G√≥mez Bayarri placed its origins in Roman times. The most widespread theory, but without any historical basis, is owed to Francisco Javier Borrull. His hypothesis is that there was already a precedent in Roman times, but its foundation as it operates today occurred during the reigns of the Caliphs Abd- ar-Rahman III and Al-Hakam II, specifically in 960. Borrull's reason was that during the reign of these two Caliphs was an era of complete peace on the Iberian peninsula, and therefore it must have been founded then. In fact, the millennial anniversary of the founding of the Water Tribunal took place in 1960, led by Vicente Giner Boira, legal adviser to the Tribunal at the time, and leading proponent of this theory in the twentieth century.

There is no set main character. Instead, the story switches perspectives between each teams and different characters. Every member of a team has a name containing a kigo, a poetic seasonal word, related to the team name ‚Äî for example, all of the members of the Spring team have names traditionally associated with spring. Each team consists of seven members plus a guide trained in wilderness survival. Teams There are currently five teams living in the world of 7 Seeds. Summer Team B, Spring Team, Winter Team, and Fall Team were placed in cryogenics around the same time. Summer Team A was placed 17 years before them, while Mozu was frozen a few years after Team A. Every team resurfaced at different times. The five teams are listed in order of appearance in the series, which is different from the order in which they were revived from cryonic preservation in the series' chronology. =Summer Team B= Summer Team B is created after the other four Japanese teams as a backup and consists of people who are healthy but rebellious or otherwise not well-adjusted to society.

He is very skilled at survival and stands out for having a name element, , that is a kigo of autumn instead of summer. In volume 6, when he meets Hana of Spring team while she is in despair, he offers to kill her. In volume 12, he tells Botan he is the nephew of the Prime Minister and a leader of the Seven Seeds project. A flashback reveals that he is responsible for the creation of the Seven Seeds program along with the selection of the members of Summer team A. ; : :The guide for Summer team B. She used to be a policewoman and therefore skilled in self- defense. Very outspoken and straightforward in her communication. =Spring Team= The Spring Team emerges from cryonic preservation a few months after Summer Team B near an island off the coast of the Kant≈ç region of central Honshu, and travel to Ogino Fuji in Kanagawa Prefecture, where they find a note from Natsu of Summer Team B.

He dies saving the others by setting himself on fire after the giant praying mantis eggs that were laid inside his body hatched. =Winter Team= The Winter Team emerges from cryonic preservation in the Pacific Ocean off the southern coast of Hokkaid≈ç about fifteen years before the start of the series. Three members die during the thawing process; on the way to the cache at Mt. Meakandake, they are attacked by a saber toothed tiger, killing their guide and Mutsuki. The remaining three, Mitsuru, Fubuki, and Takahiro, form a close relationship as they fight for survival. ; : :The main character of the chapters about Winter Team. Takahiro is a talented and famous high-school baseball player, described as the best pitcher to appear in 50 years, and plays in the K≈çshien.

After Fubuki and Mitsuru die, Takahiro survives on his own with two wolves named after them, which he raises from puppies, until he meets Arashi, Natsu and Semimaru of Summer Team B in the ruins of Tokyo. Later, he meets Hana of Spring Team, who invites him to join them. ; : :Another talented and well-known high-school baseball player who, like Takahiro, plays at K≈çshien.

In the data books, he is seen picking apples from a tree and collecting them in a basket. ; :The guide for the Winter Team. He is killed by a sabertoothed tiger soon after being revived. =Fall Team= The Fall Team emerges from cryonic preservation about three years before the start of the series in the Sea of Japan off the coast of the Kansai region of western Honshu, and travel to Kobe Fuji in Hyogo Prefecture. They are led by Akio and Ran, who overthrew the Team guide Ryoya and keep the rest of the members enslaved with tasks such as raising corn, tending livestock and weaving fabric. Months after they meet Arashi, Natsu, and Semimaru from Summer Team B, the sky starts to rain ashes, which makes their hideout, field and everything they have built useless and unlivable. The Fall Team sets out to visit other Fuji and to find a safe place to live in. ; : :The leader of Fall Team, once a young but successful Internet businessman who studied in America and became fluent in English and Spanish. He and Ran dominate the rest of Fall Team, forcing them to work to quotas. ; : :An aggressive and selfish woman who used to work as an architect.

He is killed by Ango of Summer Team A in chapter 63, when he jumps to protect Ran. =Summer Team A= The members of Summer Team A were specially chosen for the Seven Seeds Project by the Japanese government. This project genetically engineered and conceived about 100 babies, born from carefully selected egg cells and sperms. Because of this, none of the members of Summer Team A have a family name. These babies are raised on an island and taught wilderness survival until they reach the age of 17. At that time, a last test is carried out to select the seven that are put in cryonic preservation. \\"Failures\\" or dropouts from this project are said to have left the island to join the rest of society, but it is revealed that they are actually killed and disposed of. Each child is instructed in seven classes of technologies: water, fire, wind, earth, plant, animal, and medical, and at age 13, they choose two classes to specialize in. In the end, one survivor is selected to represent each class. They emerge from cryonic preservation in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern Ky≈´sh≈´, a little later than Spring Team. ; : :A specialist in fire and water classes and the main character of the chapters about Summer Team A. He is the top student of the project and a rival of Ryou's. He and Ryou reluctantly respect each other. Ango was attracted to Ayu previously. He is close friends with Koruri, Mayu, Nobara, and Shigeru. Ango unconsciously sees Natsu as Shigeru because of their similar timid personalities and hard-working nature. He has now learned to be a bit more open, possibly due to the influence of Team Summer B. ; : :A specialist in wind and medical classes. She seems interested in Haru and enjoys listening to his music. She has naturally curly hair and is a good hang-glider. ; : :A specialist in fire and water classes. Ryou is a top student and Ango's rival. He is depicted as rebellious with a cold demeanor, capable of evaluating situations dispassionately, but he shows glimpses of compassion at times. Though he may not seem like it on the surface, Ryou cares a lot about Ango, and seems to have developed a funny bond with Semimaru, where the latter refers to him as \\"Sensei\\" due to his extensive knowledge and survival skills. Ryou means cool. ; : :Also known as Madonna for her beauty, Ayu is the best specialist in the plant class and also specializes in earth classes. She is sometimes bullied by other girls because they are jealous of her appearance and the attention she attracts from boys. She looks down on other human beings, frequently referring to them as idiots and filthy creatures. She now owns a small hyper black dog named \\"Kuroda\\" given by Aramaki, and is shown to be quite fond of him. Her interactions with Aramaki seem to have positive effects on her, as she is shown trying to understand Aramaki's views, and has no doubt developed an admiration for Aramaki. Ayu means sweetfish. ; : :A specialist in animal and plant classes. Gengorou is depicted as a kind and mature person. He and Ango respect each other as peers. ; : :A specialist in animal and medical classes. Ban is depicted as slow and socially awkward, but he is quick on his feet when treating an injured person. ; : :A specialist in earth and water classes, Nijiko is depicted as always being calm and collected.

He is an overpowering jerk and has no qualms about hitting his students. After their revival in chapter 50, he becomes the target of revenge by Summer Team A and is killed by all members aside from Ban who does not participate but does not attempt to stop his Team either. The Ryugu Shelter The posthumous characters that get a main focus in the Ash arc. Their story is told primarily from the point of view of Mark Ibaraki, a comedian who recollects his days at the shelter on a diary that Hana and the others find in the underground shelter. The shelter's events lasted a few years after the strike of the meteor, but it halted due to the spread of the Acari X virus. ; : :The main character of the Ash arc, who is dead by the time is story is recounted.

Animals As she did in her other previous works already, Yumi Tamura placed strong emphasis on the deep connection of the protagonists with the nature surrounding them by having them interact with various animals who often play an important role in supporting the characters. =Aramaki's pack= Fubuki and Mitsuru-san paired up with others dogs and gave birth to many puppies. The whole dog population consists of almost hundred dogs by now. They're scattered in several smaller packs all over Honshu. Their appearances vary a lot. Still deeply attached to Aramaki although they don't live with him all the time anymore, they come when he calls for them and do various tasks for him like hunting, guarding duty, trailing tracks or searching for water and food sources. Their help was a great support for Aramaki and enabled him to survive in this dangerous new world all alone for 15 years. Adult dogs ; Fubuki A male wolf-like dog companion of Aramaki‚Äôs since he was a puppy, and named after the late Fubuki of Team Winter. He's the Son of the nameless dog from Hokkaido who led Aramaki to safety after his other comrades perished. Fubuki was the Alpha Male of Aramaki‚Äôs pack consisting of almost a hundred other adults and puppies, scattered in several smaller packs all over Honshu. Fubuki, together with the rest of the adult dogs of Aramaki‚Äôs pack, had been ‚Äúinfected‚Äù by the spores of mushroom in Chapater 119, resulting in impending death due to said mushroom growing on their body. Together with the rest of the adult dogs of the pack, they intentionally set themselves ablaze and made a perimeter around the forest overrun with said mushroom to prevent any infected animals from leaving the burning forest, and prevent the humans from entering said forest. ; Mitsuru-san A female dog named after the late Mitsuru of Team Winter. She has accompanied Aramaki ever since she was a puppy. She's the daughter of the nameless dog from Hokkaido who led Aramaki to safety after his other comrades perished. Mitsuru-san also seems to be the female alpha dog of Aramaki's entire pack consisting of almost hundred dogs by now, scattered in several smaller packs all over Honshu. She perished with the rest of the adult dogs of the pack in the blaze which engulfs the forest in Chapter 119. ; Derek An adult male dog from Aramaki's pack. Fubuki and Mitsuru-san paired with other dogs (as shown in a flash back), and each giving birth to a lot of puppies. They're almost a hundred dogs by now, scattered in several smaller packs all over Honshu. Derek leads the search team for Hana. He looks very wolf-alike. His special feature are two white circles around the eyes. He perished in the blaze that engulfs the forest in Chapter 119. Juvenile dogs ; Kuroda Since he's often being bullied by the other dogs, Ayu adopts him as her own dog as per Aramaki's suggestion. Kuroda loves to tease his mistress and licks her all over whenever he gets the opportunity. His fur is completely black; he looks like a mixture between Tibetan Terrier and Shih-poo. ; Ball He's hungry all the time and often trails off. But it isn't bad all the time because this way he was able to find Momota and deliver his call for help to Hana's team. Ball resembles a Laekenois, with scrubby light fur and black ears. He's very trusting even to strangers. Puppies ; Diamond (Dai) A puppy from the latest litter of Fubuki and Mitsuru-san. The brother of Battery. Very curious and reckless. Looks like a Tibetan Terrier, dark coat, fair muzzle and legs. When he and his brother went astray on an adventure tour, he finds Hana and warns her of a reptile closing in on her. ; Battery (Batsu) A puppy from the latest litter of Fubuki and Mitsuru-san. The brother of Diamond. Very curious and reckless. Looks like a Maltese, with fair coat, curled tail and snapped off ears. When he and his brother went astray on an adventure tour, he is being chased by a large reptile, but Hana rescues him just in time. =Summer B's animals= ; Macadamia Nuts (Nuts) A tabby cat who was Natsu's pet in the past, before she was sent to the future. She deeply misses him. ; Peanuts A baby flesh eating rabbit. Natsu wanted to keep it as her pet and Arashi suggested its name. However, it was killed by Mozu in order to prevent it from attracting the rest of its pack. ; Carol A llama-alike animal with a very keen sense for edible and dangerous food. She was given as a present from Izayoi to Team Summer B as they parted from Team Autumn. Ever since then, her delicious milk and her sharp instincts have been a great help to Team Summer B. She's also strong and can carry heavy luggage, even persons. Not even travelling on a ship does pose a problem to her. ; Moron Birds Arashi, Semimaru and Natsu at some point of the story discovered a flightless kind of birds and decided to take in some of them as a supply of eggs and bird meat. Because they're so trusting to humans, the cynical Semimaru decides to call them Moron Birds. ; Ice Turtles During their adventure in the ghost ship Fuji, Arashi picked up a pair of turtles which had been preserved in a hibernation state. Which kind of turtles they are, whether they're actually alive (and whether they're really a male and a female) is still unknown, though. =Team Spring's animals= ; Cheeky Foal A still nameless, cheeky young foal which got attached to Hana and sticks close to her after its mother's death. White, curly fur, very beautiful and cute, but an extremely stubborn child, too. ; Boar Family A little family of boars, consisting of the mother and four baby boars. They befriend Hana and protect her as she just woke up from her fall into the whirlpool. But they have to painfully separate again because Chisa unknowingly killed and cooked one of the young boars, resulting in Hana accidentally eating her little friend. =Team Autumn's animals= ; Guri and Gura Two llama-alike animals with a very keen sense for edible and dangerous food. They live with Team Autumn. The llamas' delicious milk and their sharp instincts have been a great help to Team Autumn. They are also strong and can carry and pull heavy luggage, even persons. =Gengorou's animals= Gengorou took care of many different animal species since he was part of the animal class during Summer A's time of education. He loved them deeply and built up a strong relationship especially to Tango and Aoba, but during Summer A's test he had to kill most of them with his own hands because they became dangerous to his comrades. It broke his heart. ; Aoba A tame large male brown bear which was reared by Gengorou ever since he was a cub. He was very trusting towards humans and got quite attached to Gengorou. But during Team Summer A's test he was probably deliberately infected with rabies and tossed out in the middle of the mountains. Pained and puzzled, he attacked Koruri's team and took away one of Ukai's eyes. Ukai shot him several times in return and Aoba died slowly, suffering great pains. ; Tango A tame large male tiger which was reared by Gengorou ever since he was a cub. He was very trusting towards humans and got quite attached to Gengorou. But during Team Summer A's test he was probably deliberately infected with rabies and tossed out in the middle of the mountains. Pained and puzzled, he attacked and killed several Summer A candidates. Gengorou took responsibility and strangled him to death. =Other animals= ; Saber-toothed tiger A large saber-toothed tiger alike cat who killed several members of Team Winter. But after being killed by Aramaki, it turned out that the tiger also was just a mother who did her best to feed her cub. The cub ran away from Aramaki and was probably killed in the flame of the bushfire. ; Ten-ten A cute little dog owned by Maria. She brought it along with her into Ryugu Shelter, but Takashi took it away and quarantined it because he thought Ten-ten might be the \\"hidden carrier\\" of Acari X - a seemingly healthy parasite host showing no symptoms of illness, but infecting those around him. The dog was never seen again; he probably got disposed of. This entire thing caused Maria great grief. Ten-ten's fur was completely black; his appearance resembled a Shih-poo.

The candidates to perform the care functions in the community are marked out as 'full of the Spirit' (verses 3, 5), and 'the transmission of authority from the apostles' is 'very deliberately assured through prayer and the laying on of hands' (verse 6). =Verse 5= : And the saying pleased the whole multitude.

Mich! An! (Call! Me!) is a German novel published in 2000, Else Buschheuers first. Widely described as soft porn, it was a best-seller, and although disliked by most reviewers when it first appeared, has since been much discussed by critics, some of whom argue that its seriousness was underrated. Background Buschheuer is from East Germany and after German reunification wrote a column for a magazine for East Germans, Super-Ossi, under the name die rasende Else (raging Else), then became a TV editor and reporter. When she wrote the book she had been a weather reporter for three years, an unusually fast and successful adjustment to capitalism.Evelyn Roll, \\"Ich schreibe, also bin ich\\", S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, July 28, 2001 , cited in Kristie A.

Foell, Berlin: The Symphony Continues. Orchestrating Architectural, Social, and Artistic Change in Germany's New Capital, Berlin/New York: De Gruyter, 2004, , pp. 279-99, p. 281. The novel reads as if written by a West German, a critic wrote in Die Welt.Mathias Nolte, \\" Die Einheit ist vollbracht Weil Wessis wie Ossis schreiben und vice versa. Zum Beweis: die Romane von Else Buschheuer und Doja Hacker\\", Die Welt, June 14, 2000 Plot Ruf! Mich! An! is set in Berlin at the end of the 1990s. The protagonist, Paprika, is a self-described sociophobe who lives in an \\"anonymous\\" apartment building in Daimler City on Potsdamer Platz that is \\"wall-to-wall autistics\\", celebrates her birthday with the one person with whom she is close--herself--and operates a successful advertising agency almost entirely by means of SMS exchanges with her assistant. She is characterized by \\"exaggerated techno-consumerism\\":Foell, p. 284. she constantly channel surfs, conducts business in the bathtub and on the toilet using a headset, orders in almost all her food, buys ten jars of asparagus just because she finds a parking spot in front of the grocery store, then gives them to a panhandler, fantasizes about running barefoot through chocolate truffles, orders them delivered, then says she does not recall ordering them because she has \\"short-term memory loss due to excessive cellphone use\\". She shoots her expensive widescreen TV through the screen in a fit of pique and complains that \\"the world is unfair\\" because her TV is wrecked but Roger Willemsen is still alive. One of the two men with whom she associates, Dietrich, a bartender whose prime motive appears to be finding \\"something fuckable\\", describes her as \\"a consumer cripple with an amputated soul\\", which she admits to with pride. The other, Robert, is a concertmaster who can only get excited at the thought of long-dead film divas of yesteryear. Paprika's most characteristic sexual activity is masturbating to the late program on Arte; the first edition of the novel reputedly fell open at this scene.Foell, p. 283, note 18. However, one day when she calls information, the operator gives her his own phone number. She enters an anonymous sado- masochistic sexual liaison with him recalling that in Laclos' Les Liaisons dangereuses: he calls himself Valmont. He summons her by SMS and abuses her, until suddenly he does not, and she falls apart from thwarted addiction, throwing her cellphone into the toilet, ripping the phone cord out of the wall, and drinking Laphroaig from the bottle. Instead of Valmont, an East German bumpkin, Maik, appears on her doorstep, so she shoots him and dumps his body in front of his own door for his wife, Mandy.

Mich! An!, New York: self-published on demand, 2002, , p. 7 .

Nonetheless it became a bestseller, and an audio book appeared the following year.Ren√© Wagner, \\"H√∂rbuch-Rezension: Ruf! Mich!

In 2004, Kristie Foell judged it an up-to-date and recognizable critique of \\"degradation through Westernization\\".Foell, p. 285. In 2007, it was the subject of a doctoral dissertation by Oliver Benjamin Ham in which he argued that it presents the \\"gendered body\\" of the protagonist as \\"the main mediator and battle field of the divisions and tensions in Berlin between East and West Germans\\".Oliver Benjamin Ham, \\"Berlin's Cultural East and West Division: Masochism and the Female Body\\", PhD dissertation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2007, . In 2010, Tabea D√∂rfelt- Mathey saw it as an incisive portrait of the 1990s, built up out of details and lists in a manner reminiscent of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho, with a protagonist who problematizes the female role: she acts like a man until in playing the part of Eug√©nie to \\"Valmont\\", she becomes weak.

Maynard is the co- founder of LifeLock and the founder of Internet America, as well as of several smaller companies that did not succeed. Maynard was not diagnosed with Bipolar disorder until 2001, by which time he had already been the founder of Internet America, which went public in 1998. He then went on to co-found Lifelock with Todd Davis in 2005, resigning amid controversy from his position at LifeLock in 2007 due to problems related to his condition. He relocated to Hawaii in 2008 and started a water sports company, Kandoo. Now the CEO of SurchX, a startup in the fintech business, Maynard regularly speaks and writes about what it is like to live with bipolar disorder. Early life Maynard was born in 1962 in Phoenix, Arizona, enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 1981 and served until 1985. He then took a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the US Army Reserve. He served as an officer in the Army‚Äôs 12th Special Forces Group for nine years. He attended Northern Arizona University from 1985 until 1987 where he graduated in five semesters with honors that included the Wall Street Journal Award, Distinguished Military Scholar, induction into Beta Gamma Sigma and nomination for the Truman Scholarship for excellence in leadership and academics. Career In the late 1990s Maynard had success as the founder of Internet America. The company was established in early 1995,\\"Company Information.\\" Internet America. Retrieved on September 25, 2009. as an Internet Service Provider (ISP) from his home. In March, 1997, after the company defaulted on a promissory note made to a shareholder, Maynard was replaced as CEO by Michael Maples. Within 4 years the company had grown to over 145,000 subscribers.\\"Article: Internet America Finalizes Acquisition of PDQ.Net; Over 145,000 Subscribers for Combined Entity.\\" PR Newswire. November 23, 1999. Retrieved on September 25, 2009. Shortly after departing Internet America, Maynard founded Dotsafe. It became a provider of Internet filtering for education and uncovered multiple online predators. The company eventually folded in 2001 after the dot com bubble burst. Maynard became ill with what was later diagnosed as bipolar disorder. According to news reports in the Phoenix New Times, lawsuits from a \\"slew of creditors\\" followed both Dotsafe and Maynard. Following his illness, Maynard became the co-founder of LifeLock in 2005, along with Todd Davis. LifeLock specialized in identity theft protection. The system created by Maynard and Davis was intended to detect fraudulent actions for a variety of financial services. Over the next couple of years, the company expanded quickly and was recognized by many as an upcoming company. Because of earlier adverse publicity, Maynard elected to resign from his position at LifeLock. Following his resignation, it was reported that Electronic Convulsive Therapy (ECT) had affected his memory of the incident in his past that led to his resignation and his claim that he had no memory of the incident. He moved with his family to Oahu, Hawaii, where he started a water sports business called Kandoo. The company folded a number of months later following financial problems, leaving many employees without pay checks. Maynard more recently registered the website iValidate.me, which he thought might become an online consumer-direct credit bureau when fully launched, according to Maynard's LinkedIn profile. Instead, he gathered a team of friends and former employees around him and founded SurchX back in Phoenix. SurchX is an enterprise SaaS company that levels the playing field for merchants against bigger players by allowing them to recover their credit card processing fees through surcharging, which is now legal in 44 states. Personal life In the late 1990s while the CEO of Dotsafe, Maynard began to suffer from an as yet undiagnosed illness that affected his work. Maynard has said on his website that the condition affected all aspects of his life and even led him to a divorce. After Dotsafe folded during the dotcom bust in 2001, Maynard sought further medical advice on his condition and was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Maynard has suffered with the condition since then and it was a major factor in him leaving LifeLock. While suffering with the condition he underwent Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT). This therapy was claimed by Maynard to be the main reason for many of his confusing statements about his past, as the treatment affected his memory. Maynard is now a speaker and writer about Bipolar disorder.

These interpretations have evolved with popular feminist ideologies, including those of the first-wave, second-wave feminism, and socialist feminist movements.  Historical background to feminist interpretations  Historical writings from the Early Modern period regarding the witch trials establish a basis for the feminist interpretation of the trials. These texts exemplify the witch stereotype, more specifically the female nature of it, that was integrated into society at the time. = The Malleus Maleficarum = The Malleus Maleficarum is one of the most well-known treatise on witchcraft, written by the Catholic clergyman, Heinrich Kramer, in 1486. The essay is divided into three different parts, each of which meant to convey different information. The first asserts how to preach about witchcraft and how to frame witchcraft in a religious way. The second section includes details about witches specifically, particularly characteristics common in witches, how witchcraft is conducted, as well as who is susceptible to possession. Finally, the text describes how the prosecution of witches should occur. Each part is organized by asking questions and then providing an answer. Today, the Malleus Maleficarum is widely referred to as evidence of the misogynistic nature of witch trials. The Malleus Maleficarum clearly and repeatedly asserts that women are more likely to participate in witchcraft or ‚Äúsorcery‚Äù due to qualities that all and only women have. One such passage from the second section, which focuses on describing witches in great detail, offers insight into how the author viewed women: :‚ÄúThere are others who give different reasons for why women are found to be superstitious in larger numbers than men, and they say that there are three reasons. The first is that they are prone to believing and because the demon basically seeks to corrupt the Faith, he assails them in particular. Hence Ecclesiasticus 19[4]: ‚ÄòHe who quickly believes is fickle in heart and will be made small.‚Äô The second reason in that on account of the tendency of their temperament towards flux they are by nature more easily impressed upon to receive revelations through the impression of the disembodied spirits, and when they use this temperament well, they are very good, but when they use it badly, they are worse. For this reason, is that they have loose tongues and can hardly conceal from their female companions the things that they know through evil art, and since they lack physical strength, they readily seek to avenge themselves through acts of sorcery... Since they are prone to flux, they can more quickly offer children to the demons, as in fact they do.‚Äù This passage from the Malleus Maleficarum declares that women are ultimately more susceptible to possession from demons, as well as more prone to lash out using witchcraft just on the basis of assumed female characteristics, such as ‚Äúloose tongues‚Äù and ‚Äúlack physical strength‚Äù. Because this treatise played such a large role in efforts against witchcraft in the early modern time period, it may be assumed that these attitudes about women were widespread and believed by many people in Europe. Additionally, this writing was published during a time of widespread religious influence, therefore as a religious piece of writing, it might have been accepted more readily. = Witches and early modern stereotypes of women = The stereotype of witches that existed during the early modern period was derived from historical conceptions of demonism that existed even before the witch trials began. Scholars have cited the belief in female demons in particular as relating directly to the later stereotype of heightened female magic. The first Germanic law codes also referred to the existence of cannibal women who had strikingly similar characteristics as early modern witches. Both were more likely to be female, elderly, poor, isolated from society, or sexually deviant, all of which are characteristics that were outside of the gendered expectations. These particular characteristics as being witch-like can be seen in documentation of trials or records of events of supposed witchcraft. One such record, titled, ‚ÄúThe most wonderfull and true storie, of a certaine witch named Alse Gooderige of Stapen hill‚Äù from 1597 exemplifies how women were more likely to be accused of witchcraft based on possessing these characteristics. The document depicts an interaction between Gooderige and a young boy, in which Gooderige is accused of bewitching him. The document includes descriptions of Gooderige as an accused witch, describing her as an elderly widow and having warts on her face. This description reflects the phenomenon that women were more likely to be accused of witchcraft if they deviated from the societal acceptance of being young, beautiful, and involved in society life. First and second wave One of the earliest individuals to present a feminist interpretation of the witch trials was the American Matilda Joslyn Gage, a writer who was deeply involved in the first-wave feminist movement for women's suffrage. In 1893, she published the book Woman, Church and State, in which Gage argued that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess. However, she repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt. In 1973, two American second-wave feminists, Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, published an extended pamphlet in which they asserted that the women persecuted had been the traditional healers and midwives of the community who were being deliberately eliminated by the male medical establishment. This theory is questionable, as the majority of those persecuted were neither healers nor midwives. Although they had initially self-published the work, they received such a positive response that the Feminist Press took over publication, and the work then began worldwide distribution, being translated into French, Spanish, German, Hebrew, Danish and Japanese. An updated edition of Ehrenreich and English's publication was re-printed in 2010. Other feminist historians have rejected this interpretation of events. Historian Diane Purkiss described it as \\"not politically helpful\\" because it constantly portrays women as \\"helpless victims of patriarchy\\" and thus does not aid them in contemporary feminist struggles.  Other interpretations  Modern scholar Edward Bever theorizes that the high rate of female accusers and accused could have derived from the widespread misogyny of the time. He emphasizes the fact that participation in patriarchal society is not exclusive to men and patriarchal and misogynistic values can permeate a whole society, including women. Europe in the early modern period had rigid gender expectations and those who did not align with those expectations could suffer consequences. For example, it has been suggested that there is a possibility that women who were accused of witch craft were those who stepped outside of the gender roles assigned to them in their society, such as women who were overtly sexual. These societal expectations of women as well as the stereotype of witches that existed at the time may have contributed to the high number of women accused. Even women who lived within the permitted gender roles of the time might have lived in fear of being accused, prompting them to make false accusations before someone could accuse them. These attitudes about gender may be an explanation for why some areas experienced higher numbers of males accused, such as at the margins of Europe, in Iceland, Finland, Estonia, and Russia.If these same beliefs about gender did not permeate these areas, then it makes sense that there would be less of a connection between gender and the accusations of witchcraft.  Silvia Federici  Silvia Federici offers radical feminist insight into the witch hunt process in her book Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation, published in 2004. Her book investigates the transition phase to capitalism, and brings evidence that the process happened in parallel with the Inclosure Acts which deprived women of economic autonomy by retrieving access to commons lands in the transition to a capitalist economy. Federici also comments on the developing sexual division of labor at the time, due to rising capitalism, and how this impacted stress for women. =Caliban and The Witch= In her book Caliban and the Witch (2004), Silvia Federici argues that the witch-hunts were historical events through which occurred the transformation of women's bodies into ‚Äúwork machines‚Äù for the reproduction of the workforce, a necessary precondition of a shift from the subsistence to the monetary economy. She remarks that the period the witch- hunts happened in the world history took place at the same time with the conquest of America, beginning of the History of slavery, and expropriation of the peasantry; which all indicate the rise of capitalism. In her view, the witch-hunt was the forgotten piece of the historical puzzle of the emergence of capitalism. Theoretical background As opposed to Marx's claim, according to Federici, the historical shift from a subsistence economy (production-for-use) to a capitalism (production-for-profit) has not caused a liberation of the working class from scarcity and necessity, but the other way around, the economy has become subject to wage labor exploitation, unpaid work of women, and degradation of environmental nature. Because the burden of the structural change in economic relations and the production with enclosures in the first phase of capitalist development had stood mostly by women, they were the ones who tried to save their lands, social position, and subsistence- oriented agriculture practices. However, governments in Europe, by passing a law that introduced a new crime, i.e. the accusation of witchcraft ‚Äîa crimen exceptum equal to high treason‚Äî they attempted to silence the resistance of women and any other alternative solutions to feudalism other than capitalism. Besides, it allowed primitive accumulation by taking the capacities available for social production as granted, and treated them as free and infinitely available gifts, in the same way how the capitalist system would treat nature. Federici has expanded the Marxist analysis of the birth of capitalism by including the change in the social position of women and the production of labor-power. The stress is given to the fact that the division of labor is highly gendered. The new sexual division of labor has developed itself with subjugating women's labor, and women's reproductive function to produce labor- force; the undervaluation and subordination of women by excluding them from waged work; and in association with the mechanization of workforce, women's body has also been started to perceived as machines to produce new workers. Federici and many scholars argue that the sexual division of labor with the control of women's body is the precondition to produce the surplus value. The social reproductive theory mainly argues that capitalism exploits women's labor outside the workplace through their invisible, flexible, and unpaid labor. Besides the structural changes in the spheres of reproduction and in the terrain of the relation between men and women, Federici argues that the shift coming with all the means and tools of capital accumulation was an attract to communal mutual aid. Being midwives, their capabilities of healing practices to cure people with herbs and their knowledge of the properties of plants and roots had given them a position in society. With infra-politics of capitalism, the attack on the healer resulted in that the communal production and survival skills were taken away from the society, which had changed the structure of mutual aid, if not eliminated it completely. The second scholar which Silvia Federici criticizes is Michel Foucault, and she does this through three points. First, before Michel Foucault, feminist activists and theorists understanding of the body were taken as the substantial factor since the early 1970s to analyze the positions of male and female in society avant la lettre. Second, Michel Foucault argues that in modern society, physical violence has declined, and given its place to Psychological abuse.https://non.copyriot.com/maria-mies-silvia-federici-and-biopower/ By beginning her analysis from [witch-hunts] and giving contemporary examples, she has put emphasize on ongoing violence against women with colonial means of domination of men, which is omitted in Michel Foucault's analysis. Third, she criticizes him for writing the ‚ÄúHistory of Sexuality‚Äù (1978) from a ‚Äúuniversal, abstract, asexual subject‚ÄùFederici, 2004: 16 which enabled him to completely omit a historical event of gendered violence as big as the witch- hunt. Historical Background After the Black Death (1347-1351) drastically reduced the working population in Europe, it was increasingly difficult for feudal lords to control and discipline the peasants. Because of the scarcity of peasants capable of work, the ones who did work developed strategies against the corrupted lords such as leaving the harvest to rot or simply not finishing the work. This was possible due to the subsistence economy in which the work was being paid for with products and the right to work on the land, not with money like in the monetary economy. They grew their own food and were not dependent on money for buying basic materials. It was also a solidarity economy in which women would share labor, such as care work, in between themselves, parallel to sharing work with men, such as working in the field. This division was a source of emancipation rather than the opposite because it enabled them to have autonomy over their work, as well as over their bodies. Women played a big political role in these societies. When the monetary economy was introduced, only men were entitled to receive payment, after which began the marginalization of women's labor from the economical and political realms of the society. The majority of witch hunts occurred between 1500 and 1650, with a peak around the 1620, according to Federici. It was the time when the ideology of Mercantilism shaped the perceptions of European elites. Having a big labor force was a necessary precondition to having a successful economy. In the context of the aftermath of the Black Death, the question of population control was obvious to them, so began the ‚Äúdemographic recording, census-taking, and the formalization of demography itself as the first ‚Äòstate science‚Äô‚Äù.Federici, 2004: 182 Finding a way of systematically increasing the size of the labor force was an important political goal for the ruling class and the nascent bourgeoisie. The way to systematically increase the size of the labor force was to gain control over the reproduction of society. Women were through this lens seen only as wombs that produce children who will enter the labor force. To gain this control the states used ‚Äúmulti- media propaganda to generate a mass psychosis among the population.‚Äù .Federici, 2004: 168 This propaganda machine included names such as Thomas Hobbes and Jean Bodin, but also many other government officials who traveled the countries and spread the propaganda about witches. The state also used the policing apparatus and methods created by the Inquisition in the previous centuries. They successfully sowed distrust which disintegrated small societies. Their main target was lower-class women which nevertheless had knowledges that were of crucial importance for the autonomy and integrity of their societies. Knowledge such as healing, birth control, and midwifery came in direct opposition to the state interests and the new mechanical paradigm. Many of these women were hunted down, put through unfair trials, and brutally murdered. One of the ways to gain control over the reproductive force of the population was to put the practices of midwifery under a strict state control. Many of the witches were also midwives or ‚Äúwise women‚Äù, and traditionally the practices of midwifery and obstetrics were exclusive to women until the 16th and 17th century. In the 16th century there was a new precondition to being a midwife ‚Äî the woman had to demonstrate beforehand that she was a ‚Äúgood Catholic‚Äù.Federici, 2004:183 In the 17th century there began to appear the first male midwives and ‚Äúwithin a century, obstetrics has come almost entirely under state control.‚ÄùFederici, 2004: 183-184 Under this interpretation, the witch trials in Europe would have been of a political background, rather than strictly gender- focused outlook, religious or otherwise. However, even this explanation for the widespread trials reflects a misogynistic and female- controlling frame of mind.

He has published histories of Unilever, and has more recently written on the history of sustainable business worldwide. In 2017 he published a historical study of green entrepreneurship from the nineteenth century until the present day called Profits and Sustainability. A History of Green Entrepreneurship (Oxford, 2017) Life Born in Birmingham, Jones attended Corpus Christi, Cambridge. After receiving his PhD, he worked there as a research fellow. He then became a lecturer in economic history at the London School of Economics before becoming a professor in business history at the University of Reading. In 1997 he founded the Centre for International Business History at the University of Reading.[ Jones served twice as President of the Association of Business Historians (1992‚Äì93 and 2000-1), President of the European Business History Association (1997‚Äì1999) and President of the Business History Conference (2001‚Äì2002). Between 1988 and 2003 Jones was the co-editor of the journal Business History. In 2002 he moved to Harvard Business School. In 2012 he was appointed Faculty Chair of the Business History Initiative at Harvard Business School. Subsequently, the Business History Initiative developed a project called Creating Emerging Markets, designed to facilitate research and teaching on the business history of emerging markets, which includes interviews with long-time leaders of firms and NGOs in Latin America, South Asia, Turkey and Africa. Jones holds an honorary Doctorate in Economics and Business Administration from Copenhagen Business School, Denmark, and an honorary Phd from the University of Helsinki, Finland.

Work Jones initially researched relationships between business and governments. He published historical monographs on the oil industry and international banking. From the 1980s, Jones, alongside Mark Casson, was also involved in calling for a more theoretical approach to business history, particularly in the use of economic theory. During this period he wrote historical studies of industries over long time periods, including British Multinational Banking 1830-1990 (Oxford, 1993) and Merchants to Multinationals (Oxford, 2000). Merchants to Multinationals was awarded the Newcomen-Harvard Prize for the best business history book published in the United States between 1998 and 2000, and the Wadsworth Prize for the best work of business history published in Britain in 2000. After moving to Harvard Business School, Jones published books on the history of global business, including Multinationals and Global Capitalism (Oxford, 2005). In 2010, Jones published Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry (Oxford, 2010). In this book, and elsewhere, Jones has sought both to explain the growth of the beauty industry and to explore its impact over the last century on homogenizing beauty ideals worldwide.He has written Harvard Business School cases on leading entrepreneurs in the industry, including the iconic Helena Rubinstein, the founder of the American luxury cosmetics sector. Recently Jones has focused on the history of green business and sustainability, and has written on the societal responsibilities of capitalism.http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/14-004_2fbc7e4e-09a2-4c52-9b15-910b43fa0d5b.pdf In addition to the Creating Emerging Markets project, he has also researched the business history of emerging markets, including Latin America and Turkey. Jones and co-authors have called for the business history of emerging markets to be mainstreamed in the discipline as a whole, and seen as an alternative business history rather than merely adding new settings to explore established core debates Jones has encouraged international business scholars to test theories against historical evidence. In 2006 he and Tarun Khanna published a widely cited article in the Journal of International Business Studies, the premier international business journal, on this issue. More recently Jones and Khanna have published on the importance of corporate reputation in emerging markets, employing data from the Creating Emerging Markets project. Jones has warned of the risks to the world economy of economic nationalism and populism. In 2017, Jones suggested the world economy was undergoing a process of de- globalization.

Levine and Bear McCreary, Trevor Morris, Ramin Djawadi and Mark Snow. Unlike previous Academy television music concerts, notably two at the Hollywood Bowl, the show focused almost entirely on current or recent program music, spotlighting suites created by composers especially for the concert. An opening video of theme-music clips from nearly 90 classic TV shows led seamlessly into a live medley of main titles from 24 contemporary series, which was arranged by 6-time Emmy winner Mark Watters.http://www.emmys.com/news/member-news/composers-score-big-special-tv- music-concert Shows featured in the medley included Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Copper, The Amazing Race, Survivor, Parks and Recreation, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Americans, Modern Family and Veep.

He is the founder and president of the animal rights organization Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK). Born in St. Paul, Minnesota, Hindi grew up in a hunting and fishing culture. In 1985, he caught a 230-pound Mako shark in a feat that received a writeup in the New York Daily News. He ceased hunting and fishing after witnessing a live pigeon shoot in Pennsylvania on Labor Day, September 4, 1989. Shocked and disgusted by the sight of thousands of pigeons getting shot after flying from boxes, Hindi vowed to give up his hunting hobby and fight against it instead. Hindi founded the Fox Valley Animal Protectors, which evolved into the Chicago Animal Rights Coalition (CHARC) in 1993 and is currently called Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), to document animal abuse and disseminate information. Hindi's animal rights activism with the organization has involved lobbying legislators to pass laws against animal cruelty and documenting and protesting against rodeos, live pigeon shoots, geese shoots, bullfighting, horse slaughter, and deer killing. He posts video footage of animal abuse on SHARK's YouTube channel. Hindi served a stint as shipping and receiving clerk at Carol Stream, Illinois-based Allied Rivet (then called Allied Tubular Rivet), a company that manufactures tubular rivets, before purchasing the company in the mid-1980s, becoming its president, and moving it to Geneva, Illinois. In 1992, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for a seat in the Illinois General Assembly against Tom Cross. Personal life Born in St. Paul, Minnesota,Page, Bill.

Steve Hindi grew up in a St. Paul housing project with his mother, Esther, and younger brother, Gregory (\\"Greg\\"). While he was a young child, his father deserted the family. His mother took care of him and his brother with the help of welfare. They initially lived in the slums and later moved to the housing project Roosevelt Homes, located at the east of St. Paul. When he was bullied by another boy in junior high, Hindi fought back and discovered that \\"often when you stand up to a bully he backs down\\". Hindi said, \\"But then I became a bit of a bully myself.\\" He lived in several foster homes and had brushes with the law as a teenager, committing petty theft and getting sent to a youth detention center. Upon graduating from high school, Hindi served as a bus driver for United Cerebral Palsy of Minnesota. He later became an aide at St. Paul's Union Gospel Mission. When he was in his early 20s, he traveled to Chicago around 1978, to become a rock musician. Hindi was the guitarist and was frequently the singer in a group that played at clubs near and in Chicago. According to The Morning Calls Susan Todd, Hindi led a \\"down-and-out life as a struggling rock musician\\".Todd, Susan.

Hindi told the Chicago Reader in 1993, \\"I got the nagging feeling that this wasn't going to work out as I had planned\\" and decided to change careers to work as a shipping and receiving clerk at Allied Rivet. In 1995, he resided in Kendall County, Illinois, with Jacquelyn (\\"Jacquie\\"), his wife, and his two daughters, Meghan and Eva. The family had five dogs and seven cats. Hindi and Jacquie met in 1979 and around 1999 had an amicable divorce, continuing to be friends and business partners. Hindi's animal rights activism caused his marriage to end. His repeated traveling and imprisonment turned away his wife, who said in a 2004 interview with the Daily Herald, \\"It was the downfall of our marriage. I was just thinking 'I'm raising these kids alone' and 'I'm out.'\\" She said that after they separated, she grew closer to Christianity. She forgave him and backed his purpose, saying in 2004, \\"A lot of people will say animal activists don't care about humans, but that is not the case with Steve. He just feels this is where his calling is and this is where his drive is. He's a great person and a great father, too.\\" Jacquie died on May 27, 2014, at the age of 56. Hindi has a black belt in karate and a pilot's license. Hindi said in a 1994 interview with the Chicago Tribune that he supports the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In 2001, Hindi lived in Kane County, Illinois. He stored hundreds of videotapes of animals in a \\"floor-to-ceiling cabinet\\" in his living room, assigning them titles like \\"Rodeo Cruelty\\", \\"Making Foie Gras\\", and \\"Pennsylvania Pigeon Shoot\\". Some of the videos were shot at bullfights, circuses, and roadside zoos. Shelves held small cameras, stun guns, and walkie-talkies. In 2012, Hindi lived in Elburn, Kane County, Illinois.

Allied Rivet Instead of attending college, at age 23 Hindi switched to being a shipping and receiving clerk at Carol Stream, Illinois- based Allied Tubular Rivet (later renamed to Allied Rivet), a company that manufactures tubular rivets. The company made millions of rivets for air ducts, toys and other products. He became the operator of the company's manufacturing shop. His father-in-law bought the company in 1982 and sold it to Hindi about five years later. After paying $240,000 to buy the company, Hindi became its president. After reading a newspaper series about the homeless in April 1990, Hindi employed several homeless people at the company; the project was unsuccessful. In the early 1990s, he moved Allied Rivet to Geneva. In 1993, Allied Rivet had $2 million in annual sales and employed around 20 people, including his brother Greg, a \\"supersalesman\\", Hindi said. In 2007, Hindi's former wife Jacquie said that Hindi transformed their company Allied Rivet into a \\"very successful, multimillion-dollar company\\". 1992 political campaign Hindi ran a campaign in the Republican primary against Assistant Kendall County States Attorney Tom Cross for representing Kendall County in the 84th district of the Illinois House of Representatives. His campaign platform called for school vouchers and \\"responsible\\" economic development that focused on \\"good jobs\\" rather than \\"a zillion jobs\\". Hindi said about a challenge to his campaign, \\"The farmers, being hunters, hit me up real good on animal issues.\\" Fatal to his campaign was that he was self-funded and was not supported by an organization. Hindi \\"lost badly\\" in the primary. Hunting and fishing Raised in a culture filled with hunting and fishing. Hindi said, \\"My mother brought me up to be kind to animals and to care for them, but I didn't make the connection between abuse and hunting until years later.\\" His mother taught him to nurture cats and dogs, taking in abandoned pets even though this violated housing project policies. Fish, on the other hand, were not considered sentient beings, so Hindi \\"killed them with abandon\\". In addition to striking carps with rocks, Hindi as a child once placed an M-80 firecracker into a strangling carp's gills, lit the waterproof fuse, and placed it back in water. Hindi wrote in an Animal People piece, \\"Seconds later the water erupted in a red spray. When the muddy water cleared, we saw the carp's head, blasted away from his body.\\" Having read the book Sport Fishing for Sharks and watched the movie Jaws, Hindi drove from Illinois to Long Island Sound, New York, planning to catch a shark. Hindi received coverage from the New York Daily News after catching a seven-foot-long, 230-pound Mako shark in 1985. After wrestling the shark for five hours to move it within shooting distance of his bass boat, Hindi shot its head with a .357 Magnum. By the time he defeated the shark, there were 32 shell casings on the boat's floor. Owing to the shark's heavy weight, Hindi was unable to pull it onto his boat so instead fastened a rope around its tail and headed back to shore. But towing the heavy shark was more fit for a 30-foot boat than Hindi's 17-foot one. He discovered that his boat was not moving much after throwing a shred of Styrofoam into the water which turned from even to ripply. Unable to get a freighter to stop and help him, he refused to let go of the shark. Hindi reasoned, \\"I'd taken the shark's life. I couldn't let it go. And nobody in the world will believe it if I cut it loose.\\" Two people in a sailboat saw Hindi and asked the United States Coast Guard to help him. The Coast Guard captain asked Hindi to get rid of the shark but Hindi declined. The captain sent a deputy to help Hindi move the shark onto the Coast Guard ship. Inspired by Jaws, he set a great white shark as his next target, purchasing a 23-foot boat, but changed his mind after witnessing an event that turned him towards animal rights activism. In a 2004 interview with Garrett Odower of the Daily Herald, Hindi called his struggles with the shark \\"misguided\\". Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot Hindi hunted until Labor Day, September 4, 1989. He was coming home from shark fishing on the East Coast when he witnessed the Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot, a live pigeon shoot in Hegins, Pennsylvania, that happened yearly. He decided to attend the event after hearing about it three years prior from the group Animal Rights Mobilization (ARM). The sight of 7,000 to 8,000 pigeons being \\"shot right out of a box\\" convinced Hindi no longer to hunt. In August 1990, Hindi challenged Robert Tobash, a Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot organizer and businessman, to a fistfight that would end when either of the men could not continue fighting. If Tobash won, Hindi would donate $10,000 to the Hegins Park Association. If Hindi won, the shoot would be discontinued and Tobash would donate $10,000 to the park. Tobash declined to respond to Hindi's fistfight proposal, telling the Standard-Speaker that Hindi's \\"challenge is crazy in the first place. He can't call the shoot off and neither can I, because neither one of us has control of it.\\" Tobash said that the pigeon shoot was organized by a 200-person group, the Hegins Labor Day Committee. On Labor Day in 1990, Hindi and his brother Gregory protested at the Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot and were both arrested. Hindi said he kicked in the window of a driver who was trying to run into demonstrators at the pigeon shoot and was arrested. Hindi said in a 2007 interview with The State Journal-Register that the driver hit him, causing him to spring onto the car's hood. When he stayed on the hood, the driver increased speed and slammed onto the brakes in an attempt to knock Hindi off the car. Hindi remained on the hood and kicked the glass, shattering it. The driver continued driving for a couple hundred feet while Hindi was still on the hood. Hindi said he wriggled under another car to protect himself from the enraged observers and was saved by state police. Local officials disagreed with Hindi's side of the story, saying that while the car was passing through a throng of protesters, Hindi leaped onto the car and kicked in the windshield. The Schuylkill County District Attorney charged with him disorderly conduct and criminal mischief on September 20, 1990, for causing $1,100 of damage to the car whose windshield he had shattered. Hindi's brother, Gregory, who lived in Wichita, Kansas, received a disorderly conduct charge because police accused of him obstructing a mounted police officer by stretching out in the middle of the path. In 1992, after the Ku Klux Klan said they would attend the pigeon shoot to demonstrate their approval of freedom and the right to keep and bear arms, Hindi published a press release saying he started the \\"Black Berets\\" group. Hindi said that because law enforcement in past years had refused to guard the activists from harm, the activists would supply their own protection. Martial arts experts would wear black berets; hence, they would be called \\"Black Berets\\". Local officials predicted that attending the pigeon shoot would be more than a hundred Black Berets, whose \\"any attempts at intimidation or violence\\" would be dealt with. In actuality, Hindi said \\"it was a wonderful scam\\", \\"it was never anything more than a joke on the shoot supporters\\", and only a dozen people with black berets attended. The pigeon shoot began every year with a prayer breakfast during which an ordained minister would pray and the national anthem would be sung. Prior to the breakfast's planned start time, the Black Berets took their vegan breakfast to the picnic location. After community members showed up, they observed the Black Berets praying for \\"the deliverance of the pigeons from the evil clutches of those whose hearts are hardened against them\\". Neglecting to eat breakfast or pray, the community members immediately exited the picnic area. Hindi told author Norm Phelps on August 17, 2006, \\"They were there to take the lives of the pigeons, and we were there to take the fun out of killing.\\" Pigeon shoot facilitators cancelled the event in 1999 after a July 1999 decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Court did not explicitly illegalize the event, instead ruling that Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals humane officers were permitted to arrest people who abused the pigeons before or after the pigeons got shot. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice John P. Flaherty Jr. called the pigeon shoot \\"cruel and moronic\\". Early animal rights activism Upon observing the pigeon shoot, Hindi refused to wear leather. He gave his shark boat to a conservation association. After his wife, Jacquie, said she saw at a veterinary clinic an undernourished calf that had been saved from an auction in a barn, Hindi did some research and converted to vegetarianism. Upon ceasing to hunt, Hindi stopped fishing because he said he realized \\"the fight the fish was giving me on the other end of the line was actually its death throes\\". In 1990, Hindi made a phone call to Animals Agenda (a now inoperative publication). He told editor Merritt Clifton, who later edited Animal People, his hope of preserving hunting as a sport by \\"doing away with unsportsmanlike practices\\" such as the pigeon shoot he observed. Save for the intimate friends he recruited to the undertaking, fellow hunters refused to side with him. Because he believed in ethical hunting, his views did not align with those of animal rights organizations at the time. Being wedged between the two positions convinced him to establish his own animal rights organization, the Chicago Animal Rights Coalition. Soon after starting the group, Hindi became opposed to all hunting, throwing away his hunting trophies and becoming a vegan, a practice he later discontinued. He said he did not have the willpower to be vegan, and instead became a vegetarian, wearing nylon belts and synthetic sandals instead of leather. Clifton said Hindi focuses on specific animal rights issues like pigeon shoots, bullfighting, rodeos, and horse slaughter because they are men's issues that other activists are less inclined to approach. Most animal rights activists are women, Clifton said, who aim their attention at women's issues like dressing in fur coats and using animals to test makeup. To help put an end to the 30-year hunting hobby he now detests, Hindi protests hunts in Illinois and elsewhere. He told the Chicago Tribune in a 1992 interview that regarding hunters, he \\"decided it would be more sporting for me to fight them than to fight the animals\\". He continued, \\"I do still hunt-but I hunt hunters now.\\" To protest hunts, Hindi and a group of other activists tailed the hunter, scared away the prey by being loud, and sometimes got in the line of fire. Hindi said hunting is not necessary in modern society to gather food, so to hunt animals \\"for the fun of man or woman already denotes a certain loss of ethic\\". Jim Ritter of the Chicago Sun-Times said in 1995 that Hindi was \\"perhaps the most admired animal rights crusader in the Chicago area. And the most hated.\\" The Morning Calls Paul Carpenter, who like Hindi wanted the Hegins pigeon shoot to shut down, wrote that Hindi \\"calibrate[s] our moral compasses\\" and is a \\"brave underground freedom fighter\\". Chicago Tribune columnist John Husar wrote in 1996 that Hindi was \\"Chicago's most radical anti-hunting activist\\". Joel Patenaude of The Beacon News wrote in 1998 that for Hindi, \\"among sympathetic souls, he is considered creative, tenacious and effective\\". Live pigeon shoots and turkey shoots In 1992, Hindi served as the president of the Fox Valley Animal Protectors in DuPage County, Illinois. Hindi noticed that live pigeon shoots were happening in the field behind Carpy's Cove, a tavern and restaurant in Will County, Illinois. About four times a year, a dozen to two dozen shooters would pay $100 to shoot 25 pigeons each. Every Sunday, Hindi drove to the bar to check whether people were preparing for a live pigeon shoot. Whenever he found pigeon shoot preparations, Hindi notified around two dozen activists to join him in protesting the shoot. The Seneca Hunt Club, one of Hindi's earliest aims, held pigeon shoots overseen by the Illinois Conservation Department (now named the Illinois Department of Natural Resources). Hindi attacked the Illinois Conservation Department, calling it names like \\"Department of Cowards\\", \\"Department of Chickens\\", \\"Department of Mutilation\\", \\"Department of Scumbags\\", and \\"Department of Corruption\\". Following lobbying and activism by Hindi's group and other animal activist groups, the Illinois General Assembly overturned a law that permitted pigeon shoots. In 1992, the office of the Illinois Attorney General published an unofficial notice that said holding pigeon shoots likely would violate Illinois' animal care act. According to a 2007 The State Journal-Register article, pigeon shoots have been prohibited in Illinois since Hindi convinced the Illinois Attorney General's office that pigeon shoots infringed on the state's animal cruelty statutes. The Pennsylvania Record reported in April 2014 that \\"Pennsylvania is believed to be the only state left in the nation in which shooting pigeons strictly for sport is still legal.\\" The Philadelphia Media Network reported the same month that Pennsylvania is the \\"only state\\" to allow live pigeon shooting and that since 1989, repeated bill introductions in the Pennsylvania General Assembly to outlaw live pigeon shooting were unsuccessful. On June 11, 1995, Hindi surreptitiously filmed a turkey shoot at the Lone Pine Sportsmens Club in Middleport, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. In a September 1995 interview with The Morning Call, he said the turkey shoot was \\"graphic animal abuse more shocking than the infamous Hegins pigeon shoot\\". At a turkey shoot, the turkeys are situated in a bundle of car tires behind hay bales and their feet are shackled. Participants strike a turkey's head from a distance of 100 yards by using rifles or bows. In August 2014, Hindi received a message from a supporter of Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe about a pigeon shoot fundraiser for the 2014 Senate election at Quartz Mountain Lodge in Lone Wolf, Oklahoma, called the \\"Jim Inhofe Dove Hunt\\". The hunt took place on September 5, 2014, and was in its tenth year. Hindi sent an uncover SHARK investigator to videotape the pigeon shoot. Shoot participants kicked injured pigeons and ignored pigeons who were dying. The video of the shoot was posted on the website InhofeCruelty.com. Inhofe, United States Representative Markwayne Mullin, and Principal Chief of the Cherokee Bill John Baker attended the pigeon shoot. In a September 23, 2014, interview with the Associated Press, he said, \\"Hunting is not supposed to be wanton slaughter. This is the antithesis of hunting. Every hunter, and every gun owner for that matter, should be infuriated by this.\\" Hindi held a press conference at the Oklahoma State Capitol on September 30, demanding that the federal government open an investigation into animal cruelty. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and The Humane Society of the United States both criticized the shoot. Woodstock Hunt Club On three weekends in September and October 1996, Hindi and fellow Chicago Animal Rights Coalition members protested on land next to the Woodstock Hunt Club, an 85-member club. Using sirens, megaphones, air horns, and aircraft, the activists protested on land bordering the club, scaring away geese. The protests violated the Illinois Hunter Interference Act of 1984, which barred protesters from trying to discourage hunters from killing animals, scaring hunted animals away, and impeding active hunters. McHenry County Circuit Judge James Franz issued a temporary restraining order on October 11 prohibiting protests at the club. On October 12, Hindi fastened to his back a small engine to charge an ultralight aircraft, a 20-horsepower Daiichi Kosho Whisper, fashioned to disturb hunters below it. With a seat and a parasail, the aircraft was powered by a motor, and Hindi ran to raise its sails. Circuit Judge Franz found Hindi in contempt of court on November 6 for ignoring the court's restraining order by continuing his protests at the Woodstock Hunt Club. Franz sentenced Hindi to six months in jail without bail. On November 13, Hindi started an 11-day hunger strike in McHenry County Jail. The hunger strike ended after Hindi was released from jail following a three- member appellate panel decision that Hindi could not be held without bond. In September 1997, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld Circuit Judge Franz's conviction and sentencing of Hindi for contempt of court. and he returned to jail in February 1998. Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn wrote in support of Hindi, saying: The Illinois Supreme Court ruled on March 5, 1998, that Hindi should be released on bond while he appealed his case. In a bench trial, Hindi was convicted in January 1999 of violating the Illinois Hunter Interference Act of 1984 by flying his glider near geese to scare them away from hunters. Judge Gordon Graham sentenced him to 18 months conditional discharge in April 1999, saying during the sentencing, \\"In my analysis, I don't believe Mr. Hindi will benefit by or be deterred by incarceration.\\" The Woodstock Hunt Club sued Hindi and his group for $411,000, alleging that the club had to refund their customers' payments because of Hindi and his group's protests. Bullfighting Hindi considers bullfighting to be animal abuse. A 2003 Los Angeles Times article noted that he dared a matador to battle him rather than the bull but the matador refused. In April 2000, Hindi owned PepsiCo stock worth about $5,000. In 1998, after Hindi found out that PepsiCo sponsored Mexican and Spanish bullfights, he was incensed. Members of Hindi's group traveled to Mexico to film bullfights. The Daily Herald said, \\"The results are not for the weak of stomach, as the bulls are shown bleeding profusely.\\" Hindi wrote letters to PepsiCo asking the company to cease sponsoring the bullfights and started a website, www.pepsibloodbath.com, that featured images and videos of bloody bulls next to Pepsi's blue banners. The website featured a Pepsi logo that seemed to be dripping blood and said the site \\"will be removed when Pepsi halts its support of cruel bullfights around the world\\". He discarded every Pepsi drink from his company's vending machine. Hindi spoke at a California conference with Indian animal rights activists who sent bullfighting videos to then-Indian Minister of State of Social Justice and Empowerment, Maneka Gandhi, the founder of People for Animals. Gandhi wrote an October 31, 1999, letter to Pepsi protesting their bullfighting sponsorship and planned to show SHARK's videos on her two animal rights television stations in India, where cows are believed to be sacred. In the last week of December 1999, PepsiCo discontinued being a sponsor for Mexican bullfights. The Chicago Tribunes Bill Page said Pepsi's decision was likely influenced by Mexican bullfighting photos shot by SHARK members showing a bull \\"impaled with pics and spewing gore and blood‚Äîall against the backdrop of a Pepsi banner\\". A PepsiCo spokesperson admitted in a December 1999 interview with The Beacon News that Hindi's efforts were \\"a significant contributing factor\\" in the company's bullfighting sponsorship retraction in its taking down billboards in hundreds of bullrings. Rodeos =Wauconda, Illinois, rodeo= Hindi said in 1995 regarding rodeos that they \\"exist on the fear, pain and suffering of animals and their desire to escape\\". Using a hidden camera, Hindi videotaped rodeos, capturing many hours of what he called rodeo abuse, including bucking and electric prodding. He and fellow activists used bullhorns to protest rodeos organized by the Wauconda Chamber of Commerce in Wauconda, Illinois, and the Lake County sheriff's police union. In a 2004 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Hindi said he and his group had been protesting the Wauconda Rodeo since 1993. In 1997, he sent antagonistic messages with the letterhead \\"An animal abuser's worst nightmare\\". Hindi used a video camera capable of recording footage from the distance of over a block to videotape rodeo workers bending animals' tails, flinging sand into their faces, and jabbing them in their sides. The Wauconda Rodeo video showed horses with injuries to their haunches, a steer getting kicked, another steer's tail getting yanked, and children traveling around on sheep. His video received coverage in the TV news, and Lake County State's Attorney Mike Waller launched an investigation into Hindi's animal abuse accusation. Waller asked the Illinois Department of Agriculture and three veterinarians to review the video. The veterinarians said no animal cruelty was shown in the video because the methods used by the rodeo workers were commonly used with sizable animals. Waller dismissed the activists' complaints against the rodeo, saying that the veterinarians unanimously concluded that Illinois' Humane Care for Animals Act was not violated. In July 1994, Hindi protested at the Wauconda Rodeo, filming the rodeo's rear from the west side of U.S. Route 12. He said the Wauconda mayor's truck stopped near his team, and he told the mayor, \\"It's really stupid you're supporting this.\\" They had a heated argument, and Hindi said the mayor's passenger backhanded him in the face, striking his nose and cheek. The district attorney dismissed the battery accusation, citing the contradictory witness accounts by the seven spectators his office interviewed and the lack of injury to Hindi. Hindi volunteered to take a polygraph to confirm his description of what happened, but the district attorney declined, noting that courts do not permit polygraph conclusions. =Kane County, Illinois, rodeo= In May 1998, Hindi asked the Kane County Board to support an ordinance that would prohibit the use of techniques such as electric prods and spurs to force animals to participate in rodeos. He cited the passage of a law in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that banned the abuse of rodeo animals. Noting that the law had the expected result of ending rodeos in Pittsburgh, Hindi said, \\"It has been our experience that you can't conduct a rodeo without cruelty.\\" The 1998 request was unsuccessful. In 2001, Hindi repeated his request, asking the board to bar people under 18 from taking part in rodeo events like sheep riding. On June 9, 1998, to demonstrate stun guns hurt rodeo animals, Hindi attended a Kane County Board meeting and asked board members to volunteer to be shocked by a stun gun. Rodeo participants had told the board that stun guns were harmless to animals. No one volunteered to get stunned to see if the stun gun hurt, so Hindi shocked himself multiple times. Regarding the shock from the stun gun, he said, \\"It hurt like hell.\\" He said the shock felt like a \\"very, very hard slap\\" on his arm and likened it to the excruciating pain imposed by the Nazi doctor character portrayed by Laurence Olivier in the 1976 movie Marathon Man. =Alone Against the Rodeo documentary= In October 2000, the European television network Arte filmed a documentary featuring Hindi and rodeos. Arte filmmakers shadowed Hindi on a 10-day trip to rodeos in Arkansas and Texas. Titled \\"A Bas le Rodeo\\" (\\"Alone Against the Rodeo\\"), the documentary was slated to be shown on Animal Planet in May 2001. The documentary received the Brigitte Bardot International Genesis Award in 2001. =2002 Cultural Olympiad rodeo= In September 1998, Hindi wrote a letter protesting the proposed rodeos at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah. In the letter, Hindi said, \\"The purpose of this letter is to urge you not to taint the Winter Olympics with animal abuse. However, if you should ignore this very good advice, know that we will use your rodeos to spread the truth about these abusive activities to a worldwide audience.\\" Hindi and other animal rights activists asked the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) to cancel the Olympic Command Performance Rodeo, a 2002 Cultural Olympiad event, or sever the SLOC's relationship with the event, which was scheduled from February 9‚Äì11 in Farmington, Utah. Hindi said that the animal rights groups would protest at the rodeo only and not during the torch relay and the 2002 Winter Olympics if the SLOC disaffiliated itself from the rodeo. Hindi said, \\"If there is no connection between the Olympics and the rodeo, there would be no reason for us to protest at the Games.\\" Hindi said he hoped that ticket holders would request refunds if the rodeo was no longer a part of the Cultural Olympiad. Hindi scheduled a debate about rodeo at the Salt Lake City Public Library on January 2, 2002, with five people, three of whom were Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association executives and two of whom were Deseret News columnists who had questioned the animal rights activists' tactics. Hindi set up five chairs at the library's auditorium, each labeled with an invited debater's name, but none of them showed up. Several of the invitees cited schedule conflicts in explaining why they were not able to attend. SLOC President Mitt Romney decided on January 4, 2002, not to cancel or disassociate the SLOC from the rodeo but imposed safety precautions that banned tail twisting and electric prodding. Hindi said he would praise Romney if Romney banned from the event calf roping, steer roping, and steer wrestling, practices Hindi called the cruelest parts of rodeo. Sixty animal rights activists protested the event, and Hindi brought a van with large projection screens that showed past instances of animal cruelty at rodeos. =Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo= Singer Carrie Underwood and band Matchbox Twenty called off their concerts at the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo in 2006 and 2008, respectively, upon viewing Hindi's rodeo videos. SHARK sent to Matchbox Twenty video clips filmed in 2007 at Frontier Days, which showed the \\"contorted positions and twisted necks of roped animals\\". Hindi told the Associated Press in 2008, \\"We were watching for the lineup at Cheyenne, because if we found some people with a propensity toward animal care, we were going to get in touch with them.\\" Matchbox Twenty cancelled their performance due to the animal abuse accusations, while Carrie Underwood did not explain why she called off her performance. Hindi was sued by Cheyenne Frontier Days' booking company, Romeo Entertainment Group, for allegedly spreading \\"false and misleading information\\" and \\"threats of negative publicity\\" to persuade the performers not to perform at the rodeo. United States District Court for the District of Wyoming Judge William F. Downes dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that it was filed in the wrong state. In 2008, Hindi created the website ShameOnCheyenne.com to condemn the Cheyenne Frontier Days and record animal mistreatment at the rodeo. =Passage of rodeo laws= After lobbying from Hindi since 1998, the St. Charles, Illinois, City Council in May 2001 changed the city ordinance to ban people from employing electric prods in slides except when someone is in danger. In 2013, the Oregon Legislative Assembly banned horse tripping when used for amusement. Film from SHARK and The Humane Society of the United States was the impetus for the law, which punished violators with a jail sentence of six months or a $2,500 fine. =2013 traffic stop after the Big Loop Rodeo= On May 19, 2013, Hindi attended the Jordan Valley, Oregon, Big Loop Rodeo to document animal abuse and was told by planners to leave the event. After Hindi left, his rental car was followed for 10 miles by two sheriff's deputies from Malheur County, Oregon, on orders from a lieutenant supervisor. Hindi filed a Freedom of Information Act for the officers' dashcam video. The Daily Dot reported that forgetting to turn off their dashcam video, the sheriff's deputies \\"admit to pulling him over illegally for the sake of intimidation\\" on camera. The Associated Press reported that when Hindi was stopped by the officers, \\"[t]here was no probable cause a crime or traffic violation had been committed.\\" Portions of the officers' dialogue: Having videotaped the officers' following him for ten miles and the subsequent traffic stop, Hindi obtained the officers' dash cam footage and uploaded everything to YouTube. The incident was discussed on reddit's /r/justiceporn, receiving over 1,200 comments. Malheur County Sheriff Brian E. Wolfe told the Associated Press in August 2013 that he was sending all of the recordings and details to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for review by the agency. The Tiger Hindi placed 100-inch video projector screens \\"surmounted by 6-foot electronic moving message signs\\" on his silver Isuzu Motors delivery truck. Named the Tiger, the refurbished truck had a $150,000 price tag and was driven by Hindi to crowded places. The Tiger's first public appearance was in December 2000 at the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas. In February 2001, Hindi positioned the Tiger in a parking lot near the Chicago Auto Show. With the sky darkening, Hindi turned on his four signs, illuminating them with vivid red words: \\"STOP ANIMAL ABUSE\\". The four video screens concurrently showed a looping video of a calf at a rodeo. In the video, after the calf exits from a chute, someone causes the animal to fall by roping its neck and dragging it across dirt. The Chicago Tribunes Bill Page said the \\"effect was stunning\\". People who had been rushing to the Chicago Auto Show entrance \\"stopped in their tracks and gazed open-mouthed\\" at Hindi's signs and video. Although most of the people did not speak to Hindi, some asked him questions as he stood next to his truck. In May 2001, Hindi protested the Walker Brothers Circus event at the Kane County Events Center (now named the Fifth Third Bank Ballpark). He drove around in the Tiger, showcasing film of Tyke, an elephant owned by Hawthorn Corporation, which manages Walker Brothers Circus' animals. Tyke was slaughtered for fatally attacking a trainer in 1994. In September 2001, South Elgin's Anderson Animal Shelter planned to euthanize cats who had been there for more than three months. Hindi joined shelter employees in protesting the decision at a board meeting, bringing his truck with video monitors that said \\"Let The Cats Live\\". The board unanimously reversed its earlier decision to euthanize the cats. During the 2002 Winter Olympics, Hindi used the Tiger to protest the Olympic Command Performance Rodeo. He took the truck along the torch relay, following it for over 7,000 miles from Chicago, to the West Coast of the United States, to Salt Lake City. He drove it to other Olympic events to show film of animal cruelty at rodeos. The Salt Lake Tribunes Lori Buttars called the Tiger a \\"high-tech propaganda-mobile featuring television monitors showing videotaped acts of animal cruelty\\". Explicit animal abuse photos were imprinted on the truck's doors. In bright red, the truck's flashing signs said, \\"Cruelty is not in the Olympic Spirit\\", and the word \\"not\\" was struck out. 10,000 journalists attended the Olympics, and journalists from Germany, Japan, Korea, Norway, and Sweden interviewed Hindi about his truck. Hindi faced \\"sneers, obscene gestures, colorful epithets and a few rocks and snowballs\\" in some cities, but in Salt Lake City, he received a mix of praise and criticism. In 2004, Hindi went to the front of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield to show on 100-inch screens a video of a horse-slaughter plant in Texas filmed by a colleague. In the secretly taken video, a plant employee approaches a horse with a captive bolt pistol. Partially hidden by sheet metal, the horse can be knocked senseless by one strike. But unlike cows, who are stunned by the same apparatus, horses have longer necks and a dissimilar skull structure that makes stunning more challenging. Horses attempt to evade the stunner, and small parts of its skull become wedged in its brain, ultimately rendering it unconscious. Workers hang the horse by its back legs and cut its throat. The Daily Heralds Garrett Ordower wrote that \\"While many animal rights groups use their voices as their weapon, Hindi uses technology, specifically video.\\" Other animal rights activism In 1993, Hindi said his group would protest against the conservationists' decision to stop overpopulation of white-tailed deer by shooting them. Hindi said they would damage deer bait sites in Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve. On February 26, 1993, Circuit County Associate Judge C. Andrew Hayton convicted Hindi of trespassing in the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve on February 1. The judge levied a fine of $350 against Hindi and ordered him to stay away from the forest reserve for one year. Hindi and fellow coalition member Michael Durschmid Jr. said Hindi's conviction was incorrect because Durschmid, not Hindi, had been videotaping the deer killings in the forest. They said a ranger police officer chased Durschmid through the forest. The officer stopped the chase once he found Hindi outside the forest and arrested him. Hindi appealed Judge Hayton's conviction on the grounds that the judge neglected to tell him he could have selected a jury trial. Prosecutors admitted their oversight in a confession of error, a legal document, and an appeals court granted Hindi a new trial. In response, the county dropped the charges. Hindi sued the forest preserve district and the state's attorney who oversaw the case for $1.1 million. Beginning in April 1993, Hindi protested against Shedd Aquarium. In 1993, Hindi placed protest signs on long poles with messages like \\"Captivity Kills\\" and \\"Thanks but no tanks\\". His eight-year-old daughter, Meghan, created a sign from bed sheets that said \\"Welcome to Whale Hell\\". Hindi passed out flyers with an article from oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau titled \\"Magnificent dolphins deserve better than captivity\\". Every Sunday in 1994, Hindi and his coalition protested outside Shedd. Using a megaphone, Hindi complained about the Shedd's \\"concrete, chlorinated tanks\\" for being \\"aquaprison[s]\\" for whales and dolphins. The protests were located such that while Shedd's audience was watching the whale shows, they could see Hindi and his group's protests. Hindi's protests at Shedd earned him the name \\"Wild Man\\" in Chicago. In April 1996, Hindi parasailed over the Richmond Hunt Club in Richmond, Illinois, capturing footage of hunters' pheasant shooting from a video camera attached to his helmet. In February 2012, Hindi's group used a MikroKopter drone to attempt to capture video of a pigeon shoot at a plantation near Ehrhardt, South Carolina. In August 2013, Hindi videotaped and demonstrated against the selling of Labrador Retriever puppies from the rear cargo area of a pickup truck in a restaurant's parking lot. Stating that the parking lot pet sales entice impetuous purchasers, Hindi worried that the new puppy owners would be unready to give their pets adequate care. Pets would be discarded or sent to animal shelters. He said purchasers did not receive the puppies' healthcare records including information about vaccinations. Any issues that arose with the puppies could not be remedied, Hindi said. The purchasers bought the pets with cash so do not have documents confirming who sold them the puppies. In August 2014, Hindi denounced as animal abuse the Pig Rassling fundraiser held by the St. Patrick Catholic Church in Stephensville, Wisconsin. Held annually, the 44-year-old event involves two to six participants wrestling a pig in a sodden enclosure and depositing the animal in a bucket. Hindi's colleague videotaped the event, which SHARK said showed \\"animal abuse, animal fighting and child neglect\\". In a 15-minute video from the group, a limping pig attempts to evade people who chase it. Other pigs in the video are pounced upon and released from a couple feet in the air, causing them to \\"run away squealing and panting\\". The video also showed pigs urinating and defecating in the wet dirt. Pig Rassling participants' bodies and faces, including children's, are smeared with the dirt. After the event, Hindi took the footage and $10,000 in \\"cold, hard cash\\" to Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay's office. At the diocesan chancery, he was unable to speak with Bishop David L. Ricken but spoke with the communications director. He promised to give the money to Ricken if Ricken, the parish priest, and the \\"Pig Rassling\\" organizers would act as a substitutes for the pigs during the event. SHARK Hindi is the founder and president of SHARK, which he started in 1993. Originally called the Fox Valley Animal Protectors, the organization evolved into the Chicago Animal Rights Coalition and is currently called Showing Animals Respect and Kindness. In 1995, 400 people were subscribed to the coalition's mailing list, and the group had about a dozen very involved members. Hindi said the organization's rename from \\"Chicago Animal Rights Coalition\\" (CHARC) to \\"Showing Animals Respect and Kindness\\" (SHARK) around 1998 was to make the organization's name not geographically restrictive. A fellow activist said \\"SHARK\\" could stand for \\"Steve Hindi's Animal Rights Kommandos\\". Hindi said the group has two purposes: record animal abuse and disseminate data. The group's crest is a large shark \\"whose gaping jaws are ready to bite\\". In 1997, the coalition's mailing list grew to 600 people. Established as a charity, SHARK had a budget of between $70,000 and $80,000 in 2001. Supported by donations, SHARK received much of its funding from Hindi in 2001. In 2007, The State Journal-Register reported that tax returns revealed that SHARK received about $100,000 in donations every year and does not have paid employees. Tax forms showed that Hindi worked about 50 hours per week for SHARK. SHARK is an animal protection group based in Geneva, Illinois. The group's mission is to end animal cruelty at rodeos. Hindi posts on SHARK's YouTube channel rodeo videos and highlights animals' wounds. SHARK's YouTube channel had 40 rodeo videos that were pulled in December 2007 because of copyright complaints by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and reinstated later in the month.

The only vessel of her class, D'Entrecasteaux was intended to serve as a flagship of the cruiser squadron that defended French Indochina and other possessions in the Far East. Her construction came during a period of conflict in the French naval command between factions that favored different cruiser types; D'Entrecasteaux represented the ideas of the , who favored large cruisers for long-range operations overseas. She was armed with a main battery of two guns, the largest guns ever carried aboard a French cruiser, though their great weight, coupled with her pronounced ram bow degraded her seaworthiness. She nevertheless provided the basis for later armored cruisers. D'Entrecasteaux was initially deployed to Indochina, where she took part in Eight-Nation Alliance operations during the Boxer Uprising, including the Battle of the Taku Forts in June 1900. Problems with her guns forced her to return to France for repairs in 1903, though she returned to Indochina for another tour from 1905 to 1909. She was modernized in 1909‚Äì1912 and served as the flagship of the Training Squadron until the start of World War I in July 1914. The ship spent much of the war in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, where she assisted in the defense of the Suez Canal from Ottoman attacks and patrolled the coast of Ottoman Syria. She was transferred for operations elsewhere after 1916, including supporting Arab rebels in the Red Sea and escorting convoys in the Indian Ocean. After the war, D'Entrecasteaux helped to carry French troops back from the (Army of the East) before being placed in reserve in June 1919. She was struck from the naval register in 1922 and transferred to the Belgian Navy in 1923, where she served as a depot ship for three years. After briefly returning to France in 1926, she was sold to the Polish Navy in 1927, which renamed the vessel Kr√≥l W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV and then Ba≈Çtyk. Employed as a stationary training ship, she remained in Polish service until the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, when she was damaged by German aircraft. She was captured by the Germans and used as a barracks ship before being broken up around 1942. Background In the mid-1880s, elements in the French naval command argued over future warship construction; the advocated building long-range and fast protected cruisers for use as commerce raiders on foreign stations while a traditionalist faction preferred larger armored cruisers and small fleet scouts, both of which were to operate as part of the main fleet in home waters. This led to the development of two types of cruisers: medium ships of and smaller ships of around . By the end of the decade and into the early 1890s, the traditionalists were ascendant, leading to the construction of several armored cruisers of the , though the supporters of the secured approval for one large cruiser built according to their ideas, which became D'Entrecasteaux. They were able to leverage the acquisition of French Indochina in the 1880s, which required a permanent squadron of warships to control and defend the colony. D'Entrecasteaux was intended to serve as a flagship for the squadron, and as such, was designed with additional facilities to accommodate an admiral and his staff. Design The armored cruiser , which preceded D'Entrecasteaux Design work on the ship began in 1891 with a version armed with four guns in the same lozenge arrangement as the contemporary pre-dreadnought battleships like . They were also to carry eight guns. The (Council of Works) decided in a meeting on 7 July that displacement should be limited to if possible; this limitation precluded an armament of four large-caliber guns if the latest water-tube boilers were retained. In an attempt to keep displacement under the limit, the considered scaling down the level of armor protection or reducing the caliber or number of guns. They ultimately decided to remove the amidships 240 mm guns and to supplement the ship's firepower with four more 138 mm guns. The refined design included a sailing rig to supplement the ship's engines on long voyages overseas, but the French naval ministry issued a directive on 2 March 1892 to abandon the use of sails in cruising warships. D'Entrecasteauxs design was accordingly altered. The then issued requests for finalized designs meeting their specifications from four naval architects and three private shipyards, which were evaluated during a meeting on 29 March. Three proposals were chosen for further refinement, and after a second round, two were approved on 31 January 1893. After further evaluation, the ship proposed by the architect Amable Lagane, of the shipyard, on 8 November. By the time the design was finalized, weight constraints had forced Lagane to abandon water-tube boilers for fire-tube boilers, which were smaller but obsolescent. A sister ship to D'Entrecasteaux was approved on 21 August 1895, which was to have been built to the second design the had approved, and was to have been named Jeanne d'Arc. But the new naval minister, √âdouard Lockroy, cancelled the ship in early 1896 in favor of another armored cruiser without consulting the , which oversaw naval construction. Lockroy was replaced as naval minister in April 1896, and his successor, Armand Besnard, attempted to secure parliamentary approval for another D'Entrecasteaux-class cruiser, but the Chamber of Deputies refused, ending the project. D'Entrecasteaux represented an evolutionary step between the smaller armored cruiser and the larger armored cruisers that followed, beginning with . In addition, her design was used as the basis of the medium armored cruisers of the , which were also intended to serve overseas. D'Entrecasteaux nevertheless suffered from defects that curtailed her active career, most significantly design defects that hampered her seakeeping. The heavy main gun forward, coupled with the ram bow, caused her to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas. =General characteristics and machinery= Plan and profile drawing of D'Entrecasteaux D'Entrecasteaux was long between perpendiculars and long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced . Her hull had a flush deck and a pronounced ram bow, and was sheathed in teak and a copper layer to protect it from biofouling on long voyages overseas. As was typical for French warships of the period, she had a significant tumblehome shape. The ship proved to be poorly ventilated and thus very hot in service, necessitating cooling equipment in her ammunition magazines. D'Entrecasteaux was fitted with a pair of light pole masts for observation and signalling purposes. Her superstructure was fairly minimal, consisting of a small conning tower and bridge structure forward and a smaller, secondary conning position aft. Because she was intended to serve as a flagship, she was outfitted with accommodations for an admiral and his staff. Her crew numbered 559 officers and enlisted men, and a flag staff added another 28 officers and men. The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. The engines were placed side by side amidships, each in an individual engine room. Steam was provided by five coal-burning, double-ended fire-tube boilers; four were placed further forward, ducting into two funnels, and the fifth boiler was further aft, with its own funnel. The forward set of boilers was divided into two boiler rooms. The boilers proved to be troublesome in service, particularly in comparison to the water-tube boilers used in other French cruisers. Her machinery was rated to produce normally and up to on forced draft, for a top speed of . She reached a maximum speed of during sea trials in 1899. Coal storage amounted to , which allowed D'Entrecasteaux to steam for at a speed of . =Armament= Model of D'Entrecasteaux The ship was armed with a main battery of two 40-caliber (cal.) M1893 guns, which were placed in single-gun turrets, one forward and one aft on the centerline. These guns were the largest to be installed aboard a French cruiser of any type. The turrets were electrically operated, and allowed elevation of the guns to 20 degrees. Three types of shell were carried, including a cast iron projectile, along with armor-piercing and semi- armor-piercing shells, both of which weighed . The shells had a muzzle velocity of , depending on the type. These were supported by a secondary battery of twelve Model 1893 45-cal. guns, eight of which were carried in individual casemates in the main deck. The other four were in gun shield- protected pivot mounts on the upper deck. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and six 1-pounder guns. She was also armed with four torpedo tubes, two in her hull below the waterline and the other two in trainable, deck-mounted launchers. The deck tubes were placed amidships, one on each broadside, while the submerged tubes were just aft of the forward main battery gun and were in fixed positions. These were supplied with a total of twelve Model 1892 torpedoes. They carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of . She had a storage capacity for twenty naval mines, which was typical for cruisers intended to serve overseas. She had no minelaying apparatus, as the mines were only intended to be used to help defend a port, and they would have been laid by smaller boats. =Armor= Armor protection consisted of nickel steel armor. She had a curved armor deck; on the flat portion in the central part of the ship where it protected the machinery spaces, the deck was thick. It sloped downward at the sides and increased in thickness to . Toward the bow and stern, the deck was decreased slightly to on the flat and on the slopes. All of the deck armor was attached to a pair of underlying layers of thick mild steel. A second deck consisting of another double layer of 10 mm steel was above the flat portion of the main deck with a cofferdam connecting it to the main deck; this upper deck formed the roof of the secondary battery. The cofferdam was subdivided extensively to contain flooding in the event of damage. D'Entrecasteauxs conning tower was heavily armored with of nickel steel on the sides, also backed by two layers of 10 mm mild steel. The tower's roof consisted of two layers of of steel. Her semi-elliptical main battery turrets received the same level of protection on the front, but thinned at the sides and rear to with the same mild steel backing. Their supporting barbettes were above the battery deck and below. Each casemate consisted of plating with the double 10 mm backing.  Service history =French career= D'Entrecasteaux underway during sea trials in 1898 D'Entrecasteaux, named for Admiral Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, was built at the shipyard in La Seyne-sur-Mer. She was laid down in September 1894, was launched on 13 June 1896, and after completing fitting-out, began sea trials in 1898. During testing on 28 April, one of her boilers burst, scalding four stokers badly and delaying her completion by six months. The ship was completed in early 1899. She was commissioned on 15 February and was immediately deployed to the Far East to join the (Naval Division of the Far East and Western Pacific) and serve as its flagship. After departing on 6 April, she reached Saigon in French Indochina on 12 May, where she joined the protected cruisers , , and . Rear Admiral de Courejolles hoisted his flag aboard D'Entrecasteaux on 1 June and she thereafter embarked on a long voyage around East Asia, sailing as far north as China. She took part in the colonialist response to the Boxer Uprising in China in 1900, joining in the Battle of the Taku Forts in June as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance. During the bombardment, she suffered problems with her main battery guns' breech blocks and locking mechanisms. These deficiencies compelled D'Entrecasteauxs return to Toulon for repairs; she arrived there on 9 January 1901. There, her main battery guns were removed and sent to the factory in Ruelle to have new breech blocks installed; the work lasted until June. While D'Entrecasteaux was in Toulon, Rear Admiral Charles-Jesse Bayle replaced de Courejolles as the divisional commander, and he brought with him Captain Louis Dartige du Fournet as his flag captain. She then returned to East Asia, arriving in Saigon on 8 August. The ship spent the next two in the region, taking cruises in Chinese and Japanese waters in 1901 and 1902 before returning to Toulon in 1903 for a major overhaul that lasted through 1905. After emerging from the shipyard, D'Entrecasteaux sailed on 25 November 1905 for French Indochina, by way of a brief assignment to the Indian Ocean command. She then moved to the Naval Division of the Far East and Western Pacific. On 15 August, she resumed flagship duties when Rear Admiral Boisse transferred from the protected cruiser . The unit also included the armored cruisers and , the protected cruiser , four gunboats, and five destroyers. D'Entrecasteaux served on the station for the next four years, and during this period, she was involved in the unsuccessful attempt to re-float the armored cruiser on 20 May 1907, which had run aground off the coast of China. D'Entrecasteaux departed Saigon on 25 October 1909 to return to Toulon. The French Navy considered converting D'Entrecasteaux into a training ship for naval cadets following her return home in 1909 to replace the armored cruiser , but the plan came to nothing. She instead underwent an extensive overhaul that included repairs to her propulsion system and her hull. Cooling systems for her secondary battery magazines were also installed, along with improved fire-control systems, a new Barr & Stroud rangefinder, and a wireless telegraphy compartment. Her torpedo tubes were also removed, as she had never used them. The ship was recommissioned on 1 January 1912 to serve as the flagship of the Training Division of the Mediterranean Squadron, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Bertrand Sourrieu. In early 1914, the navy considered using D'Entrecasteaux to replace Pothuau as a gunnery training vessel, but the changes had not been made by the outbreak of World War I in August. World War I At the start of World War I in August 1914, D'Entrecasteaux was part of the , along with Pothuau and the old pre-dreadnought battleships and . Both of the cruisers required refits before they would be ready for active service, which were completed by the end of the month. On 5 November, France and Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire, and D'Entrecasteaux was sent to the coast of Ottoman Syria, arriving there on 29 November to join the (Syrian Division) with the armored cruiser . The two cruisers were tasked with patrolling the length of coastline between Jaffa to Alexandretta. D'Entrecasteaux was sent to Port Said at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in January 1915 to reinforce the defenses there against an impending Ottoman attack. During this period, on 31 January, French naval forces in the region were reorganized as the 3e (3rd Squadron) and D'Entrecasteaux became the flagship of now-Vice Admiral Dartige du Fournet. She and the old coastal defense ship played a critical role in defeating the Ottoman infantry in their assault on 3 February. Their gunfire broke up the advancing Ottoman columns and Requin silenced the Ottoman heavy artillery battery. D'Entrecasteaux fired a total of five 240 mm shells and thirty-six 138 mm rounds at a range of in the course of the action. The next day, Dartige du Fournet transferred to the pre-dreadnought . On 25 March, D'Entrecasteaux bombarded Ottoman positions in Gaza. In late April, fears that the Ottoman Empire was planning an attack on the Suez Canal prompted the French to send D'Entrecasteaux, the protected cruiser , and Jeanne d'Arc to Port Said to reinforce the warships supporting the land defenses of the canal. No attacks materialized, and the ships were sent to bombard Ottoman positions along the coast to force them to disperse their units rather than make attacks on the Suez Canal. Dartige du Fournet also established a set of three patrol zones to cover the Syrian coast on 6 May, and D'Entrecasteaux was assigned to the first sector, which covered the area between the Suez Canal and Tyre. The French declared a blockade of the coast on 25 June. The ship was detached for a refit in Brest late in the year. As additional forces arrived in the region, the French reorganized the squadron into two divisions, D'Entrecasteaux being assigned to the 2nd Division in November. She became the flagship of Rear Admiral Henri de Spitz, though she did not arrive on the Syrian coast until 20 December. Vice Admiral Frederic Moreau, the squadron commander by early 1916, opposed continuing patrols of the Syrian coast, as Ottoman maritime traffic had essentially stopped and he could not justify the expenditure of coal. The sinking of Amiral Charner by a German U-boat on 8 February strengthened his position, and further patrols were curtailed. D'Entrecasteaux was again detached in March for another refit. After its conclusion, the ship was assigned to the Moroccan Naval Division, but on 14 September, the protected cruiser arrived in Tangier to relieve her. D'Entrecasteaux was sent to Ethiopia with Pothuau in October in response to unrest in the country, but pressure from Britain, which feared that France was trying to assert influence in the country, led the French to withdraw the cruisers. In late 1916, Ottoman forces had made significant progress toward defeating the Arabs who had rebelled against Ottoman rule at the instigation of the British. Vice Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss requested French assistance in the form of D'Entrecasteaux and Pothuau, which the French Navy dispatched to the Red Sea to provide fire support to the beleaguered Arab forces. The two cruisers operated out of Port Suez; one was on station at either of the main Arab cities of Jeddah and Rabegh while the other replenished coal at Port Suez. On 11 February 1917, the cruisers were released from these duties, as the Arabs had secured their position and the cruisers were needed elsewhere. They were then sent to the Gulf of Aden to strengthen the vessels available for convoy escort in the Indian Ocean. They were joined there by D'Estr√©es. D'Entrecasteaux and D'Estr√©es escorted convoys from Madagascar to Djibouti through May. D'Entrecasteaux was sent home for another refit in July, her place in the area eventually being taken by the protected cruiser . =Postwar career and service in the Belgian and Polish navies= One of Ba≈Çtyks anchors preserved as a memorial in Poland D'Entrecasteaux was sent to Durazzo and Cattaro on 25 January 1919 as part of the fleet that monitored the transfer of ex-Austro-Hungarian Navy ships to the victorious Allied powers. She was later involved in the repatriation of elements of the (Army of the East) from Macedonia. On 2 July, the ship was placed in reserve at Brest and was decommissioned on 1 June 1921. She was struck from the naval register on 27 October 1922 and transferred temporarily to the Belgian Navy the following year, being towed to Zeebrugge on 24 May 1923. She was used as a depot ship for Belgian torpedo boats until early 1926, when the Belgians returned her due to significant reductions in their naval budget. The ship was towed to Cherbourg on 4 February, where she remained until 7 March 1927, when the French sold her to the Polish Navy. In the early 1920s, the Polish Navy had explored the possibility of buying a cruiser from France to strengthen the nascent Polish fleet. The naval command initially wanted a vessel that could be used as a submarine tender to support their submarines, but the early plans fell through. After the Poles purchased D'Entrecasteaux, she was renamed Kr√≥l W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV and was then towed to Gdynia. The Minister for Military Affairs, Daniel Konarzewski, renamed her Ba≈Çtyk on 17 September 1927. By that time, the ship was armed with only six of her 47 mm guns; plans in the late 1920s to rearm her with a battery of eight anti-aircraft guns to use her as a floating anti-aircraft battery came to nothing due to fears that she would be too vulnerable to air attack. The vessel was instead used as a stationary training ship in Gdynia beginning in early 1929. She became the headquarters for the naval specialists school on 1 April 1930, and during this period, she served as the flagship of Commander J√≥zef Unrug. During the German invasion of Poland that began on 1 September 1939, Ba≈Çtyk was hit by a bomb on her quarterdeck, which started a small fire. Her crew remained aboard to help defend Gdynia from German bombers before abandoning her on 11 September as she was a large target in the harbor. Her crew thereafter served ashore and saw action at the Battle of Kƒôpa Oksywska. German artillery bombarded the ship on 16‚Äì17 September, and on the 19th, German forces occupied the port and seized the ship. She was then used as a barracks ship by the Germans. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap by the Germans by around 1942.

Following the end of World War II, immigrants new to Canada who were not financially established were denied policies by insurance companies. Social healthcare coverage did not exist at the time. In 1946, Ingle‚Äôs parents, John and Muriel Ingle, founded John Ingle Insurance which offered insurance for new immigrants to Canada, an idea inspired by the family‚Äôs immigrant background and an obvious consumer need. Muriel Ingle was one of the first licensed insurance women in Ontario. In 1976, Ingle formally joined the family business. He became the president of Ingle Insurance in 1985 and purchased the business after four years as president. He ran the business until 1998, when the Ingle family‚Äôs interests in Ingle Health were sold to the investment arm of a Canadian financial institution.

Joseph Davies' father, also Joseph, had been the sexton of St Anne Soho as well. Charles Davies was educated in France, becoming an excellent French scholar. He emigrated to South Australia arriving in February 1840 aboard Branken Moor with his new wife and for several years lived in Kermode-street, North Adelaide, at the King William Road corner, where he built up a large and lucrative medical practice. He became a member of the first fully elected Legislative Council in 1857 and served until 2 February 1865, when he retired by rotation, as provided for in the 1857 Act. In 1859 he was appointed one of the Visitors to the Lunatic Asylum, was on the boards of the Adelaide Hospital and the Botanic Garden, and held other public positions. He was an enthusiastic naturalist with his own private museum. He was a chess enthusiast had strong literary tastes, and contributed regularly to the South Australian Register. Around 1864 he relinquished medical practice for sheepfarming, and bought the Mattawarangula (also spelled Mattawarangala, Mattawaralunga, Mattlawarangalla) Run in the Far North of South Australia, which he later sold to his son, Charles Willoughby Davies, and retired to Beaumont.

Any category with finite products (a \\"finite product category\\") can be thought of as a cartesian monoidal category. In any cartesian monoidal category, the terminal object is the tensor unit. Dually, a monoidal finite coproduct category with the monoidal structure given by the coproduct and unit the initial object is called a cocartesian monoidal category, and any finite coproduct category can be thought of as a cocartesian monoidal category. Cartesian categories with an internal Hom functor that is an adjoint functor to the product are called Cartesian closed categories.  Properties  Cartesian monoidal categories have a number of special and important properties, such as the existence of diagonal maps Œîx : x ‚Üí x ‚äó x and augmentations ex : x ‚Üí I for any object x. In applications to computer science we can think of Œî as \\"duplicating data\\" and e as \\"deleting data\\". These maps make any object into a comonoid. In fact, any object in a cartesian monoidal category becomes a comonoid in a unique way.  Examples  Cartesian monoidal categories: *Set, the category of sets with the singleton set serving as the unit. *Cat, the bicategory of small categories with the product category, where the category with one object and only its identity map is the unit. Cocartesian monoidal categories: *Vect, the category of vector spaces over a given field, can be made cocartesian monoidal with the \\"tensor product\\" given by the direct sum of vector spaces and the trivial vector space as unit. *Ab, the category of abelian groups, with the direct sum of abelian groups as monoidal product and the trivial group as unit. * More generally, the category R-Mod of (left) modules over a ring R (commutative or not) becomes a cocartesian monoidal category with the direct sum of modules as tensor product and the trivial module as unit. In each of these categories of modules equipped with a cocartesian monoidal structure, finite products and coproducts coincide (in the sense that the product and coproduct of finitely many objects are isomorphic). Or more formally, if f : X1 ‚àê ... ‚àê Xn ‚Üí X1 √ó ... √ó Xn is the \\"canonical\\" map from the n-ary coproduct of objects Xj to their product, for a natural number n, in the event that the map f is an isomorphism, we say that a biproduct for the objects Xj is an object X = \\\\bigoplus_{j \\\\in {1,\\\\ldots,n}} X_j isomorphic to \\\\coprod_{j\\\\in {1,\\\\ldots,n}}X_j and \\\\prod_{j\\\\in {1,\\\\ldots,n}}X_j together with maps ij : Xj ‚Üí X and pj : X ‚Üí Xj such that the pair (X, {ij}) is a coproduct diagram for the objects Xj and the pair (X, {pj}) is a product diagram for the objects Xj , and where pj ‚àò ij = idXj. If, in addition, the category in question has a zero object, so that for any objects A and B there is a unique map 0A,B : A ‚Üí 0 ‚Üí B, it often follows that pk ‚àò ij = : Œ¥ij, the Kronecker delta, where we interpret 0 and 1 as the 0 maps and identity maps of the objects Xj and Xk, respectively.

It was released on 26 September 2014. Gekij≈çban Zero premiered in North America on July 28, 2015, at the 19th Fantasia International Film Festival. Plot Aya, the most popular student of a Catholic all-girls school, suddenly shuts herself in her room. Her admirer, Kasumi Nohara, kisses her photo at midnight and suddenly disappears with her friend Michi as a witness. Her disappearance is quickly attributed to a supposed curse that affects girls who kiss the photo of the person they admire at midnight. Aya's photo is taken to the attic by Sakuya Itsuki and Risa for safekeeping, but the two alongside three other girls are enticed to kiss the photo. Except for Risa, who is later found dazed but alive, all of them are eventually found dead at a nearby river. When Michi attempts to kiss the photo, Aya stops her and reveals that she is not responsible for the curse, as the photo is not hers. They search help in Kazumi \\"Mary\\" Kusanagi, an eccentric photographer, who keeps photos inside her studio of lesbian girls who made suicide pact by drowning themselves at a lake, which is now closed down, due to the then society's intolerance towards same-sex couples. She also tells a story about a couple who was doomed when one of them refused to commit suicide, causing her to be haunted by her lover for the rest of her life. Aya then admits to Michi that she is haunted by the guilt of letting a fellow orphan of hers die in front of her. Michi decides to kiss the photo to put herself into the curse and chains herself to Aya so the latter can save her should she be in danger. However, the two are separated halfway through and Aya is knocked out by Takashi, the mentally handicapped brother of the school nun, Mayumi Aso. She is thrown into a reservoir located at the place where the lesbian couples committed their suicides. There, Aya remembers that the doppelganger is in fact her twin sister, Maya. Though she died at an early age, Maya \\"grew up\\" alongside Aya and put a curse at the photo until Aya could find her in the reservoir. Meanwhile, Michi is about to be drowned by Mayumi, who is revealed to be the one murdering the girls so as to keep Takashi's supposed involvement in Maya's death a secret, but she chooses to drown herself with Takashi when the authorities are closing in. Michi goes to the reservoir and reunites with Aya. Aya and Michi participate in the school choir celebrating their graduation. Meanwhile, Mary visits the school's headmistress and abbess, correctly deducing her as the lesbian girl who was haunted by the spirit of her lover. The headmistress reveals that to keep her lover from bothering her, she murdered Maya so the latter could accompany her, though she is distressed when the act led to more murders by Mayumi, although her brother had nothing to do with it. After the choir, Michi bids Aya goodbye before she departs for Tokyo to attend a photography college. She is about to take a photo of her, but pulls up at the last second and makes Aya promise to wait for her until she has become a proper photographer.

He commented that the best aspect of the movie is the way in which it is told. Rather than focusing solely on Michi, the movie constantly shown the story through many viewpoints other than her own, which intertwining with each other and slowly expose the truth behind the mystery in the film. He found it interesting that a large portion of the story revolves around being a lesbian in Japan not only during the modern era, but also at Meiji era. He also noted that the movie's \\"intensely creepy and atmospheric\\" tone are what builds the fear, a feat many horror films could not hope to accomplish. However, he has a mixed review for the lack of ghost killing via camera in the film, which is supposed to be one of pivotal elements in the game franchise. Nevertheless, he noted that the movie is a film very much worthy of the Fatal Frame name, and stated that \\"if you are a fan of Fatal Frame or Japanese horror in general, this is most certainly a film to watch.\\"http://kotaku.com/the-fatal-frame-movie-is-an-atmospheric- masterpiece-1646000260 See also * List of LGBT-related films directed by women References Further reading  External links * (Archive) * Gekij√¥-ban: Zero (Fatal Frame) at FilmAffinity Gekijoban Zero at Japanese Film Database Category:2014 horror films Category:2014 LGBT- related films Category:Films based on Japanese novels Category:Films directed by Mari Asato Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese horror films Category:Japanese LGBT-related films Category:Lesbian-related films Category:Live-action films based on video games Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:Japanese supernatural horror films Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:Japanese psychological horror films ","title":"Gekij≈çban Zero"},{"id":"43676386","text":"Uche Henry Agbo (born 4 December 1995) is a Nigerian professional footballer who plays as either a central defender or a defensive midfielder for Spanish club Deportivo La Coru√±a.

Wilkinson joined the faculty of the UCLA Department of Political Science as an assistant professor in 1964 and became a professor in 1975. He also serves as an editor for the Comparative Civilizations Review and the Journal of World-Systems Research. Scholarship Wilkinson redefines civilization on connectedness criterion, not cultural criterion, as \\"a city-state, cities-state, or tightly linked politico-military network of such states that are not a part of a larger such network\\", and considers civilizations as world-systems. Wilkinson introduces the idea of \\"Central Civilization\\" or \\"Central World-System\\", which he argues emerged about 1500 BC with the integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations, and then engulfed the Aegean civilization in 560 BC, Indic civilization in 1000, the New World after the Age of Discovery, and finally the Far Eastern civilizations in 1850. This idea has been followed and developed by other scholars.See, e.g., The notion that the Middle East and Europe are in the same system was also adopted by Ian Morris's award-winning book Why the West Rules‚ÄîFor Now, which defines the West as all civilizations descending from the Fertile Crescent, rather than just the traditional Western world.

She grew up in a theatrical household her father directed plays at colleges in Texas, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and she developed a strong affinity for the tragic, weary, memorable female characters of Tennessee Williams. Through her father, she was exposed to the plays of both Williams and the Russian playwright, Anton Chekhov. Their work helps account for Eatman's feel for imperiled women of a certain age. In fact, Eatman credits the theater with helping her overcome her shyness by demonstrating to her that she could create her own world through her songs....once onstage, she could manipulate the way she came across. In 1985, at the age of seventeen, Eatman relocated to New York City to attend Parsons School of Design, graduating with a BFA in illustration in 1990. While supporting herself at a series of odd jobs, she began singing at clubs in Manhattan's East Village and Lower East Side. At one of these gigs, she met Tom Lewis, an A & R rep for Oh Boy Records, an independent record company owned by singer-songwriter John Prine, who signed her to the label in 1993. Her first album, Mascara Falls, was released two years later in 1995. Heather subsequently toured the United States, opening for Prine, Billy Bragg, John Hiatt, Crash Test Dummies, Jill Sobule, Ferron, Donovan, Richie Havens, and Rosanne Cash, among others, performing at venues such as the Fillmore West in San Francisco, California and the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, and appearing on The Conan O'Brien Show on September 20 of that year.The Conan O'Brien Show (September 20, 1995). YouTube. Retrieved June 6, 2016. Reviewing a performance in 1996, Los Angeles Times pop music writer Robert Hilburn said, \\"Her set was filled with an authority and individuality of vision...Unlike so many artists who walk in the thematic footsteps of obvious models [like Lou Reed, Rickie Lee Jones, and Nick Lowe], Eatman unveils new attitudes and ironies in songs that spring from such varied symbols as the King of Rock 'n' Roll and the Statue of Liberty. Most important, there is a sizable portion of Eatman originality in her music...it will be interesting to see how she expands on that freshness.\\"  Influences and Artistic Development  In a 2002 interview with Perfect Sound Forever, Eatman described the music she grew up listening to as \\"a very strange amalgam,\\" much of which came through her parents: Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, the Mamas & the Papas, Simon & Garfunkel, classical and religious music.

As a teenager, however, she gravitated toward The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Patti Smith, Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground, and, eventually, Tom Waits and Rickie Lee Jones; she has also spoken of her deep connection to the blues, including the work of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, and Elmore James.

It records the address of Stephen before the Sanhedrin and his execution outside Acts 7:58 Jerusalem, and introduces Saul (who later became Paul the Apostle). The book containing this chapter is anonymous, but early Christian tradition uniformly affirmed that Luke composed this book as well as the Gospel of Luke.Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek and is divided into 60 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: * Codex Vaticanus (AD 325‚Äì350) * Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) * Codex Bezae (~400) * Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) * Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450) * Codex Laudianus (~550) * Papyrus 33 (~550) =Old Testament references= * : * : ; * : * : * : * : * : * : * : * : * : Psalm * : Stephen's speech (7:1‚Äì53) On the surface, Stephen's speech seemingly did match the charges against him, but the recorded words apparently are a part of a 'larger polemical discourse, building on and developing the arguments already put forward in the sermons and trial speeches of the apostles'. It can be categorized into 'rewritten Bible', \\"a selective retelling of biblical history from a particular theological standpoint\\", in similar form as Psalm 105, among others in the Bible. =Verse 16= This verse has been studied extensively by theologians because the speech of Stephen seems to contradict Genesis:http://lavistachurchofchrist.org/LVanswers/2012/11-09a.html :and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. ESV Stephen's death (7:54‚Äì60) The reaction of the audience to Stephen's speech reached a dramatic high point in verse 54 and heightened even further Stephen's description of his vision in verses 55‚Äì56. Stephen's vision of God's glory has a continuity with his speech on Abraham (7:2) and Moses (cf. ), but now extends to the open heaven (verse 56) with the figure of Jesus himself positioned 'at the right hand of God' (verse 55) denoting the highest place of honor and confirming Stephen's claim that the rejected savior is in fact God's 'Righteous One'. Stephen as 'the prototype for Christian martyrdom' dies 'calling on the name of the Lord' expecting the exalted Jesus to receive his spirit (verse 59) and then cries out 'in a loud voice' (verse 60; cf. ) for forgiveness that echoes the prayer of . =Verse 55= :But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, KJV *\\"Jesus standing on right hand of God\\": The 'standing' Jesus (rather than 'seated') 'probably indicates his rising to receive' Stephen; this phrase is a variation on .Note [d] on Acts 7:55 in NET Bible. =Verse 58= :and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. NKJV *\\"Cast him out of the city\\": This action recalls the commandment of Leviticus 24:14, 23: :Take the blasphemer outside the camp ... and they took the blasphemer outside the camp, and stoned him to death.Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Acts 7, accessed 29 November 2018 =Verse 59= :And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, \\"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\\" NKJV The Pulpit Commentary notes Stephen's words in Acts 7:59 as a 'striking acknowledgment of the divinity of Christ: only he who gave the spirit could receive it back again'.Pulpit Commentary on Acts 7, accessed 14 August 2015 =Verse 60= :Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, \\"Lord, do not charge them with this sin.\\" And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

Cork County Gaol was a former prison located in Cork City, Ireland. The main walls and gate entrance of the prison are today incorporated in the perimeter of University College Cork. History The main Cork County Gaol buildings were erected in the years 1818-23, earlier buildings had been on the site in the 1790s.http://www.ucc.ie/en/about/history/places/ The 19th Century building was designed and built by the brothers James and George Pain. Description The Gaol was designed in the Greek Revival style, with a monumental Doric entrance portico. Inside there was a central building with radiating cell-block wings, a governor‚Äôs house, a chapel and a series of other buildings and yards, including homes for the families of some prison officials. County Gaol When the prison opened in the 1820s it housed both male and female prisoners, whose crimes were committed within the County boundary but outside the Cork City boundary (anyone committing a crime in the city was committed to the City Gaol, across the river at Sunday's Well. =Nineteenth Century= During the first half of the nineteenth century the County Gaol also served as a temporary prison for convicts who had been sentenced to be transported to Australia. The County Gaol was the scene of executions by hanging, which took place in public outside the Gaol until the 1860s. Queen's College Cork (now University College Cork) was built next to the Gaol in the 1840s. Bodies of hanged prisoners were used as cadavers in the college's medical school. Men's Gaol (City and County) The 1878 General Prisons (Ireland) Act reorganised the prisons in Cork. The Cork County Gaol became a Men‚Äôs Gaol (for Cork City and Cork County) and the Cork City Gaol in Sunday's Well became the women‚Äôs Gaol (for Cork City and Cork County). On the day the change came into effect female prisoners were marched out of the Western Road and over to the Sunday's Well prison, while the men were marched in the opposite direction. http://corkcitygaol.com/about/history/ =Nineteenth Century= During the Parnell Commission in 1888/1889 one of the facts entered into evidence against Tim Healy was the fact that he had \\"visited certain persons\\" in Cork prison.

Irish War of Independence Memorial to Se√°n Allen in Tipperary Town, executed in Cork County Gaol on 28 February 1921. During the Irish War of Independence (1919-22), the Gaol was used to hold republican prisoners. On 17 October 1920 Volunteer Mick Fitzgerald died on Hunger Strike at Cork Gaol. On 25 October 1920 Volunteer Joe Murphy died on Hunger Strike at Cork Gaol. On Tuesday 1 February 1921 Volunteer Cornelius Murphy was executed by firing squad at the Gaol. On Monday 28 February 1921, six prisoners were executed by firing squad: \\"On 28 January 1921 the 6th Battalion, Cork No.1 Brigade were preparing an ambush in Dripsey, Co. Cork when they were surrounded by soldiers of the 1st Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, most were taken prisoner [the Battalion Adjutant James Barrett was fatally wounded and died three weeks later]. After a military trial on the morning of 28th February 1921 six of the IRA prisoners were executed by firing squad in Cork. The six Volunteers executed were Patrick Mahoney, Timothy McCarthy, John Lyons, Daniel Callaghan, Thomas O'Brien and John Allen. That evening between 18.30 and 20.00 the IRA retaliated and shot 12 British soldiers on the streets of Cork. The first to be shot was Private Wyse who was shot by two men, shortly afterwards Corporal Hodnett was shot four times in a nearby street.\\" The shootings of the 6th Battalion Volunteers were the last War of Independence executions carried out at the Gaol and in the months that followed Republican prisoners would be executed at Victoria Barracks. Civil War Republican (anti-treaty) prisoners were held in the Gaol during and after the Irish Civil War (1922-23). On 25 September 1922, a Republican prisoner, Volunteer Patrick Mangan (a veteran of the War of Independence from Lismore), was shot by a sentry as he tried to escape from Cork County Gaol. At 08:00 on 13 March 1923, the Free State Government executed a Republican prisoner named William Healy (born in Lackabawn, Donoughmore in 1900) at Cork County Gaol. On the evening before he faced the firing squad he wrote to his father telling him, \\"If I had told on one of the boys, I would not be executed but, as you know, I would not have it said that there was a spy in our family, because as you know I was out for a Republic and I sincerely hope it will be got some day,\\"http://www.independent.ie/regionals/corkman/news/the-last-man-to-be- executed-at-cork-gaol- honoured-29290339.htmlhttp://booleweb.ucc.ie/index.php?pageID=279 Some of those executed in Cork County Gaol are buried in the former exercise yard and their graves are marked by a carved stone memorial erected by their former comrades (it was unveiled in 1948). Other patriots of that time, buried elsewhere, are also remembered on this memorial and on the Gaol fa√ßade (nearby on Gaol Walk). Later Use On 3 August 1940 John Joe Kavanagh attempted to dig a tunnel into the prison so his IRA comrades inside could escape. He was spotted by a sentry and shot dead. There is a plaque erected to his memory at the old Gaol Gates. Decline By the late 1940s the Gaol was in poor condition and being used to detain only boys. The southern part of the prison site was transferred to the ownership of U.C.C. in 1947 (this was the area on which the University built the Electrical Engineering Building in 1954). Closure and Demolition The Gaol was finally closed and the remainder transferred to UCC in 1957. UCC demolished the remaining buildings except for the Greek Revival facade and parts of the boundary wall (the chapel was kept for a while for use by the Department of Biochemistry).

Armaniidae has been suggested by several authors to belong to the family Formicidae as one of the stem-group subfamilies, Armaniinae; however, this position has was not taken up by myrmecologists. The family contained seven described genera and thirteen described species. An analysis of fossil ants based on antenna structure in 2017 resulted in three of the family being broken up with some genera being moved to Sphecomyrminae and other genera being relegated to incertae sedis in Formicidae or Aculeata. History and classification Armaniidae was sometimes treated as the most basal of the Formicidae subfamilies, and classed as a stem-group which is more distant in relation to modern ants than the next stem group, Sphecomyrminae. More often the group, treated as \\"ant-like wasps\\", was elevated to the rank of family, and considered as a possible sister group to Formicidae. It has been suggested by Engel and Grimaldi that the group may be paraphyletic. This position is in contrast to the original hypothesis of Russian paleoentomologist Gennady Dlussky, who first described the family. Dlussky considered the group, when erected in 1983, have been an intermediate family bridging the families Scoliidae and the true formicids. In contrast to both the treatment as a separate family and as a distinct subfamily, entomologist E. O. Wilson, in a 1987 paper, suggested that the then known armaniids and Sphecomyrma represented a single species. Wilson, in synonymizing the groups, made the hypothesis that the different described genera were actually fossils of different castes of the same species, with Sphecomyrma freyi being workers, Armania robusta being queens, and \\"Paleomyrmex\\" zherichini as the winged males. This view was rejected as new fossils and species were described. The group is known exclusively from impression fossils, which have a limited preservation quality, leading to the uncertainty of what features are present in the described species. Overall armaniids have a poorly developed petiole which is broadly attached to the thorax, short scapes on the antennae, and queen-like looking females. The mandibles are vespid like, with possibly only one or two teeth, though this may be an artifact of preservation. The short scape is a feature that is also seen in Sphecomyrminae members, and does not exclude armaniids from Formicidae. Similarly the petiole is a feature that is seen in both the true formicids, and in the extinct chrysidoid wasp family Falsiformicidae, which is not related to formicids at all. The two defining features of the true formicids are considered to be the presence of females which are divided into adult workers and queens. Currently no worker like armaniid specimens are known for the described species. The presence of metapleural glands in some fossils has been reported by Dlussky, but the veracity of the presence is uncertain. A review of the Cretaceous ant groups was performed by Borysenko in 2017 leading to the breakup of Armaniidae, with the three genera Armania, Orapia, and Pseudarmania being moved to Sphecomyrminae. The genera Archaeopone and Poneropterus were considered as incertae sedis in Formicidae, and the genera Dolichomyrma and Khetania were removed from the family entirely as incertae sedis in Aculeata.

At the time, together with its associated All-Scotland Crusade, led by Dr Billy Graham, it generated considerable energies, publicity and controversy. In 1964 Tell Scotland became a founding part of the Scottish Churches Council, within the ecumenical movement. Commentators since have had varied views about the extents to which Tell Scotland succeeded or failed.P. T. Bisset, \\"Tell Scotland (1952-1965)\\" in ; Frank D. Bardgett (2008) \\"The Tell Scotland Movement: failure and success\\" in Records of the Scottish Church History Society vol. XXXVIII, pp.105-149. Background The Union in 1929 of the established Church in Scotland with the United Free Church of Scotland to create the Church of Scotland was viewed as an opportunity to reach what were called ‚Äúthe churchless million‚Äù by a more effective and efficient system of parishes. The Call to the ChurchThe Call to the Church: The Book of the Forward Movement of the Church of Scotland Edinburgh: The Church of Scotland Offices 1931. of the Forward Movement of 1930-31, however, struggled for attention during the Great Depression.S.J. Brown, \\"Forward Movement, Scottish\\" in Rev. George MacLeod argued during the inter-war years \\"Are not the churchless million partly the Church's fault\\"MacLeod, George F. (1936) Are Not The Churchless Million Partly The Church's Fault? Edinburgh: The Church of Scotland Publication Committee, a pamphlet reprinting three articles previously published in Life & Work January 1936, pp.5-7, February 1936, pp.51-53 and March 1936, pp.94-97. and sought to address this by better connections between congregations and their immediate areas, by organizing ministers in teams, and by demonstrating concern for wider society. A \\"mission of friendship\\" in his Govan Old Parish Church brought in impressive numbers of new worshippers. The Iona Community was born out of MacLeod's pastoral experience and missionary concerns. 1937-39 saw the Scottish churches collaborate in their own version of the \\"Recall to Religion\\" first promoted by archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang who commended the way the \\"Recall\\" was taken up in Scotland. accessed via news.google.com, 04.09.14. George MacLeod was one of twelve Ministerial Evangelists acknowledged by the General Assembly of 1938 to support the Recall.Bardgett, Frank (2010) Scotland's Evangelist D.P. Thomson. Haddington: The Handsel Press pp.152-157, 159. By 1939 it was possible to speak of a socially-aware \\"new evangelism\\" being practiced: \\"The development has been away from the large meeting and toward more intensive work among people in their homes and places of work,\\" and on a more cooperative basis between denominations.Secretariat for Evangelism (1954) Ecumenical Studies: Evangelism in Scotland Geneva: The World Council of Churches p.31. This emphasis on congregationally-centred outreach, enabling the mission of the laity, was affirmed during the Second World War by the \\"Baillie Commission\\", the Church of Scotland's General Assembly's \\"Commission for the Interpretation of God's Will in the Present Crisis,\\" convened by the Very Rev. Prof. John Baillie, which reported to the Assembly 1941 to 1945.John Baillie, 'Preface' (1945) God's Will for Church and Nation London: SCM Press, pp.7-8;Secretariat for Evangelism (1954) Ecumenical Studies: Evangelism in Scotland Geneva: The World Council of Churches p.55. Immediate Origins During, and in the years immediately after the Second World War, as Leader of the Iona Community George MacLeod led a series of parish missions and supported the creation of new congregations in post-war housing schemes through the Church Extension movement. George F. MacLeod (1952) A Message of Friendship: the principles of a parish mission Glasgow: The Iona Community; Secretariat for Evangelism Ecumenical Studies: Evangelism in Scotland Geneva: The World Council of Churches pp.38-39. On behalf of the Home Board of the Church of Scotland, D.P. Thomson led a series of visitation evangelism campaigns; that in 1947 in North Kelvinside, the parish of Rev. Tom Allan was widely publicized, while the \\"Mid-Century Campaign\\" in Paisley, unusually, lasted an entire year, March 1950 to April 1951. Bardgett, Frank, (2010) Scotland's Evangelist, D.P. Thomson Haddington: The Handsel Press, pp.236-253. Other major evangelistic campaigns organized in Scotland in this period were the \\"Commando Campaigns\\" in both Edinburgh and Glasgow of 1950, Roberts, Colin A. (ed.) (1945) These Christian Commando Campaigns London: The Epworth Press describes the origin of this style of campaign in post-war England. and the \\"Radio Missions\\" organized by BBC Scotland in 1950 and 1952. Principles and Organization Developing directly from planning for a third Radio Mission, the Tell Scotland Movement came under the direction of a committee supported by the Baptist Union of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, the Churches of Christ in Scotland, the Congregational Union of Scotland, the Methodist Synod in Scotland, the Iona Community, the Scottish Episcopal Church, the United Free Church of Scotland, and the United Original Secession denomination.Small, Mabel (1975) Growing Together: Some Aspects of the Ecumenical Movement in Scotland 1924-64 Dunblane: Scottish Council of Churches, (limited circulation) covers the institutional history of Tell Scotland. Direction Direction of the Movement came from a larger Parent Committee, with a smaller executive meeting as the Steering Panel. Rev. William A. Smellie, convener of the Church of Scotland's Home Board, chaired both Tell Scotland groups. Ronnie Falconer of BBC Scotland was secretary of the Steering Panel; other executive members were David Read (chaplain of Edinburgh University), Charles Duthie (Principal of the Scottish Congregational College), Edward Campbell of the Baptist Union, Charles Anderson of the Episcopal Church, Elizabeth Wardlaw of the United Free Church, Horace Walker and Roddie Smith of the Church of Scotland, and Ralph Morton, Deputy Leader of the Iona Community. Rev. Tom Allan was appointed full-time Field Organizer. Motivation At a press conference to launch the Movement in 1953, the Movement explained its motivation: \\"Mission must be the constant activity of the Church in love and obedience to her Lord. The urgency of the Church's missionary task is being brought home to us in several ways: (i) We are recognising the inadequacy of traditional methods of evangelism. (ii) We are conscious of the apparent failure of the conventional life of the Church to respond in compassion to the needs of the world. (iii) We are convinced that the only word for a bankrupt world is the Word of the Church's Lord.\\"Bardgett, Frank, (2010) Scotland's Evangelist, D.P. Thomson Haddington: The Handsel Press, p.299; Small M. (1964) Growing Together: The Ecumenical Movement in Scotland 1924-64 Dunblane: Scottish Council of Churches, limited circulation. Principles Three general principles were agreed to underpin the Movement: (1) \\"The key to evangelism lay with the parish or local congregation. Mission was not something added to the Church's life but was one part of the Church's witness. (2) Effective mission was not an occasional or sporadic effort but was a continuous pattern of life within the local Church. (3) Whatever the method of mission, the layman had a vital and strategic part to play.\\"Frank D. Bardgett (2008) \\"The Tell Scotland Movement: failure and success\\" in Records of the Scottish Church History Society vol. XXXVIII, pp.116-117, quoting from an address by Tom Allan. Planning Three phases were planned: (1) Motivation (mission to ministers and office-bearers) September 1953 to June 1954; (2) Recruitment and training of the laity (mission to congregations) September 1954 to June 1955; (3) Outgoing mission to the community, beginning September 1955. No end date was set, as Tell Scotland was conceived as an ongoing movement, not a one-off campaign.Bardgett, Frank, (2010) Scotland's Evangelist, D.P. Thomson Haddington: The Handsel Press, p.299. Tom Allan explained the central part expected to be played by congregations in his pamphlets: The Agent of Mission and The Congregational Group in Action,Allan, Tom (1954) The Agent of Mission: the lay group in evangelism, its significance and its tasks Glasgow: Tell Scotland; Allan, Tom (1955) The Congregational Group in Action.Glasgow: Tell Scotland. and he recommended to the Movement James Maitland's Iona Community pamphlet, Caring for People with its call to care for \\"the aged and infirm, the sick, the destitute; the involvement with the critical political issues of the times\\".Frank D. Bardgett (2008) \\"The Tell Scotland Movement: failure and success\\" in Records of the Scottish Church History Society vol. XXXVIII, p.133. The All-Scotland Crusade The success of Dr Billy Graham's 1954 crusade in Harringay, London, then brought demands, unexpected when Tell Scotland began, that an invitation be issued to him to lead a campaign in Scotland.Shannon, Bill (2000) Tom Allan in a Nutshell The Handsel Press,p.11. . Despite the opposition of George MacLeod, the Movement's Parent Committee itself invited Graham to lead a campaign in Glasgow in spring 1955, to be extended to the whole country as an \\"All-Scotland Crusade\\" by the telephone relay system. Tom Allan justified the addition of the Crusade to phase two of Tell Scotland, and the commitment of the Movement to cooperate with the Crusade, by suggesting that such a series of rallies would better prepare congregations for their phase three task of outreach.Shannon, Bill (2000) Tom Allan in a Nutshell The Handsel Press,p.12. . George MacLeod, to the contrary, feared that a traditional rally-based professional Crusade would fatally undermine the congregational emphasis of Tell Scotland.Ferguson, Ronald (1990). George MacLeod. London: William Collins Sons & Co. pp. 270-275. . With Tom Allan as Chairman of its Executive Committee, the All Scotland Crusade, sponsored by Tell Scotland in cooperation with the Billy Graham Organization, was held during March and April 1955. Large numbers of people attended Billy Graham's sermons in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall and watched the BBC's broadcasts from the Crusade. Initial reports were highly positive: Tom Allan claimed that \\"a total of 1,185,360 people in Scotland attended meetings of one kind or another.\\"Allan, Tom (ed.) (1955) Crusade in Scotland ... Billy Graham London: Pickering & Inglis p.8. The Outgoing Movement Congregations across Scotland took up the challenge of the third, out-going, phase of Tell Scotland. By summer 1956, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland heard that \\"There is hardly a part of Scotland where there has been no evangelistic activity ... some 600 campaigns of house to house visitation have been carried through\\".\\"Report of the Home Board\\" in Reports to the General Assembly 1956 Edinburgh: The Church of Scotland p.233. These were often arranged on an inter-denominational basis.Frank D. Bardgett (2008) \\"The Tell Scotland Movement: failure and success\\" in Records of the Scottish Church History Society vol. XXXVIII, pp.129-130. After a citywide visitation of Edinburgh, 1955‚Äì56, the Church of Scotland Presbytery concluded that \\"The year of parochial evangelism shows many more people added to the Church than the year of mass evangelism\\".Bardgett, Frank, (2010) Scotland's Evangelist, D.P. Thomson Haddington: The Handsel Press, p322. At the invitation of local presbyteries and congregations, D.P. Thomson led campaigns under the Tell Scotland brand in Sutherland (1955), Mull, Ross-shire and Orkney (1956) and Shetland (1957). In 1958 he cooperated with Tom Allan in the Glasgow Central Churches Campaign.Bardgett, Frank, (2010) Scotland's Evangelist, D.P. Thomson Haddington: The Handsel Press, pp.320-334. Rev. Tom Allan had resigned as the Movement's Field Organiser in the autumn of 1955 and accepted a call to the Glasgow city-centre parish of St George's-Tron Church.Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae, Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd (vols. 1-9); also Saint Andrew Press (vol. 10) summarizes Allan's career in the Church of Scotland in vol.9 p.284 and vol. 10 p.175. The Final Phase A second chapter of Tell Scotland's life ran from 1957 to 1966, during which the Movement supported two branches of work. Under Allan's successor, Rev. Ian Mactaggart, Field Organiser 1955-1960, further parish missions were encouraged. In addition Rev. Colin Day was appointed to lead a series of national \\"Kirk Week\\" events, large-scale conferences to encourage the laity to think through the implications of their faith for the worlds of home and work.Small M. (1964) Growing Together: The Ecumenical Movement in Scotland 1924-64 Dunblane: Scottish Council of Churches pp.77, 92, 114-130; Highet, John (1960). The Scottish Churches. London: Skeffington & Son. pp. 126-127. In 1957, an administrative reorganisation created a governing Committee with an Executive and four Commissions: on Evangelism, on the Bible, on the Community and on the Laity. These published study pamphlets. When Mactaggart left office, a 50-strong Panel of \\"Missioners\\" held discussions but were unable to agree any new national mission or project.Small M. (1964) Growing Together: The Ecumenical Movement in Scotland 1924-64 Dunblane: Scottish Council of Churches pp.88-106. By 1961 widespread disappointment with the Movement was being reported. In 1964 the Movement's structures became the Department of Mission of the new Scottish Council of Churches and the name was dropped in 1966.D.B.

An appraisal of effect\\". Statistics show that Church of Scotland church membership peaked in 1956 and then dropped off in the years following. * In 1966 D.P. Thomson concluded that visitation evangelism was more likely than mass or crusade evangelism to have enduring results.Thomson, D.P. (1966) Dr. Billy Graham and the pattern of modern evangelism Crieff: The Book Department, St Ninian's, p.40-41. * In 1978 Ronnie Falconer considered that \\"Billy's message was not really in touch with modern society\\" and that the Crusade's high visibility encouraged too many to say \\"Leave it all to Graham\\", avoiding the demands of local mission. * In 1984 Rev. Prof. James Whyte regretted the intrusion of the Crusade, considering that it prevented congregationally-based outreach from developing.James Whyte \\"Foreword\\" in Allan, Tom The Face of My Parish Glasgow: Loudoun Publications Ltd (1984 ed.) p.6, citing a Report to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. * In 1986-7 Peter Bisset considered Tell Scotland as a whole \\"The most important movement of mission that Scotland had seen in the course of the century\\" and \\"A movement of mission scarcely paralleled in the record of the years\\".Bisset, P.

Bebbington, writing more generally of the UK, concluded that \\"Billy Graham was reaching extensively beyond the middle classes\\" and that \\"he administered a powerful tonic\\". * In 1990 Ron Ferguson considered that the invitation to invite Billy Graham fatally divided the leadership of the Movement, draining its energies.Ferguson, Ronald (1990).

Brown acknowledged that the numbers attending Tell Scotland-type events were vast and that they \\"had a powerful resonance to 1950s Britain\\". He argued that broader social trends resulted in \\"cultural traditionalism\\" crumbling in Britain in the 1960s. * In 2008 Frank Bardgett suggested that inward looking congregations, ministerial inability to facilitate lay outreach, and the theological ignorance of the laity all hampered those interested either by the Crusade or by visitation evangelism from long-term integration with congregations.Frank D.

The epicenter of the earthquake was near the West Napa Fault, a previously unmarked fault. Damage Several unreinforced masonry buildings in downtown Napa suffered exterior damage as a result of the earthquake. Sixteen buildings were red tagged following the event and one hundred sixty eight were yellow tagged. Although the magnitude of the primary event was considered only moderate, shaking was intensified in the City of Napa and surrounding area due to the sedimentary soil on the floor of the valley. The earthquake caused an interruption of power to approximately 10,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers. Several hundred houses suffered toppled or cracked chimneys and several instances of broken plumbing due to toppled water heaters were reported.

From 1900-1902 he became a pupil of Archip Kuindzhi in St. Petersburg, and from 1902-1904 he attended the studio of the Hungarian Professor Simon Hollocy. In 1906 he studied at the Julian Academy in Paris and with Philip Colarossi. His first paintings were exhibited in 1900 at the St. Petersburg Academy Exhibition. Since 1915 he was a member of the \\"Peredvizhniki\\" Travelling Exhibition. During the years 1906-1916 he won the \\"Kuindzhi Prize\\" six times, and the Stroganov Prize for his painting \\"Breakers\\" which drew much attention at the International Exhibition in Munich 1913. A number of his pictures were bought by the Russian government: i.e. \\"Moonlight\\",\\"the Swans\\", \\"Spring Night\\",\\"Autumn Wood\\", (Russian Gallery Leningrad). Since 1920 Kaigorodov lived and worked in Tallinn, Estonia, becoming a member of the Art Society K.T.E.U. and here he also directed his private Arts School. He both sent his pictures to, and held exhibitions in, Germany (Glaspalast Munich), Berlin and Karlsruhe, the Netherlands (Den Haag) and England (London). His painting \\"Seashore\\", acquired by the Carnegie Institute (U.S.A.) gained him the Carnegie Medal in 1939. From 1939 Kaigorodov lived in Gdansk and Poznan and mounted several private exhibitions. He visited Prague three times during the Second World War, painting a series of pictures of the old city. Kaigorodov died on 18 July 1945 in Mondsee, Salzkammergut in Austria. His pictures may also be found in the Tretyakov Gallery (Moscow), the Russian gallery (St. Petersburg), the Art Museum of Estonia (Tallinn), the Slav Institute (Prague) and the Belgrade Gallery. Several dozens of his paintings were left behind in Poznan in January 1945 and these occasionally surface on the international art market. Kagorodov was mainly a landscape painter within the Russian tradition, but he also produced a number of genre paintings and portraits. He specialized in seascapes and depictions of water and clouds were his particular element. As a medium he preferred tempera which he used to very great effect.Thieme-Becker Kuenstlerlexikon; Internet auction entries References Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:Russian artists Category:1878 births Category:1945 deaths ","title":"Anatoly Kaigorodov"},{"id":"43676908","text":"George Anthony (born George Anthony Ganetakos; August 26, 1940) is an award- winning Canadian entertainment journalist, biographer and television executive.

Jetta has stated that \\"The most important thing that data is used for is to determine which products consumers prefer, and to make sure what's on the shelf is what they want to buy...For example, we're doing one project for a retail chain where we found that in areas with high African-American populations, not only do they buy African- American hair care products and cosmetics specifically, but they buy grooming products in general at a very high level. With that kind of information, the retailer can make sure all those products are stocked and available for them.\\" In early 2016, Jetta criticized the consumer packaged goods industry for stalling their own growth.

The group moved down to Lagos where they gained popularity and with the inclusion of new member Faze at the time it was a formidable team. It didn't take long before a chance meeting with Tony Tetuila another Nigerian ex member of The Remedies led to further exposure of the group and eventual release of their first album as Plantashun Boiz in the year 2000.

The fine lines of Sea Sovereign's posture, along with his light-bay coloring, resulted in the horse appearing in the 1949 Shirley Temple film to portray his sire, The Story of Seabiscuit. Background Sea Sovereign was foaled in 1942, sired by Seabiscuit, who was born on May 23, 1933, in Lexington, Kentucky, and was among the most famous race horses of the century.Laura Hillebrand, Seabiscuit. Both horses were in a line of pedigree descended from Man o' War. Seabiscuit had been mated over one hundred times successfully, though none of his foals turned out to be extraordinary runners. Sea Sovereign's mother was Queen Helen by Light Brigade. One account of Seabiscuit's life is depicted in a Shirley Temple film from 1949 titled The Story of Seabiscuit, though it was Sea Sovereign who portrayed Seabiscuit. The film also included archival racetrack footage which showed the actual Seabiscuit racing in competition. Sea Sovereign was also the great-grandson of Man o' War (who appeared in a separate, 1925 film titled Kentucky Pride). Racing career Sea Sovereign had a very moderate and very brief career as a racehorse. He made eight starts with three firsts and $34,070 in earnings. The most notable win came in the Santa Catalina Handicap in 1945. Stud career Very little is known of the subsequent career of Sea Sovereign, and the principal interest in the horse after a moderately successfully racing career appears to be as part of the study of the stud career of Seabiscuit.

History In 1806 an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the building of a new Cork City Gaol to replace the old gaol at the Northgate Bridge (the old gaol, which was nearly 100 years old, was on a confined site and was overcrowded and unhygienic). The first site chosen for the new prison was at distillery fields, but this site was later deemed to be unsuitable because it was prone to flooding. A site on Sunday's Well was eventually chosen, its altitude being seen as an advantage for containing \\"gaol fever\\" (typhus). The site, its approach roads and perimeters was commenced in 1816 and the building of the prison proper started in 1818. The building was designed by William Robertson of Kilkenny and built by the Deane family. The famous sculptor, John Hogan worked on the building as a draughtsman. Description The new Cork City Gaol opened in 1824 and was reported as being \\"the finest in 3 kingdoms\\". In 1870 the west wing was remodelled into a double-sided cell wing. Gaol gatehouse City gaol When the prison opened in the 1820s it housed both male and female prisoners, whose crimes were committed within the city boundary. Anyone committing a crime outside that boundary were committed to the County Gaol, across the river from the City Gaol near University College Cork. =Nineteenth century= The Fenian Brian Dillon was remanded at Cork City Gaol when he was arrested in September 1865. Women's gaol (city and county) The 1878 General Prisons (Ireland) Act reorganised the prisons in Cork. The Cork City Gaol became a women's gaol (for Cork City and Cork County) and the Cork County Gaol near UCC became the men's gaol (for Cork City and Cork County). On the day the change came into effect, male prisoners were marched out of the Sunday's Well Prison and over to the Western Road Gaol, while the women were marched in the opposite direction. =Nineteenth century= Many of the prisoners in the late 19th century were repeat offenders locked up for what would not today be imprisonable offences; for example, a woman named Mary Tucker from Rathmore in County Cork was imprisoned at least three times between 1849 and 1908, sometimes for offences such as 'Obscene Language' or 'Drunkenness'. =Twentieth century= During the Irish War of Independence Republican women prisoners were imprisoned in the gaol. In October 1919, Constance Markievicz, the first woman to be elected to the British Parliament, was imprisoned at Cork Gaol for making a seditious speech. In January 1919, another member of Cumann na mBan, Mary Bowles, was imprisoned for arms offences. Later that month a Republican prisoner named Dolly Burke escaped from the prison. Civil War In 1922 and 1923, the prison was opened to male and female Republican (anti-treaty) prisoners of the Irish Civil War. One of those imprisoned at the time was the writer Frank O'Connor. A spectacular escape was made from the gaol in November 1923. The escapees were high-value prisoners who had been sent to the gaol as it was \\"the safest place to hold them\\". Some men had feigned illness on the night preceding the escape. A rope ladder was made to scale the outer wall, and bed clothes were used to descend to the ground by night. After the prisoners had lowered themselves to the ground inside the wall, they had to huddle in its shadow in sight of a sentry. The position of the moon at a certain hour had to be estimated in order to conceal the movements of the men in the shadows. They went in batches of fourteen as that was the number that could fit in the shadow of the wall, the most wanted men being given preference in order of the serious nature of their charges. All the men in the first batch were liable to the death penalty and cast lots for the order in line. When number nine went over the wall some noise attracted the sentry, and he made movements which caused the prisoner to balk. After a few moments silence, the action was resumed, and three batches amounting to forty two men, escaped with a lapse of fifteen minutes between each batch. It was a frosty night and they had to travel in stockinged feet. Some of those who escaped were natives of Cork City and got clear of there before daylight, but others in the last few batches were recaptured later in the day. The gaol closed in August 1923, with all remaining prisoners either released or transferred to other prisons. Post 1923 From 1927 the top floor of the Governors house was used as a radio broadcasting station by 6CK, the first official radio station in Cork, Ireland. 6CK was succeeded by a national radio station ‚Äì Radio √âireann (now Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann), and broadcasting continued at the gaol until the 1950s. Apart from the radio broadcasting and some storage use of the exterior grounds by the Dept, Posts & Telegraphs, the gaol complex was allowed to become totally derelict. Museum The building reopened to the public as a visitor attraction in 1993.

These flows of probability measures can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depends on the distributions of the current random states. A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample a large number of copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods these mean-field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean-field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes. In other words, starting with a chaotic configuration based on independent copies of initial state of the nonlinear Markov chain model, the chaos propagates at any time horizon as the size the system tends to infinity; that is, finite blocks of particles reduces to independent copies of the nonlinear Markov process. This result is called the propagation of chaos property. The terminology \\"propagation of chaos\\" originated with the work of Mark Kac in 1976 on a colliding mean-field kinetic gas model. History The theory of mean-field interacting particle models had certainly started by the mid-1960s, with the work of Henry P. McKean Jr. on Markov interpretations of a class of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising in fluid mechanics. The mathematical foundations of these classes of models were developed from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s by several mathematicians, including Werner Braun, Klaus Hepp, Karl Oelschl√§ger, G√©rard Ben Arous and Marc Brunaud, Donald Dawson, Jean Vaillancourt and J√ºrgen G√§rtner, Christian L√©onard, Sylvie M√©l√©ard, Sylvie Roelly, Alain-Sol Sznitman and Hiroshi Tanaka for diffusion type models; F. Alberto Gr√ºnbaum, Tokuzo Shiga, Hiroshi Tanaka, Sylvie M√©l√©ard and Carl Graham for general classes of interacting jump-diffusion processes. We also quote an earlier pioneering article by Theodore E. Harris and Herman Kahn, published in 1951, using mean-field but heuristic-like genetic methods for estimating particle transmission energies. Mean-field genetic type particle methods are also used as heuristic natural search algorithms (a.k.a. metaheuristic) in evolutionary computing. The origins of these mean-field computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the work of Alan Turing on genetic type mutation-selection learning machines and the articles by Nils Aall Barricelli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. The Australian geneticist Alex Fraser also published in 1957 a series of papers on the genetic type simulation of artificial selection of organisms. Quantum Monte Carlo, and more specifically Diffusion Monte Carlo methods can also be interpreted as a mean-field particle approximation of Feynman-Kac path integrals. The origins of Quantum Monte Carlo methods are often attributed to Enrico Fermi and Robert Richtmyer who developed in 1948 a mean field particle interpretation of neutron-chain reactions, but the first heuristic-like and genetic type particle algorithm (a.k.a. Resampled or Reconfiguration Monte Carlo methods) for estimating ground state energies of quantum systems (in reduced matrix models) is due to Jack H. Hetherington in 1984 In molecular chemistry, the use of genetic heuristic-like particle methods (a.k.a. pruning and enrichment strategies) can be traced back to 1955 with the seminal work of Marshall. N. Rosenbluth and Arianna. W. Rosenbluth. The first pioneering articles on the applications of these heuristic-like particle methods in nonlinear filtering problems were the independent studies of Neil Gordon, David Salmon and Adrian Smith (bootstrap filter), Genshiro Kitagawa (Monte Carlo filter) , and the one by Himilcon Carvalho, Pierre Del Moral, Andr√© Monin and G√©rard Salut published in the 1990s. The term interacting \\"particle filters\\" was first coined in 1996 by Del Moral. Particle filters were also developed in signal processing in the early 1989-1992 by P. Del Moral, J.C. Noyer, G. Rigal, and G. Salut in the LAAS-CNRS in a series of restricted and classified research reports with STCAN (Service Technique des Constructions et Armes Navales), the IT company DIGILOG, and the LAAS-CNRS (the Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems) on RADAR/SONAR and GPS signal processing problems.P.

The foundations and the first rigorous analysis on the convergence of genetic type models and mean field Feynman-Kac particle methods are due to Pierre Del Moral in 1996. Branching type particle methods with varying population sizes were also developed in the end of the 1990s by Dan Crisan, Jessica Gaines and Terry Lyons, and by Dan Crisan, Pierre Del Moral and Terry Lyons. The first uniform convergence results with respect to the time parameter for mean field particle models were developed in the end of the 1990s by Pierre Del Moral and Alice Guionnet for interacting jump type processes, and by Florent Malrieu for nonlinear diffusion type processes. New classes of mean field particle simulation techniques for Feynman-Kac path- integration problems includes genealogical tree based models, backward particle models, adaptive mean field particle models, island type particle models, and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods Applications In physics, and more particularly in statistical mechanics, these nonlinear evolution equations are often used to describe the statistical behavior of microscopic interacting particles in a fluid or in some condensed matter. In this context, the random evolution of a virtual fluid or a gas particle is represented by McKean-Vlasov diffusion processes, reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems, or Boltzmann type collision processes. As its name indicates, the mean field particle model represents the collective behavior of microscopic particles weakly interacting with their occupation measures. The macroscopic behavior of these many-body particle systems is encapsulated in the limiting model obtained when the size of the population tends to infinity. Boltzmann equations represent the macroscopic evolution of colliding particles in rarefied gases, while McKean Vlasov diffusions represent the macroscopic behavior of fluid particles and granular gases. In computational physics and more specifically in quantum mechanics, the ground state energies of quantum systems is associated with the top of the spectrum of Schr√∂dinger's operators. The Schr√∂dinger equation is the quantum mechanics version of the Newton's second law of motion of classical mechanics (the mass times the acceleration is the sum of the forces). This equation represents the wave function (a.k.a. the quantum state) evolution of some physical system, including molecular, atomic of subatomic systems, as well as macroscopic systems like the universe. The solution of the imaginary time Schr√∂dinger equation (a.k.a. the heat equation) is given by a Feynman-Kac distribution associated with a free evolution Markov process (often represented by Brownian motions) in the set of electronic or macromolecular configurations and some potential energy function. The long time behavior of these nonlinear semigroups is related to top eigenvalues and ground state energies of Schr√∂dinger's operators. The genetic type mean field interpretation of these Feynman-Kac models are termed Resample Monte Carlo, or Diffusion Monte Carlo methods. These branching type evolutionary algorithms are based on mutation and selection transitions. During the mutation transition, the walkers evolve randomly and independently in a potential energy landscape on particle configurations. The mean field selection process (a.k.a. quantum teleportation, population reconfiguration, resampled transition) is associated with a fitness function that reflects the particle absorption in an energy well. Configurations with low relative energy are more likely to duplicate. In molecular chemistry, and statistical physics Mean field particle methods are also used to sample Boltzmann-Gibbs measures associated with some cooling schedule, and to compute their normalizing constants (a.k.a. free energies, or partition functions). In computational biology, and more specifically in population genetics, spatial branching processes with competitive selection and migration mechanisms can also represented by mean field genetic type population dynamics models. The first moments of the occupation measures of a spatial branching process are given by Feynman-Kac distribution flows. The mean field genetic type approximation of these flows offers a fixed population size interpretation of these branching processes. Extinction probabilities can be interpreted as absorption probabilities of some Markov process evolving in some absorbing environment. These absorption models are represented by Feynman-Kac models. The long time behavior of these processes conditioned on non-extinction can be expressed in an equivalent way by quasi-invariant measures, Yaglom limits, or invariant measures of nonlinear normalized Feynman-Kac flows. In computer sciences, and more particularly in artificial intelligence these mean field type genetic algorithms are used as random search heuristics that mimic the process of evolution to generate useful solutions to complex optimization problems. These stochastic search algorithms belongs to the class of Evolutionary models. The idea is to propagate a population of feasible candidate solutions using mutation and selection mechanisms. The mean field interaction between the individuals is encapsulated in the selection and the cross-over mechanisms. In mean field games and multi-agent interacting systems theories, mean field particle processes are used to represent the collective behavior of complex systems with interacting individuals. In this context, the mean field interaction is encapsulated in the decision process of interacting agents. The limiting model as the number of agents tends to infinity is sometimes called the continuum model of agents In information theory, and more specifically in statistical machine learning and signal processing, mean field particle methods are used to sample sequentially from the conditional distributions of some random process with respect to a sequence of observations or a cascade of rare events. In discrete time nonlinear filtering problems, the conditional distributions of the random states of a signal given partial and noisy observations satisfy a nonlinear updating-prediction evolution equation. The updating step is given by Bayes' rule, and the prediction step is a Chapman- Kolmogorov transport equation. The mean field particle interpretation of these nonlinear filtering equations is a genetic type selection-mutation particle algorithm During the mutation step, the particles evolve independently of one another according to the Markov transitions of the signal . During the selection stage, particles with small relative likelihood values are killed, while the ones with high relative values are multiplied. These mean field particle techniques are also used to solve multiple-object tracking problems, and more specifically to estimate association measures The continuous time version of these particle models are mean field Moran type particle interpretations of the robust optimal filter evolution equations or the Kushner-Stratonotich stochastic partial differential equation. These genetic type mean field particle algorithms also termed Particle Filters and Sequential Monte Carlo methods are extensively and routinely used in operation research and statistical inference . The term \\"particle filters\\" was first coined in 1996 by Del Moral, and the term \\"sequential Monte Carlo\\" by Liu and Chen in 1998. Subset simulation and Monte Carlo splitting techniques are particular instances of genetic particle schemes and Feynman-Kac particle models equipped with Markov chain Monte Carlo mutation transitions Illustrations of the mean field simulation method =Countable state space models= To motivate the mean field simulation algorithm we start with S a finite or countable state space and let P(S) denote the set of all probability measures on S. Consider a sequence of probability distributions (\\\\eta_0, \\\\eta_1, \\\\cdots) on S satisfying an evolution equation: for some, possibly nonlinear, mapping \\\\Phi: P(S) \\\\to P(S). These distributions are given by vectors :\\\\eta_n=(\\\\eta_n(x))_{x\\\\in S}, that satisfy: :0 \\\\leqslant \\\\eta_n(x) \\\\leqslant 1, \\\\qquad \\\\sum olimits_{x\\\\in S}\\\\eta_n(x)=1. Therefore, \\\\Phi is a mapping from the (s-1)-unit simplex into itself, where s stands for the cardinality of the set S. When s is too large, solving equation () is intractable or computationally very costly. One natural way to approximate these evolution equations is to reduce sequentially the state space using a mean field particle model. One of the simplest mean field simulation scheme is defined by the Markov chain :\\\\xi^{(N)}_n=\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,1)}_n, \\\\cdots, \\\\xi^{(N,N)}_n \\\\right) on the product space S^N, starting with N independent random variables with probability distribution \\\\eta_0 and elementary transitions :\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\xi^{(N,1)}_{n+1}=y^1,\\\\cdots,\\\\xi^{(N,N)}_{n+1}=y^N \\\\right \\\\xi^{(N)}_n\\\\right)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^N \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\eta_n^N\\\\right)\\\\left(y^i\\\\right), with the empirical measure :\\\\eta^N_n=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N1_{\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n} where 1_x is the indicator function of the state x. In other words, given \\\\xi^{(N)}_n the samples \\\\xi^{(N)}_{n+1} are independent random variables with probability distribution \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\eta_n^N\\\\right). The rationale behind this mean field simulation technique is the following: We expect that when \\\\eta_{n}^N is a good approximation of \\\\eta_n, then \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\eta_n^N\\\\right) is an approximation of \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\eta_n\\\\right)=\\\\eta_{n+1}. Thus, since \\\\eta_{n+1}^N is the empirical measure of N conditionally independent random variables with common probability distribution \\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\eta_n^N\\\\right), we expect \\\\eta_{n+1}^N to be a good approximation of \\\\eta_{n+1}. Another strategy is to find a collection :K_{\\\\eta_n}=\\\\left(K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,y)\\\\right)_{x,y\\\\in S} of stochastic matrices indexed by \\\\eta_n\\\\in P(S) such that This formula allows us to interpret the sequence (\\\\eta_0, \\\\eta_1, \\\\cdots) as the probability distributions of the random states \\\\left(\\\\overline{X}_0, \\\\overline{X}_1, \\\\cdots \\\\right) of the nonlinear Markov chain model with elementary transitions :\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left ( \\\\left.\\\\overline{X}_{n+1}=y \\\\right \\\\overline{X}_n=x \\\\right )=K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,y), \\\\qquad \\\\text{Law}(\\\\overline{X}_n)=\\\\eta_n. A collection of Markov transitions K_{\\\\eta_n} satisfying the equation () is called a McKean interpretation of the sequence of measures \\\\eta_n. The mean field particle interpretation of () is now defined by the Markov chain :\\\\xi^{(N)}_n=\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,1)}_n, \\\\cdots, \\\\xi^{(N,N)}_n \\\\right) on the product space S^N, starting with N independent random copies of X_0 and elementary transitions :\\\\mathbf{P}\\\\left( \\\\left. \\\\xi^{(N,1)}_{n+1}=y^1,\\\\cdots,\\\\xi^{(N,N)}_{n+1}=y^N \\\\right \\\\xi^{(N)}_n\\\\right)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^N K_{n+1,\\\\eta_n^N}\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y^i\\\\right), with the empirical measure :\\\\eta^N_n=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N1_{\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n} Under some weak regularity conditions on the mapping \\\\Phi for any function f: S\\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}, we have the almost sure convergence : \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N f\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n\\\\right)\\\\to_{N\\\\uparrow\\\\infty}E\\\\left(f(\\\\overline{X}_n)\\\\right)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in S}\\\\eta_n(x)f(x) These nonlinear Markov processes and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to time non homogeneous models on general measurable state spaces. =Feynman-Kac models= To illustrate the abstract models presented above, we consider a stochastic matrix M=(M(x,y))_{x,y\\\\in S} and some function G : S \\\\to (0,1). We associate with these two objects the mapping :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\Phi : P(S) \\\\to P(S) \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\eta_n(x))_{x\\\\in S} \\\\mapsto \\\\left(\\\\Phi(\\\\eta_n)(y)\\\\right)_{y\\\\in S} \\\\end{cases} \\\\qquad \\\\Phi(\\\\eta_n)(y)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in S} \\\\Psi_{G}(\\\\eta_n)(x)M(x,y) and the Boltzmann- Gibbs measures \\\\Psi_{G}(\\\\eta_n)(x) defined by :\\\\Psi_{G}(\\\\eta_n)(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\eta_n(x)G(x)}{\\\\sum_{z\\\\in S}\\\\eta_n(z)G(z)}. We denote by K_{\\\\eta_n}=\\\\left(K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,y)\\\\right)_{x,y\\\\in S} the collection of stochastic matrices indexed by \\\\eta_n\\\\in P(S) given by :K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,y)=\\\\epsilon G(x) M(x,y)+(1-\\\\epsilon G(x)) \\\\Phi(\\\\eta_n)(y) for some parameter \\\\epsilon \\\\in [0,1]. It is readily checked that the equation () is satisfied. In addition, we can also show (cf. for instance) that the solution of () is given by the Feynman-Kac formula :\\\\eta_n(x) =\\\\frac{E\\\\left(1_x(X_n)\\\\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} G(X_p)\\\\right)}{E\\\\left(\\\\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} G(X_p) \\\\right)}, with a Markov chain X_n with initial distribution \\\\eta_0 and Markov transition M. For any function f : S\\\\to \\\\mathbf{R} we have :\\\\eta_n(f):=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in S}\\\\eta_n(x)f(x) =\\\\frac{E\\\\left(f(X_n)\\\\prod_{p=0}^{n-1}G(X_p)\\\\right)}{E\\\\left(\\\\prod_{p=0}^{n-1} G(X_p)\\\\right)} If G(x)=1 is the unit function and \\\\epsilon=1, then we have :K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,y)=M(x,y)=\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left( \\\\left. X_{n+1}=y \\\\right  X_n=x\\\\right), \\\\qquad \\\\eta_n(x) =E\\\\left(1_x(X_n)\\\\right)=\\\\mathbf{P}(X_n=x). And the equation () reduces to the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation :\\\\eta_{n+1}(y)=\\\\sum_{x\\\\in S}\\\\eta_n(x)M(x,y) \\\\qquad \\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{P}\\\\left(X_{n+1}=y\\\\right) =\\\\sum_{x\\\\in S} \\\\mathbf{P}(X_{n+1}=yX_n=x) \\\\mathbf{P}\\\\left(X_n=x\\\\right) The mean field particle interpretation of this Feynman-Kac model is defined by sampling sequentially N conditionally independent random variables \\\\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1} with probability distribution :K_{n+1,\\\\eta_n^N}\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y\\\\right)=\\\\epsilon G\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right) M\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y\\\\right)+\\\\left(1-\\\\epsilon G\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\frac{G\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n\\\\right)}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^N G\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,k)}_n\\\\right)} M\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n,y\\\\right) In other words, with a probability \\\\epsilon G\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right) the particle \\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n evolves to a new state \\\\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}=y randomly chosen with the probability distribution M\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n,y\\\\right); otherwise, \\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n jumps to a new location \\\\xi^{(N,j)}_{n} randomly chosen with a probability proportional to G\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n\\\\right) and evolves to a new state \\\\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}=y randomly chosen with the probability distribution M\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,j)}_n, y\\\\right). If G(x)=1 is the unit function and \\\\epsilon=1, the interaction between the particle vanishes and the particle model reduces to a sequence of independent copies of the Markov chain X_n. When \\\\epsilon=0 the mean field particle model described above reduces to a simple mutation-selection genetic algorithm with fitness function G and mutation transition M. These nonlinear Markov chain models and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to time non homogeneous models on general measurable state spaces (including transition states, path spaces and random excursion spaces) and continuous time models. =Gaussian nonlinear state space models= We consider a sequence of real valued random variables \\\\left (\\\\overline{X}_0, \\\\overline{X}_1, \\\\cdots \\\\right) defined sequentially by the equations with a collection W_n of independent standard Gaussian random variables, a positive parameter œÉ, some functions a,b,c: \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}, and some standard Gaussian initial random state \\\\overline{X}_0. We let \\\\eta_n be the probability distribution of the random state \\\\overline{X}_n; that is, for any bounded measurable function f, we have :E\\\\left(f(\\\\overline{X}_n)\\\\right)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} f(x) \\\\eta_n(dx), with :\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left (\\\\overline{X}_n\\\\in dx \\\\right )=\\\\eta_n(dx) The integral is the Lebesgue integral, and dx stands for an infinitesimal neighborhood of the state x. The Markov transition of the chain is given for any bounded measurable functions f by the formula :E\\\\left( \\\\left. f \\\\left (\\\\overline{X}_{n+1} \\\\right ) \\\\right \\\\overline{X}_n=x\\\\right)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,dy) f(y), with :K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,dy)=\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\left ( \\\\left.\\\\overline{X}_{n+1}\\\\in dy\\\\right  \\\\overline{X}_n=x \\\\right )=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}\\\\sigma} \\\\exp{\\\\left\\\\\\\\{-\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\left(y-\\\\left[b(x)\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} a(z) \\\\eta_n(dz)+c(x)\\\\right]\\\\right)^2\\\\right\\\\\\\\}} dy Using the tower property of conditional expectations we prove that the probability distributions \\\\eta_n satisfy the nonlinear equation :\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} \\\\eta_{n+1}(dy) f(y)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\left[\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} \\\\eta_n(dx)K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,dy)\\\\right] f(y) for any bounded measurable functions f. This equation is sometimes written in the more synthetic form :\\\\eta_{n+1} =\\\\Phi\\\\left(\\\\eta_n\\\\right)= \\\\eta_nK_{\\\\eta_n}\\\\quad\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\quad\\\\eta_{n+1}(dy)= \\\\left(\\\\eta_nK_{\\\\eta_n}\\\\right)(dy) =\\\\int_{x\\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\eta_n(dx)K_{\\\\eta_n}(x,dy) The mean field particle interpretation of this model is defined by the Markov chain :\\\\xi^{(N)}_n=\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,1)}_n, \\\\cdots, \\\\xi^{(N,N)}_n \\\\right) on the product space \\\\mathbf{R}^N by :\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_{n+1}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N a\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right)\\\\right) b\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right)+c\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right)+\\\\sigma W^i_n\\\\qquad 1\\\\leqslant i\\\\leqslant N where :\\\\xi^{(N)}_0= \\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,1)}_0, \\\\cdots, \\\\xi^{(N,N)}_0\\\\right), \\\\qquad \\\\left( W^1_n, \\\\cdots, W^N_n\\\\right) stand for N independent copies of \\\\overline{X}_0 and W_n; n \\\\geqslant 1, respectively. For regular models (for instance for bounded Lipschitz functions a, b, c) we have the almost sure convergence : \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N f\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n\\\\right)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} f(y) \\\\eta^N_n(dy) \\\\to_{N\\\\uparrow\\\\infty} E\\\\left(f(\\\\overline{X}_n)\\\\right) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}}f(y)\\\\eta_n(dy), with the empirical measure : \\\\eta^N_n=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\delta_{\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_n} for any bounded measurable functions f (cf. for instance ). In the above display, \\\\delta_x stands for the Dirac measure at the state x. =Continuous time mean field models= We consider a standard Brownian motion \\\\overline{W}_{t_n} (a.k.a. Wiener Process) evaluated on a time mesh sequence t_0=0 with a given time step t_n-t_{n-1}=h. We choose c(x)=x in equation (), we replace b(x) and œÉ by b(x) \\\\times h and \\\\sigma \\\\times \\\\sqrt{h}, and we write \\\\overline{X}_{t_n} instead of \\\\overline{X}_n the values of the random states evaluated at the time step t_n. Recalling that \\\\left(\\\\overline{W}_{t_{n+1}}-\\\\overline{W}_{t_n}\\\\right) are independent centered Gaussian random variables with variance t_n-t_{n-1} = h, the resulting equation can be rewritten in the following form -\\\\overline{X}_{t_n}=E\\\\left(a\\\\left(\\\\overline{X}_{t_n}\\\\right)\\\\right)b(\\\\overline{X}_{t_n})h+\\\\sigma\\\\left(\\\\overline{W}_{t_{n+1}}-\\\\overline{W}_{t_n}\\\\right)}} When h ‚Üí 0, the above equation converge to the nonlinear diffusion process :d\\\\overline{X}_{t}=E\\\\left(a\\\\left(\\\\overline{X}_{t}\\\\right)\\\\right)b(\\\\overline{X}_{t})dt+\\\\sigma d\\\\overline{W}_{t} The mean field continuous time model associated with these nonlinear diffusions is the (interacting) diffusion process \\\\xi^{(N)}_t=\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_t\\\\right)_{1\\\\leqslant i\\\\leqslant N} on the product space \\\\mathbf{R}^N defined by :d\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_{t}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N a\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_t\\\\right)\\\\right)b\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_t\\\\right)+\\\\sigma d\\\\overline{W}_{t}^i\\\\qquad 1\\\\leqslant i\\\\leqslant N where :\\\\xi^{(N)}_0= \\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,1)}_0, \\\\cdots, \\\\xi^{(N,N)}_0\\\\right), \\\\qquad \\\\left( \\\\overline{W}_{t}^1, \\\\cdots, \\\\overline{W}_t^N\\\\right) are N independent copies of \\\\overline{X}_0 and \\\\overline{W}_t. For regular models (for instance for bounded Lipschitz functions a, b) we have the almost sure convergence :\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N f\\\\left(\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_t\\\\right)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} f(y) \\\\eta^N_t(dy)\\\\to_{N\\\\uparrow\\\\infty} E\\\\left(f(\\\\overline{X}_t)\\\\right)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}} f(y) \\\\eta_t(dy), with \\\\eta_t=\\\\text{Law}\\\\left(\\\\overline{X}_{t}\\\\right), and the empirical measure : \\\\eta^N_t=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\delta_{\\\\xi^{(N,i)}_t} for any bounded measurable functions f (cf. for instance.).

There is a vestry on one side of the tower, and on the other side is a room erected for a library, chiefly for divinity, and founded by Dr. Busby, for the use of the vicar. The books, to the number of 618, were removed to the vicarage, and in 1848, by order of the trustees, they were numbered and properly catalogued. The old church was like that of Great Woolston, though without a turret, the two bells belonging to it hanging in arches, as at Little Linford. The registers date from the year 1065.

Background This case involved 4 victims claiming exemplary damages for sexual abuse they experienced against the offenders, all of which had been earlier prosecuted in court for this offending. The 4 cases were as follows: Daniels v Thompson - Upon the breakup of their relationship, Daniels unwisely sued his ex partner for the return of relationship property, which she lodged a counterclaim for kidnapping and rape, which resulted in him later being charged and convicted for these offences. J v Bell - J was sexually abused by a female W v W [1999] 2 NZLR 1 - sued her psychologist for sexual abuse, and although court acquitted the psychologist after an 8-day trial, still faced a civil claim H v P - H was sexually abused by her father Held The Court of Appeal ruled that to face a civil claim that had previously been dealt with in a criminal prosecution, was an \\"abuse of process\\", and accordingly the victims civil claims were struck out. J v Bell and W v W subsequently appealed unsuccessfully to the Privy Council. See [1999] UKPC 2 Footnote: As a result of this ruling, the ACT Party managed to get the law changed under section 317 of the Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Act 2001 to allow such claims in the future.

During his reign Baghistan in Ili River Valley of former Moghulistan ( with tomb of Tughluk Timur Khan, founder of Moghul Dynasty in 1347, in Almalik near Ghulja) was lost to Dzungar Khan Erdeni Batur (1634‚Äì1653) in 1651, who created Dzungar Khanate in 1634 under Choros nobility, after former Confederation of 4 Kalmyk tribes ( Khoit, Khoshut, Choros and Torghut ) collapsed in Dzungaria in 1628.

In 1682, Abd ar- Rashid Khan II was sent to Ili under escort by Dzungars, who reacted on complaint of Appak.Khoja to Galdan against Abd ar-Rashid Khan II and again were generously rewarded by him. Abd ar-Rashid Khan II fled to Beijing with his son Sultan and surrendered to the Kangxi Emperor in 1696 after Galdan's collapse. *Muhammad Imin Khan 1682‚Äì1692 (1680‚Äì1682 in Chalish, 1682 in Turfan), second son of Sultan Said Baba Khan. After his oldest brother Abd ar- Rashid Khan II was expelled, Muhammad Imin Khan was recalled from Turpan and elected a Khan on a Kurultai of Kashgar and Yarkand Begs. Organized several expeditions against Dzungars. It caused no objections from Appak Khoja, who even married Muhammad Imin Khan's sister Khanum Padshah to save his already shaken prestige and influence among population. In 1692 Muhammad Imin Khan issued State Order (Yarlik ) about expelling Appak Khoja and his son Yahiya Khoja from Yarkent Khanate. In response, Appak Khoja swore to exterminate all descendants of Chengiz Khan in the country and collected troops of his disciples. In decisive battle near Kargilik in 1692 most Muhammad Imin Khan's troops deserted him and joined Khojas. Muhammad Amin Khan fled to the mountains where he was killed. *Appak Khoja, usurper, 1692‚Äì1694, died in 1694. In 1692 set up his regime in Yarkand and Kashgar ( was declared an absolute ruler in Yarkand royal palace Altunluk with its 9 gates that led to the Hall of Reception, while his son Yahia Khoja was nominally declared a Khan) after the death of Muhammad Amin Khan, expelled Kara Taghlik leader Khoja Daniyal into Kashmir. *Yahiya Khoja (in Kashgar 1690‚Äì1692) 1692‚Äì1695, son of Appak Khoja, set up on khanship by Appak Khoja, killed in 1695 by Hanim Padsha. *Hanim Padsha (Khanum Padshah) 1695, sister of Muhammad Imin Khan, widow of Appak Khoja, was killed in 1695. *Muhammad Mumin Khan (Akbash Khan) 1695‚Äì1705, the youngest son of Sultan Said Baba Khan, great-grandson of Abdurashid Khan, disciple of Kara Taghliks, recalled Kara Taghlik leader Khoja Daniyal (died in 1735) from exile in Kashmir to resist Ak Taghliks and Dzungars, fled to India in 1705 under protection of Aurangzeb of Moghul Empire. The remnants of the state fell to two different rival branches of Khojas- Ak Taghliks and Kara Taghliks. Aqtaghlyq branch of Khojas, a confederation under the influence of the Dzungars, took power in Kashgar where Ahmad Khoja, son of Yahiya Khoja, was declared a Khan. In Yarkand Kara Taghliks took power with Khoja Daniyal being declared a Khan, that caused a civil war between Kashgar and Yarkand. In 1713 remnant of Yarkant Khanate - Altishar ( union of 6 cities, it included Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, Uchturpan, Aksu and Kucha)-became dependency of Dzungar Khanate under Tsewang Rabtan (1697‚Äì1727), paying annual tribute from all 6 cities in amount of one silver tanga from soul, for Yarkand it was established in amount of 100,000 silver tangas, for Kashgar-67,000 silver tangas, this time Kara Taghliks were established by Dzungars to be responsible for collecting tribute. In exchange, Tsewang Rabtan appointed Khoja Daniyal in 1720 a ruler of Altishar with obligation to deliver tribute to Dzungar capital in Kainuk (near present day Ghulja in Ili River Valley ) annually in person. Next Dzungar Khan Galdan Tseren (1727‚Äì1745) confirmed rights of Khoja Daniyal, but increased tribute, as result taxes, collected by Kara Taghlik Khojas in Altishar in favor of Dzungar Khanate, reached 55% of income of peasants, artisans and traders in Altishar. Increased taxes were caused by growing military expenses of 100,000 Dzungar Army that was involved in military conflicts with all neighbors of Dzungar Khanate, including Russian troops in Siberia. In 1752 Altishar restored its independence after revolt against Dzungar Khanate under leadership of Kara Taghlik leader Khoja Yusup, son of Khoja Daniyal. Khoja Yusup took advantage from struggle for power between Dzungar princes after death of Galdan Tseren in 1745, when 2 of his sons, Ajan (1745‚Äì1749) and Lama Darji (1749‚Äì1752), were killed within 7 years after short khanships and 2 nephews, Dawachi (1752‚Äì1755) and Amursana (1755‚Äì1756), came into struggle for power after that. Khoja Yusup arrested all pro-Dzungar Beks in Altishar, expelled all Dzungars from the country and stopped tribute payments to Dzungar Khanate in 1752. In May 1755 sons of Ahmad Khoja and great-grandsons of Appak Khoja, Ak Taghliks Burhan ad-Din Khoja and Jahan Khoja, were rescued by Qings troops in Ili River Valley from Dzungar's captivity (which were sent here originally by the Qianlong Emperor on demand of Amursana, who asked the Manchu emperor to aid him to overthrow Dawachi from Dzungar Khanate's reign) and sent to Altishar to claim mandate of Qing China for the country. Burhan ad-Din Khoja sent letter with ultimatum of surrender to Kara Taghlik leader Khoja Jahan, the eldest son of Khoja Daniyal, who was declared a Khan of Altishar after death of Khoja Yusup in 1755. In his letter Burhan ad-Din Khoja claimed that he was appointed a ruler of Altishar by new Dzungar Khan Amursana ( old Dzungar Khan Dawachi fled to Uchturpan after losing battle to Qing troops in Baghistan (Ili River Valley) where he was captured with his son Lodja Noyon by Burhan ad-Din Khoja's people in July 1755, then handed over to Qing troops in Ili on August 1, 1755, Qings delivered him to Beijing for imprisonment on November 20, 1755) and Amursana in turn was appointed a Dzungar Khan by the Qianlong Emperor, so Khoja Jahan must return to Amursana all taxes that Kara Taghliks collected in Altishar for several years since 1752 and beg him for his life and lives of all relatives after that. Khoja Jahan burnt out letter of Burhan ad-Din Khoja after reading it to the people during military council in the royal palace Altunluk in Yarkand and declared a total war against Ak Taghliks. In ensuing bloody war Ak Taghlik brothers emerged victorious and established full control of Altishar in January 1756 but refused to submit to Qings after that. They killed Qing China emissary Amintu with 100 Manchu troops in Kucha on July 2, 1757, who was sent to Altishar to determine the sizes of tribute and taxes to be paid by each city monthly and annually to Qing China and also terms of sending of peasants (Taranchis) to Ili River Valley, where headquarters of Qing Army in occupied territory of New Line (Xinjiang ) were located, for cultivation of land and providing food for troops, the practice, that was previously employed by Dzungars since 1713. So, the war between Altishar and Qing China became imminent. In the end of 1759 Altishar was conquered by Qing China (with both Ak Taghlik Khojas having been killed on October 17, 1759 after fierce 2-years fighting with conquering Qing Army since spring 1758), that created province Nanlu (Southern Road) on its territory in 1760, while province Beilu (Northern Road) was created on the territory of former Dzungar Khanate, that was exterminated by Qing China during military campaigns in 1756‚Äì1757. It happened after last Dzungar Khan Amursana rebelled in October 1755 against Qing troops, which refused to leave occupied Ili River Valley, and massacred most of them, also he recognized that was deceived by the Qianlong Emperor and will never be let to rule the whole Dzungar Khanate and decided to oppose Qing plans to liquidate Dzungar Khanate with dividing Dzungaria into 4 administrative districts with separate Dzungar chieftains in each. In response, the Qianlong Emperor sent a 200,000-strong Qing army to Dzungaria in the spring of 1756 with order to quell rebellion by any means. Because resistance of Dzungars wasn't stopped and only increased, the Qianlong Emperor ordered to Military Council in Beijing on March 23, 1757 to take decisive actions against \\" Thieves and Criminals\\" and approved offer of Commander-in-chief of Qing Army in Dzungaria Zhao Hui to eliminate the whole Dzungar nation till last baby. Dzungaria was devastated during 1756‚Äì1758 with total loss of population up to 1,000 000 ( 40% of which fled, 30% were killed in actions and 30% died due to epidemic of smallpox, that started in 1757 and spread throughout all corners of Dzungaria ), completely depopulated and later colonized by migrants from different parts of China. Amursana fled to Russia where later he died due to illness, after that his dead body was handed over to Qings by Russian authorities.

In 1646 sent an embassy to Beijing to congratulate the newly proclaimed Manchu Shunzhi Emperor as first Emperor of the Qing dynasty of China, that succeeded the Ming dynasty, which was overthrown by Manchus in 1644. Embassy brought dozens of horses, camels and precision jade stones as a gift to the emperor. In accordance with ancient Chinese tradition it was declared as a Tribute from Vassal of China. In 1646 Turpan was granted by Qing China the rights to trade in the capital Beijing and in the city of Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province. *Sultan Said Baba Khan ( in Kumul 1636‚Äì1653) 1653, died in 1680 in the age of 53, 4th son of Abduraim Khan *Ibrahim Sultan ( in Khotan 1638‚Äì1653) 1653‚Äì1655, son of Abduraim Khan, was killed in 1655 *Sultan Said Baba Khan (restored) 1655‚Äì1680. In 1656 sent an embassy to Qing China with gifts for the Shunzhi Emperor, who accepted them and issued an imperial order on October 19, 1656, concerning trade regulations with Turpan, and sent back with mission 338 pieces of silk garment and 723 rolls of fine silk as a gift to Turpan ruler. *Abd ar-Rashid Khan II (in Chalish 1678‚Äì1680) 1680‚Äì1682, the eldest son of Sultan Said Baba Khan, was captured in 1682 by Dzungars and held in captivity for 14 years, was rescued in 1696 by the Kangxi Emperor's Qing troops, who launched military operations against Dzungar Galdan Boshugtu Khan in Khalkha region and defeated him here in June 1696. Abdurashid Khan II was interrogated by Qings and gave them clues about Dzungar Khan's capture, explaining that he could to flee to Kukunor only through Turpan and Kumul, which supplied his troops with food. Qings contacted ruler of Kumul Ubaidullah Khan (?‚Äì1709), he captured son of Galdan Boshugtu Khan Tsewang Baljir, who came to Kumul for food, and handed over to Qings. Galdan Boshugtu Khan died of illness in 1697, his dead body was captured by Ubaidullah Khan as well and handed over to Qings. The Kangxi Emperor rewarded Abdurashid Khan II and Ubaidullah Khan for active participating in operation for liquidating of Galdan Boshugtu Khan, Abdurashid Khan II was given permit to return to his homeland, while his son was retained in Beijing as actual hostage. Ubaidullah Khan was given the title of Jasak prince with his existing title of Tarkhan being confirmed (exemption from taxation and punishment until committing of 10th crime), the seal, imperial silk clothes and silver money, that was declared by Qings as incorporating of Kumul Khanate into Qing China. Son of Ubaidullah Khan Gapur Bek was appointed as assistant of Commander-in- chief of Qing troops in Suzhou, Gansu province, with permanent residence in this city that actually meant taking him as a hostage by Qings. * Muhammad Imin Khan 1682‚Äì1690, second son of Sultan Said Baba Khan, great-grandson of Abdurashid Khan. In 1682 sent an embassy to Qing China with gifts for the Kangxi Emperor. In his letter to the Kangxi Emperor, Muhammad Imin Khan apologized for delay of Tribute from Turpan, that was caused by recent turmoil in the country. The Kangxi Emperor accepted gifts and gave recommendation to replace horses for Jade in Tribute ( with compensation of 300 rolls of fine silk for 100 Tael (about 3.78 kg) of Jade). Embassy from Turpan was accompanied by Envoy from Kashgar Islam Khoja who informed the Kangxi Emperor of recent Dzungar invasion and asked some help against Galdan Boshugtu Khan, but result of negotiations is unknown. Annexed by the Dzungars. After exterminating of Dzungar Khanate by Qing China in 1756‚Äì1757, remnants of Dynasty survived in semi-autonomous Kumul Khanate (1696‚Äì1930) till the 20th century, last ruler of which Maqsud Shah died in 1930. In 1720 Qing troops temporarily occupied Turpan region during offensive against Dzungar Khan Tsewang Rabtan in Tibet in attempt to cut off communications of Dzungars between Tibet and Dzungaria itself. On August 13, 1720 Qing troops entered Pichan, on August 20, 1720 entered Turpan and on October 9, 1720 came to Urumchi. While local ruler Emin Khoja greeted Qing troops, other-Aziz Khoja, supported Dzungars and left Turpan with part of population, relocating them to Uchturpan and Aksu of Altishar. Next year Qing troops were forced to leave Turpan, although the Kangxi Emperor (1661‚Äì1722) tried to send reinforcements to this region. They came back only in 1755 when the Qianlong Emperor (1735‚Äì1796) managed to solve task of neutralizing of Dzungars. Emin Khoja of Turpan joined Qing troops and aided them in military campaigns against Dzungars in 1756‚Äì1757 years and Ak Taghlik Khojas in Altishar in 1758‚Äì1759 years. In January 1758, the Qianlong Emperor ordered Emin Khoja to capture region of Chalish near Turpan and create a food base here for arriving Qing troops, that planned to start offensive against Altishar on spring. On February 2, 1758 , 6 days before beginning of Chinese new lunar year of Tiger (February 8, 1758), Emin Khoja troops and accompanied Qings troops of Aligun took Kurla, Karashar was taken several days before. Nevertheless, military campaign of 1758 was devastating for Qing Army that suffered heavy casualties in the first battles with Khojas' Army. On summer Qing Army for 3 months was unable to take Kucha, which was surrounded from 3 sides by high clay city walls, that were reinforced with willow branches, while rear of the city was defended by the mountain. Artillery fire was ineffective against the clay walls and couldn't breach them, so tunnel was dug under the walls. When job was almost finished defenders of Kucha noticed the lights from the underground at night and dug pit on the rear of tunnel, then set up fire. 600 Qing soldiers in tunnel died of smoke due to suffocation, but finally city was abandoned by its defenders due to lack of supplies. In November 1758 Qing Army was surrounded by Ak Taghlik Khojas' Army near Yarkand on the Karasu river and hardly avoided full annihilation by narrowly escaping the trap in February 1759. Commander-in-chief of Qing Army Zhao Hui was wounded during escape . Contrary, campaign of summer 1759 was successful for Qing Army due to wide use of artillery, that Army of Khojas didn't have. On August 6, 1759 Qing Army took Kashgar and next day Yarkand. Ak Taghlik Khojas, brothers Burhan ad-Din Khoja and Jahan Khoja, retreated to Badakhshan where they were killed by killers, sent by Qings, on October 17, 1759. On December 23, 1759, the Qianlong Emperor declared that the military operation against Altishar is completed ( after delivering the head of Jahan Khoja to Beijing, the grave of Burhan ad-Din Khoja and his body were found by Qings in Badakhshan near village Argu, present Afghanistan, only in 1763) and New Line (Xinjiang) on the West successfully created. Emin Khoja was left as semi-autonomous ruler of Turpan and later appointed as ruler of Yarkand in the newly-created province of Nan-lu (Southern Road) in 1760, while ruler of Kumul Yusup Khoja was sent to rule Kashgar in 1760. Their sons and brothers were appointed by Qings as a local rulers, Beks (together with Kara Taghlik Beks, who supported Qings), in different cities and towns of conquered Altishar, that was divided into 8 administrative districts: Kashgar, Yarkand, Yengihissar, Khotan, Uchturpan, Aksu, Kucha and Karashar (Chalish) of province \\" Nanlu Bachen\\" or \\"Union of 8 cities on Southern Road\\". By September 1761, total 31 Hakim Beks were appointed in the cities and towns of former Altishar to collect taxes, who monthly and annually delivered them to Qing Military Coverner of New Line (Xinjiang ) in Ili River Valley in Dzungaria, the practice, that copied that of the former Dzungar Khans ( including regular sending of peasants, Taranchis, to cultivate lands in Ili to harvest crops for troops), who were finally annihilated, but were very soon replaced by the new Conqueror-Qing China.

Police were told that he lived in the \\"back flat\\" of an address, and a search warrant was duly drafted. However, when they came to the address, it was hard to determine which was the \\"back flat\\", which was unfortunate for the 3 occupants of the front flat, as well as their 3 visitors. The 6 occupants had firearms pointed at them, searched, and forced to lay on the ground, while the police proceeded to arrest the armed robbery suspect who was in the other flat. The parties sued the police for breaching the Bill of Rights Act, for unlawful search and detention. The police defended the matter claiming section 71 of the Arms Act immunized them here. Decision The Court of Appeal, sitting as a bench of five, ruled that they had been subject to unlawful detention, awarding B $18,000 and G $16,000. The court did however reverse the previous awarding of exemplary costs.

History After the Yongle Emperor usurped the throne in 1402 from his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor, he attempted to retain the officials who served in Jianwen's court, but some of them opposed him. In 1420, in order to suppress political opposition, Yongle decided to create the Eastern Depot (named as such because it was located east of the imperial palace), a spy and secret police agency run by eunuchs. They were responsible for spying on officials of any rank, including military officers, scholars, rebels and the general populace. The Eastern Depot would investigate and arrest suspects, and then hand them over to the Jinyiwei for interrogation. In the late Ming dynasty, the Eastern Depot had its own tactical forces and prisons, and became so powerful that even officials were ordered to kowtow to the Depot's leaders.. The Eastern Depot lasted to 1644, the end of the Ming Dynasty Shih-shan Henry Tsai (1996), p. 114 . There was also a government department called the Western Depot (Xichang) established by the Chenghua Emperor in 1477, originally to search for witches, but became a rival to the Eastern Depot; it lasted, except for an interval from 1482 to 1506, until 1510 Shih-shan Henry Tsai (1996), p. 118 . A third security apparatus, created to counter the two depots and the Jinyiwei, was called the Inner Branch Depot (Neixingchang) and lasted from about 1505, in the reign of the Zhengde Emperor, also until 1510 Shih-shan Henry Tsai (1996), p. 104.

His family moved to the Indiana Territory, where Cox joined the territory militia. He was promoted to a lieutenant colonel and may have seen service in the War of 1812. After the war, he became a surveyor to help support his family. He also served in county politics until the state of Illinois was formed in 1818. Cox was elected to its 1st General Assembly as a state senator, serving for two years. He then worked as Register of the U.S. Land Office in Springfield, Illinois, but fell into debt after some poor land speculation deals. Cox served again in the militia near the end of the Black Hawk War, then was appointed a surveyor of the resulting Black Hawk Purchase. He settled in Jackson County and was elected to the Iowa Territory house of representatives for three one-year terms. In 1840, Cox led a posse against a group of outlaws in what would become known as the Bellevue War. Cox was elected to the state assembly as a councilman in 1842 and served one two-year term. Early life Thomas Cox was born in Kentucky Territory, Virginia in 1787 to Robert and Jane (Robinson) Cox. The Cox family moved to the Illinois Territory in the winter after its creation in 1809, settling in Kaskaskia. Cox assisted in taking the 1810 United States Census and collected taxes, paid at the time in fur pelts. He was serving as Sheriff of Randolph County when he decided to join the militia. Cox enlisted as a private in the 1st company, 2nd Regiment, Illinois Territory Militia in early, which served for three months. The company was dismissed a few days before the outbreak of the War of 1812. He again enlisted when a mounted brigade of 350 was formed to serve with Col. William Russell. This brigade was then split into three companies; Cox was part of the 21-man scouting company captained by Samuel Judy. Cox served alongside future Governor of Illinois John Reynolds. On March 24, 1813, he was promoted to Ensign; on June 8, the militia was discharged. War of 1812 and Illinois politics The militia may have been incorporated into General Benjamin Howard's 2nd Regiment, though Cox's movements after the 1813 discharge are uncertain. Cox was promoted to a lieutenancy on April 19, 1814. On April 19, 1814, he was named captain of the 3rd Regiment of the Illinois Territory Militia. He was probably have been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel at some point, as some letters refer to him as \\"Colonel Cox\\" as early as 1820. Cox returned to Illinois to find that his father had drowned during the war. To help support his family, Cox began to practice surveying. His work took him to New Madrid, Louisiana Territory, where he recorded changes from the 1811‚Äì12 New Madrid earthquakes. Cox became a land speculator, largely in what is now northeastern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri; this surveying knowledge gave him unique opportunities to acquire lands. When Union County, Illinois was founded on April 8, 1818, Governor Ninian Edwards appointed Cox a justice of the peace. When the state was officially recognized that December, Cox was elected one of the first state senators, serving for two years. Cox expanded his land speculation to central Illinois in 1821, including a home in the new Sangamon County. Governor Edwards recommended Cox as Register of the United States Land Office in Springfield, which was approved by President James Monroe. He began work on January 28, 1823. Along with Elijah Iles, Daniel Pope Cook, and Pascal P. Enos, Cox platted the town of Springfield. Cox apparently opened a hotel in the town at some point, which was in operation by 1827, when Dr. John Todd succeeded Cox as Register. Cox's land speculations by this point had depreciated in value. Most of his property had to be sold to free himself from debt. Black Hawk War In 1827, a tribe of Winnebago around Prairie du Chien, Michigan Territory, caused alarm for political leaders in Illinois. A regiment formed in the state in anticipation of battle, but Cox declined to serve because. His relationship with Governor Edwards had been severed, as Cox had owed Edwards a large sum of money through his speculations. On May 8, 1832, Isaiah Stillman's company was attacked by the Winnebago at the Battle of Stillman's Run. This prompted new governor John Reynolds, who previously served with Cox, to raise six more companies of militia. Although Cox was old enough to be exempt from duty, Reynolds offered him the rank of colonel; however, Cox declined, perhaps due to his financial problems. In his place, he recommend his brother-in-law James Collins. When a scouting company was raised in neighboring Morgan County, Cox decided to enlist. The company, under the leadership of William Lee D. Ewing, saw action in the Battle of Wisconsin Heights on July 21, 1832. They then pursued Black Hawk's band to the Mississippi River. Following the ensuing Battle of Bad Axe, the last engagement of the war, Cox was mustered out with the rest of his company on August 16, 1832. Iowa settlement Upon his return to Illinois, he accepted an offer to join his brothers-in-law, Lemuel and William Bartlett, in an operation in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. Soon after, however, Cox was appointed United States Deputy Surveyor to subdivide a portion of the Black Hawk Purchase in the Wisconsin Territory. Cox settled in White Oak Springs to be closer to his work. Cox surveyed ten townships in what is now Jackson County, Iowa through the fall of 1837. Many members of Cox's family came to the county while he surveyed it. His brother, John W. Cox, built the first sawmill in the county. Six brothers-in-law joined him, as well as his brother Enoch. Cox himself selected a site for a new home that summer on the north bank of the Maquoketa River on the road between Dubuque and Davenport. His immediate family joined him the next spring. Cox named his new farm and the surrounding area Richland. Iowa Territory politics On July 4, 1838, the Iowa Territory was formed. Cox's political experience made him an ideal candidate for the new territorial legislature. Cox was elected to the first territorial assembly in the four-man house of representatives. Cox ended a dispute in the assembly regarding the capital of Iowa by suggesting that it be built in an entirely new city. Although initially rejected, the idea was later adapted and Cox chose the name \\"Iowa City\\". Cox was selected as one of the two surveyors commissioned to plat the town. While Cox was in Iowa City, a caucus was held to nominate a candidate for the next assembly. Cox expected to be re- elected, even in his absence, but instead a Bellevue hotel-keeper named W. W. Brown secured the Democratic Party nomination. Cox returned home and announced that he would run as an independent. He accused Brown of connections with organized crime, members of which were known to frequent Brown's hotel. Cox was elected to the second assembly, which opened in November 1839. When the session concluded in January 1840, Cox returned to Jackson County to find that it was being harassed by a gang of outlaws. When former Sangamon County colleague Ebenezer Brigham came to the county seeking a horse thief. Cox suspected James Thompson, a boarder in Brown's hotel. Probate Judge James K. Moss authorized Cox and sheriff Warren to organize a posse to apprehend Brown and Thompson's gang. After a parley between Brown and Warren broke down, Cox led the posse in an attack against the hotel. Brown surrendered, but as he was lowering his rifle, he accidentally discharged his weapon, which fired a bullet through Cox's coat. Two members of the posse thought that Brown was firing in anger and shot him dead. As fire continued to be exchanged between the posse and hotel residents, the hotel was set on fire. Thirteen fleeing outlaws were apprehended. In the ensuing trial, they were whipped and told not to return to the county; one member, William Fox, joined the Banditti of the Prairie. The jury also determined that the posse acted appropriately in the interests of the law in what became known as the Bellevue War. The actions of the posse outraged some local politicians, who called for Cox's expulsion from the legislature. However, there is no record of any impeachment attempt made in the assembly; in fact, he was named Speaker of the House pro tempore for the opening of a special session that July. Cox was commissioned to plat Scotch Grove as the county seat of Jones County, but the residents did not built a courthouse. Cox was then sent to plat the nearby Lexington, now known as Anamosa, which became the seat. In August 1840, he was re-elected to a third term in the territorial house. When the assembly gathered, Cox was elected Speaker of the House almost unanimously. He was then re-elected the next August, but declined the office for unknown reasons. James K. Moss, who fought with Cox in the Bellevue War, was elected in a special election in his place. In 1842, Cox vied as an independent for a seat on the territorial council, the higher legislative body. Cox defeated Francis Gehon and Hardin Nowlin for a two-year term. In his second year of service, the 6th assembly, Cox was elected President of the Council after thirty-one ballots. Death and burial In late 1844, Cox caught pneumonia. He died on November 9, 1844 from the disease and \\"liver congestion\\". Rev. William Salter of the Iowa Band officiated his funeral the next day. Cox was buried under a tree at his farm that he had previously identified as his final resting place. In 1904, the Jackson County Historical Society moved his remains to Mount Hope Cemetery in Maquoketa, Iowa. A granite boulder from his farm was also moved the cemetery as a monument to Cox on July 4, 1905.

Unbeknown to him, a MOT traffic officer was following him with the intent to do a random stop on him. However, before the traffic officer could pull him over, he had reached his destination, and had pulled up his parents driveway and entered the house. The traffic officer then parked his car up the driveway and proceeded to talk to Howden. Howden was then asked to sit in the patrol car whilst his driving licence details were checked. The officer then parked his car on the Road (a public place), where Howden admitted he had consumed alcohol. As a result of this statement, he was ordered to perform a breath test, which he failed. He was charged and later convicted of the offence of driving under the influence of alcohol, being fined $250 and disqualified from driving for 6 months. Howden subsequently appealed the conviction unsuccessfully to the District Court, on the basis that the breath test was illegally obtained as a result of the traffic officer trespassing, and appealed this time to the High Court. Held The court held that although a person has an implied licence to enter a property, this licence can only be actioned in a reasonable manner. Entering a property at 1.30am in the morning, most people would find an unreasonable hour. That meant that the Traffic officer was trespassing at the time, making the breath test illegal, resulting in the court overturning the conviction. Footnote: As a result of this court case, the government soon changed the law to make such situations legal.

Early life Shulman was born in Berdichev, Ukraine, Russia, on July 25, 1900. (However, his official Russian birth certificate, presented to the family following his death, recorded his birth date as July 3, 1898.). Both parents were very religious Jews. His mother, Rachel Nemerov Shulman, brought all of her six children to the United States in 1904. His father, Maurice (Elimelech), a peddler, had refused to leave Russia and died either shortly before or after the family left for America. The family settled in Cleveland, Ohio. They were very poor and Charles, the fifth of the six siblings, worked a newspaper route from a very young age to help meet the family's financial needs. Education Shulman studied at Ohio Northern University from 1916-1920, received the Bachelor of Law degree in 1920 and was admitted to the Ohio state bar in the same year. He soon found himself increasingly interested in religion and opted for a future career in the rabbinate. He attended the University of Cincinnati 1922-23. From 1923-24, he studied at the University of Chicago where he received his Ph.B (Bachelor of Philosophy). He received his M. A. in Comparative Religion from the same university in 1930. He studied at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1922‚Äì27 and was ordained as a Reform rabbi in 1927. Brief Professional Summary Shulman first worked in the Law Department for the N.Y. Central Railroad, Cleveland, Ohio (1920) and then for the Acheson, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, Albuquerque, New Mexico (1921). His first pulpit for the rabbinate was at Johnstown, Pennsylvania (1926‚Äì27); following this, he served at Congregation Leshem Shomayim in Wheeling, West Virginia (1927‚Äì31) . From 1931 until 1946, he was the rabbi of the North Shore Congregation Israel, Glencoe, Illinois, after which he left to become the founding rabbi of Riverdale Temple, The Liberal Synagogue, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, where he presided from 1947 until his death in 1968. World War II Shulman enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1943. He began training as a chaplain in the same year in Norfolk, Virginia. He first served as chaplain at Newport, Quonset and Camp Endicott in Rhode Island. He was the sole Jewish Naval Chaplain in all of New England at that time. From November, 1944 to October, 1945, he served as the first Jewish chaplain and the only rabbi among 225 chaplains in the Seventh Fleet in the South Pacific Theater of Operations, commanded by Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, (also Commander of the Allied Naval Forces of the South Pacific). As such, he traveled constantly between Australia and the Philippines, covering over 125,000 miles among 26 islands. In 1945, he received the Navy Commendation Award for outstanding service overseas . He completed his naval service in January, 1946. He was awarded the Service Recognition Certificate Citation for Meritorious Service by the State of Illinois in 1947. He was honorably discharged from the Navy on Jan. 25, 1951. The Rabbinate Shulman's first long-term tenure as rabbi was at the North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe, Illinois. Under his leadership there, the membership quadrupled and grew to be one of the leading Jewish congregations in the United States. He developed forums, lectures and inter-faith activities devoted to promotion of better citizenship and spiritual and intellectual advancement. At age 34,he was the youngest reform rabbi to be listed in the Who's Who in America. In addition to his rabbinical duties, he was the president of the Chicago Rabbinical Association, vice president of the National Association of Jewish Chaplains and state chaplain of the Jewish War Veterans of Illinois. Under the auspices of the National, Conference of Christians and Jews as well as the Anti- Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith he addressed many non-sectarian audiences throughout the United States interested in the perpetuation of religion and democracy. His messages were also broadcast over the radio. Under his influence, the temple gained recognition as one of the outstanding Jewish congregations in the United States. Shulman, an avid Zionist, resigned from his position in 1947 as a result of strongly conflicting ideologies with the majority of the board members of the Congregation, who were strongly anti- Zionist and felt that Zionism was a danger to the future of Jewish religious life. He sought to establish a synagogue that would be liberal in nature, and would instill Jewish values that would be relevant to the congregants. He wanted to incorporate many of the Hebrew traditions and to provide an intellectual understanding of the religion. He desired to make it exciting and challenging and democratic. \\"The people must feel they are sharing in it. They must be excited by the aesthetic beauty of it, by the beauty of the music, by the originality with which religion is presented. \\" And of course he also wanted a congregation that would support the new State of Israel. Thus he decided to move to New York where a group of 25 families in the Riverdale area of the Bronx were seeking a rabbi. During the first year, 1947‚Äì48, his congregation grew from 25 families to 250 and to more than 1000 at the close of his life. In addition to the goals he had originally set for himself, he was a strong proponent of interfaith cooperation and understanding. He initiated interdenominational Thanksgiving services, which became a community tradition and was adopted by many religious institutions nationwide. He also became a leading spokesman on behalf of Zionism and the Jewish State. Similarly recognized were the venues that served Riverdale Temple until the permanent edifice was completed in 1954. It was first housed in Ben Riley's Arrowhead Inn, an enormous Spanish ‚ÄìMoorish building on a large hill sprawling over 16 acres on the banks of the Hudson River. When this structure was demolished five years later, to make way for luxury apartments, Shulman was invited to share the premises of the parish house of the rector of the local Episcopalian Christ Church, Reverend Gerald V. Barry, which received national and international attention . The new Temple was dedicated in 1954. He addressed numerous groups around the country and made frequent national radio and television broadcasts. He also participated extensively in Jewish and inter-faith educational programs. He became a nationwide lecturer for Zionist causes, fund-raising for Bonds for the Israel Government and the United Jewish Appeal. In addition, he was closely associated with the leading Zionist leaders and statesmen in Israel.

Roshika Deo is a Fijian feminist and activist. She is the founder of the Be The Change Campaign/Movement in Fiji, which is a movement endorsing feminism, LGBTIQ, disability, human rights, and environmentalism. Her organisation aims to bringing social, political, economic and cultural change to Fiji.  Career  Roshika Deo contended as an independent candidate for the general elections in September, 2014, and was the first candidate to register.http://www.awiu.org/2014/04/06/introducing- roshika-deo-a-2014-woman-of-courage/ She ran independently during the election, rejecting offers of support from established parties as these parties did not hold a clear position on her primary rights-based concerns. Though the 1055 votes she received in the election was not enough to enter parliament, it was more than many seasoned politicians and more than the people who were able to enter as part of their party. Following the election she began work to establish the proposed Be The Change Party to cement her dedication to human rights, women's rights and LGBTIQ rights into a platform of political activism and for young people in Fiji to have a voice. She is currently working to collect the 5000 signatures needed for party registration. Ms Deo's choice to run independently garnered her criticism from various sources, including the established political parties, church leaders and government-friendly newspaper. She also faced gender-based online harassment including threats and graphic manipulated photos. Her response has been one of persistence, never shying from opportunities to promote her message of gender equality and calling for effective representation of women in politics. When asked if she is able to \\"run with the boys\\", she pointed out that this gendered language demonstrates the hurdles that women face politically. As a pioneering female politician in Fiji, Ms Deo's career has drawn academic attention internationally. Priya Chattier, Research Fellow in Gender at the Australian National University 's State, Society and Governance in Melanesia Program, presented Ms Deo's experience in the presentation \\"Power, Politics and Positive Deviance\\" at the DLP Annual Conference 2016. In 2009 Ms Deo became the youngest person in the pacific to have received the Paul Harris Fellowship Award, which she was given in recognition of her enthusiasm and commitment to helping her community. She was nominated for the Amnesty International Human Rights Defender award in 2013. She also received US Secretary of State International Women of Courage Award from Michelle Obama 2014, once again as the youngest Pacific recipient to date. She is widely known for her advocacy and work in the area of women's rights and ending violence against girls and women. She has had leadership and professional experience working in feminist non-governmental organisations and UN agencies in the Pacific region. She initiated the Take Back the Streets march while working in the Emerging Leaders Forum (ELF) in the Fiji Women's Rights Movement. Fiji was the first country in the Pacific to hold a presentation of the Vagina Monologues under Ms Deo's initiative. She also introduced the One Billion Rising Campaign to the Pacific  Personal life  Roshika Deo belongs to an Indo-Fijian Hindu family. Her father Indar Deo was a well-known councillor, politician for the National Alliance Party and businessman, who now lives in Australia. She said in a Fiji Sun interview that when she was young she had told her father that she wanted to be the Prime Minister of Fiji, he discouraged her at the time but now she thinks that \\"anything is possible\\".

History  Economics in Louisiana and Sicily combined to bring about what became known as the Great Migration of thousands of Sicilians. The end of the Civil War allowed the freed men the choice to stay or to go, many chose to leave for higher paying jobs, which in turn led to a perceived scarcity of labor resources for the planters. Northern Italy enjoyed the fruits of modern industrialization, while southern Italy and Sicily suffered destitute conditions under the system of absentee landowners. The peasant was still essentially the serf in the system. Emigration not only offered peasants a chance to move beyond subsistence living, it also offered them a chance to pursue their own dreams of proprietorship as farmers or other business owners. On March 17, 1866, the Louisiana Bureau of Immigration was formed and planters began to look to Sicily as a possible solution to their labor needs. Steamship companies advertisements were very effective in recruiting potential workers. . Three steamships per month were running between New Orleans and Sicily by September 1881 at a cost of only forty dollars per person.

Suspicion fell on Italians, whose growing numbers in the city made other whites nervous.\\"ANTI- ITALIAN MOOD LED TO 1891 LYNCHINGS\\" (Archive). The Times-Picayune. March 14, 1991. p. B1. Retrieved on August 28, 2014. The March 14, 1891 New Orleans lynchings were the largest ever mass lynchings in Louisiana history. The use of the term \\"mafia\\" by local media in relation to the murder is the first- known usage of the word in print. Geography \\"Little Palermo\\" was established by recent immigrants in the lower French Quarter. So many Italians settled here that some suggested the area should be renamed as \\"The Sicilian Quarter\\" in the early 20th century. As time passed and they became established, many Italian-Americans moved out of New Orleans and to the suburbs. Economy Historically many corner stores in New Orleans were owned by Italians. Progresso Foods originated as a New Orleans Italian-American business. The business established by the Vaccaro brothers later became Standard Fruit. After they first arrived, Italian immigrants generally took low-wage laboring jobs, which they could accomplish without being able to speak English. They worked on docks, in macaroni factories, and in nearby sugar plantations. Some went to the French Market to sell fruit. Italian workers became a significant presence in the French Market. Organizations In 1843 the Societ√† Italiana di Mutua Beneficenza was established. The San Bartolomeo Society, established by immigrants from Ustica, was established in 1879. As of 2004 it is the oldest Italian-American society in New Orleans. Joseph Maselli, an ethnic Italian from New Orleans, founded the first pan-U.S. Italian-American federation of organizations. The American Italian Cultural Center honors and celebrates the area's Italian-American heritage and culture. The AICC houses the American Italian Museum, with exhibits about the history and contributions of Italian-Americans to the region. The Piazza d'Italia is a local monument dedicated to the Italian-American community of New Orleans. Recreation On St. Joseph's Day, ethnic Sicilians in the New Orleans area establish altars. On that day marches organized by the Italian-American Marching Club occur. The club, which welcomes anyone of Italian origins, started in 1971 and as of 2004 has more than 1,500 members. Italian Americans originally established the Krewe of Virgilians because they were unable to join other Krewes in the Mardi Gras. In 1936 the krewes crowned their first queen, Marguerite Piazza, who worked in the New Orleans Metropolitan Opera. Cuisine Italians in New Orleans brought with them many dishes from Sicilian cuisine and broader Italian cuisines, which influenced the Cuisine of New Orleans. Many food businesses and restaurants were started by Italians in New Orleans. Progresso, now a large Italian food brand, was started by Sicilian immigrants to New Orleans. Angelo Brocato's an Italian Ice Cream parlor and bakery, established in 1905 by a Sicilian immigrant, is still in existence today. Central Grocery, also founded by a Sicilian immigrant and still in business, originated the muffaletta sandwich, served on the traditional Sicilian muffaletta bread.

She is the author of The Flavors of Southern Italy, Pasta Improvvisata, and Williams-Sonoma Pasta, and contributed to the Italian section of the 1997 revision of Joy of Cooking. She is a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals, the Italy-based international Slow Food movement, and the Culinary Historians of New York.  Background  Erica developed her interest in cooking as a teenager, drawing inspiration from the recipes she grew up with in her family's southern Italian‚ÄìAmerican kitchen on Long Island. She studied journalism at the Fashion Institute of Technology from 1975 to 1977 and at New York University from 1977 to 1979, and attended the New York Restaurant School from 1983 to 1984. In 1985, she began cooking at Manhattan restaurants, including Le Madri and The Florent. Her play, Kitchen Arts, a comedy about cooking, was produced at Manhattan's 13th Street Repertory Company in 1987.  Cooking style  As the titles of her books imply, Erica's cooking is improvisation-driven and her style derived from the flavors of southern Italy: the bitter olive oil and oranges, the honey laced agrodolce (sweet and sour), the salty anchovies, capers, and olives, and the mix of peasant and regal that are hallmarks of the cooking of the mezzogiorno. Her family's food, from inland Apulia, with its flavors of tomato, garlic, and wild greens, inspired research that eventually took her to Sicily, Naples, and Calabria. There she studied the traditional cooking of the entire region, expanding her palate, and soon began improvising while never straying too far from the flavors that give southern Italian cooking its distinctive charm. Southern Italians recognize Erica's dishes, even at their most creative, as being purely southern Italian in spirit, at least in part because of her continuous search for the best and most authentic ingredients available. She has stated that she never makes a dish exactly the same way twice‚Äîa radically different approach from her family's, where the rules of traditional Italian cooking were set in stone.  Books and journalism  Erica's first published articles appeared in Food & Wine magazine in 1993 (she also worked in their test kitchen), and subsequently in The New York Times, Gourmet, and Fine Cooking, among other publications. Her monthly food column appeared in Marie Claire magazine from 1997 to 1999. A monthly column on the Mediterranean diet appeared in MyCurves, an online publication of Curves Fitness, the international fitness chain, from 2012 to 2014. In 2015 she began developing recipes and writing for Weight Watchers. Her first book, Pasta Improvvisata, published by Scribner in 1999, was chosen by The New York Times as one of the best cookbooks of the season for its June 1999, twice-yearly cookbook roundup. That was followed by Pasta, for Williams-Sonoma, in 2003, and The Flavors of Southern Italy, published by John Wiley & Sons in 2005. The latter was chosen by both Publishers Weekly and Food & Wine as one of the best cookbooks of the year. She is currently working on a collection of essays on Italian flavor combinations. A novel-in-progress about a hapless American magazine editor abroad in Italy, written with Barbara Calamari, is tentatively entitled Devil Lady.  Media and appearances  Since 1998, Erica's blog (originally Skinny Guinea, currently Improvisation Italian-Style) has offered many of her recipes, as well as essays on her cooking philosophy, reviews of her books, and her carefully chosen artwork, illustrated by a popular running feature, Women with Fish. She has appeared on Food Talk with Arthur Schwartz, on the Food Network, on Bloomberg Radio‚Äôs Dining with Peter Elliot, on the Heritage Radio Network, and on other national and local radio and TV shows. She has given cooking demonstrations at numerous gourmet shops, bookstores, farmers‚Äô markets, and culinary events, including De Gustibus and The New York Times Style magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúTaste of T.‚Äù She also teaches private and group cooking classes on southern Italian cooking and diet.

Under the leadership of Michael Healy, president and chief stockholder of Hibernia, the brewery introduced several specialty brews considered innovative for their time and became one of the first producers in the American Midwest of what now are considered to be craft beers and ales. At its peak, Hibernia produced over 30,000 barrels of beer per year, employed about 50 workers, and had a market range that included Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, St. Louis, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, with success also in Denver and Boulder, Colorado to the west and south; and Chicago, Milwaukee, and suburban Cleveland, Ohio to the east.Scott Lautenschlager and John Keefe, ‚Äú‚ÄôMicrobreweries‚Äô On the Move,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 2 Aug. 1987 [Section 3]: 1. The brewery quickly earned a reputation for quality products, aided by the receipt of a second place award for its Hibernia Dunkel Weizen in the Great American Beer Festival of 1985. However, the release of underpasteurized beer to new markets was an economic disaster. Although the brewmaster and assistant brewmaster were fired immediately and insurance covered the recall, it was impossible to get the consumer to give them a second chance. This combined with increasing competition from the growing number of companies passing themselves off as brewers, when in fact they were sales/marketing entities that outsourced the manufacturing of their beers.  Origins  The Walter brewing operation was originally established in Eau Claire in 1878 as the Henry Sommermeyer & Co. Dells Brewery, at the corner of Hobart and Elm Streets. It was acquired by Johannes (John) Walter, a German immigrant from the Wuerttemberg area, in 1890.Dale P. Van Wieren, American Breweries II (West Point, PA: Eastern Coast Breweriana Association, 1995) 394. The firm survived most of Prohibition by manufacturing wort (fermenting malt), closing in 1931 before reopening two years later upon repeal.Jerry Apps, Breweries of Wisconsin (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992) 159. Walter managed to survive the most intense period of consolidation of the American brewing industry, from shortly after World War II through the 1970s, producing nearly 47,000 barrels in 1979 and a high-water mark of nearly 64,000 barrels in 1980.Apps, Breweries of Wisconsin 160-161. Changing consumer tastes and very aggressive marketing by stronger national brewers made it impossible for a brewery like Walter, already in basic survival mode, to continue operating. In 1981 Walter's output fell to just over 50,000 barrels, distributed within a sales radius of some 30 miles, and by the end of 1984 its total production had fallen to a paltry 18,000 barrels per year. Brewing activity was down to just one day per week, and only 22 employees, most working part-time, remained on the payroll. Although brewing industry success was predicated upon active marketing, Walter's advertising budget had fallen to zero, and the company's prospects appeared so bleak that a business class at the University of Wisconsin recommended that it be shut down.Bill Richards, ‚ÄúOne Giant Step,‚Äù Wall Street Journal 19 May 1986: 10D. The operation was within weeks of bankruptcy when Michael Healy, a Chicago businessman, bought the brewery effective May 1, 1985.Jeremy Iggers, ‚ÄúForget It, Joe Six-Pack,‚Äù Minneapolis Star and Tribune [Sunday Magazine] 20 Jul. 1986: 8. Although Healy had no previous experience working in the brewing industry, he was a stranger neither to the beverage trade nor to what motivated him to take the company in a new direction. Born and raised on the northwest side of Chicago, Healy tended bar at his father's tavern, Mike Healy's Public House, and while serving in the military in Germany in the mid-1960s, he developed a taste for the more flavorful, fuller-bodied lager beers that dominated there. As Healy noted in 1985 and afterward, ‚ÄúThat spoiled me, because when I came home I just couldn‚Äôt redevelop a taste for American beer.‚ÄùBill Stokes, ‚ÄúA Brewer Takes a Stand to Beat the Bland,‚Äù Chicago Tribune 20 Sep. 1985 [Section 5]: 3. See also ‚ÄúSpecialty Brewer Stressing Quality,‚Äù La Crosse Tribune 19 Oct. 1985 [Business Section]: 11.  Changing circumstances and directions  The strengths of larger breweries, combined with a flat growth rate in the beer market, played a large role in the demise of Walter. The major national brewers‚Äîwhich used advertising, their economies of size, and an efficient national distribution system‚Äîessentially traded the same customers with other national brewers and grew at the expense of smaller breweries, whose dwindling market share ultimately led to bankruptcy and closure in all but a handful of cases. Through expansive and expensive advertising campaigns, the national brewers were able to convince American beer drinkers that what they were offering was what beer was supposed to look and taste like. However, an increasing number of consumers complained of a taste profile bordering on blandness. Unable to spend any money on advertising/promotion, Walter increasingly opted for discount pricing in an effort to sell more beer, joining in the failing footsteps of many small local brewers that attempted to create sales volume with low prices. They found that their products acquired a lasting reputation for lower quality, thereby harming sales still further. At the same time, Walter failed to recognize a critically important change taking place as consumer tastes were moving toward more flavorful, stylistically distinctive brews, demonstrated by the fact that the only true growth in the industry at the time was exhibited by the imported beer segment. As the 1980s progressed, the key to survival for small brewers lay in recognizing and catering to this change in consumer demand, and in turn offering products that the national brewers did not produce and could not make in limited quantities. As Healy noted at the time, ‚ÄúA small brewer cannot compete with the big guys on their terms. We came in with plans to do something different, and everyone welcomed us with open arms.‚ÄùStokes, ‚ÄúA Brewer Takes a Stand to Beat the Bland,‚Äù 20 Sep. 1985 [Section 5]: 1. Unfortunately, under Walter's management, which had continued to try to compete with the national brewers by offering identical-looking, nondescript- tasting adjunct beers, no thought was given to producing all-malt products. The firm made only lager beers, and its entire product mix contained not a single ale. Before buying Walter, Healy made the choice of being responsible for everything carrying the Hibernia name and not joining the increasing number of contract companies pretending to have their own facilities. Healy felt that full disclosure was the correct way to present his products as Hibernia's and only Hibernia's, under the philosophy that having someone else brew, bottle, can, and keg their beer, but then put their name on the finished product, did not equate to being a brewery. Healy renamed the company Hibernia Brewing Ltd.‚ÄîHibernia being the Latin name for Ireland, a nod to his ethnic heritage‚Äîand immediately made plans to produce all-malt beers, brews consisting of only hops, yeast, malt, and water and made according to the German beer purity law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516. Healy believed that there was no reason to drink imported beer when he could import the brewmaster, which is what he did. Armed with the fact that the beverage choices offered to beer drinkers rivaled or surpassed those enjoyed by wine drinkers, and with the knowledge that America could produce world-class brews, Healy introduced excellent, award-winning craft beers. These included the year-round Eau Claire All Malt Lager Beer and the seasonal brews Oktober Fest (fall), Winter Brau, Bock (spring), and Dunkel Weizen (summer), with a plan to release European- style stout, ale, and porter at a later date.Tim Scott, ‚ÄúEau Claire Brewery Will Switch to Special Beers,‚Äù Milwaukee Sentinel (Regional News) 2 May 1985 [Part 1]: 12. The flagship beer, Eau Claire All Malt, was brewed to a Vienna- style lager recipe and advertised under the slogans ‚ÄúReal Beer Is Here!‚Äù and ‚ÄúReal Beer Returns.‚Äù Though described in promotional literature as being ‚Äúa return to John Walter‚Äôs original beer of the 1880s,‚Äù the formulation was created by Gary Bauer, a Milwaukee homebrewer, under specifications given to him by Healy and with refinement by Hibernia brewmasters.Peg Masterson, ‚ÄúHealy Sees Market for Rich Beers,‚Äù Milwaukee Sentinel [Tuesday Business] 29 Oct. 1985 [Part 4]: 16. The second beer introduced by Healy in 1985, Dunkel Weizen, represented the first American-brewed dark wheat beer since the advent of Prohibition in 1919.Masterson, ‚ÄúHealy Sees Market for Rich Beers,‚Äù 29 Oct. 1985 [Part 4]: 16. In addition to its specialty beers, Hibernia continued to manufacture several brews from the Walter product line, primarily for the traditional Eau Claire market, including the former flagship Walter's Lager Beer, Walter's Special Beer, and Walter's Light Beer.Sue Lendman, ‚ÄúChuck Walter: He‚Äôd Rather Sell Than Close Walter‚Äôs Doors,‚Äù Chippewa Herald Telegram 23 Feb. 1985 [Section A]: 3. Although Walter's Lager and Walter's Special had been brewed essentially to the same recipe in the last days of the Walter brewing operation, Healy reformulated the beers upward so that each had its own distinctive formula under Hibernia. Non-alcoholic beverages also factored into the Hibernia product line over time. Two soft drinks were created in 1985‚Äîa root beer and a cream soda‚Äîmaking Hibernia one of the earliest craft brewery producers of carbonated sodas. In 1987, in a further attempt to diversify, the brewery began to bottle carbonated and flavored Eau Claire Spring Water. The water was derived from a farm well near Eau Claire and in independent laboratory testing was found to be particularly pure.Maryann Mrowca, ‚Äú3 Small State Breweries Plan to Stay Put, Compete,‚Äù Capital Times 15 Dec. 1987: 26.  Early success  The newness of the Hibernia specialty beers allowed Healy to penetrate markets and retail outlets that previously had been unavailable to the brewery, drawing interest from distributors in the Twin Cities, Chicago, and St. Louis, among other locations. Draft accounts were particularly receptive to Healy's sales pitch that by taking on the Hibernia seasonal beer line, they would have a different Hibernia beer on tap every three months, or four distinct beers each year‚Äîwithout adding new tap lines‚Äîand a corresponding increase in sales that each prompted from both new and returning customers. The image of superior quality that Healy strove to promote with his beers received a significant start with the results of the 1985 Great American Beer Festival, in which Hibernia Dunkel Weizen took second place overall (out of 104 entries) in the Consumer Preference Poll at the competition‚Äîtrailing only another new beer at the time, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, a contract brew‚Äîand Eau Claire All Malt scored first out of 45 beers in the lager competition.Results of the 1985 Great American Beer Festival Consumer Preference Poll are available online: (retrieved 15 Apr. 2014). See also ‚ÄúHibernia Wins Second in Beer Competition,‚Äù Eau Claire Leader-Telegram 4 Jun. 1985: 1D. Healy expressed justifiable pride in the accomplishment, noting that ‚Äúthere hasn‚Äôt been a commercially brewed dark wheat beer in this country in 65 years. It‚Äôs the right idea at the right time. ‚Ä¶ I think American beer drinkers will discover Americans can make a beer that‚Äôs as good as anybody‚Äôs in the world if they take the time to do it.‚ÄùMasterson, ‚ÄúHealy Sees Market for Rich Beers,‚Äù 29 Oct. 1985 [Part 4]: 16. Subsequent feature articles in various local and regional newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, brought Hibernia still more valuable publicity and widespread name recognition. The increasing news media coverage augmented extensive personal efforts by Healy to promote the Hibernia product line, including frequent guest spots on local radio and television programs as far away as Madison, Wisconsin; Omaha, Nebraska; and Columbus, Ohio. For appearances at bars and restaurants where Hibernia beers were sold and personal meetings with brewery visitors, Healy took time away from work to welcome guests, invite them to tour the plant, and answer questions about the operation. In a further respectful gesture, in early June 1985, Healy took out a full-page advertisement in the local newspaper, the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram, to thank the individuals and organizations that had helped with the transition of the brewery from Walter to Hibernia.Michael J. Healy, ‚ÄúThank You,‚Äù Eau Claire Leader-Telegram 4 Jun. 1985: 8D. The extensive promotional activities and interaction with potential customers meshed well with the entrepreneur's outgoing personality‚Äîand corresponding physical presence, at six-foot-five in height and 240 pounds in weight‚Äîas well as his prior experience in sales, with the Hibernia name quickly growing in prominence within the brewery's target markets. A sense of personal enjoyment made the heavy workload more palatable to Healy, who stressed that ‚Äúone thing we decided when we started was that we weren‚Äôt going to do this if it wasn‚Äôt fun. Well, it may seem strange when you are working 20-hour days, but so far we‚Äôre having fun.‚ÄùStokes, ‚ÄúA Brewer Takes a Stand to Beat the Bland,‚Äù 20 Sep. 1985 [Section 5]: 3. Early results were encouraging: initial demand for Eau Claire All Malt outstripped supply, prompting Healy to declare that ‚Äúthe acceptance has been incredible. It is very gratifying.‚ÄùStokes, ‚ÄúA Brewer Takes a Stand to Beat the Bland,‚Äù 20 Sep. 1985 [Section 5]: 1. By the end of its first summer, Hibernia employment had risen to 30 workers, and sales figures for June through August were 200 percent higher than for the same period a year earlier. Ultimately, Hibernia brewed 26,000 barrels of beer in 1985, a 13 percent increase in output over that registered by Walter in 1984. A total production goal of 30,000 barrels‚Äîslightly above break-even‚Äîwas set for 1986, with a rise to 87,000 barrels foreseen by 1989.Stokes, ‚ÄúA Brewer Takes a Stand to Beat the Bland,‚Äù 20 Sep. 1985 [Section 5]: 3; and Peg Masterson, ‚ÄúThe New Brewers,‚Äù Milwaukee Sentinel 6 May 1986 [Part 4]: 2. See also Ken Wysocky, ‚ÄúSpecialty Beers a Booming Trend,‚Äù Milwaukee Sentinel 3 Sep. 1985 [Part 1]: 5. Hibernia also was given excellent reviews from Michael Jackson, at the time the foremost expert on the brewing industry and the changes and trends taking place in America and how it was following in the footsteps of a similar evolution in Britain. The outcome justified the initial perspective of Healy that consumers would be willing to pay more for a better beer, under the premise that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on our way into a brewery revolution. The groundswell has already started. We have an age category in this country (28 to 40) that‚Äôs very image conscious. If they‚Äôre going to drink beer, they want to drink the best beer possible, and if that means paying $2 a bottle, they‚Äôll do it. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm banking the future of this company on.‚ÄùWysocky, ‚ÄúSpecialty Beers a Booming Trend,‚Äù 3 Sep. 1985 [Part 1]: 5. In addition to opening the brewery up to tours on weekdays, every hour from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., in July 1985, Hibernia took a large step forward in its public relations campaign by opening a seasonal beer garden in Eau Claire at the one-acre vacant lot across the street from the brewery. Employing 18 part-time workers and created in the German image of a family recreational space to drink, eat, converse, and listen to live music, it was the first new commercial beer garden in America since Prohibition. From mid-May to early October, Hibernia beers and sodas were served fresh on tap, and local polka and other bands provided regular entertainment for listening and dancing. Civic interests played a role as well: Healy recognized that Eau Claire had few tourist attractions and opening the beer garden would bring people off the highways during the peak travel season to visit town, tour the brewery, and perhaps stay overnight in the city and spend money. Local tavern owners at first vigorously opposed the Hibernia Beer Garden, but after a few weekends they realized that it brought people to a side of town they never would have visited. Area drinking establishments were doing the best business they had done in years. Since the beer garden closed at 11:00 p.m.‚Äîwith live music ending by 10:00 p.m. in deference to the interests of local residents‚Äîpatrons often were not ready to go home that early and continued to socialize in bars and restaurants located in the vicinity.Iggers, ‚ÄúForget It, Joe Six-Pack‚Äù 20 Jul. 1986: 8. See also Eric Lindquist, ‚ÄúCity Plan Panel Approves Permit for Beer Garden,‚Äù Eau Claire Leader-Telegram 5 Jun. 1985: 3A; and Masterson, ‚ÄúThe New Brewers,‚Äù 6 May 1986 [Part 4]: 1. The Hibernia Beer Garden was a priority for Healy so he could grow brewery sales and provide a distinctive outlet for its products. It also generated additional revenue that was earmarked in part toward physical improvement of the brewery facilities. Initially, Healy invested around $300,000 for advertising, building up inventory, constructing the beer garden, and undertaking general improvements to the brewery.Eric Lindquist, ‚ÄúHealy Brews Turnaround for Local Beer,‚Äù Eau Claire Leader-Telegram 22 Jun. 1985: 12A. Exterior modifications included plastering walls and demolishing an old building, while inside the brewery a more substantial change was the addition of a laboratory for quality control purposes.Don Boxmeyer, ‚ÄúBeer Barrels Roll Out Again,‚Äù St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch 2 Nov. 1985: 10B. The lab became an even more valuable asset when, around the same time, Hibernia began to perform contract brewing as another way to enhance brewery output and decrease excess capacity. Thus, in addition to its own product line, Hibernia produced unique beers and private labels for clients who did not have their own brewing facilities. The primary reasoning behind the measure was basic economics: contract brewing kept the brew kettles going during slack periods, and it utilized cooling rooms that had to cool tanks whether full or empty and took up otherwise empty storage space, all the while generating additional income. Contract brewing was becoming increasingly important to the craft industry as it allowed entry to the industry without the very expensive capital investment in a brewery. The venture was successful for the brewery, and over time Hibernia manufactured a number of specialty beers, including Newman's Albany Amber Beer, Wolf's Classic Beer and Wolf's All Malt Lager Beer, Portland Traditional Lager, Malibrew Premium Lager Beer, Griesedieck Beer (a longtime St. Louis staple brew into the 1950s),Scott Lautenschlager, ‚ÄúGriesedieck Beer Is Brought Back to Life,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 27 Aug. 1987 [Section 2]: 5. and B√ºnd Beer (for a Minnesota firm whose label used a variation of the design for Old Timer's Lager Beer, a product brewed in Eau Claire by the Walter Brewing Company during the 1970s and 1980s and briefly continued by Hibernia). In each case, the contract brews remained true to Healy's vision of making only adjunct-free all-malt beers, with recipe formulation done by Hibernia brewmasters according to input provided by clients. Hibernia also provided assistance with the potentially complicated process of getting bottle label approval from the federal government. As Healy settled into Eau Claire and became more familiar with the inner workings of the city, especially in the vicinity of the brewery, he was asked to represent the views of local residents who traditionally did not have a strong voice. Both the brewery and Healy's residence were located in the Third District, which was the poorest neighborhood in Eau Claire and included a mix of very low income residents, immigrants whose English language skills were poor or nonexistent, and retired fixed-income citizens. The bylaws of the city of Eau Claire allowed voters to cast their ballots for all members of the city council, not just their respective districts, thus Third District concerns seldom rose to the top of the city's concerns. Healy demonstrated his commitment to Eau Claire and basic fair play with his response to a group of citizens who asked him to represent the Third District in efforts to change the Eau Claire bylaws to require that only a resident of the Third District could represent the area. After citizens commented that they had no one there who was well-known or articulate enough to take on the establishment in debate, Healy agreed to help. A special election was held and the change was made after the majority won by a landslide.  Decline and closure  Within a year of its founding, Hibernia had managed to establish itself among consumers in the Upper Midwest as a brewer of quality beers. The brewery scored three honors in the Twin Cities Reader 10th Anniversary Beer Survey, including first place for Eau Claire All Malt in the Super Premium category, fifth place for Hibernia Dunkel Weizen in the Super Premium Dark competition, and ninth place for Hibernia Bock among Specialty Beers, Import and Domestic.Deborah Hopp, ‚ÄúGood to the Last Drop,‚Äù Twin Cities Reader 30 Apr. 1986: 22. Yet the success that Healy and other established small brewers increasingly demonstrated also had the net effect of enticing new brewers into the field, as the blossoming microbrewing movement began to take root in the region by the mid-1980s. As retail shelf space increasingly grew harder to acquire, and hold, Hibernia craft beer sales were challenged by a growing range of competing brews, including those from like-minded old-line brewers such as the August Schell Brewing Company (New Ulm, Minnesota) and recent arrivals including the Sprecher Brewing Company (Milwaukee) and the Capital Brewery (Middleton, Wisconsin).Masterson, ‚ÄúThe New Brewers,‚Äù 6 May 1986 [Part 4]: 1; Iggers, ‚ÄúForget It, Joe Six-Pack‚Äù 20 Jul. 1986: 6, 8. Distribution issues also proved a challenge for Hibernia in its efforts to stabilize and gain market acceptance. In rural areas and smaller cities, the higher price for Hibernia specialty made it hard to generate sales among clientele more accustomed to cheaper beer, including the home market of Eau Claire. In big cities, established distributors, accustomed to working with larger brewers with much bigger advertising budgets, were loath to take on new products without an established track record of success. With craft brewing still in its infancy, large regional and national brewers successfully used the leverage they had to persuade dealers to stay the course, at the expense of smaller producers with innovative brews. Healy summarized the dilemma that he faced in noting that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt compete directly against the big guys, with all their advertising muscle and volume-buying discounts.‚ÄùLindquist, ‚ÄúHealy Brews Turnaround for Local Beer,‚Äù 22 Jun. 1985: 12A. Despite such obstacles, over time Hibernia production improved to around 32,000 barrels and the future of the brewery seemed more secure than had been the case for almost a decade. The company had returned to modest profitability, new markets were cultivated, and employment had risen to some 35 permanent workers, with 50 at work during the busy summer season. In May 1986, Healy took an optimistic approach to the challenges that Hibernia faced, noting that ‚Äúalthough the growth has not been spectacular, it has been very steady, and that tells me I‚Äôm getting repeat business, which is the key to the whole thing.‚Äùcited in ‚Äú4 Specialty Brewers Join National Trend,‚Äù St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch 7 May 1986: 10B. Yet dark clouds remained on the horizon. While contract brewing had aided the Hibernia bottom line considerably, periodic difficulties arose in the area as well, including the loss of production for the Vienna Brewing Company in June 1986 to the Joseph Huber Brewing Company (Monroe, Wisconsin) and an open controversy over Hibernia manufacture of Treaty Beer, for resort owners and vacation business groups opposed to recognition of off-reservation harvest rights (including spearfishing) held by Native American Ojibwe in Wisconsin. When Hibernia ceased brewing Treaty Beer, the group responded by accusing the brewery of withholding royalties, proven later to be false.‚ÄúTreaty Beer Sues Brewery Over Royalties,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 21 Nov. 1987 [Section 4]: 3; ‚ÄúSpearfishing Ads Create Fuss,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 6 Apr. 1988: 2B. Much more significantly, calamity blindsided the company in late 1986 when a $100,000 shipment of underpasteurized beer was released to new markets in Ohio and California. Although the brewmaster, John Walter, and assistant brewmaster, Jake Walter, were fired immediately, and insurance covered the recall of the bad beer, the damage done to consumer confidence was insurmountable. Healy attempted to mitigate the damage by meeting with distributors and apologizing via newspaper advertisements. In September 1987, a new brewmaster, Munich native Fred Scheer, was hired away from Capital, bringing with him a wealth of brewing experience from two continents.Al Parkins and Warren Gaskill, ‚ÄúCapital Brew Strong Seller This Summer,‚Äù Capital Times 18 Aug. 1988: 14; ‚ÄúUncertain of Job Security, Hibernia Brewmaster Quits,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 19 Sep. 1988: 2B. But irreparable damage to the Hibernia name had been done in the important new sales territories, with the further consequence that word-of- mouth publicity in established markets took a toll on brewery goodwill and, ultimately, production volume. Additionally, after the initial surge of interest in 1985, Hibernia craft brew sales began to slide in the home market, and retail accounts in and around Eau Claire were not able to take up the slack from declining business elsewhere. The issue was noted by Healy in early 1988 with the frank assessment that ‚Äúthere weren‚Äôt any sales. People in Eau Claire wouldn‚Äôt support it. The worst mistake I ever made was trying to sell the beer in rural areas.‚Äù‚ÄúBrewer Vows to Keep On Brewing,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 14 Feb. 1988 [Section 3]: 2.

An ambitious plan to build restaurants with miniature breweries‚Äîessentially a chain brewpub operation‚Äîin partnership with a Schaumburg, Illinois-based firm, and in which Hibernia possessed ‚Äúthe expertise and none of the capital,‚Äù failed to materialize, and on August 24 the brewery closed, ostensibly for a short time, because it lacked truck insurance coverage.‚ÄúSudsy Deal Fizzles for Hibernia,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 19 Aug. 1988: 2B; ‚ÄúHibernia Plans Local Brew Pubs,‚Äù Wausau Daily Herald 20 Aug. 1988 [Section 3]: 1; ‚ÄúHibernia Says It Will Reopen in a Few Weeks,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 28 Aug. 1988: 2C. By early September, Scheer had left for new employment, reluctantly leaving Hibernia for stable work in Michigan at the Frankenmuth Brewery, and the First Wisconsin National Bank of Eau Claire sought to sell Hibernia, with a stated preference for doing so to someone with the intention of keeping the facility open for production. What beer remained in the brewery tanks was kept refrigerated under orders of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, under the premise that it added value to the dormant brewery.‚ÄúBank Considers Foreclosing on Brewery,‚Äù Capital Times 7 Sep. 1988: 17; ‚ÄúUncertain of Job Security, Hibernia Brewmaster Quits,‚Äù 19 Sep. 1988: 2B; ‚ÄúBank Wants to Unload Bankrupt Brewery,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 28 Sep. 1988: 6B; ‚ÄúClosed Brewery Will Still Stay Cool,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 1 Oct. 1988: 2D; ‚ÄúJudge Clears Way to Liquidate Hibernia,‚Äù Capital Times 13 Oct. 1988: 25. In fact, it was the last brew that the century-old facility ever would manufacture.  Aftermath and legacy  Although four bidders submitted offers to acquire Hibernia before the end of 1988, none realized their goal; two bids were too low and the other two could not secure financing. By spring 1989, only one group remained viable: a consortium of Minneapolis and Madison investors that sought to acquire the brewery, restore the original name of the Walter Brewing Company, and return production to the facility within two months of the purchase date. Although a purchase offer of around $550,000 was made by the group, and the sale was deemed ‚Äúlikely‚Äù by Madison media, in the end the deal was not consummated due to an inability to secure financing. In October 1989, the assets of the brewery‚Äîland, buildings, equipment, and beer brands‚Äîwere put up for sale at public auction. In just five minutes of bidding, the entire package was acquired by a dairy equipment liquidation business. But the transaction hit a roadblock in November and ultimately was held up for some six months because soil tests after the auction found a gas leak on brewery property.‚ÄúHuber on Tap; Hibernia on Hold,‚Äù Capital Times 28 Feb. 1989: 15; ‚ÄúHibernia Sale to Walter Brewing Likely,‚Äù Capital Times 17 Mar. 1989: 19; ‚ÄúNorth Dakota Man Buys Eau Claire Brewery,‚Äù Capital Times 19 Oct. 1989: 12; ‚ÄúBrewery Sale Hits Another Roadblock,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 30 Nov. 1989: 5B; ‚ÄúState/Local,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 19 May 1990: 8B. Most of the brewery equipment was disposed of in subsequent years, for use in dairy production elsewhere, and otherwise sold as scrap for pennies on the dollar. In August 1990, remaining brewery property and other assets changed hands once again, acquired by Edward Miller and Cynthia Ancil. They reopened the Hibernia Beer Garden and reintroduced Walter's Beer under its original formulation, brewed under contract by the Huber Brewing Company in Monroe and sold at local outlets in Eau Claire. With brewing no longer a viable option at the former Hibernia plant, in January 1994, Miller and Ancil put the buildings up for sale yet again. Only the real estate was made available since all remaining equipment had been removed from the facility by then.‚ÄúFormer Eau Claire Brewery Up for Sale,‚Äù Wisconsin State Journal 30 Jan. 1994: 5C. Largely unused for the next decade, the structures quickly deteriorated because of the harsh Wisconsin weather and a lack of maintenance. With some areas of the complex becoming a safety hazard, roofs leaking and collapsing, and no prospect for renovation and productive use on the horizon, most of the Walter/Hibernia brewery structures were razed in late 2005, the lone surviving building being a small bottle shop dating to 1906. The rest of the lot remained undeveloped in the years afterward. During the 1990s, the Hibernia Beer Garden closed again, this time permanently, becoming a park for city residents. The Hibernia beer brands, including Eau Claire All Malt, were not picked up by any other brewer.

It ranges from informal non-assessed community courses in schools through to undergraduate degrees and research-based postgraduate degrees. All post-compulsory education is regulated within the New Zealand Qualifications Framework, a unified system of national qualifications for schools, vocational education and training, and 'higher' education. The New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) is responsible for quality assuring all courses and tertiary education organisations other than universities. Under the Education Act 1989, The Committee on University Academic Programmes (CUAP) and the Academic Quality Agency (AQA) have delegated authority for quality assurance of university education. The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is responsible for administering the funding of tertiary education, primarily through negotiated investment plans with each funded organisation. Until 1961, all university education was organised under the University of New Zealand, with university colleges around the country. Eventually the colleges became degree- awarding universities in their own right. Tertiary institutions =Universities= Qualifications Typically, a bachelor's degree will take three years, and a further year of study will lead to an Honours degree. Not every degree follows this 3+1 pattern: there are some four-year degrees (which may or may not be awarded with Honours), and some specialist bachelor's degrees which take longer to complete. Typically, Honours may be awarded with first class, upper second class, lower second class or third class, but this can vary from degree to degree. A bachelor's degree may be followed by a master's degree. A candidate who does not hold an Honours degree may be awarded a master's degree with honours: such a degree usually involves two years study, compared to one year for a master's degree for a candidate who does have an Honours degree. A candidate who has either a master's degree or a bachelor's degree with Honours may proceed to a doctoral degree. Entrance Entry to most universities was previously \\"open\\" to all who met the minimum requirements in school-leaving examinations (be it NCEA or Bursary). However, most courses at New Zealand universities now have selective admission, where candidates have to fulfill additional requirements through qualifications, with the University of Auckland offering the largest number of selective-entry courses. Mature students usually do not need to meet the academic criteria demanded of students who enter directly from secondary school. Fees Domestic students will pay fees subsidised by the Government, and the student-paid portion of the fee can be loaned from the Government under the Government's Student Loan Scheme. Weekly stipends can be drawn from the loan for living expenses, or the student can apply for a needs based (on assessment of parental income) \\"Student Allowance\\", which does not need to be paid back. \\"Bonded Merit Scholarships\\" are also provided by the Government to cover the student-paid portion of fees. The New Zealand Scholarship is awarded to school leavers by a competitive examination and also provides financial support to school-leavers pursuing a university degree but does not entail any requirement to stay in the country after they finish university. International students pay full (non-subsidised) fees and are not eligible for Government financial assistance. Institutions The University of Otago Registry Building (completed 1879) Victoria University of Wellington's Hunter Building (completed 1906) The first university in New Zealand, the University of Otago, was founded in 1869. The next year, in 1870, the University of New Zealand was founded ‚Äì the overarching university entity which eventually had a number of university colleges under it. The University of New Zealand was initially based in Wellington, but additionally opened Canterbury College in 1873, University of Otago came under its control in 1874, Auckland University College in 1883, and later Victoria University College in 1889. The University of New Zealand system ‚Äì where it was the only degree-granting university in New Zealand ‚Äì lasted until 1961. Now the colleges are independent universities in their own right, and since 1961 four new universities have been created: Auckland University of Technology, Lincoln University, Massey University and Waikato University. Universities in New Zealand: * Auckland University of Technology (Auckland) * Lincoln University (Lincoln) * Massey University (Palmerston North, Auckland, Wellington) * University of Auckland (Auckland) * University of Canterbury (Christchurch) * University of Otago (Dunedin) * University of Waikato (Hamilton) * Victoria University of Wellington (Wellington) The overarching representative body for universities is Universities New Zealand, made up of the Vice-Chancellors of the respective institutions. According to the Education Act 1989, universities have the following characteristics: =Colleges of education= The name 'College of Education' is protected by Act of Parliament. (Previously the name 'Teachers' College' was protected.) Only universities and standalone colleges of education may use this title. Thus, privately owned institutions that are not listed in Acts and that provide teacher education such as the Bethlehem Institute (Tauranga) and New Zealand Graduate School of Education (Christchurch) must use alternative names. Below is a partial list of historical or existing colleges‚Äîspecifically those listed in Acts of Parliament as public (Crown-owned) teacher education providers: * Auckland College of Education (Auckland City) * Massey University College of Education (Palmerston North) * Wellington College of Education (Wellington) * Christchurch College of Education (Christchurch) * Dunedin College of Education (Dunedin) Most colleges of education in New Zealand in the past 30 years have gradually consolidated (for example, Ardmore with Auckland), with the trend in the last 15 years to consider and effect mergers with universities closely allied to them, for example, the Hamilton and Palmerston North colleges amalgamated with Waikato and Massey respectively. In the 2004‚Äì2005 period, the Auckland and Wellington colleges merged with Auckland University and Victoria University respectively. In 2007, the Christchurch College of Education merged with the University of Canterbury. The remaining stand-alone college in Dunedin merged with the University of Otago in January 2007. =Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITP)= Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITP) offer general technical and vocational education, as well as undertaking applied research. Most learners study vocational programmes at levels 1-6 of the NZQF, but following education reforms during the 1990s ITPs have been permitted to offer degree and postgraduate programmes, and are increasingly active in this space - including a small number of doctorates. The vocational qualifications offered by ITPs are developed by Industry Training Organisations, but they are free to set their own curricula and assessments. These are generally based on practical knowledge in a working environment, and learning may take place in classrooms, simulated work environments, external workplaces, or a combination of these. Certification upon graduation is industry-related and real work experiences are often part of the curriculum. The peak body for this sector is New Zealand Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (NZITP) . On 1 August, the Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government would merge all 16 institutes of technology and polytechnics (ITPs) into a single entity in April 2020, citing declining student numbers and better allocation of government resources. Polytechnics have been cautiously optimistic about the changes despite concerns about losing their autonomy to a national organisation. While Ara Institute of Canterbury chief executive Tony Gray and Otago Polytechnic chief executive Phil Ker have cautiously welcomed the changes, the opposition National Party's Education spokesperson Shane Reti and Southern Institute of Technology CEO Penny Simonds have opposed the merger, saying that it would lead to job losses. =WƒÅnanga= A wƒÅnanga is a publicly owned tertiary institution that provides education in a MƒÅori cultural context. Section 162 of the Education Act 1989section 162 of the Education Act 1989 (re-affirmed by the Waitangi Tribunal in 2005) specifies that wƒÅnanga resemble mainstream universities in many ways. , wƒÅnanga offer certificates, diplomas, and bachelor-level degrees, with some wƒÅnanga providing programmes in specialized areas up to doctorate level. WƒÅnanga educational programmes are accredited through the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) and the Ministry of Education, and are partly governed by New Zealand's Tertiary Education Commission (TEC). In Maori tradition the word wƒÅnanga conveyed meanings related to highly evolved knowledge, lore, occult arts, and also \\"forum\\" in the sense of a discussion to arrive at deeper understanding. Recognised wƒÅnanga in New Zealand * Te WƒÅnanga o Raukawa * Te Whare WƒÅnanga o AwanuiƒÅrangi * Te WƒÅnanga o Aotearoa Other tertiary education organisations =Private Training Establishments= Private Training Establishments (PTEs) are privately owned firms or NGOs that provide training, usually in a specific niche such as tourism, design or ICT. They also provide training to special needs groups or in time frames that support different learner needs, and a significant number offer English language teaching. Their tutors are generally drawn from industry rather than academia and the goal for most learners is to reach employment quickly. It has been argued that private trainers have the ability to respond quickly to the changing needs of industry. Most providers provide courses that are NZQA-accredited; these usually lead to certificates and diplomas, although a small number of PTEs also offer degrees. PTE programmes that are NZQA-approved receive government funding subsidies, and students in these programmes are able to access the public student financial support system. Private trainers offer an alternative to state schools and many learners prefer the supportive environment of most private trainers. Several peak bodies represent this sector, including Independent Tertiary Education New Zealand, Quality Tertiary Institutions, and English New Zealand. =Industry training organisations= Industry Training Organisations (ITOs) are established under the Industry Training and Apprenticeships Act 1992 to set skill standards and establish training arrangements for a given industry or set of related industries. To do this they develop and maintain competency-based Assessment Standards and qualifications related to their industry, and co-ordinate apprenticeships and other structured training for employees (which may involve on-job learning, off-job courses at another tertiary organisation, or a mix of both). This enables employees to gain a qualification from the New Zealand Qualifications Framework while being in a full-time job. From 2001 to 2014 they also had a formal role to provide skills leadership for their industry or industries, but this was removed by the National Government following a review of industry training ordered by then-Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, and Employment Steven Joyce. ITOs are the only organisations permitted to develop non-degree vocational qualifications, with a few specific exceptions in areas such as adult teaching. However, individual tertiary providers (including ITPs, PTEs, and wƒÅnanga) are able to develop their own programmes and curricula that lead toward those qualifications. Uniquely in comparison to similar bodies in other countries, such as the United Kingdom's Sector Skills Councils or Australia's Industry Skills Councils, ITOs work with individual firms and trainees to directly enrol learners and often manage assessments. ITOs are owned by industries, recognised under statute, and receive funding from both government and industry. Rather than being established directly by government, they exist as independent organisations and must apply for recognition as an ITO from the Minister of Education; as part of this process they must demonstrate they have sufficient support from the industry for which they claim coverage. Each ITO has to regularly reapply for recognition, and industries can decide that their skill needs are best-served by joining with one or more other ITOs. This means that the number of industry training organisations can change over time, and has fluctuated from a high of 52 in 1996 to 11 in 2019. ITOs currently cover most of New Zealand's industries from traditional trades like building and plumbing, the primary industries, and manufacturing, through to retail, government, and community services. The Industry Training Federation represents ITOs. On 1 August 2019, Education Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the Government would be replacing the eleven industrial training organisations with four to seven workforce development councils that would be set up by 2022 to influence vocational education and training. ITOs had opposed the Government's proposed merger, claiming that it would damage an already working system. Building and Construction Industry Training Organisation chief executive Warwick Quinn described the Government's decision as disappointing. Garry Fisseden, CEO of The Skills Organisation, also spoke out against the merger proposal, saying that ITOs played an essential role in bridging the communication gap between industry and learning organisations. Funding Funding for tertiary education in New Zealand is through a combination of government subsidies and student fees. The government funds approved courses by a bulk grant (the Student Achievement Component) based on the number of enrolled students in each course and the amount of study time each course requires. Courses are rated on an equivalent full-time Student (EFTS) basis. Specific funding for each individual organisation is negotiated with the Tertiary Education Commission and established through an Investment Plan that allocates funding over a rolling triennium. Students enrolled in NZQA-approved courses at providers can access student loans and student allowances to assist with fees and living costs. Industry Training is funded differently than other forms of tertiary education. A separate pool of funding - the Industry Training Fund - is used to support training and apprenticeships organised through ITOs, and this system is based on a Standard Training Measure (STM) rate that is considerably lower than per-EFTS rates for courses in the same field and at the same level. The difference in per-learner funding levels between provider- based and ITO-based tertiary education has been a considerable source of tension since the establishment of the industry training system. Apprentices and trainees learning through ITOs are unable to access student financial support (both allowances and loans), on the basis that they are full-time employees earning a wage or salary. Funding for tertiary institutions has been criticised recently due to high fees and funding not keeping pace with costs or inflation. Some also point out that high fees are leading to skills shortages in New Zealand as high costs discourage participation and graduating students seek well paying jobs off shore to pay for their student loans debts. As a result, education funding has been undergoing an ongoing review in recent years. =Students= Most tertiary education students rely on some form of state funding to pay for their tuition and living expenses. Mostly, students rely on state provided student loans and allowances. Secondary school students sitting the state run examinations are awarded scholarships, depending on their results, that assist in paying some tuition fees. Universities and other funders also provide scholarships or funding grants to promising students, though mostly at a postgraduate level. Some employers will also assist their employees to study (full-time or part-time) towards a qualification that is relevant to their work. People who receive state welfare benefits and are retraining, or returning to the workforce after raising children, may be eligible for supplementary assistance, however students already in full or part-time study are not eligible for most state welfare benefits. Over the term of the fifth National Government (2008-2017), considerable changes were made to the tertiary education sector.The New Zealand Union of Students Associations has compiled a list of all the changes made by the National Government. See students.org.nz In 2017, following the election of the sixth Labour-led Government, Minister of Education Chris Hipkins introduced an entitlement of one year's fees-free tertiary education for all New Zealand school leavers. This entitlement applies to New Zealand citizens or permanent residents who have not yet undertaken post-compulsory education at Level 3 or above of the Qualifications Framework. It covers fees for any study at Level 3 or above, including apprenticeships, provider-based vocational education, or degree-level study; it does not contribute to living costs. Student allowances Student Allowances, which are non-refundable grants to students of limited means, are means tested and the weekly amount granted depends on residential and citizenship qualifications, age, location, marital status, dependent children as well as personal, spousal or parental income. The allowance is intended for living expenses, so most students receiving an allowance will still need a student loan to pay for their tuition fees. Student loans The Student Loan Scheme is available to all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. It covers course fees, course related expenses, and can also provide a weekly living allowance for full-time students. The loan must be repaid at a rate dependent on income and repayments are normally recovered via the income tax system by wage deductions. Low income earners and students in full-time study can have the interest on their loans written off. On 26 July 2005, the Labour Party announced that they would abolish interest on Student Loans, if re-elected at the 2005 general election, which they were. From April 2006, the interest component on Student Loans was abolished for students who live in New Zealand. This has eased pressure on the government from current students. However, it has caused resentment from past students many of whom have accumulated large interests amounts in the years 1992‚Äì2006. The National Party initially opposed the interest free loans policy, but after it lost the 2005 election, in early 2008 said it would keep interest off student loans. The Fifth National Government kept interest off loans, but increased the repayment rate from 10 to 12 per cent and reduced eligibility for the loans. Unions and students' associations  =Tertiary Education Union= The New Zealand Tertiary Education Union (TEU) (in Maori: Te Haut≈´ Kahurangi o Aotearoa) is the main union in the tertiary education sector, and represents the interests of more than 10,000 workers employed sector across New Zealand. Its membership includes teachers and workers employed in all occupations in universities, polytechnics, institutes of technology, wƒÅnanga, other tertiary education providers and allied organisations. =Student associations= There are a large number of student associations in New Zealand. The system of student associations operated on the basis of compulsory membership until 2012, after ACT MP Heather Roy's voluntary student membership bill was passed in 2011. A large number belong to the New Zealand Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA). The parallel overarching student association for MƒÅori is Te Mana ƒÄkonga, the National MƒÅori Students' Association. Most universities have a student association, and some have additional MƒÅori and Pacific student associations which generally work in parallel with the main association. =Other nationwide student bodies= In addition to the main students' associations at each institution, there are also a number of other student bodies, which include: * Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA) * Every Nation Campus Ministries (ENCM) * Student Life New Zealand (Christian students' association) * Tertiary Students Christian Fellowship * UniQ (association of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, takataapui and intersex students) * University Sport New Zealand * New Zealand Law Students' Association (NZLSA) * Student Job Search (SJS) * New Zealand Medical Students' Association (NZMSA) See also *Academic ranks in New Zealand *Aotearoa New Zealand Tertiary Chaplaincy Association *Education in New Zealand References External links *Tertiary Education Commission *Tertiary education section of the Ministry for Education's website *Tertiary Education Union *Occupation Outlook Category:Education in New Zealand Category:Higher education by country ","title":"Tertiary education in New Zealand"},{"id":"43678048","text":"Telrad Networks Ltd. is an Israeli company focused on 4G telecommunications.(12 November 2013) ‚ÄúTelrad Networks Launches New LTE Advanced Base Station Platform‚Äù Yahoo!

Sixteen people‚Äîthirteen traditional Sikhs and three Nirankari followers‚Äîwere killed in the ensuing violence. Clashes occurred when some Akhand Kirtani Jatha and Damdami Taksal members led by Fauja Singh protested against and tried to stop a convention of Sant Nirankari Mission followers. This incident is considered to be a starting point in the events leading to Operation Blue Star and the 1980s insurgency in Punjab. Background Nirankari, a movement within Sikhism, started in the 19th century. Their belief in a living guru as opposed to the scriptural guru Guru Granth Sahib resulted in their difference with traditional Sikhs, though they were tolerated. A Nirankari hymn-singer, Boota Singh, had been removed from his paid duties due to \\"personal lapses\\" considered incongruous in a missionary organization, and in 1929 tried and failed to set up a rival organization in Peshawar, nominating his devotee Avtar Singh, a bakery shop owner, as his successor in 1943. Without having established any significant religious base, Avtar Singh moved to Delhi after partition, getting his group registered as the \\"Sant Nirankaris\\" in 1948. His son Gurbachan Singh succeeded him in 1963, and tensions with the Sikhs escalated as he subsequently proclaimed himself as a godman and incarnation of Guru Nanak, styling himself as bajaanwala (master of the hawk) an epithet of Guru Gobind Singh, using the names of the Sikh Gurus for his servants, and coming out with publications like the Avtar Bani, which made derogatory references to the Guru Granth Sahib of the Sikhs; a story in the Yug Purush narrated that, unlike the prophets of the world's major religions, refused to go back to earth to \\"spread God‚Äôs message\\", except for Avtar Singh, who decided to do so \\"only after God agreed that anyone blessed by him would go to heaven irrespective of worldly deeds\\". Sacrilegious versions of Sikh rituals, including administering to his sat sitare, or seven stars, his version of the Panj Piare of Guru Gobind Singh, \\"charan amrit\\", the water used to wash his feet, in place of the amrit, or holy water mixed with sugar by a steel blade, as dictated by Guru Gobind Singh for the Amrit Sanchar. Clashes between the Sikhs and the Sant Nirankaris took place beginning in the early 1950s, and tensions simmered through the 1960s, during which the Damdami Taksal came to the forefront to counter Sant Nirankari influence, as well as the Akhand Kirtani Jatha at many places in Punjab. The Akalis claimed that the Sant Nirankaris were supported by the Congress to divide and undermine the Sikh community, while many Sikhs suspected that the Nirankaris were aided and abetted by the central government and the urban Hindu elite in Punjab, who were the base of the Jan Sangh, the Akali Dal's coalition partner, and from whom the Sant Nirankaris received donations from, and hence why the Akalis had permitted the convention. This reported continuous support of the organization by the central government was also evidenced by the fact that, during a very short span, the Sant Nirankaris established 354 branches: 27 abroad and the rest in India, with large amounts of property. The organization created a para-military branch called the Seva Dal, with a membership of over 7,000, headed by a commander, called a Mukhya Shishak. The Akali Dal's Janata allies warned the Akalis not to intervene in the growing tensions on the pretext of \\"religious freedom\\", against the wishes of a large section of the Sikh community. Gurbachan Singh had met prime minister Morarji Desai who gave him assurances; major Sikh leaders, including Jagdev Singh Talwandi and Gurcharan Singh Tohra, responded by telling the press and government not to meddle in the \\"internal affairs\\" of the Sikhs by commenting on hukamnamas. Incident On 13 April 1978, the day to celebrate the birth of Khalsa, a Sant Nirankari convention headed by their leader Gurbachan Singh was organized in Amritsar, with permission from the Akali state government. While the original Nirankaris, founded in the nineteenth century with a focus on mysticism, coexisted peacefully with mainstream Sikh tradition despite its differences, the practices of the \\"Sant Nirankaris\\" subsect was considered as heretics by the orthodox Sikhism expounded by Bhindranwale, as they had begun to revere their new founder and successors as gurus and added their own scriptures to the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, with Gurbachan Singh comparing himself to Guru Gobind Singh, saying that he would create the \\"sat sitaras\\" (seven stars) to complement the Panj Piare. The government's approval of the new sect's convention in Amritsar in 1978 was particularly galling to orthodox Sikhs, as it fell on 13 April, the founding day of the Khalsa; some felt that the entire Sant Nirankari episode had been provoked on purpose by the central government to destabilize and disunify Sikhs, given its sudden rapid growth in the 1960s, and the unusual composition of converts to the sect, with a preponderance of either gazetted officers and deputy commissioners that could allot land, and the extremely poor as followers they attracted with their wealth, meant that the breakaway sect was being manipulated to undercut the power of Sikhism in the state by the central government at the time, part of what was believed to be constant attempts to \\"divide and destroy\\" Sikhism. From the Golden Temple premises, Bhindranwale delivered an angry sermon in which he declared that he would not allow this convention and would \\"go there and cut them to pieces.\\" A procession of about two hundred Sikhs led by Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, which had been founded by Randhir Singh, who had been active in the Ghadr and independence movements and had been imprisoned by the British during that period, left the Golden Temple, heading towards the Nirankari Convention. Fauja attempted to behead Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh with his sword but was shot dead by Gurbachan's bodyguard, while Bhindranwale escaped. In the ensuing violence, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale's followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris. This event brought Bhindranwale to limelight in the media. Aftermath A criminal case was filed against sixty two Nirankaris charged with the murder of 13 Sikhs by the Akali led government in Punjab. The case was heard in the neighbouring Haryana state, and all the accused were acquitted, on the basis that they acted in self-defence. The Punjab government Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal decided to appeal the decision in punjab and haryana high court, But Indira Gandhi Dismiss the Badal Government on 17 Feb 1980 and Governor Mr Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy withdrawn the appeal from high court on 10 April 1980..Gopal Singh, A History of the Sikh People, New Delhi, World Book Center, 1988, p. 739. The case of Nirankaris received widespread support in the media and the Prime Minister Morarji Desai put the entire blame on the Sikhs; orthodox Sikhs saw this as an attempt to manipulate the sect as a way to undercut Sikhism in Punjab. Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the perceived enemies of Sikhs. A letter of authority was issued by Akal Takht to ostracize the Sant Nirankaris. A sentiment was created to justify extra judicial killings of the perceived enemies of Sikhism.Singh (1999), pp. 365‚Äì66. The chief proponents of this attitude were the Babbar Khalsa founded by the widow, Bibi Amarjit Kaur of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, whose husband Fauja Singh had been at the head of the march in Amritsar; the Damdami Taksal led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who had also been in Amritsar on the day of the outrage; the Dal Khalsa, formed with the object of demanding a sovereign Sikh state; and the All India Sikh Students Federation, which was banned by the government. On 24 April 1980, the Nirankari head, Gurbachan was murdered. Bhindranwale took residence in Golden Temple to escape arrest when he was accused of the assassination of Gurbachan Singh,India in 1984: Confrontation, Assassination, and Succession, by Robert L. Hardgrave, Jr. Asian Survey, 1985 University of California Press though the Babbar Khalsa, who opposed Bhindranwale, claimed responsibility for the killing of Nirankaris. Several of Bhindranwale's associates and relatives were arrested. The FIR named nearly twenty people involved in the murder, claimed to have had ties to Bhindranwale. A member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the Tihar Jail in Delhi. Ranjit Singh later became head of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). Ranjit Singh spent 12 years in jail as an under-trial from 1984 to 1996. Several other members of Sant Nirankari Mission were also killed later. The government and press often referred to Bhindranwale traveling with an armed retinue, though all the weapons carried were licensed, no incidents ever occurred with his escort, and no laws were broken, while on the other hand, the press never protested the fact that Gurbachan Singh himself traveled with armed men, and that in Amritsar on 13 April 1975, they fired upon an unarmed group of about 100 Sikh protestors, killing 13 and injuring another 78. The government dismissed to subsequent Sikh protests as \\"dogmatism and extremism,\\" disarming the victims instead of the protestors in 1983 by revoking Bhindranwale's licenses. During the Dharam Yudh Morcha launched in August 1982, the government response to peaceful protests involved beatings, torture in police custody, and killing of youth in extrajudicial fake encounters, particularly those in Bhindranwale's group, 113 of whom had been killed by February 1983, 140 by July 1983, and over 200 later that year, with over 2000 returning from police stations severely injured. It was under these circumstances that Bhindranwale instructed his men to defy the license revocation so that, if need arose, they could defend themselves against Nirankaris as well as the police; as police arrests on trumped-up or fabricated charges came to mean torture or death, he advised first to explain their innocence, and if that did not work, to resist. The police crackdown in the state resulted in an average of 50 youths detained and 6 six killed per week, prompting a wider acceptance of Bhindranwale's claim that the government was out to destroy the Sikhs. The People's Union for Civil Liberties, an Indian human rights group, accused the Punjab police of behaving like a \\"barbarian force.\\" In response, Akali initiatives like Rasta Roko (\\"Block the Roads\\") and Kamm Roko (Stop Work) drew massive popular support in Punjab, and seven other states supported Sikh demands for greater autonomy for Punjab and the decentralization of government power. In 1978, after the incident Akal Takht issued a Hukamnama expelling Nirankaris out of the Sikh community. Legacy Gurdwara Shaheed Ganj, Amritsar was raised in the memory of the 13 Sikhs killed in the clash. Satpal Baghi of Ferozepur in the Indian Express, notes: Even journalists partial to Congress and Indira Gandhi reported that neither Bhindranwale nor anyone with him had instigated the violence.

Home to a luxury Four Seasons resort since 2004 with rates from USD $1,400 per night, it is one of the many island resorts of the Maldives.  Geography  Landaa Giraavaru seen from the north-east = Localization = Landaa Giraavaru is one of the Maldive Islands, located in the northeast of Baa Atoll. Surrounded by a white sand beach and a wide coral reef, its waters are quiet and shallow, and shelter an important biodiversity. The closest inhabited islands are Kamadhoo in the southeast and Kudarikilu in the northwest, but there are also numerous desert islands around, such as Thiladhoo, Milhaidhoo or Madhirivaadhoo in the south, which offer as many diving sites with spectacular biodiversity. = Relief and morphology = Landaa Giraavaru is approximately 600 meters in length from east to west, and 200 meters at its maximum width; its maximum height does not exceed 2 meters. It mostly consists of sand, which makes it a motu. The beaches that surround the island are protected by a coral reef that stretches westward, in a relatively long and little wave-cut platform made of sand and coral rubble.  Flora and fauna  = Terrestrial biodiversity = Landaa Giraavaru is covered with dense tropical vegetation, including in particular takamakas, coconut palm trees and screwpines. This vegetation shelters many animal species such as geckos, frigate birds, crabs, hermit crabs, dragon lizards, butterflies and dragonflies. It is also inhabited by a big ground bird, the white-breasted waterhen (Amaurornis phoenicurus), as well as by numerous giant Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus). All these animals are perfectly harmless. = Marine biodiversity = A typical underwater landscape of Baa atoll close to Landaa Giraavaru, with a hawksbill turtle and a Maldivian clownfish in its anemone. The island is located inside the \\"Baa Atoll UNESCO Biosphere Reserve\\", designated by the UNESCO in 2011.Baa Atoll, Maldives: UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve on Visitmaldives.com. Its shallow waters, particularly rich in coral, fish and an important population of whale sharks and manta rays have gained the atoll a reputation for exceptional diving. The ecosystem is characterized by a very high cover rate coral, very diverse and dominated by several species of tabular, branching or digitate corals of the genus Acropora. In addition to a high number of pelagics, the surrounding waters shelter many large marine animals such as sea turtles, dolphins, moray eels, tuna and groupers. This atoll is also famous for important populations of spectacular big animals such as whale sharks and manta rays. = Conservation = The resort shelters its own \\"Marine Discovery Centre\\" with several full-time biologists, scientific divers and researchers, managed by local environmental organization Seamarc/Marine savers. Particular projects of focus include the care and rehabilitation of wounded animals (turtles, cetaceans), surveys of the local macrofauna (turtles, rays, whale sharks) and an ambitious program of reimplantation of coral in damaged areas (known onsite as Reefscapers), mostly funded by tourists. The MDC also provides popularization course and conferences about marine life, aimed at resort guests, local islanders and marine biology apprentices.  History  Probably discovered during the prehistory at the same time as the other islands of the Maldives, Landaa Giraavaru may have been inhabited in an intermittent way because of the low availability in fresh water, even if remains of sedentary occupation were found in the northeast of the island. This population probably migrated to the close island of Kamadhoo at the beginning of the 20th century to settle the present village there. Before the opening of the hotel, the island was only punctually inhabited by one Maldivian tribe, about 10-12 people, who exploited the coconuts and certain products of the sea thanks to a regular supply from Kudarikilu there. When Resort was opened, they were offered to stay in resort for lifetime. First man died in 2007 and left his name to the restaurant of the employees, Caf√© Umarbe. Last Man died in 2014. He was also last member of tribe which occupied Landaa Giraavaru in 1900. In November 2004, the island became home to the second Maldivian resort of the Four Seasons hotel management company, and now employs approximately 500 workers and covers the entire 178062 m2 of the island, although a wide part still remains covered by dense and semi-wild tropical vegetation.  Tourism  Resting place. The presence of the luxury resort Four Seasons Resort Maldives at Landaa Giraavaru makes this site one of the numerous island resorts of the Maldives, and it consists of 103 villas on the shore of the beach on stilts over the lagoon, eight restaurants and bars, a three-acre spa and ayurvedic retreat, a Professional Association of Diving Instructors 5-Star IDC dive centre, a marine discovery centre, many leisure and entertainment facilities, as well as a fleet of boats. The access to the island from Mal√© and its international airport distant from about 130 kilometres is via a 35-minute seaplane flight, operated by Trans Maldivian Airways, from a seaplane platform in the resort‚Äôs lagoon.

Its aim is to maintain low rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), blood borne viruses (BBVs) and HIV among sex workers and their clients in South Australia. SIN provides safer sex supplies such as condoms and lube and delivers outreach to brothels, parlours, private and street based sex workers. History SIN was formed out of the Prostitutes Association of South Australia (PASA), a group formed in 1986 by sex workers. During this time community groups from priority populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users) were being funded to deliver HIV prevention information and education within communities as part of Australia's partnership approach to HIV/AIDS. In 1987, PASA received a grant from the SA Health Commission to conduct a three-month HIV/AIDS education project with sex workers called the 'Travelling Parlour Show'. Several sex workers received training to become 'peer educators' and joined with a nurse from the sexually transmitted infections clinic and took their education and information sessions to the workplaces of sex workers across the metropolitan area of Adelaide. In 1989, PASA and the AIDS council of South Australia (ACSA) joined forces to develop an ongoing HIV/AIDS education project with the sex workers of South Australia. This project has had several name changes including 'the PASA project' and 'SWIPE' but has been known as the SA Sex Industry Network or SIN since 1994. SIN was a founding member and continues to be an active member of Scarlet Alliance. In 2013, ACSA became insolvent and SIN was temporarily closed. Scarlet Alliance supported a group of volunteer sex workers in South Australia to keep limited services going while new arrangements were negotiated with the funding bodies. The SA health department agreed to fund Scarlet Alliance to complete ACSA's original contract. Political advocacy SIN has supported Labor MP Steph Key's attempts to decriminalize prostitution in South Australia. In 2012, the decriminalisation bill was defeated by one vote.Selling sex in the city: Adelaide's illegal prostitution industry In 2017, an improved bill which had support of sex workers, the working women's centre and unions was introduced into the upper house.

She was married to an American crystallographer David Sayre (1924‚Äì2012). Her literary contributions are in short stories, the earnings from which she supported her husband during his PhD course. She achieved her lifelong educational ambition of getting a law degree in her early 50s. She ultimately became justice of the local court in Head-of-the- Harbor, New York. She was a lifelong friend of Franklin, who played a key role in the discovery of the chemical structure of DNA. A strong feminist, her 1975 book Rosalind Franklin and DNA became an exposition of the account of sexism in the scientific community on one hand, and the true genius of the British Chemist Rosalind Franklin in her contributions to molecular biology on the other hand.  Biography  Anne Sayre was \\"born on a train passing through Milwaukee\\". She spent her childhood in Woodmere, New York, and was educated at Radcliffe College. But the Second World War prevented her to pursue law, her main ambition. To render her service in the war, she worked in the Radiation Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her job there was managing the supply of special-design transformers. She never really knew what transformers were. She took the job for only a few months, but she met her future husband, David Sayre. (David Sayre was a physics student who also volunteered for war service during his academic break.) They got married in 1947. Married to a scientist, she described herself as \\"a camp-follower to the scientists\\". She soon took up a writing career, mainly of short stories, of which many were included in the Foley's and the Best American Short Stories collections. In 1949, they moved to England as David Sayre was enrolled for PhD at the University of Oxford to work under Dorothy Hodgkin (a 1964 Nobel laureate). Anne Sayre financially supported most of their financial expenses through her writings. She eventually got appointed as an editor at the Oxford University Press. David received his PhD in 1951, and in September they returned to US. In 1975, Anne revived her ambition to become a lawyer and got enrolled in New York University Law School, from where she graduated with high grades. She devoted her service in legal matters, particularly concerning environment, in Long Island. She initially served as volunteer Legal Aid lawyer in Riverhead. Later, she was appointed justice in the Head of the Harbor, a post she held until illness prompted her to resign in 1996. Since the late 1980s she had suffered from pneumonia and the complications of scleroderma, a rare form of rheumatism. She died on March 13, 1998, in a hospital near her home in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, and was survived by her husband.  Rosalind Franklin and her biography  Anne Sayre first met Rosalind Franklin in 1949 at Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'√âtat in Paris, where Franklin was working, and when she and her husband was visiting. From then on she remained one of Franklin's closest friends. While she and her husband lived in Oxford, Franklin frequently met her whenever he visited England. When they moved to US, Franklin visited them several times when she attended scientific conferences. They regularly exchanged letters when they lived apart in different continents until the end of 1957, as Franklin developed ovarian cancer. In October 1957, Franklin underwent her second operation. By that time Sayre was visiting around England and Scotland. She stayed with Franklin at the hospital and looked after Franklin's apartment. When Franklin was discharged from hospital, Sayre nursed her in a rented cottage for some days. After recovery, she left her in London and headed home to New York. This was the last time they met. On October 8, Franklin wrote to her that she was invited to a phytopathology conference at Bloomington, Indiana, and that she planned to stay with Sayre on her way in New York. This was their last communication. Franklin never fully recovered and died on April 16, 1958. Franklin's X-ray crystallography of DNA (dubbed Photo 51) was the key data in the discovery of DNA structure, for which James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins won the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. After death, Franklin was largely forgotten outside the scientific community. However, her importance surfaced when Watson published his memoir The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA in 1968. Although the DNA research centred on Franklin, Watson mostly portrayed her as \\"uninteresting\\", \\"belligerent\\", \\"sharp, stubborn mind\\", with her dresses showing \\"all the imagination of English blue- stocking adolescents\\", \\"the product of an unsatisfied mother\\", a physical bully, and always referring to her as \\"Rosy\\", the name she never appreciated. After reading the book, Sayre felt that Franklin was grossly misrepresented in her personal qualities. She called The Double Helix as \\"every known prejudice against intellectual women\\". She quickly started researching for materials, and after five years, she published Rosalind Franklin and DNA in 1975, which she claimed not as a biography, but as a protest to Watson's. These two books became the posthumous fame for Franklin. However, Sayre's book is criticised for its strong feminism, its attempt to make Franklin as a feminist icon, and wrongly representing sexism of the time.  Recognition  College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Stony Brook University, has Anne Sayre Prize for students. The prize carries $500 and a copy of Anne Sayre's book.

Accordingly, in 1947, she moved to Madras, where her eldest brother, Dr. Vishwanatha Menon was already a practising diabetologist, to join Madras Medical College from where she passed her MBBS. Though she had opportunities to start medical practice in Madras, along with her brother, Subhadra decided against it and returned to Kerala. Her career started as the assistant surgeon at the Sree Avittam Thirunal Hospital for women and children in Thiruvananthapuram, part of the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram which was in its infancy at that time. As the Medical College grew, Subhadra joined the faculty as a tutor. To further her teaching career, which required a post graduate degree to enter the mainstream teaching profession, she secured a postgraduate degree with specialisation in gynecology and obstetrics from Patna and Madras universities and soon rose up the ranks. Dr. Subhadra Nair retired from the Government service in 1984, as the Head of the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Nair was married to Gopalakrishnan Nair, a district superintendent with the Kerala Police, who has since died leaving behind two daughters, Asha Nair and Shanthi Nair. Asha Nair is settled in the UK while the younger daughter remains in Thiruvananthapuram. After retiring from the government service, Dr. Subhadra joined Cosmopolitan Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram as consultant surgeon of gynecology, when the hospital was a small-time setup. The hospital has now developed into a multi- speciality hospital. Subhadra Nair lives in Pattom, Thiruvananthapuram, continuing her work as the chairman and the senior consultant of gynecology at the Cosmopolitan Hospital.

Later, she was attracted to the activities of the Sri Sathya Sai Orphanage Trust, an NGO operating in Thiruvananthapuram and started devoting her attention to the social activities of the Trust. At Sai Trust, she, along with the founding members, were able to set up a Saigramam, a village to provide shelter and support to the needy. Dr. Subhadra, personally stood guarantee for obtaining a bank loan for the construction of the village. The project has since grown to provide social, educational and medical support to a large section of people through Sainiketan (Children's home), Sayoojyam (Old age home), Sathya Sai Vidya Mandir (School), Sai Narayanalayam (Public kitchen), Navajeevanam Free Dialysis Unit and Sai Care Home (centre for differently gifted people).

Approximately five million people visit the Great Barrier Reef each year. According to the WWF, tourism of the area contributes $5.4 billion a year to the Australian economy, and employs approximately 69,000 people. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg sees the key competitive advantage of the Great Barrier Reef as opposed to other, closer, reef tourism destinations is the region's reputation as being \\"the most pristine coral reef on the planet\\". The GBRMPA states that careful management, which includes permits for camping and all commercial marine tourism within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, has so far ensured that tourists have a very minimal impact on the reef. History Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s. The earliest known tourism in the region took place on Green Island in the 1890s. In the early 20th century, scientific field expeditions became popular in the region, which laid the groundwork for tourism. Another tourist activity that was briefly popular was visiting Aboriginal missions, but this was clamped down upon by the missionaries who disapproved of the tourists giving money and goods to the Aboriginals. Torres Strait Islanders relocated south to the Whitsundays to demonstrate turtle hunting and performed songs and dances for tourists. In 1931, The Morning Bulletin called for increased awareness of tourism in the area, extolling the game fish that could be caught in the region. Tourism largely stopped during World War II. During the 1960s and 1970s, tourist numbers grew steadily, and transport improved and boats that extended day trips to between 15 and 20 nautical miles were invented. The remoteness of several parts of the Great Barrier Reef had naturally prevented access and therefore human impacts. In 1981, the Great Barrier Reef was inscribed on the world heritage list. Tourism is regarded to be an important way that Australia can fulfill its duty to present the Great Barrier Reef in accordance with the world heritage convention. In the 1980s, tourism in the Great Barrier Reef region expanded rapidly.Moscardo G, Saltzer R, Galletly A, Burke A, Hildebrandt A. 2003. Changing Patterns of Reef Tourism. CRC Reef Research Centre Technical Report No. 49, CRC Reef Research Centre, Townsville. https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.reef.crc.org.au/publications/techreport/pdf/Technical%20Report%2049.pdf At one point during the 1980s, a floating hotel operated. As of 1987, 450,000 tourists visited. Skeat and Skeat attribute the growth in tourist numbers during the 1980s to improved air access to regional areas, including the Cairns International Airport, and large catamarans which allowed day trips of 50 nautical miles. During the 1980s, there was concern that tourism was harming the reef. The disappearance of Tom and Eileen Lonergan in 1998 while scuba diving off the Great Barrier Reef caused the Queensland government to commission a task force to review the workplace health and safety standards of recreational diving and snorkelling. Tourism briefly dipped in 2006 due to competing overseas events such as the FIFA World Cup.Annual Queensland Economic Report The 2008 financial crisis saw a reduction in both international travellers and business travellers, with the later group declining by 9% in 2009 compared to the previous year. After the 2010‚Äì2011 Queensland floods many travellers cancelled trips to the state, resulting in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. The Reserve Bank deputy governor Philip Lowe stated in February 2012 that tourism in Australia is having undergo structural changes because of a contraction in the sector due to the impact of a high Australian dollar. By 2012, the estimated value of tourism in the Great Barrier Reef region had reached $5.5 billion. In the wake of Cyclone Marcia, a marketing campaign urged people to visit the region to help it recover. In response to the coral bleaching event of 2016, where only 7% of the reef was unaffected, the tourism industry created a hashtag, #GBRtoday showing healthy corals. Also in 2016, the Australian government asked for a chapter on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef to be removed from UNESCO's report on the status of the Great Barrier Reef over concerns it could impact on tourism. Domestic tourism to the reef subsequently fell. Locations As of 2003, 85% of tourism in the region was concentrated in Cairns and the Whitsunday areas of the Marine Park. =Vessel-based tourism operations= Vessel-based tourism operations can serve from 10 to over 400 people. Extended vessel-based tourism operations can last for weeks and move between different sites. Safety The disappearance of Tom and Eileen Lonergan in 1998 while scuba diving off the Great Barrier Reef caused the Queensland government to commission a task force to review the workplace health and safety standards of recreational diving and snorkelling. In 2003, Gabe Watson and his wife Tina were dive buddies on an expedition, despite Tina's inexperience. Tina drowned and Watson was subsequently convicted of manslaughter. In 2008, another two tourists were left behind, and had to tread water for 19 hours. In 2011, another tourist was left snorkelling and had to swim to another boat. Types of tourists A survey conducted in 2003 found that visitors to the Whitsundays were likely to be first-time visitors to the Great Barrier Reef, had an average age of 37, were mainly international visitors, were likely to be visiting with a partner or their family, and were likely to have taken part in snorkelling, swimming, or taking part on a semi- submersible tour. A report in 1995 found that tourists expected to see beautiful islands and beaches, to experience a \\"natural, unspoilt environment\\", and to see a variety of fish and corals, and compare their experience with idealised tourist advertising. A report in 1999 found that older tourists participated in fewer activities at the Great Barrier Reef, and urged caution in considering them a lucrative market. A 2003 paper discussed the patterns of repeat visitors to the GBR region. It found that they were younger, likely to be backpackers or interstate tourists, if they were international visitors they were likely to be from North America or Europe, more likely to go diving, and more likely to seek smaller, specialised operations for their return visit. A survey in 2015 found that two thirds of tourists wanted to see the Great Barrier Reef before it was gone. Management and regulations The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 is one of the major laws governing the management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. When it was passed, the management of tourism was seen as an important issue. Ros Kelly proposed a 1% tax on tourism activities in the GBR in 1991, but this was criticised by Queensland's premier, Wayne Goss. All licensed tourism operations in the Marine Park must pay the Environmental Management Charge (EMC), introduced in 1993,Harriott, VJ. 2002.

The company claims to improve cognitive abilities. Background and history The company was founded by Ken Gibson who started the first LearningRx in August 2002 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The first franchise had $250,000 in revenue in its initial four months. Other LearningRx franchises were opened in 2003; 27 were started that year. The company says its teaching methods are grounded in founder Ken Gibson and his brother Keith Gibson's experience. As of 2016 the company says its games are \\"designed by scientists to challenge core cognitive abilities;\\" prior to that, according to the FTC, it had \\"deceptively claim[ed] their programs were clinically proven to permanently improve serious health conditions like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and concussions\\". Legal matters Starting in January 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued other companies selling \\"brain training\\" programs or other products intended to improve cognitive function, including WordSmart Corporation, the company that makes Lumosity, and Brain Research Labs (which sold dietary supplements) for deceptive advertising. Later that year the FTC also sued LearningRx in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado in Denver for similar reasons. The FTC said LearningRx made unproven assertions in its marketing materials that clinical trials had demonstrated LearningRx helped increase people's IQ and income and mitigated clients' medical issues. In its lawsuit, the FTC said LearningRx had been \\"deceptively claim[ing] their programs were clinically proven to permanently improve serious health conditions like ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and concussions\\". LearningRx had made these claims on its website, Facebook, Twitter, advertising mail, as well as in advertisements in newspapers and on radio. In 2016, LearningRx settled with the FTC by agreeing not to make the disputed assertions unless they had \\"competent and reliable scientific evidence\\" which was defined as randomized controlled trials done by competent scientists. For the judgment's monetary component, LearningRx agreed to pay $200,000 of a $4 million settlement. Reception The \\"brain training\\" field has been controversial in the scientific community; in 2014 a group of 75 scientists put out a statement saying that most claims made by companies in the field were pseudoscience, which was countered several months later by an industry-organized group of scientists who said that there was evidence for their effectiveness. In 2012 Douglas K. Detterman of the Case Western Reserve University said that the program's exercises help improve skills in tests conducted by the institution itself but not improvement on skills in general and that the studies conducted by commercial services that support their claims of benefits are poorly done.

Style Lam described Wild City as belonging to a \\"City Trilogy\\" along with the films City on Fire and Full Alert.

It was one of the largest single mass lynchings in American history. The lynching took place the day after the trial of nine of the nineteen men indicted in Hennessy's murder. Six of these defendants were acquitted, and a mistrial was declared for the remaining three because the jury failed to agree on their verdicts. There was widespread suspicion in the city that an Italian network of criminals was responsible for the killing of the police chief, in a period of anti-Italian sentiment and rising crime. Believing the jury had been bribed, a mob broke into the jail where the men were being held and killed eleven of the prisoners, most by shooting. The mob outside the jail numbered in the thousands and included some of the city's most prominent citizens. American press coverage of the event was largely congratulatory, and those responsible for the lynching were never charged. The incident had serious national repercussions. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte in New Orleans registered a protest and left the city in May 1891 at his government's direction. The New York Times published his lengthy statement charging city politicians with responsibility for the lynching of the Italians.\\"Signor Corte's Farewell/His Story of the Lynching of the Italians\\", New York Times, 24 May 1891; accessed 5 February 2018 Italy cut off diplomatic relations with the United States, sparking rumors of war. Increased anti- Italian sentiment led to calls for restrictions on immigration. The word \\"Mafia\\" entered the American lexicon, and the stereotype of the Italian mafioso became established in the popular imagination of Americans. The lynchings were the subject of the 1999 HBO movie Vendetta, starring Christopher Walken. The movie is based on a 1977 history book of the same name by Richard Gambino. Background =Anti-Italian sentiment in New Orleans= In late 19th-century America, there was a growing prejudice against Italians, although they were recruited to satisfy the demand for cheap labor. They were immigrating to the American South, particularly Florida and Louisiana, in large numbers because of poor conditions at home and to fill the shortage of cheap labor created by the end of slavery and the preference of freedmen to work on their own accounts as sharecroppers. Sugar planters, in particular, sought workers who were more compliant than former slaves; they hired immigrant recruiters to bring Italians to southern Louisiana. In the 1890s, thousands of Italians were arriving in New Orleans each year. Many settled in the French Quarter, which by the early 20th century became known as \\"Little Sicily.\\" In a letter responding to an inquiry about immigration in New Orleans, Mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare expressed the common anti-Italian prejudice, complaining that the city had become attractive to \\"...the worst classes of Europe: Southern Italians and Sicilians...the most idle, vicious, and worthless people among us.\\" He claimed they were \\"filthy in their persons and homes\\" and blamed them for the spread of disease, concluding that they were \\"without courage, honor, truth, pride, religion, or any quality that goes to make a good citizen.\\" =Assassination of David Hennessy= Artist's conception of Hennessy's murder. \\"Scene of the Assassination\\", The Mascot, New Orleans, 1890. On the evening of October 15, 1890, New Orleans police chief David Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor, \\"Dagoes\\" (a derogatory term for Italians and others of Mediterranean heritage). Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting, and spoke to friends, but did not name the shooters. The next day complications set in and he died. There had been an ongoing feud between the Provenzano and MantrangaAlso spelled \\"Matranga\\" in some documents. families, who were business rivals on the New Orleans waterfront. Hennessy had put several of the Provenzanos in prison, and their appeal trial was coming up. According to some reports, Hennessy had been planning to offer new evidence at the trial that would clear the Provenzanos and implicate the Mantrangas. If true, this would mean that the Mantrangas, and not the Provenzanos, had a motive for the murder. A policeman who was a friend of Hennessy's later testified that Hennessy had told him he had no such plans. In any case, it was widely believed that Hennessy's killers were Italian. Local papers such as the Times-Democrat and the Daily Picayune freely blamed \\"Dagoes\\" for the murder. =Investigation= The murder was quickly followed by mass arrests of local Italians. Mayor Joseph A. Shakspeare (according to the Picayune) told the police to \\"scour the whole neighborhood. Arrest every Italian you come across.\\" Within 24 hours, 45 people had been arrested. By some accounts, as many as 250 Italians were rounded up. Most were eventually released for lack of evidence. Local Italians were afraid to leave their homes for several days after the murder, but eventually the furor died down and they returned to work. Nineteen men were ultimately charged with the murder or as accessories and held without bail in the Parish Prison. These included Charles Mantranga, who was charged with plotting the murder, and several of the Mantranga's friends and workers. Pietro Monasterio, a shoemaker, was arrested because he lived across the street from where Hennessy was standing when he was shot. Antonio Marchesi, a fruit peddler, was arrested because he was a friend of Monasterio's and \\"was known to frequent his shoe shop.\\" Emmanuele Polizzi was arrested when a policeman identified him as one of the men he had seen running from the scene of the crime. A few days after Hennessy's death, Mayor Shakspeare gave a speech declaring that Hennessy had been \\"the victim of Sicilian vengeance\\" and calling upon the citizenry to \\"teach these people a lesson they will not forget.\\" He appointed a Committee of Fifty to investigate \\"the existence of secret societies or bands of oath-bound assassins...and to devise necessary means and the most effectual and speedy measures for the uprooting and total annihilation\\" of any such organizations. On October 23, the committee published an open letter to the Italian community encouraging them to inform on each other anonymously. The letter ended on a menacing note: > We hope this appeal will be met by you in the same spirit in which we issue > it, and that this community will not be driven to harsh and stringent > methods outside of the law, which may involve the innocent and guilty > alike...Upon you and your willingness to give information depends which of > these courses shall be pursued. The letter was signed by the Committee's chairman, Edgar H. Farrar, who later served as president of the American Bar Association. Other prominent members of the Committee included General Algernon S. Badger, Judge Robert C. Davey, politician Walter C. Flower, Colonel James Lewis, and architect Thomas Sully. The Committee of Fifty hired two private detectives to pose as prisoners and try to get the defendants to talk about the murder. Apparently the detectives did not obtain any useful information, because they were not asked to testify at the trial. Only Polizzi, who appeared to be mentally ill, said anything to incriminate himself, and his confession was deemed inadmissible. Meanwhile, the defendants were subject to extremely negative pretrial publicity. Across the country, newspapers ran headlines such as \\"Vast Mafia in New Orleans\\" and \\"1,100 Dago Criminals\\". Several shotguns were found near the scene of the crime. One was a muzzle-loading shotgun, a type which was widely used in New Orleans and throughout the South, but which police claimed was a \\"favorite\\" of Italians. Another had a hinged stock. Local newspapers reported that such guns were imported from Italy; in fact they were manufactured by the W. Richards Company. Spurred to action by the popular accounts of Hennessy's murder, a 29-year-old newspaper salesman named Thomas Duffy walked into the prison on October 17, 1890, sought out Antonio Scaffidi, whom he had heard was a suspect, and shot him in the neck with a revolver. Scaffidi survived the attack, only to be lynched a few months later. Duffy was eventually convicted of assault and sentenced to six months in prison. =Murder trial= A trial for nine of the suspects began on February 16, 1891, and concluded on March 13, 1891, with Judge Joshua G. Baker presiding. The defendants were represented by Lionel Adams of the law firm Adams and O'Malley, and the state by district attorney Charles A. Luzenberg. Jury selection was a time-consuming process: Hundreds of prospective jurors were rejected before 12 people were found who were not opposed to capital punishment, were not openly prejudiced against Italians, and were not of Italian descent themselves. Much of the evidence presented at trial was weak or contradictory. The murder had taken place on a poorly lit street on a damp night, in a notoriously corrupt city, and the eyewitness testimony was unreliable. Suspects were identified by witnesses who had not seen their faces, but only their clothing. Captain Bill O'Connor, the witness who claimed to have heard Hennessy blame \\"Dagoes\\" for the assassination, was not called to testify. There were numerous other discrepancies and improprieties. At one point, two employees of the defense law firm were arrested for attempting to bribe prospective jurors. Afterward, when federal district attorney William Grant looked into the case, he reported that the evidence against the men was \\"exceedingly unsatisfactory\\" and inconclusive. He could find no evidence linking any of the lynched men to the Mafia, or to any attempts to bribe the jury. The bribery charges were eventually dismissed. Mantranga and another man, Bastian Incardona, were found not guilty by directed verdict, as no evidence had been presented against them. The jury declared four of the defendants not guilty, and asked the judge to declare a mistrial for the other three, as they could not agree on a verdict. The six who were acquitted were not released, but were held pending an additional charge of \\"lying in wait\\" with intent to commit murder. Luzenberg admitted that without a murder conviction, he would be forced to drop the \\"lying in wait\\" charges. But all nine men were returned to the prison‚Äîa decision which would prove fatal for some of them. The jurors were given the option to leave by a side door, but chose to walk out the front door and face the angry crowd. Several defended their decision to reporters, arguing that they had \\"reasonable doubt\\" and had done what they thought was right. Some were harassed, threatened, fired from their jobs, and otherwise penalized for failing to convict the Italians. =Incitement= William S. Parkerson inciting the mob. Harper's Weekly, March 28, 1891. A group of about 150 people, calling themselves the Committee on Safety (referring to the Revolutionary War era), met that evening to plan their response. The following morning an ad appeared in local newspapers calling for a mass meeting at the statue of Henry Clay, near the prison. Citizens were told to \\"come prepared for action.\\" The Daily States editorialized: > Rise, people of New Orleans! Alien hands of oath-bound assassins have set > the blot of a martyr's blood upon your vaunted civilization! Your laws, in > the very Temple of Justice, have been bought off, and suborners have caused > to be turned loose upon your streets the midnight murderers of David C. > Hennessy, in whose premature grave the very majesty of our American law lies > buried with his mangled corpse ‚Äî the corpse of him who in life was the > representative, the conservator of your peace and dignity. As thousands of demonstrators gathered near the Parish Prison, Pasquale Corte, the Italian consul in New Orleans, sought the help of Louisiana governor Francis T. Nicholls to prevent an outbreak of violence. The governor declined to take any action without a request from Mayor Shakspeare, who had gone out to breakfast and could not be reached. Meanwhile, at the Clay statue, attorney William S. Parkerson was exhorting the people of New Orleans to \\"set aside the verdict of that infamous jury, every one of whom is a perjurer and a scoundrel.\\" When the speech was over, the multi-racial crowd marched to the prison, chanting, \\"We want the Dagoes.\\" Lynching Inside the prison, as the mob was breaking down the door with a battering ram, prison warden Lemuel Davis let the 19 Italian prisoners out of their cells and told them to hide as best they could. Although the thousands of demonstrators outside gave the sense that the lynching was a spontaneous outburst, the killings were carried out by a relatively small, disciplined \\"execution squad\\" led by Parkerson and three other city leaders: Walter Denegre, lawyer; James D. Houston, politician and businessman; and John C. Wickliffe, editor of the New Delta newspaper. Other members of the lynch mob included John M. Parker, who was elected as Louisiana's 37th governor, and Walter C. Flower, who was elected as the 44th mayor of New Orleans. The mentally ill Polizzi was hauled outside, hanged from a lamppost, and shot. Antonio Bagnetto, a fruit peddler, was hanged from a tree and shot. Nine others were shot or clubbed to death inside the prison. The bullet-riddled bodies of Polizzi and Bagnetto were left hanging for hours. =Victims= The following people were lynched: * Antonio Bagnetto, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted. * James Caruso, stevedore: Not tried. * Loreto Comitis, tinsmith: Not tried. * Rocco Geraci, stevedore: Not tried. * Joseph P. Macheca, fruit importer: Tried and acquitted. * Antonio Marchesi, fruit peddler: Tried and acquitted. * Pietro Monasterio, cobbler: Mistrial. * Emmanuele Polizzi, street vendor: Mistrial. * Frank Romero, ward politician: Not tried. * Antonio Scaffidi, fruit peddler: Mistrial. * Charles Traina, rice plantation laborer: Not tried. The following people managed to escape lynching by hiding inside the prison: * John Caruso, stevedore: Not tried. * Bastian Incardona, laborer: Tried and acquitted. * Gaspare Marchesi, 14, son of Antonio Marchesi: Tried and acquitted. * Charles Mantranga, labor manager: Tried and acquitted. * Peter Natali, laborer: Not tried. * Charles Pietza (or Pietzo), grocer: Not tried. * Charles Patorno, merchant: Not tried. * Salvatore Sinceri, stevedore: Not tried. The court and district attorney set the survivors free after the lynching, and dropped the charges against the men who had not yet been tried. One of the victims, Polizzi, had a police record in the U.S., having reportedly cut a man with a knife in Austin, Texas, several years earlier. Two others had police records in Italy: Geraci had been accused of murder and had fled before he could be tried, and Comitz had been convicted of theft. Incardona was wanted in Italy as a petty criminal. Three of the men‚ÄîComitz, Monasterio, and Traina‚Äîhad not applied for U.S. citizenship and could still be considered Italian subjects. All of those lynched were Sicilian immigrants except for Macheca, a Louisiana native of Sicilian descent, and Comitz, who was from the Rome area. Shortly after Hennessy's death, the Daily States informed readers that the suspects were \\"a villainous looking set\\" and described their appearance in racist terms, concluding, \\"They are not Italians, but Sicilians.\\" Most anti-Italian hostility in the United States was directed at Southern Italians, particularly Sicilians. This was especially true in the American South, where Southern Italians were not considered full-fledged members of the \\"white race\\". The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction, classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races. Between 1890 and 1910, Sicilians made up less than 4 percent of the white male population, yet were roughly 40 percent of the white victims of southern lynch mobs. Before that, many white victims were ethnic Irish. They often had peripheral positions, working on construction of levees and railroads, and as farm workers. Macheca's personal history complicates this view of Sicilians as victims of white racism. He was born in 1843 to Sicilian parents in Louisiana, and adopted and raised by a Maltese man named Macheca. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate army. In 1868, either Macheca or his adoptive father led a group of Sicilians in a violent, anti-black demonstration. Although not a member of the White League, as a captain of the First Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Macheca fought in the Battle of Liberty Place on the same side as the Crescent City White League in 1874. He was the leader of a group of Sicilians who called themselves \\"The Innocents\\"; depending on the source, this group was either a murderous gang of white supremacists, a precursor to the Louisiana Mafia, or a security force hired to protect Macheca and his businesses. The racial politics are further complicated by the fact that the 1891 lynch mob included some black residents. In addition, Colonel James Lewis, a member of the elite Committee of Fifty, was a mixed-race African-American man who had been an officer in the Louisiana Native Guard and a leader in the Republican Party. Aftermath =Press coverage= Cartoon that appeared in Puck on March 25, 1891. American newspaper accounts at the time were largely sympathetic to the lynchers, and anti-Italian in tone. The victims were presumed to have been involved with the Mafia and therefore deserving of their fate. A New York Times headline announced, \\"Chief Hennessy Avenged...Italian Murderers Shot Down\\". A Times editorial the next day vilified Sicilians in general: > These sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and > assassins, who have transported to this country the lawless passions, the > cut-throat practices, and the oath-bound societies of their native country, > are to us a pest without mitigation. Our own rattlesnakes are as good > citizens as they...Lynch law was the only course open to the people of New > Orleans. Many commentators offered a pro forma condemnation of vigilantism before ultimately blaming the victims and defending the lynchers. Massachusetts representative Henry Cabot Lodge, for example, claimed to deplore the mob's behavior, and then proceeded to justify it while proposing new restrictions on Italian immigration. Even the London Times expressed approval. Not all editors were convinced of the mob's innocence. The Charleston News and Courier argued that murder by vigilantes was no more acceptable than any other kind. The St. Louis Republic wrote that the men were killed \\"on proof of being 'dagoes' and on the merest suspicion of being guilty of any other crime.\\" Some Northern newspapers also condemned the lynchings. Many others, however, implicitly or explicitly condoned them. A Boston Globe front-page headline read, \\"STILETTO RULE: New Orleans Arose to Meet the Curse.\\" Boston was another industrial city that had been receiving many immigrants from southern Italy. Following strong protests by the Italian government and the Italian-American community, the press eventually became less supportive of the lynchers. =Criminal charges= A grand jury convened on March 17, 1891, to investigate the lynching. Judge Robert H. Marr, who presided over the jury, was a longtime personal friend of several of the lynch mob participants. On May 5, 1891, the grand jury published a report concluding that several jurors in the Hennessy case had been bribed to acquit the Italians. No proof was offered and no criminal charges were pursued. The grand jury claimed that it could not identify the participants in the lynching. In the same report, the lynching was described as a \\"gathering\\" of \\"several thousands of the first, best, and even the most law-abiding, of the citizens of this city.\\" No one was indicted. Only Thomas Duffy, the newspaper salesman who had shot Scaffidi in October, was penalized. Duffy was serving time in the Parish Prison at the time of the lynching. After the Hennessy case, at least eight more men of Italian descent were lynched in Louisiana during the 1890s. In each case, as was typical of lynchings, local authorities claimed to be unable to identify anyone involved and never prosecuted anyone for the murders. =Political repercussions= The incident strained relations between the U.S. and Italy. The Italian consul Pasquale Corte left New Orleans in late May 1891 and the New York Times published his statement accusing the city politicians of responsibility for the lynchings. The Italian government demanded that the lynch mob be brought to justice and that reparations be paid to the dead men's families. When the U.S. declined to prosecute the mob leaders, Italy recalled its ambassador from Washington in protest. The U.S. followed suit, recalling its legation from Rome. Diplomatic relations remained at an impasse for over a year, and there were rumors of a declaration of war on America as a result of the murders. As part of a wider effort to ease tensions with Italy and placate Italian Americans, president Benjamin Harrison declared the first nationwide celebration of Columbus Day in 1892, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Italian explorer's landing in the New World. When President Harrison agreed to pay a $25,000 indemnity to the victims' families, Congress tried unsuccessfully to intervene against the reparations, accusing him of \\"unconstitutional executive usurpation of Congressional powers\\". The US paid $2,211.90 to each family of the eleven victims. The contrasting American and Italian attitudes toward the lynchings are perhaps best summarized by Theodore Roosevelt's comment. Roosevelt, then serving on the United States Civil Service Commission, wrote to his sister Anna Roosevelt Cowles on March 21, 1891: > Monday we dined at the Camerons; various dago diplomats were present, all > much wrought up by the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans. Personally I > think it rather a good thing, and said so. The incident has been mostly forgotten in the U.S., relegated to the footnotes of American history texts. However, it is more widely known in Italy. Mayor Shakspeare was narrowly defeated for reelection in 1892, with the Italian- American vote a decisive factor. Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who survived by hiding in the prison while his father was lynched, was awarded $5,000 in damages in 1893 after suing the city of New Orleans. The death of Hennessy became a rallying cry for law enforcement and nativists to halt the immigration of Italians into America. Henry Cabot Lodge claimed that \\"the paupers and criminals of Europe\\" were \\"pouring into the United States\\" and proposed a literacy test to keep out the poorest immigrants. The Hennessy case introduced the word \\"Mafia\\" to the American public. It generated the now- familiar stereotype of the Italian-American mafioso. Journalists of the time used the word \\"Mafia\\" loosely, to sell newspapers, often linking the crimes of individual Italians to organized crime when no evidence of such a connection existed. After the lynching, newspapers circulated wild rumors that thousands of Italian Americans were plotting to attack New Orleans, and were wrecking railroads in New York and Chicago. The press reported that the defense lawyers in the Hennessy case were paid by the Mafia, when Italian-language newspapers in cities across the country had raised funds for the men's legal defense. Soon historians were applying the \\"Mafia\\" label retroactively to crimes committed by Italians in the past. For decades after the lynching, New Orleans children of other ethnicities would taunt Italian Americans with the phrase, \\"Who killa de chief?\\" =Books and films= For the better part of a century, most historians relied on contemporary newspaper accounts as their primary sources of information about the lynching, seldom questioning the guilt of the lynched men or the popular assumption that Hennessy's murder was a Mafia assassination. In the 1970s, two studies by Italian Americans challenged the prevailing view. Humbert Nelli, a professor of history at the University of Kentucky, examines the Hennessy case in a chapter of The Business of Crime (1976). Nelli demonstrates that the evidence against the men was weak, and argues that the murder was too poorly planned and amateurish to have been a Mafia hit. In a chapter on crime in New Orleans, he claims that although crime flourished among the city's southern Italians at the time, it could not accurately be attributed to mafiosi. In Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History (1977),The original title was Vendetta: A True Story of the Worst Lynching in America, the Mass Murder of Italian- Americans in New Orleans in 1891, the Vicious Motivations Behind It, and the Tragic Repercussions that Linger to This Day. Richard Gambino, a professor at City University of New York, raises numerous questions about the investigation and trial, and proposes an alternative theory about Hennessy's murder. Among other things, Gambino notes that Hennessy had a \\"colorful\\" past that provided any number of possible motives to be subject to murder, none of which the police chose to investigate. He also notes that shortly after the lynching, the city passed an ordinance giving control of all New Orleans dock work to the newly formed Louisiana Construction and Improvement Corporation, a business headed by several of the lynch mob leaders. Italian waterfront merchants and workers, who had been making remarkable economic progress up to then, were thus eliminated as competitors. The 1999 HBO movie Vendetta, starring Christopher Walken and directed by Nicholas Meyer, is based on Gambino's book. It portrays Macheca and several of the other lynched men as innocent victims. It is narrated by the character of Gaspare Marchesi, the boy who escaped being lynched by hiding in the prison. Reviewers have criticized Gambino's language as sensational and partisan while acknowledging the book's merits. Writing in the Journal of American History in 1977, Raymond Nussbaum (an alumnus of Tulane University) suggested that historians looking for a balanced account of the lynching look elsewhere. In a film review that appeared in the same journal in 2000, Clive Webb calls the movie a \\"compelling portrait of prejudice\\" and recommends that historians consult the book for more information. The lynching is discussed in the 2004 documentary, Linciati: Lynchings of Italians in America, directed by M. Heather Hartley. Lynchings of Italians are also mentioned in various documentaries on the Italian-American experience.

The character was introduced in April 2014 by executive producer, Frank Valentini under head writer, Ron Carlivati as a quirky environmentalist from Australia going by the name Levi Dunkleman. \\"Levi\\" comes to town as the new boyfriend of the recently returned Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) and he develops a rivalry with her roommate and potential love interest, Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). Levi has heavy influence in Maxie's life which doesn't sit well with Nathan or Maxie's stepfather, Mac Scorpio (John J. York). Levi proceeds to isolate Maxie from her friends and family by sabotaging her chances of regaining custody of her daughter and getting Nathan kicked out of their apartment. To keep Levi from being deported, Maxie agrees to marry him. On their wedding day, Nathan exposes that Levi has been after her mother, Felicia (Kristina Wagner)'s Aztec jewelry and Levi takes Maxie hostage. On August 26, 2014, it is revealed onscreen that Levi is the son of Felicia's late fianc√©, Peter Harrell played by Judson Scott from 1984 to 1985. Development =Casting and creation= In early February 2014, the series put out a casting call for the role of Levi. In early March 2014, General Hospital Happenings reported that Kirsten Storms's return as Maxie Jones would help introduce the new character. News of Garred's casting was discussed on message boards for several weeks prior to the announcement. On March 18, 2014, it was announced that Zachary Garred had been cast in the recurring role of Levi and would share his first scenes with the recently returned Storms. Garred announced that he would debut April 3, 2014. However, the former Home and Away alum, instead appeared on April 9, 2014. Soaps In Depth described Levi as a \\"spiritual counselor of sorts\\" for Maxie. Of the casting, the actor said \\"Being able to be a part of such an auspicious show with such a huge lineage is very rare, [so] I feel lucky.\\" The actor revealed on Twitter that he was only scheduled to appear for two months. In late July 2014, ABC Soaps In Depth confirmed that the actor would be sticking around after the end of his initial 12 week arc. =Characterization and portrayal= The initial casting call was said to be between the ages of 27 and 35, \\"cute\\" and \\"appealing.\\" Levi has a \\"new age vibe.\\" He is \\"soulful, zen\\" and \\"chill.\\" Levi is more worried about \\"saving the planet\\" than his appearance. Levi has \\"long hair\\" and a \\"shaggy presence.\\" Initial rumors described the character as \\"comical.\\" The character was described as a \\"guru\\" who could potentially have familial ties to an already established character. Other sources described Garred's Levi as a \\"free spirit.\\" Jamey Giddens described Levi as a \\"new age chap.\\" Soap Opera Network said Levi is \\"as groovy as the turquoise waters\\" of Garred's home country of Australia. Levi was described as a \\"peace and love hippie.\\" In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps Garred said of his portrayal ‚Äì‚Äì \\"you play him with conceited conviction, because he believes everything he is saying.\\" Executive producer Frank Valentini instructed the actor to avoid playing up typical hipster angle because it was already organically present in the character. Garred instead played the role \\"with that sort of duplicitous angle underneath\\" which he described as being quite \\"infuriating.\\" Garred commented that Levi who is \\"underhanded and duplicitous\\" catches so many people off guard because it's so unexpected. Garred praised head writer, Ron Carlivati and his team for giving him the material and said pitting his character up against the attractive \\"all American hero\\" in Ryan Paevey's Nathan helped. Garred gave credit to Valentini for his advice early on about portraying the character. Garred quoted his boss in saying, \\"You just have to play it really honest. He believes what he does and he wants Maxie to believe with him.\\" =Causing angst= During an interview with Soap Opera Digest discussing May Sweeps, Ron Carlivai explained that Levi would take every opportunity to exploit Maxie and Nathan's \\"dislike\\" for each other. Throughout the summer, Maxie faces another hurdle in trying to regain custody of her daughter. Nathan and Levi's difference in opinion over how to handle the situation causes more tension. Ron Carlivati described Maxie's unhealthy relationship with Levi as a \\"stumbling block\\" for a potential romance between Maxie and Nathan. As Garred's initial 12 week arc comes to a close, in story, Levi faces possible deportation when it is discovered that his visa has expired. Garred commented to Soap Opera Digest that it is a question of \\"How desperate is [Levi] to stay and what are the lengths he'll go to to maintain his residency ‚Äì‚Äì and his relationship with Maxie?\\" When an immigration agent shows up to confront Levi, Zachary Garred explained that Levi is grateful that Maxie stands by him because \\"Her support is the only support he has!\\" In addition to Nathan hating him, Levi has ostracized himself from Mac because he has \\"basically kidnapped [Maxie's] personality.\\" According to Garred, Levi depends on Maxie specifically. While the audience is aware of Levi's \\"duplicitous\\" ways, and Mac and Nathan constantly suspect that he is up to no good, Maxie is completely in the dark about Levi. Having Maxie as his only support \\"plays into his plan of having her exclusively to himself.\\" As more evidence points to Nathan, Garred confirms that getting Nathan away from Maxie is his \\"ultimate goal.\\" Levi can see the chemistry between them and the immigration thing allows Levi to use his own misfortune to his advantage. Even if he were to get deported, Levi would have succeeded in driving a permanent wedge between Maxie and Nathan. =Levi's identity= Ron Carlivati revealed that Garred's portrayal inspired the writers to expand his role beyond the \\"hippie vegan who seemed very sincere in his beliefs.\\" During the week of August 11, 2014, the character's true purpose slowly starts to unravel as Levi and Maxie's wedding draws near. When Nathan confronts Levi about his plans to steal the Aztec jewelry from Maxie' mother, Felicia (Kristina Wagner), things spiral out of control as Levi is willing to take extreme measures to see his plan through. Carlivati was very aware that fans were very against Maxie becoming Levi's wife because Levi had been doing \\"evil things behind her back.\\" It is Levi's evil agenda that moves the story forward during the wedding. Levi has manipulated Maxie into the marriage and she is so worried about proving everyone wrong that she digs in her heels. In addition to revealing Levi's true agenda, the wedding also launches another story. The jewels are not \\"endgame.\\" While Levi's vendetta against the Jones family is made evident, it is clear that Maxie's best friend, Lulu Spencer-Falconeri (Emme Rylan) also factors into the mystery. The next twist in the story raises the stakes. Carlivati revealed in an interview that another villain would factor into the story and said \\"I think this is going to be a classic, old-school General Hospital action/adventure story\\" similar to the iconic 1980s Ice Princess storyline. Zachary Garred as Peter Harrell (Jr.) with his shorter haircut after the character's true identity is exposed. During an interview with Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps during General Hospital Fan Club Weekend (GHFCW), Garred revealed that his character was the son of an already established character. At the fan event, Garred also debuted a shorter hair cut which he said would factor into his character's story. On August 26, 2014, Levi was revealed to the son and namesake of Peter Harrell (Judson Scott), Felicia's ex-lover. On August 28, 2014, the character appeared with his new look. Garred explained that with the revelation about Levi's identity, he thought it was \\"appropriate\\" to get rid of the disguise altogether. In an interview published on the ABC website, Garred stated that \\"Frank [Valentini] suggested some ideas to me and I jumped at the chance to cut my hair.\\" The actor described the new haircut as the revealing of the \\"real Levi. The bloke under the hair and hippy guise who has been so manipulative. But given how underhanded he has been maybe this isn't the last incarnation Levi takes‚Ä¶\\" Garred revealed that he always hoped to do something for charity with his hair and he donated it to Locks of Love non-profit organization. \\"Fans often asked if my hair was a wig, so it was only fitting that it went on to help in some way.\\" Storyline Levi accompanies his girlfriend Maxie (Kirsten Storms) back to her hometown of Port Charles in April 2014 and immediately clashes with her roommate, Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). While Levi is able to charm Maxie's mother, Felicia (Kristina Wagner), he rubs her adoptive father Mac Scorpio (John J. York) the wrong way. Levi also convinces Maxie not to seek custody of her infant daughter Georgie and use the experience as a lesson. Levi disapproves when he learns Maxie is trying to regain custody of her baby, at Nathan's encouragement. Levi supports Maxie when she loses custody of her daughter again after someone tips off the judge about Nathan covering for Maxie because she misses her original courtdate. It turns out Levi did sabotage Maxie's custody hearing though he denies any involvement when Nathan accuses him of tipping off the judge. Levi ropes Maxie into a protest to stop the ELQ waterfront renovation project claiming it will hurt the people who already live on the waterfront. ELQ's CEO Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) calls the police to have them arrested for trespassing on private property, and Levi spends the night in jail. After he is released, Levi discovers his visa has expired and he may soon be deported. In order to drive a wedge between Maxie and Nathan, Levi frames Nathan by calling immigration on himself from Nathan's phone. Though Nathan claims innocence, a furious Maxie kicks him out of their apartment. Maxie and Levi then brainstorm on how to keep him from being deported and she proposes marriage. As they prepare for the wedding, Mac and Nathan are still suspicious of Levi, specifically because of his interest in Felicia's Aztec jewelry. Just before the wedding, Felicia confides in Maxie and Levi she traded a piece of the jewelry collection to help a friend. When the necklace is stolen, Nathan becomes suspicious of Levi and confronts him moments before the wedding and finds the necklace. A struggle ensues. Levi knocks Nathan out and ties him up as he prepares for the wedding. Nathan's partner, Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) finds Nathan and frees him. Nathan tries to arrest Levi until his accomplice, the supposed \\"immigration\\" agent, Jeffrey Scribner (Jamil Walker Smith) takes Dante's wife and Maxie's matron of honor, Lulu (Emme Rylan) hostage. Levi and Scribner escape with Maxie and Lulu at gunpoint and they hide out in cabin in the woods. Scribner assumes the girls will be released after they fence the stolen jewelry for cash, but Levi has other plans. Levi shoots Scribner and escapes with the girls. While in the hospital, Scribner reveals that Levi is actually Peter Harrell, Jr., the son of Felicia's ex fianc√© (Judson Scott). Levi takes Maxie and Lulu to a secluded cabin where he plans on meeting boss (later revealed to be Victor Cassadine (Thaao Penghlis) who was helping him hold Robin Scorpio-Drake (Kimberly McCullough) hostage. Dante and Nathan corner Levi, and he is shot in the shoulder. At that moment, Victor and his men abduct the entire group. Levi recovers and finds Maxie at the bedside of his very much alive father, Peter Harrell (David Gautreaux). As father and son plan to kill Maxie, Nathan rushes in and kills Peter with a single shot to the back. Nathan and Levi fight with Levi gaining the upper hand, until Maxie kills Levi by stabbing him in the back. Levi's remains appear to have been destroyed when the clinic exploded. Reception Majority of viewers immediately hated the character and Michael Fairman credited the actor with \\"Playing The Most Despised Man on General Hospital.\\" ABC Soaps In Depth compared the character to several others that had been recently introduced and described Levi as a \\"caricature masquerading as a character.\\" The magazine said the writers made Garred's job of making the character \\"likeable\\" an \\"impossible task.\\" According to the magazine, Garred's job was made more difficult due to the \\"instant chemistry\\" between Ryan Paevey and Kirsten Storms. Soap columnist Carolyn Hinsey also criticized the story, \\"Soaps are doing that thing again where they write big stories for new characters we don't care about ‚Ä¶ which never works,\\" and continued by saying, \\"But nothing is worse than Levi, the blunder from Down Under.\\" Hinsey said the \\"green-card\\" marriage was too predictable and thought the writers could have come with a much better obstacle for Nathan and Maxie. Soaps In Depth praised Zachary Garred for being a \\"good sport\\" about the backlash from fans. On the feud between on the feud between Levi and Nathan, Soaps In Depth said that while most viewers understandably wanted Levi gone, \\"we kinda love scenes where his portrayer, Zachary Garred, matches wits with Ryan Paevey's Nathan.\\" Though both characters are almost \\"cartoonishly stuck in their respective good guy/bad guy roles,\\" the magazine pointed out that it had work for the show a lot in recent years. SID continued by saying that while the actors appeared to be enjoying themselves, \\"so are we!\\" Carlivati was happy about the audience's absolute hatred of the Levi character and praised Zachary Garred's portrayal. The actor was receptive to the hatred from fans thought, \\"Wow! This is cool!\\" Garred joked that, \\"Even my own dad said he wanted to smack me in the face when he was watching Levi.\\" Carolyn Hinsey said the writers took too long to reveal Levi's true identity, \\"but once they did, the denouement was a gem.\\" References Category:General Hospital characters Category:Fictional con artists Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Levi Dunkleman"},{"id":"43678950","text":"Zee Lamhe was a TV channel that operated in USA.

He is best known for extending CBT to include principles of evolutionary psychology and collaborating with the founder of CBT Albert Ellis to develop many new applications to for these clinical modalities. His new clinical method which applies evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics to CBT is called Informed Cognitive Therapy (ICT). Dr. Abrams is an Adjunct Full Professor in the M.A. Program in Psychology at New York University where he teaches graduate level courses in modern psychotherapeutic technique, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and the Psychology of Sexuality. Abrams is also the managing partner of psychology for NJ, LLC a private self-funded clinical research organization. He is a contributor to About.com and is on the editorial board of Counseling and Psychotherapy Transcripts and several other journals. He actively researches the changing views and expectations of psychotherapy. Prior to his work with Ellis and his more recent contributions to psychotherapy research, Abrams worked with people suffering from life- threatening illnesses and was the first non-gay psychologist to volunteer to counsel people with AIDS at the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York. This work led to a book co-authored with Ellis on Death and Dying. In it, he and Ellis rejected the stage theory of Kubler-Ross and replaced it with a constructivist model of the psychology of confronting mortality. Work With Albert Ellis Dr. Abrams was instrumental in the formalization of Albert Ellis' model of personality. Prior to the collaboration of Albert Ellis with Mike Abrams the REBT model of personality was limited to the ABCDE model of disturbed thinking and emotions. Their collaboration led to a more comprehensive explanation of normative and pathological personality by setting forth an iterative model of personality development. This more detailed explanation argued that the universal tendency towards irrational thinking that Ellis stated was universal. The Ellis - Abrams model proposed that people are innately and evolutionarily inclined towards rigid cognitive styles that included demandingness, absolutism, or dichotomous thinking. These irrational thinking styles were said to be exacerbated or attenuated during development by both life adversities and innate temperaments. This and related REBT personality theories were presented in the text Abrams coauthored with Ellis which was Ellis‚Äôs only college textbook Personality Theories: Critical Perspectives. In addition, to his personality studies with Ellis, Abrams' research with Ellis into REBT and CBT led him to propose that all successful psychotherapies were actually performing CBT - irrespective of their stated theoretical orientation. Abrams argued that the equivalence of most psychotherapies found in outcome studies was a result the tendency of competent therapists to gradually progress to REBT/CBT techniques - irrespective of their claimed orientation or approach. Work on Evolutionary Psychology After Ellis' death, Abrams continued Ellis's work on sexuality by taking an evolutionary psychology perspective to love and intimacy. This work reached fruition in his book on sexuality titled Sexuality: Development, Differences, and Disorders. The book is only textbook on human sexuality that takes an exclusively evolutionary perspective. Abrams wrote the book utilizing a journalistic approach interviewing many of the best known evolutionary psychologists such as David Buss, Doug Kenrick, Helen Fisher, and J. Philipe Rushton to provide multiple and often conflicting perspectives. He further extended the work of Ellis by publishing the first article, along with David Buss, to apply evolutionary psychology to CBT. Informed Cognitive Therapy Recently, Abrams expanded upon the synthesis of CBT and evolutionary psychology with the book The New CBT: Clinical Evolutionary Psychology. This book which set forth a new variation of CBT called informed cognitive therapy (ICT) took what was implied in much of Ellis' work and made it explicit. Abrams combined evidence from behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology to add to the effectiveness of CBT in a clinical text proposing a new variant of CBT. Abrams argues that most psychological disorders overlie a latent factor common to virtually all pathologies. According to his model this latent factor is heritable and is supported by genome-wide studies of mental pathologies. In addition, he proposed that all psychopathologies have a heritable component that is often associated with mismatched evolutionary adaptations. Consequently, his ICT therapy requires that clinicians become familiar with behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology, and the relationship that these sciences have with psychological problems. Abrams' premise has been supported by evolutionary psychologists like Todd Shackelford, behavioral geneticists like Robert Plomin and cognitive/memory psychologists like Elizabeth Loftus.

It has been recognized by cardiologists as a monumental discovery, and a milestone in cardiac electrophysiology\\". The monograph revealed the existence of the atrioventricular node and the function of Purkinje cells. It was used by Arthur Keith and Martin Flack as a detailed guide in their attempts to verify the existence of the Bundle of His, which subsequently led to their discovery of the sinoatrial node. Throughout the beginning of the 20th century, Tawara's monograph influenced the work of many cardiologists and it was later cited by Willem Einthoven in his anatomical interpretation of the electrocardiogram.  Background  Prior to Tawara's discoveries, it was assumed that electrical conduction through the Bundle of His was slow, because of the long interval between atrial and ventricular contractions. The Swiss cardiologist Wilhelm His, Jr. assumed that the heart bundle was connected directly to the base of the ventricle, and physiologists incorrectly taught that the base of the ventricle contracted first, followed by the apex. However, Tawara postulated that ventricular contraction occurs in the opposite manner, with the apex contracting earlier than the base. He also believed that the heart's electrical conduction was not slow but rapid. Working under the guidance of his mentor, Ludwig Aschoff, Tawara performed a histological examination of 150 hearts with myocarditis (which led to the discovery of Aschoff bodies), and he began examining the atrioventricular bundle before embarking on a comprehensive study of the anatomy and histology of the heart's conduction system. The implications of his work were immediately recognized by Aschoff, who arranged for it to be published in the form of a monograph.  Discoveries  Tawara's monograph, titled \\"Das Reizleitungssystem des S√§ugetierherzens\\" (English: \\"The Conduction System of the Mammalian Heart\\") was published in 1906. The most important discoveries are listed below: #The Bundle of His is divided into 2 bundle branches that are connected with a fanlike group of ‚Äúsubendocardially scattered characteristic muscular bundles‚Äù. #Purkinje cells act as a pathway for the \\"atrioventricular connecting system\\". #The atrioventricular connecting system starts in the atrioventricular node, moves into the fibrocartilaginous portion of the septum (Bundle of His), divides into defined left and right bundle branches, and descends into the terminal ends of the Purkinje fibers. Tawara commented that the system represents a transporting or conducting pathway, and \\"because the pathway is not a ductal, but a continuously related protoplasmic cord, conduction of excitation impulses surely must take place there.\\"  Influences  On 26 September 1905, shortly before the monograph was due to be published, Ludwig Aschoff wrote an article about Tawara's work. It was subsequently read by the Scottish cardiologist James Mackenzie and forwarded to anatomist Arthur Keith, who was attempting to confirm the existence of the Bundle of His. Despite putting in his best efforts, he failed to locate the structure. On 15 January 1906, Keith wrote a letter to Mackenzie and acknowledged his skepticism about its existence: \\"I have given up the search for His' bundle‚Äîhaving come to the conclusion that there is not and never was any such thing.‚Äù ; Verification of the Bundle of His (1906) In response to Arthur Keith's skepticism, Mackenzie forwarded Aschoff's article about Tawara's findings, which stimulated Keith's renewal of his studies on the cardiac conduction system. Despite having written a letter to The Lancet about his failure to locate the Bundle of His and his increasing doubts about its existence, Keith (with his student Martin Flack) later reported that they had succeeded in locating the structure by following the detailed descriptions and figures in Tawara's monograph. In a paper published in The Lancet on 11 August 1906, they acknowledged the monograph's high degree of accuracy: :\\"We take this opportunity of clearly stating that although some of our observations are new our work is in the main but a verification of the accurate and complete monograph published recently by Tawara, a Japanese working in the laboratory of Professor Aschoff of Marburg.\\" ; Discovery of the sinoatrial node (1907) Encouraged by their initial success and inspired by Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node, Keith and Flack extended their studies and eventually discovered the sinoatrial node in 1907. They wrote that they were examining other regions of the heart for \\"peculiar musculature\\" similar to the one discovered by Tawara. ; Theoretical basis for the electrocardiogram (1908) In 1908, the Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven referred to Tawara‚Äôs monograph as the anatomical basis for interpreting the electrocardiogram. In his monograph, Tawara theorized about the velocity of the excitatory process in the conduction system and the mode of ventricular contraction. Together with his anatomic findings and physiological assumptions, it contributed to the rapid popularization of electrocardiography. ; Other influences and reviews In 1909, the American pathologist Lydia DeWitt created the first 3D wax model of the conduction system, using Tawara‚Äôs description as a guide. In 1911, the British cardiologist Thomas Lewis reviewed the auriculo-ventricular connection system and described Tawara's discoveries in Das Reizleitungssystem des Saugetierherzens as the \\"main advance\\" in knowledge about the system: :\\"The main advance was made by Tawara, working under the direction of Aschoff. In his book, Das Reizleitungssystem des Saugetierherzens, a complete account of the junctional tissues was given, and the anatomy of the whole system and the connections with the network of Purkinje were described in great detail and in many species of animals. These observations upon the anatomy have received complete confirmation by the more recent writings.\\" In his autobiography published in 1950, Arthur Keith explained how he had systematically searched for Tawara's system to verify its components: :\\"I was able in heart after heart to verify the existence of Tawara‚Äôs system. The auricles, I found, were joined to the ventricles by an elaborate system which, beginning in a root like structure in the auricular septum, ended as an arborescence in the ventricles. The ‚Äòbundle of His‚Äô was but a small segment of the Tawara system.\\" Acknowledging the significance and implications of these discoveries, Keith commented: \\"With the discovery of the conducting system of Tawara, heart research entered a new epoch.\\" Shortly before his death, Wilhelm His, Jr. published a personal account about the discovery of the Bundle of His. He noted that it took ten years before anatomists began to pay attention to the bundle, starting with the studies of Retzer and Brauning in 1903, followed by the \\"important work of Tawara\\" in 1906, and the subsequent discovery of the sinus node which completed the system. He credited Tawara for connecting the bundle with the Purkinje fibers and for declaring it the heart's conduction system.

Jaakkola is known as a historian who primarily researched medieval history and sought to put forth that Finland existed as an entity already during that period. Some of Jaakkola's hypotheses are today considered to be overtly nationalist and outdated, but his influence during his lifetime remains undisputed. His other research interests included the historical origins of the Birkarls and Kvens, and the historical background of Kalevala epic poetry.  Early life and education  Jaakkola was born in Eurajoki to a peasant family of Markus Jaakkola and Johanna Fredrika Nuorante. He completed student matriculation in 1905 and studied history and Finnish language at the University of Helsinki. He made studying journeys to Germany and Sweden, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1909, a licentiate in 1921, and a PhD in 1923. The subject of his doctoral thesis was the legend of Eric IX of Sweden and its authenticity. He worked as a teacher and a headmaster until he was appointed a docent of Nordic history in 1923, and later a professor of Finnish history in 1932.  Work  The focus of his research was the medieval period of Finnish history, as he endeavoured to write a history extending from the ancient times for the newly independent country. He emphasized Finnish position in the Western sphere of influence and concentrated on the history of his home region, Satakunta. Jaakkola supported his historical research with toponymy, ethnopoetics, epic poetry, and sometimes extensive speculation. Many of Jaakkola's assertions have been refuted by later research. Between 1935 and 1959, Jaakkola published an extensive five-volume synthesis on Finnish history from the Viking Age to the sixteenth century. The series is especially speculative in regard to the sections on history prior to the fourteenth century, although the books included almost all sources available in the Finnish history. The works were criticized by archaeologists at the time of their release. Despite this criticism, Jaakkola decided not to do any major changes for the reprints. The central theme of the series was the medieval political history of Finland, during which, as Jaakkola argued, there was a period of ancient independence during which the country guarded its own interests. He envisioned Finland almost as a fourth member of the Kalmar Union, instead of an insignificant part of Sweden. The most theoretically sustainable conclusions of Jaakkola include viewing the Swedish crusades to Finland as more of a peaceful transition to Swedish rule and Catholicism rather than as a period of conflict. Jaakkola wanted to continue his series to cover the twentieth century, and the work was carried on by his students who wrote two works on the period of the Swedish rule, but after Jaakkola died in 1964, the series was discontinued. After the Winter War, Jaakkola wrote the concise presentation of Finnish history, Suomen historian √§√§riviivat, which was meant for readers abroad. It was translated into several languages. During the Continuation War, President Risto Ryti commissioned Jaakkola to write Die Ostfrage Finnlands (1941), to argue for Finnish territorial expansion eastwards to the Kola Peninsula and East Karelia. Jaakkola's writing took on a nationalist and irredentist tone as he attempted to justify the Finnish expansion. Despite the difficult style and academic nature of Jalmari Jaakkola's works, his influence on contemporary beliefs is considered to have been extensive. He chose the text, \\"The seer of early Finnish history\\", for his 75th anniversary memorial medal. He was the editor of the scientific journal Historiallinen aikakauskirja between 1935 and 1959. Jaakkola was awarded an honorary degree from the faculty of theology at the University of Helsinki and the faculty of philosophy at the University of Turku.  Personal  Jaakkola married Katie Jansson in 1915, with whom he had one child.
