He resided in Tehran city for practically his whole life, and was born and died there. His birth name was Parviz Sedighi Parsi. He was musically educated primarily by his uncle Hossein Yahaghi, a violinist and violin teacher, from whom Parviz adopted the Yahaghi name. During his youth Parviz was exposed to many highly professional musicians in Tehran who were friends of his uncle. A notable visitor at his uncle's house was the violin teacher, composer, and musicologist Abolhasan Saba, who is credited with making improvements in violin playing technique in the Persian tradition. Saba published a two-volume training manual for the violin in 1944-45. Starting from about 20 years of age Parviz Yahaghi was employed for a little over two decades as a musician with the Iranian government-financed radio station. In the 1960s and 1970s at the radio station he composed hundreds of pieces both for violin and for celebrated singers in Iran such as Banan, Marzieh, Delkash, Pouran, Elahe, Homeyra, Mahasti, Dariush Rafei, Homayoonpour, and Iraj (Hossein Khajeh Amiri). These compositions were often produced in connection with the long- running radio program Golha. Yahaghi's ability in playing violin, his compositions, and his musical director's role made him a central figure in Persian music during the 1970s. Yahaghi's violin is tuned in a way that gives different resonances and drones to the sound, compared to standard European tuning, and he uses a number of different tuning schemes. Before the arrival of the 1979 political revolution in Iran, Yahaghi had already resigned from the government radio station and set up a recording studio of his own in Tehran. In the wake of the revolution, many of Yahaghi's friends and associates departed from Iran and did not return. But Yahaghi stayed. His wife, Homeyra, one of Iran's most famous singers, moved permanently to the USA without him. (The revolutionaries outlawed female solo singing, though women were free to continue to play musical instruments and to sing in choruses.) Yahaghi was arrested, interrogated, and released by the new regime. During the 1980s with the war between Iran and Iraq going on, he was invited by the regime to compose music, particularly patriotic music. He declined. But the official authorities came around to viewing him with such esteem that after his death some of his musical instruments, recording equipment and other items were appropriated as national and historic property. Parviz Yahaghi's most widely distributed recordings outside Iran is probably the five-volume \\"Persian Melodies\\" collection (five compact discs); the four-volume \\"Violin Melodies\\" collection is the same thing as the first four volumes of \\"Persian Melodies\\". Other albums by Yahaghi currently in print include \\"Toreh\\" in two volumes (i.e. two compact discs); \\"Tooba\\" (a.k.a. Tobi) in two volumes; \\"Taravat\\" in two volumes; the three-volume set headlined \\"Iranian Classical Music\\" whose three volumes are called Ashk & Tulu, Yad, and Faryad; and other albums by Yahaghi in print include \\"Kimia\\", \\"Saz-e Del\\", \\"Mehr\\", \\"Mahtab\\", and \\"Raaz & Niyaz\\".See: Music Box catalog. These albums don't contain any overlap in recorded material with themselves or with the Violin Melodies collection, although at times one hears some recurring themes being reworked and replayed. All these albums are instrumental only (no singing) and monophonic only. (The many early recordings of Yahaghi playing with a singer are published under the singer's name). Additional instrumental music featuring Yahaghi is available from the Taknavazan Collection. This collection consists of forty compact discs of Persian traditional instrumental music, featuring the violin on the majority of the tracks. Yahaghi plays violin on at least one track on at least 25 of the 40 compact discs (and the discs have four tracks each, typically). The other violinists in the Persian tradition who are present in this Taknavazan Collection are Ali Tajvidi (ÿπŸÑ€å ÿ™ÿ¨Ÿà€åÿØ€å), Habibollah Badiei (ÿ≠ÿ®€åÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ®ÿØ€åÿπ€å), Homayoun Khorram (ŸáŸÖÿßŸäŸàŸÜ ÿÆÿ±ŸÖ), and Asadollah Malek (ÿßÿ≥ÿØÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÖŸÑ⁄©), all of whom were students of Abolhasan Saba in Tehran, and are similar to Yahaghi in aesthetics and technique.

This piece was recorded by and for the government-owned radio station in Iran in the early 1970s when Yahaghi was an employee at the station. Apparently, the ultimate copyright holder is the government of Iran, which today does not seek to restrict the free distribution of it.

From Marsing it travels east to Nampa, Meridian, and Eagle, then north to Horseshoe Bend. SH-55 then climbs the Payette River to Banks, then its north fork to the Long Valley, through the towns of Cascade and McCall. After descending a narrow canyon to Meadows, SH-55 terminates in New Meadows at the junction with US-95. Route description In the southwest corner of Idaho, State Highway 55 starts at the junction with US-95, approximately west of Marsing. The highway heads eastward as it travels through Marsing, crosses the Snake River and the Snake River Valley AVA. The highway continues east to Nampa(mostly as Karcher Road), where it meets Interstate 84 and US-30. The highway is cosigned with those routes as it heads eastward to Meridian. Highway 55 turns northward at Eagle Road and crosses the Boise River near Eagle. The junction with SH-44 is in Eagle, where the routes are briefly cosigned. East of Eagle, Highway 55 turns northward and climbs to the Spring Valley and over the Spring Valley Summit, at , then descends vertically on Horseshoe Bend Hill into Horseshoe Bend. The new multi-lane grade was completed in fall 1991; the old curvier road is to the west, long plagued by landslides and closures. North of Horseshoe Bend, the highway ascends the Payette River and passes through several recreational areas, which offer rafting, fishing, and camping activities. Highway 55 continues north, through the small communities of Banks and Smiths Ferry, then crosses the river via the Rainbow Bridge (built in 1933), originally known as the North Fork Bridge. SH-55 then climbs Round Valley Creek to Round Valley, and continues northward through the extended Long Valley of Valley County to the county seat of Cascade. It ascends a brief summit at at Little Donner (web-cam), then descends to follow the east shore of Cascade Reservoir. The route continues northward to Donnelly, the turnoff for Tamarack Resort, located to the southwest, on the western shore of the reservoir. SH-55 continues north through the valley to McCall, at the south shore of Payette Lake, the host of many scenic, recreational, and winter activities. Meeting the south shore of Payette Lake, Highway 55 turns westward as Lake Street through McCall and its west \\"Lardo\\" area. West of town, the road climbs to the Red Ridge, where it reaches its maximum elevation of above sea level, immediately northeast of the Little Ski Hill, also known as Goose Creek Summit (web-cam). further is the turnoff for the Brundage Mountain ski area, four miles (6 km) north on Goose Lake Road. Highway 55 then enters a narrow and twisty canyon, rapidly descending with Little Goose Creek to Meadows, then to its northern terminus, the junction with US-95 in New Meadows at in Meadows Valley. Highway 55, from Eagle north to US-95 in New Meadows, is the Payette River Scenic Byway,Idaho Byways - Payette River Scenic Byway part of the National Scenic Byways Program. History The original State Highway 55 ran from US-2 in Colburn to what is now State Highway 200. This highway was decommissioned in October 1955, and is now Colburn-Culver Road. The current route was designated as State Highway 55 in September 1967, replacing former State Highway 72 and former State Highway 15. Idaho State Highway 72 has since been reassigned to another road. State Highway 55 was originally routed through downtown Boise, and followed the old alignment of State Highway 44 down State Street and 23rd Street to Fairview Avenue. From there it turned westward with US-20, US-26 and US-30. The highway continued westward on the Boise Connector then Interstate 180N (now Interstate 184), and continued west along Interstate 80N (now Interstate 84), where it followed its present alignment toward Nampa. Recently in late 2006, the route was realigned away from downtown Nampa when a new interchange, Interchange #33 along Interstate 84 was opened and provided a more direct connection to State Highway 55 from the Interstate. The segments of SH-55 following the former Nampa Boulevard (now Northside Boulevard) and Caldwell Boulevard (now Business Route 84) through Nampa have been decommissioned favoring the more direct routing. From there the highway followed its current alignment from that point to Marsing and its southern terminus at US-95.

Brandeis, are a set of principles used by the United States Supreme Court for avoiding constitutional rulings.  Rules for Judicial Self-Restraint and Avoiding Constitutional Questions  Justice Louis D. Brandeis, concurring in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288 (1936), summarized some prudential rules for exercising judicial self-restraint and avoiding ruling on the constitutionality of congressional legislation: The Court developed, for its own governance in the cases confessedly within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision. They are: # The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non- adversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions \\"is legitimate only in the last resort, earnest and vital controversy between individuals. It never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.\\"Chicago & Grand Trunk Ry. v. Wellman, 143 U.S. 339 (1892) # The Court will not \\"anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.\\" Liverpool, N.Y. & P.S.S. Co. v. Emigration Commissioners, 113 U.S. 33 (1885) \\"It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.\\" Burton v. United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905) # The Court will not \\"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the Precise facts to which it is to be applied.\\" # The Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of. This rule has found most varied application. Thus, if a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter. Appeals from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground. # The Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation. Among the many applications of this rule, none is more striking than the denial of the right to challenge to one who lacks a personal or property right. (While not mentioned in Ashwander, there are exceptions in the case of a First Amendment challenge where the party may raise the effect of a law on other person's First Amendment rights, the so-called \\"chilling effect\\" doctrine.) # The Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits. # \\"When the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\" Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22 (1932)  See also  *Judicial Review *Judiciary Act of 1789 *Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States *U.S. Constitution, Article III *U.S. Constitution, Eleventh Amendment  References  Category:Supreme Court of the United States Category:Constitutional law ","title":"Ashwander rules"},{"id":"14010653","text":"was a Japanese philosopher who studied Chinese philosophy. Life Imamichi taught in Europe (Paris and Germany) as well as in Japan (he was also emeritus professor of the University of Palermo). Beginning in 1979 he was the president of the Centre International pour l'√âtude Compar√©e de Philosophie et d'Esth√©tique and after 1997 of the International Institute of Philosophy. In 1976 he founded the journal Aesthetics. He translated Aristotle's Poetics into Japanese (in 1972) and has written numerous books in Japanese. Imamichi was a supporter of communication between cultures. He characterizes Western philosophy as an attempt to achieve a God's eye view (das in-dem-Gott-sein; to be in the being of God) and Eastern philosophy as an attempt to be in the world (das in-der-Welt-sein). Imamichi sees in both stances two incomplete and complementary humanisms, and observes that since the publication of The Book of Tea, some Western philosophers have adopted a more Eastern stance while other Eastern philosophers have attempted to reach the Absolute or the Eternal. Tomonobu Imamichi was the father of guitarist and songwriter Tomotaka Imamichi, pianist Nobuko Kawaguchi, biologist Yukiko Imamichi and psychologist Tomoaki Imamichi.

Almost all of the Apogee titles were packaged with CDROMs or DVDs which included what was, at the time, the first digital release of seminal NASA footage, including the first commercial release of the uncut television broadcast of the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Notable contributors to the Apogee series include Sir Arthur C. Clarke, Tom Hanks, Ron Howard, Buzz Aldrin, Harrison Schmitt, William Pogue, Wernher von Braun, David Lasser, Sy Liebergot, Guenter Wendt, Robert Zubrin, Wally Schirra, David R. Scott, Rick Tumlinson and Winston Scott. Apogee Books has performed contracted work with or for, Lockheed, Boeing, Energia, NASA, Imax, Space Frontier Foundation, The Mars Society and The National Space Society. An offshoot of Apogee Books, publishing science fiction, began in 2005. Apogee Science Fiction specializes in space-related historical science fiction. By 2007 titles had been published by Hugo Gernsback, Garrett P. Serviss, Wernher von Braun, and George Griffith.

(1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Flora of China: Erysimum cheiranthoides Like other Erysimum species, E. cheiranthoides accumulates two major classes of defensive chemicals, glucosinolates and cardiac glycosides. Description It is a herbaceous, annual plant similar in appearance to many other mustards, growing an erect stem , (rarely 150 cm) tall. The leaves are lanceolate to elliptic, 2‚Äì11 cm long and 0.5‚Äì1 cm broad, with an entire to coarsely toothed margin. It blooms in summer, between June and August. The flowers are bright yellow, 5‚Äì12 mm diameter, produced in an erect inflorescence. Later, it produces a slender cylindrical capsule, 1‚Äì3 cm (rarely 5 cm) long, containing several small, pale brown, or dark brown seeds.Flora of NW Europe: Erysimum cheiranthoides Taxonomy It was formerly described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus in his seminal publication 'Species Plantarum' in 1753, on page 661. It is commonly known as treacle- mustard, or wormseed wallflower. The treacle mustard name came from the Greek word 'theriaki' meaning antidote to poisonous bites as the plant was thought to have healing properties. The name 'wormseed mustard' arose from the seeds of the plant being made into treacle, to treat intestinal worms in children. Distribution Erysimum cheiranthoides Erysimum cheiranthoides is native to temperate areas of Europe and Asia. =Range= It is found in Asia within China (in the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, Nei Monggol and Xinjiang), Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Siberia. In Eastern Europe, it is found in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Ukraine. In middle Europe, it is found within Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Switzerland. In Northern Europe, in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In Southeastern Europe, within Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. It is also widely naturalised outside of its native range,Med- Checklist: Erysimum cheiranthoides from New Zealand, other parts of Europe, to North America,USDA Plants Profile: Erysimum cheiranthoides (including parts of Canada and Argentina (in Tierra del Fuego). Habitat It grows in disturbed areas, fields, and dry stream beds. It is normally found at altitudes of above sea level.  Chemical ecology  Like other members of the genus Erysimum, E. cheiranthoides produces two major classes of chemical defenses against herbivory: glucosinolates, which are characteristic of the plant family Brassicaceae, and cardiac glycosides (cardenolides), a class of chemicals produced by at least twelve different plant families. Glucosinolates found in E. cheiranthoides include glucoiberin, glucoerucin, glucocheirolin, and glucoiberverin. Cardenolides reported in E. cheiranthoides seeds include strophanthidin, digitoxigenin, cannogenol, erychroside, erysimoside, erycordin, cheiranthoside, glucoerysimoside, and glucodigifucoside. Some crucifer-specialist insect herbivores do not feed and/or oviposit readily on E. cheiranthoides. Anthocharis cardamines (orange tip butterfly), which oviposits on almost all crucifer species, avoids E. cheiranthoides. Similarly, the crucifer-feeding specialist Pieries rapae (white cabbage butterfly) is deterred from feeding and oviposition on E. cheiranthoides. However, another pierid species, Pieris napi oleracea (green veined white butterfly), not only is less sensitive to exogenously added cardenolides than P. rapae in oviposition assays, but also oviposits more readily on E. cheiranthoides leaves. In the case of P. rapae, oviposition experiments with extracts of E. cheiranthoides sprayed onto Brassica oleracea (cabbage) identified both attractants and deterrents. Whereas 3-methylsulfinylpropyl glucosinolate and 3-methylsufonylpropyl glucosinolate stimulated oviposition, erysimoside and erychroside in E. cheiranthoides extracts were deterrent. In contrast, another cardiac glycoside, erycordin, was inactive in this oviposition assay. Pieris rapae tarsal sensilla respond to both glucosinolates and cardenolides, indicating that these compounds are detected on the leaf surface prior to oviposition. Consistent with the deterrent effects on oviposition, cardenolides from E. cheiranthoides leaf extracts also served as feeding deterrents for P. rapae caterpillars. Predatory paper wasps (Polistes dominulus) required more time to consume Pieris napi (green-veined white) caterpillars that had fed on E. cheiranthoides than those that had fed on Brassica oleracea (cabbage). This was ascribed to the time that it took the wasps to selectively remove the caterpillar guts, which contained plant material. Use as a model organism Erysimum cheiranthoides variety Elbtalaue in a growth chamber Because Erysimum is in the family Brassicaceae, it has been proposed that many of the genetic resources that already exist for Arabidopsis thaliana (an extensively studied model organism) can be used with Erysimum to aide in genetic analysis, making this genus particularly attractive for studying the cardenolide biosynthetic pathway. E. cheiranthoides itself is diploid and has a relatively small genome (~200 Mbp across 8 chromosomes), can be grown from seed to seed production as fast as 10 weeks, and performs well in a laboratory setting. The genome of E. cheiranthoides variety Elbtalaue has been sequenced. As E. cheiranthoides has many genetic similarities to A. thaliana, it is likely that techniques for genetically modifying A. thaliana and related research methods will also work for E. cheiranthoides. Medicinal uses Cardiac glycosides, which are abundant in E. cheiranthoides, have been used for treating heart disease and other ailments in traditional and modern medicine. However, E. cheiranthoides is not a commonly used source of these compounds. Nevertheless, E. cheiranthoides has been used as an herbal remedy in traditional Chinese medicine. European herbalists in the 16th century, used the plant as a remedy for insect and animal bites. The common name wormseed wallflower comes from the use of E. cheiranthoides in treating intestinal worms.

Gallimard) The State of Siege () is the fourth play by Albert Camus. The play by the Maribor Slovene National Theatre in 1955 Written in 1948, The State of Siege--the original sense is closer to state of emergency--is a play in three acts presenting the arrival of plague, personified by a young opportunist, in sleepy Cadiz and the subsequent creation of a totalitarian regime through the manipulation of fear. In a piece written in 1948, in reply to criticisms from Gabriel Marcel, Camus defended his decision to set the play in Spain, and not in Eastern Europe, citing the ongoing oppression in Spain, France's collusion in it, and the Catholic Church's abandonment of Spanish Christians. \\"Why Spain\\" in Resistance, Rebellion, and Death. Trans. Justin O'Brien. New York, Vintage; 1960. The piece was first performed in October 1948, and was initially received poorly by critics and public, who had eagerly awaited the work, but expected a dramatisation of Camus's novel The Plague. While the two share a common background, the treatments are entirely different in tone. Although Camus himself was pleased with the work, critics remained unimpressed. The State of Siege has remained almost constantly in print in French, and since 1958 in an English translation by Stuart Gilbert--in Caligula and Three Other Plays--with a foreword by Camus.

He is the creator of the first consumer flight simulator software. He founded Sublogic after graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1977, and released the first version of Flight Simulator for the Apple II the following year. His original Apple II software was purchased by Microsoft in 1982 and became Microsoft Flight Simulator. After Sublogic, Bruce founded the Bruce Artwick Organization, which continued development of flight simulator products and was eventually bought out by Microsoft. Early life and education Artwick was born and raised in Norridge, Illinois, and attended Triton Junior College before transferring to University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign to study computer engineering in 1973. When he arrived, Artwick first switched his focus to electrical engineering because he believed that the degree would be more acceptable to the public eye. As a student at the University of Illinois, Artwick expressed his enthusiasm for aviation by doing research at the Aviation Research Lab. Artwick held a technician position in the DCL (Digital Computer Lab). Between 1975 and 1976, Artwick and his graphic group at the University designed graphic terminals for the DCL. During this time, Artwick found the time to become a pilot. The number of hours spent doing graphics led to a rich understanding of the topic. Artwick noted, \\"I learned more working in the basement of the DCL than in classes.\\" Artwick graduated with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1975 and obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering in the following year. Flight Simulator In his thesis of May 1976, called ‚ÄúA versatile computer generated dynamic flight display‚Äù, he displayed a model of the flight of an aircraft on a computer screen. With this, Artwick proved that it was possible to use the 6800 microprocessor, the first available microcomputer, to handle the graphics and calculations of the specifications needed to produce real-time flight simulation. After establishing Sublogic in 1977, Artwick took his thesis one step further by developing the first flight simulator program for the Apple II, which was based on the 6502 microprocessor. He followed up the simulator with a Radio Shack TRS-80 version. By the year 1981, Flight Simulator became so popular that it was reportedly the best-selling title for Apple. Shortly after, Microsoft decided to enter the fray to obtain a license for Flight Simulator. Microsoft obtained a joint license and by November 1982, Microsoft's version of Flight Simulator hit the stores as a PC entertainment program. As years passed, computer graphics continued to improve and Flight Simulator software also changed along with it. Sublogic Bruce Artwick established Sublogic in October 1977. It was incorporated in April 1978 by Bruce's partner, Stu Moment. The business strategy of Sublogic was to sell software through the mail. The company found itself growing a substantial amount in just two years‚Äô time and Artwick decided to move part of his operation back to Champaign-Urbana. Sublogic continued to grow and developed various versions of the flight simulator program as well as other entertainment programs. At the beginning of the year 1982, Flight Simulator became a top selling product for Apple who purchased the Flight Simulator product. Microsoft realized his expertise in the field of flight simulation and asked Artwick to partake in a project that would change the simulator industry. Instead of flight purposes, Microsoft wanted to showcase the machine's graphics capabilities. By the late 1980s, the Sublogic business started to decline because the 8-bit market shifted to a 16-bit market so Artwick decided to pursue other things and left Sublogic. The name Sublogic came from logic circuits Artwick built for the PDP-11 in the University of Illinois' Digital Computer Laboratory (DCL).  BAO Ltd.  In 1988, he left Sublogic and found BAO Ltd. (Bruce Artwick Organization), retaining the copyright to Flight Simulator, which he continued to develop. BAO started off with six employees and grew to over 30 by 1995. BAO continued to grow and oversaw development of many aviation products in many different versions on various systems. The market by this time expanded to include flight simulator products for the Federal Aviation Administration. It was there that BAO produced aviation-related software that would be implemented into things like tower control simulation to train air traffic controllers. In 1994, BAO released Microsoft Space Simulator. In 1995, it released Tower, an air traffic control simulator. In January 1995, BAO and the copyright to Flight Simulator were acquired by Microsoft. Artwick remained with the company as a consultant.

The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history New Glasgow transited from Esquimalt to Halifax, Nova Scotia via the Panama Canal, arriving at HMC Dockyard, Halifax on 17 February 1944 under command of Lt. Cdr. G.S. Hall, RCNR. After working up at Bermuda, New Glasgow was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-1. She was employed on trans-Atlantic convoy duty for the next five months. In September 1944 she transferred to escort group EG 26, based out of Derry in the United Kingdom. Early in 1945, she was temporarily assigned to Portsmouth and Plymouth commands. New Glasgows gunners loading a QF 4-inch Mk XIX gun off British Columbia, circa 1944 On 20 March 1945, New Glasgow was responsible for the loss of the last U-boat by an RCN warship during the Second World War. On that day she was operating off Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland when the snorkel of a U-boat was observed near the ship's bow. Before depth charges could be dropped, the vessels collided, with each side claiming to have rammed the other. Both vessels were badly damaged. The U-boat, later revealed to be quickly dived while New Glasgow limped to Londonderry Port with a broken propeller and other hull damage. Meanwhile, the Allies tasked a 14-ship naval task force comprising Escort Groups C-4, 25 and 26 to find the U-boat, without success. Two days later, on 23 March 1945, the U-boat was scuttled in the Northern Channel a few miles north of Inistrahull Beacon (Malin Head), Ireland. The commander and 16 crew members died as a result of the incident. The 31 surviving crew members were rescued by Escort Group 25. The wreck of U-1003 was discovered by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001. The attack periscope was found to have been extended, along with the schnorchel. The mast had broken off and the periscope was bent so badly that it actually pointed downwards. New Glasgow remained in port under repair until 5 June 1945. New Glasgow returned to Canada and was decommissioned by the RCN and placed in reserve at Shelburne, Nova Scotia on 4 November 1945. =Postwar service= New Glasgow underwent conversion to a in 1953‚Äì1955. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She was recommissioned with pennant FFE 315 on 30 January 1954, the first of the rebuilt frigates assigned to the West Coast. On 1 January 1955, New Glasgow was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron of Pacific Command. In November 1955, the Second Canadian Escort Squadron was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California. During service with the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron she was fitted with a midship deckhouse to provide classroom and training facilities for officer candidates. New Glasgow was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at Yokohama, Japan, Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor. They returned to Canada in August. From January to March 1961, , New Glasgow and performed a training cruise to the South Pacific, visiting Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and Samoa. She served in a training capacity until being paid off by the RCN at Esquimalt on 30 January 1967. She was sold and broken up in Japan later that year.

Early in his career he was a rock music impresario who managed a venue in Burlington, Ontario and founded Griffin Music. Personal information After attending Ellesmere College in Shropshire, where he studied Mathematics and Physics, he emigrated to Canada.Leblanc, L Godwin Turns Fandom into Business ‚Äì Billboard (28 Sep 1996) His third cousin was New Zealand military aviator James Gowing Godwin and Lt. Sidney Godwin, who rode with Marshall's Horse, was his great-grandfather. Music business In 1981, he managed the Orient Express night club, a venue in Burlington, Ontario where many world class rock acts performed including Rick Derringer, Steppenwolf, Joe Perry and Mountain. In 1983 Godwin turned to music management and assisted in the recording and production of albums by Michael White & The White. In 1987 he started the process to establish his own record label Griffin Music and his own book publishing company, Collector's Guide Publishing. In 1990 the first album by Michael White was released on Griffin Music. Over the next few years Griffin would release many classic rock acts' back-catalogs through Griffin, notably, the BBC in Concert series, Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe, David Bowie, Mot√∂rhead, Thin Lizzy, Mike Oldfield, Olivia Newton-John, Hawkwind, and Nazareth.Nickson, C Robert Godwin ‚Äì Discoveries: For Record & CD Collectors (June 1996) Author In 1984, Godwin wrote The Illustrated Led Zeppelin Collection a book for Led Zeppelin collectors. Books he authored between 1987 and 2007 include The Illustrated Collector's Guide to Led Zeppelin, The Illustrated Collector's Guide to Hawkwind, The Illustrated Collector's Guide to Kate Bush, Apollo 11 The First Men on the Moon, Project Apollo The Test Program, Project Apollo Exploring the Moon, Mars, The Lunar Exploration Scrapbook, Russian Spacecraft, Space Shuttle Fact Archive and The Making of Led Zeppelin IV. In 2005 Godwin co-authored Saturn with Alan Lawrie. The book won the Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best Presentation Written in 2006. In 2013 he co-authored a biography of Arthur C. Clarke with Fred Clarke, brother of Arthur. In 2014 he co-authored 2001 The Heritage and Legacy of the Space Odyssey with Frederick I. Ordway III, who was technical adviser to Stanley Kubrick for the film 2001 A Space Odyssey. Godwin also contributed feature articles to such publications as Goldmine (magazine)Hawkwind Sonic Assassins - Goldmine Vol 19 No 13 July 9, 1993 and Boeing Employee TimesDynaSoar Boeing's Lost Spacecraft - Employee Times Vol X No 1 Jan 2004Lunar Exploration Scrapbook - Vol XIII No 12 Dec 2007 In October 2015, Godwin wrote and published The First Scientific Concept of Rockets for Space Travel, an essay in which he asserted that a Scottish Presbyterian Minister and Canadian University Principal named William Leitch was the first scientist to determine, for the correct reasons, that rockets were the best method for powering space flight. Godwin's essay was publicly endorsed by Frank H. Winter, retired Curator of Rocketry at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, and by David Baker, editor of the British Interplanetary Society's magazine, Spaceflight. Leitch's proposal for rockets appeared in September 1861 in the magazine Good Words, effectively pre-dating the modern proponents of rocketry, such as Robert Hutchings Goddard and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky by more than three decades. In late 2016 Godwin released his findings as a book entitled William Leitch - Presbyterian Scientist & The Concept of Rocket Space Flight 1854-1864. Godwin co-authored Outpost in Orbit - An Oral and Pictorial History of the International Space Station with David Shayler in 2018. The book was written in cooperation with the ISS office at the Johnson Space Center under a NASA Space Agreement. Godwin's book Manned Lunar Landing & Return, released in March 2019, told the story of Project MALLAR, the 1959 plan for a manned lunar landing created by Conrad Lau, head of Advanced Projects at the Chance Vought Aircraft Company's Astronautics Division. Lau's report proposed a three module spacecraft system which would take two people to the lunar surface and use a technique known as lunar orbit rendezvous to return them to Earth. Godwin showed that Abe Silverstein, a senior NASA manager was given the report on January 12th 1960 and two weeks later instructed NASA's Advance Vehicle team to adopt this design for the Apollo spacecraft. Print publishing Between 1987 and 1998 Collector's Guide Publishing released books on many different rock artists including Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Kate Bush, Alice Cooper, Wishbone Ash and Kiss.

La gigantesca battaglia ingaggiata il 24 dello scorso ottobre ed alla quale prendevano parte cinquantuno divisioni italiane, tre britanniche, due francesi, una cecoslovacca ed un reggimento americano, contro settantatr√© divisioni austroungariche, √® finita. La fulminea e arditissima avanzata del XXIX Corpo d'Armata su Trento, sbarrando le vie della ritirata alle armate nemiche del Trentino, travolte ad occidente dalle truppe della VII armata e ad oriente da quelle della I, VI e IV, ha determinato ieri lo sfacelo totale del fronte avversario. Dal Brenta al Torre l'irresistibile slancio della XII, della VIII, della X armata e delle divisioni di cavalleria, ricaccia sempre pi√π indietro il nemico fuggente. Nella pianura, S.A.R. il Duca d'Aosta avanza rapidamente alla testa della sua invitta III armata, anelante di ritornare sulle posizioni da essa gi√† vittoriosamente conquistate, che mai aveva perdute. L'Esercito Austro-Ungarico √® annientato: esso ha subito perdite gravissime nell'accanita resistenza dei primi giorni e nell'inseguimento ha perdute quantit√† ingentissime di materiale di ogni sorta e pressoch√© per intero i suoi magazzini e i depositi. Ha lasciato finora nelle nostre mani circa trecentomila prigionieri con interi stati maggiori e non meno di cinquemila cannoni. I resti di quello che fu uno dei pi√π potenti eserciti del mondo risalgono in disordine e senza speranza le valli che avevano disceso con orgogliosa sicurezza. Il capo di stato maggiore dell'esercito, il generale Diaz =English= From the Supreme Headquarters 12:00 hours, November 4, 1918 The war against Austria-Hungary, which the Italian Army, inferior in number and equipment, began on 24 May 1915 under the leadership of His Majesty and supreme leader the King and conducted with unwavering faith and tenacious bravery without rest for 41 months, is won. The gigantic battle, which opened on the 24th of last October and in which fifty- one Italian divisions, three British, two French, one Czechoslovak and a US regiment joined against seventy-three Austrian divisions, is over. The lightning-fast and most audacious advance of the XXIX Army Corps on Trento, blocking the retreat of the enemy armies from Trentino, as they were overwhelmed from the west by the troops of the VII army and from the east by those of the I, VI, and the IV armies, led to the utter collapse of the enemy's front. From the Brenta to the Torre, the fleeing enemy is pushed ever further back by the irresistible onslaught of the XII, VIII, X Armies and of the cavalry divisions. In the plains, His Royal Highness the Duke of Aosta is advancing at the head of his undefeated III Army, eager to return to the previously successfully conquered positions, which they had never lost. The Austro-Hungarian Army is vanquished: it suffered terrible losses in the dogged resistance of the early days, and during the pursuit it lost an enormous quantity of materials of every kind as well as almost all its stockpiles and supply depots. The Austro-Hungarian Army has so far left about 300,000 prisoners of war in our hands along with multiple entire officer corps and at least 5,000 pieces of artillery. The remnants of what was one of the world's most powerful armies are returning in hopelessness and chaos up the valleys from which they had descended with boastful confidence.

It is a strong analgesic with around 4 times the potency of pethidine, and unlike pethidine, does not cause convulsions, although it produces the standard opioid side effects such as sedation and respiratory depression. Morpheridine is not currently used in medicine and is a Schedule I drug which is controlled under UN drug conventions. Synthesis Normeperidine synthesis: The key intermediate, normeperidine, is obtained by a scheme closely akin to the parent molecule. Thus, alkylation of benzyl cyanide (1) with the tosyl analog of the bischloroethylamine (2) leads to the substituted piperidine (3). Basic hydrolysis serves to convert the nitrile to the acid (4). Treatment of this last with sulfuric acid in ethanol serves both to esterify the acid and to remove the tosyl group to yield the secondary amine (5).

Early life Warren was born in Boston, Massachusetts, a great-great-grandson of Mercy Otis Warren and the son of lawyer Winslow Warren (collector of the Port of Boston) and Mary Lincoln Tinkham. The family moved to Dedham, Massachusetts when Charles was three, where his biographer notes the family \\"remained active and loyal Democrats in a bastion of Republicanism.\\"Michael Allen Wolf, Charles Warren, American National Biography, Vol 22, p. 703 (Oxford University Press, 1999) Following family tradition, he attended Harvard University, receiving an A.B. in 1889 and an A.M from Harvard Law School in 1892. Much later, in 1933, Warren would receive an honorary doctor of laws degree from Columbia Law School. Career Warren began practicing law in Boston in Moorfield Storey's firm, but left after less than a year to accept a job as the private secretary to Massachusetts governor William Eustis Russell. Warren was an active member of the Young Men's Democratic Club, but lost both his attempts to gain elective office (as state senator in 1894 and 1895). On May 31, 1894, Warren founded the Immigration Restriction League with his fellow Harvard graduates Prescott F. Hall and Robert DeCourcy Ward. The organization advocated excluding new immigrants from southern and eastern Europe because of their allegedly inferior \\"racial qualities\\" compared to Anglo-Saxons.Solomon, Barbara Miller: Ancestors and Immigrants. A Changing New England Tradition. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1956. Warren supported this cause by publishing short stories in national magazines including 'Scribner's,' 'McClure's,' and the 'Atlantic.' He also opposed women's suffrage, bimetallism, protectionism and imperialism.American National Biography at p. 703 The organization spread to other American cities, and lasted approximately two decades, disbanding after Hall's 1921 death. Warren joined Russell's law firm as an associate when the governor's term ended in 1894, and later formed Warren & Perry, where he practised law from 1897 to 1914. He handled various types of cases: criminal, real estate, domestic relations and corporate. His most famous case defended James Michael Curley, who was convicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States for taking the civil service examination for a constituent. In 1905, Warren became chair of the Massachusetts State Civil Service Commission, where he served until 1911, when a candidate backed by Martin Lomasney, one of the powerful machine politicians against which the patrician progressive worked, won.American National Biography at pp. 703-704 Warren then concentrated on his law practice and writing career, as well as became involved in national progressive politics. In addition to law review articles, Warren published two encyclopedic books which became the starting point for American legal historians for decades: History of the Harvard Law School and of Early Legal Conditions in America (3 Vol. 1909) and A History of the American Bar. Warren served on the Executive Committee of the Massachusetts Woodrow Wilson League in 1912. The successful Presidential candidate appointed Warren Assistant Attorney General, and he served from June 1914 to April 1918. The looming World War caused Warren to become involved in internal security and international relations matters\\"Bailly-Blanchard Named\\", The Washington Post, May 16, 1914, p. 4. \\"New Assistant Attorney General\\", The Washington Post, June 2, 1914, p. 2. \\"Says 20,000 Spies Infest New York\\", The Washington Post, April 20, 1918, p. 8. \\"Holds Up Treason Bill\\", The Washington Post, April 23, 1918, p. 2. including drafting the Espionage Act of 1917. Warren also drafted legal briefs and argued before the United States Supreme Court approximately 30 times. After the war (and Wilson's death), Warren remained in Washington, D.C. and received several appointments as special master from the Supreme Court for disputes involving state boundaries and water rights. The State Department also consulted Warren concerning neutrality matters in the 1930s. Publication of his three-volume History of the United States Supreme Court in 1922 cemented Warren's reputation as a legal scholar, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1923. Warren disagreed with historian Charles A. Beard's economic analysis of the Constitution published in 1912, but by 1925 as a progressive Warren agreed that the court's conservative analysis was strait-jacketing Congress, a theme he elaborated in Congress, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court. Justice Louis Brandeis cited the work (revised in 1935) in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), which cut back on forum-shopping by wealthy litigants using the old case of Swift v. Tyson (1842). Warren also published Bankruptcy in United States History in 1935, based on lectures he had given at Northwestern University School of Law. Other schools at which the legal historian lectured included the University of Rochester, Boston University School of Law, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Virginia, the University of Chicago, and several others. Warren retired from public service in the 1940s. He married Annie Louise Bliss in 1904, and they celebrated their fiftieth anniversary before his death, although they had no children. Death and legacy Warren died in Washington, D.C.. A window in the National Cathedral is dedicated in his memory, above a commemorative plaque. At his alma mater, the research center for North American history, funded by his widow, is named after Warren. The Library of Congress received many of his papers.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2012/ms012024.pdf His autobiographical notes are held by the Massachusetts Historical Society and Columbia University's Oral History Collection.

It was established by Father Joseph Pelnar in 1894. Grading curriculum ranges from Pre-K to 12th grade.  History  St. Joseph School was founded by Father Joseph Pelnar in 1894. The first academy was originally located in Galveston but was later moved to Bryan after the hurricane of 1900, and the Ursuline Sisters were placed in charge of the school. The Villa Maria Convent was built on St. Ursula's Hill, a mile northeast of St. Joseph Catholic Church. In 1926, the Villa Maria Academy was closed after 25 years in Bryan, and the Sisters of the Incarnate Word of Houston succeeded the Ursuline Sisters as teachers at St. Joseph's Parochial School. Because of growth in the parish, additional classrooms were required.

This new building was dedicated in 1960.St. Joseph Catholic Church History In the early 1990s, St. Joseph Catholic School purchased what is now the Elementary Campus from Bryan ISD. In 2001, St. Joseph purchased the property on Coulter Street in Bryan of Central Baptist Church to make room for a growing population of students. Central Baptist in turn constructed a new sanctuary at 1991 FM 158, the farm-to-market road which leads to Huntsville.

St. Joseph School purchased the building from Bryan ISD in the 1990. It was originally built as a public elementary school, Travis Elementary, and has been continually in use for over 75 years. The building consists of two floors of classrooms, a gym, a cafeteria, and several reference rooms (including a library, a computer lab, and a religious education office). The Elementary Campus completed the addition of another wing and multi-purpose room in time for the 2010-2011 school year.  Secondary campus  Christ the Good Shepherd Chapel of St. Joseph Catholic School is the former sanctuary of the large Central Baptist Church, relocated to 1991 FM 158 in northeastern Bryan. The secondary campus, serving grades 6 through 12, was obtained in 2001, from Central Baptist Church. The former Central Baptist sanctuary was renamed Christ the Good Shepherd Chapel. This campus consists of two buildings: the main building and a multi-purpose gymnasium. The main building contains the chapel, a biology lab, chemistry lab, band hall, art room, computer lab, library, and 14 classrooms. To the north is the Junior High School wing, and to the south is the High School wing.

Chuck insists on buying Gracie's birthday cake, and Montana offers to give Gracie and her friends makeovers. Meanwhile, it's Gary's anniversary, but the seemingly simple task of getting home is made nearly impossible by the WURG team. Also, the WURG team all end up in Kelly's house cornering a fierce raccoon in Kelly's living room. As a result of this, the raccoon inadvertently sets Kelly's sofa alight. Reception =Controversies= After the airing of the episode, a scene involving Marsh trying to convince the show's lone Polish character, Gary, to go bowling after work by saying: \\"Come on, it's in your blood, like Kielbasa and collaborating with the Nazis.\\" caused controversy among some Poles and Polish-Americans. The characterisation of all Poles as having collaborated with the invading German Nazis offended many Poles, who felt that such mockery was unacceptable in light of the Polish casualties during WW2. Many felt that it also ignored the millions of Poles who fought against the Nazis for six years during World War II, compared to the thousands who collaborated with them. Fox later delivered a public apology on November 20, 2007. They vowed never to air the line of dialog again in repeats and/or syndicated broadcasts. Fox stated that, \\"The line was delivered by a character known for being ignorant, clueless and for saying outlandish things. Allowing the line to remain in the show, however, demonstrated poor judgment, and we apologize to anyone who was offended.\\" Furthermore, some critics and many viewers noticed that a large part of the plot was taken from a popular story from the radio program This American Life.

Originally named Memory III, the vessel was renamed Elfreda while in private use as a personal yacht. After her commissioning and renaming to Caribou, she was used as a patrol and training vessel on the East coast of Canada. Following the war the ship was sold for commercial use until her registry was deleted in 1963. Description As built the yacht was long between perpendiculars with a beam of . The vessel had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 306 and was powered by a diesel engine driving two shafts. As an armed yacht, Caribou was long overall with a beam of and a draught of . Caribou had a maximum speed of and was armed with one QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun and depth charges. The vessel was equipped with an ASDIC set for anti-submarine warfare. In Canadian service the ship had a complement of 5 officers and 35 crew. Service history =As a yacht= Constructed by Defoe Shipbuilding Co. at Bay City, Michigan with the yard number 126, the yacht was launched in 1928 as Memory III on behalf of A.E. Fitkin and registered in New York City. The vessel was sold to Sherburn M. Becker in 1930, retaining the name Memory III and remained registered in New York City. Becker sold the yacht in 1933 to H.B.H. Ripley of New York City, who renamed her Elfreda. =In Canadian service= After failing to acquire any British vessels at the outset of the Second World War for auxiliary purposes, the Royal Canadian Navy discreetly searched the American market for suitable ships. However, American law prevented the sale of ships for possible use in the war to any of the belligerents. The Royal Canadian Navy, requisitioned unsuitable Canadian yachts and had their respective owners go the United States and buy those ships the Navy wanted as replacements. Once the ships arrived in Canada, the navy then returned the original yachts and requisitioned the new ones. Elfreda was one such ship and was acquired and renamed Marita II before being handed over to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1940. Renamed Caribou and commissioned at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 27 May 1940 with the pennant number S12, later Z25, the ship sailed to Quebec City, Quebec for conversion to an armed yacht. There the 12-pounder naval gun was installed forward. Upon her return to Halifax following the conversion, the vessel was employed as a guard ship at the entrance to Bedford Basin. In August 1941, Caribou underwent a refit. After returning to service in November, she was used as a patrol vessel. On 19 November 1941 the ship had a serious galley fire that sent her back to harbour until February 1942. In March 1942 the ship was re-assigned to the patrol force operating out of Saint John, New Brunswick. She and fellow armed yacht were the only warships patrolling the Bay of Fundy and the approaches to Saint John until the arrival of motor launches in October. She remained with the force until 31 July 1942 when the vessel returned to Halifax for inspection and was found unfit. Caribou was then assigned to harbour duty as a training ship as part of . She remained in this capacity until September 1943 when she moved first to Saint John as a training ship. The ship finished the war as a training ship at Digby, Nova Scotia. She was paid off on 20 July 1945 and put up for disposal on 4 September 1945 along with . The vessel sold for commercial use in 1946. =Postwar service= Caribou was sold along with armed yachts Husky and to the Margaree Steamships Company.

The game was released exclusively in Japan on March 4, 2010. Set in a fictional version of the year 2020, .hack//Link's story takes place in a new version of ‚ÄúThe World,‚Äù a popular series of MMORPGs known as The World: RX. The game focuses on a young man named Tokio Kuryuu, a second year junior-high student who gets transported into The World: RX by a new student named Saika Amagi. After arriving into the game, Tokio is tasked by an artificial intelligence version of the character Kite to be a hero and use a tower of the Akashic Records to save the Twilight Knights, a group of artificial intelligence versions of characters based on casts of previous entries in the .hack series. Using the Akashic Records, Tokio is able to travel backwards in time to previous .hack entries and encounter past characters in order to unfreeze the data of the Twilight Knights. Since its release, .hack//LINK has been met with negative to mixed reception among both critics and fans alike. With many praising the expansion of the series' overall lore, but with strong criticism towards the gameplay of the title. Although never stated to be the final chapter to the .hack series, the game is currently the last game in the chronology of the series to bear the name of .hack. The game was eventually followed with future installments known as Guilty Dragon: The Sin Dragon and the Eight Curses and New World Vol. 1: Maiden of Silver Tears for both iOS and Android platforms. Both games have since had their services discontinued. Plot The story takes place in the year 2020. Tokio Kuryuu is a normal middle-school student who loves to play games. One day, a transfer student named Saika Amagi approaches Tokio and takes him to the school rooftop where she sends Tokio directly into The World R:X. There, he finds Kite, the legendary hero and leader of Twilight Knight dedicated to protect The World fighting against Fl√ºgel, the leader of a mysterious group called Schicksal. During their battle, Kite protected Tokio from Fl√ºgel's attack, resulting Kite's PC to be frozen but not before he asked Tokio to save them. Tokio is then transported to Saika's hideout, Grand Whale, and forcefully makes him her slave to find four items called Chrono Cores that are necessary to fully control the Akashic Record, a god-like power that holds over the system of The World and enables them to travel to the past data of The World. Using the Akashic Record, Tokio and Saika travels throughout the past timelines of .hack series to find the Chrono Cores and restored the frozen data of all members of Twilight Knights, gaining new allies in the process. During their journey, Tokio befriends AIKA, a benevolent AIDA-PC that greatly resembles Saika whom the latter introduces as some sort of her alter ego. Saika also reveals that the reason she's gather Chrono Cores is because her cousin, Jyotaro Amagi, has sent her an email that tells her to save him by gathering all the Chrono Cores. One of Schicksal members, Geist, for some reason has been indirectly helping Tokio to get the Chrono Cores and at the same time getting rid of his own Schicksal comrades who were getting on Tokyo's way. The mystery behind Tokio's ability to directly entering the game is revealed because he is a Doubleware, a special kind of human who has the ability to real digitise himself into network. Near reaching the top of Akashic Record, Tokio are confronted by the five remaining members of Schicksal. However, two of the members, Metronome and Geist betrays Fl√ºgel, allowing Tokio and Saika to reach the core of Akashic Records where they finds Aura trapped inside by Schicksal who reveals that they have been tricked. At this time, a virus suddenly came out from Tokio's body and slowly corrupting Aura. Geist reveals that he was the one who sent the email and the R:X disk to Saika by posing as Jyotaro so that he could corrupt Aura by using Tokio's power as a Doubleware combined with the virus that he implanted inside Tokio from the disk. Now working together with Fl√ºgel and the remaining members of Schicksal, Tokio confronts and defeats Geist who reveals that he was planning to bring forth Immortal Dusk, a plan to real digitize all humanity that started by his creator, Jyotaro, but Fl√ºgel reveals that the plan was a failure, and Jyotaro had been the very first victim of the plan, resulting him to be in coma for years. Aura, who was completely corrupted, begins her onslaught throughout the network and begins to real digitise all humanity as a form of her twisted love for The World. Hoping to return Aura to normal, Tokio and all the revived Twilight Knights confronts Aura and uses the vaccines program that Saika has created to restore her. Unfortunately, the vaccine isn't enough to destroy the virus inside Aura, and one by one Tokio's friend was defeated. To save everyone, AIKA sacrifices herself to restore Aura's data and disappears. After the incident, Saika suddenly disappears, prompting Tokio to ask Fl√ºgel for help to locate her and finds her at a hospital where she is tending Jyotaro. Saika reveals her guilt for involving Tokio and blames herself for AIKA's death so she tries her best to just forget everything that happens and hopes for Tokio to do the same. Tokio refuses and convinces Saika that everything that happened are too meaningful and precious to be forgotten, telling her there's no need for her to bear the sadness alone. Tokio and Saika reaffirms their friendship, both determines to overcome their sadness over AIKA's death.

After the release of the third volume on February 26, 2010, the manga adaptation of .hack//LINK was discontinued for unknown reasons. =Release= Reception Reaction to .hack//Link has been moderate to negative among both critics and fans alike. Famitsu magazine has commented that while Link's story is deep and engaging the gameplay itself is shallow and boring. The juggle combo feature in battles has been said to be fun on the first try but that over the course of the game many simply ignored it. The large cast has been praised by fans for the return of many classic characters, but many complain that some of the new X-forms are not required and that they ruin the flair. Heath Hindman, in RPGLand.com's review, shared many of these complaints in addition to ones regarding a \\"dreadful camera\\" and repetition \\"on a whole new level,\\" among others. Hindman did have high praise for the story, however, saying, \\"It ties up many loose ends while adding a bit more info and detail to the world of The World. Moreover, it does so while managing to give a shout out to practically every major .hack side project and providing a great mix of fan service and real quality work\\". Ultimately, despite the story's strength, the .hack//Link's high number of game-breaking faults got it an overall rating of \\"Horrible.\\" Spin-off material In 2009 Namco Bandai Games announced at Tokyo Game Show that an all CG anime-series \\"tie-in\\" is going to be produced. Not many details were known other than it was not going to be a television series. They also announced that CyberConnect2's team \\"sai\\" is the production force for the CG film. Later a 2D anime Original Video Animation series known as .hack//Quantum, produced by Kinma Citrus was announced with a subsequent 3DCGI movie known as .hack//The Movie being produced by CyberConnect 2 Sai.

Most universities in the world are organised into teaching and research divisions. Professors and lecturers will normally be contracted to do both and, in theory at least, course syllabi are structured around the teacher's research interests. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to further integrate the two activities. This has led to a new interest in undergraduate research, where students enrolled on bachelor's degrees are given the opportunity to participate in research projects or undertake their own research. This concept is also coined as Teaching-as-Research or Research-based Practices in Teaching in higher education. There are growing number of activities supported and sponsored by inter-university organizations such as the National Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network. Worldwide This practice was pioneered in America, where there is now a nationwide Council for Undergraduate Research, and in Australia. Recently, the UK Government funded several 'centres of excellence' which focus in different ways on undergraduate research. One of the most important is the Reinvention Centre for Undergraduate Research, which was set up in the Sociology department at Warwick University in partnership with the School of the Built Environment at Oxford Brookes University under the directorship of Mike Neary. The Centre's journal, Reinvention, launched in September 2007. In 2006, the UK Government also invested c.¬£25m into universities across the country to strengthen research-informed teaching. Key publications by Alan Jenkins, Roger Zetter, Mick Healey and Angela Brew have further developed the research base for research-informed teaching. In April 2007 the University of Central Lancashire appointed the first ever Chair in Research-informed Teaching, Stuart Hampton- Reeves, and in September 2007 launched a Centre for Research-informed Teaching. Efficacy While university instruction is optimal when grounded in empirical findings, some concerns have arisen regarding the efficacy of university instruction at research focused institutions. A growing number of these higher education research institutions focus on the researching prowess of the potential professor (and, in many cases, the grant-writing ability of prospective employee) while often paying substantially less attention to one's ability to disseminate the information. Of course, those talented instructors who are both strong in research and instruction have the potential to really impact their students.

They are also known as the Wamba-Wamba. Language Wemba-Wemba bears strong similarities to Woiwurrung. When Moravian missionaries came and started to learn a language in Wembawemba territory, at Archibald Macarthur Camppbell's Gannawarra station, they quickly noted that the natives, perceiving they were understood, slipped into using another language, not willing to allow this \\"cultural conquest\\" to enable the whitemen to learn of matters they wished to keep secret from outsiders. Country Before European settlement in the nineteenth century, the Wemba-Wemba occupied the area around the Loddon River, reaching northwards from Kerang, Victoria to Swan Hill, and including the area of the Avoca River, southwards towards Quambatook. In a northeasterly direction, their territory ran up, over the New South Wales-Victorian border to Booroorban and Moulamein, and extended to the vicinity of Barham. Lake Boga and Boora in Victoria also fell within their domain. The overall extension of their territory has been calculated by Norman Tindale to be roughly . Social structure The Wembawemba were registered as consisting of five hordes. Stone lists these hordes, residing around Towaninny, Meelool Station (with a name indicating they were thought to be quarrelsome), Lake Boga, Gonn on the Murray River (called the Dietjenbaluk (\\"always on the move\\"), and Bael Bael.

Spieseke, convinced that the Wembawemba, whom they called culli, were \\"the most wretched and bleakest (people), who live on God's earth\\", established Lake Boga mission in 1851. The mission closed in 1856 due to lack of converts, disputes with local authorities and hostilities from local landholders.

The phrase was originally used with reference to Roman Catholic, and later Protestant, mission stations in the Western United States. In the 1960s, missiologists began to re-employ the term to distinguish between two kinds of missionary work: that which was being done among peoples where the indigenous church was already established, and new efforts among peoples where the Christian Church was very weak or non- existent. The contemporary usage of the term is part of a general trend to look at the missionary task more in terms of social, cultural and linguistic isolation from the gospel, rather than strictly geographic isolation. Examples of societies that focus on this sort of missionary work are Frontiers and Anglican Frontier Missions.

Rohullah worked as a driver before being seized at his farm in Jalalabad in August 2006. Identity A captive was held in the United States' Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, named Sahib Rohullah Wakil, a member of Afghanistan's legislature, who is also known as \\"Haji Rohullah\\". On January 16, 2010, the Department of Defense was forced to publish the names of the 645 captives held in the Bagram Theater Internment Facility. Three of the individuals on the list were named Rohullah. The list distinguished between them solely by a sequence number: 003417, 003830, and 003841\\\\. Capture and detention When Rohullah's writ of habeas corpus was first filed, in 2006, it stated he had been captured in his home a year earlier. Eleven other men were captured at the same time, but they were all released. Ruzatullah v. Gates Rohullah is one of the first enemy combatants held by the USA in a detention facility in Afghanistan who has been held able to mount a challenge to his detention through the US court system. Rohullah, and another Afghan, Ruzatullah, had a writ of habeas corpus submitted on their behalf in November 2006. On August 10, 2007 Rohullah's lawyers submitted a motion requiring the United States Department of Defense give thirty days' advance notice if they planned to transfer him from US custody to Afghan custody. They informed the court that Ruzatullah was quietly transferred out of US jurisdiction, without any notice, in June 2007. The arguments in the motion were: #Petitioner Rohullah Will Suffer Irreparable Harm if He is Transferred Without Notice or an Opportunity to be Heard ## Petitioner Ruzatullah Faces the Threat of Irreparable Harm Based on the Potential Loss of his Habeas Claims ## Petitioner Rohoullah Faces the Substantial Threat of Torture #Petitioner Rohullah Has a Substantial Likelihood of Success on the Merits #The Requested Relief Will Not Harm Respondents #Public Policy Unequivocally Favors the Granting of Petitioner's Request Rohullah and Ruzatullah are represented by A. Katherine Toomey, Eric L. Lewis and Dwight P. Bostwick of Baach, Robinson & Lewis and Tina Foster of the International Justice Network. Jean Lin, a Justice Department attorney, had characterized the motion as ab \\"extraordinary and drastic remedy.\\" Lin had argued the motion would: \\"... interfere directly with the executive's conduct of war-making and foreign policy.\\" On October 4, 2007 U.S. district court judge Gladys Kessler ruled in Rohullah's favor that the DoD had to give his lawyer's thirty days advance notice of plans to transfer him from US custody. On December 2, 2008 Sandra Hodgkinson, who was then the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, had a letter to the editor published in American Law, responding to Daphne Eviatar's article on Bagram captivity.

His former fianc√©e, Mechele Linehan, and former roommate, John Carlin, were convicted of murdering him in 2007, but the judgments were reversed on appeal. Carlin died in prison in 2008 and Alaska prosecutors ultimately decided against indicting Linehan a second time.  Kent Leppink's murder  Kent Leppink was a Michigan native who moved to Alaska to work as a fisherman. He met Linehan at a striptease club. Between 1994 and 1996, Linehan was romantically involved with Leppink and a man named John Carlin at the same time. For several months the three lived in the same house in Anchorage. On May 2, 1996, Leppink (age 36) was found dead in Hope, Alaska, with three .44 caliber Desert Eagle gunshot wounds. Linehan was arrested over 10 years later in October 2006 and convicted of his murder on October 22, 2007, but the verdict was overturned in February 2010.  Trial and appeal  At trial, Linehan was accused of conspiring with John Carlin to kill Leppink. The government said that Linehan's motive was that she was the beneficiary of Leppink's $1 million life insurance policy. Leppink changed the beneficiary on the policy a few days before his death. On October 22, 2007, Linehan was convicted of murder. On April 2, 2008, she was sentenced to 99 years and transferred to Hiland Mountain Correctional Center in Eagle River, Alaska. Carlin had also been convicted of murder in April 2007. He was found bludgeoned to death in his cell at the Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward, Alaska, on October 27, 2008. His conviction was reversed on January 21, 2015. Because Carlin died while his case was under appeal, his estate was allowed to continue the appeal.Estate of John Carlin III v. State of Alaska Alaska Supreme Court. 21 January 2015. On February 5, 2010, the Alaska Court of Appeals overturned Linehan's conviction.Michele K. Linehan v. State of Alaska. Alaska Court of Appeals Opinion The court concluded it was improper for the trial court to allow two pieces of evidence into the trial: testimony about the movie The Last Seduction, and a letter written by Leppink in the days before he died. The letter, which Leppink wrote to his parents, said Linehan, Carlin, or Scott Hilke were \\"probably\\" responsible if he died under \\"suspicious circumstances\\". Until May 11, 2010, Linehan was incarcerated at Hiland Mountain Correctional Center. On April 28, 2010, a judge set a $250,000 appearance bond as a condition of her bail. On May 11, 2010, an east coast corporate executive, Brian C. Watt, from Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, donated the money necessary to release Linehan from prison, paying a $25,000 bail bondsman fee. On December 13, 2011, Anchorage Superior Court Judge Philip Volland dismissed the murder indictment against Linehan.

It was primarily influenced by the collectivist ideas that inspired the Cuban Revolution of 1933. Widely considered one of the most progressive constitutions at the time, it provided for land reform, public education, a minimum wage and other social programs. It had 286 articles in 19 sections. Origins Despite the fact that some political parties had refused to participate in some elections in anticipation of fraud by the government in power, all parties presented candidates for the election of a Constitutional Assembly in November 1939. Beneath the variety of parties, the two national leaders who had dominated Cuban politics since the ouster of Gerardo Machado in 1933: former President Ram√≥n Grau and Fulgencio Batista, a military leader who had dominated several recent presidents. Each maneuvered to form coalitions, but public interest was only sufficient to produce a turnout of 57% of the eligible voters. The 76 delegates from nine political parties first elected Grau chairman, but he was removed when the Conservative Party delegates, who had campaigned in opposition to Batista, switched sides and supported Batista's candidate for chairman, Carlos M√°rquez Sterling. The assembly debated publicly for six months and adopted the constitution at the Capitol in Havana. It was signed on 1 July 1940, in Gu√°imaro, Camag√ºey, as a tribute to the anti-colonial revolutionaries who signed a draft of a proposed Cuban constitution there in 1869. A later U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Philip Bonsal assessed the outcome: For example, the Constitution established as national policy restrictions on the size of land holdings and an end to common ownership of sugar plantations and sugar mills, but these principles were never translated into legislation. Provisions The Constitution of 1940 (a) substantiated voting as a right, obligation and function of the people; (b) endorsed the previously established form of government, specifically republican, democratic and representative; (c) confirmed individual rights and privileges including private property rights; and (d) introduced the notion of collective rights. Under the Constitution of 1940, the separation between the three branches of government remained, but with obvious distinctions: (a) the role of the prime minister was introduced; (b) the executive branch converted to semi-parliamentary form, where half of its ministers could also be congressmen; and (c) Congress‚Äô form was changed to one member in the house for every 35,000 citizens or greater fraction of 17,500, and nine senators per province. The Constitution of 1940 ratified the authority and independence of the judiciary. Specifically, the judicial branch remained autonomous and empowered to nominate judges and magistrates. Like the Constitution of 1901, and the U.S. Constitution, Supreme Court justices were appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate. In addition, the Constitution of 1940 instituted a Court of Constitutional and Social Guarantees, known as the Constitutional Court, under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court was empowered to hear labor and constitutional law disputes and to set remedies for violations. Under the Constitution of 1940, provincial government was terminated. The provincial councils endured, but were now composed of the mayors of various municipalities incorporated into each province. The governor‚Äôs power to suspend mayors ceased, while the municipalities gained the right to impose local taxes. Public expenses and budgeting at all levels became subject to a ministerial officer under the auspices of a new Court of Public Administration. A Court of Public Works was instituted. The constitutional amendment clause was strictly enforced in the Constitution of 1940. A constitutional convention was required to modify the language of the Constitution. Congress was authorized to make minor reforms to the document, provided that the following requirements were adhered to: (a) quorum (joint session); (b) two thirds vote of the total number of legislators; and (c) proposed amendments needed to be approved at two consecutive legislative sessions. The Constitution of 1940 could also be modified via referendum. The most notable difference between the Constitution of 1901 and the Constitution of 1940 was the addition of constitutional protection for issues relating to family, culture, property and labor. Without constitutional antecedents and expertise in the area of protection of social rights, the drafters of the Constitution of 1940 used as models the Second Spanish Republic's Constitution of 1931 and Germany's Weimar Constitution. History The Constitution of 1940 was in effect for 12 years until, in 1952, following a coup d'√©tat by Fulgencio Batista, parts of it were suspended. In 1953, Fidel Castro's manifesto \\"History Will Absolve Me\\" declared the restoration of the 1940 Constitution one of the principal aims of his revolutionary movement.History Will Absolve Me (The complete speech), accessed 12 January 2016 In 1957, he and two of his fellow revolutionaries in the \\"Manifesto of Sierra Maestra\\" announced their intention to restore the 1940 Constitution should they succeed in defeating the Batista dictatorship. They delayed doing so until 1976. A referendum that year approved the adoption of a new constitution, the 1976 Constitution of Cuba, which defined the country as a one-party state under the Communist Party of Cuba and replaced the office of Prime Minister of Cuba with an executive president.

It is found in a situation when part of some information is shared among group members (i.e. all members possess this information prior to discussion), whereas other pieces of information are unshared (i.e. information known to only one member prior to discussion). Furthermore, shared information and unshared information have different decisional implications, and the alternative implied by the unshared information is the correct one given all information available to the group. However, no group member can detect this best solution on the basis of her or his individual information prior to discussion; it can only be found by pooling the unshared information during group discussion. This topic is one of many topics studied in social psychology. History In 1981 two researchers, Garold Stasser and William Titus, set out to challenge strongly-held beliefs about group decision making. The researchers attempted to use a number of formal models to identify what would happen when people are not fully informed. One of these was the persuasive argument theory (PAT). The theory, in this case, would state that polarization of judgments is due to culturally pooled arguments. This will bolster popularly held beliefs and arguments, yet not take into account unshared information. The novelty of arguments, on the other hand, does create change, but PAT assumes they are consistent with the norm. Stasser and Titus posit that this is not always the case. Through providing selective, unique information, they felt they could separate informational influence and normative influence. Though they ultimately found opposing results, they had devised hidden profiles. Causes Hidden profiles occur when some information is shared among group members and other pieces of information remain unshared. This phenomenon has a tendency to co-occur and interact with the shared information bias to produce poor decisions. Though each person in a group will have unique knowledge, group members will have the propensity to discuss already shared information. The motivation to do so will be to reach a consensus. This, however, does not yield the optimal decision choice. Initial decision preferences differ from what is ideal, but integrating the unique knowledge of individual group members will allow the optimal decision to be realized. Stewart and Stasser (1998) state that shared information bias, and in turn hidden profiles, occur more often for judgment-based tasks because of the ultimate goal of reaching consensus. To support this, a meta-analysis of information sharing and teams by Mesmer-Magnus and DeChurch (2009) found that information sharing most affected intellectual tasks. These findings supported Laughlin‚Äôs (1980, 1996) claim that intellectual tasks require more information sharing. That is, tasks featuring a hidden profile were less affected by the shared information bias when they were intellectually based (i.e., goal of correctness) rather than judgmentally based (i.e., goal of consensus). One issue with hidden profiles is the time dedicated to discussion. Shared and unshared information are markedly different in the amount time each is debated in group discussion. In other words, shared information is discussed far more often than novel, unshared information. This unbalanced approach to group decision making does not yield optimal decision choices. This effect is even more prominent for judgmental tasks, as discussed above. Due to this, though an optimal decision is attainable, it will likely not be realized. In hidden profile situations, groups rarely find the alternative decision, likely the optimal one.Fiedler, K., Juslin, P. (Eds.). (2006). Information Sampling and Adaptive Cognition. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. One‚Äôs affect may also have an effect. When in a group setting, the unbalanced time dedication to shared information may be due to the uncomfortable nature of sharing novel, unique information. Discussing shared information can help to enhance other‚Äôs evaluation of a person, while unique information may impair on evaluation. As well, affect does influence reception of knowledge. In a series of studies, it was found that knowledge transfer of novel ideas is greater for those with a positive affect rather than those with a negative affect. This trend does not implicate the sender of information, but the receiver. However, if pairs are affect-congruent (negative-negative, positive-positive) rather than affect- incongruent, knowledge transfer is greater.

Biography Brefeld was a native of Telgte. He studied pharmacy in Heidelberg and Berlin, and afterwards served as an assistant to Anton de Bary (1831-1888) at the University of Halle. In 1878 he became a lecturer of botany at the Eberswalde Forestry Academy at Eberswalde, and in 1882 was a professor of botany at the University of M√ºnster, as well as manager of its botanical gardens. In 1898 he succeeded Ferdinand Cohn (1828-1898) as professor at the University of Breslau. In 1898 Brefeld was stricken by glaucoma, and subsequently became totally blind. His eye problems caused him to retire from the university in 1909. Brefeld was a prolific author of works in the field of mycology, being remembered for his writings on the heteroecious nature of fungal rusts and smuts. He pioneered culture techniques in the growth of fungi (using gelatin as a solid media),Google Books An Introduction To Mycology by R. S. Mehrotra, K. R. Aneja and in doing so, was able to study the life histories and systematic relationships of different groups of fungi.One Hundred and One Botanists by Duane Isely (biography) He is credited with providing nomenclature for a number of genera and species of fungi. The names Conidiobolus, Heterobasidion, Oligoporus and Polysphondylium (genus of slime mold) are a few of genera that he described. He is remembered for his disagreements with Anton de Bary in regards to the nature of yeasts as well as to the sexual nature of fungi (Brefeld maintained that higher fungi were devoid of sexuality). The genus Brefeldia from the family Stemonitidae is named after him.

History Rawbank was launched in 2002 by Rawholding s.a., the Holding that is commonly called Rawji Group, owned by The Rawji brothers, namely Mushtaque, Mazhar, Aslam and Murtaza. The history of the Rawji group begins at the beginning of the 20th century, when Merali Rawji (father of the Mushtaque siblings) settled in Kindu, then in Kalemie and later in Kisangani, in the eastern part of what was then Belgian Congo. The family made money in the coffee and cocoa trading business. In 1966, it acquired Beltexco, a distributor of FMCG consumer goods (Fast Moving Consumer Goods), a move that will turn them from successful entrepreneurs to a wealthy family. The directors of this group of companies are descendants of the founder (Merali Rawji). They grew up in Africa, but went to Europe to complete their studies. In the late 1990s, the war rocked the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but the Rawji continued their business activities. They set up in the capital, Kinshasa, and continued to diversify their portfolio of activities, adding up Prodimpex (Vehicle and machinery importer), a soap and cosmetics manufacturing company, Marsavco, a Unilever subsidiary in DRC, and others. Rawholding S.A. registered in Luxemburg, is a diversified group of companies Holding invested in banking, cosmetics, real estate, and international trade. Operations Rawbank is a full-service financial institution offering fully fledged retail, commercial and corporate banking services. It is a member of the SWIFT interbank network. Rawbank was started by five brothers. The conglomerate that owns the bank is called Groupe Rawji (Rawji Group of Companies), one of DR Congo's leading conglomerates, jointly owned by brothers: (a) Mazhar Rawji (b) Mushtaque Rawji (c) Aslam Rawji and (d) Murtaza Rawji. , Rawbank was the largest commercial bank in DR Congo, with 24 percent of banking assets in the country and a customer base of nearly of 300,000 accounts. Rawbank was the first financial house in DR Congo to offer mortgages to the public in 2015. , sixty percent of Rawbank's customers maintained retail accounts. The introduction of mobile money accounts has enabled the bank to attract clients in remote locations, as has the introduction internet banking. The bank is growing its clientele by focusing on (i) the un-banked population (b) young people (c) small to medium- sized businesses and (d) businesses owned by women.

Tyana increased in prominence when Roman Emperor Valens divided Cappadocia into two provinces and Tyana became the capital of Cappadocian Secundus in 371. This led to the conflict with Basil of Caesarea (the previous capital of the combined Cappadocia), who had only become bishop there in 370, for which Anthimus of Tyana is best known. Anthimus asserted that the change in his city's political status should be matched with a change in its religious status and declared himself in authority over several Cappadocian towns in his new province which had previously been under Basil's oversight. His success in enforcing these claims within his province was aided by the presence of Arians who did not wish to be under Basil's authority, though the evidence points against Anthimus himself being Arian.See footnote 190; Gregory of Nazianzus described Anthimus as a follower of Ares (the Greek god of war), not a follower of Arius. The reference seems to be to his fierce conduct regarding Basil's attempt to reach the monastery of St. Orestes http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.vi.i.vii.html The conflict became physical at one point when Basil and his friend Gregory of Nazianzus set out with a mule train to collect supplies from the monastery of St. Orestes, which was under Basil's authority. Some of Anthimus' retainers blocked their path close to St. Orestes, near Sasima, and a scuffle broke out. In 372 as a part of the conflict Basil set up Gregory of Nazianzus as bishop of the small town of Sasima which Anthimus claimed authority over. It was little more than a junction of roadsthe site linked Doara in the north and Tyana in the south, and had one road heading west to Nazianzus http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.vi.i.vii.html and previously had no bishop. Now it gained a bishop from each side, with Anthimus' choice staying. Likewise Basil made his younger brother Gregory bishop of Nyssa to aid in the conflict. He attempted to establish his authority at Doara by similar means. Basil and Anthimus later settled their differences; Eusebius of Samosata seems to have mediated the conflict and each bishop was accepted as having authority over his own region. At some point in the process Nazianzus was acknowledged to owe its allegiance to Tyana. Before complete peace came to prevail between Anthimus and Basil a new upset emerged with Basil over Anthimus' willingness to accept a candidate named Faustus for installation as a bishop in Armenia. Faustus had first come to Basil and been turned down until such time as Theodotus of Nicopolis and other Armenian bishops could be consulted, but upon turning to Anthimus he received his request.Discussed in a letter of Basil to Poemenius, bishop of Satala http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxxiii.html In any case by 375 Gregory considered Anthimus to be in complete agreement with him. Anthimus was described as elderly when this conflict began, and we hear little more of him after its end. The most significant impact of these events was a break in affection between Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil over the pressure Basil had placed on him to take his new role. That break lasted to Basil's death in 379.

Distribution The plant is native to the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is also cultivated in these regions, as it does best in their climates and in local calcareous soils. It requires less irrigation than many other crops, due to its adaptation to life in an arid region. Description Physaria fendleri is a perennial plant in natural habitats. It is cultivated as a winter annual. It produces hairless capsules called siliques which contain 6 to 25 seeds each. Uses The species is best known as the richest source of bladderpod oil. Most Physaria species contain the hydroxy acid lesquerolic acid in their oil with a seed oil content of ~24%. This oil is useful as a replacement for castor oil in some applications due to its ability to form estolides. If the plant becomes more widely cultivated and breeding and refinement techniques are improved, the oil could be used in a number of industries, including cosmetics, coatings, plastics, and lubricants. One obstacle to use is the oil's reddish-brown color, which makes it less valuable for certain applications than the colorless or pale yellow castor oil. Breeding may reduce the pigment load of the plant's oils over time. Breeding may also favor other characteristics in this species, such as its capacity for cultivation in other climates, male sterility to allow better control of pollination, and tolerance for a wider array of soil types. The plant has uses beyond its oil. The seed coat of P. fendleri also contains a useful natural gum which might be viable as a food additive similar to xanthan gum. The mash is high in protein, and has a similar proportion of various amino acids to the soybean. It may prove to be a good animal fodder.

He represented Drayton Valley-Calmar and sat as a Progressive Conservative from 2001 until 2008. Early life Abbott was born November 24, 1966 in York County, Ontario. In 1988 he graduated from Christianview Bible College with a Bachelor of Theology. He came west to serve as Senior Pastor of the Faith Evangelical Covenant Church in Breton, Alberta, a position that he held from 1989 until 2000. In 1998 he was elected trustee for the Wild Rose school division. He served one term in this capacity, and did not seek re-election in 2001. Political career Abbott first sought election to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 2001 election, when he ran as a Progressive Conservative in Drayton Valley-Calmar. He won, taking approximately 68% of the vote. He was re-elected in the 2004 election with a reduced 59% majority. In the 2006 leadership election, he was the first MLA to back Ted Morton's leadership bid. In October 2007, Abbott was defeated by Drayton Valley mayor Diana McQueen in his bid to again secure the P.C. nomination for the 2008 election. He later publicly speculated about running for one of the province's other conservative parties, such as the Alberta Alliance, the Social Credit Party, or the Wildrose Party. He ultimately did not run, citing a fear of splitting the conservative vote with McQueen and expressing his support for Progressive Conservative leader Ed Stelmach, who he called a \\"great man\\". =Legislative initiatives= First term In 2001, Abbott introduced the Citizens' Initiative Act, a private member's bill that would have allowed any Albertan 18 years or older to sponsor a draft law by obtaining signatures from a number of eligible voters equal to 10% of the votes cast in the most recent provincial election, such signatories being required to include voters representing at least 10% of the votes cast in the election in at least two thirds of the province's ridings. If these signatures were collected in a six- month period, the proposed law would be put to province-wide referendum. If the referendum was passed by a vote of at least 60%, including 60% in at least two thirds of the province's ridings, it would be introduced in the legislature to be passed, amended, or defeated like any other bill. The bill never reached second reading in the Legislature. In 2002, Abbott introduced the government bill Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act, designed to stiffen penalties for employers violating occupational health and safety laws. It was unanimously adopted by the legislature. Also in 2002, he introduced the Fair Trading (Cost of Credit) Amendment Act, which would have required lenders under provincial jurisdiction to stipulate the annual percentage rate of the loan and which would have encouraged the government to establish consumer education programs about the cost of credit. It never reached second reading. In 2003, Abbott sponsored three bills. The government-sponsored Insurance Amendment Act would reduce payouts insurance payouts to some victims of automobile accidents. Abbott suggested that this would reduce Albertans' car insurance premiums, but opposition MLAs, including Liberals Kevin Taft and Laurie Blakeman and New Democrat Brian Mason suggested that it would only increase insurance companies' profits. The legislature adjourned while debate on second reading of the bill was still ongoing, and it was never brought to a vote. Abbott's second 2003 bill, the Livestock Industry Diversification Amendment Act (which was also government-sponsored), dealt with domestic cervids that escape into the wild, and passed the legislature. He also sponsored a private member's bill, the Insurance (Accident Insurance Benefits) Amendment Act, which would increase the cap on payouts for injuries resulting from automobile accidents. It was postponed for six months, effectively killing it. Abbott introduced two bills in 2004: the School Amendment Act, a government bill, expanded the responsibilities of teachers to include participation in curriculum development, assistance in developing provincial exams, and supervision of student teachers; the effect of this was to prevent teachers from withdrawing these services in work-to-rule situations. The bill also amended the process by which it was decided whether suspended teachers would be dismissed or permitted to return to the job. The bill passed the legislature. Abbott's second bill of 2004, the Insurance (Demerit Offences) Amendment Act, was a private member's bill that never reached second reading. It would have made it illegal for insurance companies to charge higher insurance premiums based on demerits assigned to drivers more than two years prior to an application for insurance. Second term Abbott's sole 2005 bill was the Animal Protection Amendment Act, a government bill which assigned an active duty to persons responsible for the care of an animal to provide it with sufficient \\"ventilation, space, food, water or veterinary care or reasonable protection from injurious heat or cold\\" (the existing act required only the provision of sufficient food, water, care, and shelter). It also provided whistleblower protection to reporters of animal abuse. It was supported by the Liberals and New Democrats, although Alberta Alliance leader Paul Hinman expressed concern that by providing a more exhaustive list of things which must be provided to animals, courts might be increasingly inclined to regard anything not explicitly listed as not being obligated. It passed the legislative assembly and was signed into law by Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Norman Kwong. In 2006 Abbott introduced the Parental Consent to Medical Treatment for Minors Act, which would require parental consent for minors under the age of 16 to access non-emergency medical treatment. Abbott and other proponents of the bill, including Progressive Conservatives Richard Marz, Victor Doerksen, David Rodney, and Cindy Ady, cited the example of plastic surgery (including breast augmentation, liposuction, and rhinoplasty) as examples of the treatments the bill was targeted at. Opponents, such as Liberals Bruce Miller, Weslyn Mather, and Harry Chase, New Democrat David Eggen, and Progressive Conservative Thomas Lukaszuk suggested that minors were unlikely to be able to afford such procedures without parental involvement anyway, and that the bill's true target was abortion. Alberta Alliance leader Hinman, meanwhile, cited abortion as a reason that he was in support of the bill. The bill was ultimately postponed for six months (with Abbott's support - in response to the comments of Progressive Conservative Lyle Oberg, a medical doctor, Abbott agreed that the breadth of medical treatments covered under the bill required further study), effectively killing it, since the legislature was not in session six months later. During the 2007 session, Abbott's last in the legislature (except for the 2008 session, which consisted only of a throne speech), he sponsored two successful government bills. The Farm Implement Amendment Act allowed financial institutions to lease farm equipment to farmers, a privilege previously reserved for implement dealers. The Mental Health Amendment Act, which he had planned to introduce as a private member's bill before it gained support from previous health minister Iris Evans, to reduce the requirement for involuntary institutionalization of the mentally ill from \\"in a condition presenting or likely to present a danger to self or others,\\" which courts had interpreted as requiring the presence of imminent danger, to \\"likely to cause harm to the person or others\\". The bill also allowed authorities to force patients to adhere to physician-mandated treatment plans even once they were no longer hospitalized. The bill passed after extensive debate, with Liberal Rick Miller announcing moments before the vote that he still didn't know which way he was going to vote. =Comments on Belinda Stronach= Abbott made national headlines in 2005 when, in response to federal Member of Parliament Belinda Stronach crossing the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals, he made comments to the media characterizing Stronach's actions as \\"whoring herself out for power\\". He was criticized for these comments by his Liberal colleague Rick Miller, who later alleged that Abbott confronted him physically in the corridor behind the legislative chamber following his speech. Abbott later apologized for his comments. Post-political life In an interview on the eve of his departure from the legislature, Abbott said that he saw himself returning to politics, either at the provincial or the federal level. However, he said that he wouldn't run against local member of the House of Commons of Canada Rob Merrifield until the latter was ready to retire, calling the prospect of challenging him in a nomination fight \\"unethical\\".

Life  Elias Demetracopoulos was born in Athens. As a 12-year-old in occupied Greece, he engaged in resistance efforts against the Nazis, for which he was imprisoned and tortured. His life was spared by moving him to a mental hospital for the last year of World War II. He survived and during the Greek Civil War was shot while trying to save relatives who‚Äôd been kidnapped by the Communists. He studied at Athens School of Economics and Business. From 1950 to 1958, he was political editor of I Kathimerini. In 1951 he became a correspondent for Macedonia and Thessaloniki. __Demetracopoulos was also political editor for Ethnos and co-founded the English-language Athens Daily Post. He was correspondent for the North American Newspaper Alliance and the New York Herald Tribune. After the Greek military dictatorship took power in 1967, he narrowly escaped to Washington, D.C., where he lived in exile and led the fight to restore democracy in his homeland, challenging both Democratic and Republican Administrations. In June 1970, the Greek dictatorship revoked his citizenship. In 1968, Demetracopoulos uncovered illegal campaign donations of $549,000 given by the Greek military dictatorship to the 1968 presidential campaign of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew. He gave the information to Larry O'Brien, then chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who did not expose the cash transfer but issued a call for an inquiry into the activities of Thomas Pappas. Through suits against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Demetracopoulos found out that he had been under extensive surveillance by those agencies from at least November 9, 1967, to October 2, 1969, August 25, 1971, to March 14, 1973 and February 19 to October 24, 1974. After 1975, he gained access to secret government files in Athens out of which he learned that there had been several attempts by the Greek junta to kidnap and kill him. In 1967, Demetracopoulos engaged attorney William A. Dobrovir to investigating the involvement of the United States. Dobrovir uncovered hundreds of documents from the FBI, CIA, Department of State, Department of Justice and Department of Defense, via the Freedom of Information Act. Some of the documents indicated that copies were sent to the National Security Council headed by Henry Kissinger at the time. It was not before March 1977 that the NSC agreed to release skeletal computer indices of these documents. In the computer indices, Demetracopoulos found a reference to a document referring to his death in a prison in Athens on 18 December 1970. For the next seven years, Dobrovir wrote letters to Kissinger asking for copies of the document. Kissinger eventually replied that he could not find such a copy.Christopher Hitchens: The Trial of Henry Kissinger p. 108-119 Demetracopoulos had personal friendships across the political spectrum, including Admiral Arleigh Burke, Louise Gore and Senators Ted Kennedy, Strom Thurmond, Frank E.

The play itself focuses on a group of inmates who go on a hunger strike in attempt to better their situation. There is also a soft love story, with the characters Eva, the new secretary at the prison, and Jim, a handsome inmate who works for the warden and is trying to get out on parole. Williams gained inspiration for the play after reading newspaper accounts of inmates who suffocated in a steam room in a Pennsylvania prison. Although the play was originally written in the 1930s, it was not discovered until the late 1990s when Vanessa Redgrave made it her personal mission to track it down. The play had its world premiere at the Alley Theatre in Houston in 1998. Plot summary = Act one = The play begins outside the warden's office with Eva Crane and Mrs. Bristol. Eva is there for a job interview as the new secretary for the Warden, while Mrs. Bristol is here to give her son Sailor Jack some baked goods she made just for him. Moments after the scene begins, Jim walks through towards the Warden's office and informs the women that the Warden is out inspecting the grounds, and may not be back for a while. Mrs. Bristol can't stay and leaves the food on the Warden's desk. Warden Whalen enters in an unannounced, brash way. He is a short, fat, yet powerful man with a presence. Eva begins to beg him for a job; however the Warden doesn't want to hear it, saying \\"A business executive is not interested in your personal misfortunes.\\" In the end, after careful consideration, he gives Eva the job. Meanwhile, Jim is being escorted back to his cell. Jim is a convict who helps out the Warden during the day. He enjoys the job because it gets him out of his cell all day. At nights when he returns, his cellmates are constantly calling him names such as Allison and Canary Bird. Some of the notable supporting characters introduced are Butch, the unofficial leader among the inmates; Queen, a gay convict who's not all that smart; and Ollie, a smart black convict who's well respected by all the inmates. The next morning Mrs. Bristol returns to see the Warden and this time she had brought more food for her son. She explains how she hasn't heard from her son in a while and is getting worried. The Warden explains, in a coarse manner, that her son had gone insane and had to be killed. The next day, Eva talks to Jim and asks him about the eating conditions at the prison. Jim says the food is terrible; however the Warden enters, and says that the food is fine. In an effort to put Jim back in line he tells the story to Eva about when Jim first got to the prison and how he had to whip him for 14 straight days to try to break through his rough exterior. This story is too much for Eva as she ends up fainting at the end of the scene. Down in the prison, the prisoners begin to get pains in their stomachs and have a hard time getting to sleep. Butch says that it's the poor food they are served everyday that is causing their pain, and suggests that they all go on a hunger strike. The men, all in pain, agree to the idea. Jim re-enters the prison and tells the men to hold off on the hunger-strike as he feels with his upcoming parole he can \\"tear down the walls of this prison\\". The men agree and say they will hold off for a little longer, and instead go to dinner and cause a small prison riot. By doing so, they have all earned time in \\"the hole.\\" Back upstairs, Eva is working with the Warden alone in his office. The Warden begins asking personal questions toward Eva and also starts being suggestive, even asking her to \\"come into the closet with him.\\" Before anything can happen, Jim walks in with a report about the prisoners in \\"the hole,\\" even bringing them up to see him. After talking to them all, the Warden decides they all need more time and he sends them back. Ollie, however, loses himself and doesn't want to go back; instead he rams his head into a wall and kills himself. Word reaches the prisoners and at this moment they can't take it anymore. They are fed up with everything that is going on at the prison and begin their hunger strike. = Act two = The Warden begins the act, talking with the Prisons Chaplain, who is concerned about how the Warden is treating his prisoners. The Warden portrays his, \\"my way or the highway\\" attitude toward the Chaplain. The Chaplain, not in agreement with the Warden's methods, decides to quit. Out in the waiting room, life in the prison is getting a bit restless, due in part of the hunger strike. Eva is answering phone calls left and right, while showing signs of stress during the process. Jim enters with a bloody arm. He tells her that he walked too close to one of the cages and one of the inmate's grabbed hold of him. Jim tells her she should leave this place, as it's not safe, but she refuses. Her true feelings for Jim begin to show as she wants to wait till his parole comes up and leave with him. They begin to move in for a kiss when the Warden enters and breaks it up. The new prison reverend enters the office and is instantly hired by the Warden, saying \\"I pride myself on being adjustable.\\" He goes on to say that he won't interfere with what the Warden does because he's not in charge, he's just the reverend. Afterwards, the Warden comes out and lets Jim and Eva know that if the hunger-strike continues, the men in Hall C will be moved to Klondike, a boiler room used as a torture room for out of line inmates, where the temperatures in the room can reach up to 150 degrees. Moments later, Jim and Eva are alone again in the Warden's office. Jim opens up to Eva about how he can't stand the prison, the inmates, the Warden, and the guards. Eva continues to remind him that once he gets parole in a month, the two will be able to run away together, but Jim is no longer optimistic about his parole. Eva reassures him that he will get out because she plans to go to the newspapers and tell them about all the terrible things that go on in the prison. At this moment, the Warden enters and tells Jim to take a file downstairs, thus leaving him alone with Eva once again. The Warden tells her that she can't leave since the building has been put on lockdown. This frightens Eva, getting her worked up, with the additional tension from the warden who takes advantage of the situation by seducing her. However, something comes up and the warden leaves. Just then, Jim enters. Eva tells him that she wants to leave the prison, no matter what it takes. Jim begins to devise a plan, to meet in the southwest corner of the prison yard when it's dark out, to attempt their escape together. = Act three = The act starts out in Klondike where the prisoners from Hall C are beginning to feel the heat from the steam boiler room. Butch is doing whatever he can to keep the morale up among his men by singing and dancing, but it's having no effect. Meanwhile, Jim and Eva have met in the southwest corner of the yard; however, the guards and the Warden have caught them and have begun to haul off Jim and put him in Klondike with the other prisoners. Warden also starts to blackmail Eva and ends up making a deal with her, that he will mail the letter of recommendation for Jim's release if she sleeps with him. Eva reluctantly agrees and episode three ends with the warden showing Eva to his \\"inner room\\". Back down in Klondike, Jim has joined the rest of the inmates; however, before Schultz, the head guard, can notice anything about Jim or the rest of the inmates, Butch has grabbed hold of the guard and Jim has stolen his revolver and keys. The inmates open the door and lock Schultz into the steaming cell, leaving him to die. Both Butch and Jim storm into the Warden's office; Butch looking for the Warden, and Jim looking for Eva. This leads to a confrontation with the warden who practically begs for his life in a cowardly manner, \\"Stop! I'm a family man! I've got a wife! A daughter! A little-girrrrl.\\" But, he is eventually killed by Butch with a whip. When they have a minute to talk, Eva and Jim discuss their future outside of the prison, and how they're in love and the many places they plan to travel to. Suddenly extra police forces arrive at the prison to deal with the prison riots. Jim comes up with a plan to jump out into the river and swim to shore away from all the riots and noise. He gives Eva his shoes and tells her to look for him in the personal columns. Jim jumps into the water, but because of the height of the jump and the fact that it is late at night, Eva is unsure if he made it safely in the water. The police arrive in the tower and grab Eva to take her to safety, bringing the play to an end. They question her about a pair of shoes she's got (which belongs to Jim), she replies \\"I picked them up somewhere. I can't remember\\", and continues to cling on to them. The audience remains unsure if Jim ever did make it out safely.

However, they rejected the play. It was finally produced by the Alley Theatre in 1998. The actress Vanessa Redgrave, who was preparing for a role in the 1989 revival of Orpheus Descending, another Williams classic, read an introduction by Williams which referred to the horrors of Not About Nightingales. Redgrave later said, \\"Basically, anybody could have found the play. I was the only person who was determined to find it.\\" She later contacted William's literary executor Maria St. Just, who was able to unearth the manuscript. Redgrave brought it to Trevor Nunn who agreed to direct the play. His production debuted in London on March 5, 1998, to very positive reviews. The world premiere in London of Not About Nightingales on March 5, 1998, was a collaboration of the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain and Corin and Vanessa Redgrave's Moving Theatre, in association with the Alley Theatre. The play moved to the Alley Theatre in Houston running from June 5 to July 3, 1998. Talkin' Broadway called it \\"A World Class Production\\" and \\"A glimpse in the writing of Williams that would transform him from Tom to Tennessee\\". The next year it opened at the Circle in the Square Theatre on February 25, 1999 and was nominated for six Tony awards, including best play and best performance by a leading actor, Vanessa's brother Corin Redgrave as the Warden.

Although it was a form of sports entertainment for much of its existence, a grassroots, early 21st century revival spearheaded by women has restored an emphasis on athleticism. Origins =Endurance races= The growing popularity of roller skating in the United States led to the formation of organized endurance races as early as 1884, when skater Victor W. Clough skated 100 miles over the course of nearly ten hours in Geneseo, Illinois. In 1885, a six-day \\"go-as-you-please\\" competition was staged at Madison Square Garden in New York City, with 36 skaters competing for $500$ in recent dollars. in prize money. Two deaths resulted from the six-day race: both the winner, William Donovan, and skater Joseph Cohen died shortly after the race was completed. Though the inquest that resulted from Cohen's death led to a recommendation for a law prohibiting roller skating activities exceeding four hours in length, a second six-day race was announced in May 1885. The popularity of roller skate racing, including endurance events, continued in the early 20th century. Races routinely featured amateur skaters as well as professionals, some of whom toured as troupes. Due to rowdiness at some events, including tripping and pushing, speed roller skating acquired a reputation for being something less than a legitimate sport. The International Skating Union of America, a competitor of the International Skating Union, formed in 1907 partly in response. This network of regional associations lasted 20 years, organized championship races, and established rules that prohibited rough play. Although tripping and pushing may not have been allowed at certain events, popular speed and endurance races continued to be held on both flat and banked tracks in the century's first three decades. Among these races was an 8.5-mile roller marathon organized in 1908 by a group of Chicago rink owners, a 24-hour endurance championship held in Milwaukee in 1913, and a 24-hour banked track race held at Madison Square Garden in 1914. The New York Times noted that the crowd at Madison Square Garden enjoyed the sudden sprints and spills during the event's preliminary races. The term derby, meaning a race or multi-race event, appeared in the press as early as 1922, when the Chicago Tribune announced and reported on the results of two \\"roller derby\\" events held that year. These were multi-day events during which various roller skating races were held on a flat track at Chicago's Broadway Armory. ‚ÄúRoland Cloni of Akron, world‚Äôs champion roller skater, who yesterday tried out the track in the Broadway armory, where the national roller skating derby will be held this week, asserted new world‚Äôs records can be established for flat tracks. The derby will open tomorrow and run until Saturday.‚Äù =Seltzer's walkathons= In 1929, as the Great Depression began, struggling film publicist Leo Seltzer (1903‚Äì1978) observed that cash prize-awarding dance marathons among out-of-work contestants and spectators were undermining attendance at his Oregon cinema chain, so he sought ways to capitalize on the trend. Seltzer began holding his own dance marathons, dubbed \\"walkathons\\" since contestants usually ended up just shuffling around for the duration of the contests, which could run as long as 40 days. Hundreds of unemployed people participated, hoping to win cash prizes. The contests were emceed by celebrities like Frankie Laine and Red Skelton, and grossed $6 millionAbout $ in recent dollars. in three years. Seltzer held his first commercial walkathon in 1931 in Denver, Colorado, then held 22 more, grossing $2 millionAbout $ in recent dollars. before retiring, citing that the events had become \\"vulgar.\\" In 1933, Seltzer moved his family to Chicago, Illinois and began booking events at the Chicago Coliseum. =Transcontinental Roller Derby= In 1935, the novelty of walkathons had worn off, but a roller skating fad arose again. According to folklore, Seltzer read an article in Literary Digest magazine that said ninety-three percent of Americans roller skated at least once in their lives. While discussing the article with regular patrons at Ricketts, a restaurant in Chicago's Near North Side, Seltzer was challenged to invent a sport incorporating roller skating. Jotting his ideas onto a tablecloth, he decided to combine then-popular six-day bicycle races and roller skating. Some sources give co-credit for the idea to Leo's brother Oscar. Roller derby has entertained the masses in one form or another since the 1930s, when brothers Leo and Oscar Seltzer conceptualized the idea of a skating contest on a Chicago restaurant tablecloth. It began as an idea jotted down on the tablecloth when brothers Leo and Oscar Seltzer were out to dinner. In August of that year, Seltzer organized his own Transcontinental Roller Derby, an event more than a month long. Staged at the Chicago Coliseum, it was a simulation of a cross-country roller skating race in which 25 two-person (male-female) teams circled a wooden, oval, banked track thousands of times, skating 11¬Ω hours a day, to cover 3,000 miles, the distance between Los AngelesThe National Museum of Roller Skating says San Diego, not Los Angeles. and New York City. Team standings were indicated by multicolored lights tracking their imaginary progress on a large map of the United States.SELTZER et al. v. SUNBROCK et al.; No. 1292. District Court, S.D. California, Central Division. 22 F. Supp. 621; 1938 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2240. March 8, 1938. Teams were disqualified if both members were off the track during skating times. Sixteen teams dropped out due to injuries or exhaustion, but nine teams finished, and the winning team, Clarice Martin and Bernie McKay, held the lead for the last 11 days of the event. Although Seltzer's spectacle had elements of originality, a U.S. District Court, ruling against Seltzer when he sued a competitor in 1938, found that the marathon roller race concept had long been in the public domain, so Seltzer couldn't claim copyright violation. Following the first event's success, Seltzer took the Transcontinental Roller Derby on the road, holding similar races throughout the U.S. with a portable track that reportedly cost $20,000.$ in recent dollars. Daily crowds averaged 10,000 in number, with spectators paying 10 to 25 cents admission.$ to $ in recent dollars. These races were billed as covering \\"4,000 miles\\" even though the simulated route was still about 3,000, covering the distance from San Diego to New York City. Contestants were the winners of elimination races in Seltzer's Transcontinental Roller Derby Association, which in September 1935 already had 3,000 members, paying $2 each,$ in recent dollars. at 1,600 rinks. By early 1936, Seltzer had selected a group of teams who competed in Chicago, Miami, Louisville, and Detroit. Skaters in these races only had to skate 8 hours nightly, but were encouraged to engage in \\"jams\\" and, at specific times, 5-minute sprints referred to in event programs as \\"open house\\". Later that year, Transcontinental Roller Derby debuted in New York at the New York Hippodrome, simulating a 21-day \\"short course\\" from Salt Lake City to New York. Appearances at the Pan Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, California attracted celebrities such as W.C. Fields, Mickey Rooney, Eddie Cantor, George Burns, Gracie Allen, Jack Benny, Milton Berle, Cary Grant and Eleanor Powell.The Pan Pacific Auditorium appearances may have been organized by competing promoters; more sources are needed. Occasionally, massive collisions and crashes occurred as skaters tried to lap those who were ahead of them. In 1936, 1937, or 1938 (sources vary), after seeing a match in Miami and realizing this was an exciting element of the sport, sportswriter Damon Runyon encouraged Seltzer to tweak the game to maximize physical contact between the skaters, including elbowing, \\"whipping\\", and slamming each other into the track's outer rail, as well as exaggerating hits and falls. Seltzer bristled, wanting to keep the sport legitimate, but agreed to the experiment, (link points to the archived article in the Spring 2000 edition of the author's own PopCult Magazine Web site) ‚ÄúThe faster skaters would break out and try and get laps so they would get ahead in the race, and some of the slower skaters started to band together to try and hold them back,‚Äù says Seltzer. ‚ÄúAnd at first, they didn‚Äôt want to let them do that‚Äìbut then the people liked it so much, they kind of allowed blocking. Then they came down to Miami‚ÄìI think it was 1936, early ‚Äô37‚Äìand Damon Runyon, a very famous sports writer, saw it and he sat down with my father and hammered out the rules, almost exactly as they are today.‚Äù which fans ended up loving. In the Depression's later years, some cities hosted the Derby's \\"short course\\" engagements, simulating semi- transcontinental distances. This page also mentions that crash helmets and a penalty box were new that year. Points were accumulated on behalf of three \\"factions\\", each named for a color (Black, White, or Green) and consisting of five two-person teams skating in 15-minute shifts. With all three factions on the track at the same time, two teams frequently banded together to rout the third. A more sporting variety followed, with just two teams being named after Indian tribes. This, too, was short-lived. The two-team concept survived, but teams were built around the idea of there always being a \\"home team\\" named for wherever the match was being played, even though the skaters were always the same people. By 1939, the organization had four pairs of teams touring the country at the same time, always billed as the home team versus either New York or Chicago. The format of two five-person teams on the track at the same time, with a team scoring points when its members lap members of the other team, is the basic premise of roller derby to this day. =Disaster= On March 24, 1937, 21 members of a touring group of Roller Derby skaters and support personnel were killed when their chartered bus blew a tire while going 40 mph down a hill on U.S. Route 50, collided with a bridge abutment, rolled onto its side and burst into flames, trapping passengers inside. The accident occurred near Salem, Illinois, as the bus was en route from St. Louis to Cincinnati for another performance. Only a few of the 23 passengers escaped the burning wreckage, and two of them died later from their injuries, bringing the total fatalities to 19 or 20 (sources vary).Deford 1971:133 The ghastly tragedy nearly put Seltzer out of business, but replacement skaters were signed and Roller Derby survived. As a tribute to those killed in the tragedy, the number \\"1\\" was permanently retired for all Roller Derby teams. =WWII era= In Los Angeles, Roller Derby was broadcast on the radio as early as 1939.; ; ; ; ; ; Transcontinental Roller Derby rapidly grew in popularity as a spectator sport. Matches were held in fifty cities in 1940, for more than five million spectators, some of whom formed fan clubs and newsletters like Roller Derby News (later renamed RolleRage). Teams began to represent and compete in other U.S. cities, although some teams were actually the same traveling group that would just change names depending on where they were playing, and all were part of the Seltzer-owned Roller Derby league. The league's own estimates of audiences for 1941 were comparable, with four million Midwestern spectators in 20 cities being claimed.Deford:1971:87. The entry of the United States into World War II at the end of 1941 interrupted the sport's ascent; many skaters enlisted in the armed forces, crowds dwindled, and the fledgling league was reduced to one team skating mainly for the entertainment of soldiers. After the war's end in 1945, Seltzer successfully resumed growing the sport, although a 1946 attempt to bring it to New York's Polo Grounds failed due to twelve straight days of rain.Deford:1971:88. =Television= At 8:30 P.M. on November 29, 1948, Roller Derby debuted on New York television, beginning a 13-week run on the CBS-TV network, broadcasting at a time well before television was in widespread use. The first televised matches were between teams representing New York and Brooklyn, and took place at the 69th Regiment ArmoryDeford:1971:89. four nights a week,Deford 1971:94. which was actually a reduction from the troupe's usual touring schedule that included a performance every day, sometimes with two on Sundays. Although few people owned TVs at that time, broadcasts could be seen on sets in bars and storefront windows. The fledgling medium allowed underwhelming audience sizes to be made to look like they had packed venues to capacity, leading spectators to turn out in droves for subsequent matches. Armory crowds began in the low hundreds, but were soon in the five to seven thousand range.Deford 1971:91‚Äì92. Then in June 1949, Seltzer secured an appearance at Madison Square Garden before a cumulative crowd of 55,000 over a five-day period.Deford 1971:95. Early stars of Roller Derby after its debut on TV included Carl 'Moose' Payne, Monta Jean Payne, Ken Monte, Bert Wall, and the temperamental Midge \\"Toughie\\" Brasuhn. Skater salaries were about $200 to $260 a week,$ to $ a week, in recent dollars. established by a players' association. Meanwhile, from 1946 through 1948, flat-track roller derby (of the skating marathon variety) was enjoyed as an intramural sport at the University of British Columbia in Canada.Photos of the 1946 roller skating marathon are in the 1946 The Totem, the UBC yearbook, page 69. For the 1949‚Äì1950 season, Seltzer opened franchise teams and formed the National Roller Derby League (NRDL). The NRDL consisted of six teams: the New York Chiefs, the Brooklyn Red Devils, the Jersey Jolters, the Philadelphia Panthers, the Washington-Baltimore Jets, and the Chicago Westerners. The Jolters played at Armories in Newark, Jersey City, Teaneck, and Paterson. The Westerners played in Chicago, but also in Columbus, Ohio and Miami, Florida. The Red Devils had no venue in Brooklyn, and were essentially a road team, often cast as villains. NRDL season playoffs sold out Madison Square Garden for a week. Also in 1949, when the CBS contract expired, broadcasting was taken over by ABC,Deford 1971:100. and games were televised live throughout the United States.Matches were televised thrice weekly in Los Angeles, for example: ; ; ; ; ; ; The contract with ABC lasted until Seltzer negotiated its termination in 1951 over scheduling disputes.Deford 1971:101. Between 1949 and 1951, Seltzer's organization grossed $2.5 million,Deford 1971:97.$ in recent dollars. bolstered by Madison Square Garden appearances in 1950 and 1951 that set five-day records of 77,000 and 82,000, respectively. In this period, Seltzer also sold the Jolters to an outside syndicate.Deford 1971:96. Skater salaries, negotiated by an informal players' union, were around $250 a week, with $35 and $60 bonuses for captains and player-coaches. =Increasing legitimacy= The players wanted to skate \\"phony\\" during this time period, but Seltzer believed the public would soon tire of exaggerated hits and falls, so he embarked on a campaign to legitimize the sport. He started a program encouraging the formation of junior Roller Derby leagues for children (although it's not clear whether any actually formed), he sought to add more teams nationwide (although it didn't happen until 1954), and he got the players to agree to a \\"no railing\\" rule. In a show of commitment, Seltzer invoked the rule to suspend star skater Midge \\"Toughie\\" Brasuhn, much to her chagrin, for allegedly shoving another skater into the track's outer railing, even though the play had been faked by the other skater. By the early 1950s, Roller Derby coaches were even betting on the outcomes of matches, another sign of legitimacy, according to Seltzer.Deford 1971:96‚Äì97. Players later pointed to injuries and low-scoring games as evidence of legitimacy, as well, but even into the 1970s, Roller Derby players engaged in a degree of showmanship and staged theatrics for dramatic and comic effect.Deford 1971:119,124‚Äì126 Jam On, Jam Off After terminating the contract with ABC in 1951, Seltzer negotiated a deal with General Motors to sponsor the broadcast of games on NBC. The deal fell through when, according to Seltzer, General Motors, fuming over an NCAA decision preventing them from sponsoring the broadcast of University of Notre Dame football games, lost interest in televising any sports at all.Deford 1971:101‚Äì103. A handful of independent TV stations continued to broadcast games, but the loss of network broadcasting caused fan interest to plummet.Deford 1971:105. Madison Square Garden no longer wanted to host matches, fan clubs disbanded, and Seltzer returned to pursuing real estate interests. At some point, Seltzer changed his residence to Encino (Los Angeles) a westward move that foreshadowed changes to come. Skaters leap over two who have fallen In July 1953, citing the effects of the Korean War and a dearth of venues, Leo Seltzer moved the Derby from New York to Los Angeles and created the L.A. Braves for their debut at the Rose Bowl. The Braves became the first international team when a tour of Europe was launched in 1953. However, this was not the first time audiences outside the U.S. had seen the game played live. A separate organization, International Roller Speedway, known in some countries as Roller-Catch, formed in 1937 and toured Europe, where they played at the Harringay Arena in London, and the Philippines. Roller Speedway was a modified version of the sport and normally featured two teams, representing Europe (the \\"home\\" team) and USA. The 1950 film The Fireball, starring Mickey Rooney, was based on the life of one of the league's stars, Eddie Poore, who skated under the name Eddie Cazar. Roller Speedway ceased operations in 1952. In 1954, the Derby established the most fabled team in the history of the sport, the longtime champion San Francisco Bay Bombers. Stars on this team eventually included Charlie O'Connell, Joanie Weston, and Ann Calvello. In his keynote address at the 2007 roller derby convention RollerCon, Leo's son Jerry Seltzer revealed that at its peak in the 1950s, the National Roller Derby League had just 83 skaters spread among its six teams. In 1958, weary of Roller Derby's off-air struggle ‚Äî by this time, crowds at San Francisco's Cow Palace had dwindled to two hundred or less ‚Äî Leo transferred Roller Derby to his son Jerry. Jerry soon struck a deal with independent Oakland TV station KTVU to broadcast Roller Derby matches kinescoped in a deserted garage. =In the 1960s= In 1960, KTVU switched to the visually and technically superior videotape format for recording games for broadcast.Deford 1971:106. One of Roller Derby's sponsors, a San Francisco auto dealer, got a Portland, Oregon TV station to broadcast an unedited tape of a match, in an attempt to advertise the dealership's new lot in the area.Deford 1971:105‚Äì107. To his surprise, Jerry Seltzer received three hundred letters asking for Roller Derby to come to Portland, so he obliged and the Derby made an appearance before 9,000 fans. Realizing he had stumbled onto a promotional formula, he began syndicating videotapes of games to more independent TV stations, and followed up broadcasts with personal appearances of the Derby in each city. In 1961, forty stations carried Derby. Several years later, UHF TV stations, mostly independent and desperate to compete with older, network-dominated VHF counterparts, snatched up broadcasting rights for their areas. Although TV exposure was an important component of Roller Derby's revitalization, Seltzer didn't want to repeat the experience of mainstream professional sports organizations that had become dependent on TV; he used the medium only for exposure and publicity for the live matches, not a source of revenue for player salaries.Deford 1971:109‚Äì110. Jerry Seltzer also changed some of the rules. For the first time, skaters were required to wear helmets, and, at the behest of KTVU television announcer Walt Harris, he made the game more TV-friendly by making jammers' helmets easier to spot. A more theatrical imitation called Roller Games was started in 1961 in Los Angeles featuring retired Roller Derby skaters who chose not to make the move to San Francisco. Owned by Bill Griffiths, Sr. and Jerry Hill, Roller Games was the only viable rival organization to the original Roller Derby and actually consisted of several separate leagues, including the (U.S.) National Roller Derby (NRD), soon renamed to National Roller League (NRL) since the \\"Roller Derby\\" trademark was aggressively protected by the Seltzer organization. The NRD/NRL consisted of the Northern Hawks (sometimes billed as the Chicago Hawks), New York Bombers, Texas Outlaws, Detroit Devils, Los Angeles Thunderbirds (nicknamed \\"T-Birds\\"), and Philadelphia Warriors (sometimes billed as the Eastern Warriors). There were also several attempts in markets that failed quickly, with teams such as the Baltimore/Washington-based Mid Atlantic War Cats, the Florida Jets, and the Western Renegades. Roller Games also encompassed the Canadian National Roller League (CNRL) and Japanese National Roller League (JNRL). Some former Roller Derby stars found new fame in the Roller Games, and a handful of skaters simply went back and forth between the two organizations. After 1968, however, the Roller Derby to Roller Games defections were quite few; instead, a handful of Roller Games skaters returned to their roots and began skating for the Derby again. 1961 or so also saw the advent of a short-lived New York City area rival league, the American Skating Derby (ASD), promoted by Joe Morehouse and Mike O'Hara. ASD debuted two teams of ex-Roller Derby skaters ‚Äî one team representing \\"New York\\" and the other representing Brooklyn ‚Äî at Long Island Arena in Commack, New York, around April 1961, with plans to appear throughout the Tri-State Region. A league split later that year resulted in the formation of another league, the Eastern Skating Derby (ESD), which lasted until mid-1964 and skated only in New York, sometimes at the same venues as the ASD.Yahoo! GroupsYahoo! Groups In 1962, Jerry, in partnership with his uncle Oscar Seltzer (who had founded the Roller Derby Skate Corporation in 1936), created the Dixie Devils, a \\"home\\" team for the Southern United States cities of Nashville, Atlanta, Jacksonville and Orlando.Deford 1971:107‚Äì108. Ronnie Robinson, son of boxer Sugar Ray Robinson, was designated the team's star player. Dixie Devils games had to be recorded with kinescope, when TV audiences had already grown accustomed to the relatively clean, clear appearance of videotape, and the result was disastrous; no loyal TV audiences were grown, fan attendance was low, and the venture folded after one month. Seltzer remained fond of the idea of regionalization, however, and envisioned his organization eventually becoming more like other sports leagues, with teams being independently owned and operated, and with the teams being associated with regions (South, Northeast, Mideast, Midwest, Central South, Southwest Plains, and West) rather than individual cities. The ASD, ESD, and Dixie Devils, much like Roller Speedway, aren't remembered today by anyone outside the most dedicated fans and the skaters who participated in them. To the media, there was only one Roller Derby. From Jerry Seltzer's takeover in the late 1950s, the game reached new heights of popularity with a 120-station television network where taped games from the Bombers' home, Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco, were shown weekly. Television made fans of thousands and the Bay Bombers packed arenas from coast to coast on cross country tours, regularly selling out arenas such as Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden, Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis and dozens more. In 1969, television viewership of Roller Derby peaked with approximately 15 million viewers each week.Rushin 1998. Two other developments in 1960s Roller Derby were profit sharing and annual contracts for skaters; many skaters previously held day jobs to supplement their income, or were only employed as athletes for part of the year.Deford 1971:165,174-175 =In the 1970s= The attendance record of 19,507 for a roller derby bout held at an indoor arena was set at Madison Square Garden in 1971. The all-time attendance record of 50,118 for any roller derby event was set on September 15, 1972 at an interleague match between the Los Angeles Thunderbirds of Roller Games (National Skating Derby) and the Midwest Pioneers of Roller Derby (International Roller Derby League) held at Comiskey Park in Chicago, an outdoor stadium. At this point, the Bay Bombers home-team concept was duplicated with the New York Chiefs representing the Eastern U.S. and the Pioneers based in Chicago (but really everything west of Pennsylvania). A one- season run in 1971 by the Cincinnati Jolter team in the Midwest (Ohio, Kentucky, and other areas) was not financially successful, and the team became a road franchise once again. The Bombers were briefly a Southwest team moved from the Bay Area, but potential new owners couldn't come to terms with the Seltzer family and so the Bay Bombers were returned home. (In an unusual move, the Chiefs were a \\"replacement\\" team for the Bombers during the period that franchise was supposedly based in Texas.) In 1973, high overhead and other factors led Jerry Seltzer to elect to shut down Roller Derby. In a 2005 interview, Ann Calvello mentioned gas shortages during the 1973 oil crisis as a contributing factor because teams could not travel. Some of the IRDL star skaters were recruited to skate for Roller Games' International Skating Conference (ISC), which quickly eliminated all Derby teams except for the Chiefs to again focus on the Los Angeles Thunderbirds.http://www.rollerderbypreservationassociation.com/modules.php?name=Leagues&op;=ShowLeagueAll&id;=179&id;_cat=32&categories;=ROLLERGAMES However, within two years, Roller Games' wrestling/circus-like approachDeford 1971:124‚Äì125 doomed that organization; many Roller Derby skaters quit and fans deserted the arenas. Cultural historian Paul Fussell, perhaps editorializing, attributed the collapse of the sport to the declining economic class of its fan base in its final years; fans were ultimately unable to support the sponsors that had been keeping the sport on television. 1970s‚Äì1990s revivals Several attempts were made to revive the sport in the late 1970s through the 1990s. =IRSL= The only reasonably successful of these was the International Roller Skating League (IRSL), operational from April 24, 1977 to December 12, 1987. IRSL games were held mostly in Northern California, but a handful of games were skated in the Northeastern United States, the Midwest, and Canada. Many skaters from Roller Derby were in the IRSL, and some of the team names were the same as in Roller Derby. Initially the league was composed of the San Francisco Bay Bombers, the Midwest Pioneers, the Brooklyn Red Devils and the Manhattan Chiefs. In 1979, one of the league owners, former San Francisco television producer Dave Lipschultz, bought and restructured it. He added two more teams, the Northeast Braves and Southern Jolters (later renamed the Southern Stars), and renamed the Chiefs as the New York Dynamite and, eventually, the Eastern Express. A final team, the Northern Knights, representing Canada, was announced in 1986 but never competed. As before, most of the attention was centered on the Bay Bombers. After skating primarily in Northern California, a Midwest tour was launched in 1984, but flopped due to competition from baseball and football as well as weather-related problems. In 1986, a tournament was carried on ESPN and the IRSL set up sporadic appearances in New York. ESPN dropped the contract in its pursuit of the more lucrative professional football market, and although talks were underway to broadcast IRSL matchups on USA Network, the IRSL was unable to survive without television support. Lipshultz shut down the league after its last game at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 1987. Around that time, Lipschultz and skaters were negotiating over how to keep it going. Lipschultz wanted to make it more like professional wrestling in an attempt to win over a fickle TV audience, but the players had different ideas. No agreement was reached, and potential sponsors lost interest. The 1985 IRSL matches have been shown twice on ESPN Classic's sports comedy show Cheap Seats, as ESPN retains the right to air those matches. American Skating Derby, promoting the game as Rollerjam!, formed in 1987 and played a spring season with two teams, the San Francisco Slammers and the Los Angeles Turbos. The name American Skating Derby was the same as the early 1960s New York-based league, but was unrelated. Composed of inactive Roller Derby and IRSL skaters, the 1987 ASD was formed primarily as a means to keep the game alive, and the two teams (with the Slammers being essentially replaced by the Bay City Bombers) skated around Northern California communities for high school charities. For the next decade, with sometimes as few as one game annually, the ASD attempted to keep the traditional game going.http://www.rollerderbypreservationassociation.com/modules.php?name=Leagues&op;=ShowLeagueAll&id;=85&id;_cat=22&categories;=ASD =RollerGames= right RollerGames, created in 1989 by two television producers, David Sams and Michael Miller, and Roller Games owner Bill Griffiths, Sr., was a U.S. television show that presented a theatrical version of the sport of roller derby for a national audience. It featured a steeply banked figure-eight track, an alligator pit, and a number of skaters who had been in the Roller Games league, as well as younger participants. The six teams were the T-Birds, Violators, Bad Attitude, Rockers, Hot Flash, and Maniacs. The show only lasted thirteen weeks despite garnering over a 5 national rating during its prime-time debut, and was in the top 25 of all syndicated shows for the season‚Äîeven beating the popular American Gladiators. Announcers were Chuck Underwood, David Sams, and Shelly Jamison. Halftime commentary was provided by Wally George. =RollerJam= right Between January 1999 and January 2001, 100 episodes, comprising four seasons, that aired between January 1999 and January 2001, plus a preview/pilot episode in December 1998 Knoxville, Tennessee television impresarios Ross K. Bagwell Sr. and Stephen Land, under the name Pageboy Entertainment, collaborated with CBS to stage another televised revival known as RollerJam or Roller Jam. Bagwell and Land recruited numerous stars from the Roller Derby of yesteryear, as well as newer stars from various athletic backgrounds, including nationally ranked speed skaters, to skate in the six-team World Skating League (WSL). Jerry Seltzer was named RollerJam \\"commissioner\\". RollerJam games were televised out of \\"RollerJam Arena,\\" on the grounds of Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. Initial teams, each consisting of seven men and seven women, were the New York Enforcers, the California Quakes, the Florida Sundogs, the Nevada Hot Dice, the Texas Rustlers and the Illinois Riot (Original names of the latter three teams were the Las Vegas High Rollers, Texas Twisters, and Illinois Inferno. These names were changed prior to the start of the first season). Despite strong funding and four seasons of broadcasts on The Nashville Network (TNN, now known as Spike TV), the venture never became a \\"live\\" attraction. After MTV's takeover of the CBS Cable group, fabricated storylines and uncharismatic characters were being featured more than actual competitive skating. This did not go over well with many skaters or die-hard roller derby fans. Two notable veterans from Roller Games, Rockin' Ray Robles and Patsy Delgado, were featured in the second season of RollerJam. When RollerJam was cancelled, many of the skaters found smaller leagues in which to skate. Forty episodes of Roller Jam have been reversioned for UK television after successful broadcasts in other countries. Airing from October 2, 2006, on Challenge TV much of the narrative has been removed with sex and violence toned down for a family audience. One major rule difference between previous leagues was the legalisation of in-line skates, which the WSL required for younger players in an attempt to push the league to younger players, more familiar with the in- line game, allowing for more precision skating over the traditional quads, allowing faster skaters to participate. Unfortunately, in-lines unlike quads, afforded little lateral mobility thus hampering the skaters ability to block effectively. Contemporary roller derby =All-female, grassroots leagues= A Blue Ridge Rollergirls skater offers help to novice fans. (Asheville, North Carolina). In 2000, Daniel Eduardo \\"Devil Dan\\" Policarpo, then an Austin, Texas musician, recruited women to skate in what he envisioned would be a raucous, rockabilly, circus-like roller derby spectacle. After an organizational meeting and a disputed fundraiser, Policarpo and the women parted ways. The women then self-organized as Bad Girl Good Woman Productions (BGGW) in 2001, creating a new generation of roller derby, open to women only. Founders formed four teams, and staged their first public match in Austin in mid-2002. Shortly after, the league split over business plans: The Texas Rollergirls embraced flat-track play, while the BGGW league took the name TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls and went on to skate banked-track roller derby. The revival then began in earnest, with over 50 similar all-female leagues in existence by late 2005, more than 80 by February 2006, and more than 135 by mid-August 2006. The sport's sudden growth in 2006 is attributed to its exposure via the Rollergirls reality television show, which depicted portions of the lives of real skaters from the TXRD Lonestar Rollergirls. The show began broadcasting in January 2006, but was not picked up for a second season due to unsatisfactory ratings. Leagues outside the U.S. began forming in 2006, and international competition soon followed. The first all-female Canadian league of 10 members, the Oil City Derby Girls, was formed in December 2005 in Edmonton, Alberta. Terminal City Rollergirls from Vancouver, British Columbia, appeared before an audience of 4500 on March 4, 2006 to participate in a game of \\"Last Woman Standing\\" (\\"Blood and Thunder\\") against the Rat City Rollergirls at the Everett Events Center in Everett, Washington. The first full, international bout in women's flat-track derby occurred in December 2006, when the Oil City Derby Girls hosted the Rocky Mountain Roller Girls (Denver, Colorado). By mid-2009, there were 425 amateur leagues, including 79 in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Germany, Belgium and Sweden combined. Although this revival of roller derby was initially all- female, some leagues later introduced all-male teams. Junior roller derby leagues associated with this revival also emerged and play under modified adult derby rules. =All-male roller derby= The Men's Roller Derby Association (MRDA) is the international governing body of men's flat track roller derby. It was founded in 2007 under the name Men's Derby Coalition (renamed to Men's Roller Derby Association in 2011), and currently has 64 men's leagues under its jurisdiction. MRDA member leagues play using the rules of Flat-Track Roller Derby originally designed by the WFTDA. =Mixed-gender, for-profit leagues= A handful of leagues, mostly mixed-gender, have origins in earlier incarnations of the sport and heavily promote themselves as professional due to their history, management, membership, style of play and marketing considerations. As of the mid-2000s, most of these leagues do not compete in regular seasons, but rather schedule infrequent special-event games, drawing from a relatively small pool of skaters to form the roster of two teams put together just for the event, or on one team that plays against a similar club from another league. Team names typically pay homage to memorable Roller Derby and Roller Games teams of the past. =Increasing use of real names= In 2009, some roller derby athletes began using their real names, rather than stage names, in competition. Examples include Team Legit, a pickup team of star skaters from Northwestern USA flat-track leagues playing in a banked track tournament in June 2009, skaters Sarah \\"Killbox\\" Hipel (from Detroit Derby Girls) and Julia \\"Lucy Furr\\" Rosenwinkel (from Windy City Rollers) now competing under their real names, and 13 members of the Denver Roller Dolls' travel team who began skating under their real names during their 2009 season.

It was one of the first twin-engined ultralights. More Lazairs have been registered in Canada than any other type of Canadian aircraft.Hunt, Adam & Ruth Merkis-Hunt: Skeletal Remains, pages 64-70. Kitplanes Magazine, September 2000. In 2019, Canada Post issued a stamp in honour of the Lazair. Development Dale Kramer visited the Oshkosh EAA convention in 1977, where he saw the potential of the ultralight aircraft present. He built and flew an early type of Superfloater ultralight sailplane. Kramer took it to the next year's Oshkosh, where he met Ed Sweeney. Later they fitted it with two of Sweeney's engine kits. Kramer kept the engines and designed a new plane for them, which would remedy the deficiencies he saw in the Superfloater.Dale Kramer; \\"Remembering Peter Corley: and the birth of the Lasair ultralight\\", free flight, Issue 2004/4 August/September, 2004, Page 4. He started with a blank sheet of paper and designed a completely new aircraft, the Lazair, even going so far as to design a custom airfoil for it. He named it Lazair for several reasons, including a reference to the successful Laser sailing dinghy of Canadian design, as a contraction of \\"lazy air\\" due to the slow cruising speed, and as an allusion to \\"laissez-faire\\".Hunt, Adam & Ruth Merkis-Hunt: Test Flying Lazair No. 1, pages 98-106. Kitplanes Magazine, December 2000. Performance was not as good as anticipated. Although Kramer did most of the test piloting, the lighter Corley took it on its first flight in November 1978. The engines were subsequently moved from their original position below the wing to directly in front of the leading edge. The improvement in performance proved definitive and in this form they demonstrated the prototype Lazair at the EAA Sun 'n Fun International Fly-In and Expo, Florida, in March 1979. It won the award for best home-built microlight, repeating the accolade at Oshkosh that year and receiving thirty- three orders on the spot. Kramer began series production, with Corley as his first demonstration pilot.John Partridge; \\"Success on the Wing\\", The Financial Post Magazine, August 1, 1982, pages 10-16. Design The Lazair I is a single-seat conventional high-wing monoplane with an open fuselage frame, inverted V-tail and twin tractor propellers. As an ultralight aircraft designed for low flying speeds, the fuselage comprises an open frame of aluminum tube supporting the open cockpit, tricycle undercarriage and inverted-V tail. The wing is mounted at the top of the fuselage frame with additional outboard diagonal bracing struts. It is of straight, constant taper, high aspect ratio planform. The airfoil section is of Kramer's own design and incorporates reverse camber at the trailing edge, giving an S-shaped camber line. The wing has a progressive and constant washout, or reduction in angle of incidence from root to tip. It also features some of the first modern winglets to be seen on a light aircraft. This combination produces an aircraft with optimized low-speed handling and very gentle stall characteristics. The high aspect ratio wing also made the Lazair a good glider, giving it a 12:1 glide ratio, and it could be soared in even light thermal conditions. The wing structure comprises an aluminum \\"D\\" cell leading edge, foam ribs and an aluminum tubular trailing edge.Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page E-21. Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. The wing and tail covering for the first 50 Lazair kits was an opaque urethane-impregnated nylon fabric. This was then changed to translucent Mylar PET polymer film, attached to the airframe with single- and two-sided tapes. The Mylar proved to have a short service life due to UV damage, so it was eventually replaced by the more expensive Tedlar PVF film. For control run simplicity the control stick pivot point was located above the pilot with the stick hanging downwards. Conventional ailerons together with tail ruddervators provided full three-axis control, which although standard on conventional aircraft was unusual for ultralights at the time. The ailerons on the wing and ruddervators on the tail were interconnected so that turns were made with connected rudder and aileron by moving the stick to the side. Pitch control was via conventional fore-and-aft stick movement moving the ruddervators together as elevators. Kramer opted for two engines instead of one because he wanted to use two of the largest chainsaw motors to obtain the total of 11 hp (8.2 kW) which he deemed necessary to make his \\"powered glider\\" fly with performance that was acceptable to him. He placed the two motors as close together as possible to reduce yaw when one failed. The Lazair was one of the first ultralights to incorporate twin engines, greatly improving the reliability and safety of this class of aircraft. The Lazair was thus built from standard aircraft materials, but it had many innovative design features for an ultralight, including the aerofoil, winglets, inverted-V tail and ruddervators, transparent film covered flying surfaces and twin engines. Later models incorporated many refinements and options including; twin seating in tandem, more powerful engines, fuselage fairings and a conventional control stick pivot position. Production The first Lazair prototype was constructed by Kramer with some help from Corley and first flown in 1978. In 1979, Kramer formed UltraFlight Incorporated to produce the design in his home town of Port Colborne, Ontario. In 1981, \\"UltraFlight Sales Ltd\\". was incorporated and sales of all aircraft kits were transferred to that subsidiary. Production ended in 1984, the company citing \\"liability concerns\\" and the resulting cost and availability of insurance as the reason. The aircraft were widely sold in Canada and the United States, making the Lazair the most numerous Canadian-designed aircraft type. The Series II Lazair was the model produced in the largest numbers. Operational history In the 21st century many Lazairs are still in use by private owners. As when first introduced, they remain prized for their handling qualities, if not their cruising speed. In November 2007 the Canadian register still carried a total of 460 Lazairs of all models. In the USA where the majority of Lazairs are flown as unregistered FAR Part 103 ultralights there were also ten registered as amateur-builts in November 2007. Variants and derivatives ;Series I The first Lazair kits were originally marketed just under the model name \\"Lazair\\", but were later termed \\"Series I\\" after improved models had appeared. It is interesting to note that from the first Lazair prototype, to the last Lazair kit produced, no changes were made to the aerodynamic design of the wing panels and tail surfaces. All the wing panels had the same airfoil sections, planform, washout, wing tip design, aileron design and incidence to fuselage (including the two place). All the tail surfaces had the same airfoil (flat), planform (minor difference with different tailwheels), washout (none), distance from the wing and incidence to the fuselage. The initial model Lazair was a single-seater with a wingspan and was powered by two 5.5 hp 100 cc Pioneer chainsaw engines, directly driving plastic propellers in tractor configuration. The main landing gear used wheels with a track of just 26 inches, which combined with the long wing span, meant that taxiing in more than of wind required a wing walker. Tail skids were fitted to the inverted V-tail.Hunt, Adam & Ruth Merkis-Hunt: Poised to Fly, pages 76-83. Kitplanes Magazine, October 2000. ;Series II There was customer demand for putting the Lazair on floats, but this required more power than the Pioneer powerplants could develop. The solution was to substitute Rotax 185 engines. These single- cylinder engines were used extensively in forest fire fighting water pumps and had proved reliable in that application. The propellers were the same plastic units used on the Series I with its engines. To absorb the greater power two propellers were stacked to form a \\"biplane propeller\\". This was done because UltraFlight had ample supplies of the existing propellers and using them saved money over developing a new propeller. Also, since inception, the Lazair was designed as a powered glider, so stacking of the two propellers in a bi-plane mode created a propeller that had less drag when gliding than if the 4 blades were 90 degrees apart. Any slight loss in thrust due to stacking was accepted since there was less drag when gliding. During the production of the Series II the tail skids were replaced with tail wheels and later on, swiveling wheels. Skis were also available, although open cockpit flying in the winter could be a challenge. Rudder pedals were introduced which allowed side slipping of the aircraft as well as crosswind landings. The rudders could be coupled to the ailerons or de-coupled and controlled by the pedals in flight through a mixer gear. ;Series III The third series of the single-seat Lazair introduced customer-requested upgrades, such as: *landing gear widened to *jury struts for increased negative-g tolerance *conventional floor-mounted control stick *toe brakes Power on the Series III is still provided by two Rotax 185 engines with the option of a pair of KFM or JPX PUL 425 engines. ;Elite The Lazair Elite is a limited production aircraft that includes a structurally strengthened airframe using the Lazair II wings and an optional an enclosed cockpit. It is suitable for heavier pilots. ;Lazair II The Lazair II is a two- seater trainer with the seats in side-by-side configuration. It was introduced in 1983 and approximately 50 Lazair II kits were sold. The Lazair II is powered by two JPX PUL 425 engines producing each. The engines are more widely spaced than on the single-seater models which gives it different single engine handling characteristics. ;Lazair SS EC The \\"SS\\" is the \\"Surveillance Special\\" which was designed for police use, which included the Elite airframe and the 5KFM engines also used on the two-seat Lazair II. The only Lazair SS EC aircraft ever produced was employed by the Monterey Park Police Department in California. and was used for surveillance during the 1984 Olympics that were held in Los Angeles . ELazair ;Electric Lazair (eLazair) In 2011 Lazair designer Dale Kramer introduced an experimental electric-powered Lazair on an amphibious mono-float, with outrigger floats at AirVenture. The aircraft is powered by twin Joby JM1 powerplants with Jeti SPIN Pro 300 controllers and dual 16 cell 4 amp-hour battery packs that produce 63 volts, mounted in the wings. The aircraft won Antique Ultralight Champion and Best Ultralight Amphibian at AirVenture. The aircraft is an experimental project and no production is planned.Sigler, Dean: Dale Kramer and his electric Lazair, Kitplanes, Volume 28, Number 12, December 2011, pages 31-35. Belvoir Publications. The Lazair inspired many other aircraft designers to use the Lazair wing construction techniques. The Blue Yonder Merlin is one aircraft that uses a wing based on the Lazair wing.Hunt, Adam: Merlin Magic, Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, COPA Flight, page C-1, February 2005Armstrong, Kenneth: Choosing Your Homebuilt - the one you will finish and fly! Second Edition, page 195-201. Butterfield Press, 1993. Regulatory status In Canada all Lazairs are classified as Basic Ultra-lights. A multi-engine rating is not required to fly the Lazair in Canada as there is no multi-engine rating for ultra-light aeroplanes. In the USA the single-seat models are flown as ultralights under FAR 103, whereas the Lazair II two-seat models are usually registered as experimental amateur-builts.

The office was established by the Oklahoma Constitution in 1907. The office was disestablished by the constitutional amendment State Question 50 to the Constitution. It was adopted at the special election held on July 22, 1975. The amendment came into effect on January 8, 1979. The duties of the Commissioner were taken over by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.  Qualifications and Term of Office  A Commissioner of Charities and Corrections had to have been a citizen of the United States, at least 25 years old, and have been resident of Oklahoma for at least ten years prior to election and served a four-year term that run concurrent with that of the Governor of Oklahoma.

ZAA has a progressive, science-based approach to animal welfare. Using the Five Domains Model, the Association grants accreditation to zoos and aquariums that have clearly demonstrated their commitment to positive welfare. This approach champions welfare from the animal‚Äôs perspective and it underpins all that ZAA-accredited zoos and aquariums do. ZAA and its members lead over 100 breeding programs in support of conservation and community education. Additionally, it actively contributes to threatened species recovery around the world. Together, ZAA members enhance the role of individual zoos and aquariums in conserving wildlife. Each year, they connect 22 million visitors with nature, educate 1.1 million students about wildlife, support 629 conservation programs and contribute over $20 million to conservation. As an association, ZAA brings its members together, facilitating shared knowledge and continuous improvement in conservation, welfare, biosecurity, science, research, social and community programs. The organisation is based in Sydney, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand.  Animal welfare  = The Five Domains = The Five Domains Model is a science-based structure for assessing animal welfare, which recognises that animals can experience feelings, ranging from negative to positive. It provides a best-practice framework to assess welfare in animals of all species and is used by all ZAA-accredited zoos and aquariums to assess animal welfare. The first four domains (Nutrition, Environment, Health and Behaviour) all help inform us about the animal‚Äôs various experiences, which make up the fifth domain, the Mental Domain. The Five Domains Model was developed by Professor David Mellor, founding Director of the Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre at Massey University. It is the animal welfare assessment model adopted by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) in their Animal Welfare Strategy. = ZAA Accreditation = ZAA-accredited zoos and aquariums exist for the purpose of conservation, education, science, research and connecting people with nature. The one thing that must underpin everything else they do is positive animal welfare. ZAA doesn‚Äôt believe in settling with just ‚Äúnot bad‚Äù, the organisations wants the animals under human care to experience ‚Äúgreat‚Äù welfare and live fulfilling lives. ZAA has a progressive, science- based approach to animal welfare. Using the Five Domains Model, the Association grants accreditation to zoos and aquariums that have clearly demonstrated their commitment to positive welfare. This approach champions welfare from the animal‚Äôs perspective and it underpins all that ZAA-accredited zoos and aquariums do. By law, the government requires zoos and aquariums to meet minimum standards to protect animals from bad welfare. The ZAA Accreditation Program goes further, using the Five Domains to focus on good welfare. It asks the question, is the animal having a fulfilling life of positive experiences? The Program assesses zoos and aquariums' commitment and achievements towards positive animal welfare. It requires them to think deeply about the welfare of the animals in their care and strive for continuous improvement. Zoos and aquariums must provide compelling evidence for set criteria on both their operations and the experiences of their animals. This is reviewed by ZAA, before one of the Association's expert Accreditation Officers visits the site in-person to validate the findings. Accreditation reports must be sent to the Standards and Accreditation Committee and approvals endorsed by the ZAA Board before accreditation is granted. The ZAA Animal Welfare Assessment Tool can be used to assess the welfare of any species and even allows for evidence of individual animals' preferences. Being evidence based, the program can incorporate new research and technology as society increases it's knowledge about the welfare of different species. ZAA- accredited zoos and aquariums operate to the highest levels. They must be assessed every three years to retain their accreditation status. International members are assessed yearly.  Wildlife conservation  = Zoo and aquarium conservation = ZAA-accredited zoos and aquariums in Australasia are huge contributors to conservation in our part of the world and globally. They participate in 629 conservation programs for threatened species worldwide. In 2017, they funded a total of $20.6 million to conservation as well as a further $3.1 million of in-kind support. Each year Australasian zoos and aquariums connect 22 million people with wildlife, fostering a love for our world's species and educating people about positive actions to help save them. ZAA leads member zoos and aquariums to work together for conservation and threatened species recovery. It helps members work strategically through its Wildlife Conservation Committee and provides an avenue for funding through the Wildlife Conservation Fund (WCF). The ZAA team are also actively involved in a range of government recovery programs in Australia, New Zealand and globally to save threatened species including orange-bellied parrot, southern cassowary, Tasmanian devil, kiwi and more. ZAA supports an approach that involves all the different experts working together to conserve a species ‚Äì the One Plan Approach developed by the Conservation Planning Specialist Group (CPSG). ZAA's role is to aid collaboration between members zoos and aquariums and other key conservation partners, as well as provide expertise and recommendations. = Species and breeding programs = ZAA leads the Australasian Species Management Program (ASMP), under which it coordinates over 100 breeding programs for a select group of species at ZAA-accredited sites across Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Managed programs play a role in protecting threatened species, conservation research and conservation education. This approach involves managing the animals at different ZAA-accredited zoos and aquariums as one big population and supports genetically diverse and sustainable species populations. Each ASMP species has a Species Coordinator, who uses specialised software to make recommendations about the breeding and management of that species. A team of experts on a particular group of animals (e.g. birds or reptiles) provide guidance to our Species Coordinators. This team is called a Taxon Advisory Group (TAG). The ASMP manages animal populations for protection against extinction, release to the wild, conservation research and community education. A list of managed species can be accessed on the ZAA website.  Animal health and biosecurity  Biosecurity is security against diseases and pests that could harm the native environment, economy or community. It is the precautions taken to lower the risk of spreading or introducing these pests or diseases. Good biosecurity is important to zoos and aquariums because it helps to keep wildlife, both in human care and in the wild, safe and healthy. It also helps to protect our people, domestic animals and ecosystems. ZAA works with its members, veterinarian professionals and the government to maintain and improve high standards of biosecurity. It does this by producing manuals and guidelines for good practice, conducting training, engaging with government, raising awareness, setting expectations for our members and educating the public. The National Zoo Biosecurity Manual (NZBM) was produced as a cooperative initiative between the Zoo and Aquarium Association, the Wildlife Health Australia, the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Australian Zoo sector. Guidelines (numbered sequentially for each section) outline the recommended practices to achieve best practice zoo biosecurity outcomes. The manual outlines both basic guidelines and higher level guidelines for all zoos. Governance and Operations The Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) is overseen by a Board elected by the members. ZAA's headquarters are located in Sydney, Australia and are hosted by the Taronga Zoo. The ZAA New Zealand Branch office is hosted by Wellington Zoo in New Zealand. Membership The Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) is a membership organisation that draws its strength from its members. As the peak body for zoos and aquariums in the Australasian region, ZAA has several categories of membership. The Australasian region includes: New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea and South Pacific Islands. Zoos and aquariums that wish to be regional or international members must achieve and maintain ZAA Accreditation for positive animal welfare.  Notes   References  * Laura M.

When the current market price is above the average price, the market price is expected to fall. In other words, deviations from the average price are expected to revert to the average. This knowledge serves as the cornerstone of multiple trading strategies. Stock reporting services commonly offer moving averages for periods such as 50 and 100 days. While reporting services provide the averages, identifying the high and low prices for the study period is still necessary. Mean reversion has the appearance of a more scientific method of choosing stock buy and sell points than charting, because precise numerical values are derived from historical data to identify the buy/sell values, rather than trying to interpret price movements using charts (charting, also known as technical analysis). Some asset classes, such as exchange rates, are observed to be mean reverting; however, this process may last for years and thus is not of value to a short-term investor. Mean reversion should demonstrate a form of symmetry since a stock may be above its historical average approximately as often as below. A historical mean reversion model will not fully incorporate the actual behavior of a security's price. For example, new information may become available that permanently affects the long-term valuation of an underlying stock. In the case of bankruptcy, it may cease to trade completely and never recover to its former historical average. In finance, the term \\"mean reversion\\" has a different meaning than \\"return or regression to the mean\\" in statistics. Jeremy Siegel uses the term \\"return to the mean\\" to describe a general principle, a financial time series in which \\"returns can be very unstable in the short run but very stable in the long run.\\" Quantitatively, it is the standard deviation of average annual returns that declines faster than the inverse of the holding period, implying that the process is not a random walk, but that periods of lower returns are then followed by compensating periods of higher returns, for example in seasonal businesses.[8] See also * Convergence trade * Cointegration * Regression toward the mean * Pairs trade * Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process * Trend following * Gambler's fallacy References External links *A Mean-Reversion Theory of Stock-Market Crashes *Reversion to the Mean, Taken to the Extreme Category:Market trends ","title":"Mean reversion (finance)"},{"id":"14013015","text":"Johann Georg, Chevalier de Saxe (21 August 1704 ‚Äì 25 February 1774), also called Johann Georg of Saxony, was a Saxon Field Marshal and Governor of Dresden. He was an illegitimate son of August the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, and Ursula Katharina of Altenbockum, divorced Princess Lubomirska, since August 1704 Imperial Princess (Reichsf√ºrstin) of Teschen. Life When he was legitimized, his father gave him the title of Chevalier de Saxe. Initially, Johann Georg chose a spiritual path and became a Knight of Malta, but later, like all of August's illegitimate sons, he joined the army, starting at the top (as a general). On July 27, 1763, he was appointed field- marshal Generalfeldmarschall. On 27 November 1764 Johann Georg acquired, for 14,000 thalers, the so-called Zinzendorfschen Garden, located outside Dresden's city gates. In the middle of the property, the building and landscape architect Friedrich August Krubsacius built magnificent palaces in a reserved form of the rococo style. These were (after the Moszinskapalais and the Br√ºhlschen Palais in Dresden-Friedrichstadt) the third \\"Maison de Plaisance\\" of the aristocracy outside the Dresden city walls. The interiors were not excessively large, emphasis being on the contemporary inclination towards elegance, intimacy and comfort. The palace annexes provided for functional spaces. The garden was also extended into some fields on the property, being reshaped significantly. According to the principles of the French baroque garden, it was severe in design. The palaces determined the centerline of the whole arrangement, with the salon overlooking all the garden's essential parts. On 30 January 1770 the Chevalier took leave of the army and moved to his garden property, without however renouncing his right to the large urban royal suite. Four years later, aged sixty-nine, after a prolonged illness, he died. In his will, the Chevalier declared his half- sister, Fredericka Alexandrine, Countess of Cosel (by marriage Countess Moszinska) his sole heir. For the separation of still more existing debts the obligation was imposed on her to offer the garden with the palace first to the Elector and then the prince Karl for 15,000 talers to the purchase. Only for the case of the refusal she should keep the garden, but against Erlegung of a capital of 10.000 talers for the separation of the debts. Immediately after the reading of the will, it was contested by the Commander of the Knights of Malta, the Oberhofmeister Baron of Forell. He informed the Elector that the Chevalier had been a member of the Order since 1728, and that consequently his estate belonged to the Knights of Malta. In 1776, the lawsuit brought by the Order was decided in its favour. As the deceased had badly underestimated his debts, amounting to c. 36,000 talers, the estate was liquidated, with creditors realizing 80% of the debts owed them and the Order receiving only 5,000 talers. Johann Georg was buried in the Roman Catholic Churchyard (Innerer Katholischen Friedhof) in Dresden.

His tertiary education was at the Northern Polytechnic Institute, Imperial College and the Royal College of Science, all in London. Anderson's most important research work was: * on the application of Raman spectroscopy to valence problems * accounting for the composition ranges of non-stoichiometric compounds by combining the ideas of Schottky and Wagner with those of Fowler and Lacher * his use of field-emission and field ion microscopy to study surface reactions at the atomic level *his use of the electron microscope to solve problems of reaction mechanisms in solid state chemistry * on the conditions of equilibrium of 'non-stoichiometric' chemical compounds. In addition he carried out practical investigations on the composition of minerals mined in Australia. He developed a love of the Australian bush and, with his family, a lifelong attachment to the country.

Thomas played college football at the University of Michigan from 1997 to 2000. He broke Michigan's career rushing record with a four-year total of 4,472 yards. As a senior, he rushed for 1,733 yards and was selected as a first-team running back on the 2000 All-Big Ten Conference football team. Thomas was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft and played for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). As a rookie with the Bears in 2001, Thomas rushed for over 1,100 yards and seven touchdowns to earn NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. He played for the Bears from 2001 to 2004, Dallas Cowboys in 2005, New Orleans Saints in 2005, and Buffalo Bills from 2006 to 2007. High school career Thomas was born in Pineville, Louisiana, in 1977 and attended Winnfield Senior High School in Winnfield, Louisiana. He starred on the basketball, track, and football teams. He totaled 7,594 rushing yards and scored 682 points for the Winnfield tigers. He also set a state record with 106 career touchdowns while playing both running back and placekicker. He was named a first-team All-American and rated as the second-best running back in the country by the Prep Football Report. College career Thomas enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1997. While playing at Michigan, he was given the nickname \\"A-Train\\" by Brent Musburger. As a freshman, he was a member of the undefeated, national champion 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team. That year, he was the Wolverines' #2 running back (behind Chris Howard), twice rushed for over 100 yards (122 yards against Baylor and 129 yards against Iowa), and compiled a total of 549 rushing yards and 219 receiving yards. He was honored as the 1997 Big Ten Freshman Of the Year by both the conference coaches and media. After his freshman year, Thomas led the Wolverines in rushing for three consecutive years with 893 yards in 1998, 1,297 yards in 1999, and 1,733 yards in 2000. His 1,733 rushing yards in 2000 remains the second highest single-season total in Michigan history. During the 2000 season, Thomas had nine games in which he rushed for over 100 yards, including 228 yards against Illinois, 199 yards against Northwestern, and 182 yards against both UCLA and Auburn. He was selected as a second-team All-Big Ten player in 1999 (coaches and media), and as a first-team All-Big Ten player in 2000 (coaches and media). He was also selected as both a team captain and most valuable player on the 2000 Michigan team. Thomas's 4,472 rushing yards broke Jamie Morris' Michigan career rushing records. (Thomas's record was later broken by Mike Hart.) He also broke Tyrone Wheatley's modern Michigan career record with 56 touchdowns (55 rushing and one receiving). He also set and continues to hold Michigan records with an average of 144.4 rushing yards per game in 2000 and six games in a season with at least 150 rushing yards. Professional career In April 2001, Thomas was selected by the Chicago Bears in the second round (38th overall pick) of the 2001 NFL Draft. On October 21, 2001, Thomas set two Bears rookie records with 188 rushing yards and a 8.55 yards/carry average in a 24‚Äì0 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. He set his third franchise rookie record in the season finale with 33 carries; he also had 160 yards a touchdown in the clinching victory over Jacksonville. With 1,183 rushing yards during the 2001 season, Thomas helped lead the Bears to a 13‚Äì3 record and an NFC Central championship. In January 2002, he received the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year for the 2001 season. Thomas remained the Bears' top running back for two more years with 721 rushing yards in 2002 and 1,024 rushing yards in 2003. In 2004, Thomas Jones took over as the Bears' lead back, and Thomas was limited to 404 yards on 122 carries. In May 2005, Thomas signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys and was expected to be the backup running back to Julius Jones. He appeared in six games, two as a starter, for the 2005 Cowboys, gaining only 80 yards on 36 carries. Thomas' ineffectiveness in limited duty, his inability to play special teams, and the emergence of Marion Barber III as the primary backup led Dallas to release him in November 2005. He was quickly signed by New Orleans after they lost Deuce McAllister with a season ending knee injury. Thomas appeared in only four games, all as a backup for the Saints, and gained 12 yards on seven carries. On April 28, 2006, Thomas signed with the Buffalo Bills. In 2006, he appeared in 16 games, two as a starter, for the Bills, and gained 378 yards on 107 carries. The following year, he appeared in 10 games and gained 89 yards on 36 carries. He was placed on injured reserve in early December 2007. Coaching career In 2011, Thomas served as the running backs coach at West Virginia Wesleyan College. He was promoted to special teams coordinator and assistant head coach in 2012. In 2015, Thomas was selected for induction into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.

He retired from the service in 1974, but continued to serve in an unofficial capacity on training programs until his death in 1988.United Kingdom Royal Navy Museum, Captain Launders' Service Record, Public Records In addition to his reputation amongst his crew, colleagues, and historians as a brilliant, highly skilled, and courageous officer, Launders is remembered as the only submarine commander in history to have engaged and sunk an enemy submarine (U-864) using only his own unaided vessel () while both boats were fully submerged.U864: Hitler's Deadly Last Secret, Discovery Communications, 2006 Early Royal Navy career In 1925, when he was five years old his parents took him to the British colony known as the Uganda Protectorate. He spent his childhood \\"exploring\\" what is today Mount Elgon National Park and took many extended trips with his father into the far western part of the country in what would later become Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Launders returned to England in late 1935 at the age of 16 and joined the Royal Navy as a cadet on 1 January 1938. Upon completion of his training, he was posted as a midshipman to the battlecruiser on 1 January 1939. He was serving aboard Repulse when the war broke out. Second World War service =Assignment to Venturer and reputation= Though he would continue to serve aboard Repulse for more than two years, it was to be his last assignment to a surface vessel for some time. On 1 April 1941 (after the war had been raging for about a year and a half and the Battle of the Atlantic was well underway), Launders was posted to his first submarine assignment aboard . In recognition of his outstanding service during that critical phase of the Battle of the Atlantic, Launders was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) on 22 December 1942. He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1943. His career was on a \\"fast track\\", and on 18 May 1943, he received his first command, one that would make him famous: Venturer. Venturer was Launders' first submarine posting, but his intellect, quick thinking, and leadership had put him in position for just such a challenging command. Venturer was a fast-attack \\"hunter-killer\\" sub, whose mission was to hunt for enemy shipping and other submarines, attack them, and to effect a speedy getaway without engaging in a prolonged action. Launders was a \\"rising star\\" in the Royal Navy submarine command at the time. a \\"boy- wonder with a genius for mathematics,\\" which gave him a tremendous edge in making the necessary vector calculations (manual or minimally mechanical- computer assisted reckoning of speed and trajectories for targets, torpedoes, attacking vessels and currents) that were part of submarine warfare tactics of the day. The Royal Navy staff's opinion of Launders' capabilities was apparently shared by his crew. Regarding his time aboard Venturer with Launders, former Royal Navy Sub Lieutenant John Frederick Watson (a retired geologist who served with Launders during the war aboard Venturer and was decorated \\"Awarded for Great Keenness and Devotion to Duty\\" for his actions during that time) stated: > It was very much a Band of Brothers. Only 37 in the crew and Launders was > way ahead in terms of his experience, his knowledge, his abilities; it was > obvious to the rest of us. Nobody thought to question what he decided to do. Former Able Seaman and retired Royal Navy instructor Henry James Plummer also served aboard Venturer during the war with both Launders and Watson. Himself decorated (\\"Awarded for Courage, Cheerfulness, and Alertness\\"), Watson said of Launders: > We trusted him. We knew he was a good commander. We‚Äôd have gone to the end > of the Earth with him‚Ä¶because he was that good. King George VI also praised Launders, declaring him \\"...a fearless and skillful commander.\\" Launders was awarded a bar to his DSC on 18 July 1944 for \\"outstanding courage, resolution and skill.\\" =Action aboard Venturer= Venturer had sunk some thirteen German vessels during ten patrols over the previous twelve months, including the Type VIIC U-boat U-771 off Norway's Lofoten Islands on 11 November 1944,Listing of British Submarines of WW2 some east of Andenes, Norway, resulting in Launders' appointment as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) \\"for courage, skill and undaunted devotion to duty\\". However Venturer's most notable feat was the sinking of U-864 on 9 February 1945, off Bergen, Norway while both vessels were submerged. Sinking of the U-864 Launders was the commander of Venturer when, on 9 February 1945, in the North Sea west of Bergen, Norway, his submarine torpedoed and sank U-864, commanded by Korvettenkapit√§n Ralf-Reimar Wolfram. U-864 was a Type IX U-boat, designed for long, ocean-going voyages with limited re-supply. It was on a highly sensitive, long-range, covert mission, codenamed Operation Caesar, to deliver highly sensitive technology to their wartime ally, the Empire of Japan. U-864's top-secret manifest included jet-engine parts from the German Me 262 jet fighter plane that the Japanese were going to try to clone, missile guidance systems from Peenem√ºnde, of the type used on the V-2 rocket, and many tonnes of mercury, a raw material that was in short supply in Japan that was vital to the industrial production of ordnance since it was a necessary component in the fabrication of detonators. U-864 had put into the U-boat pens in Bergen to repair damage from having run aground during their first attempt to set off on the mission (they had to take very round-about routes that were often not well charted to avoid Allied anti- submarine warfare patrols in the main shipping channels). During the boat's layover there several days earlier, the pens were hit by an Allied bombing raid, but U-864 itself escaped serious damage. With her damage repaired, U-864 once again was underway for Japan. However, their normally quiet engine started to make an abnormally loud, rhythmic noise that could be easily detected by any anti-submarine warfare equipment in the area. Wofram decided to return to Bergen to repair the problem. Neither he nor anyone in the Nazi high command knew that the Enigma code, Germany's top-secret naval encryption system, had been broken by British mathematician Alan Turing and his cryptanalytics team at Bletchley Park. All naval communications to and from the U-boat fleet were being read by the Allies, and they knew of Operation Caesar. Wishing to deny the Japanese any advantage that might extend the war in the Pacific, Royal Navy Submarine Command dispatched Venturer to intercept and destroy U-864. Launders received a brief message from Royal Navy Submarine Command as to the estimated whereabouts of U-864 (with reasonable precision, somewhere near the island of Fedje, off Norway's southwest coast, just north of the pens at Bergen), along with instructions to destroy her. Launders set about the task, making one risky but calculated decision: he decided to switch off Venturers ASDIC (a then-advanced form of sonar), which would severely limit their ability to detect other submarines, but would greatly reduce the chance of being detected themselves. They would rely purely on Venturer's hydrophone (a common, long-used, and far less sophisticated underwater acoustic detection device) to try to detect U-864. It was a huge gamble. U-864 had already left the area recommended to Launders. Unfortunately for the U-boat, U-864's commander had decided once again to return to Bergen to repair an engine noise problem. The decision would bring U-864 right back past Fedje, where HMS Venturer was lurking. Venturers hydrophone operator noticed a strange sound which he could not identify. He at first thought that it sounded as though some local fisherman had started up a boat's diesel engine. Launders decided to track the strange noise. Then, due to poor adherence to proper periscope usage protocol on the part of the German crew, the officer of the watch on Venturers periscope noticed another periscope poking up above the surface of the water. Combined with the hydrophone reports of the strange noise, which he determined to be coming from a submerged vessel, Launders surmised that they had found U-864. Launders tracked U-864 by hydrophone (in itself a difficult feat), hoping it would surface and allow a clear shot. However, U-864 detected the presence of the British submarine and remained submerged and started to zig-zag. This made U-864 quite safe according to the assumptions of the time. After several hours, it became clear that the U-boat was not going to surface, but Launders decided to attack anyway. It was theoretically possible to compute a firing solution in three dimensions, but this had never been attempted in practice because it was assumed that making the complex calculations would be impossible. Nevertheless, Launders and his crew did just that, making assumptions about U-864s defensive manoeuvers. Launders ordered the firing of all torpedoes in the four bow tubes (as a small, fast-attack boat, Venturer was equipped with only four in the bow, none in the stern, and carried only eight torpedoes), with a 17.5 second delay between each shot, and at variable depths. U-864 made a crash dive, straight into the path of the 4th torpedo. The result was catastrophic damage to U-864s hull, causing the German boat to instantaneously implode, with the loss of all hands. U-864 sank from Bergen. Aftermath of the U-864 engagement For their actions, several crewmen aboard Venturer were decorated by the Royal Navy, and Launders himself was awarded a bar to his DSO \\"for gallantry, judgment and skill in a successful patrol.\\" Launders became the first, and to date only, submarine commander to be publicly acknowledged as having sunk another submarine in combat while both vessels were submerged. After the war After victory in Europe on 8 May 1945, Launders did not muster out of the Royal Navy, but continued to serve, receiving promotions to lieutenant commander in 1949 and commander in 1957. In the post-war years, he was posted to a number of different vessels and shore stations, held a number of staff posts, and was posted to NATO. He was a full 4 ring Captain of HMS Forth, looking to the 7th submarine squadron at Singapore 1968 to 1970. Launders retired from the Royal Navy in 1974. Jimmy Launders died in 1988 of natural causes at the age of 69.

D. Robb (the author, writing under two of her pseudonyms). The second half of the book is part of the In Death series, taking place between Imitation in Death and Divided in Death. The plot follows a diamond robbery, over a span of 56 years. Hot Rocks (Part 1) Laine Tavish runs an antique shop called Remember When, and spends her time trying to forget her father Jack O'Hara. O'Hara is a career thief, and although Laine loves her father, she wants nothing to do with him. Unfortunately, when her father's best friend is killed in front of Remember When, Laine cannot help but get involved. Her father's friend was not the only one who has tracked her down, and before he died, he tells Laine, \\"Hide the Pooch\\". A private investigator, Max Gannon, catches up with Laine and reveals that Jack, his best friend Willie Young, a man named Alex Crew, and an inside man stole 28 million dollars' worth of diamonds, and divided them into four shares. But Alex Crew has decided he wanted all of the diamonds, and has already killed two of them, and taken one of the other shares. Two are still out there, and Crew will kill Laine, Max, and Jack, to get his hands on them. Big Jack (Part 2) Samantha Gannon is the granddaughter of Laine and Max, and the great-granddaughter of Jack O'Hara. Samantha has written a book on the diamond robbery, in which she reveals that 1/4 of the diamonds were never recovered, and $7 million are still hidden somewhere. One evening, Samantha returns home to find her roommate, Andrea Jacobs, dead, slashed across the throat. Lt. Eve Dallas is brought into the investigation, and soon it becomes apparent that the murders are connected to the diamond robbery. With the help of her billionaire husband Roarke, and new detective partner Peabody, Eve is on the trail of the last relative of Alex Crew. Trevor Whitter is his grandson, and obsessed with the missing diamonds. Convinced Samantha knows where they are, he will do any thing to get her. Once he finds the diamonds, he will kill her too.

Early life Aichhorn's father had had a career in the banking system of Austria, but it ended with the long depression which began in 1873. Career Aichhorn was initially an elementary school teacher in Vienna, and in 1918, following World War I was responsible for setting up educational centers for problem youth in Lower Austria. His success in this endeavor led him to be encouraged by Anna Freud (1895‚Äì1982) to enroll in psychoanalytic training at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute in 1922. Soon afterwards, Aichhorn set up a child guidance service for the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Prior to and during World War II he was a training analyst for psychiatrists in Vienna, and following the war Aichhorn and his former student Otto Fleischmann took legal maneuvers to reopen the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, which was later renamed the ‚ÄúAugust Aichhorn Gesellschaft‚Äù.Georg Mohr, ‚ÄúAugust Aichhorn. Friend of the Wayward Youth‚Äù, In: Alexander, F., Eisenstein, S., Grotjahn, M. (ed.): Psychoanalytic Pioneers, New York, 1966, p. 348‚Äì359. The city of Vienna was a lifelong source of strength and vitality for Aichhorn. Heinz Kohut said of him:Heinz Kohut: ‚ÄúAugust Aichhorn‚ÄîRemarks After His Death.‚Äù In: Paul H. Ornstein (ed.): The Search for the Self, Vol. I (1978), pp. 131‚Äì133. ‚ÄúHe knew every shade of dialect, every nuance of local habits, depending on regional and class differences. He knew it all without effort because it was his medium of life.‚Äù August Aichhorn is considered to be one of the founders of psychoanalytic education. He is remembered for his work with juvenile delinquent and disadvantaged youth. He believed that imposed discipline and suppression which were practiced in traditional reformatories yielded few positive results. Aichhorn was known for his intuitive talents in dealing with the antisocial nature of troubled adolescents, and his unorthodox approach in handling their aggressive tendencies. Aichhorn was an advocate of the idea that there was a distinction between manifest and latent delinquency, and believed that arrested development in youth was a precursor to antisocial behavior. He also believed that this situation was caused by disturbances in early child-parent relationships. Aichhorn was known for his ability to improvise with patients and thus overcome impasses. Heinz Kohut once said the following of Aichhorn: Aichhorn was the first analyst of young Heinz Kohut in 1938‚Äì39, before Kohut went into exile first in England and then in the United States. Of other later prominent American psychoanalysts, Aichhorn also analyzed Kurt R. Eissler. Aichhorn's best known written work was his 1925 Verwahrloste Jugend (‚ÄòWayward Youth‚Äô), which is still regarded as a relevant resource. This was in fact the only book he wrote, but his students have edited collections of his writings. The ‚ÄúAugust Aichhorn Center for Adolescent Residential Care‚Äù in New York is named after him.

A site was put aside in Sunbury following the implementation of the Neglected and Criminal Children's Act of 1864. Destitute or orphaned children were sent as wards of the state to learn a trade in the belief that this may then provide them with the skills necessary (once they were old enough), to provide and care for themselves. The school was co-educational although girls and boys were segregated. Boys were expected to learn a trade while girls were expected to handle menial tasks such as washing clothes, cleaning floors and to assist with cooking. The school consisted of ten large, unheated, bluestone buildings arranged in two rows of five. Located on the side of Jackson's Hill, they were called the Hill Wards. The open and exposed position of the buildings led to frequent illness and constant poor health of the children. The children were given rancid food, that they ate in their own rooms that by the time they received it, was cold. The children were given only a little water, no bedding, save for a blanket and many affected by Ophthalmia, went untreated, resulting in blindness. It was estimated that around 10 percent of children died within the first year of operation. This fact alone led to the school gaining the nickname of the Sunbury Slaughterhouse. Eventually, after public outcry, and after numerous Royal Commissions into the Industrial School System, by 1879 the Sunbury Industrial School was closed. The site was used as an asylum for the mentally ill from 1894 until around 1912, the patients were referred to as inmates. By 1914 at its peak, the Sunbury Lunatic Asylum housed 1000 patients. The asylum was renamed a psychiatric hospital and then a mental hospital. By the 1920s the Health Reformation Act came in and improved conditions. By 1968 until 1992, the site was called the Caloola Training Centre for the Intellectually Disabled. Presently, the site is used by Victoria University.

It extends from Central Otago, along the eastern side of the Alpine Fault to Cook Strait. There are also isolated outcrops of the Haast Schist within the central North Island. The schists were named after Haast Pass on the West Coast. The Haast Schist can be divided geographically from north to south into the Kaimanawa, Terawhiti, Marlborough, Alpine, Otago and Chatham schist.  Description  The metamorphic grade progresses from greenschist, biotite, garnet and finally orthoclase. Myrmekitic textures occur within oligoclase within the garnet zone. The schist's protoliths were the greywacke and argillite of the Caples Terrane and Torlesse Composite Terrane. The schists were originally brought to the surface of the Earth's crust in the Cretaceous and again during the Kaikoura Orogeny along the Alpine Fault.

They were a small number of individuals loosely organized into a cult that was devoted to the practice of contrary behavior. The Contraries are related, in part, to the clown organizations of the Plains Indians, as well as to Plains military societies that contained reverse warriors. The Lakota word heyoka, which translates as clown or opposites, serves as a collective title for these institutionalized forms of contrary behavior of the Plains Indians. When Lakota Indians first saw European clowns, they identified them with their own term for clowns, heyoka.  History of concept  George B. Grinnell introduced the designation Contraries based on his visits to the Cheyenne around 1898. Written accounts of the heyoka (i.e., the Contraries and clowns of the Lakota and Santee) were published even earlier. The cultural anthropologist Julian Steward described various forms of contrary behavior in 1930. In 1945, Verne Ray examined contrary behavior in the ritual dances and ceremonies of North American Indians and differentiated a further characteristic of the contrary complex of the Plains Indians, reverse reaction, which means to do the opposite of what one is asked.  Social role  The social role of the Plains Indian clowns was ceremonial since they performed primarily during rituals, dances and feasts. Unlike the clowns, the special role of the Contraries was not restricted to brief performances, rituals or the warpath. It was their everyday life. The Contraries of the Plains Indians were unique and historically unprecedented. John Plant examined the ethnological phenomena of contrary behavior, particularly in the tribes of the North American Plains Indians. The Contraries of the Plains Indians were individuals committed to an extraordinary life-style in which they did the opposite of what others normally do. They thus turned all social conventions into their opposites. Contrary behavior means deliberately doing the opposite of what others routinely or conventionally do. It was usually accompanied by inverse speech, in which one says the opposite of what one actually means. For example, \\"no!\\" expresses \\"yes!\\" And \\"hello\\" means \\"goodbye\\". To say \\"Grandfather, go away!\\" would be an invitation for him to come.  Reverse warriors  In addition to the Contraries and the ceremonial clowns, many Plains tribes recognized certain persons having the role of \\"reverse\\" warriors. These were usually experienced warriors who in battle purposely abided by contrary, foolish or crazy principles. Generally, they belonged to military organizations that also took part in dance ceremonies. Only the \\"reverse\\" warriors used inverse speech, and only they did the opposite of what they were commanded or instructed to do (reverse reaction). The \\"reverse\\" warrior charged into battle when ordered to retreat and could only fall back when he was commanded to attack.

It encompasses much of the historic village and parish of Goldington that was merged with Bedford in 1934, although some parts of the old village are within the neighbouring Newnham ward. It also includes two modern estates that are part of Renhold Parish. The boundaries of Goldington are approximately The Spires and Aspire estates to the north, Norse Road to the east, Goldington Road to the south, with Church Lane and Bow Hill to the west. The northern part of the area is sometimes known as Elms Farm. History Goldington was a village which grew up along the old A428 road between Bedford and Cambridge. St Mary's Church in Goldington has parish registers going back to 1559. In August 1645 Major Walter Baskerville, a Royalist cavalry Officer, was killed in a skirmish in Goldington. Goldington Hall (a small mansion) was built in the 1650s. The Hall was rebuilt in 1874. In 1934 the southern part of the parish of Goldington was merged with the expanding Bedford town, with the northern rural parts becoming part of Ravensden or Renhold. The area was greatly expanded to the north in the 1960s and 70s, seeing the return of some of the original parish lost in 1934. This expansion included the development of the Elms Farm estate and the Church Lane shopping parade. The Poppyfields estate was developed in the area in the 1990s. In the 21st century The Spires and Aspire housing estates have been constructed on the northern boundary of Goldington. These newer estates are in the civil parish of Renhold.

He is best known for being part of an attempted escape from Alcatraz Penitentiary in 1938, and for attacking Al Capone in the prison's laundry room on June 23, 1936. Biography Lucas was originally sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment for robbing First National Bank in Albany, Texas, and violation of the Dyer Act (interstate trafficking of stolen vehicles). He arrived at Alcatraz in January 1935 from the Texas State Prison and was known there as James \\"Texas Bank Robber\\" Lucas. =Attack on Capone= On June 23, 1936, Lucas stabbed Al Capone in the back with a pair of scissors from the prison barber shop. Capone had been working in the laundry area away. Lucas was sent to solitary confinement for his attack on Capone. After being stabbed, Capone turned and grabbed Lucas and threw him into the wall. The inmates were angry with Capone for not taking part in an inmate strike. Alcatraz escape attempt In the spring of 1938, James Lucas, Thomas R. Limerick and Rufus Franklin planned an escape from Alcatraz. Their escape plan began by incapacitating an unarmed guard supervising a work detail on the top floor. Once the supervisor was rendered unconscious, the convicts would escape through a window to the rooftop, where they would incapacitate an armed guard and leave the island via a seized police boat. They enacted their escape plan on May 23, 1938 in the prison's mat shop, where they assaulted Custodial Officer Royal Cline with hammer blows to his head. They proceeded to the roof, where armed guard Harold Stites (who was later killed in the 1946 Battle of Alcatraz) shot both Franklin and Limerick, although Lucas wasn't shot. Other guards arrived at the scene. Franklin, Limerick, and Lucas were cornered and surrendered to the guards. Cline died of his injuries the next day, and Thomas Limerick, the other wounded convict, also died. Lucas and the other surviving convict, Rufus Franklin, were tried for murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Lucas spent six years in isolation for the incident. He was transferred a few years later, and paroled in 1958. Lucas had a brief stay in prison at McNeil Island for parole violation. He was given a presidential commutation of sentence and released. He later worked in the oil business. He died in 1998 in Sacramento.

He was one of the militant activists behind The Lucas Plan,The Lucas Plan by Hilary Wainwright Schocken Books (1981) a radical strategy to avoid workforce layoffs by converting production at Lucas from armaments to civilian products.https://www.techworld.com/tech-innovation/plan-when-engineers- proposed-socially-useful-goods-over-weapons-3685280/  The Plan: when engineers proposed socially useful goods over weapons The plan's aim was to replace weapons manufacture with the development of socially useful goods, like solar heating equipment, artificial kidneys, and systems for intermodal transportation. The goal was to not simply retain jobs, but to design the work so that the workers would be motivated by the social value of their activities. As Cooley put it \\"the workers are the experts‚Äù.https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/hilary-wainwright/new-economics-of- labour  The new economics of Labour by John McDonnell and Hilary Wainwright 25 February 2018 The proposals of the alternative plan were not accepted by Lucas management and Cooley was dismissed in 1981, allegedly for spending excessive time upon union business and \\"concerns of society as a whole\\".

Publications =Architect or Bee: 1980= In 1980, Cooley published Architect or Bee? a critique of the automation and computerisation of engineering work. The book alludes to a comparison made by Karl Marx on the creative achievements of human imagination.cf Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I According to Orlando Hill, \\"Mike Cooley‚Äôs Architect or Bee? put the case that a new organisation of technology could provide social good rather than profit\\". He goes on to say: \\"Cooley argues that if we are going to move from merrily producing commodities to producing goods that people need and want, we must change our attitude towards technology. The technology used today evolved from the concept of the division of labour. In a capitalist system in which the maximization of profit is the sole objective and people are regarded as units of labour-power, the division of labour and fragmentation of skills is absolutely rational and scientific. However, the consequence is the deskilling of workers and alienation from reality. A division between theory and practice is created with a bias towards theoretical knowledge. The skill and practical knowledge of the worker is despised.\\" Cooley's work on human-centered systems and socially useful production was compiled and first published by Shirley Cooley, Mike's wife, in 1980 (Hand & Brain publications); the second edition was published in the US in 1982 by South End Press with an introduction from MIT Professor David Noble and was followed by a new edition published by Hogarth Press in 1987 with an introduction by Anthony Barnett.

On-screen participants included Andr√© Gorz, Patrick Minford, Claus Offe and Mike Cooley, and the discussion was chaired by Robert Hutchison. According to the film, technology would \\"virtually eliminate the manual working class by the end of the century\\" and displace jobs permanently. Gorz proposes working towards a future in which free time is sustained by a guaranteed minimum income and that production should be confined to essential goods and that people should pursue satisfying and autonomous activities. Mike also features prominently in German filmmaker Harun Farocki's film Wie Man Sieht (As You See, 1983), which examines the emergence of computerization and its effects on military and managerial uses of innovative technology. Mike's work was the subject of the TV documentary ‚ÄúLook, No Hands!‚Äù in 1988 made for the Equinox Channel Four documentary series. Directed by Christopher Rawlence and produced by Debra Hauer. The film was shown as part of season 1988, Episode 12, on Oct 9, 1988 and also produced as a VHS video. In 1997, Cooley appeared in \\"My Education\\" by John Quinn, an RTE radio serieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ_qIhrWw3s and book published by Town House. The book is a set of interviews with educationalists discussing their own education and features Mike Cooley, Noam Chomsky, Seamus Heaney and Charles Handy among others. Cooley and Quinn also collaborated on ‚ÄúEducation for the 1990s‚Äù: Three Lectures Given at a Symposium in Radio Telef√≠s √âireann, October 1989 (RT√â 1989). Cooley appeared in the 2003 Alan Gilsenan documentary \\"Sing on Forever\\" about the Irish playwright Tom Murphy (playwright), recalling his friendship with Murphy in Tuam. Awards  Mike Cooley was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1981 for \\"designing and promoting the theory and practice of human-centred, socially useful production\\". In his acceptance speech, Cooley said, \\"Science and technology is not given. It was made by people like us. If it's not doing for us what we want, we have a right and a responsibility to change it.\\" Mike Cooley (centre) accepting the Right Livelihood Award with co-recipients Patrick van Rensburg (left) and Bill Mollison (Right) in 1981.

The area's borders are approximately Bromham Road and Beverley Crescent to the north, the Midland Main Line railway line to the east, and the River Great Ouse to the south. Queens Park is a diverse and multicultural area, reflected in the many specialist shops and businesses located in the community, including many international supermarkets and delis. There are also a varied number of places of worship, including an Anglican church, two mosques and the largest Sikh temple in the United Kingdom outside London.  History  The Allens Tower (demolished 2009), the space occupied by this office tower is now designated to be a medical centre. The land in Queens Park was farmed as early as the 11th century, and occupied by tenant farmers. The only evidence of primitive settlements is the discovery of flint at Honey Hills. Early settlements and dwellings included; Provendor Farm, Prebend Farm, and the Farm House & cottages at Bedford Ford End (until the 1950s) now Fernleigh Close. Gallows existed up to 1802 at the sharp bend on the Bromham Road.NJ Greenaway, Some notes on the history of Queens Park, 1980 In 1890 W.H.Allen from London brought twenty acres of land west of Bedford town centre to establish his 'Queens Engineering Works', and housing for his employees. The works (opened in 1894) and the new community were named in honour of the queen of the day, Queen Victoria. Queens Park has hosted many communities migrating to the Bedford area over the 20th century, firstly Irish and Italian families, followed by Asians, Africans, and most recently, people from Eastern Europe. The engineering works survived in Queens Park for over 100 years, but over that time a great number of other businesses and shops have established themselves in the area. Today, Queens Park is one of the most established and centrally located areas in Bedford. Bedford Town Football Club played in the area between 1913 - 1981, and again briefly upon re-formation in the early 1990s. Governance Queens Park is an unparished area, with all community services under the direct control of Bedford Borough Council. Queens Park elects two councillors to Bedford Borough Council, both councillors are currently from the Labour Party. Economy Eagle Brewery There are a great many shops serving the Queens Park population, which are a mix of mostly independent retailers, with a few chain stores. Ford End Road acts as the \\"high street\\" for the area, and includes independent supermarkets, deli's, takeaway restaurants, and a Tesco Express store. There are more shops and businesses located on Iddesleigh Road, including convenience stores and Queens Park's post office. One of the largest businesses in the area is the 'Eagle Brewery' (operated by Marston's Brewery).https://eaglebrewery.co.uk/ Eagle Brewery The brewery is now the largest employer in Queens Park after the closure of the Allen's Engineering Works in 2000. Education There are three primary schools in Queens Park - Queens Park Academy which is situated over two sites on Chestnut Avenue and Marlborough Road,http://www.queensparkacademy.co.uk/ Queens Park Academy Westfield School on Chester Road,http://www.westfieldschool.net/ Westfield School and St Joseph's and St Gregory's Roman Catholic Primary School which is also on Chester Road. For older children the area is in the catchment for Biddenham International School which is located just to the north of Queens Park. Enterprise House (located on Old Ford End Road) is a small adult education centre operated by Bedford College. The centre offers a range of part-time courses for the Queens Park community, covering a range of subjects from child care and computing to English language skills and maths.Enterprise House with Bedford College Jamia Masjid Gulshani Baghdad Mosque in Queens Park Religious sites * All Saints Church (Church of England), located on Iddesleigh Road * Bedford Moravian Church, located on Howard Avenue * Serbian Orthodox Church services are also held at Bedford Moravian Church * The Jamia Masjid Gulshani Baghdad Mosque, located on Westbourne Road Queens Park & Bedford Mosques * The Jamia Masjid Hanfia Ghousia Mosque located on Ford End Road * The Guru Nanak Gurdwara (Sikh Temple), also on Ford End Road Community facilities Allen Park Recreation Ground The area is on a main bus route into Bedford town centre.

Services  Linden is served by Kapiti Line commuter trains operated by Transdev Wellington under the Metlink brand operating between Wellington and Porirua or Waikanae. Services are operated by electric multiple units of the FT/FP class (Matangi). Two diesel-hauled carriage trains, the Capital Connection and the Northern Explorer, pass through the station but do not stop. Off-peak trains stop at all stations between Wellington and Waikanae. During peak periods, trains from Wellington that stop at all stations may terminate at Porirua or Plimmerton and return to Wellington while a number of peak services run express between Wellington and Porirua and thus do not stop at Linden.metlink, Paraparaumu Line timetable , accessed 30 October 2007. Travel times by train are seventeen minutes to Wellington, four minutes to Porirua, and forty-three minutes to Waikanae. Trains run every twenty minutes during daytime off-peak hours, more frequently during peak periods, and less frequently at night. Before July 2018, off-peak passenger train services between Wellington and Waikanae stopping at Linden ran every thirty minutesmetlink Kapity Train Line timetable effective from 20 January 2016 but were increased to one every twenty minutes from 15 July 2018.  History  The line through Linden was originally part of the Wellington - Manawatu Line built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR). The single track line opened on 24 September 1885 when services commenced on the first section of the line from Wellington to Paremata with the full line to Longburn completed in 1886. Trains were operated by the WMR until December 1908, when the New Zealand Railways Department purchased the WMR and incorporated its line into the NIMT. On 19 June 1937, the Tawa Flat deviation to the south of Linden was opened to passenger services with double track from Tawa Flat to Wellington. It eliminated the circuitous single track route via Johnsonville to Wellington. The line through Linden was electrified in June 1940 and double track from Tawa Flat to Porirua was completed on 15 December 1957.John Yonge (editor), New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 16. Linden station opened with trains stopping there from 28 July 1940, after more than thirty years of requests to the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) by developers, and by local residents wishing to avoid a walk of up to a mile from the Tawa Station. Apparently, those wishing to alight used to pull the emergency brake cord so that the train stopped in the vicinity of Collins Avenue; Don Carman recalls passengers debating as to whose turn it was to pull the cord.Murray (2014), p. 154Murray & Parsons (2008), p. 33 Deputations and letters to the minister in the 1930s were told that the time (for a station) was not yet ripe; though a petition in April 1939 got agreement after completion of electrification (in 1940), though delayed by the war. Originally conditional on not asking for a shelter, the Railways department was approached by Arthur Carman to agree to residents erecting a shelter. The department relented and erected a simple 6-metre by 3-metre wooden shelter, opened on 30 April 1941. In 1954, a diversion of the meandering Porirua stream north of Linden station cut off a loop of the stream and eliminated two old wooden road bridges by taking the stream under a new bridge built at the intersection of Collins Avenue, Linden Avenue, Beachamp street, and Findlay Street. This allowed the Linden shopping centre to be developed on Collins Avenue on both the east and west sides of the railway. In conjunction with the double tracking of the line from Tawa Flat to Porirua in 1957, an island platform was constructed at Linden and a new larger shelter built from precast concrete panels replaced the original shelter. The original straight track through Linden became the northbound line and a new southbound line was constructed that curves around the station. Pedestrian access between the north and southbound tracks was provided from Collins Avenue at the north end and a steel and concrete overbridge with ramps was constructed at the south end to provide access to Rawson and Hinau Streets. A feature of the overbridge was the high wooden sides to shelter pedestrians from the strong winds which are prevalent above Linden Station. With the double tracking, barrier arms were installed for vehicular traffic on Collins Avenue and pedestrian cribs or zig-zags provided. However, because northbound trains stopping at Linden lead to prolonged operation of the flashing lights, bells, and barrier arms, and a second train approaching can also keep the warning alarms operating for long periods, many pedestrians became habitual risk takers. The cribs were also poorly designed forcing some pedestrians to walk with their backs to the trains before stepping onto the railway line. A series of pedestrian deaths at Collins Avenue followed. This led to the installation of second train coming indicators and, in the late 1980s, to longer pedestrian cribs that ensured pedestrians always faced oncoming trains and took sufficient steps to look up and see approaching trains before stepping onto the railway line. In the late 1970s, the original incandescent platform lights that automatically lit when stopping trains approached were replaced with more efficient permanently lit mercury vapour lights. From April to June 2014, the corroded steel overhead footbridge was refurbished and new lighting and signage provided.Murray (2014), p. 228 However, the original high sides on the bridge were not restored but replaced with lower sides leaving pedestrians exposed to the strong winds and driving rain. In early January 2019, the pedestrian overbridge was closed after structural engineers found it was below the required seismic rating and was earthquake prone. Possible future options are under consideration. As many commuters live south of the station and most of the parking is at the south end of the station, commuters must now walk some 400 metres extra distance from their cars to the single remaining station entrance at Collins Avenue and back to the station to catch a train. Tawa College students who commute from other stations must also walk the extra distance. The resulting extra pedestrian traffic including the extra use of the Collins Avenue level crossing by students has increased the risk of another serious accident at this high-risk level crossing. Initially, electric passenger services stopping at Linden were trains hauled by ED and EW class electric locomotives, and DM/D and EM/ET class electric multiple units. ED locomotives hauled passenger trains from their introduction in 1940 but were rarely seen on passenger trains after the introduction of the EW class locomotives in 1952. The last ED operated in 1981. EW class locomotives introduced in 1952 pulled the majority of passenger trains from 1952 but became redundant with the introduction of EM/ET class multiple units in the early 1980s. The last EW hauled passenger service through Linden was on 11 February 1983. DM/D electric multiple units first ran on the line on 5 September 1949,Murray & Parsons (2008), p. 36 and the last of this class were withdrawn from service after the arrival of the FT/FP class (Matangi) multiple units in 2011. The EM/ET class multiple units were introduced between 1982 and 1983 to replace locomotive-hauled trains and some of the DM/D electric multiple units and last operated on 27 May 2016 after additional FT/FP class (Matangi) multiple units were introduced (instead of upgrading the EM/ET units).

Prehistory and history  The wetlands are a minute remnant of the former Glacial Lake Tonawanda that dominated this region 11,000 years ago. Hopkins Road was originally constructed as a corduroy road in the early 19th century due to the boggy nature of the soil.  Protected areas  Much of the swamp is protected and accessible to the public. Portions of the southern and eastern boundary of the conservation area are privately owned and permission should be sought prior to visiting these areas. =Billy Wilson Park= Billy Wilson Park, a park owned and operated by the Town of Amherst, is adjacent to the western portion of the swamp. A portion of the park was formerly a small municipal dump for the Town of Amherst from the 1920s to the 1960s; it was remediated and repurposed as parkland in 1989. Billy Wilson Park provides boardwalks and trails for viewing nature within Amherst, which is a well-developed suburb of Buffalo. Conservation of the wetlands is also intended to help control flooding. The entrance to Billy Wilson Park is located on Hopkins Road north of the intersection with Klein Road in Amherst.

The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well. Gameplay The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler), and yellow (The Charger). The player begins competing against The Growler, but if the computer's truck runs out of money it will forfeit the race and be replaced with The Charger. Should The Charger run out of money it will be replaced with a second green vehicle and so on. It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game. In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red. The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible. The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb, and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race. To advance to the next event the player must complete a \\"cross country\\" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.

Sanskrit dvƒÅra means \\"gate\\" or \\"door\\", and pƒÅla means \\"guard\\" or \\"protector\\". The related name in Indonesian and Malaysia is dwarapala. Equivalent door guardians in northern Asian languages are Kong≈çrikishi or Ni≈ç in Japanese, Heng Ha Er Jiang in Chinese, and Narayeongeumgang in Korean. Origin and forms Dvarapalas as an architectural feature have their origin in tutelary deities, like Yaksha and warrior figures, such as Acala, of the local popular religion.Helena A. van Bemmel, DvƒÅrapƒÅlas in Indonesia: temple guardians and acculturation By Helena A. van Bemmel, Today some dvarapalas are even figures of policemen or soldiers standing guard. These statues were traditionally placed outside Buddhist or Hindu temples, as well as other structures like royal palaces, to protect the holy places inside. A dvarapala is usually portrayed as an armed fearsome guardian looking like a demon, but at the gates of Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka, dvarapalas often display average human features. In other instances a fierce-looking nƒÅga snake figure may perform the same function. The sculptures in Java and Bali, usually carved from andesite, portray dvarapalas as fearsome giants with a rather bulky physique in semi kneeling position and holding a club. The largest dvarapala stone statue in Java, a dvarapala of the Singhasari period, is 3.7 meters tall. The traditional dvarapalas of Cambodia and Thailand, on the other hand, are leaner and portrayed in a standing position holding the club downward in the center. The ancient sculpture of dvarapala in Thailand is made of a high-fired stoneware clay covered with a pale, almost milky celadon glaze. Ceramic sculptures of this type were produced in Thailand, during the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya periods, between the 14th and 16th centuries, at several kiln complexes located in northern Thailand. Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, Gainesville, Florida Depending on the size and wealth of the temple, the guardians could be placed singly, in pairs or in larger groups. Smaller structures may have had only one dvarapala. Often there was a pair placed on either side of the threshold to the shrine. Some larger sites may have had four (lokapƒÅlas, guardians of the four cardinal directions), eight, or 12. In some cases only the fierce face or head of the guardian is represented, a figure very common in the kratons in Java.

Critics charge that the vagueness in these definitions would permit the government to classify many types of venerated American political activity, such as civil disobedience, as terrorism. Critics frequently cite Section 899A, which reads, in part: \\"The use, planned use, or threatened use, of force ...to coerce the ..government, (or) civilian population ..in furtherance of political or social objectives\\",HR 1955 section 899A(accessed December 8, 2007) as particularly problematic.

The workshops were opened in 1928, and were closed in 1992 as part of a rationalisation of workshop facilities throughout the country. Otahuhu Workshops were built following a report that highlighted the inadequacies of the Newmarket Workshops, the central Auckland facility that the Otahuhu Workshops replaced. Originally it was proposed that Otahuhu would carry out locomotive work and Wellington's Hutt Workshops would be the Car and Wagon Workshop. This was reversed when it was found that the land on which Otahuhu was to be built was not suitable for the heavy machinery required for locomotive work. Though officially a Car and Wagon Shop, Otahuhu did some repair and maintenance work on steam and diesel locomotives and railcars. Some of Wellington's fleet of D class electric multiple unit carriages were overhauled there. Other work included light maintenance on steam locomotives, with particularly busy periods being 1929‚Äì1930 when 37 locomotives received overhauls and boiler repairs, and 1947‚Äì1949 when Otahuhu was called on for the urgent conversion of 19 K and Ka class locomotives to oil burning. Some other years in which locomotive work was carried out were 1931, 1933, 1942, 1945 and 1946.  History  The New Zealand Railways Department called for tenders for \\"new Car and Wagon Shops at Otahuhu near Auckland\\" on 30 September 1926 following the Fay-Raven report of 1925. By 1928, the new facility was completed, and some men from the Newmarket Workshops were tasked with installing new equipment at the site. The workshops officially opened for business following the Christmas holiday period of 1928‚Äì1929, at which time the Newmarket Workshops closed. Though the buildings for the new facility were all on the same site, there was a Midway that separated two groups of buildings. On the western side of the yard were the Wagon Shops, Machine Shop, Blacksmiths Shop, Reclaim, Powerhouse and Stores. To the east were the Structural Shop, Trimming Shop, Car Shops No. 1 and 2, and the Woodmill. Increasing demands for rolling stock and new requirements necessitated the extension or modification of the Structural Shop and the Machine Shop, and the installation of an Electroplating Shop and Battery Shop in the Trimming Shop. Other buildings included an administration block, schoolroom and canteen. The workshops played their part in the war effort. Prior to New Zealand's involvement in World War II there was a building known as the Air Force building. It was intended to be used to train apprentices in aircraft maintenance, but the Royal New Zealand Air Force occupied the building for the duration of the war. The war saw many workshop staff seconded to places such as the Devonport Naval Base and local engineering firms that were contracted to the military for the production of war supplies and equipment. Work undertaken during the war included the production of slat beds for the Army, small-arms ammunition machines for the Colonial Ammunition Company, dual flying yokes for Air Force craft, and tugboat hulls for the United States Navy. One special job was the conversion of six second-class carriages into ambulance cars, for the transport of wounded soldiers. A programme for the construction of carriages intended for North Island Main Trunk service prompted the construction of a new workshop building about 1940, known as Car No. 1 Extension. Though the programme was cancelled after much of the material needed for their construction had been imported, the infrastructure proved useful in the 1950s when the D class electric coaches from Wellington were overhauled there. Other new buildings at the site included a Diesel Shop in 1962, and a new Woodmill to replace the old one that was destroyed in a major fire on 31 May 1955. The machines installed in the new Woodmill were more modern than those available in the old building, resulting in much improved output. Production of carriage stock began soon after opening in 1929, the first of which were 10 50-ft \\"Aa\\" suburban carriages. Another batch of cars was completed for the new Rotorua Limited Express service, including two observation cars. A large number of cars were built prior to the introduction of the 56-ft cars, built between 1937 and 1945. Otahuhu built 207 carriages, 75 guards vans, 3 steam vans, 3 postal vans, and many wagons. With the onset of the diesel age, Otahuhu became involved in the maintenance of diesel locomotives. This started with the small TR tractors in the early 1940s, with the work being carried out in Car Shop No. 2. As the use of diesels increased it was necessary to provide dedicated facilities, with the Steel Wagon Shop being converted for this purpose. In 1958, Otahuhu received the first of its Fiat twin-set railcars for an overhaul, and in 1962 RM 125 was repaired at the workshops following a level crossing accident in Tauranga. Other diesel work conducted at the Steel Shop included the readiness for service of 12 DA class locomotives in 1961, and the restoration of DA 1405 following a major accident. Minor repair work on DE class locomotives was done by the Machine Fitting Group. The ability of Otahuhu to handle diesel-electric locomotive and railcar repair work was much improved in 1962 with the opening of a new Diesel Shop. Prior to entering service, many DA, DB, DH, and DX class locomotives first made a visit to Otahuhu for preparation. 88-seater railcars were also maintained, repaired and overhauled in this new facility. In 1971, the Silver Star carriages were tested and commissioned in the Diesel Shop, as were the Silver Fern railcars the following year. Several cars for the new Southerner service were overhauled at Otahuhu in 1970. In its later years, Otahuhu carried produced more specialist wagons, including for containers and coal, as well as many other variants.  Demise  The Railways Department was replaced by the New Zealand Railways Corporation in 1982. In an effort to alleviate its financial problems and at the direction of its political masters, the Corporation underwent a major restructuring program, which included a review of all its workshops in the 1990s. It was decided to focus the rail engineering resources at two sites: in the North Island at Hutt Workshops, and in the South Island at Hillside Engineering in Dunedin. This resulted in the closure of both the Addington and Otahuhu Workshops. Employees at Otahuhu were informed that the workshops were to close on 30 June 1992. A team of up to 22 employees was kept on for a further six months to decommission the facility. Machines that could be sold were stored in the Structural Shop pending sale by auction. At the time the workshops site was believed to be destined to become an industrial park.  Today  Over half of the original workshops buildings have been demolished since the facility closed. Part of the site is now used as a container storage yard.

Although its intentions are undoubtedly noble this latter-day parable is crude and without force...there is no dialogue, the story is related in \\"voice-of-doom\\" fashion by...the off-screen narrator - it affords its cast little opportunity to develop character. Bamlet L. Price Jr...plays Cholo Martinez, one of the villains who leads the heroine astray, may be listed as an ambitious and busy man. Nothing more. Barbara Marks only occasionally rises to the emotional levels called for in the role of the disturbed lass who drifts from a broken home to an eventually broken marriage, to marijuana, sleeping pills and heroin. The other members of the cast are not effective. Neither is One-Way Ticket to Hell.\\" Steven Pulchaski's review in his book, Slimetime: A Guide to Sleazy, Mindless Movies, was devastating, writing - \\"this is an obscure, anti-drug, anti-juvenile delinquent anti- rebellion morality story, all told in not-so-glorious Dragnet style narration...it's overwrought, paranoid, fearmongering, and totally idiotic...basically, this is drug-paranoia propaganda at its bleakest and least entertaining, with grainy black and white photography, static direction...it just drones on for sixty-or-so minutes, and though the plot tries to be controversial and hard-hitting, the flick is actually so unsleazy that it never gets off the ground\\".

Hill was an American minister in upstate New York who claimed in 1851 that he had invented a color photographic process. Borrowing terms previously introduced in France, Hill called his process \\"heliochromy\\" and the photographs that it produced \\"heliochromes\\", but by analogy to the naming of the then-current daguerreotype process after its inventor Louis Daguerre, Hill's color photographs were soon being called \\"Hillotypes\\". Hill's work was met with skepticism during his lifetime, then for more than a hundred years after his death histories of photography routinely dismissed it as a complete fraud. Later researchers found that his very difficult process did in fact have a limited ability to reproduce the colors of nature. Life and work Levi Hill was, among other things, a Baptist minister in Westkill (Greene County) in the New York Catskill Mountains area. In the early 1840s, Hill learned the daguerreotype process, the only photographic process commonly used during that decade. It yielded black-and-white photographs that reproduced light and shade but not color. By 1851, Hill had worked out his own very different version of the process, which he claimed was able to reproduce the colors of the subject, too. Though many were of the opinion that the color in Hill's photographs was added by hand-tinting, he received support from some in the scientific community, most notably Samuel F. B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph. The claims made for Hill and his commercially unavailable secret process drew both skepticism and wrath from some professional photographers, who believed that clients were putting off having their pictures taken until they could be Hillotyped in color. In 1851, photographer Daniel DeWitt Tompkins Davie, then-president of the Association of Daguerreotypists, assembled an investigating team that pronounced Hill's invention \\"a delusion.\\" In 1856, Hill wrote A Treatise on Heliochromy, a book that promised to reveal his secrets at last. It was available only by advance subscription for $25 a copy,Backer, Wm. B. (1980). \\"Are These The World‚Äôs First Color Photographs?\\" American Heritage, 31:4 (June‚ÄìJuly 1980). Retrieved 10 July 2014. an exorbitant price at that time (in contemporary US gold coins, well over an ounce of pure gold). Davie obtained a court order banning the sale of Hill's book on the grounds that it libeled him and his committee, with the result that most of the edition was pulped. The few surviving copies show that the book consists of a rambling autobiography, a history of photography, a cookbook for many other processes, and finally a recipe for making Hillotypes that is so chemically complicated it is practically unworkable. Hill died in 1865 at the age of 48, possibly a victim of his long and incautious exposure to the many extremely poisonous and corrosive chemicals involved in his experiments. Subsequent research In 1981, photography professor and historian Joseph Boudreau compounded the archaic chemistry and replicated the techniques described by Hill in A Treatise on Heliochromy. Boudreau was able to create Hillotypes that distinctly and verifiably showed muted reproductions of many of the colors in the test subjects photographed, including red, green, blue, yellow, magenta and orange; these colors were all produced by the action of light alone, without the application of dyes or pigments.Boudreau, Joseph.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat in the blockade of Confederate ports. At war's end, she was outfitted as a cargo ship and served in that capacity until finally decommissioned. Massachusetts, an iron-screw steamer built in 1860 at Boston, Massachusetts, was purchased by the Union Navy on May 3, 1861, from the Boston & Southern Steamship Company. The ship was commissioned three weeks later, at Boston Harbor, under the command of Melancton Smith. Civil War service Assigned to the Gulf Blockading Squadron, USS Massachusetts steamed south May 10, 1861, to anchor off Key West, Florida, departing there June 8 for Pensacola, Florida. The next day she took her first prize, British ship Perthshire, near Pensacola. She captured Achilles June 17 and 2 days later took Naham Stetson off Pass a L‚ÄôOutre in coastal Louisiana. On June 23, she captured the Mexican schooner Brilliant and the Confederate blockade-running schooners Trois Freres, Olive Branch, Fanny, and Basile in the Gulf of Mexico. While Massachusetts was absent, the South had fortified Ship Island, and the batteries fired on her when she returned from Pensacola. She engaged the Confederate guns until she ran out of ammunition. On July 13 she seized schooner Hiland near Ship Island, and next day engaged steamers Arrow and Oregon off Chandeleur Islands, forcing them to withdraw. USS Massachusetts captured blockade-running sloop Charles Henry near Ship Island August 7 and gained information on Fort Pike, which guarded the entrance to Lake Pontchartrain for the South. After repairs in early September, Massachusetts fortified Chandeleur Islands and set up a light there September 13. A landing party from the ship took possession of Ship Island September 17, thereby providing the Union Navy with a valuable shelter during storms and the base from which Admiral David Farragut would launch his attack on New Orleans, Louisiana. Returning to Ship Island September 20, USS Massachusetts attacked, causing the South to burn the barracks and desert Ship Island passage. USS Massachusetts operated near strategically important Ship Island through the remainder of the year. She thwarted Confederate efforts to transport freight through the passage December 2, captured a small fishing boat December 12, and turned back Oregon, Pamlico, Gray Cloud, and Florida at Mississippi Sound December 19. Early in 1862 Massachusetts steamed northward to decommission at New York City February 28. Fitted out as a transport and supply ship, she recommissioned April 16 and operated along the Atlantic coast until decommissioning at New York City December 3. USS Massachusetts recommissioned March 10, 1863, and, but for a brief period late that summer, served the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron through the end of the war. She captured sloop Parsis in Wassaw Sound March 12 and with Commodore Perry captured blockade runner Caledonia May 30, 1864, south of Cape Fear after a 2-hour chase. In August she aided steamers Gettysburg and Keystone State in the capture of Confederate steamer Lilian. On March 19, 1865, USS Massachusetts struck a torpedo (mine), which failed to explode, in Charleston Harbor. Post-war decommissioning She was decommissioned September 22, 1865, at New York City and was sold there, at public auction October 1, 1867. Documented February 11, 1868, as Crescent City, she served American commerce until 1872.

Description The Haloxylon persicum has a stout rugged stem and light grey bark, growing up to 4.5‚Äì5 metres in height. It lacks large foliage-type leaves; in fact, its leaves have retrogressed as succulent branches. The plant is found in sandhills, deserts and sand ridges, where it often forms pure stands, with an average density up to 400-500 trees a hectare. The white saxaul is a hardy tree that can grow in nutritionally poor soil and can tolerate drought. The tree is in leaf all year, and flowers in May‚ÄìJune. Uses The plant's extensive root system is useful for stabilising sandy soils. The wood is durable and heavy and is used in general carpentry.

Crescent School. Frank Porter Wood (29 June 1882 - 20 March 1955) was a Canadian businessman and philanthropist. He is best remembered for his many gifts and bequests of artworks to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.  Life and career  Wood was born in Peterborough, Ontario, to Canadian immigrants of mixed parentage: his father was Irish (John W. Wood) and his mother was Scottish (Jane Porter). He married Emma Matilda Junkin in 1906 and had three daughters: Mary (Mollie) Dorothy Porter Wood, Frances (Franie) Junkin Wood and Joyce Rogers Wood. In 1897, he started working in Peterborough as a clerk for the Central Canada Loan and Savings Company, established by Senator George Albertus Cox. In 1899, Wood moved to Montreal to work for the National Trust Company, incorporated a year earlier by Cox and Wood's brother, Edward Rogers Wood. Later in life, he became a Vice-President of the National Trust. In 1903, Wood started up, with Sir Frank Wilton Baillie and his brother James W. Baillie, a brokerage firm called Baillie Brothers and Company (later Baillie, Wood, and Croft), which operated on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In 1910, Wood became President of Burlington Steel. In 1912, the Bankers‚Äô Bond Company Limited was formed to succeed Baillie, Wood, and Croft. Late in 1914, Wood and Sir Frank Baillie collaborated with the owners of the Chadwick Brass Company in Hamilton to set up the large Canadian Cartridge Company Limited, of which Sir Frank Baillie became President and Wood Vice-President. Until his death in 1955, Wood continued to participate in the Canadian business community as a financier. Philanthropy Portrait of a Gentleman, Isaak Abrahamsz Massa by Frans Hals, 1626, donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1955 by Wood. The Harvest Wagon by Thomas Gainsborough, donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1955 by Wood. Wood and his family were consummately modest; they never spoke of their accolades and were quickly forgotten. Wood, however, will be remembered not for his business accomplishments but for his love of the arts and philanthropy. To this date, he is still the single most generous donor to the Art Gallery of Ontario. \\"He is given a place of honour among the earlier collectors of Old Master paintings in Toronto\\", according to David McTavish of Queen's University and a former curator of the Art Gallery of Toronto. Wood was a client of Sir Joseph Duveen. Like most of Duveen's clients, Wood donated his paintings to public institutions, as well as his residence on Bayview Avenue, which was distinguished by its Beaux-Arts architecture (influenced and built by William Adams Delano) and now houses the Crescent School. He died on 20 March 1955 in Toronto, and his major bequests to the Art Gallery of Ontario included The Harvest Wagon by Thomas Gainsborough, Daedalus Warning His Son Icarus by Anthony van Dyck, A Portrait of Dr. Joseph Joachim by John Singer Sargent, Portrait of a Gentleman, Isaak Abrahamsz Massa by Frans Hals, Lady with a Lap Dog by Rembrandt van Rijn, and Portrait of Vincent Laurensz van der Vinne by Frans Hals. Other paintings owned or donated by Wood included artists such as Berthe Morisot, Camille Pissarro, Auguste Renoir, Lambert Sustris, Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, Maurice Utrillo, Claude Monet, Aelbert Cuyp, Auguste Rodin, Francesco Raibolini (known as Francia), Jacopo Comin (Tintoretto), Tiziano Vecelli and Jacob van Ruisdael, to mention only a few.

Appleyard (translator), Letters from Ethiopian Rulers (Early and Mid- Nineteenth Century) (Oxford: British Academy, 1985), p. 50 Background He came to Ethiopia 12 years after the death of the last effective Abuna, Yosab III, at the efforts of Ras Wolde Selassie in the last year of the life of the Ras. No sooner had he left Massawa than he sent forth a demand for a house in Chalacot belonging to Nathaniel Pearce, an Englishman then residing in the country, because the Abuna had heard it was the finest one in the realm. When Pearce refused to give up his home, Qerellos forbade all priests of the Ethiopian Church from providing communion until Pearce changed his mind. Only the efforts of Pearce's wife at last led the Englishman to surrender his house and home to the prelate. Pearce reported that shortly thereafter, Qerellos proclaimed that \\"every man wanting to be confirmed a priest must first bring him four amolehs, or pieces of salt. All new altars, that had been dedicated since the death of the last Abuna, as well as those that had never been consecrated by the Abuna, were to pay also four pieces of salt each; those who wished to become deacons two pieces of salt each; and all the population, with their young children, that had not been confirmed by former Abunas, were to pay one piece of salt each.\\"Pearce, Life and Adventures, vol. II pp. 65f A few weeks later when Selassie died, Chalacot was sacked by the other warlords of the Zemene Mesafint. Both Pearce and Qerellos fled the town for safety elsewhere: Pearce for Adwa, while the Abuna sought sanctuary at the court of Dejazmach Sabagadis. In 1819, the Abuna went to Gondar, where he tried to settle the doctrinal disputes that rent the Ethiopian Church; however, when he allegedly supported the Unctionist formula, Qerellos was forced to flee the city to Tigray Province. Dejazmach Sabagadis apparently extended him protection once again, but eventually came to despise the cleric. A letter he wrote to Pope Peter VII of Alexandria survives, dated to 1827, wherein he complains of the Abuna's behavior, sarcastically asking, \\"Was it because you hated Ethiopia that you sent him? Did you not know his conduct before, [and] so you sent him?\\"Translated with facsimiles of the original text in Sven Rubenson (editor), Correspondence and Treaties (1800-1854) (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1987), pp. 24ff.

A native of Astoria, Queens, Jata is of Polish heritage. He began playing baseball as a left-handed batter. His older brothers persuaded him to become a right-handed batter, and he was a .400 hitter at William Cullen Bryant High School in Astoria, New York. In 1967, Jata was drafted by the Tigers in the 5th round of the 1967 amateur draft. He signed with the Tigers for $10,000. Jata married Mary Olson of Rockwood, Michigan on June 12, 1971. After the wedding, Jata had a 14-game hitting streak for the Toledo Mud Hens. He had a .367 batting average in the 23 games following the ceremony. The Sporting News published a three-column feature story on Jata's post-wedding hitting streak titled \\"Wedded Bliss Helps Hens' Jata to Big Rookie Season\\". Jata spent several years in the Tigers' minor league system with the Lakeland Tigers (1967‚Äì1968), Rocky Mount Leafs (1969), Montgomery Rebels (1970), and Toledo Mud Hens (1971). After an impressive showing in the Tigers' 1972 spring camp, Jata made the big league roster. In April 1972, Detroit manager Billy Martin said he preferred to use Jata as the No. 3 catcher and at first base. The Sporting News reported that \\"his big asset is a level swing as a right-handed pinch-hitter.\\" He played 32 games with the 1972 Tigers (12 games at first base, five in left field, five in right field, and one at catcher) and hit .230 with 17 hits, 8 runs, 3 RBIs and no home runs.

Life He was born on 19 November 1934 in Eora country in the inner city suburb of Balmain, Sydney, New South Wales, but, as he wrote in various papers and books: > When I was born our people had already experienced a holocaust beyond > imagining. There were no Eora living a lifestyle of any kind on the banks of > Tuhbowgule (Sydney Harbour), Kamay (Botany Bay) or Deerubin (Hawkesbury > River). My birthplace had experienced a massacre from 1790 to 1802 and my > people were our country's first resistance fighters Syron also lived an indigenous life with his paternal grandmother in his ancestral Birrippi lands at Minimbah, New South Wales, seven miles (11 km) up the Coolongolook River from Forster and north of Balmain. Minimbah means in Birripi language \\"Home of the Teacher\\" and his traditional country encompassed Taree, Forster and the Great Lakes area of the Wang Wauk and Coolonglook rivers on the North Coast. He was a child of a bicultural marriage with his mother coming from the coal fields of Yorkshire, England. His paternal dreaming was the Eagle, although he described himself as a Magpie - half black, half white. He was also exposed to Aboriginal mission life at Purfleet and Forster through the 1930s and early 1940s and spent time as a 14- and 15-year-old in Grafton Correctional Centre. Even with this background, Syron told the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) on 15 November 1992: > I have no mortgage on being dispossessed or having a tough life. We've all > had it. Every Aboriginal person I know of in my generation has had one hell > of a time. Nobody has a mortgage on that. We've all been through it. Our > obligation, our mandate, as artists is to communicate with our people > first.{Syron, HREOC, 15.11.92} Brian Syron died of leukaemia on 14 October 1993 in his Eora country birthplace. Theatrical career Syron began his artistic career in 1960 at the Ensemble Theatre, Kirribilli, Sydney under the guidance of New York trained American actor/director and esteemed teacher of the Strasberg Method, the late Hayes Gordon. His fellow students included Jack Thompson, Clarissa Kaye Mason, Reg Livermore and John Ewing. Syron always believed that it was Gordon who gave him the dream to be part of the theatre by allowing him to experiment, expand and create. Wishing to travel overseas, Syron was forced to deny that he was Indigenous in order to obtain an Australian passport. This was because Indigenous Australians were not allowed to have passports.Eckersley, M. (2012). Australian Indigenous Drama. Tasman Press. Altona. Syron left Australia in 1961 to work in Europe as a male model with Dior, Cardin and Balenciaga. In the Fall of 1961, he moved to New York living initially on Fifth Avenue with one of Australia's first supermodels, Pauline Kiernan, and later in a small walk up when he became an acting student again. In September 1961, he was accepted as a student with the Stella Adler Studio, where he studied for the next 18 months with fellow students Robert De Niro, Gloria Graham, Pamela Tiffen, Warren Beatty and Peter Bogdanovich. Then followed two years of study under various teachers including Olympia Dukakis, Sanford Meisner, William Bell and Rose Ingram while continuing study with Adler. As a result of this 3¬Ω years of training, Syron became the first Australian, indigenous or non-indigenous, to study with Stella Adler and one of the few Australians to have learned the Stanislavsky drama technique from so close to the source ‚Äì \\"the source was almost pure - only one place removed.\\" {Syron} Completing his American training, he spent 12 months in Britain studying with Cicily Berry as well as Doreen Cannon, head of acting, at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art before returning to New York. There, he co-founded a theatre company based around the Caff√® Lena in Saratoga Springs, upstate New York while touring as a director with the Boston/Herald Travellers Shakespeare Company with such actors as Spalding Gray and Clara Duff-McCormack and doing stints as a teacher for Adler's studio. In 1965, Mrs. Hollister Rexford Shause donated the Caff√® Lena theatre company on the Mohawk River near Schenectady to build a theatre complex. Following this donation, Syron returned to New York, where he worked as an actor on various American Shakespeares festivals, toured through the Appalachian Mountains and worked with the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, Cincinnati in the Park, as well as productions in Ohio, New Jersey and Paducah, Kentucky. As well as touring, he worked as an actor with the Establishment Theatre Company for producers Sybill Burton Christopher, Joseph E. Levine, Ivor David Balding, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. He worked for The New Theatre on 53rd and 3rd and various productions including the revue The Mad Show. In the last months of 1967 and the first of 1968 Syron toured the Southern states of America playing in Atlanta, Georgia; Roanoke, Virginia; Nashville, Tennessee and Raleigh- Durham, North Carolina and from these tours he was to say > \\"came the finalisation of my black politicisation. No black person > travelling through these States during this period of peace marches, race > riots and assassination could have remained untouched and I had to go home.\\" > { Kicking Down the Doors Syron } Syron returned to Perth, Western Australia following the 1967 referendum which finally allowed him to freely move through his country without having to have a Permission to Leave Pass to let him go about his business. In Perth, he directed at Arnie Neeme's The Playhouse, Perth. He had hardly time to settle into Perth before he was invited to return to Sydney and direct Fortune and Men's Eyes at his old alma mater the Ensemble Theatre, Kirribilli for which he received the Inaugural Drama Critics Award for Best Production and his leading man Max Phipps received Best Actor for his role of \\"Queenie\\". On his return from the United States in late 1970, Syron was invited to join Sydney's Old Tote Theatre by Professor Robert Quentin, Head of Drama at the University of New South Wales, and Robin Lovejoy, Artistic Director. He was the first Indigenous Australia to work as a director in the mainstream Australian theatre industry and in 1972 was appointed Theatre Consultant for the Aboriginal Arts Board of the inaugural Australia Council for the Arts which Board was headed for the first time by an indigenous person, Wanjuk Marika. The following year, 1973, Syron co-founded the Australian National Playwrights Conference with Katharine Brisbane. Lloyd Richards, Head of Acting at Yale University and Artistic Director of the American National Playwrights Conference wrote to the Aboriginal Unit of Australia Council in September 1993 > I have been asked to comment on Brian Syron whom I have not heard of in many > years. I am nonetheless not hesitant to do so because his contribution to > the theatre and to his people had by the late 70s been so significant that > he might have been considered for award by then. The National Playwrights > Conference of Australia exists because Brian Syron visited the National > Playwrights Conference in Waterford Conn. and recognised it as an important > idea for Australia and he went back to champion the possibility. Others > visited and the rest is history.\\" {Lloyd G. Richards, 9.5.1993} Syron returned to the theatre again in 1976 with his direction of Dimboola (written by Jack Hibberd) in Newcastle, New South Wales as well as at Bonapartes Theatre Restaurant, Kings Cross, Sydney where his stage production ran continuously for the next two years and four months with many cast changes during that time. He followed \\"Dimboola\\" with a production of the American play Falling Apart at the New Theatre, Newtown, Sydney and in 1978 he played the role of \\"The Actor\\" in Livieu Cieleu's production of Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths which ran for six weeks at the Sydney Opera House. In this same year, he opened The New Group Theatre at the All Nations Club, Kings Cross, Sydney where he directed among other productions A Tribute to Tennessee Williams before the ongoing costs of keeping an independent theatre going forced Syron to close after 12 months. Syron co-founded the Aboriginal Theatre Company (ATC) in 1981 with Robert Merritt, scriptwriter/playwright/director and, in conjunction with the Aboriginal Educational Unit of TAFE, was the founder of the Eora Arts Centre, Redfern, Sydney. The first production of the ATC was Merritt's play The Cake Man which toured under Syron's direction, to the 1982 World Theatre Festival in Denver, Colorado where the play received a tremendous audience response.Katharine Brisbane, Theatre Critic, Sydney Morning Herald Following this success, the play then toured various colleges around the United States. Returning to Australia, Syron directed a season of The Cake Man at the Universal Theatre in Fitzroy, Melbourne after which it was funded by Australian federal government's Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs to play at the 1983 Warana - Commonwealth Arts Festival, Brisbane in Queensland where it was performed at the Edward Street Theatre.Eckersley M. (2012). Australian Indigenous Drama. Tasman Press. Altona. In January 1987, Syron founded the National Black Playwrights Conference (NPBC), which was held at the Australian National University, Canberra. In an interview with Angela Bennie, Australia's leading Indigenous actress Justine Saunders commented : > It was Brian Syron, in fact, who was the instigator not only of the first > National Black Playwrights Conference but the National Playwrights > Conference. Syron always said our culture is an oral one, it comes through > our painting, through our singing, through our stories that's how we pass > down our laws, that's how we have passed down our history for 60,000 > yearsBennie, Angela, \\"A Modern Stage for Stories yet Unheard\\" Sydney Morning > Herald, 6.28.1993:19 During the conference, the delegates awarded Syron the 1987 Inaugural Harold Blair Award for his Lifetime Achievements in the Performing Arts, which brought with it the additional honor of the title \\"Elder\\".Eckersley. M.(ed.) 2009. Drama from the Rim: Asian Pacific Drama Book. Drama Victoria. Melbourne. 2009. (p7-9) As a result of the first NBPC, Syron proposed and co-founded the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust (ANTT) with headquarters in King Street, Newtown under Administrator, scriptwriter Vivian Walker (son of poet Oodgeroo Noonuccal and brother of actor Dennis Walker), Chair, actor Lydia Miller and directors Justine Saunders, Rhoda Roberts, Lillian Crombie and Syron. ANTT closed in 1991 following the very early death of Vivian Walker. At the second NBPC held in 1988 Syron directed a video of Jimmy Chi's stage musical Bran Nue Dae produced by Chi who travelled from Broome in Western Australia to Macquarie University at North Ryde, Sydney to take part in the event. Syron carried out a two-week workshop, a stage reading, plus a production in 1991 at the Belvoir Street Theatre, Redfern, Sydney of Mudrooroo Narogin's \\"courageous and brave new play\\"Syron, Kicking Down the Doors: 370 \\"The Aboriginal Demonstrators Confront the Declaration of the Australian Republic on 26 January 2001 with the Production of Der Auftrag by Heiner Muller\\" and starring Justine Saunders, Michael Watson, David Kennedy, Pamela Young, Ray Kelly and Graham Cooper. The play and the production are also the subject of Mudrooroo Narogin's book The Mudrooroo/Muller Project - A Theatrical Casebook, with a chapter by Syron and edited by Gerhard Fischer in collaboration with leading indigenous academic Paul Behrendt and Syron.

Following on the success of the Master Class, Syron was requested to introduce an Intermediate classes and then a Beginners class, both of limited numbers. The School was kept open on an ad hoc basis over the next 23 years and moved many times between 1969 and 1992. In 1969 Syron taught the first group of urban Aboriginal actors to every study Stanislavsky or acting from an Indigenous perspective. The classes were held at the Foundation of Aboriginal Affairs, George Street (near Central railway station), Sydney CBD and the actors included political and cultural historian/actor Denis Walker (son of leading Australian poet Oodroonoo Nunuccal) and actor/director/historian Gary Foley. The situation was still so bad that at the end of each evening the actors had to be ferried back by taxi to their homes in Redfern about 10 minutes walk away to avoid arrest by the police. He followed this in the early 1972 with workshops and acting classes held at the Black Theatre Arts & Cultural Centre (aka Black Theatre), Cope Street, Redfern where, as Artistic Director, he taught such future Indigenous luminaries as Jack Davis, Hyllus Maris, Lester Bostock, Maureen Watson and Gerry Bostock. In 1973, as a foundation member of the Peter Summerton Foundation, Syron organised with his mentor Stella Adler to travel to Australia and conduct a series of Master Classes for people from all areas of the Australian entertainment industries. This was the only time Ms. Adler travelled to Australia. As a result of these classes, Syron instigated The Artists' Group Theatre with the first workshops being held in the sculpture studio of Ron Robertson-Swann before moving to The Stables, Kings Cross. During this year he was invited to teach drama to The Resurgent Society inmates of Parramatta Gaol. He accepted the offer and was involved with the Society for the next 12 months. His group included playwrights Jim McNeil and Robin Thurston and Syron is believed to be the first drama teacher to work in the prison system of New South Wales. At the end of 1974 Syron returned to Los Angeles to take up a Stella Adler's invitation to work at the Stella Adler Los Angeles Acting Studio on Hollywood Boulevard with such students as John Barrymore Jr., John Saxon, Susan Clark and Peter Brown. Leading Indigenous academic and Harvard University, USA graduate, Dr Roberta Sykes set up the Black Women's Action Group in 1985 with Syron as the (anonymous) Honorary Secretary and foundation member joining other Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the support of the educational advancement of Indigenous women in their pursuit of academic success at leading international universities. Over the period 1986‚Äì1987 Syron became the first Indigenous Australian to lecture at the Australian Film TV & Radio School (AFTRS) when he gave a series of Master Classes covering \\"The Textual Analysis and Techniques of Acting\\" for Final Year AFTRS students in the Directors Course. In Australia's Bi-Centennial Year, 1988, Syron, as representative of actors and the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust, was invited back to AFTRS as a Guest Lecturer for the \\"Writing '88\\" Course along with Fay Nelson (Lecturer in Storytelling/Aboriginal Arts Board), Tjungkarta \\"Nosepeg\\" Tjupurrula (Pintubi Storyteller) and Harper Morris Tyungerrayi (Anmatjuo Storyteller).

Almost immediately after this production Syron was cast as Ray in \\"Ray's Story\\" a one-hour episode of Pig in a Poke (1977) a 5 √ó 1 hour series screened on ABC-TV starring Justine Saunders, Athol Compton, Gary Foley and Paul Coe and described as the first modern urban Aboriginal drama screened on Australian television. Syron then played the leading role of \\"The Wife Abuser\\" in director Stephen Wallace's telemovie Women Who Kill (1983) which screened on ATN Channel 9. In 1987 Syron was executive producer of the documentary-drama film production Karbara: First Born (1987), directed and produced by Richard Guthrie, during and following the 1987 Australian National Playwrights Conference. The film featured Lydia Miller and Ernie Dingo and screened at the Sydney Film Festival in 1987 and on ABC-TV. Syron and Justine Saunders were co-presenters of the ABC-TV Aboriginal entertainment series The First Australians (1988‚Äì1990). This series of 18 √ó 1 hour programs featured leading Aboriginals in the fields of performance, music and art and presented Indigenous Australian political and commercial leaders in discussions on various topics important to Indigenous Australians. In September 1988 Syron became the first Aboriginal producer at ABC-TV when he was appointed to the position of Producer - Aboriginal Programs Unit. > \\"The appointment of Brian Syron by the ABC as producer of its new Aboriginal > Programs Unit could very well precipitate further muttering and > grumbling...is it just another Bi Centennial cringe and guilt or is there a > need and a reason for an Aboriginal; Unit ... the unification of culture is > the only way to ensure their survival\\" (Doug Anderson, SMH, 9.19.1988 : 20) Television Production * Seven Little Australians (1974) - Children's Dialogue Coach * Karbara : First Born (1986) - Executive Producer * ABC-TV Aboriginal Programs Unit - Producer Acting * The Cake Man (1977) - Sweet William * Pig in a Poke (1977) - Ray * Women Who Kill (1983) - The Wife Abuser * The First Australians (1988‚Äì1990) Series Co-presenter with Justine Saunders Film career In 1970 Syron left Australia for the USA where he took up a position as Attachment / Assistant on the feature film What's Up Doc? directed by Peter Bogdanovich. Syron's next film project was the short film Jeremy and Teapot (1976) starring Patrick Thompson as Jeremy and Syron as Teapot with the Narrator Jack Thompson, shot on location at Thompson's property at Upper Bo Bo, via Ulong, northern New South Wales. The film went on to win Best Film, 1982 Women's International Film/Video Festival, Tucson, Arizona, USA.. Syron was employed on director Peter Weir's feature film The Last Wave (1977) as Consultant and Aboriginal Liaison with Gulpilil and Nandijiwarra Amagula, Walter Amagula, Roy Bara, Cedric Latara, Morris Latara and Athol Compton. The Australian Film Commission awarded Syron a grant in 1980 for his script Australian Aboriginal Achievers (1980), which was a biographical documentary recounting the achievements of seven leading Aboriginal achievers: actor/historian Gary Foley, potter Thancoupie, artist Jean Jimmi, bureaucrat Charles Perkins, academic Miriam Rose Ungunmeer-Bauman and artists Jimmy Bienderry and Stumpy Martin Jempijimpa. The script never received production funding and was later used as the basis for the Clare Dunn book People Under the Skin - An Irish Immigrant's Experience of Aboriginal Australia. In 1981, Syron played a small role of \\"The Neighbour\\" in The City's Edge (1983) (aka Running Man Edge of the City)\\", co-written by Robert Merritt the first Australian Indigenous scriptwriter of a feature film and the Nightclub Manager in Coolangatta Gold (1983). Backlash (1986) directed and produced by Bill Bennett featured Lydia Miller with Syron in the role of The Executioner or Kadachi Man. Syron and the lead actors were the co-writers of this production although they were uncredited by Bennett. The script improvisation by the actors is confirmed by Encore > \\"Bill Bennett's \\"Backlash\\", for instance, is a film for which the principals > improvised their dialogue...in this his latest effort he tested this > technique to its limit\\" (Encore, 24 April - 7 May 1986 : 6) Syron and Rosalie Kunoth-Monks (aka Ngarla Kunoth, the star of Jedda in 1956) were employed as Co-Aboriginal Consultants on the television production Naked Under Capricorn (1989) directed by Rob Stewart, produced by Syron's brother- in-law Ray Alchin and starring Nigel Havers. From 1990 to 1992 Syron directed the first feature film by an Indigenous Australia Jindalee Lady (1992) and is recognised as being the first First Nations director of a feature film. Dr Lowitja O'Donoghue, Chair of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission wrote saying > Mr Syron is held in high esteem by both indigenous and non-indigenous > Australians for his work as our first indigenous feature film director..He > has made a valuable contribution to indigenous art in this country and has > been a strong and articulate advocate in the movement to raise and promote > the status of indigenous theatre and film as an integral part of Australia's > cultural heritage\\" (O'Donoghue, letter to Russell Mulvey, Edmonton, Canada, > 8.12.1992) In August 1992 Jindalee Lady was invited to screen at the 1992 inaugural Brisbane International Film Festival as part of the first Charles Chauvel Tribute which was followed by a debate between Indigenous filmmaker Syron and three non-Indigenous filmmakers concerning the invisibility of Indigenous above-the-line personnel. In September 1992 Jindalee Lady was invited to \\"Dreamspeakers\\" International Film & Arts Festival, Edmonton, Canada where it was the only and the first feature film to be directed by a First Nations person and was awarded Best Feature Film at the Festival. Following this screening Jindalee Lady was accepted and nominated for the East West Award - Best Film at the 1992 Hawaii International Film Festival (HIFF), Hawaii where Syron gave a paper The Making of an Indigenous Feature Film at the opening of the Festival and the screening of Jindalee Lady. Syron was joined by leading lady Lydia Miller and Musical Director / Composer Bart Willoughby at the HIFF. Briann Kearney and Syron applied in a joint application for a Literary Fellowship from Australia Council the federal Arts organisation and were awarded $20,000 to co-write \\"Kicking Down the Doors - a History of Indigenous Filmmaking from 1968‚Äì1993 including non-Indigenous films for and about Indigenous people\\" based on research collected by Syron for his submission to the 1992 HREOC submission.

It is similar to Cucurbita californica, Cucurbita cordata, Cucurbita cylindrata, and Cucurbita digitata and all these species hybridize readily. It was first identified by Sereno Watson in 1876. These species form the only restricted xerophyte species group in the genus Cucurbita. Each member of this species group is native to the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico where they are relatively uncommon. Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well- drained. C. palmata is native to northeastern Baja California, southeastern California, and southwestern Arizona to a point near the Colorado River. The juvenile leaves of C. cylindrata, C. cordata, C. digitata, and C. palmata show a high degree of similarity, but their mature leaves are visibly different, as are their root structures. C. palmata and C. digitata are sympatric, with C. palmata separating the ranges of C. digitata at the juncture of Baja California, California, and Arizona. C. palmata fruits are diffuse green mottle that turns yellow at maturity, striped, and round. Description Cucurbita palmata is a sprawling vine with rough, stiff-haired stems and leaves. The dark green, light-veined leaves are sharply palmate with usually five long triangular points. The stiff, curling yellow flowers are 6 to 8 centimeters wide. The plant bears smooth spherical or oblate squash fruits 8 to 10 centimeters wide. The fruits may be bright yellow to dark green and may have white stripes. The fruit is distasteful and not edible.

Our commitment to Customer Success means we get customers up and running in as little as 90 days. The company was originally formed in 2001 as OpenMFG and rebranded as xTuple in 2007. The company is privately held. History xTuple began under the name OpenMFG, developing its product of the same name beginning in the year 2001. Jeffrey Lyon, the original developer cofounded OpenMFG with Ned Lilly in October 2001. xTuple headquarters, Norfolk, Virginia OpenMFG was a commercially licensed ERP system targeted toward small to midsize manufacturers. The company adopted a \\"community code\\" model, meaning that customers who purchase or subscribe to licenses for the product have access to view and modify the source code. Unlike open source software, however, the code was not made publicly available. OpenMFG spent several years building its product, and settled into a release cycle of roughly one major release every twelve months. The version 2.0 of OpenMFG (released in 2006) added Master Production Schedule, multi-currency, and CRM, filling the most obvious gaps in its claim on true mid-tier ERP functionality. Jeffrey Lyon departed OpenMFG in 2004 to eventually found SabeSoft to continue development of its mid-range ERP system, initially based on licensed OpenMFG functionality but, since, progressing to become a wholly unique product. The project was originally to be released under the \\"xTuple License,\\" a derivative of the Mozilla Public License, but xTuple was quickly criticized for introducing \\"yet another\\" open source license variant. However, at that very same conference SocialText announced the release of the new Open Source Initiative approved Common Public Attribution License (CPAL). Two days later xTuple switched PostBooks to CPAL and became the second company to adopt this licenses which is the licenses in use today. Products The PostBooks¬Æ Edition of xTuple ERP is a Free (for up to four users, five or more users requires a commercial licenseUsing PostBooks¬Æ ‚Äî the community version of xTuple ‚Äî requires a software license key.

The Distribution, Manufacturing, and Enterprise Editions are commercially licensed Enterprise resource planning solutions. All three products are built on the same Open source technology foundation, and share the same code base. The commercial Editions have more functionality for larger companies.  Technology  xTuple ERP provides multiple interface options including a locally installable GUI client application, a web client, and a web services API for third party application integration. = GUI Client = The GUI client is written in Qt, a C++ toolkit for application development. It lets application developers target all major operating systems (Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac) with a single application source code. Qt provides a platform-independent API to all central platform functionality: GUI, database access, networking, file handling, etc. The Qt library encapsulates the different APIs of different operating systems, providing the application programmer with a single, common API for all operating systems. The native C APIs are encapsulated in a set of object-oriented C++ classes. =Web Client= There is a browser-based web client in versions 4.4.0 through 4.9.5. It was deprecated in v4.10.0 and will be removed by v5.0.0. This web client was built entirely in JavaScript using the Enyo framework for presentation and Backbone.js for model handling. =Web Services= The web client application is served by a NodeJS server, which also provides a REST based web services API that can be used for third party integration. The web services API uses Google's Discovery Service model to provide a self documenting interface. =Database= xTuple uses the PostgreSQL database exclusively for storing and managing data. The GUI client relies heavily on PostgreSQL's native procedural language (PL/pgSQL) functions to process business logic, while the web client and node layers leverage additional capability made possible by the integration of Google's V8 JavaScript engine into the database using an extension known as PLV8. xTuple has written an Object-relational mapping system embedded in the database using JavaScript that processes all reads and transaction requests made via the NodeJS server.

Its name derives from the nearly 180-degree turn, from generally eastwards to generally westwards and resembling the shape of a shepherd's crook, which the River Devon makes at the village. History It is located on what was a major medieval east-west route between Stirling and St Andrews at the lowest point on the river which is often fordable, and where it was crossed by a major north-south road from Glen Devon (the main pass through the Ochil Hills range to the north) that skirted around the bend in the river. The combination of crossroads and ford encouraged an early settlement, and in 1615 it was raised to a Burgh of Barony by James VI for the local landowner John Halliday of Tullibole. The classic triangular shape of its marketplace can still be seen in the roads and field boundaries of the Back Crook area close to the former ford, although the diversion away from the marketplace of both of its major roads with the construction of the Rumbling Bridge and Crook of Devon bridges in the following 150 years prevented it taking off as a commercial hub, so while the Back Crook remained or reverted to being relatively undeveloped, the focus of the village gradually moved southwards to coalesce along the new east-west road, now the A977, and its character is now largely 19th century. It was infamous in the 17th century for its witch trials and executions. Down the road at the side of the Institute (Village Hall) on the right side is a field called Lamblaires and in the northwest corner is the place where the witches were strangled and their bodies burned at the stake. In 1789 the heirs of the Hallidays of Tullibole suffered a financial crisis and large parts of the estate were sold off, including the by-now almost abandoned marketplace which was bought by the Moodie family of the neighbouring estate of Moor (now Naemoor, its land having been drained in the 19th century). They dismantled and salvaged the stone of its symbolic mercat cross, although a surviving relic of the cross shaft suggests that it must have been a substantial construction, probably not unlike that at Clackmannan or Doune. In the 1830s the Naemoor Estate was bought by the Moubray family, major shareholders of the Alloa Coal company, and the 19th century expansion of the village was continued largely under their control. The estate was broken up and sold on May 16, 1946, and almost all of its houses are now owned individually. Modern housing developments began in the 1960s and 70s but the major development of West Crook Way at the west end of the village was built in the 1990s. Fossoway Church The church dates from 1729 and was remodelled in 1806. It replaced the two parish churches at Tullibole and Fossoway, each of which had served separate parishes until their combination into a single parish in 1614. These were demolished in or shortly after 1729. The Elizabeth Wilkie Hall was added in 2000. Famous residents *James Haig Ferguson FRSE (1862‚Äì1934) surgeon, born in the manse in Fossoway.

Her most famous works are the novels Corregidora (1975), Eva's Man (1976), and The Healing (1998). Early life Jones was born on November 23, 1949, to Franklin and Lucille Jones. She grew up in Speigle Heights, a neighborhood of Lexington, Kentucky, in a house with no indoor toilet. Her father was a restaurant cook and her mother, who wished to be a writer, stayed at home. Young Gayl grew up in a storytelling family: Her grandmother wrote plays for her church, and her mother constantly made up stories to entertain the children and other family members. As Gayl recalls, \\"I began to write when I was seven, because I saw my mother writing, and because she would read stories to my brother and me, stories that she had written\\".Jones, Gayl (Amanda). (2000). In African-American Writers: A Dictionary. Although described as painfully shy, many of Jones's elementary school instructors recognized her writing skills and encouraged her talent to grow Education Jones is a 1971 graduate of Connecticut College, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in English. While attending the college she also earned the Frances Steloff Award for Fiction. She then began a graduate program in creative writing at Brown University, studying under poet Michael Harper and earning a Master of Arts in 1973 and a Doctor of Arts in 1975. Career Jones's mentor, Michael Harper, introduced her work to author Toni Morrison. Morrison was an editor at Random House at the time and was so impressed after reading Jones's manuscript once wrote, \\"that no novel about any black woman could ever be the same after this\\". In 1975, Jones published her first novel Corregidora at the age of 26. That same year she was a visiting lecturer at the University of Michigan, which hired her the following year as an assistant professor. She left her faculty position in 1983 and moved to Europe, where she wrote and published Die Vogelfaengerin (The Birdwatcher) in Germany, and a poetry collection, Xarque and Other Poems. Jones's 1998 novel The Healing was a finalist for the National Book Award, although the media attention surrounding her novel's release focused more on the controversy in her personal life than on the work itself. Her papers are currently housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. Jones currently lives in Lexington, Kentucky, where she continues to write. Jones has described herself as an improvisor, and her work bears out that statement: like a jazz or blues musician, Jones plays upon a specific set of themes, varying them and exploring their possible permutations. Though her fiction has been called \\"Gothic\\" in its exploration of madness, violence, and sexuality, musical metaphors might make for a more apt categorization.Byerman, K., \\"Black Vortex: The Gothic Structure of Eva's Man\\", Journal of the Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States 7 (1980): 93‚Äì101. Personal life While studying at the University of Michigan, Jones met a politically active student, Robert Higgins, who would eventually become her husband. At a gay rights parade in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the early 1980s, Higgins claimed to be God and that AIDS was a form of punishment. After being punched by a woman at the parade, he returned with a shotgun and was arrested with a charge that carried four years in jail. Instead of appearing in court to face charges, Jones and Higgins fled the United States to Europe, and Jones resigned from the University of Michigan with a note addressed to President Ronald Reagan that read: \\"I reject your lying racist [expletive], and I call upon God. Do what you want. God is with Bob and I'm with him.\\" Some have debated the authorship of the note. In 1988, Jones and Higgins returned to the United States, but kept their identities hidden. In the late 1990s, Jones's mother was diagnosed with throat cancer, and in 1997, Higgins objected to a medical procedure for his mother-in-law, but was banned from the hospital room after a psychological evaluation on Jones's mother found she was \\"inappropriately manipulated by family--especially son-in-law.\\" Jones and Higgins wrote up a document about the incident called \\"Kidnapped/Held Incommunicado,\\" which was sent to the national press, and on March 3, 1997, was forwarded to President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. On March 20, Jones's mother died, igniting Higgins to start a campaign against the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center, which had been the defendant in several civil rights cases in the recent past. During this time, Jones's novel The Healing was in the process of being released. Higgins began to bombard the Lexington police, calling them and writing them multiple times a day. A letter that arrived to the police station on February 20, 1998, indicated a bomb threat, and police figured out that Higgins, who at the time was using the alias Bob Jones, was previously wanted for arrest. After a standoff with police at their residence, Higgins committed suicide and Jones was put on suicide watch. Since then, Jones only talks to family and Harper and has refused several requests for interviews.

Its publication coincided with the peak of the Black Arts Movement and concepts of \\"Africanism.\\" It was precursor to the Women's Renaissance of the 1980s, often identified by its acknowledgement of the multiplicity of African- American identities and renewed interest in history and slavery. Authors associated with the Black Women's Movement include Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Paule Marshall, among others. The novel moves across different geographic spaces, from Brazil, to a moment in St. Louis, but is predominantly set in Kentucky. Ursa Corregidora, the novel's protagonist, is a blues singer searching for \\"a song that would touch me, touch my life and theirs ... A song branded with the new world\\" (59). Ursa's search reflects her struggle to construct selfhood amidst the traumatic stories told by her great-grandmother and grandmother of their experiences at the hands of the Portuguese Brazilian slaveholder Simon Corregidora. Ursa's matrilineal line‚Äîgreat-grandmother, grandmother, and mother‚Äîmake it their lives' purpose to keep alive the history of their abuse and torture, and by extension that of African slaves in the New World. From the age of five onward, Ursa inherits the duty to \\"make generations\\" that can testify to the brutal crimes of slavery. But the Corregidora women's obsession with the past burdens Ursa, who struggles, as a singer, to find her own purpose in life. Even as she attempts to do so, she herself is trapped in abusive relationships. When Ursa and her husband Mutt get into a physical altercation regarding her refusal to stop singing, she falls (or is pushed) down a flight of stairs, loses her unborn baby, and has an emergency hysterectomy. The year is 1948. Unable to birth the generations necessary to pass down the Corregidora narrative, Ursa loses any fragile sense of self she previously had. She divorces Mutt, unwilling to forgive him for taking away her sole purpose in life, and attempts to heal under the watchful eyes of her friends Tadpole McCormick (owner of Happy's Caf√©, where Ursa sings) and Catherine Lawson (bisexual hairstylist, who lives across the street from Happy's). Ursa moves in with Cat briefly after realizing her stay at Tad's is forcing romantic relations with him. However, at Cat's, Ursa receives unwanted sexual attention from a young girl Jeffy, who she realizes is Cat's lover. Confronted with their lesbianism, Ursa promptly returns to Tad's, and the two marry shortly thereafter. Yet, Ursa and Tad's marriage fails to be any different from the abusive, possessive relationship with Mutt. Ursa finds Tad in bed with another woman and moves out. Jones succinctly renders the destructive romantic relationships between Black men and women, a lingering effect of the patriarchal slave system where Black bodies were abused and consumed. In order to heal, Ursa seeks out her mother's story, a tale overshadowed by Great Gram and Gram's experiences in Old Man Corregidora's plantation-brothel. Mama, similarly taught to associate sex with violence, has only slept with one man, Ursa's father Martin, on one occasion. Despite his willingness to marry her and move in with her, Mama was unable to reciprocate a romantic relationship and eventually caused Martin to hate her. Martin returned the humiliation he felt when Mama visited him after the birth of Ursa. After smacking Mama around, Martin ripped her clothes and made her walk through the streets like a \\"whore.\\" Mama and Martin's relationship exemplifies what could happen to Ursa if she doesn't find a way to live her own life, rather than just rehearsing that of her foremothers. With this new knowledge, Ursa redoubles her efforts in blues singing and begins to heal. When she reunites with Mutt, 22 years after their divorce, the two attempt to reconcile. During an act of fellatio, Ursa decides not to repeat her great- grandmother's secret act in which she bit the penis of Old Man Corregidora. Critics have interpreted this ending very differently: some seeing Ursa's refusal to repeat the past a sign of a disruption of the obliterating cycle and indicative of her reconciliation with Mutt, while others argue Ursa fails to resist abusive heterosexual relationships and therefore becomes a passive, unrealized heroine. Incest is a major theme in a novel, and a recurring trope in the works of other prominent African-American writers at the time, including: Toni Morrison (The Bluest Eye), Maya Angelou's (I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings), Alice Walker's (The Child Who Favored Daughter), and James Baldwin's (Just Above My Head). Aliyyah Abdur-Rahman, in her book Against the Closet: Identity, Political Longing, and Black Figuration, discusses incest as a \\"central trope through which black female identity and black familial dilemmas are figured in African American women's writing in the period after black Americans were purportedly granted equal rights before the law\\".Abdur- Rahman, Aliyyah. Against the Closet: Identity, Political Longing, and Black Figuration. Duke University Press: 2012, 117. In her close readings of late twentieth-century African-American literary texts, Abdur-Rahman's argues that writing about the trope of incest in black women's literature illuminates the continuing impact of slavery on the formation of black families in the post- civil rights period. Abdur-Rahman sees the incest motif as a site to \\"critique society for its egregious neglect of black women and children.\\"Abdur-Rahman, 2012, 118. By focusing on the time period of the late twentieth century, when Corregidora was written, Abdur-Rahman reads the employment of the incest motif as a critique on the masculinity inherent in black nationalism and its impact on the formation of black families. She writes, \\"I argue that representing incest allows black American women writers to highlight he effects of civil rights retrenchment and the waning popularity of a largely masculinist black nationalist agenda on black families in the late twentieth century.\\" Throughout the novel, Ursa must navigate relationships of control over her body and sexuality imposed by different characters. Her relatives (Great-Gram, Gram and her mother) need her body to serve as a tool of procreation (make generation) and produce a child that represents material evidence of the horrors of incest and rape they experienced during slavery at the hands of Simon Corregidora. The rape and incest that occurs between Great Gram, Gram and Simon can be read as complicating the notions of love and hate, desire and danger. Similarly, Ursa's relationship with her husband Mutt also straddles the line between the two sentiments. Mutt seeks to restrict Ursa's sexuality only for his enjoyment and pushes her down the stairs at the beginning of the novel because of his jealousy at other men staring at her on-stage performance while she sings the Blues. Her second husband, Tad, seeks to engage with Ursa's sexuality in a normative manner that illustrates his ability to provide sexual pleasure for her, despite her hysterectomy and modified sexual desire. Jones complicates notions of sexuality by showing how desire can exist in undesirable circumstances. Or as Ursa sees it, \\"Two humps on the same camel? Yes. Hate and desire both riding them\\" (102). Sparse in language, relying on terse dialogue and haunting interior monologues, the novel stands in the naturalist tradition as it shows individuals fighting with historical forces beyond their control. However, the end of the novel justifies its status as a \\"blues\\" narrative exploring both the pain and the beauty of relationships by implying that psychological struggle and an unsparing confrontation of the past may lead to recovery. When asked about the relationship between literate and oral traditions in Corregidora Jones said, \\"Ursa in Corregidora tells her own story in her own language and so does Eva in Eva's Man. I was interested in having their language do everything that anybody's language used as a literary language can do. But once after I gave a talk on Corregidora, a professor (I should say a white professor) expressed surprise that I didn't talk like Ursa. That my vocabulary wasn't like hers. The implication of course was that I was more \\"articulate,\\" at least within an accepted linguistic tradition. So because of that and because of other things‚Äîother comments about my language in those books‚ÄîI've been wondering about my own voice‚Äîmy other voice(s) and how it (they) relate to the voices of those women. I trust those voices, but always with black writers there's the suspicion that they can't create language/voices as other writers can‚Äîthat they can't invent a linguistic world in the same way.\\"Rowell, Charles H., \\"An Interview with Gayl Jones\\". Callaloo, no. 16, 1982, pp. 32‚Äì53. Eva's Man Eva's Man (1976), Jones's second novel, expands on the pain between African-American women and men, but it does so with an even greater sense of hopelessness. Like Corregidora, Eva's Man relies on minimalist dialogue and on interior monologues, but the latter play an even more important role in Jones' second novel, letting the reader see Eva Medina Canada's past and her descent into mental illness, indicated through repetition of key scenes with variations, implying that Eva's memory disintegrates. The reader encounters Eva in a prison for the criminally insane at the beginning of the story, to which she has been committed for poisoning and castrating her lover. Her flashbacks reveal a life of relentless sexual objectification by men, starting with Freddy, a neighborhood boy who wants to play doctor, to Tyrone, her mother's lover who molests her, to her cousin, who propositions her. The men she encounters regard her as sexual property and react with violence if she rejects their approaches. Davis, the lover she kills, epitomizes this tendency by imprisoning her in a room to which he only comes to sleep with her. By killing him, she rebels against male tyranny, but her descent into insanity indicates that she is unable to construct a new role for herself. White Rat The stories in Jones' short story collection White Rat (1977), written between 1970 and 1977, deal largely with the same themes as her novels- communication or the lack of it, insanity, and difficult relationships. Song for Anninho (1981), a long narrative poem, covers new ground. Situated in 17th-century Brazil, the poem tells the story of Almeyda, the narrator, and her husband Anninho, who are residents of Palmares, a historical settlement by fugitive slaves, when it is overrun by Portuguese soldiers, separating husband and wife. Though Almeyda can only find her husband through memory and through art once they are separated, the poem focuses on desire as a positive theme, and it shows the possibility of love.

The statement was printed as a full-page ad in The New York Times and released to the public through the Economic Policy Institute. According to the statement, the 450 plus economists who signed the statement believe that the 2003 Bush tax cuts will increase inequality and the budget deficit, decreasing the ability of the U.S. government to fund essential services, while failing to produce economic growth.Economist's Statement Opposing the Bush Tax Cuts-EPI-Retrieved 7 Jan 2010 In rebuttal, 250 plus economists who supported the tax plan wrote that the new plan would \\"create more employment, economic growth, and opportunities for all Americans.\\" Content The statement reads as follows: > Economic growth, though positive, has not been sufficient to generate jobs > and prevent unemployment from rising.

The town was a stop on the Fredericksburg-Blanco stage route and in 1967 became a stop on the President's Ranch Trail. In late October 2007, the town was put up for sale on the auction website eBay. Early history On December 15, 1847, a petition was submitted to create Gillespie County. In 1848, the legislature formed Gillespie County from Bexar and Travis counties. While the signers were overwhelmingly German immigrants, names also on the petition were Castillo, Pena, Munos, and a handful of non-German Anglo names. The first white settlers were George Cauley, Ben White, Sr., and a man named Jacobs. Around 1877, blacksmith Fritz Wilke, George Maenius, and John Petri moved from Fredericksburg seeking pasture for their cattle. Wilke bought land from a man named Elmeier, who was robbed and murdered years later. The Martinsburg post office operated from 1877 to 1886. In 1892, Martinsburg got a new post office and a new name, after Albert Luckenbach sold his store in Luckenbach, and arrived to register a new post office in town, under the name Albert. A school was established in 1891, and in 1897 postmaster Otto Schumann opened the town's first store. In 1900 a new school building was erected; 36th President of the United States Lyndon Baines Johnson was briefly enrolled there as a boy. A local Lutheran mission, the Lutheran Church of Stonewall, was established in 1902 which Johnson attended. __________ Albert, originally known as Martinsburg, was founded in the late 1870s by settlers from Fredericksburg, TX. The town was renamed May 24, 1892 when Wilhelmina Sophie ‚ÄúMinnie‚Äù Luckenbach opened a post office that she named for her husband, Carl Albert Luckenbach. Population decline Albert had 50 residents in 1925, only 4 in 1964, and 25 in 1972. By 1985 the store had been torn down, the school converted into a community club, and the dance hall a storage locker, though Albert still had 25 residents and two businesses. The population would stay at 25 through 2000, but by 2007, the town had been all but abandoned. Since 2004 In 2004, Bobby Cave, at the time an insurance broker, bought Albert--more specifically, property on Ranch Road 1623 between Stonewall and BlancoHistoric Texas Town for Sale Albert TX on eBay-- for $216,000.Owner lists small Hill Country town for sale, a June 2007 article from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram Cave then built a tavern (in a style area locals call an icehouse) on the site of the town's former general store; after investing nearly half a million dollars, in 2007 he put it up for sale on eBay with a reserve price of $2.5 million.

He was born in Siena. He became a pupil of Alessandro Casolani, and then of Rutilio Manetti, and between the years 1622 and 1637 was active in both at Rome and at Siena. Among his etchings are a Portrait of Alessandro Casolani, a St. Anthony of Padua (1637), a Marriage of St. Catharine after Correggio, a nocturnal Repose in Egypt after Rutilio Manetti, a Lot and his Daughters after Manetti. He also made a Ceres drinking in the Cottage of the old and a set of twelve plates of the Life of St. Bernard of Siena. He also etched a set of friezes and basso- relievi, among them, the Aldobrandini Marriage from an antique painting. Capitelli overcame his shortcomings as a draughtsman and achieved the unique position of virtually the only tenebrist etcher in Italy. The use of abrupt contrasts of light and dark is characteristic of Capitelli's work.

It was developed for Sun Remarketing of Cache Valley, Utah, under license from Apple Inc., by a contract developer named Chuck Lukaszewski, who was responsible for versions up through 1.1(h), which supported up to Macintosh System 6.0.3. Dafax Processing Corp. with the assistance of Query Engineering, Inc. then further developed the environment to MacWorks Plus II, which continued Macintosh system support up to System 6.0.8 with the Basic version, and introduced a Pro version to extend support to the maximum possible for any 68000 processor: System 7.5.5. Prior to MacWorks Plus, the maximum system supported by its predecessor MacWorks XL was System 3.2. History The design objective for MacWorks Plus was 100% compatibility with software that ran on the Macintosh Plus, which at the time was Apple's flagship product. This was a technically challenging goal because other than sharing the same Motorola 68000 processor, the underlying hardware architectures of the two systems were radically different. In order to understand how MacWorks Plus worked, it is easiest to divide the discussion into three areas: hardware interface, memory model and bootstrap protocol. These were the hardware-dependent aspects of the classic Mac OS at the time. The simplest method of transporting the Mac OS to another machine was to emulate them completely. Once achieved, the much larger hardware-independent code in the 128K ROM could execute with no modification. This is what was done with MacWorks Plus. The goal was made possible by the existence of a hardware abstraction layer in the Macintosh Toolbox in the original Macintosh ROM, and a hardware Memory Management Unit (MMU) in the Lisa. Through a complete package of device drivers that fully implemented the Macintosh Toolbox Application Programming Interface (APIs), MacWorks Plus essentially tricked the 128K ROM code into thinking it was running on an actual Macintosh. It was also necessary to completely simulate the memory address space of a Macintosh Plus, including the behavior of certain illegal addresses that were deliberately exploited by certain applications (primarily games). Fortunately, while the Macintosh memory manager circuitry was not programmable, the Lisa featured a fully programmable hardware MMU which was a legacy of the minicomputer roots of its designers. Finally, bootloaders were written for all available floppy disk and hard disk models that were compatible with the Lisa. MacWorks Plus consisted of some 23,000 lines of source code for the Lisa- dependent hardware interface and bootstrap code, plus an image of the 128K ROM that was licensed from Apple. It also included a standalone installer and a Control Panel that enabled a user to adjust certain Lisa specific features from inside the Mac OS user interface.

The National Multicultural Festival is a free community festival held annually each February in Canberra. The first festival celebrating cultural diversity was held in 1981 as a one-day event on Australia Day hosted by the ACT Ethnic Communities Council. In 1996 the National Multicultural Festival in Canberra officially came into being. It began as a nod to the Capital's expanding cityscape, populated by young families with links across the globe, and blossomed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s to an event reflecting the more than 170 unique nationalities that comprise our population. The festival has become one of the most successful multicultural festivals in Australia. The festival is held over three days during February each year. The Festival is supported by the ACT Government and is administered by the Community Participation Group, Multicultural Affairs, a division of the ACT Government Community Services Directorate. History In 1981, the ACT Ethnic Communities Council held the first festival celebrating cultural diversity, a one-day event in Civic to celebrate Australia Day. By 1988, the festival had grown to host about 40 international food stalls, music and dancing. That year it was held in the Civic end of Ainslie Avenue, and along London Circuit in front of Civic Square, and also included a parade led by Chinese lion dancers. In 1997, the newly established ACT Office of Multicultural Affairs staged the first week-long Festival as a means of celebrating Canberra and Australia's cultural diversity. In 2010, the Festival became a three-day event and remains that duration. In 2012, the festival hosted a record 350 stalls. The 2012 festival was also the first to allow cultural kava use, as a trial. The ACT Government announced in 2013 that the kava trial had been a success and there would be a permanent lifting of the ban on the drink at the National Multicultural Festival. The Out In Canberra People's Choice Awards in 2013 named the National Multicultural Festival Favourite Attraction and Event. Weather at the festival is usually hot and dry, with organisers handing out 18,000 bottles of water to patrons at the 2014 festival. The festival has grown over time to become one of the most successful multicultural festivals in Australia. The 2014 event reportedly injected $5 million into the ACT economy and contributed to an additional 10,000 overnight stays in Canberra by interstate and international visitors. Fringe Festival Between 2004 and 2009, the Fringe Festival was a free event forming part of the Multicultural Festival. In 2009, then Minister for Multicultural Affairs John Hargreaves announced that the Multicultural Festival would be reduced to a three-day event and the Fringe Festival moved to become a part of the National Folk Festival. The 2013 National Multicultural Festival was the first to take place in conjunction with a fringe festival since 2009. The 2013 Fringe ran for just one night; its budget was allocated from ACT Government arts funding on a competitive basis. In 2014 the Fringe Festival continued; that year, the Fringe Festival was directed by Jorian Gardner, who the ACT Arts and Multicultural Affairs Minister Joy Burch selected for the position without a competitive selection process. Jorian Gardner hosted, among other performances, a Hitler-themed burlesque strip-tease featuring a female dancer dressed as Hitler with gold wings performing to the song Gangnam Style. The performance attracted significant controversy, with ACT Opposition Leader Jeremy Hanson calling for Arts and Multicultural Minister Joy Burch to resign or be sacked for hiring the man who oversaw the performance, and opposition multicultural affairs spokesperson Giulia Jones labeling the performance offensive and racist.

A Thompson, \\"The Barbarian Kingdoms in Gaul and Spain\\", Nottingham Mediaeval Studies, 7 (1963:4n11), the others were (i) Victoriacum, founded by Leovigild and may survive as the city of Vitoria, but a twelfth-century foundation for this city is given in contemporary sources, (ii) Lugo id est Luceo in the Asturias, referred to by Isidore of Seville, and (iii) Ologicus (perhaps Ologitis), founded using Basque labour in 621 by Suinthila as a fortification against the Basques, is modern Olite. All of these cities were founded for military purposes and at least Reccopolis, Victoriacum, and Ologicus in celebration of victory. A possible fifth Visigothic foundation is Baiyara (perhaps modern Montoro), mentioned as founded by Reccared in the fifteenth-century geographical account, Kitab al- Rawd al-Mitar, cf. Jos√© Mar√≠a Lacarra, \\"Panorama de la historia urbana en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica desde el siglo V al X,\\" La citt√† nell'alto medioevo, 6 (1958:319‚Äì358). Reprinted in Estudios de alta edad media espa√±ola (Valencia: 1975), pp25‚Äì90. It is one of the only cities in Western Europe known to have been founded between the fifth and eighth centuries. Historical information Reccopolis was founded in the year 578. The date is given in chronicle of John of Biclaro: > Luivigildus rex extinctis undique tyrannis, et pervasoribus Hispaniae > superatis sortitus requiem propiam cum plebe resedit civitatem in Celtiberia > ex nomine filii condidit, quae Recopolis nuncupatur: quam miro opere et in > moenibus et suburbanis adornans privilegia populo novae Urbis instituit. A cache of coins was discovered in the city's palace, fixing the date of construction between 580‚Äì83. Coin variety indicated cultural reach, with gold coins of the Merovingian series, Suevic coins from Galicia and of Justinian II, as well as from Visigothic Hispania itself.Welles 1948:266. Reccopolis had an active mint, coins from which have been found dating to the reign of Wittiza, in the early eighth century.E. A. Thompson, The Goths in Spain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969:64). The city was named by the Visigothic king Liuvigild to honor his son Reccared I and to serve as Reccared's seat as co- king in the Visigothic province of Celtiberia, to the west of Carpetania, where the main capital, Toledo, lay. As a post-Roman royal foundation the city's only European rival in the sixth century was Ravenna. In the eighth century the Visigoths at Reccopolis welcomed Muslim over-lordship in return for Muslim protection. The Moors conserved the city as Madin√§t Raqquba and though they reused building materials to construct a fortification on a hill facing the city, the city declined and was burned, looted, razed, and incrementally abandoned in the tenth century. It lay forgotten until the twentieth century.The first professional exploration of the site was undertaken under the supervision of J. Cabr√© in 1944‚Äì45.

Its urban core was centered on a palace with administrative as well as royal functions, connected with a palatine chapel, an arrangement that has Byzantine parallels. On the western wall, a single entrance gate provided access. Within this a second gate formed an entrance to an \\"upper city\\" of the palace compound and its attached chapel. The \\"lower city\\" outside contained lodgings for the ordinary citizens, commercial districts and a barracks. The palace was two stories tall. The lower story was a single space, perhaps a granary, with column bases supporting the story above. Flooring remnants indicate the second story may have been the piano nobile. The roofs were tiled, as they had been in Roman times. The palace chapel is possibly the last of the Visigothic Arian churches, but it was overlaid by the Romanesque hermitage of Nuestra Se√±ora de Recatel, which was constructed on the ruined site. It was of basilica construction, with a central nave separated by solid walls from the flanking naves. These exited into the transept, but did not communicate directly with the nave. Its hemispherical apse was rectangular in outer appearance. A deep narthex was entered by a single central door.

Johann Gottlob von Quandt (9 April 1787 - 19 June 1859) was a German artist, art scholar, and collector. Von Quandt was born in Leipzig. He had met and corresponded with Goethe. Some of his own works are exhibited in the Tower of Fresken at the town of D√ºrrr√∂hrsdorf-Dittersbach, near Dresden. He died in Dresden. Gottlob von Quandt never received any formal education. He did, however, study under people like Johann Friedrich Rochlitz, C. de Renty, and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Gottlob von Quandt once rescued eleven pictures of Leipzig's Nicolai Church, some of which were the creations of Lucas Cranach the Elder. This notable act earned him the respect of Goethe. The rescue work also served as the stepping stone for him into a career of art historian and collector of old German paintings. He earned a high standing in the art world of his time, and his home in Rome was a meeting place for artists such as Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Louise Seidler, and Bertel Thorvaldsen. Later, he left Rome for Dresden, where he spent the last part of his life. There, he turned his house into a kind of museum and a learning center for artists where they could work and study. The house also became a center from which von Quandt started his campaign for the promotion of the art of the Nazarenes. He contributed immensely toward this end, taking the Nazarenes art to the general public, increasing recognition of the work. As an art collector, von Quandt differed from other collectors in that he always allowed artists to choose their own subjects. He was a savior for the poor, as besides promoting art, he helped many youth from rural backgrounds to pursue studies.

The diocese comprises the department of Puy-de-D√¥me, in the Region of Auvergne. The Archbishop's seat is Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral. Throughout its history Clermont was the senior suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bourges. It became a metropolitan see itself, however, in 2002. The current Archbishop is Fran√ßois Kalist. At first very extensive, the diocese lost Haute-Auvergne in 1317 through the reorganization of the structure of bishoprics in southern France and Aquitaine by Pope John XXII, resulting in the creation of the diocese of Saint-Flour.Saint-Flour (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] In 1822, in the reorganization of French dioceses by Pope Pius VII, following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the diocese of Clermont lost the Bourbonnais, on account of the erection of the diocese of Moulins. Since the reorganization in 2002 by Pope John Paul II, there are now four dioceses in the Province of Clermont: Clermont, Le Puy-en- Velay, Moulins, and Saint-Flour. History The first Bishop of Clermont was Saint Austremonius (Stramonius). According to local tradition he was one of the seventy-two Disciples of Christ, by birth a Jew, who came with Saint Peter from Palestine to Rome and subsequently became the Apostle of Auvergne, Berry, Nivernais, and Limousin. At Clermont he is said to have converted the senator Cassius and the pagan priest Victorinus, to have sent Saint Sirenatus (Cerneuf) to Thiers, Saint Marius to Salers, Saint Nectarius (Nectaire) and Saint Antoninus into other parts of Auvergne, and to have been beheaded in 92. This tradition is based on a life of Saint Anstremonius written in the tenth century in the Mozac Abbey, where the body of the saint had rested from 761, and rewritten by the monks of Issoire, who retained the saint's head. Gregory of Tours, born in Auvergne in 544 and well versed in the history of that country, looks upon Austremonius as one of the seven envoys who, about 250, evangelized Gaul; he relates how the body of the saint was first interred at Issoire, being there the object of great veneration. Cf. (polemical, defensive of hagiographical tradition). Among the Bishops of Clermont should also be mentioned: Pierre de Cros (1301‚Äì04), engaged by Thomas Aquinas to complete his Summa; √âtienne Aubert (1340‚Äì42), later Pope Innocent VI (1352‚Äì62); Guillaume du Prat (1528‚Äì60), founder of the Clermont College in Paris, and delegate of Francis I of France to the Council of Trent; and Massillon, the illustrious orator (1717‚Äì42). Several famous Jansenists were natives of Clermont: Blaise Pascal, author of the Pens√©es (1623‚Äì62); the Arnauld family, and Jean Soanen (1647‚Äì1740), Bishop of Senez, famous for his stubborn opposition to the Bull \\"Unigenitus\\". On the other hand, the city of Riom in the diocese of Clermont was the birthplace of Jacques Sirmond, the learned Jesuit (1559‚Äì1651), Confessor to Louis XIII and editor of the volumes on the ancient councils of Gaul. Other natives worth mention were the Abb√© Jacques Delille, poet and Academician (1738‚Äì1813); and Fran√ßois Dominique de Reynaud, Comte de Montlosier, the publicist (1755‚Äì1838), who was a member of the Estates General of 1789 for Clermont-Ferrand and a Royalist in the Convention, famous for his memoir against the Jesuits and for his being refused a Catholic burial by Bishop Ferou. The famous Jesuit paleontologist and philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881-1955) was born only seven miles from Clermont, in the Ch√¢teau d'Orcines; his publications were condemned by the Roman Catholic Church.Dietrich von Hildebrand, Teilhard de Chardin: A False Prophet (Franciscan Herald Press 1970). Undoubtedly, and by far, the most famous native sons of the diocese of Clermont were √âdouard Michelin (1859‚Äì1940) and his elder brother Andr√© Michelin (1853-1931), who perfected the pneumatic tire. =Religious Orders= The Diocese of Clermont can likewise claim a number of monks whom the Church honours as saints, viz: St. Calevisus (Calais, 460‚Äì541), a pupil in the monastery of Menat near Riom, whence he retired to Maine, where he founded the Abbey of Anisole; St. Maztius (died 527), founder at Royat near Clermont of a monastery which became later a Benedictine priory; St. Portianus (sixth century), founder of a monastery to which the city of Saint-Pour√ßain (Allier) owes its origin; St. √âtienne de Muret (1046‚Äì1124), son of the Viscount of Thiers and founder of the Order of Grandmont in Limousin, and St. Peter the Venerable (1092‚Äì1156), of the Montboissier family of Auvergue, noted as a writer and Abbot of Cluny. In the diocese of Clermont, the King of France enjoyed the right of nomination of the head of numerous houses. On each of the abbeys see: These included the Benedictine abbeys of Saint-Austremoine d'Issiore,Gallia christiana II, pp. 357-360. Ebrulles,Gallia christiana II, pp. 369-372.

Cistercian abbeys included: Bellaigue, Bouchet (Vau-Luisant), Mont-Peyroux, and Val-honneste. The king nominated the Abbot of the Augustinian house at Chantoin, as well as the Premonstratensian Abbots of Saint-Andr√©-lez-Clermont, Saint-Gilbert-de- Neuf-fontaines, and the abbeys of Beaumont, La Boissie, Cessac, and L'Eschelle. Priories which were royal benefices were: Bragat, Cusset, Theulle (Ordre de Grammont), and Sallignac. He also held the nomination of the Collegiate Churches of Arthonne (the Abbot), Verneul (the Dean, Chanter, and five prebends), and the Dean of Saint-Amable de Rion. Other abbeys in the diocese included Saint-Pour√ßain, between Clermont and Moulins.Gallia christiana II, pp. 371-374. The mendicant orders began to appear in the diocese of Clermont at an early date. The Franciscans were installed in Montferrand around 1224, and shortly thereafter at Le Puy. The Dominicans were in evidence in Clermont itself by 1227 and the Franciscans in 1241. The Dominicans also settled in Aurillac ca 1230, at Riom (1233) and at Brioude (ca. 1240-1244). Clermont also had houses of Clarisses and Carmelites. The Augustinians settled at Ennezat in 1352 and the Carmelites at Aurillac in 1358. The Dominicans opened a convent at Saint-Flour before 1367. The Celestines took up residence in Vichy in 1410. The reformed Franciscans appeared in the fifteenth century, and the observant Franciscans in 1430 at Murat.Martin (ed.), p. 443. Gallia christiana II, pp. 223-224; 322-324. The Jesuits established themselves in Clermont with the College de Clermont in 1630, after a stormy beginning in which the municipality attempted to bring the College under its control. The institution grew in numbers and prestige until 1762, when an ordinance of the Parlement of Paris of 27 February forbade the municipal officers of Clermont from choosing the masters and regents of the College from among the Jesuits. The Jesuits left Clermont in March, and the Society of Jesus was completely suppressed in France in 1764. Thereafter the College was administered by a committee, authorized by a royal order, of which the Bishop was the chair. In 1791 the College became an 'Institut' administered by the Directorate of the D√©partement, and in 1796 it became the √âcole centrale du d√©partement de Puy-de-D√¥me and was administered by the municipal committee on public instruction.Tardieu, p. 616-620. The Jesuits also had colleges at Billom and Mauriac.Poitrineau, pp. 88-89. Other religious orders suffered in the Revolution. All monastic vows were abolished by the Constituent Assembly in the Autumn of 1789, and on 10 October 1789 all the properties and lands of the Church were confiscated for the benefit of the people. On 13 February 1790 all religious orders in France were dissolved. =Councils and Papal Visits= Church councils took place at Clermont in 535, 549,Hefele, IV, p. 371. J.D. Mansi, Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus IX (Florence 1763), pp. 141-146. It is interesting that no bishop of Auvergne (Clermont) subscribes, though Bishop Gallus was present at the Council of Orleans earlier in the same year. ca. 585‚Äì588,The Council of 585/588 was a provincial synod, presided over by the Archbishop of Bourges: Mansi, IX (Florence 1763), 973-974. 590,The council in confinio trium civitatum (Arverni, Gabalitani, Rutheni; Clermont, Mende, Rodez): Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum Book X, chapter 8.

The Council of 535 met under the presidency of Bishop Honoratus of Bourges and ratified at least fifteen canons, including one (¬ß2) that ordered that bishops be elected by the clergy and people, with the consent of the Metropolitan; and one (¬ß8) that forbade that Jews be appointed judges over Christians. Canon 6 prohibited sexual relations between a Christian and a Jew.Hefele, p. 191. De Clercq, pp. 106-107. The Council of 590 met at the southern border of the diocese of Clermont, where it touches the dioceses of Mende and Rodez. The bishops at the meeting, including perhaps Avitus of Clermont and Innocentius of Rodez attempted to deal with the complicated business of Tetradia, the widow of one Desiderius, and her dealings with Count Eulalius.Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum Book X, chapter 8. Duchesne, pp. 36, 40, 55. Pope Urban II came to Clermont in mid- November 1095P. Jaff√©, Regesta pontificum Romanorum, I, editio altera (Leipzig 1885), p. 681-682.

It was also at Clermont that, in 1262, in presence of St. Louis, the marriage of Philip the Bold and Isabella of Aragon was solemnized.Claude Fleury, Historia ecclesiastica (ed. B. Parode and D. Ziegler) Tomus XXI (Augsburg 1765), pp. 405-406. =Cathedral= Saint Austremonius The earliest cathedral in Clermont is naturally attributed to Saint Austremonius, the first bishop, and would therefore be a work of the third century; this is hardly likely, since Christianity was still an illegal cult, nor is it likely that it was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, given that the second cathedral had a different dedication. The second building is attributed to Bishop Namatius, in the mid-fifth century, and took twelve years to construct. It was dedicated to SS. Vitalis and Agricola.Tardieu, p. 216. This building is described by Gregory of Tours in glowing terms.Gregory of Tours, Historia Francorum, Book II, chapter 16. It was 150 feet long, 60 feet wide, and 50 feet high; it had 42 windows and eight entries. It was decorated with mosaics. The first stone for the third cathedral was laid in 937, and it was dedicated by Bishop Stephanus (II) nine years later. It was dedicated to the Virgin, SS. Vitalis and Agricola, S. Croix, S. Gervais, S. John the Baptist, S. Julian the Martyr, and the Holy Angel.Tardieu, p. 217. The fourth and current cathedral was founded in 1248 by Bishop Hugues de la Tour, who laid the first stone before his departure for Crusade. The cathedral was finally consecrated in 1341, though it was still uncompleted.Tardieu, p. 218. The Cathedral Chapter of Clermont had three dignities (the Provost,List of Provosts of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 250-251. the Abbot,List of the Abbots of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 251-253. and the DeanList of the Deans of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 253-254.); there were thirty-five Canons,List of Canons of Clermont: Tardieu, pp. 256-264. all of which were filled by vote of the Chapter.Gallia christiana IX, p. 223. Privileges of the Cathedral Chapter: Tardieu, pp. 265-270. The Chapter was suppressed by the Constitutional government in 1793. It was reestablished in accordance with the Concordat of 1801 by Bishop Du Valk de Dampierre in April 1803, with only one dignity, the Grand Chantre, and ten canons.Tardieu, p. 275. The Grand Seminaire de Clermont was the idea of Bishop Louis d'Estaing (1650-1664), whose principal concern was the improvement of the condition of the clergy of his diocese. In 1653 the bishop entered into an agreement with the Abbey of Saint-Alyre for the conversion of an unused priory in Clermont for his seminary, in exchange for a tax abatement. The project won the approval of the government of Louis XIV in a royal edict of 1654. In 1775 the Grand Seminary was transferred to larger quarters, and its quarters handed over to the Petit Seminaire which had been founded in 1712. Both were closed by order of the Revolutionary government and the buildings were sold on 11 February 1791 and turned into a barracks. The Grand Seminary was reconstituted by Bishop Du Valk de Dampierre in 1804 at Montferrand, along with the Minor Seminary.Tardieu, pp. 627-630. In 1980 the Grand Seminaire de Clermont was forced to close its doors, due to the small number of ordinands. Students for the priesthood from the diocese now attend the S√©minaire Saint-Ir√©n√©e de Francheville, near Lyon.Martin, p. 435. Bishops =To 1000= *Saint AustremoineB.

Bonitus became bishop of Auvergne on the death of his brother Avitus, in an election of questionable canonical validity, though he was confirmed by Pepin of Herstal (679‚Äì695). After ten years as bishop he retired to the monastery of Manglieu, later making a pilgrimage to Rome. He died at Lyon, where he had been resident for some four years, ca. 707.

The war consisted of a series of military conflicts between different governmental, political and military forces. Belligerents included Ukrainian nationalists, anarchists, Bolsheviks, the forces of Germany and Austria-Hungary, the White Russian Volunteer Army, and Second Polish Republic forces. They struggled for control of Ukraine after the February Revolution (March 1917) in the Russian Empire. The Allied forces of Romania and France also became involved. The struggle lasted from February 1917 to November 1921 and resulted in the division of Ukraine between the Bolshevik Ukrainian SSR, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. The conflict is frequently viewed within the framework of the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War of 1917‚Äì1922, as well as the closing stage of the Eastern Front of the First World War of 1914‚Äì1918. Background During the First World War Ukraine was in the front lines of the main combatants: the Entente-allied Russian Empire and Romania, and the Central Powers of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. By the start of 1917 ‚Äì after the Brusilov Offensive ‚Äì the Imperial Russian Army held a front line which partially reclaimed Volhynia and eastern Galicia. The February Revolution of 1917 encouraged many ethnic groups in the Russian Empire to demand greater autonomy and various degrees of self-determination. A month later, the Ukrainian People's Republic was declared in Kiev as an autonomous entity with close ties to the Russian Provisional Government, and governed by a socialist- dominated Tsentralna Rada (\\"Central Council\\"). The weak and ineffective Provisional Government in Petrograd continued its loyalty to the Entente and the increasingly unpopular war, launching the Kerensky Offensive in the summer of 1917. This offensive was a complete disaster for the Imperial Russian Army. The German counter-attack caused Russia to lose all their gains of 1916 and ruined the morale of its army, which caused the near-complete disintegration of the armed forces and the governing apparatus all over the vast Russian Empire. Many deserting soldiers and officers ‚Äì particularly ethnic Ukrainians ‚Äì had lost faith in the future of the Empire, and found the increasingly self- determinant Central Rada a much more favorable alternative. Nestor Makhno began his anarchist activity in the south of Ukraine by disarming deserting Russian soldiers and officers who crossed the Haychur River next to Huliaipole, while in the east in the industrial Donets Basin there were frequent strikes by Bolshevik-infiltrated trade unions. Eastern Front of World War I in 1917  Ukraine after the Russian revolution  All this led to the October Revolution in Petrograd, which quickly spread all over the empire. The Kiev Uprising in November 1917 led to the defeat of Russian imperial forces in the capital. Soon after, the Central Rada took power in Kiev, while in late December 1917 the Bolsheviks set up a rival Ukrainian republic in the eastern city of Kharkov () ‚Äì initially also called the \\"Ukrainian People's Republic\\".Ukrainian (Soviet) People's Republic at WMS Hostilities against the Central Rada government in Kiev began immediately. Under these circumstances, the Rada declared Ukrainian independence on January 22, 1918 and broke ties with Russia. As in the case of the Baltic countries, Ukraine's independence wasn't recognized by Russia's new Soviet government. The Rada had a limited armed force at its disposal (the Ukrainian People's Army) and was hard-pressed by the Kharkov government which received men and resources from the Russian Soviet Republic. As a result, the Bolsheviks quickly overran Poltava, Aleksandrovsk (now Zaporizhia), and Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro) by January 1918. Across Ukraine, local Bolsheviks also formed the Odessa and Donetsk- Krivoy Rog Soviet Republics; and in the south Nestor Makhno formed the Free Territory ‚Äì an anarchist region ‚Äì then allied his forces with the Bolsheviks. Aided by the earlier Kiev Arsenal Uprising, the Red Guards entered the capital on February 9, 1918. This forced the Central Rada to evacuate to Zhytomyr. In the meantime, the Romanians took over Bessarabia. Most remaining Russian Imperial Army units either allied with the Bolsheviks or joined the Ukrainian People's Army. A notable exception was Colonel Mikhail Drozdovsky, who marched his White Volunteer Army unit across the whole of Novorossiya to the River Don, defeating Makhno's forces in the process. German intervention and Hetmanate, 1918 UNR before annexation of the Ukrainian lands in Austria- Hungary (February 1918 article from The New York Times) Europe in 1919 after the treaties of Brest Litovsk Ukraine according to an old postage stamp from 1919. Faced with imminent defeat, the Rada turned to its still hostile opponents ‚Äì the Central Powers ‚Äì for a truce and alliance, which was accepted by Germany in the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (signed on February 9, 1918) in return for desperately needed food supplies which Ukraine would provide to the Germans. The Imperial German and Austro-Hungarian armies then drove the Bolsheviks out of Ukraine, taking Kiev on March 1. Two days later, the Bolsheviks signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which formally ended hostilities on the Eastern Front of World War I and left Ukraine in a German sphere of influence. The Ukrainian People's Army took control of the Donets Basin in April 1918. 100 years ago Bakhmut and the rest of Donbass liberated, Ukrayinska Pravda (April 18, 2018) Also in April 1918 Crimea was cleared of Bolshevik forces by Ukrainian troops and the Imperial German Army.Germany Takes Control of Crimea, New York Herald (May 18, 1918) On March 13, 1918 Ukrainian troops and the Austro-Hungarian Army secured Odessa. On April 5, 1918 the German army took control of Yekaterinoslav, and 3 days later Kharkov.War Without Fronts: Atamans and Commissars in Ukraine, 1917-1919 by Mikhail Akulov, Harvard University, August 2013 (page 102 and 103) By April 1918 all Bolshevik gains in Ukraine were lost; this was due to the apathy of the locals and the then-inferior fighting skills of the Red Army compared to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts. Yet disturbances continued throughout Eastern Ukraine, where local Bolsheviks, peasant self-defense groups known as \\"green armies\\", and the anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine refused to subordinate to Germany. Former Imperial Russian Army General Pavlo Skoropadsky led a successful German-backed coup against the Rada on April 29. He proclaimed the conservative Ukrainian State (also known as the \\"Hetmanate\\") with himself as monarch, and reversed many of the socialist policies of the former government. The new government had close ties to Berlin, but Skoropadsky never declared war on any of the Triple Entente powers; Skoropadsky also placed Ukraine in a position that made it a safe haven for many upper- and middle-class people fleeing Bolshevik Russia, and was keen on recruiting many former Russian Army soldiers and officers. Despite sporadic harassment from Makhno, the territory of the Hetmanate enjoyed relative peace until November 1918; when the Central Powers were defeated on the Western Front, Germany completely withdrew from Ukraine. Skoropadsky left Kiev with the Germans, and the Hetmanate was in turn overthrown by the socialist Directorate. Resumed hostilities, 1919 Almost immediately after the defeat of Germany, Lenin's government annulled their Brest-Litovsk Treaty ‚Äì which Leon Trotsky described as \\"no war no peace\\" ‚Äì and invaded Ukraine and other countries of Eastern Europe that were formed under German protection. Simultaneously, the collapse of the Central Powers affected the former Austrian province of Galicia, which was populated by Ukrainians and Poles. The Ukrainians proclaimed a Western Ukrainian People's Republic (WUNR) in Eastern Galicia, which wished to unite with the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR); while the Poles of Eastern Galicia ‚Äì who were mainly concentrated in Lw√≥w () ‚Äì gave their allegiance to the newly formed Second Polish Republic. Both sides became increasingly hostile with each other. On January 22, 1919, the Western Ukrainian People's Republic and the Ukrainian People's Republic signed an Act of Union in Kiev. By October 1919, the Ukrainian Galician Army of the WUNR was defeated by Polish forces in the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War and Eastern Galicia was annexed to Poland; the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 granted Eastern Galicia to Poland for 25 years. The defeat of Germany had also opened the Black Sea to the Allies, and in mid-December 1918 some mixed forces under French command were landed at Odessa and Sevastopol, and months later at Kherson and Nikolayev (). The cause and purpose of French intervention was not entirely clear; French military leaders quickly became disillusioned by internal quarrels within the anti-Bolshevik forces that prevented effective collaboration against Bolshevik pressures, and they particularly criticized the White Russian Volunteer Army for its arrogance towards the local population. Strong anti-foreigner feelings among Ukrainians convinced French officers that intervention in this climate of hostility was doomed without massive support. When the French government failed to supply enough equipment and manpower for extensive military operations, the French army faced defeat at the hands of pro-Bolshevik forces and French officers counseled Paris to withdraw the expedition from Odessa and Crimea. A new, swift Bolshevik offensive overran most of Eastern and central Ukraine in early 1919. Kiev ‚Äì under the control of Symon Petliura's Directorate ‚Äì fell to the Red Army again on February 5, and the exiled Soviet Ukrainian government was re-instated as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, moving to Kiev on March 15. The Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) faced imminent defeat against the Bolsheviks ‚Äì it was reduced to a strip of land along the Polish border with its capital moving from Vinnytsia to Proskurov (now Khmelnytskyi), then to Kamianets- Podilskyi, and finally to Rivne. But the UNR was saved when the Bolshevik armies had to regroup against a renewed White Russian offensive in South Russia and the Urals, which threatened the very existence of Bolshevism ‚Äì and so required more urgent attention. During the spring and summer of 1919, Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army and Don Army overran all of central and Eastern Ukraine and made significant gains on other fronts. Yet by winter the tide of war reversed decisively, and by 1920 all of Eastern and central Ukraine except Crimea was again in Bolshevik hands. The Bolsheviks also betrayed and defeated Nestor Makhno, their former ally against Denikin. Polish involvement, 1920 Again facing imminent defeat, the UNR turned to its former adversary, Poland; and in April 1920, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and Symon Petliura signed a military agreement in Warsaw to fight the Bolsheviks. Just like the former alliance with Germany, this move partially sacrificed Ukrainian sovereignty: Petliura recognised the Polish annexation of Galicia and agreed to Ukraine's role in Pi≈Çsudski's dream of a Polish-led federation in Eastern Europe. Immediately after the alliance was signed, Polish forces joined the Ukrainian army in the Kiev Offensive to capture central and southern Ukraine from Bolshevik control. Initially successful, the offensive reached Kiev on May 7, 1920. However, the Polish-Ukrainian campaign was a pyrrhic victory: in late May, the Red Army led by Mikhail Tukhachevsky staged a large counter-offensive south of Zhytomyr which pushed the Polish army almost completely out of Ukraine, except for Lviv in Galicia. In yet another reversal, in August 1920 the Red Army was defeated near Warsaw and forced to retreat. The White forces, now under General Wrangel, took advantage of the situation and started a new offensive in southern Ukraine. Under the combined circumstances of their military defeat in Poland, the renewed White offensive, and disastrous economic conditions throughout the Russian SFSR ‚Äì these together forced the Bolsheviks to seek a truce with Poland. End of hostilities, 1921 Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace with the Poles. The Poles, exhausted and constantly pressured by the Western governments and the League of Nations, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on 21 September and the other on 28 September. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on 2 October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer, which Poland accepted. The Preliminary Treaty of Peace and Armistice Conditions between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on 12 October, and the armistice went into effect on 18 October.(in Polish) Wojna polsko-bolszewicka. Entry at Internetowa encyklopedia PWN. Retrieved 27 October 2006.Text in League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 4, pp. 8‚Äì45. Ratifications were exchanged at LiepƒÅja on 2 November 1920. Long negotiations of the final peace treaty ensued. Meanwhile, Petliura's Ukrainian forces, which now numbered 23,000 soldiers and controlled territories immediately to the east of Poland, planned an offensive in Ukraine for 11 November but were attacked by the Bolsheviks on 10 November. By 21 November, after several battles, they were driven into Polish-controlled territory.Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia, Volume I (1963). Edited by Volodymyr Kubiyovych. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp. 831‚Äì833 and pp.872‚Äì874 On March 18, 1921, Poland signed a peace treaty in Riga, Latvia with Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine. This effectively ended Poland's alliance obligations with Petliura's Ukrainian People's Republic. According to this treaty, the Bolsheviks recognized Polish control over Galicia () and western Volhynia ‚Äì the western part of Ukraine ‚Äì while Poland recognized the larger central parts of Ukrainian territory, as well as eastern and southern areas, as part of Soviet Ukraine. Having secured peace on the Western front, the Bolsheviks immediately moved to crush the remnants of the White Movement. After a final offensive on the Isthmus of Perekop, the Red Army overran Crimea. Wrangel evacuated the Volunteer Army to Constantinople in November 1920. After its military and political defeat, the Directorate continued to maintain control over some of its military forces; in October 1921, it launched a series of guerrilla raids into central Ukraine that reached as far east as the modern Kiev Oblast (\\"Kiev province\\"). On November 4, the Directorate's guerrillas captured Korosten and seized a cache of military supplies. But on November 17, 1921, this force was surrounded by Bolshevik cavalry and destroyed. Aftermath In the current Chyhyryn Raion of Cherkasy Oblast (then in the Kiev Governorate), a local man named Vasyl Chuchupak led the \\"Kholodnyi Yar Republic\\" which strived for Ukrainian independence. It lasted from 1919 to 1922, making it the last territory held by armed supporters of an independent Ukrainian state before the incorporation of Ukraine into the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR. In honor of the chieftain blessed knives, Gazeta.ua (21 April 2010) Gerashchenko offers a National Park \\"Cold Yar\\", Ukrinform (19 October 2016)\\"Russian-Ukrainian war never stopped\\", Gazeta.ua (12 December 2014) In 1922, the Russian Civil War was coming to an end in the Far East, and the Communists proclaimed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) as a federation of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Transcaucasia. The Ukrainian Soviet government was nearly powerless in the face of a centralized monolith Communist Party apparatus based in Moscow. In the new state, Ukrainians initially enjoyed a titular nation position during the nativization and Ukrainization periods. However, by 1928 Joseph Stalin had consolidated power in the Soviet Union. Thus a campaign of cultural repression started, cresting in the 1930s when a massive famine ‚Äì the Holodomor ‚Äì struck the republic, claiming several millions of lives. The Polish-controlled part of Ukraine had a different fate: there was very little autonomy, both politically and culturally, but it was not affected by famine. In the late 1930s the internal borders of the Ukrainian SSR were redrawn, yet no significant changes were made. The political status of Ukraine remained unchanged until the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between the USSR and Nazi Germany in August 1939, in which the Red Army allied with Nazi Germany to invade Poland and incorporate Volhynia and Galicia into the Ukrainian SSR. In June 1941, Germany and its allies invaded the Soviet Union and conquered Ukraine completely within the first year of the conflict. Following the Soviet victory on the Eastern Front of World War II, to which Ukrainians greatly contributed, the region of Carpathian Ruthenia ‚Äì formerly a part of Hungary before 1919, of Czechoslovakia from 1919 to 1939, of Hungary between 1939 and 1944, and again of Czechoslovakia from 1944 to 1945 ‚Äì was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR, as were parts of interwar Poland. The final expansion of Ukraine took place in 1954, when the Crimea was transferred to Ukraine from Russia with the approval of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Legacy The war is portrayed in Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The White Guard. Many folk songs were written from 1918 to 1922 that were inspired by people and events of this conflict. \\"Oi u luzi chervona kalyna\\" and \\"Oi vydno selo\\" were inspired by the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen unit of the Austro-Hungarian Army, which became the core battalion of the West Ukrainian People's Republic's Ukrainian Galician Army. \\"Pisnya pro Tiutiunnyk\\" was inspired by events surrounding Ukrainian People's Army brigade commander Yuriy Tiutiunnyk. Another song written at this time was \\"Za Ukrayinu\\". These \\"war songs\\" started to be sung publicly again in the western part of the Ukrainian SSR after the introduction of glasnost (Ukrainian: hlasnist) by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and regained popularity throughout Ukraine after independence ‚Äì especially during the current Russian military intervention. Another musical legacy of this period was the Ukrainian Republic Capella (later the Ukrainian National Chorus), set up in early 1919 by the Directorate government of Symon Petliura. Under the direction of Oleksandr Koshetz, the Capella/Chorus toured Europe and North America from 1919 to 1921 and while in exile from 1922 to 1927; popularising the songs \\"Shchedryk\\" and \\"Oi khodyt son, kolo vikon\\" ‚Äì which influenced the composition of the popular English language songs \\"Carol of the Bells\\" and \\"Summertime\\", respectively. In the 21st century the Kholodnyi Yar Republic flag was seen during the Euromaidan demonstrations and was later used by the Azov Battalion in the War in Donbas.

It was produced by Gil Norton (Pixies, Echo & the Bunnymen, Foo Fighters) and written by David McComb on vocals, keyboards and guitar. The B-side \\"Time of Weakness\\" was recorded live at the Graphic Arts Club, Sydney, November 1985 by Mitch Jones, mixed by Rob Muir (in Perth). \\"Dear Miss Lonely Hearts\\" was recorded at Planet Sound Studios, Perth and produced by the Triffids. \\"Wide Open Road\\" reached No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986, and No. 64 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named \\"Wide Open Road\\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \\"Ozzest 100\\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \\"Wide Open Road\\" was ranked number 64. Background The Triffids had toured Europe in 1985 and were based in London but they were unable to raise a major record deal and with a lack of finances, their second studio album Born Sandy Devotional was recorded there in August 1985 with Gil Norton producing (fresh from working with Echo & the Bunnymen). They released two versions of \\"Wide Open Road\\", a 7‚Äù version and a 12‚Äù version. The B-side, \\"Time of Weakness\\", was recorded live at the Graphic Arts Club, Sydney. The album reached No. 27 on the UK charts and the single peaked at No. 26 on the UK charts: while only reaching No. 64 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. The song was written by David McComb, who described the process: On 10 January 1987 The Triffids performed the track live at their home town, Perth's Subiaco Oval, as part of the Australian Made Tour by various artists. McComb introduced their performance: \\"... it's sorta hard to write the set list at the start of the day 'cos we've had so many hits in this country: it's difficult to know which hit to play. Where to start? But this one's been played on Countdown so I guess that means something...\\" In July that year a documentary film, Australian Made: The Movie, of the concert series, with The Triffids represented by \\"Wide Open Road\\", was released to Australian cinemas and later onto VHS (1988). The song reached No. 68 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 1989 and No. 49 in 1990 (from 1989 to 1991, voting was not restricted to songs released that year). Its success also resulted in the band's first appearance on Australia's popular weekly musical television show, Countdown. Reviews \\"Hauntingly simple in its sparse use of keyboards, clean, ringing guitars, and just the one, repeated drum fill, it has an epic majesty which is entirely suited to the semi-mythical Australia of The Triffids‚Äô vision; no other song has so perfectly captured the sense of vast, uncharted expanses which characterises the Australia of our collective imagination.\\" \\"'Wide Open Road' is one of those songs that illustrates the stark reality of Australia‚Äôs barren, desolate landscape on many levels, emphasising it's often cruel geography and the realities that come from existing within it.\\" \\"The band uses silence and space to allow the lyrics and melody to resonate fully with the listener. While the song may be Australian in setting with its evocation of a vast, desert wasteland, it uses the Australian desert as a metaphor for the distance between people and for the sense of loss following a failed relationship.\\" Legacy In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named \\"Wide Open Road\\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) Top 30 Australian songs Paul Kelly and The Saints' Chris Bailey performed \\"Wide Open Road\\" at the Mushroom 25th Anniversary concert in 1998, to ensure that one of Kelly's favourite songwriters was represented. \\"Wide Open Road\\" was re-released as a CD single by Mushroom Records in 1998 as No. 16 in a series of 25 limited edition classic Mushroom singles. It was also re-released as a download only single by Domino Records to coincide with the re-release of Born Sandy Devotional in July 2006. Cover versions of the song were also recorded by Weddings Parties Anything on their 1998 compilation album Trophy Night, and The Church on their 2007 acoustic album El Momento Siguiente. It was also covered by fellow Perth outfit The Panics for Triple J's segment, \\"Like a Version\\" in 2007.

It is one of the famous exploits of the god Vishnu. In this episode, Vishnu came down to earth to protect Gajendra, the elephant, from the clutches of a Crocodile, alternatively known as Makara or Huhu, and with Vishnu's help, Gajendra achieved moksha, or liberation from cycle of birth and death. Gajendra then attained a form like that of the god (Sarupya Mukti) and went to Vaikuntha with Vishnu. This story was narrated by Shuka to King Parikshit at Parikshit's request. Story There was once an elephant named Gajendra who lived in a garden called ·πötumat which was created by Varuna. This garden was located on Mount Trikuta, the \\"Three-Peaked Mountain.\\" Gajendra ruled over all the other elephants in the herd. One day as usual he went to the lake near by to pick lotus flowers to offer prayer to Lord Vishnu. Suddenly, a crocodile living in the lake attacked Gajendra and caught him by the leg. Gajendra tried for a long time to escape from the crocodile's clutches. All his family members, relatives and friends gathered around to help him, but in vain. The crocodile simply would not let go. When they realised that ‚Äòdeath‚Äô had come close to Gajendra, they left him alone. He trumpeted in pain and helplessness until he was hoarse. As the struggle was seemingly endless and when he had spent his last drop of energy, Gajendra called to the god Vishnu to save him, holding a lotus up in the air as an offering. Hearing his devotee's call and prayer, Vishnu rushed to the scene. As Gajendra sighted the god coming, he lifted a lotus with his trunk. Seeing this, Vishnu was pleased and with his Sudharshana Chakra, he decapitated the crocodile. Gajendra prostrated himself before the god. Vishnu informed Gajendra that he, in one of his previous births, had been the celebrated King Indradyumna, a devotee of Vishnu, but due to his disrespect to the great Sage Agastya, he had been cursed to be reborn as an elephant. Because Indradyumna had been devoted to Vishnu, the god had him born as Gajendra and made him realize that there is something called Kaivalya which is beyond Svarga and Urdhva Loka, the realm of the gods. Indradyumna could attain Moksha finally when he (as Gajendra) left all his pride and doubt and totally surrendered himself to Vishnu. The prayer made by Gajendra on this occasion became a famous hymn in praise of Vishnu called the Gajendra Stuti . > ‡§∂‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§∞‡§ß‡§∞‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§∂‡§∂‡§ø ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Ç ‡§ö‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡•Å‡§ú‡§Ç ‡•§ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§® ‡§µ‡§¶‡§®‡§Ç ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡•á‡§§ ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ > ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ò‡•ç‡§®‡•ã‡§™‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ø‡•á‡•• :≈õuklƒÅ·πÉbaradhara·πÉ vi·π£·πáu·πÉ ≈õa≈õi var·πáa·πÉ caturbhuja·πÉ  :prasanna vadana·πÉ dhyƒÅyƒìta sarva vighn≈çpa≈õƒÅntayƒì  Previous Births Gajendra Moksha print Gajendra, in his previous life, was Indradyumna, a great king who was devoted to Vishnu. One day, Agastya, a great rishi (sage) came to visit the king, but Indradyumna remained seated, refusing to rise up to receive the sage with due respect. Agastya was irate and noticed that the mighty king, despite the greatness of his good deeds, still had traces of Ahamkara, or egoism, and he revealed to the king that, in his next birth, he would be born as an elephant and in that form he would learn the hard way that the self must be renounced and surrendered to the Lord. The crocodile in its previous birth had been a Gandharva king called Huhu. The sage Devala came to visit the king, and when the two of them were bathing and Devala was offering prayers to Surya (the Sun god), the king pulled the sage's leg for fun. The sage was furious and cursed the king to become a crocodile in his next life. The repentant king begged the sage's pardon. Devala explained that he could not reverse the curse; he blessed Huhu that Vishnu would slay the crocodile and liberate him from the cycle of birth and death. Symbolic Meaning The tale of Gajendra is an integral theme in Vaishnavism and has great symbolic value: Gajendra is the man, the crocodile is sin, and the muddy water of the lake is Sa·πÉsƒÅra. The symbolic meaning of Gajendra moksha is that materialistic desires, ignorance and sins create an endless chain of karma in this world and are similar to a crocodile preying upon a helpless elephant stuck in a muddy pond. Humans are thus stuck in a continuous cycle of death and rebirth until the day when they can look beyond everything in this creation and ultimately submit themselves to the supreme being Vishnu.

Written and directed by Rick Sloane, the film was released on DVD by Shout! Factory on June 23, 2009. The sequel was made to look identical to the original film, and utilized 35mm film and composite effects, look-alike actors, some of the original costumes and the same puppets. Plot The film takes place after the original film, where McCreedy has been locked in a psychiatric hospital after blowing up the film studio to destroy the Hobgoblins, which occurred at the end of the first film. Kevin and his friends are now in college, and their Professor introduces them to McCreedy, who warns them that it is still possible to be attacked by Hobgoblins. Despite McCreedy's warning, Kevin and his friends re-encounter the Hobgoblins and must fight against them and their own greatest fears, in order to save their lives. Cast Development Made on a minuscule budget, the film is full of in- jokes and low-budget special effects, just like the original. The characters still dress like in the 1980s. Fantazia now does Internet sex, instead of phone sex with Kyle, Nick has been dishonorably discharged from the United States Army, Daphne is still promiscuous, and Kevin is still henpecked by his frigid girlfriend Amy. Hobgoblins 2 also delivers even more stock shots of explosions and car crashes than the original. A DVD bonus feature, \\"Hobgoblins 2, What Were They Thinking?\\", features the original Hobgoblins cast critiquing the new actors who re-created their roles. Director Rick Sloane discusses how this film was originally planned to go into production two years after the original, and instead, 20 years later, it was shot using the same script. Nonetheless, the film does include occasional sly references to the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode, in which the original film was spoofed (after it was submitted to the MST3K team by Sloane himself) ‚Äì in particular, the theme song for Hobgoblins 2 is based on a song that Mike and the Bots sing in the MST3K episode.

It is a violent, gore-filled tale.  Premise  Michael Conrad is a private zookeeper who owns Conrad's Animal Kingdom. He leads a cult group who literally worship the animals he tends ‚Äî especially the big cats: a lion, a lioness, a pair of cheetahs, a tiger, and a black panther; as well as a gorilla. Conrad plays organ music to the animals in his living room, and uses them to kill anyone who gets in his way. Conrad is married to Edna and forces his mute son Carl to assist him.  Cast   Production  Herman Cohen had the idea for the film, and hired Aben Kandel to work with him on the script. Cohen had worked with Gough previously in Horrors of the Black Museum and Konga. The animals were provided by Ralph Helfer. The zoo was built at Raleigh Studio (formerly Producers Studio) on North Bronson in Hollywood, California. The entire zoo seen in the picture was an interior set. Tom Weaver, Attack of the Monster Movie Makers (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Co. 1994, , ) Publicity was done with the cats‚Äîincluding an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

He had been Vicar-General of the diocese of Agen and Director of the Carmelite Nuns in France when he was made Bishop of Clermont, in 1776. On the eve of the French Revolution, as he was warning his diocesans against the license of the press, he predicted that visitations of God were coming. He went as one of the deputies of the clergy to the Estates- General of 1789. To Target, who spoke of the \\"God of peace,\\" he replied that the God of peace was also the God of order and justice. From his prison Louis XVI sent for his opinion as to whether he should receive Paschal Communion. In reply, he was sympathetic, but advised the monarch to abstain \\"for having sanctioned decrees destructive of religion\\". Bonal was alluding chiefly to the civil constitution of the clergy. Having declined to take the loyalty oath to the constitution, he was compelled to leave his diocese and country. He passed to Flanders and later to Holland, was captured and sentenced to deportation by the French, but succeeded in making his escape and spent the last years of his life in various cities of Germany. He was the author of a Testament spirituel.

Nude photography is undertaken for a variety of purposes, including educational uses, commercial applications and artistic creations. The exhibition or publication of nude photographs may be controversial, more so in some cultures or countries than in others, and especially if the subject is a minor. Educational Nude photographs may be used for scientific and educational purpose, such as ethnographic studies, human physiology or sex education. In this context, the emphasis of the photograph is not on the subject, or the beauty or eroticism of the image, but on the educational or demonstrative purpose for which the image was produced. The nude image may be used for analysis or to accompany medical or other text books, scientific reports, articles or research papers. They are essentially of an illustrative nature, and so nude photographs of this type are often labeled to show key features in a supporting context. Commercial =Erotic= Since the first days of photography, the nude was a source of inspiration for those that adopted the new medium. Most of the early images were closely guarded or surreptitiously circulated as violations of the social norms of the time, since the photograph captures real nudity. Many cultures, while accepting nudity in art, shun actual nudity. For example, even an art gallery which exhibits nude paintings will typically not accept nudity in a visitor. Alfred Cheney Johnston (1885‚Äì1971) was a professional American photographer who often photographed Ziegfeld Follies. He also maintained his own highly successful commercial photo studio, producing magazine ads for a wide range of upscale retail commercial products‚Äîmostly men's and women's fashions‚Äîand also photographed several hundred artists and showgirls, including nude photographs of some. Most of his nude images (some named, mostly anonymous) were, in fact, showgirls from the Ziegfeld Follies, but such daring, unretouched full-frontal images would certainly not have been openly publishable in the 1920s‚Äì1930s, so it is speculated that these were either simply his own personal artistic work, and/or done at the behest of Flo Ziegfeld for the showman's personal enjoyment.

The subject may be fully clothed or semi-nude, but glamour photography stops short of intentionally sexually arousing the viewer and being pornographic. Before about the 1960s, glamour photography was commonly referred to as erotic photography. =Advertising= Nudity and sexually suggestive imagery is common in modern-day culture and widely used in advertising to help sell products. A feature of this form of advertising is that the imagery used typically has no connection to the product being advertised. The purpose of such imagery is to attract the attention of a potential customer or user. The imagery used may include nudity, actual or suggestive, and glamour photography. =Entertainment= Nude or semi-nude imagery is also widely used in entertainment, sometimes referred to as adult entertainment. This may be in the form of postcards, pin ups, and other formats. Covers of mainstream magazines sometimes include images of nude or semi-nude subjects. In the early 1990s, Demi Moore posed for two covers of Vanity Fair: Demi's Birthday Suit and More Demi Moore. Some magazines, such as men's magazines, commonly feature nude or semi-nude images, and some magazines have created a reputation for their nude centrefolds. =Music album covers= Music album covers often incorporate photography, at times including nude or semi-nude images. Album covers that have incorporated nudity have included those of performers such as Jimi Hendrix (Electric Ladyland, 1968), John Lennon and Yoko Ono (Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins, 1968), Nirvana, Blind Faith (Blind Faith, 1969), Scorpions (Virgin Killer, 1976) and Jane's Addiction (Nothing's Shocking, 1988). The covers for Blind Faith and Virgin Killer were especially controversial because the nude images were of prepubescent girls, and were re-issued with alternative covers in some countries. Fine art The emphasis of fine arts is aesthetics and creativity; and any erotic interest, although often present, is secondary. This distinguishes nude photography from both glamour photography and pornographic photography. The distinction between these is not always clear, and photographers tends to use their own judgment in characterizing their own work, though viewers also have their judgement. The nude remains a controversial subject in all media, but more so with photography due to its inherent realism. The male nude has been less common than the female, and more rarely exhibited.

Before nude photography, art nudes usually used allusions to classical antiquity; gods and warriors, goddesses and nymphs. Poses, lighting, soft focus, vignetting and hand retouching were employed to create photographic images that were comparable to the other arts at that time. Although 19th-century artists in other media often used photographs as substitutes for live models, the best of these photographs were also intended as works of art in their own right. File:Archives d'√âros Marconi 02.jpgNude by Gaudenzio Marconi, 19th century File:Marconi, Gaudenzio (1841-1885) - Nudo accademico.jpgNude by Gaudenzio Marconi, 1841‚Äì1885 File:Frank Eugene - Adam und Eva 1898.jpgAdam and Eve by Frank Eugene, taken 1898, published in Camera Work no. 30, 1910 Modern After World War I, avant-garde photographers such as Brassa√Ø, Man Ray, Hans Bellmer, Andr√© Kert√©sz and Bill Brandt became more experimental in their portrayal of nudity, using reflective distortions and printing techniques to create abstractions or depicting real life rather than classical allusions. Alfred Stieglitz's photos of Georgia O'Keeffe are examples of some of the earliest nudes presented in an intimate and personal style rather than with dispassionate idealization. Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Ruth Bernhard, Harry Callahan, Emmet Gowin and Edward Steichen continued this trend. Weston evolved a particularly American aesthetic, using a large format camera to capture images of nature and landscapes as well as nudes, establishing photography as a fine arts medium. In 1937 Weston became the first photographer to be awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship. For a famous example of Weston's work see: Charis Wilson. Many fine art photographers have a variety of subjects in their work, the nude being one. Diane Arbus was attracted to unusual people in unusual settings, including a nudist camp. Lee Friedlander had more conventional subjects, one being Madonna as a young model. Contemporary The distinction between fine art and glamour is often one of marketing, with fine art being sold through galleries or dealers in limited editions signed by the artist, and glamour photos being distributed through mass media. For some, the difference is in the gaze of the model; glamour models look into the camera, while art models do not. Glamour and fashion photographers have aspired to fine art status in some of their work. One such photographer was Irving Penn, who progressed from Vogue magazine to photographing fashion models such as Kate Moss nude. Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton and Annie Leibovitz have followed a similar path with portraits of the famous, many of them nude or partially clothed. In the post-modern era, where fame is often the subject of fine art, Avedon's photo of Nastassja Kinski with a python, and Leibovitz's magazine covers of Demi Moore pregnant and in body paint have become iconic. The work of Joyce Tenneson has gone the other way, from fine art with a unique, soft- focus style showing women at all stages of life to portraiture of famous people and fashion photography. Although nude photographers have largely worked within established forms that show bodies as sculptural abstractions, some, such as Robert Mapplethorpe, have created works that deliberately blur the boundaries between erotica and art. Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of underage subjects. David Hamilton often used erotic themes. Sally Mann was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale where skinny-dipping in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude. Less well- known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children. Body image has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models whose bodies do not conform to conventional prejudices about beauty.

A person's chronotype is the propensity for the individual to sleep at a particular time during a 24-hour period. Eveningness (delayed sleep period) and morningness (advanced sleep period) are the two extremes with most individuals having some flexibility in the timing of their sleep period. However, across development there are changes in the propensity of the sleep period with pre-pubescent children preferring an advanced sleep period, adolescents preferring a delayed sleep period and many elderly preferring an advanced sleep period. The causes and regulation of chronotypes, including developmental change, individual propensity for a specific chronotype, and flexible versus fixed chronotypes have yet to be determined. However, research is beginning to shed light on these questions, such as the relationship between age and chronotype. There are candidate genes (called clock genes) that exist in most cells in the body and brain, referred to as the circadian system that regulate physiological phenomena (hormone levels, metabolic function, body temperature, cognitive faculties, and sleeping). With the exception of the most extreme and rigid chronotypes, regulation is likely due to gene-environment interactions. Important environmental cues (zeitgebers) include light, feeding, social behavior, and work and school schedules. Additional research has proposed an evolutionary link between chronotype and nighttime vigilance in ancestral societies. Humans are normally diurnal creatures, that is to say they are active in the daytime. As with most other diurnal animals, human activity-rest patterns are endogenously controlled by biological clocks with a circadian (~24-hour) period. Chronotypes have also been investigated in other species, such as fruit flies and mice. Normal variation in chronotype encompasses sleep‚Äìwake cycles that are two to three hours later in evening types than morning types. Extremes outside of this range can cause a person difficulty in participating in normal work, school, and social activities. If a person's \\"lark\\" or (more commonly) \\"owl\\" tendencies are strong and intractable to the point of disallowing normal participation in society, the person is considered to have a circadian rhythm sleep disorder.American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Revised Edition 2001. History The 20th century saw greatly increased interest in and research on all questions about sleep. Tremendous strides have been made in molecular, neural and medical aspects of biological rhythmicity. Physiology professor Nathaniel Kleitman's 1939 book Sleep and Wakefulness, revised 1963, summarized the existing knowledge of sleep, and it was he who proposed the existence of a basic rest-activity cycle. Kleitman, with his students including William C. Dement and Eugene Aserinsky, continued his research throughout the 1900s. O. √ñquist's 1970 thesis at the Department of Psychology, University of G√∂teborg, Sweden, marks the beginning of modern research into chronotypes, and is entitled Kartl√§ggning av individuella dygnsrytmer, or \\"Charting Individual Circadian Rhythms\\". Measurement =Morningness‚Äìeveningness questionnaire= Olov √ñstberg modified √ñquist's questionnaire and in 1976, together with J.A. (Jim) Horne, he published the 19-item morningness‚Äìeveningness questionnaire, MEQ, which is still used and referred to in virtually all research on this topic. Researchers in many countries have worked on validating the MEQ with regard to their local cultures. A revision of the scoring of the MEQ as well as a component analysis was done by Jacques Taillard et al. in 2004, working in France with employed people over the age of 50. Previously the MEQ had been validated only for subjects of university age. =Circadian Type Inventory= The Circadian Type Inventory, developed by Folkard (1987), is an improved version of the 20-item Circadian Type Questionnaire (CTQ). The CTI was initially developed to identify individuals capable of adapting to shift work. Thus, the scale assesses two factors that influence a person‚Äôs ability to alter his or her sleeping rhythms: rigidity/flexibility of sleeping habits and ability/inability to overcome drowsiness. Since its creation, the scale has undergone a number of revisions to improve its psychometric properties. An 18-item version was used as part of the larger Standard Shiftwork Index (SSI) in a study conducted by Barton and colleagues. This shorter scale was then reduced and altered to make an 11 item scale by De Milia et al.Circadian Type Inventory (CTI)  Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278651218_Circadian_Type_Inventory_CTI [accessed Sep 23 2018]. =Composite Scale of Morningness= Smith et al. (1989) analyzed items from MEQ, Diurnal Type Scale, and CTQ and chose the best ones to develop an improved instrument, the 13-item Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM or CS). CSM consists of 9 items from the MEQ and 4 items from the Diurnal Type Scale and is regarded as an improved version of MEQ. It currently exists in 14 language versions; the most recently developed are Polish, Russian and Hindi.Bhatia T, Agrawal A, Beniwal RP, Thomas P, Monk TH, Nimgaonkar VL, Deshpande SN.

Till Roenneberg's Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) from 2003 uses a quantitative approach; his many thousands of subjects have answered questions about their sleep behavior. Characteristics Most people are neither evening nor morning types but lie somewhere in between. Estimates vary, but a 2007 survey of over 55,000 people by Roenneberg et al. showed that morningness‚Äìeveningness tends to follow a normal distribution. People who share a chronotype, morningness or eveningness, have similar activity-pattern timing: sleep, appetite, exercise, study etc. Researchers in the field of chronobiology look for objective markers by which to measure the chronotype spectrum. Paine et al. conclude that \\"morningness/eveningness preference is largely independent of ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic position, indicating that it is a stable characteristic that may be better explained by endogenous factors\\". =Sleep= Horne and √ñstberg found that morning types had a higher daytime temperature with an earlier peak time than evening types and that they went to sleep and awoke earlier, but no differences in sleep lengths were found. They also note that age should be considered in assessments of morningness and eveningness, noting how a \\"bed time of 23:30 may be indicative of a morning type within a student population, but might be more related to an evening type in the 40‚Äì60 years age group\\". Clodor√© et al. found differences in alertness between morning and evening types after a two-hour sleep reduction. Duffy et al. investigated \\"changes in the phase relationship between endogenous circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle\\", and found that although evening types woke at a later clock hour than morning types, morning types woke at a later circadian phase. Zavada et al. show that the exact hour of mid-sleep on free (non-work) days may be the best marker for sleep-based assessments of chronotype; it correlates well with such physiological markers as dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and the minimum of the daily cortisol rhythm. They also state that each chronotype category \\"contains a similar portion of short and long sleepers\\". Chung et al. studied sleep quality in shift-working nurses and found that \\"the strongest predictor of sleep quality was morningness‚Äìeveningness, not the shift schedule or shift pattern\\", as \\"evening types working on changing shifts had higher risk of poor sleep quality compared to morning types\\". =Diurnal rhythms= Gibertini et al. assessed blood levels of the hormone melatonin, finding that the melatonin acrophase (the time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs) was strongly related to circadian type, whereas amplitude was not. They note that morning types evidence a more rapid decline in melatonin levels after the peak than do evening types. Baehr et al. found that, in young adults, the daily body temperature minimum occurred at about 4 a.m. for morning types but at about 6 a.m. for evening types. This minimum occurred at approximately the middle of the eight-hour sleep period for morning types, but closer to waking in evening types. Evening types had a lower nocturnal temperature. The temperature minimum occurred about a half-hour earlier in women than in men. Similar results were found by Mongrain et al. in Canada, 2004. Morning types had lower pain sensitivity throughout a day than evening types, but the two chronotype groups did not differ in the shape of diurnal variations in pain. There are some differences between chronotypes in sexual activity, with evening chronotypes preferring later hours for sex as compared to other chronotypes.Jankowski, K.S., D√≠az-Morales, J.F., Randler, C. (2014).Chronotype, gender, and time for sex. Chronobiology International, 31, 911-916. =Personality= Chronotypes differ in many aspects of personality, but also in intellectual domains, like creative thinking. =Intelligence= A meta analysis found a small positive association between an evening chronotype and intelligence; similar results were subsequently found in a large sample using a standardized battery. = Genetic variants associated with chronotype = Studies show that there are 22 genetic variants associated with chronotype. These variants occur near genes known to be important in photoreception and circadian rhythms. The variant most strongly associated with chronotype occurs near RGS16, which is a regulator of G-protein signalling and has a known role in circadian rhythms. In mice, gene ablation of Rgs16 lengthens the circadian period of behavioural rhythm. By temporally regulating cAMP signalling, Rgs16 has been shown to be a key factor in synchronising intercellular communication between pacemaker neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the centre for circadian rhythm control in humans. PER2 is a well-known regulator of circadian rhythms and contains a variant recently shown to be associated with iris formation. This suggests a link between iris function and chronotype. Per2 knockout mice show arrhythmic locomotor activity. The gene ASB1, associated with eveningness and a tendency to day-napping is a result of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans and is originally a Neanderthal trait, possibly linked to a more crepuscular lifestyle in this species. Therefore, the chronotype is genetically heritable. = Chronotype and disease= Disrupted circadian rhythms are associated with several human diseases, for example, chronotype is genetically correlated with BMI (body mass index). However, cause-and-effect is not yet determined.

The stream crosses the Roman road, Ermine Street, before going under the A10 and Cock Lane. The original crossing place or ford of Spital Brook in Cock Lane remains and the original route it took ran parallel to the brook in a north-south direction. The brook passes through its namesake area, Spital Brook and marks the traditional boundary between the two parishes of Hoddesdon and Broxbourne. The stream runs parallel to the Lea Valley Lines by Broxbourne Station until it meets the River Lea close to Broxbourne Riverside, the former Broxbourne Lido. Spital Brook's profile is relatively steep for a Hertfordshire water course, and loses approximately 50 metres of height over the 1 kilometre upper section.

The company is a subsidiary of The Dogg's company Mshasho closed cooperation.Mshasho is a company retrieved on 14/10/2011 The name Mshasho is derived from its original name Omushasho which is the Oshiwambo name for a shotgun. The label has shaped careers for artists such as Sunny Boy, OmPuff, Tre Van Die Kasie, TeQuila, Karlos Lokos, Chipolopolo, Richie and Kamasutra.The Dogg going on top with the launch of his new label, The Namibian news paper, September 2004 The label has so far released ten albums, making it one of the leading record labels in the country. History The Dogg's album Take Out Yo Gun was the label's first and only release in 2004. It dominated charts in 2005, with hits such as \\"The Dogg Is Back\\", \\"My life\\" and \\"Ngenge Ndasi\\". In early 2005, the label signed Sunny Boy, soon after departing from GMP Records. The label quickly released Sunny Boy's first single \\"Balance\\" which became another hit from the label. Sunny Boy enjoyed more success and became very popular. Soon after Sunny Boy was signed, former Mshasho manager Isack Nyambali signed TeQuila and Karlos Lokos to the label. He also brought Richie Rich, Chipolopolo and Kamasutra close to the label. In mid-2005, Mshasho added other new artist to its roster including Tre Van Die Kasie, Nasti, and surprisingly OmPuff (who was previously signed to GMP). Mshasho released Sunny's second single \\"serious\\" followed by his debut album Young, Black en Gifted in December 2005, around the same time The Dogg also released a new single \\"Baby Don't Go\\". The album was very successful and was one of the best selling albums of 2005; it introduced a new subgenre of kwaito which Sunny describe as Hikwa, a style of music that combines hip hop and kwaito. In October 2006, Sunny Boy left the label claiming financial mismanagement by former-manager Isack Nyambali (this is referenced in \\"Heat It Up\\" from The Sleeping Giant). He then made agreement with The Dogg to drop him off the label to go establish his own. Although he left the label, Sunny Boy still considers himself part of Mshasho. All of his albums after Young, Black en Gifted feature production and appearance by The Dogg, and other Mshasho artists. When Dogg was asked in an interview by Nammusic.com about his reaction to Sunny Boy leaving Mshasho, this is what he had to say; \\"Personally and professionally I am very happy for Sunny Boy leaving Mshasho to create his own label or production. It shows how much he has grown as an artist and we are still very close. I just don't want anybody to come between us as we are still very good friends and will remain that way.\\" Sunny Boy's departure made OmPuff the second favorite artist on Mshasho. Other artists such as TeQuila, Karlos Lokos and Richie also left the label after Sunny Boy. Isack Nyambali was fired from the label. The Dogg criticized him in an interview with Nammuic.com claiming \\"Isack is only in the industry to rip people off\\" referring to the corruption he committed when he was managing Sunny Boy, Karlos, and TeQuila. Nasti, OmPuff, and Tre were the only artists who remained on the label. Kwaito group Fresh Family was briefly signed to the label. The group was dropped from the label in March 2012 after breaching their contract. fresh-family-parts-ways-with-mshasho OmPuff and Tre Van Die Kasie are both working on their sophomore studio albums to be released in 2012 respectively.  Mshasho vs. GMP Records  The Dogg and Gazza developed quick success after releasing their first albums, which helped them into establish their own record label, Mshasho Productions and Gazza Music Productions (GMP) respectively. They led and dominated the commercial music scene between 2004 and 2005. GMP signed new and upcoming Sunny Boy, who served on the label for less than two months before signing with Mshasho. Tensions between the two labels were heightened when Sunny Boy switched labels from GMP to Mshasho. More fuel was added to the fire when some music fans began taking sides between The Dogg and Gazza, Mshasho and GMP. Also after a while OmPuff who was affiliated with GMP, joined Mshasho. The two labels are now reconciled and have done roadshows for the ruling party SWAPO together as well as performed some of their old collaborations at the Namibia Annual Music Awards.

Life When Huydecoper left on the Grand Tour in 1648 his father wanted to keep a firm grip on his 23-year-old son. He required him to be more studious, more thrifty, and demanded a complete list of names of the people with whom he associated. His father encouraged him to be thrifty and cut back on expenses.Roberts, B. (1998) Through the keyhole. Dutch child-rearing practices in the 17th and 18th century.

One of these, an unfinished painting by Simon de Vlieger of a brawny fisherman was given to Simon van der Stel, last Commander and first Governor of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa as a memento (herinnering). In 1681 he became a Councillor in the Admiralty of Amsterdam. In 1682 Joan Huydecoper and Jan Commelin took the initiative in establishing a new Hortus Medicus in Amsterdam. It differed from the herb garden at the Binnengasthuis insofar as it also grew ornamental plants and would function as a Hortus Botanicus.

At a height of , it is the highest point in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, as well as the highest point of German territory on the western bank of the Rhine. It lies within the Saar- Hunsr√ºck Nature Park.  Geography  = Location = The Erbeskopf lies in the southwest of the Hunsr√ºck and the Idar Forest - forming part of both natural regions - near their boundary with the Schwarzwalder Hochwald, to which it belongs morphologically. Its largest part and the summit are part of the municipality of Hilscheid in the county of Bernkastel-Wittlich. The rest belongs to Allenbach in the county of Birkenfeld. Its northeasterly neighbour, also in the Idar Forest, is the Kahlheid (766.0 m). The streams that rise near on the Erbeskopf are: the Idarbach whose source lies to the northeast below the subpeak of Sandkopf and thus south of the Kahlheid; the Thranenbach, the upper course of the Traunbach, whose source is southeast of the summit; the Hohltriefbach, whose source lies below the subpeak of Springenkopf and is a tributary of the R√∂derbach which rises northwest of the Erbeskopf; and the Simm to the north, a tributary of the Schalesbach. = Elevation = In 2008 a re-survey of the height of the Erbeskopf was conducted by the Rhineland- Palatinate State Office of Survey and Geobasis Information (Landesamt f√ºr Vermessung und Geobasisinformation Rheinland-Pfalz); using two independent survey measurements that each gave a height of 816.32 m. Its subpeaks, with their heights in metres (m) above sea level (Normalh√∂hennull or NHN), are: * Sandkopf (802.0 m), ca. 0.6 km northeast of the Erbeskopf * Springenkopf (784.2 m), ca. 1.7 km southwest of the Erbeskopf * Viehauskopf (720.7 m), ca. 1.3 km southwest of the Springenkopf * Hohltriefberg (680.6 m), ca. 0.8 km southwest of the Viehausberg  History  During a military exercise in 1892, sappers built a wooden observation tower on the mountain. In 1894, the Society for the Moselle, Hochwald and Hunsr√ºck (today the Hunsr√ºck Club) decided to construct a stone Emperor William Tower at the summit. This 24-metre-high tower was opened in 1901, 111 steps leading up to a viewing platform. In 1933 a kiosk was built at the entrance to the tower and a weather station installed at the top. In late August 1939 the tower was closed to civilians, three more storeys were added, military signals equipment was installed and it acted as the communication centre for a radio relay link from Berlin to the Atlantic coast. The weather station was upgraded. US troops occupied the Erbeskopf on 17 March 1945. They expanded its military facilities considerably and observed all military air traffic well into the territory of the Soviet Union. Three large radar towers and the Erwin Bunker with the wartime headquarters for Central Europe (AFCENT) supported NATO strategy as a multinational command post during the Cold War. The Emperor William Tower was blown up on 18 August 1961 because it obstructed the all-round military radar picture. In 1971 the 11-metre-high, wooden Erbeskopf Observation Tower or \\"Erbeskopf Tower\\" (Erbeskopfturm) was built outside the out-of-bounds area. The tower is of wooden design with three platforms. Although its views are now restricted by trees, in places there are good views as far as the Eifel. In the wake of the political easing of tension between NATO and the so-called Eastern Bloc states the significance of the listening equipment and electronic alarm systems on the Erbeskopf waned rapidly. Half a century after the end of the Second World War, American troops withdrew and the radar site continued in operation by the Bundeswehr. Until August 2004 the summit plateau was a heavily fenced-off, military out-of-bounds area. Since the removal of the barbed wire, most of the summit is now open to the public again. For centuries the Erbeskopf was crowned by a grove of mighty beech trees at the summit. In former times it was also called the Heiliger Hain (\\"Holy Copse\\"), although it is not recorded whether it had been a heathen site or Christian shrine. After the Emperor William Tower was blown up and widescale clearing took place, there were only a few remnants to give a poor impression of the original ancient trees.  Today  Windklang In 2011 the summit plateau was extensively remodelled. The so-called \\"conversion project\\", initiated by a special purpose association, the \\"Erbeskopf Winter Sports, Nature and Environmental Training Site\\" (Wintersport-, Natur- und Umweltbildungsst√§tte Erbeskopf), after the military had handed back part of the area, cost ‚Ç¨800,000, of which ‚Ç¨554,000 was pledged by the state. The sculptor, Christoph Mancke, in cooperation with landscape architects, Ernst+Partner of Trier, won the preceding competition for the \\"Use and Design of the Erbeskopf Summit\\" in a field of 29 participants. The sculpture, which may be walked on, was called Windklang (\\"Wind Tone\\") by Mancke and offers not just an outstanding view towards the northern side of the valley (the ski piste), but is also itself visible as a landmark from a long way off. Landscape architects, Ernst+Partner, built another, ground-level object, \\"Summits of the Region\\" (Gipfelk√∂pfe der Region), on the plateau, that points to other mountains in the region using concrete axes indicating their direction, height and distance. On the Erbeskopf there is a leisure and winter sports centre. Three ski lifts operate in the winter and a sommerrodelbahn in the warmer months. In the winter of 2005/2006, the lifts were open for a record 88 days. The ski piste is used in summer as part of the Erbeskopf Mountain Bike Marathon. Since 2007 the Saar-Hunsr√ºck-Steig long-distance path has included the Erbeskopf within the leg from B√∂rfink to Morbach. The Hunsr√ºckhaus at the northwest foot of the mountain is well known nationally as an environmental training centre. It offers an interactive exhibition on the nature of the Hunsr√ºck, a woodland play park, a senses educational path, a weather survey garden, an environmental laboratory and a conference centre with modern media technology. A footpath used to run from the Mark Thalfang into Birkenfelder Land. At the highest point of the way, very close to the summit of the Erbeskopf travellers would stop to say a prayer. This is still commemorated by a stone inscribed with the word Gottlob (\\"Praise to God\\"). On 29 April 2012 a \\"sculpture path\\" was opened on the newly remodelled summit plateau. The six additional works of art were displayed until 15 September 2012.

The poem is one of Wordsworth's best known poems and the subject of much critical literature. It tells the story of an aging shepherd, Michael, his wife, and his only child Luke. Michael lost half his land when he used it as a surety for a nephew who had met with financial misfortune. When Luke reaches the age of 18, Michael sends Luke to stay in London with a merchant that he might learn a trade and acquire sufficient wealth to regain the land that Michael has lost. It breaks Michael's heart to send Luke away and he makes Luke lay the first stone of a sheepfold as a covenant between them that Luke will return. However, Luke is corrupted in the city and is forced to flee the country and Michael must live out his life without his son. He returns sometimes to the sheepfold but no longer has the heart to complete it. The epigraph of George Eliot's Silas Marner is taken from the poem. The story of \\"Michael\\" may derive in part from the famous Parable of the Prodigal Son in the Bible. References *  External links  * Text of Michael at RPO, University of Toronto.

It is the successor to both the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) and the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP).  Activities  The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety provides the European Commission with scientific advice on the safety of non-food consumer products. The SCCS's advice is intended to enable risk managers to take the adequate and required actions in order to guarantee consumer protection. The SCCS addresses questions in relation to the safety, allergenic properties, and impact on consumer health, of products and ingredients such as toys, textiles, clothing, cosmetics, personal care products, domestic products such as detergents, and consumer services such as tattooing. By the end of 2006 the SCCP had adopted close to 100 opinions or position papers on topics such as fragrances, hair dyes, sunbeds, tooth bleaching, preservatives, UV filters, and other substances.  Procedures  The SCCS consists of a maximum of 17 members. There is also a reserve list made up of candidates found suitable for a position in a Scientific Committee. The members of the SCCS are appointed on the basis of their skills and experience in the fields in question, and consistent with this a geographical distribution that reflects the diversity of scientific problems and approaches in the European Union. The experts are appointed for three years, renewable a maximum of three consecutive times. In agreement with the Commission, the Scientific Committees may turn to specialised external experts. The SCCS complies with the principles of independence, transparency and confidentiality. The members therefore make a declaration of commitment to act in the public interest and a declaration of interests. Requests for opinions, agendas, minutes and opinions are published. The work and publications respect commercial confidentiality.  History  The scientific committees were originally established by Commission Decision 97/404/EC of 10 June 1997. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) was originally established as one of three scientific committees established by Commission Decision 2004/210/EC of 3 March 2004, replacing the former Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP).

The episcopal see is the Arras Cathedral, in the city of Arras. The diocese encompasses all of the Department of Pas-de-Calais, in the Region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The most significant jurisdictional changes all occurred during the Napoleonic wars. From 1802 to 1841, the diocese was suffragan of the Archdiocese of Paris, shifting away from the Archdiocese of Cambrai, after Napoleon dissolved the massive Archdiocese. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Napoleonic Concordat united the diocese of Arras, diocese of Saint-Omer and diocese of Boulogne together in one much larger diocese. Unlike most of the other dioceses immediately restored, it was not until 1841 that the diocese returned as a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Cambrai. History A person named Martin is said to have evangelized Artois and Arras, capital of the Celtic Atrebates by 350AD; however, these early Christian communities did not survive the barbarian invasions of the Roman Empire in the fifth century.Dioc√®se d'Arras, Histoire du dioc√®se d'Arras.

His successors, Dominicus and Vedulphus, are also both venerated as saints. After the death of Vedulphus, the See of Arras was transferred to Cambrai, and it was not until 1093 that Arras again became a diocese. At the time of the reform of the bishoprics of the Netherlands in 1559, the diocese had 422 parishes. Its metropolitan was changed from Reims to Cambrai by Pope Paul IV.12 May 1559: Gallia christiana III, pp. 318-321.

There were some 400 parishes and 12 rural deans. King Philip II of Spain and Pope Pius IV founded the University of Douai in 1562 as a weapon in the Counterreformation and the French Wars of Religion. The Jesuits had a college at Douai, founded in 1599, and suppressed in 1762.Gallia christiana III, pp. 318-319. Jean, p. 176. During the French revolution the diocese of Arras was abolished and subsumed into a new diocese, the 'Pas de Calais', coterminous with the new 'Departement of the Pas-de- Calais', and a suffragan of the 'Metropole des C√¥tes de la Manche'. The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the departement. This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope.

Huydecoper had a prosperous political career: first he was elected to the vroedschap of Amsterdam. He was six times a mayor of Amsterdam.  Biography  Van Marsseveen was born in Amsterdam. In 1602, his father was an initial investor in the Dutch East India Company.Israel, J. (1989) Dutch Primacy in World Trade, 1585-1740, p. 71. He also had shares in the Magellan Company, that traded with South America.Gaastra, F. (1989) Bewind en beleid bij de VOC (1672-1702), p. 257. In 1622 his son bought a property in the Jordaan, where he had seven houses built, three of which along the Lauriergracht. Johan Huydecoper is mentioned as the first person in Amsterdam, who bought a painting from Rembrandt.Schwarz, G. (1987) Rembrandt, p. 134. Huydecoper and Rembrandt probably met each other at an early stage, as they both lived or worked in the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. Huydecoper became a connoisseur of fine arts and was friendly with Jan Vos (poet), who praised his house and collection of paintings in several poems, one on a painting by Rubens. In 1639, Philip Vingboons designed his mansion on Singel; the house was destroyed in 1943, when two English planes collided in midair and one came down on the house. (One of the few spots in Amsterdam that were damaged during the Second World War). Huydecoper was also a real-estate developer along the river Vecht (Utrecht), where he had his country house. Schwartz wrote: \\"What art could contribute to Maarsseveen: architecture to beautify it, map-making to advertise it, and poetry to immortalise it. He used the patronage he wielded in Amsterdam to put artists scholars, and publishers to work for him in Maarsseveen\\".Schwartz, G. (1983) Jan van der Heyden and the Huydecoper of Maarsseveen. In: The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal XI, p. 197. In 1650, Huydecoper had the gates closed, the bridges lifted, and the city protected, when William II of Orange tried to attack Amsterdam. He was involved in the building and decoration of the new city hall on Dam Square. During his office as a burgomaster, he chose the side of Cornelis de Graeff and made several diplomatic trips; in 1653 he went to L√ºbeck and he represented the city in 1655 at the baptism of the son of Frederick William of Brandenburg, and in 1660 at the coronation of Charles II of England.Roberts, B.

He performs a brand of music known as hikwa, which he engineered by fusing hip hop and Kwaito.Nammusic.com Home of Namibian stars Sunny Boy's mini biography 02/03/09Sunny Boy talks of win-win with The Dogg, Gazza 13/02/12 He rose to fame after collaborating with Gazza on his song \\"Koko\\" in 2004. He increased his buzz with his hit single \\"Balance\\" in 2005 when he signed with Mshasho Productions. He is known for his socially conscious lyrics, story telling abilities and a complex flow. He has to date released four albums from which he gained critical acclaim as a lyricist. He plans to release his fourth album in 2012. Sunny runs his own record label Yaziza Entertainment. He is the former Ambassador of the Namibia Red Cross Society's for the youth.  Early life  Sunny Boy was born, Pendukeni Andreas Sunday Shipushu, in Oshakati, a town in northern Namibia, and grew up in its neighbour Ongwediva. Since he was a small boy, he has always wanted to make music that touches people's hearts. He used to sing and dance at school concerts. While at primary school, he and three other friends formed a dancing group called The Converse Boys, and with their Kwaito inspired moves, they entertained fellow students at social events. Even then, they dreamed of one day making it big in the music industry. However that dream was cut short by the untimely death of one of their group members. = Early career = While a student at the University of Namibia, Sunny befriended The Dogg, a fellow student and up-coming artist at the time who then introduced him to Gazza. Gazza was impressed when he heard him Sunny rap on a hip hop track. Gazza then decided to do a collaboration with him on a song \\"Koko\\". The song became a huge hit in Namibia and through that Sunny Boy started to hang out with The Dogg and Gazza. He would travel with them for performance. After Gazza launched his record label, Gazza Music Productions he immediately offered Sunny Boy a record deal. Sunny Boy refused the deal to sign with The Dogg's Mshasho Productions. An act that latter became the centre point of the conflict between Gazza and The Dogg. Before he had a single, he would tour with The Dogg and Gazza to various towns as a back up artist. His first single \\"Ballance\\" brought a new vibe to the Namibian kwaito, with multiple of language use, the song became a huge hit. With its lay back beat, Sunny proved that kwaito is not only about singing and repeating words. He approached the song in a hip hop fashion with multiple catchy rhymes. The song was produced by DJ Kboz. Sunny called the style he used on \\"Balance\\" Hikwa which he describe as a fusion of hip hop and Kwaito. This style would later become popular among Namibian hip hop and kwaito artist.  Music career  = (2005) Young, Black en Gifted = Sunny Boy released his much anticipated debut album, Young, Black en Gifted, through Mshasho Productions, in December 2005. The album was very successful with hits songs such as \\"Balance\\", \\"Serious\\" and \\"Oshaikengaho\\". Around the same time, he was featured on The Dogg's Channel O Music Video Awards winning song \\"Baby Don't Go\\". Production on the album was handled mainly by The Dogg, Elvo and DJ Kboz. Guest features includes The Dogg, Chipolopolo, Luvy, TeQuila and Kboz. The album was well received making it one of the best albums to be released under Mshasho Records. It was well crafted with lyrical structure which focus mostly on feel good and party themes. The song \\"Serious\\" is a motivational song. Videos were released for \\"Balance\\" and \\"Serious\\". The song \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" performed by Faizel MC featuring The Dogg and Sunny Boy was added to the album as a bonus track. His lyrical ability on the other hand placed him above all, and has influenced a lot of upcoming artists at the time, including Qonja among others. The two would later collaborated on \\"Fashion\\" from Qonja's Mdakadaka and \\"Yamkwanekamba\\" from Sunny's The Sleeping Giant. = (2006) Departing from Mshasho ‚Äì Elai Lineendunge = In September 2006, Sunny Boy left Mshasho Records, and launched his own record label, GreenHouse Entertainment (now Yaziza Entertainment). After financial issues and disappointments from his former manager Isak Nyambali, Sunny felt it was better to establish his own record label and be his own boss. An agreement was reached between him and The Dogg to revise his contract. He established GreenHouse Entertainment in 2006 (renamed; Yaziza Entertainment in 2008) which brought into the industry more of his hikwa style. Upon its creation Sunny immediately started working on his second album, Elai Lineendunge. The album was released in December 2006 under GreenHouse Entertainment. The album is darker than his first, and feature more of his hikwa style music. It was approached with a different style from his last release. While Young, Black en Gifted focused more on feel good and party music, Elai Lineendunge focused more on story telling and wordplay. The album showcased Sunny Boy's lyrical ability distinguishing him from his colleagues in the industry. The album feature guest appearance from The Dogg, OmPuff, Chipolopo, TeQuila, and Kamasutra. While production was handled by The Dogg, Elvo and Morgan. The album holds the record of being the only, in Namibia to be nominated more than five times for seven categories at the 2007 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. The Video of the album's most successful song \\"Summertime\\" was nominated for the 2008 Channel O Music Video Awards. = (2008) Channel-O nomination ‚Äì The Sleeping Giant = Sunny Boy became the third Namibian kwaito artist to be nominated for a Channel-O award after The Dogg and Gazza. He was nominated in August 2008 in the category of \\"best kwaito video\\" where he competed with South Africa's Kabelo, Arthur, Big Nuz and Namibia's The Dogg. Sunny Boy released his third studio album, The Sleeping Giant in December 2008. The first single \\"Oseike Naave\\" was released in October, and debuted at number one on various local radio stations. The album features Production from Elvo, The Dogg, Kboz, and Morgan among others, and appearance by TeQuila, Jericho, Hedek, Qonja, Luvy, Chipolopolo and Tre Van Die Kasie. The album scooped hits such as \\"Touch Me Tease Me\\" which features Lady May and \\"Heat It Up\\" which won song of the year at the 2009 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. = 2009 ‚Äì present = In 2009 Sunny Boy appeared on Chipolopolo's single \\"Mr. She-Me\\" a diss song responding to then-GMP signed group Streetskids and Gazza. In that year he appeared in The Windhoek Observer newspaper where he leaked information of his upcoming album. Though planned for release in 2009, the year went by without it seeing the light of day. In 2010 Sunny Boy stated that his and Chipolopolo's albums were coming out that year, but there was nothing released. In 2011 Sunny Boy changed managers from his sister Cathy Shipushu, who has been his managers since the establishment of Yaziza Entertainment, to Mercy Hoabes. Under Mercy's management Sunny Boy embarked on tours and started working on his fourth studio album. He would later appeared on two songs from The Dogg's album The Deception, one of which features Brikz from South Africa and the other he appeared with OmPuff and JK from Zambia.  Controversies with Gazza  Sunny Boy was first heard on Gazza's hit song \\"Koko\\" in 2004, which developed the duo into a good relationship. He refused to sign to Gazza's GMP Records. He then signed with The Dogg's Mshasho label same months later. Gazza explain the refusal as unfair and labelled Sunny a betrayal. Because he brought him into the game. As a prot√©g√© of The Dogg and member of the Mshasho label, Sunny Boy got more and more involved in the beef between The Dogg and Gazza, ironically known as \\"Mshasho vs. G.M.P.\\". He also exchanged verses with Gazza. He challenged Gazza on many of his songs. In 2008 he released a hip hop track titled \\"Intro\\" off his third album, where he called Gazza out. The song \\"Oyetu\\" also diss Gazza indirectly. In 2009, Gazza's crew StreetKids dissed Sunny on their song \\"Who's Fooling Who\\". Sunny replied through Chipolopolo's single titled \\"Mr She-Me\\" in which they make fun of Gazza and his girlfriend. The title of the song is also a mock of Gazza's surname Shiimi. Musical style, rapping technique and influences Sunny Boy fused hip hop and Kwaito to create a sound he calls hikwa. Hikwa is composed of elements of both genres, although vocally it reflects more into hip hop. A lot of other artists has start to use this form of Kwaito to put more lyrics into their songs. Although Sunny Boy does not take credit for inventing the style, rapping in Kwaito has been used before by South African Kwaito artists such as Zola, Kabelo, Mandoza, Brown Dash and Brickz, however he was the first to populate it in Namibia. Sunny Boy is also acclaimed for his complex rapping technique which includes the use of multisyllabic rhymes. He is well skilled with crafting intricate and intelligent rhymes. Sunny Boy also uses extended metaphor to elaborate his lyrics. His raps are mixed between three languages, (English, Afrikaans and Oshiwambo), of which he highly maintain the a story without losing its meaning. Another rapper who uses this technique is Qonja, but what set Sunny Boy aside is the ability to cohesively run back-and-forth between the three languages by telling the same story and bending words so that they rhyme. Sunny Boy's draws most of his inspiration from hip hop. He named American rappers The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur, Jay-Z and Nas among others as his main influences. His voice pattern, flow and rhyme delivery is compared to that of Nas who is highly praised as one of hip hop's greatest poets. He also mentioned, Brickz and Brown Dash of South Africa as one of his influences.

Arrival in Nicaragua Gottel was born in Danzig, Germany and emigrated to the United States at a young age. He spoke English, Spanish and German. When the gold rush struck in California he arranged for a trip via Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company which took a natural route through the San Juan river in Nicaragua. Gottel decided to stay in Rivas, a city located in Nicaragua's Southwestern Pacific region. He later established a contract with the Accessory Transit Company. Gottels contract with the Accessory Transit Company consisted of diligences hauled by horses to transport people between Bah√≠a de la Virgen (Bay of the Virgin) in Lake Nicaragua and the port in San Juan del Sur. In 1856 it left him in ruins due to the struggle between William Walker and Vanderbilt. Gottel resumed his diligence service in 1861 with his new partner, Colombian General Pedro Ruiz Tejada. After Gottels death, Ruiz kept the service going and added a new route from Le√≥n to Chinandega. In 1872, Gottel traveled to Guatemala to recover archives corresponding to the history of Nicaragua. Due to the country's instability at the time, the valuable historical documents were sent to San Francisco, California to be protected. To date, the archives remain in the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley. El Porvenir Gottel founded a weekly newspaper in Rivas in 1865, \\"El Porvenir de Nicaragua\\" (\\"The Future of Nicaragua\\"), that was published every Saturday and was bilingual; Spanish and English. El Porvenir was the first newspaper that did not depend on protection from a political party or government favors. Gottel ran the newspaper for 9 years, up until 1874. El Provenir was transferred to Managua, where Fabio Carnevalini, an Italian immigrant, served as its editor from the year of Gottel's death to May 21, 1885. That same year Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Somoza, son of the German immigrant Karl Hermann, took over the newspaper, which was then published twice a week, however, publication stopped in 1886. Rub√©n Dar√≠o, considered the Father of Modernism, was one of the prominent writer to collaborate with the newspaper. Death Gottel died January 11, 1875 in Managua. His funeral was attended by then President Jos√© Vicente Cuadra, members of the government, Fabio Carnevalini, and Francisco Deshon, among others. He would have been buried at the San Pedro cemetery in Managua, which was built in 1862 and was the city's first cemetery. However, after the construction of the cemetery, the local Catholic Church restricted burial to Catholic citizens. Due to Gottel's origins and the fact that he was a freemason, the church did not allow his burial at San Pedro because of Roman Catholicism opposition to Freemasonry. Julian Bhalke, also a Nicaraguan of German origin, bought a piece of land just north of the San Pedro cemetery and buried Gottel there. The day Gottel was buried, Bhalke decided to make his land a cemetery and named it \\"Cementerio de los Extanjeros\\" (Cemetery of Foreigners), which was officially inaugurated on January 5, 1885.

The plant lacks chlorophyll and obtains its nutrients and water in a parasitic fashion from the black saxaul (Haloxylon ammodendron) and white saxaul (Haloxylon persicum). Description Cistanche deserticola is a perennial hardy, shrub-like herb tall. It is shaped somewhat like a cross between a pine cone and a pineapple, with thick, fleshy stems and large, yellow flowers that grow smaller at the plant's apex. Distribution Cistanche deserticola is widely distributed in China's deserts including the provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai, and the Autonomous Regions of Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia. Traditional uses Along with other members of the genus Cistanche, Cistanche deserticola is a noted source of the Chinese herbal medicine cistanche (), commonly called Rou Cong Rong. Pharmaceutical materials, known in Chinese as suosuo dayuan (), are produced by slicing the stems of the plant. Inner Mongolia is the top native-producing area of the species; annual production is about 70 tons. The stems are gathered in the spring, when the sprouts have not come out of the ground or have just come up, dried in the sun and cut into slices for medicinal use. Cistanche deserticola has been placed on CITES Appendix 2, a list of endangered species not banned from trade but requiring monitoring. With increased consumption of cistanche, the population of the species has decreased and its area of distribution has shrunk. Aside from over-collection or indiscriminate collection, an important factor in the diminished supply of cistanche is a loss of the saxaul host, which is widely used for firewood.

The priority is to encourage wildlife, not human visitors and there will be no visitor centre or permanent structures, but a public footpath which crosses the site will be improved and hides built along the footpath at key vantage points.

They lack chlorophyll and obtain nutrients and water from the host plants whose roots they parasitize. Uses Along with other members of the genus, Cistanche deserticola is the primary source of the Chinese herbal medicine cistanche (Chinese: ËÇâËãÅËìâ, pinyin r√≤uc≈çngr√≥ng). The main sources of cistanche are Cistanche salsa and Cistanche deserticola, although it may also be obtained from Cistanche tubulosa, Cistanche sinensis, and Cistanche ambigua. The drug, known in Chinese as suosuo dayun, is collected in spring before sprouting, by slicing the stems of the plant. Cistanche deserticola has been placed on CITES Appendix 2, a list of endangered species not banned from trade but requiring monitoring. With increased consumption of cistanche, the population of the species has decreased and its area of distribution has shrunk. Aside from over-collection or indiscriminate collection, an important factor in the diminished supply of cistanche is a loss of the saxaul host, Haloxylon ammodendron, which is widely used for firewood. Cistanche has been used as a medicine for about 1800 years and is recorded in the Shennong Bencao Jing and Bencao Gangmu as a tonic. Most of the medicinal claims have never been evaluated through clinical testing, and those claims that have been examined under controlled medical study are not supported. Growth Growing in arid climates, cistanche is a parasitic plant that connects to the conductive system of a host, extracting water and nutrients from the roots of the host plant. Cistanche is native to the Taklimakan desert region of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region northwest China where it grows on host desert plants tamarix and haloxylon ammodendron.Cistanche Tubulosa and Deserticola: An In Depth Analysis http://urbol.com/cistanche-tubulosa-and- deserticola/ References Category:Orobanchaceae Category:Orobanchaceae genera Category:Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine ","title":"Cistanche"},{"id":"14017095","text":"Tma≈à is a municipality and village in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic.

Overview With the opening events of the Revolution, the revolutionary Avignonnais had forced a new municipal election, expelled the papal vice-legate (12 June 1790) and demanded to be united with France, but the conservative rural population of Carpentras remained faithful to their papal overlord. The outcome was virtually civil war in the region, with assassinations and mob violence. In the superheated atmosphere, following circulated reports of miraculous tears on the Madonna of the Cordeliers, a papiste mob lynched a patriot municipal administrator, Nicolas Jean-Baptiste Lescuyer, who was falsely suspected of planning to seize church property. Jean Duprat, a silk merchant elected mayor of Avignon the previous June, was suspected of having participated. Some sixty persons were summarily executed in a tower of the Palais des Papes, following the lynching. Amnesty for the executioners, as patriots, was debated in Paris, as justice in revolutionary France became more and more politicised. Mathieu Jouve Jourdan (fr), nicknamed \\"Jourdan Coupe-T√™te\\", was implicated in the atrocities, eventually traduced to the revolutionary tribunal, condemned to death and guillotined on 8 prairial II (27 May 1794). The savage massacres of La Glaci√®re, dramatised in popular engravings, were traumatic in the region and appalled the reading public of the Age of Enlightenment; they reverberated for a generation. Jules Michelet devoted two chapters of his massive history of the Revolution to the massacres. Sources *Martin, Jean-Cl√©ment, Violence et R√©volution: Essai sur la naissance d‚Äôun mythe national.

History of nowadays neighbourhoods, formers villages or towns, is naturally longer however slightly different. Kr√°l≈Øv Dv≈Ør was in direct royal possession, established in 1236. Kr√°l≈Øv Dv≈Ør was royal hunting residence, a chateau has been preserved although widely damaged by built D5 highway. Kr√°l≈Øv Dv≈Ør is known for an incident involving bohemian king and Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. Wenceslaus, escaping from capital city, was captured by bohemian nobility what happened in 8th May 1394. In 1860, the chateau was sold to Emil Egon F√ºrstenberg who had no interest to keep the property in good shape and the chateau was used as a warehouse. After WWII the chateau was nationalized, state enterprises kept using buildings as a warehouse. its garden was used as a path for D5 highway. The chateau was sold to private property in 2000. Karlova Hu≈• was an iron smetlery eshablished in 16th century by noble family of Karlov√© ze Sv√°rova, however local history of iron smelting is ancient.

Cordless nail guns do not need an air compressor, manufactured by Paslode. Instead they use what its maker calls a \\"fuel cell\\": this is not what is correctly called a fuel cell, but a small metal can filled with pressurized, flammable gas. There is also a battery pack and a high-voltage power supply to deliver a spark. The design resembles a small two stroke engine. The combustion chamber is in two parts and is normally open to the atmosphere. When the contact tip is pushed onto a piece of work, the lower piston chamber (which also serves as the piston bore) is pushed into the upper part, sealing it. Simultaneously, a metered amount of fuel is squirted into the chamber from the fuel cell. When the trigger is pulled, a spark plug ignites the fuel charge, pushes the piston and connected drive pin to the bottom of the chamber, and drives a nail. A small amount of combustion gas is briefly stored in a side chamber and is used to push the piston back into the ready position after the nail is driven. After the contact tip is lifted from the work, the combustion chamber opens and a small fan blows away the exhaust gas. Pressing the contact tip to the work without pulling the trigger uses one of the metered fuel charges. The unburned fuel is then blown away by the exhaust fan when the contact tip is removed from the work. These are best used in finish-nailing situations and is where these tools are most common. Paslode Impulse guns are available as framing and finish nailers using a variety of nail types and lengths. They are well known by tradesmen for the smell of the emitted spent gas, which some may find offensive. The fuel is a mixture of 1-butene and propane. The fuel cells are designed to last for 1,000 rounds each, which makes them desirable for heavy duty projects where thousands of nails/staples are needed.

Many of the Taira samurai threw themselves into the waves rather than live to see their clan's ultimate defeat at the hands of the Minamoto. Antoku's grandmother, Taira no Tokiko, Kiyomori's widow, leapt into the water with the young emperor clasped firmly in her arms.Kitagawa, pp. 676-677. Kenrei-mon In also tried to drown herself; but according to the conventionally accepted accounts, she was pulled out with a rake by her long hair.Kitagawa, pp. 678; Titsingh, p. 212. =Buddhist nun= This sometime daughter, wife, and mother of emperors became a recluse in her later years. * Bunji 1, on the 1st day of the 5th month (1185): Kenrei-mon In took the tonsure at Ch≈çraku-ji, a branch temple of Enryaku-ji on Higashiyama.Kitagawa, pp. 763-765. * Bunji 1, on the 30th day of the 9th month (1185): Kenrei-mon In retreated further from the world when she moved to , a Buddhist nunnery near the village of , northeast of the Heian-ky≈ç.Kitagawa, pp. 766-768, 787....Click for link to photos of Jakk≈ç-in and ≈åhara * Bunji 2, on the 20th day of the 4th month (1186): Gy≈çshin, the cloistered former-Emperor Go-Shirakawa, visited Kenrei- mon In at her rural retreat in ≈åhara.Kitagawa, pp. 769-779, 788. * Kenky≈´ 2, in the 2nd month (1192): Kenrei-mon In dies in ≈åhara.Kitagawa, pp. 780-782, 788. [Although The Tale of the Heike gives 1192 as the year of Kenrei-mon In's death, the Gukansh≈ç identifies 1213 as the year of her death -- cf. Brown, p. 333.] This once-pampered great lady is said to have composed this poem in her hermit's hut: In literature Many stories and works of art depict this period in Japanese history, and it is through these sources that the life of Taira no Tokuko is best known. The Tale of the Heike is the most famous of the sources from which we learn about this historical character, although many kabuki and bunraku plays reproduce events of the war as well. The central theme of the Heike story‚Äîand the mirrored theme of Taira no Tokuko's life story‚Äîis a demonstration of the Buddhist law of impermanence. The theme of impermanence (muj≈ç) is captured in the opening passage: > The sound of the Gion Sh≈çja bells echoes the impermanence of all things; the > color of the sƒÅla flowers reveals the truth that the prosperous must > decline. The proud do not endure, they are like a dream on a spring night; > the mighty fall at last, they are as dust before the wind.McCullough, Helen > Craig. (1988). The Tale of the Heike,. In this and other classic Japanese tales, the central figures are popularly well known, the major events are generally understood, and the stakes as they were understood at the time are conventionally accepted as elements in the foundation of Japanese culture. The accuracy of each of these historical records has become a compelling subject for further study; and some accounts have been shown to withstand close scrutiny, while other presumed ‚Äúfacts‚Äù have turned out to be inaccurate.Brown, pp. 385-386. In English-language literature, Tokuko's life and reign are depicted throughout the two-volume historical fiction narrative, White as Bone, Red as Blood, by Cerridwen Fallingstar, published in 2009 and 2011, respectively.White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Fox Sorceress (2009), and White as Bone, Red as Blood: The Storm God (2011).

Cohen (27 July 1919 - London, 28 January 2011) was an English classical violinist. Biography =Early life and education= Born in Manchester into a musical family, Cohen first took violin lessons from his father, a schoolmaster and amateur violinist. He also studied violin with Charles Hanke and Lionel Falkman in his youth. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School, and at age 15, he won the Adolph Brodsky scholarship to the Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern College of Music). There, he studied with Henry Holst, former leader of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Within a year, he won a spot in the Hall√© Orchestra as their youngest ever member. At age 19, he played the Bach, Mendelssohn and Brahms concertos with the Hall√© in one evening. =Career= Cohen spent two summers leading an orchestra in Blackpool, where he gained experience playing music ranging from The White Horse Inn to Beethoven symphonies and appearing twice a week as soloist. With the war looming, and while still at college, Cohen appeared as soloist in concerts and broadcasts throughout the North of England. Cohen spent six years in the Royal Corps of Signals Band, playing the clarinet but still practising the violin, learning new repertoire, and even playing single movements of a violin concerto (Mendelssohn's) with the band. By the time he was demobilised, he had a repertoire of nearly 40 violin concertos. While still in uniform, he won the first Carl Flesch International Violin Competition in 1945. This brought him to the notice of the musical world and soon led to concerts and recitals all over Britain and Europe. By this time, Cohen had settled in London, and alongside his solo career, was in demand as a chamber music player, orchestral leader and teacher. He was a professor at the Royal College of Music. He was leader of the Goldsborough Orchestra (later to become the English Chamber Orchestra), the Haydn, the New Symphony and the Pro Arte Orchestras, and also guest-led most of the UK's leading chamber orchestras as well as the Philharmonia, the London Symphony and BBC Symphony Orchestras. In 1959, Sir Thomas Beecham appointed Cohen leader of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, a post Cohen held for six years. One of the highlights of that period was his 1960 appearance as soloist at the Royal Festival Hall (RFH) with the RPO and Beecham in the Goldmark violin concerto, in what proved to be Beecham's final concert at the RFH. Following his term as RPO leader, Cohen continued a career as a soloist and increased his work in chamber music. He appeared as soloist and recitalist with his wife Anthya Rael, in such countries as the USA, New Zealand, Russia, and South Africa, as well as appearing frequently in Britain and Europe. He was soloist with such conductors as Barbirolli, Sargent, Kletzki, Kempe, Monteux, Boult and Beecham, and among his \\"firsts\\" were the first performance in Britain of the Kabalevsky concerto and the Shostakovich sonata, the first performance of the Skalkottas concerto in the composer's native Greece (Athens Festival), the first artist to appear on British television playing a violin concerto (the Mendelssohn), and the first performance on video in England of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. =Marriage and children= In 1953, Cohen married the pianist Anthya Rael. She had come from her native South Africa to study with the pianist and teacher Ilona Kabos. They had two children: Gillian, a violinist, and Robert, a cellist. Raymond and Robert gave duo recitals and appeared together in the Brahms Double concerto. Anthya joined her husband and son to form the Cohen Trio. In 1993, the family was featured in a BBC radio programme called \\"The Musical World of Raymond Cohen\\". His widow and children survive him.

The group was founded in 1968 by four Cambridge undergraduates. There have been a number of changes in personnel over the years, but Alan George from the original quartet is still a member as of 2019. It currently consists of Alan George, viola; Sally Pendlebury, violoncello; and Lucy Russell and Marcus Barcham Stevens, violins. The Fitzwilliam Quartet was one of the first of a long line of quartets to have emerged under the guidance of Sidney Griller at the Royal Academy of Music. They became well known through their close personal association with Dmitri Shostakovich, who befriended them following a visit to York to hear them play. He entrusted them with the Western premi√®res of his last three quartets, and before long they had become the first group to perform and record all fifteen. These recordings gained international awards, and secured for the quartet a worldwide concert schedule and a long term contract with Decca/London. In 1977, they won the first ever Gramophone Award for chamber music. In November 2005 the Shostakovich set was included in Gramophone magazine's \\"100 Greatest Recordings\\". Today, the FSQ performs a wide repertoire, from the late 17th century to the present day, and remains one of the few established quartets to play on historical instrument setups. In May 2000, a collaboration with Linn Records began with Haydn's The Seven Last Words of Christ. Recordings continued with the Brahms Clarinet Quintet together with clarinetist Lesley Schatzberger. They have made a disc of 20th- century English songs with piano quintet (including Vaughan Williams's On Wenlock Edge), featuring collaborations with James Gilchrist and Anna Tilbrook. 2012 saw the release of two contemporary recordings, by geologist and composer John Ramsay on Divine Art Records and by South African composer and pianist Michael Blake. In addition to his Fitzwilliam duties, Alan George is the Musical Director of the Academy of St Olave's chamber orchestra. Residencies They have been resident quartet at several universities, including the University of Warwick in 1974-77. In 1998, they re-established their connection with Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, their namesake and their original rehearsal venue, when they were appointed Resident Quartet; they perform and lead workshops at the college. In 2010 they began a residency at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where they hold an annual string chamber music workshop, Strings in Spring. They are in residence at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.

Such stressors might occur in the natural environment at densities, concentrations or levels high enough to disrupt the natural biochemistry, physiology, behavior and interactions of the living organisms that comprise the ecosystem. Ecotoxicology has been defined as, \\"the branch of toxicology concerned with the study of toxic effects, caused by natural or synthetic pollutants, to the constituents of ecosystems, animal (including human), vegetable and microbial, in an integral context\\".  Common environmental toxicants  # Diethyl phthalate, that enter environments through industries manufacturing cosmetics, plastic and many other commercial products. # Bisphenol A (BPA), found in many mass-produced products such as, medical devices, food packaging, cosmetics, children's toys, computers, CD's, etc. # Pharmaceuticals such as Climbazole, a fungicide found in anti-dandruff shampoos. # Pesticides # Some but not all; cleaning products, laundry detergents, fabric softeners, oven cleaners, disinfectants # Phosphates # Oil  Everyday hazards  In Canada, there is no law requiring manufactures to state the health and environmental hazards associated with their cleaning products. Many people buy such products to support a clean and healthy home, often unaware of the products ability to harm both their own health and the surrounding environment. \\"Canadians spend more than $275 million on household cleaning products in a year\\" Chemicals from these cleaners enter our bodies through air passageways and absorption through the skin and when these cleaning products are washed down the drain they negatively affect aquatic ecosystems. There are also no regulations in place stating that the ingredients be listed on labels of cleaning products leading the users to be ultimately unaware of the chemicals they expose themselves and their surrounding environments to. = Fragrance chemicals = Fragrance chemicals are found in most cleaning products, perfumes, and personal care products. More than 3000 chemicals are used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in detergents accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments. = Phosphates = Phosphates are found in many dishwasher detergents, laundry detergents, and bathroom cleaners. They act as a fertilizer in water and in high concentrations can promote algae blooms and increase weed growth. When water containing phosphates are washed into water areas they carry with them fertilizers, nutrients, and wastes from the land. Phytoplankton and algae flourish at the surface due to increased phosphates. Dead phytoplankton and other organisms sink to the bottom giving rise to large numbers of decomposers due to increased food supply (dead organisms, phytoplankton). Due to the increased number of decomposers that use more oxygen, fish and shrimp at the lower layers of the ocean become oxygen-starved and hypoxic zones become apparent. = Quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) = Quats are anti-microbial agents that are found in bathroom cleaners, fabric softeners, and degreasers. They are a class of irritants and sensitizers that negatively affect people who suffer from asthma. Chemicals in this class are persistent in aquatic environments, and toxic to the organisms that live in these environments. Many researchers are concerned that their widespread use in everyday household disinfectants and cosmetics are contributing to antibiotic resistant bacteria, thus limiting microbial infection treatment options. =Trisodium nitrilotriacetate= Trisodium nitrilotriacetate is found in bathroom cleaners and possibly some laundry detergents although more actively used in industrial formulations. Small amounts add up in the environment and add to an overall toxic issue. In aquatic ecosystems these chemicals cause heavy metals in sediment to redissolve and many of these metals are toxic to fish and other wildlife.  Plasticizers  Phthalates and BPA date back to the 1920s and 1930s. Phthalates have been applied as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) additives since 1926, but were also used for health care purposes as insect repellents and cercaricides. BPA is present in most aquatic environments, entering water systems through landfills and sewage treatment plant runoff allowing for bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. These endocrine disrupters are a large group of chemicals that enter into the aquatic environment through the manufacturing of various industrial and consumer products, agriculture and food/drug processing, waste water treatment plants and human wastes. Phthalate esters are common additives that soften and make PVC more flexible. It is used in many everyday items such as medical devices, packaging for fragrances and cosmetics, ropes and varnishes, in plastic used to wrap food, and shower curtains. These Phthalate esters have been found in areas of water, air, sediment, and in gulfs and rivers around the world, Giam et al. as cited by. Phalates and BPA affect reproduction in animal groups such as Molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians and fish. Most of these plasticizers affect hormone systems, and some phthalates have even larger pathways of disruption. Phthalates and BPA have been proven to affect development and reproduction in a variety of species. Disturbances include changes in the number of offspring produced and reduced hatching success. In amphibians for example, phthalates and BPA disrupt thyroid functioning which in turn impacts larval development. Molluscs, crustaceans and amphibians appear to be more responsive than fish, with most effects being induced in low concentration ranges with the exception of disrupted spermatogenesis in fish in the low range. A Phthalate referred to as diethyl phthalate (DEP) enters the aquatic environment through industries that manufacture cosmetics, plastics and many commercial products that pose hazards to aquatic organisms and human health. Through exposing an adult male common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) to LC50 doses it was evident that a bioaccumulation of DEP in testis, liver, brain, gills and muscle tissue was present. Fish exposed to 20 ppm of DEP became drowsy and discolored during the onset of the fourth week. Sources of DEP contamination and accumulation in humans include cosmetic products and dietary meat of fish, Persky et al. This DEP acts as a cosmetic ingredient and vehicle for fragrances, both which come in contact with the skin. Many countries around the world including India practice sewage fed fisheries where waste waters are used for the purpose of culturing fish. Endocrine disruption and a presence of phthalate residue is highly likely to be observable in these sewage fed fish. This is the case as waste water from various industries and garbage containing DEP are released into these waters. Through a DEP treatment with Cyprinus carpio, liver size was observed to increase and testis size decreased. In fish, muscle ALT and AST activities decreased as it was effected by DEP treatment. Like many toxic chemicals DEP has been known to affect metabolic enzyme profiles and activities of phosphatases and transaminases, Ghorpade et al. as cited by. A decrease in immunity of M. rosenbergii after exposure to DEP was also noted. Given that biological effect concentrations for plasticizers used in the laboratory coincide with concentrations present in the environment, it seems that some wildlife species must be negatively impacted.  Personal hygiene products  Personal care products can reach the environment through drainage from waste water treatment plants and digested sludge. Recently, the anti- dandruff and antimycotic, Climbazole, was detected in waste water treatment drainages. Climbazole is readily used in cosmetics, and is an ingredient in anti-dandruff shampoos. Shampoos contain formulations of up to 2.0% which is the equivalent of approximately 15g/L. Climbazole is classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. It affects the growth of green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata at very low concentrations. Zebrafish experienced lethal effects after exposure to climbazole in laboratory testing. Effects included thickening of fertilized eggs, lack of somite formation, lack of detachment of the tail bud from the yolk sac, and lack of a heartbeat were evaluated after 48 hours. Along with Danio rerio, Lemna minor, Navicula pelliculosa, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, and Daphnia magna were tested and all were found to be negatively affected by climbazole in a concentration-dependent manner with highest toxicity observed in L. minor. Effects included stunted colony growth and darkening in color. Effects of climbazole on oats and turnip included retarded, stunted growth of the leaves and shoot as well as turning darker in color. The aquatic ecotoxicity of climbazole can be classified as very toxic to Lemna and algae, toxic to fish and harmful to Daphnia.  Pesticides  Pesticides often pose serious problems as they kill not only targeted organisms but also non-targeted organisms in the process. They are released into the natural environment intentionally by people who are often unaware that the chemicals will travel further than anticipated, Hatakeyama et al. as cited in. Thus the pesticides largely affect the natural communities in which they are used. They negatively effect multiple levels ranging from molecules to tissues to organs to individuals to populations and onto communities. In the natural environment, a combination of pesticide exposure and natural stressors such as fluctuating temperature, food shortage or decreased oxygen availability are worse than when presented alone. Pesticides can affect the feeding rates of zoo-plankton. In the presence of pesticides zoo-plankton display lower feeding rates which result in reduced growth and reproduction. Swimming may also be affected by pesticides which poses a life- threatening issue for zoo-plankton as they swim to obtain food and nutrients and avoid predators. Such changes may alter predator-prey relationships. A spinning behavior became apparent in Daphnia induced by carbaryl which increased the probability of the Daphnia being eaten by other fish, Dodson et al. as cited by. The toxicant pentachlorophenol increases swimming speed in the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, in turn increasing the encounter rate of the prey with their predators, Preston et al. as cited by.  Oil spills  One of the major environmental impacts of oil exploration on the environment is the contamination of aquatic ecosystems from oil spills and oil seepages from pits. Oftentimes, as is the case in the Ecuadorian Amazon, oil is used to control dust on roadways, causing the precipitation runoff from these roads to also be contaminated. Direct human health hazards occur since many people, including children walk barefoot on these oiled roads putting them in direct contact with the crude oil. Other hazards to humans include seepages into ponds that provide drinking water for the population. During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Environmental concerns are primarily focused on a group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). ‚ÄúPAHs accumulate on particles and sediments, which tend to protect them from biodegrading processes\\", Green and Trett as cited in. During the exploration for oil, mud that has been drilled is deposited into pits. These production pits are often not lined risking the possibility for contaminants to leak into the surrounding environment. Samples were collected from four sites (13 stations) in the Ecuadorian Amazon where crude oil was the main pollutant. The water collected from Site B, a drinking water pond located 100m from an in use pit, had the highest total petroleum hydrocarbon (THP) concentration. Sediments were found to be acutely phototoxic. This area which has poorly developed infrastructure is one where residents collect water for drinking, cooking and bathing from the rivers and ponds nearby. ‚ÄúA recent study observed excess cancer rates in a village in this region‚Äù Sebastian et. Al, as cited in. Not only were excess cancer rates apparent but many people in this area that were consuming the water for drinking purposes became ill. In Wernersson's study, toxicity of water and sediment samples were studied on Daphnia magna (a crustacean zoo-plankton species) and Hyalella azteca (an amphipod). These samples were collected from four sites where crude oil was the main source of pollution. 1-4 day old organisms of both species were used in the tests. Immobility of D. magna was recorded after 24 hours of exposure indoors. They were then moved outdoors where they were exposed to sunlight. After 1‚Äì2 hours the samples were removed from the sunlight and it was found that D. Magna often recovered within an hour after UV exposure. Hyalella azteca was cultured in the same medium as was used for the D. Magna species. To minimize stress shade was provided. 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness were provided.

During 1946 to 1949 he took part as a conscript in the military actions to reestablish rule in the Dutch East Indies. During that time he became interested in the avian family Zosteropidae, comprising the white-eyes. Mees was born at Bloemendaal in the Netherlands. He was introduced to natural history by his parents and was introduced to birds by his uncle Jan Verwey. He attended the University of Leiden where he studied biology, obtaining his doctorate in 1956 with a break in Java as part of the Dutch forces during the Indonesian war of independences. It was during his time in Java that he took a special interest in white-eyes (Zosterops) and also an introduction to George Junge. During 1953-54 he visited Trinidad and Tobago and collected bird specimens. He was an assistant at the department birds of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden from May 1955 to June 1957. His doctoral thesis was on the Indo- Australian Zosteropidae. Thereafter he became Curator of Vertebrates at the Western Australian Museum from 1958 to 1963. While in Australia he met and married Veronica.

Aria alnifolia), also called alder-leafed whitebeam, Korean whitebeam, or Korean mountain ash, , is a species of whitebeam native to eastern Asia in eastern and northern China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan.  Description  Sorbus alnifolia is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to 10‚Äì20 m tall with a trunk up to 30 cm diameter and grey bark; the crown is columnar or conic in young trees, becoming rounded with age, with branches angled upwards, and slender shoots. The leaves are green above, and thinly hairy with white hairs beneath, 5‚Äì10 cm long and 3‚Äì6 cm broad, simple, usually unlobed (but see varieties, below), broadest near the base, with serrated margins and an acute apex. The autumn colour is orange-pink to red. The flowers are 10‚Äì18 mm diameter, with five white petals and 20 yellowish-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 4‚Äì8 cm diameter in late spring. The fruit is a globose pome 8‚Äì15 mm diameter, bright red, with a dimple at the apex; they are mature in mid autumn.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins . There are three varieties: *Sorbus alnifolia var. alnifolia. Leaves unlobed. Throughout the range of the species. *Sorbus alnifolia var. angulata S.B.Liang. Leaves weakly lobed; fruit oblong. Northeast China, Korea. *Sorbus alnifolia var. lobulata Rehder. Leaves weakly lobed; fruit globose. Shandong Province. It has sometimes been placed in a separate genus of its own as Micromeles alnifolia, differing from other whitebeams in the deciduous sepals on the fruit (persistent in other whitebeams), but genetic evidence places it close to Sorbus aria. Cultivation and uses It is occasionally grown as an ornamental tree in northern Europe, primarily for its autumn colour. The cultivar 'Skyline' has been selected for its fastigiate growth.

Description Jupiter Column pillars express the religious beliefs of their time. They were erected in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, mostly near Roman settlements or villas in the Germanic provinces. Some examples also occur in Gaul and Britain. The base of the monuments was normally formed by a Vierg√∂tterstein (four gods stone), in itself a common monument type, usually depicting Juno, Minerva, Mercury, and Hercules.Woolf, pp. 117, 128. This would support a Wocheng√∂tterstein (a carving depicting the personifications of the seven days of the week), which, in turn, supported a column or pillar, normally decorated with a scale pattern.Woolf, p. 117. The column was crowned with a statue of Jupiter, usually on horseback, trampling a Giant (usually depicted as a snake). In some cases, such as at Walheim, the column capital is decorated with four heads, usually interpreted as depictions of the four times of day (morning, midday, evening, night). The total height of a Jupiter Column is normally around 4 meters, but some examples are taller, including a famous example at Mainz with a height of more than 9 meters. The columns in Upper Germany normally depict Jupiter defeating a Giant, as described above, and are thus known as Jupitergigantens√§ulen (\\"Jupiter-Giant-Columns\\"). In Lower Germany, Jupiter is normally depicted enthroned without the Giant; those monuments are commonly described simply as Jupiters√§ulen (\\"Jupiter Columns\\"). The pillars were often placed within a walled enclosure and accompanied by an altar. No such monument has survived intact. They are known from excavated finds or from secondary use as spolia used in the construction of Christian churches. Recently, reconstructions of some Jupiter Columns have been erected at or near where they were found, such as at Ladenburg, Obernburg, Benningen am Neckar, Sinsheim, Stuttgart, Mainz, and near the Saalburg. According to the historian Greg Woolf, the pillars depict the victory of Jupiter Optimus Maximus over the forces of Chaos, the god himself being raised high above the other gods and humankind, but closely linked with them.Woolf, pp. 126-27. Woolf sees most such monuments as dedications by individuals.Woolf, pp. 121-126. References  Bibliography  * Die Iupiters√§ulen in den germanischen Provinzen. Rheinland-Verlag, K√∂ln 1981.

It opened in 1883 and closed in 1933. Route This long line was situated entirely within County Tyrone, linking the market town of Castlederg through Spamount, Crew and Fyfin to Victoria Bridge (a junction with the main line of the Great Northern Railway (Ireland)). The line followed the course of the road for almost its entire length, and there were passing loops at Spamount and Crew. Early years The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) reached Victoria Bridge in 1852. Plans for a narrow gauge rail link to Castlederg were agreed at a public meeting held in the town in August 1881. The line was constructed shortly prior to the enactment of the Tramways Act 1883, and opened in April 1883, so the promoters lost out on any financial assistance from the government. Because of a sharp gradient on the approach to Victoria Bridge, all trains had to be equipped with a Westinghouse continuous braking system - the first trains in Ireland to be so equipped. The line's first two steam locomotives were fitted with enclosed bodywork as tram engines. Throughout its operation, the line was normally served by three return workings every day (except Sundays), with an additional service on Fridays and Castlederg Fair days. It started with two Kitson tramway type 0-4-0T locomotives, but these were both gone by 1912. A third improved Kitson tram locomotive was acquired in 1891, this was withdrawn in 1928. Final years A 24-seat railcar was built with a Fordson paraffin engine in 1925 at Castlederg. Although basic in design, it was capable of being driven from either end and the driver also sold the tickets. From 1925 the Tramway became loss making, reaching virtual insolvency by 1932. A strike disrupted Northern Ireland's rail network between 31 January and 7 April 1933. This was taken as an opportunity to discontinue services. The last steam engine departed from Castlederg on 27 July 1934 hauling redundant rolling stock to Victoria Bridge for auction. The need for transhipment of all freight at the break of gauge between the Tramway and the gauge Great Northern Railway at Victoria Bridge was time-consuming, inefficient and expensive. By the 1930s the railway's Victorian-era infrastructure was also in need of substantial investment. The line became one of Northern Ireland's earliest casualties of road competition. At the end in 1933, there was a Hudswell Clarke 2-6-0T locomotive (sold to Clogher Valley Railway), a Hudswell Clarke 0-4-4T locomotive and a Beyer-Peacock Isle of Man type 2-4-0T locomotive which had come from the Ballymena and Larne Railway.

He won his only international cap for the Republic of Ireland national football team on 18 May 1960 when he replaced Noel Dwyer at half time in a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Sweden in Malm√∂. Swan also went on to play for Finn Harps before retiring in the early 1970s. His well-known football-playing nephews are Tony McDonnell and Derek Swan. After his professional playing career ended, Swan started a career in the Irish film industry as an electrician, eventually becoming one of Ireland's most successful head electricians, or gaffer, on many TV productions, commercials, music videos, films, and documentaries. All three of his children, Jeannette, Sean and Niall, played in Tolka Park, the legendary home of Drumcondra FC, in cup finals for the Drumcondra amateur and junior sides of the 1980s and 1990s. His Son Niall started a football company in the U.S. In 2002. Maurice is an avid golfer and a West Ham United fan.

The Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902) involved a global logistics effort to provide that which is needed as part of any military action, as well as, the local conditions that require out of the area resources be imported due, as in the case with southern Africa, the limited amount available from local sources or the loss of local sources due to the hostilities. According to the contemporary military writer, Alfred Thayer Mahan, the \\"transportation\\" required by the war in South Africa was \\"an incident unprecedented, and in its success unsurpassed, in military history.\\"Mahan, 1900: 85. Overview Animals were an important part of the supply load, drawn from across the British Empire as well as Europe and the Americas. 360,000 horses out of a total of 519,000, had to be shipped into South Africa. 106,000 mules and donkeys out of a total of 151,000 were also brought into the region for the war. Food was brought from Britain. The British drew upon food reserves that were kept at Woolwich, London, prior to the war. By 30 September 1900, 298,000 water bottles, 41,000 camp kettles, and 384,000 bars of soap had been purchased in Britain and sent to South Africa. With the collieries of the Transvaal unavailable and those of Natal under enemy occupation, there were limited stocks of coal in South Africa. The naval base at Simon's Town near Cape Town had only a reserve of 13,000 tons at the start of the war. Much of this too had to be transported from Britain. Construction material was sent. Enough was shipped to rebuild destroyed railway bridges along the whole length of the Orange Free State. 118,000 rifles, 8,500 carbines, and 2,300 pistols were sent out between 1 June 1899 and the end of the war. Accompanying these were 139 million rounds of small arms ammunition.Webb, 2007: 297, 299. With South Africa located 6,000 miles from Britain, the logistics needs of the war put its shipping under strain. This was despite the country possessing the world's largest merchant marine fleet. As a result, the British attempted to obtain as much as possible from within the region. 159,000 horses were sourced from within South Africa, as were 45,000 mules and donkeys. Trek oxen were almost entirely locally sourced. 150,000 were used in the first 15 months. The British bought 2,163 wagons and carts with the Cape Colony and Natal during the war as well hiring a further 1,400 ox wagons up to March 1900. Local companies were contracted as suppliers, principal of which was Julius Weil. Orders for railway rolling stock were placed within South Africa. Manufacture was carried out at Salt River in Cape Town, Uitenhage outside Port Elizabeth, and East London.Webb, 2007: 297. Much food was also bought locally. The supply of meat to the troops at the Cape was contracted out to the South African Cold Storage Company. The British also grew and raised their own locally produced food. During the guerrilla phase of the war they took control of 70 vacant Boer farms for this purpose. Even land around blockhouses and lines of communication was cultivated.

Biography Born in Copenhagen in Denmark in 1904, Loewenstein studied at a business school in Switzerland and a rabbinical seminary in Amsterdam, Netherlands. During his youth he became involved in the European Agudat Yisrael youth movement, of which he later became chairman. After immigrating to Mandatory Palestine in 1934, he remained active in Agudat Yisrael. As a prominent member of the organisation, Loewenstein became a member of Moetzet HaAm (later the Provisional State Council), and signed Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. However, he later claimed: :It ignored our sole right to Eretz Israel, which is based on the covenant of the Lord with Abraham, our father, and repeated promises in the Tanach. It ignored the aliya of the Ramban and the students of the Vilna Gaon and the Ba'al Shem Tov, and the [rights of] Jews who lived in the 'Old Yishuv'.Wallish and the Declaration of Independence Jerusalem Post, 1998 (republished on Eretz Israel Forever) He was elected to the Knesset in the country's first elections in 1949 as a member of the United Religious Front, an alliance of the four major religious parties. However, he lost his seat in the 1951 elections. Loewenstein rejected the idea of a constitution for Israel, stating that: :\\"if it contradicts the Torah of Israel, it is a revolt against the Almighty; if it is identical with the Torah, it is superfluous. A constitution will lead to an uncompromising fight... a Kulturkampf.\\"Perpetual Dilemma: Jewish Religion in the Jewish State S.

Origins of this Rite  The Rite was mainly elaborated by Jean-Baptiste Willermoz. This famous Mason reformed the French branch of the Rite of Strict Observance at the Congress of Gauls in 1778, including some items coming from the Elect Cohen Order and denying the Templar legacy. This date may be considered as the birth of the Rectified Scottish Rite. It came from several initiatory systems of the 18th century: * The Order of Knight Masons of the Elect Cohens of the Universe, of Martines de Pasqually, * The Templar Strict Observance, Knight Masonry born in Germany in the middle of the 18th century then spread in the rest of Europe, * Scottish Masonry (all the existing higher degrees, when it was not yet structured), * Craft Masonry in 3 degrees (entered apprentice, fellowcraft, master mason) as it was in use in French Freemasonry (Grand Orient de France) at this time and that became the French Rite. It might be noted that during this period, the Grand Orient of France was still in regularity and amity with English Freemasons, and there exists some evidence to suggest that English Masons, living in France, may have also introduced or practised some early ritual forms of degrees which are now constituted in the York Rite. In fact, many Grand Orient lodges practised at least the Mark Master and Royal Arch degrees, either as \\"side degrees\\" or as portions of the second and third craft degrees respectively. (UGLE Series Lecture, 22 OCT 1997) If these were present, they ceased to be included with historical Rectified Scottish Rite practices after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, when the rite took its sojourn in Switzerland. The evolution and transformation of this system during the 1778 (Lyon) and 1782 (Wilhelmsbad) congresses created the Rectified Scottish Rite in 1782. Since then, rituals have remained the same, except the possible removal of the \\"York\\" influences just seven years later as mentioned above. It is a Christian rite which contains the doctrine of the Trait√© de la r√©int√©gration des √™tres, Martines de Pasqually's major book.

Oxpheneridine is not currently used in medicine. Presumably it has similar effects to other opioid derivatives, such as analgesia, sedation, nausea and respiratory depression. Unlike most opioid derivatives, oxpheneridine is not specifically listed as an illegal drug. In the UNODC narcotics report of 1958, they state that it was not possible to administer oxpheneridine in high doses as it is poorly soluble and highly irritating, and at the low doses administered it did not produce addiction in animals. This appears to be the only time oxpheneridine has been investigated, and so its pharmacological properties have not been well established. Oxpheneridine would probably be regarded as a controlled substance analogue of pethidine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand. In Canada, Oxpheneridine is specifically excluded from the illegal drugs list on the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act schedules, presumably on the basis of the lack of addictive potential found by the UNODC.

The title translates roughly to \\"The Mysterious Records of Immovable Wisdom\\". The book is a series of three discourses addressed to samurai but applicable to everyone who desires an introduction to Zen philosophy, the book makes little use of Buddhist terminology and instead focuses on describing situations followed by an interpretation. Its contents make an effort to apply Zen Buddhism to martial arts. Chapters All three chapters/essays are addressed to the samurai class, and all three seek to unify the spirit of Zen with the spirit of the sword. Of the three essays in the treatise, two were letters: * Fud≈çchishinmy≈çroku, \\"The Mysterious Record of Immovable Wisdom\\", written to Yagy≈´ Munenori, head of the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ school of swordsmanship and teacher to two generations of sh≈çguns; and * Taiaki, \\"Annals of the Sword Taia\\", (Â§™ÈòøË®ò) written perhaps to Munenori or possibly to Ono Tadaaki, head of the Itt≈ç school of swordsmanship and an official instructor to the sh≈çguns family and close retainers. Individually and broadly speaking, one could say that Fud≈çchishinmy≈çroku deals with technique, how the self is related to the Self during confrontation, and how an individual may become a unified whole.

In 1985, he was given a chance in the Football League when he was signed by Fulham, managing to make an impact on the first team before an injury meant he lost his place in the side and, after finding himself unable to force his way back into the squad, was loaned out to his hometown side Cardiff City. He enjoyed a fairly successful spell at Cardiff but an injury crisis at Fulham saw him recalled. In 1989, he returned to Cardiff City, this time on a permanent basis. At the club he established a striking partnership with Carl Dale and the two competed for the club's top scorer award at the club for several years, with Pike winning the award for three consecutive seasons between 1989 and 1992, the third season sharing it with Dale. He left the club in 1993 having played over 150 League games for the Bluebirds, to sign for Hereford United. While playing for Hereford United in 1993 he scored a hat- trick against Colchester United, in which each of the three goals was scored past a different goalkeeper.

Their exploits, embellished, inspired the Byzantine \\"national epic\\" of Digenes Akritas and the cycle of the Acritic songs. The term is derived from the Greek word akron/akra, meaning border; similar border guards, the limitanei, were employed in the late Roman and early Byzantine armies to guard the frontiers (limes). In official Byzantine use, the term is non-technical, and used in a descriptive manner, being generally applied to the defenders as well as the inhabitants of the eastern frontier zone, including their Muslim counterparts. The popular image of the Akritoi has been heavily influenced by their portrayal in the Acritic songs, and refers to the military troops stationed along the Empire's border. In reality, the Byzantine troops stationed along the edges of the Empire were a mixture of professional troops and local thematic militia, as well as irregular units that constituted the Akritai or Apelatai proper. These were light infantry recruited from Armenians and the native Byzantine population. By the late 10th century, the reconquest of much territory in the East meant that the latter were often ethnically and religiously mixed, a fact epitomized by the legendary Digenes Akritas: \\"digenes\\" means \\"of two races\\", i.e. \\"Roman\\" (Byzantine/Greek) and \\"Saracen\\". The Apelatai, whose role and tactics are described in Nikephoros II Phokas' De velitatione bellica, acted as raiders, scouts and border guards in the perennial border warfare between Byzantium and its eastern neighbors, characterized by skirmishes and raids. Aside from light infantry, the border forces were complemented by the light cavalry called trapezitai or tasinarioi. In case of a major Arab raid (razzia), they were supposed to raise the alarm, assist in the evacuation of the local population to the various strongholds, and shadow and harass the enemy force until reinforcements could arrive. Many of the Akritai were members of the separated Armenian church and most of them gave protection to heretics.The Fall of Constantinople 1453, Steven Runciman, page 23 Often, they were active as brigands as well ‚Äì they were known as chonsarioi, from the Bulgarian for \\"thieves\\", in the Balkans, and in the epic of Digenes, the apelatai are brigands. Whether these men were also given military estates like the other thematic soldiers to cultivate or lived on rents from smallholdings while concentrating on their military duties is still a matter of debate. Their officers however were drawn from the local aristocracy. The Akritai declined in importance by the late 10th century, as the Byzantine conquests pushed the border eastwards, and its defense radically restructured, with smaller themata grouped in five large regional commands headed by a doux and a heavy presence of professional troops (tagmata). During the first half of the 11th century, the Byzantines faced little danger in the East, and allowed their military strength to weaken. As a result, they were unable to halt the quick advance of the Seljuk Turks in Asia Minor. The institution, in the form of a force raised by local inhabitants in exchange for land and tax exemptions, was re-established under Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180), when he reorganized the themes in the reconquered western portion of Asia Minor. It is also attested during the Empire of Nicaea, guarding the Anatolian frontier, especially around the Meander valley, against the incursions of Turkish nomads. Their attachment to the Laskarid dynasty however led them to revolt against the usurper emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos in 1262. After the revolt was suppressed, the akritai were then enrolled into the regular army, and their exemptions were annulled. As a result, within a generation, they had effectively ceased to exist, opening the way to the complete loss of the Byzantine possessions in Asia Minor during the first half of the 14th century.

Mount Vesuvius is to the far left. The Temple of Apollo is a Roman temple built in 120 BC and dedicated to the Greek and Roman god Apollo in the ancient Roman town of Pompeii, southern Italy. Located in the forum (market place) and facing the northern side of the town, it is the town's most important religious building and has ancient origins. The cult of Apollo, imported from Greece, was widespread in Campania, and from excavations in the temple's vicinity has been shown to have been present in Pompeii since the 6th century BC. The sanctuary's present appearance dates from its 2nd-century BC rebuild, and a further reconstruction to repair damage from the 62 earthquake, repairs which were left incomplete at the time of the eruption. The temple, in the center of a sacred enclosure, was surrounded on all four sides by a wide series of tuff columns from Nocera, originally grooved and with Ionic capitals, that were being replaced with stucco columns and Corinthian capitals painted in yellow, red and dark blue. Plan of the temple The elegant Doric architrave of metopes and triglyphs resting on the columns was transformed into a continuous frieze with griffins, festoons and foliage. Today, the remains of the temple front appear as they originally did, since almost all of this transformation in plaster has disappeared. Some statues of a deity have been recovered, facing the columns of the portico, and are now in the National Archeological Museum of Naples, though copies of two of them ‚Äì one representing Apollo, the other a bust of Diana ‚Äì have been placed where the originals were found. The temple itself, a peripteros with 48 Ionic columns, was on a high podium and entered up an imposing set of steps, in a fusion of Greek and Italic architectural ideas. Unusually, the cella is sited further back with respect to the peristyle. In front of the steps may still be seen a white marble altar on a travertine base, with a Latin inscription giving the names of the quattuorviri who dedicated it. To side of the steps is an Ionic column that supported a sundial. In the side of the perimeter wall of the Temple of Apollo, facing onto the town's forum, a niche is extracted containing the mensa ponderaria; the table with the town's official measures, to guarantee the citizen against fraudulent shopkeepers and merchandise.

Usage is primarily focused on allowing exploration and construction of alternative physical computer interaction systems, but have most notably been adopted by music enthusiasts, as they greatly simplify musical instrument mods and creation of novel electronic musical instruments, MIDI controllers and audio control surfaces (such as presented at NIME), e.g. for electronic music generation, and visual artists, as they greatly simplify interactive installation art and electronic art (such as presented at Ars Electronica and SIGGRAPH).

I-CubeX is designed and produced by Infusion Systems.  History  I-CubeX arose out of a research project in 1995The I-Cube System: moving towards sensor technology for artists directed by Axel Mulder at the Department of Kinesiology, Simon Fraser University to address the need for better tools for artists to create interactive art and for musicians to more easily create or modify musical instruments. It was inspired by projects such as STEIM's Sensorlab. While I-CubeX helped opening up access to technology for artists interested in sensor technology, it in itself inspired others to create new technology. The field evolved into physical computing and it was followed by the creation of a number of other generic platforms for applying sensor technology in the (performing) arts such as Arduino, as well as the development of very application specific sensors for human interfacing and human interface devices. While the focus of I-CubeX technology was initially on translating sensor signals to MIDI (Digitizer, microDig) for music enthusiasts, the transmission protocols now include Bluetooth Low Energy (WiDig), Bluetooth Classic (Wi-microDig) and USB (WiDig, USB-microDig) so as to facilitate its use by all kinds of researchers and engineers, as well as MIDI.

Early life He was born in January 1783 in the parish of St Peter in the East, Oxford, second son of Dr James Bandinel by his wife Margaret, n√©e Dumaresq. Career He entered the Foreign Office as a Clerk in 1799 and became Superintendent of the Slave Trade Department. In 1807, Parliament voted to abolish the slave trade, and in 1833 slavery itself was abolished in the British Empire. Bandinel's role was to supervise its suppression. From 1824 to his retirement in 1841, he received an annual allowance from Parliament, together with a lump sum of ¬£1000, raised from the sale of condemned slave ships. Marriage and family Bandinel married, in 1813, Marian Eliza, daughter of Rev Dr Robert Hunter of Okeford Fitzpaine, Dorset. The pair separated under two years later and their young son, James, spent his childhood in six-month stays with each parent. Philanthropy Bandinel was a lifelong benefactor. He was instrumental in the construction of the Thames Tunnel (1828) through his close friendship with‚Äîand financial support of‚ÄîMarc Isambard Brunel. In 1845, he provided land for the construction and endowment of a parish church at Melplash, Dorset. It had been an unfulfilled wish of his father to see the church built, and Bandinel saw it through to completion; the dedication ceremony was in 1846. He also donated land for a village school and schoolhouse. Death Bandinel died on 29 July 1849 at his house in 19 Berkeley Square, Mayfair, London. He had contracted Asian cholera while staying in Salisbury. He was buried in the old St George's Hanover Square burial ground on Bayswater Road, London.

Plot summary Although Arran Handully is the most popular lifeloop (reality show) actress on the planet Capitol she is sick of acting and wants to retire. Her manager tells her of an idea that for one last lifeloop that will make her rich enough to quit. She suggests that Arran do a nonstop loop from the time she wakes up from suspended animation to the time she goes back to sleep using the fictional drug Somec twenty-one days later. Arran reluctantly agrees to this because she really wants to quit. On the last day of filming a famous lifeloop actor named Hamilton Ferlock comes to her apartment. Shortly after arriving he breaks character, tells her that he loves her and asks her to marry him. She assumes that he is just doing this to play a trick on her and rejects him very coldly before going to the Sleeproom to be put under Somec. When she wakes up she finds out that Hamilton committed suicide a week after she went to sleep. She also discovers that she really cared for him.

Hasan achieved fame in Syria through a number of highly acclaimed and extremely successful Syrian series most notably Saladin, Taifas and Nizar Qabbani. Taking on the title role in the Egyptian series King Farouk, Hassan's latest role has established him as one of the leading stars in the Arab world. He appeared perennially with Hatem Ali, one of Syria's leading directors, in a majority of his series such as The Philanderer Salem (2000), Saladin (2001), Taifas (2005) and King Farouk (2007), a role that earned him a best actor's award by Egyptian audiences and critics and earned him vast recognition and success and established him as one of the leading actors of his generation. He has also starred in The Waiting (2006). He is best known for his role as Abboud, a man who does not have a family, and he loved and cared for by the people of his new town. Life and career Taim Hasan, originally from Al-Shaykh Badr, was born on February 17, 1976, in Tartus, Syria's second-largest port city. By the age of 4 or 5, he moved with his family to Damascus. He comes from a middle- class Syrian family that had no prior connection with the film business. His father, who finished his education in Germany, is a German language teacher whereas his mother is an Arabic language teacher. On July 1, 2004, he married the Syrian actress Dima Bayaa and they have two children named Ward and Fahad. He has confirmed that when he first applied to the Higher Institute of Dramatic Arts, he was rejected. However, when he applied for the second time in front of a committee headed by the Syrian actor Jamal Suliman, who was able to see the high potential and promise in Hassan, he was accepted. Since his graduation from the High Institute for Dramatic Arts in 2001, Hassan was able to establish himself through taking influential roles in some of the most renowned Syrian television series. His first remembered role came in the year 2000 (while still completing his degree at the High Institute for Dramatic Arts) in the Syrian series The Philanderer Salem directed by Syrian director Hatem Ali. In the following year, Hassan took on his breakthrough role in the series Saladin also directed by Hatem Ali in which Hassan played the role of \\"the Fatimid Caliph Al-Aded Ledin Allah\\". By the year 2006, Hassan has starred in a number of Syrian series with some of Syria's most renowned and respected actors such as Jamal Suliman and Ayman Zidan. Upon completing his role in the series \\"Along Days\\", a romantic drama in which he played the leading role, Hassan was approached to take on the title role of King Farouk, a major project in Egypt. Though this was not the first time that Hassan is offered the title role of a major historic figure, as he played the role of Syria's most famous poet, Nizar Qabbani, in the series \\"Nizar Qabbani\\" in 2005. It has been later reported that Hassan was actually approached after a number of other Egyptian actors have turned down the role of Farouk. Not only was Hassan able to save a project that Dr. Lamis Gaber has spent the last 15 years of her life researching and writing, but he together with a team was able to turn it into a drama. In taking on the role of Farouk, Hassan who shares a resemblance to the Egyptian king, allegedly had to shave his hair during the four and a half months of shooting in addition to wearing a body-suit and heavy makeup to resemble Farouk in his final years on the throne. On December 6, 2007, Hassan received the Gold Medal in the Best Actor's Award category shared with Egyptian actor Yehia El-Fakharany at the Cairo Festival for Arab Media for playing the title role in the 2007 Ramadan Egyptian hit television series \\"King Farouk\\". Hasan's last television series, which was filmed in Morocco and Syria entitled Conflict on the Sand‚Äîa title that was changed from Days of Revenge‚Äîwas released for worldwide broadcast in Ramadan of 2008 and was seen by many commentators as a revival of Beduin series in Arabic drama. The television series, a Beduin epic that takes place in the Gulf Beduin desert at the beginning of the 18th century, also starred Jordanian actress Saba Mubarak and Syrian actors Muna Wassef, Abdel Moneim Al Amayri, Hasan Awaytti and Basil Khayyat and is directed by Hatem Ali and written by Hany al-Saady. The series was produced by Dubai Media Incorporated in collaboration with Picture for Media Productions, a Syrian production company owned by renowned Syrian director Hatem Ali. Its estimated cost was over $6 million and it was based on the vision and poetry of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Hasan has recently finished filming his first cinematic role in Egypt entitled Mecano, which is scheduled for worldwide release on January 28, 2009. The movie also stars Lebanese actress, Nour, and Egyptian actor, Khaled El Sawi. This psycho- drama tells the story of a young architect, who is suffering from a rare disease that affects his short-term memory and who falls in love with Amira (played by Nour) who helps him overcome his ordeal. Taim is the lead character in the hit Lebanese series Al Hayba which features many well known Arab celebrities such as Nadine Nassib Njeim, Muna Wassef, and Valerie Abou Chacra.

Before the IBM PC's introduction  Before the IBM PC was introduced, the personal computer market was dominated by systems using the 6502 and Z80 8-bit microprocessors, such as the TRS 80, Commodore PET, and Apple II series, which used proprietary operating systems, and by computers running CP/M. After IBM introduced the IBM PC, it was not until 1984 that IBM PC and clones became the dominant computers.From Altair to iPad 35 years of personal computer market share Ars Technica, October 2012 In 1983, Byte forecast that by 1990, IBM would command only 11% of business computer sales. Commodore was predicted to hold a slim lead in a highly competitive market, at 11.9%. Around 1978, several 16-bit CPUs became available. Examples included the Data General mN601, Fairchild's 9440, the Ferranti F100-L, the General Instrument CP1600 and CP1610, the National Semiconductor INS8900, Panafacom's MN1610, Texas Instruments' TMS9900, and, most notably, the Intel 8086. These new processors were expensive to incorporate in personal computers, as they used a 16-bit data bus and needed rare (and thus expensive) 16-bit peripheral and support chips. More than 50 new business-oriented personal computer systems came on the market in the year before IBM released the IBM PC. Very few of them used a 16- or 32-bit microprocessor, as 8-bit systems were generally believed by the vendors to be perfectly adequate, and the Intel 8086 was too expensive to use. The editors asked 17 personal computer executives \\"Is 8-bit dead?\\" The response was mixed. Gary Kildall, author of the CP/M operating system, said \\"We're not too concerned that 8-bit stuff is going to die.\\" Bill Gates said \\"We need the power of the 16-bit computers for good software design.\\" Some of the main manufacturers selling 8-bit business systems during this period were: * Acorn Computers * Apple Computer Inc. * Atari Inc. * Commodore International * Cromemco * Digital Equipment Corporation * Durango Systems Inc. * Hewlett- Packard * Intersystems * Morrow Designs * North Star Computers * Ohio Scientific * Olivetti * Processor Technology * Sharp * South West Technical Products Corporation * Tandy Corporation * Zenith Data Systems/Heathkit  The IBM PC  On August 12, 1981, IBM released the IBM Personal Computer. One of the most far-reaching decisions made for IBM PC was to use an open architecture,Inventions That Built the Information Technology Revolution by Rhys McCarney \\"IBM CEO John Opel decided to use an open architecture\\" leading to a large market for third party add-in boards and applications; but finally also to many competitors all creating \\"IBM-compatible\\" machines. The IBM PC used the then-new Intel 8088 processor. Like other 16-bit CPUs, it could access up to 1 megabyte of RAM, but it used an 8-bit-wide data bus to memory and peripherals. This design allowed use of the large, readily available, and relatively inexpensive family of 8-bit-compatible support chips. IBM decided to use the Intel 8088 after first considering the Motorola 68000 and the Intel i8086, because the other two were considered to be too powerful for their needs.THE 8088, FIRST INTEL'S REALLY SUCCESSFUL CPU (JUNE 1979) ‚Äì an article about the influence of the i8088 on old-computers.com. Although already established rivals like Apple and Radio Shack had many advantages over the company new to microcomputers, IBM's reputation in business computing allowed the IBM PC architecture to take a substantial market share of business applications, and many small companies that sold IBM-compatible software or hardware rapidly grew in size and importance, including Tecmar, Quadram, AST Research, and Microsoft. As of mid-1982, three other mainframe and minicomputer companies sold microcomputers, but unlike IBM Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, and Control Data Corporation chose the CP/M operating system. Many other companies made \\"business personal computers\\" using their own proprietary designs, some still using 8-bit microprocessors. The ones that used Intel x86 processors often used the generic, non-IBM-compatible specific version of MS- DOS or CP/M-86, just as 8-bit systems with an Intel 8080 compatible CPU normally used CP/M.  The use of MS-DOS on non-IBM PC compatible x86-based systems  Within a year of the IBM PC's introduction, Microsoft licensed MS- DOS to over 70 other companies. One of the first computers to achieve 100% PC compatibility was the Compaq portable, released in November 1982; it remained the most compatible clone into 1984. When the PC did not yet dominate the market, however, most x86-based systems were not clones of the IBM PC design, but had different internal designs, like the CP/M-based 8-bit systems that preceded them. The IBM PC was difficult to obtain for several years after its introduction. Many makers of MS-DOS computers intentionally avoided full IBM compatibility because they expected that the market for what InfoWorld described as \\"ordinary PC clones\\" would decline once the shortage of real PCs ended. They feared the fate of companies that sold computers plug-compatible with IBM mainframes in the 1960s and 1970s‚Äîmany of which went bankrupt after IBM changed specifications‚Äîand believed that a market existed for personal computers with a similar selection of software to the IBM PC, but with better hardware. Even a few years after the IBM PC's introduction, manufacturers such as Digital, HP, Sanyo, Tandy, Texas Instruments, Tulip Computers, NEC, Wang Laboratories, and Xerox continued to introduce personal computers that were barely, if at all, compatible with the IBM PC, even though they used x86 processors and ran MS-DOS. They used MS-DOS the way Microsoft had originally envisioned: the same way as 8-bit systems used CP/M. They implemented standard ROM BIOS routines to achieve hardware independence as had 8080 (Z80) compatibles. So each machine had a different BIOS that, as long as software made only standard MS-DOS calls, would ensure compatibility. While Microsoft used a sophisticated installer with its DOS programs like Multiplan that provided device drivers for many non IBM PC-compatible computers, most other software vendors did not. Columbia University discussed the difficulty of having Kermit support many different clones and MS-DOS computers. Peter Norton, who earlier had encouraged vendors to write software that ran on many different computers, by early 1985 admitted‚Äîafter experiencing the difficulty of doing so while rewriting Norton Utilities‚Äîthat \\"there's no practical way for most software creators to write generic software\\". Dealers found carrying multiple versions of software for clones of varying levels of compatibility to be difficult. To get the best results out of the 8088's modest performance, many popular software applications were written specifically for the IBM PC. The developers of these programs opted to write directly to the computer's (video) memory and peripheral chips, bypassing MS-DOS and the BIOS. For example, a program might directly update the video refresh memory, instead of using MS-DOS calls and device drivers to alter the appearance of the screen. Many notable software packages, such as the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3, and Microsoft's Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0, directly accessed the IBM PC's hardware, bypassing the BIOS, and therefore did not work on computers that were even trivially different from the IBM PC. This was especially common among PC games. As a result, the systems that were not fully IBM PC-compatible couldn't run this software, and quickly became obsolete. Rendered obsolete with them was the CP/M-inherited concept of OEM versions of MS-DOS meant to run (through BIOS calls) on non IBM-PC hardware. = Cloning the PC BIOS = In 1984, Phoenix Technologies began licensing its clone of the IBM PC BIOS. The Phoenix BIOS and competitors such as AMI BIOS made it possible for anyone to market a PC compatible computer, without having to develop a compatible BIOS like Compaq. = Decline of the Intel 80186 = Although based on the i8086 and enabling the creation of relatively low-cost x86-based systems, the Intel 80186 quickly lost appeal for x86-based PC builders because the supporting circuitry inside the Intel 80186 chip was incompatible with those used in the standard PC chipset as implemented by IBM. It was very rarely used in personal computers after 1982.  Domination of the clones  = \\"Is it PC compatible?\\" = In February 1984 BYTE described how \\"the personal computer market seems to be shadowed under a cloud of compatibility: the drive to be compatible with the IBM Personal Computer family has assumed near-fetish proportions\\", which it stated was \\"inevitable in the light of the phenomenal market acceptance of the IBM PC\\". The magazine cited the announcement by North Star in fall 1983 of its first PC-compatible microcomputer. Founded in 1976, North Star had long been successful with 8-bit S-100 bus products, and had introduced proprietary 16-bit products, but now the company acknowledged that the IBM PC had become a \\"standard\\", one which North Star needed to follow. BYTE described the announcement as representative of the great impact IBM had made on the industry: The magazine expressed concern that \\"IBM's burgeoning influence in the PC community is stifling innovation because so many other companies are mimicking Big Blue\\". Admitting that \\"it's what our dealers asked for\\", Kaypro also introduced the company's first IBM compatible that year. Tandy‚Äîwhich had once had as much as 60% of the personal-computer market, but had attempted to keep technical information secret to monopolize software and peripheral sales‚Äîalso began selling non-proprietary computers; four years after its Jon Shirley predicted to InfoWorld that the new IBM PC's \\"major market would be IBM addicts\\", the magazine in 1985 similarly called the IBM compatibility of the Tandy 1000 \\"no small concession to Big Blue's dominating stranglehold\\" by a company that had been \\"struggling openly in the blood- soaked arena of personal computers\\". The 1000 was compatible with the PC but not compatible with its own Tandy 2000 MS-DOS computer. IBM's mainframe rivals, the BUNCH, introduced their own compatibles, and when Hewlett-Packard introduced the Vectra InfoWorld stated that the company was \\"responding to demands from its customers for full IBM PC compatibility\\". Mitch Kapor of Lotus Development Corporation said in 1984 that \\"either you have to be PC- compatible or very special\\". \\"Compatibility has proven to be the only safe path\\", Microsoft executive Jim Harris stated in 1985, while InfoWorld wrote that IBM's competitors were \\"whipped into conformity\\" with its designs, because of \\"the total failure of every company that tried to improve on the IBM PC\\". Customers only wanted to run PC applications like 1-2-3, and developers only cared about the massive PC installed base, so any non- compatible‚Äîno matter its technical superiority‚Äîfrom a company other than Apple failed for lack of customers and software. Compatibility became so important that Dave Winer joked that year (referring to the PC AT's incomplete compatibility with the IBM PC), \\"The only company that can introduce a machine that isn't PC compatible and survive is IBM\\". By 1985, the shortage of IBM PCs had ended, causing financial difficulties for many vendors of compatibles; nonetheless, Harris said, \\"The only ones that have done worse than the compatibles are the noncompatibles\\". The PC standard was similarly dominant in Europe, with Honeywell Bull, Olivetti, and Ericsson selling compatibles and software companies focusing on PC products. By the end of the year PC Magazine stated that even IBM could no longer introduce a rumored proprietary, non- compatible operating system. Noting that the company's unsuccessful PCjr's \\"cardinal sin was that it wasn't PC compatible\\", the magazine wrote that \\"backward compatibility [with the IBM PC] is the single largest concern of hardware and software developers. The user community is too large and demanding to accept radical changes or abandon solutions that have worked in the past.\\" Within a few years of the introduction of fully compatible PC clones, almost all rival business personal computer systems, and alternate x86 using architectures, were gone from the market. Despite the inherent dangers of an industry based on a de facto \\"standard\\", a thriving PC clone industry emerged. The only other non-IBM PC-compatible systems that remained were those systems that were classified as home computers, such as the Apple II series, or business systems that offered features not available on the IBM PC, such as a high level of integration (e.g., bundled accounting and inventory) or fault- tolerance and multitasking and multi-user features. = Wave of inexpensive clones = Internal view of a PC compatible computer, showing components and layout. Compaq's prices were comparable to IBM's, and the company emphasized its PC compatibles' features and quality to corporate customers. From mid-1985, what Compute! described as a \\"wave\\" of inexpensive clones from American and Asian companies caused prices to decline; by the end of 1986, the equivalent to a $1600 real IBM PC with 256K RAM and two disk drives cost as little as $600, lower than the price of the Apple IIc. Consumers began purchasing DOS computers for the home in large numbers; Tandy estimated that half of its 1000 sales went to homes, the new Leading Edge Model D comprised 1% of the US home-computer market that year, and toy and discount stores sold a clone made by Hyundai like a stereo, without a demonstrator model or salesman. Tandy and other inexpensive clones succeeded with consumers‚Äîwho saw them as superior to lower-end game machines‚Äîwhere IBM failed two years earlier with the PCjr. They were as inexpensive as home computers of a few years earlier, and comparable in price to the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, and Apple IIGS. Unlike the PCjr, clones were as fast as or faster than the IBM PC and highly compatible so users could bring work home; the large DOS software library reassured those worried about orphaned technology. Consumers used them for both spreadsheets and entertainment, with the former ability justifying buying a computer that could also perform the latter. PCs and compatibles also gained a significant share of the educational market, while longtime leader Apple lost share. At the January 1987 Consumer Electronics Show, both Commodore and Atari announced their own clones. By 1987 the PC industry was growing so quickly that the formerly business-only platform had become the largest and most important market for computer game companies, outselling games for the Apple II or Commodore 64. With the EGA video card, an inexpensive clone was better for games than the other computers. MS-DOS software was 77% of all personal computer software sold by dollar value in the third quarter of 1988, up 47% year over year. By 1989 80% of readers of Compute! owned DOS computers, and the magazine announced \\"greater emphasis on MS-DOS home computing\\". IBM's influence on the industry decreased, as competition increased and rivals introduced computers that improved on IBM's designs while maintaining compatibility. In 1986 the Compaq Deskpro 386 was the first computer based on the Intel 80386. In 1987 IBM unsuccessfully attempted to regain leadership of the market with the Personal System/2 line and proprietary MicroChannel Architecture. = Clones conquer the home = By 1990, Computer Gaming World told a reader complaining about the many reviews of PC games that \\"most companies are attempting to get their MS-DOS products out the door, first\\". It reported that MS-DOS comprised 65% of the computer- game market, with the Amiga at 10%; all other computers, including the Macintosh, were below 10% and declining. The Amiga and most others, such as the ST and various MSX2 computers, remained on the market until PC compatibles gained sufficient multimedia capabilities to compete with home computers. With the advent of inexpensive versions of the VGA video card and the Sound Blaster sound card (and its clones), most of the remaining home computers were driven from the market. By 1995, other than the Macintosh, almost no new consumer- oriented systems were sold that were not IBM PC clones. The Macintosh originally used Motorola's 68000 family of processors, later migrating to the PowerPC architecture. Throughout the 1990s Apple would steadily transition the Macintosh platform from proprietary expansion interfaces to use standards from the PC world such as IDE, PCI and USB. In 2006, Apple converted the Macintosh to the Intel x86 architecture. Modern Macintosh computers are essentially IBM PC compatibles, capable of booting Microsoft Windows and running most IBM PC- compatible software, but still retain unique design elements that support Apple's Mac OS X operating system. In 2008, Sid Meier listed the IBM PC as one of the three most important innovations in the history of video games.  Systems launched shortly after the IBM PC  Shortly after the IBM PC was released, an obvious split appeared between systems that opted to use an x86-compatible processor, and those that chose another architecture. Almost all of the x86 systems provided a version of MS-DOS. The others used many different operating systems, although the Z80-based systems typically offered a version of CP/M. The common usage of MS-DOS unified the x86-based systems, promoting growth of the x86/MS-DOS \\"ecosystem\\". As the non-x86 architectures died off, and x86 systems standardized into fully IBM PC compatible clones, a market filled with dozens of different competing systems was reduced to a near-monoculture of x86-based, IBM PC compatible, MS-DOS systems. = x86-based systems (using OEM-specific versions of MS-DOS) = Early after the launch of the IBM PC in 1981, there were still dozens of systems that were not IBM PC-compatible, but did use Intel x86 chips.search here with ms-dos as Operating System They used Intel 8088, 8086, or 80186 processors, and almost without exception offered an OEM version of MS-DOS (as opposed to the OEM version customized for IBM's use). However, they generally made no attempt to copy the IBM PC's architecture, so these machines had different I/O addresses, a different system bus, different video controllers, and other differences from the original IBM PC. These differences, which were sometimes rather minor, were used to improve upon the IBM PC's design, but as a result of the differences, software that directly manipulated the hardware would not run correctly. In most cases, the x86-based systems that didn't use a fully IBM PC compatible design didn't sell well enough to attract support from software manufacturers, though a few computer manufacturers arranged for compatible versions of popular applications to be developed and sold specifically for their machines. Fully IBM PC-compatible clones appeared on the market shortly thereafter, as the advantages of cloning became impossible to ignore. But before that some of the more notable systems that were x86-compatible, but not real clones, were: * the ACT Apricot by ACT * the Dulmont Magnum * the Epson QX-16 * the Seequa Chameleon * the HP-150 by Hewlett-Packard and the later HP 95LX, HP 100LX, HP 200LX, HP 1000CX, HP OmniGo 700LX, HP OmniGo 100, and HP OmniGo 120. * the Hyperion by Infotech Cie used its own H-DOS OEM version of MS-DOS and was, for a time, to be manufactured by Commodore as its first PC compatible. * the MBC-550 by Sanyo had many differences, including non- interchangeability of diskettes and non-standard ROM location. * the DG-One by Data General was an early laptop with full 80x25 LCD screen that could boot some generic DOSes but worked best with their OEM version of MS-DOS, and had some hardware incompatibilities (especially in the serial I-O chip) as part of the compromise to reduce power consumption. Later models were more compatible with generic PC clones. * the DG/10 by Data General had two processors, one an Intel 8086, running a very-modified version of MSDOS (alternatively: CP/M-86) in a patented closely coupled arrangement with Data General's own microECLIPSE (the 8086 \\"invisibly\\" calling the microECLIPSE whenever it needed access to some peripherals, such as disks, while the 8086 had control over other peripherals such as the screen). * the 80186-based Mindset graphics computer * the Morrow Designs' Morrow Pivot * the MZ-5500 by Sharp * the Decision Mate V from NCR Corporation; its version of MS-DOS was called NCR-DOS * the MikroMikko_2 by Nokia * the NorthStar Advantage * the PC-9801 systems from NEC * the Rainbow 100 from DEC * the RM Nimbus by RM plc * the Tandy 2000 by RadioShack * the Texas Instruments TI Professional * the Torch Graduate by Torch Computers * the Tulip System-1 by Tulip * the Victor 9000 by Sirius Systems Technology * the :YES by Philips was late on the market, ran DOS Plus and MS-DOS, but by using an 80186 it was incompatible with IBM's PC * the Z-100 by Zenith with an MS-DOS OEM version named Z-DOS = Non-x86-based systems = Not all manufacturers immediately switched to the Intel x86 microprocessor family and MS-DOS. A few companies continued releasing systems based on non-Intel architectures. Some of these systems used a 32-bit microprocessor, the most popular being the Motorola 68000. Others continued to use 8-bit microprocessors. Many of these systems were eventually forced out of the market by the onslaught of the IBM PC clones, although their architectures may have had superior capabilities, especially in the area of multimedia. The PC architectures of that era often only had a CGA display, and no other sound system than the internal PC speaker. Three systems of this era, while now extinct, have thriving legacies: * The Apple Lisa by Apple Inc. was the predecessor of the Apple Macintosh, inspiring the Macintosh's design. The original Macintosh used a Motorola 68000 chip like the Lisa, and had a sufficiently similar design that some Lisa systems were converted for sale as \\"Macintosh XL\\" computers. * The Acorn Computers Acorn Archimedes, later named the Risc PC, used a custom-designed microprocessor: the ARM. The ARM architecture continues to be popular, appearing in nearly all mobile phones and in many hand-held devices like Apple's iPhone, iPod and iPad, as well as small UNIX-based systems. The Risc PC's descendants include the A9home, the Iyonix PC and the RiscStation R7500. * The Sun Microsystems Sun-1Sun 1 info and Sun-2 families of BSD UNIX systems introduced the SunOS UNIX operating system, running on Motorola 680x0 chips. Sun's current large-scale UNIX systems use the SPARC processor family developed by Sun, but run a descendant of System V called Solaris.  Other non-x86-based systems available at the IBM PC's launch  * the 8-bit Commodore PET and CBM series * the 8-bit Atari 800 and successors * the Cromemco CS-1 * Intertec's Compustar II VPU Model 20 * the Corvus Concept * the Kaypro 10 * the Fujitsu Micro 16s * the Micro Decision by Morrow Designs * the MTU-130 by Micro Technology Unlimited * the Xerox 820 * the Epson QX-10 * the RoadRunner from MicroOffice * the TRS-80 Model II by Tandy/Radio Shack ** the following year the TRS-80 Model 12 and TRS-80 models 16 and 16e *** still later the Tandy 6000 * the TRS-80 Model III by Tandy/Radio Shack ** in April 1983, the TRS-80 Model 4 and TRS-80 Model 4P  See also  * Open architecture * Timeline of DOS operating systems * Comparison of DOS operating systems * Wintel * PC DOS * History of computing hardware (1960s‚Äìpresent) * IBM PC compatible * De facto standard * Dominant design * List of machines running CP/M  References   External links  * Dedicated to the preservation and restoration of the IBM 5150 personal computer * OLD-COMPUTERS.COM : The Museum Category:History of computing hardware Category:IBM PC compatibles ","title":"Influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market"},{"id":"14018057","text":"Antero Vipunen is a giant who appears in Finnish mythology and Kalevala folk poetry.

School Demographics Located in Astoria, Queens Public School 85 Queens is a multi-cultural community, with many small, family run businesses. The Judge Charles J. Vallone School serves approximately 450 students from Pre-kindergarten to Grade 5, coming from over forty different countries and speaking over 14 different languages. The school day is divided into 7 periods and extends from 8:10-2:30, with a 37.5 minute extended day program for small group intervention, Monday through Thursday. A ninety-minute literacy block is scheduled in every grade, every day. The Math block is 60 minutes in Grades K ‚Äì 2, and 75 minutes in Grades 3 ‚Äì 5. Thirteen and one half percent of newly admitted students are recent immigrants. One hundred and seventeen students are English Language Learners. Sixteen of the English Language Learners are Special Education students. The LABR is administered to all students new to the City system within five days of their admission. Parents and guardians of students who qualify for services are notified of the results in writing and made aware of their options. Semi-annual parent orientations are held to further clarify the program. Academic program English Language Learners at P.S. 85Q are serviced through a free-standing ESL program. In Grades K through 2 there is a self-contained ESL class on each grade. In Grades 3 through 5 a push-in program is in place. In compliance with CR Part 154, Beginning and Intermediate students receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week, and Advanced students receive 180 minutes of ESL instruction and 180 minutes of English Language Arts. The Kindergarten, First and Second Grade teachers provide two periods per day of ESL instruction during the Literacy block for Beginners and Intermediate students, and one period per day of ESL instruction with one period of English Language Arts instruction for Advanced students. The ESL teacher provides two periods per day of ESL instruction for Beginning and Intermediate students and one each of ESL and English language Arts for Advanced students. Rigby On Our Way to English is in place in self-contained classes Kindergarten through Grade 2. Rigby English in My Pocket is used supplementary in the 3 -5 push-in program. All of the teachers who service the ELLs have ESL credentials. Teachers of the self-contained ESL classes in Grades K-2 have NYS ESL certificates. The push-in ESL teacher is a licensed Spanish Bilingual teacher with ancillary ESL certification. A Special Education teacher's ESL certification is pending. This allows her to service the ELLs in her self-contained classroom. The self-contained classrooms have many Beginner/Intermediate ELLs and some Advanced ELLs, most of whom are in second grade. Within the framework of Balanced Literacy and the workshop model, social and academic language acquisition is fostered through Read Aloud, Shared, Independent and Guided Reading, and Modeled, Interactive and Independent Writing. Phonics and phonemic awareness lessons are scheduled daily. The push-in ESL program is designed to foster social and academic language acquisition while it supports the academic program. In grades 3 through 5 most of the ELLs are clustered in one class on each grade. The program in each grade is driven by the curriculum and the needs of the ELLs. Reading and Writing workshops are scheduled for 90-minute blocks. The ESL teacher pushes into each of these classes for at least one period during the literacy blocks. Collaborative planning aligns the ESL teacher's goals with the classroom programs. The ESL teacher is incorporated into the Reading workshop in grades 3 and 4 for one period each day: giving mini-lessons, leading Guided Reading groups, providing small group lessons and conferring with ELLs. Ongoing assessment drives the selection of strategy-based teaching points. Reading and language acquisition levels determine Guided reading group placement. Each group is scheduled for regular lessons. In fifth grade, where the bulk of the ELLs are long term ELLs, the emphasis is on academic language acquisition and the development of written language skills. Content area writing and projects are incorporated into the writing block to further develop spoken and written academic language. Revision and editing are scaffolded to develop standard grammar and syntax in written work. The needs of Special Education students are met in a Collaborative Team Teaching setting and is based on the inclusion model. In these classes, there are Two teachers; a general education teacher as well as a special education teacher. The two teachers collaborate on all lessons and activities to ensure that all children are learning the same content while utilizing many different approaches. Lessons are Differentiated and may be made multisensory to support those students who need information presented through different modalities. Teachers are also trained in an academic support program called Schools Attuned which was developed to target the strengths of a student and build those strengths in order for students to overcome their difficulties. Building History Building Erected in 1907, the school celebrated its 100-year anniversary, June 2007. The school was dedicated to Judge Charles J. Vallone on February 18, 1988.

Once the leading political power in Leicestershire, his family had declined in influence; regaining that position became his primary ambition and drove his political choices. During the 1679 to 1681 Exclusion Crisis, he supported the removal from the succession of the Catholic heir, James, Duke of York, before switching allegiance in 1681. James succeeded as king in 1685 with widespread support but this collapsed when his religious measures and the methods used to enforce them seemed to undermine the legal system and the Church of England. By the end of 1687, Huntingdon was one of the few non-Catholics who continued to actively implement his policies. While changing sides was common in this period, and after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, a sizeable minority continued to view James as the legitimate monarch, primacy of the Church of England was non-negotiable. Huntingdon was considered to have actively persecuted his own church, a distinction that damaged his reputation among his contemporaries. One of 30 individuals excluded from the 1690 Act of Grace, he lost his offices but continued to attend the House of Lords and remained a committed Jacobite. He was arrested and charged with treason in 1692, although charges were later dropped; shortly before his death in May 1701, he was one of five peers who voted against the 1701 Act of Settlement barring Catholics from the throne. Early life slighted in 1648 and never rebuilt Theophilus Hasting was born on 10 December 1650, fourth son of Ferdinando Hastings, 6th Earl of Huntingdon and his wife Lucy. His three elder brothers died before his birth and he succeeded his father in 1656 at the age of five. Once the pre-eminent family in Leicestershire, the Hastings declined in influence after decades of over-spending and losses incurred during the 1642 to 1651 Civil Wars. The 6th Earl remained neutral but his younger brother Henry commanded the Royalist garrison holding the family seat of Ashby de la Zouch Castle. This was partially destroyed by Parliamentary forces during the 1647 to 1648 Second English Civil War and Henry escaped abroad. The family relocated to the nearby Donington Hall estate, where Hastings was educated by his mother and his uncle Henry, who returned from exile in 1660. As a reward for his loyalty, Charles II created him Baron Loughborough and Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire, an office held by the Hastings family almost continuously between 1550 and 1642. When he died in 1667, John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland took his place and regaining this position became Hastings' over-riding ambition. In 1672, Hastings married Elizabeth Lewis (died 1688), whose sister Mary (died 1684) was wife of the Earl of Scarsdale; the two were co-heiresses of Sir John Lewis, a wealthy merchant who owned Ledstone Hall, in West Yorkshire. They had nine children, only two of whom survived to adulthood; George, 8th Earl of Huntingdon (1677-1704) and Elizabeth (1682-1739), a noted supporter of women's education. Elizabeth died in 1688 and two years later, Hastings married Mary Fowler (1664‚Äì1723), wealthy widow of Thomas Needham, 6th Viscount Kilmorey (1659-1687). They had two sons and four surviving daughters; Ann (1691-1755), Catherine (1692-1739), Frances (1693-1750), Theophilus, 9th Earl of Huntingdon (1696-1746), Margaret (1699-1768) and Ferdinando (1699-1726). Career Unrest caused by the Popish Plot led to the arrest of Titus Oates in August 1681; previously a supporter, Hasting changed sides and became a government loyalist Hastings took his seat in the Lords and was a reliable supporter of the Crown until 1677, when the 9th Earl of Rutland succeeded his father as Lord Lieutenant. The Manners family supported Parliament in the Civil Wars, and Hastings was frustrated by a perceived lack of gratitude for his family's service. He joined the faction led by the Earl of Shaftesbury, who opposed Charles' efforts to rule without Parliament and campaigned against 'Popery and arbitrary government.' The potential succession of the Catholic, pro-French Duke of York was seen as another step towards absolutism and led to the 1679‚Äì1681 Exclusion Crisis. Hastings became a prominent supporter; at a public dinner in 1679, he proposed a toast to the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, viewed as an alternative to James, and 'confusion to Popery', prompting a heated exchange with other guests. During the anti- Catholic campaign known as the Popish Plot in 1680, Hastings voted for the execution of Viscount Stafford, as did seven of eight members of Stafford's own family. It led to the execution of 22 alleged conspirators and caused widespread unrest; in August 1681, Titus Oates, source of the accusations, accused the Queen of conspiring to poison Charles. This was seen as going too far and many now withdrew their support, including Hastings; banned from Court in 1680, he was restored to favour in October 1681. In February 1682, he paid Scarsdale ¬£4,500 for his post as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners, a ceremonial bodyguard with close access to the monarch. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1683 and when James became king in February 1685, he was made Justice in Eyre and colonel of an infantry regiment. At the start of his reign, James had widespread backing, inheriting a legislature so dominated by his supporters it became known as the Loyal Parliament. Memories of the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms meant the majority feared the consequences of removing the 'natural' heir; this caused the rapid collapse of the Monmouth and Argyll rebellions in June 1685. However, the Church of England and the legal system were key elements of a stable society; James' religious policies undermined the former, attempts to enforce them attacked the latter. When Parliament refused to pass his measures, it was suspended in November 1685 and thereafter he ruled by decree; the principle was accepted, the scope and approach were not, and judges who opposed his interpretation were dismissed. This forced James to rely on a few loyalists, one being Hastings, who was made a member of the Commission for Ecclesiastical Causes in July 1686. A number of people, including his first wife, accused him of being a secret Catholic; if true, this was controversial, since the Commission was set up to enforce compliance on the Church of England. Suspicions increased when he was exempted from the 1678 Test Act requiring office holders swear to uphold 'the Protestant religion.' The Seven Bishops after their acquittal, June 1688; signing their arrest warrant severely impacted Hastings' later reputation In late 1687, James tried to ensure a Parliament that would vote for his Declaration of Indulgence; only those who confirmed their support for repealing the Test Act would be allowed to stand for election as Member of Parliament. Lord-Lieutenants were to administer the so-called 'Three Questions'; many resigned rather than do so, including Scarsdale, who Huntingdon replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire. Combined with the trial of the Seven Anglican bishops for seditious libel in June 1688, James' policies now seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and Nonconformists and into an assault on the Church of England. Wild celebrations when the bishops were acquitted made it seem only his deposition could prevent widespread civil unrest and the vast majority of his Tory supporters abandoned him. The seven signatories of the Invitation to William asking him to assume the English throne included representatives from the Tories, the Whigs, the Church and the Navy. During the Glorious Revolution in November 1688, Hastings and his regiment were sent to secure Plymouth; on arrival, he was arrested by its governor, the Earl of Bath, who declared for William. He was released on 26 December, two days after his wife died in childbirth; as one of thirty individuals exempted from the 1690 Act of Grace, he forfeited his offices although he continued to attend the Lords. He initially retained some local influence and in 1690, his support helped elect Sir Edward Abney, Tory candidate for Leicester. Thereafter the borough was dominated by the Manners family and he withdrew from active politics. As a committed Jacobite, Hastings was arrested during the 1692 invasion scare, allegedly because his stables were 'full of horses'. After the March 1696 Jacobite assassination plot, he voted against the execution of Sir John Fenwick and refused to take the loyalty oath imposed by Parliament. One of his last acts was to vote against the Act of Settlement that disinherited the Catholic Stuart exiles in favour of the Protestant Sophia of Hanover. His later years were dominated by a long- running legal dispute with his eldest son over his first wife's estates, which was settled only after his death. He died in London on 30 May 1701 and was succeeded by George, who served in the Low Countries during the War of the Spanish Succession and died of fever in 1705. Assessment The exiled James being greeted by Louis XIV in 1689; Hastings remained a committed supporter until his death Although Hasting was a minor political figure and not unusual in changing sides, on the rare occasions he is mentioned by historians, he is described as a 'facile instrument of the Stuarts,' a 'turncoat' or 'outright renegade.' 17th century England was an intensely hierarchical society; many who supported James in 1685 and beyond did so because they considered him king due to birth and divine favour. His personal failings could not change this and five of the Seven Bishops later refused to swear allegiance to William on these grounds, which led to the Nonjuring schism. This was also the justification used by the five peers who voted against the Act of Settlement, two of whom were Hasting and Scarsdale. Hostility to Catholicism arose from the wider international context, where French expansion under Louis XIV threatened the Dutch Republic and other parts of Protestant Europe. In October 1685, 200,000-400,000 French Protestants were forced into exile by the Edict of Fontainebleau, 40,000 of whom settled in London. Combined with the killing of around 2,000 Vaudois Protestants in 1686, it made attempts by James to impose religious tolerance ill-timed. Lady Elizabeth (1682-1739), a noted supporter of women's education The 1678 Test Act required public officials to swear to uphold the primacy of the Protestant religion and Church of England, as did James at his coronation; most considered this incompatible with legal 'tolerance' for Catholics or Non-Conformists. In practice, these groups were allowed to worship in private, and many of them viewed the measures as bringing unwelcome publicity. When James nominated the Non- Conformist Sir John Shorter as Lord Mayor of London, he insisted on complying with the Test Act, due to a 'distrust of the King's favour...thus encouraging that which His Majesties whole Endeavours were intended to disannull.' Scarsdale and many others resigned their offices in protest, while army officers including Churchill and Trelawny, formed the Association of Protestant Officers to oppose them. Hastings signed the warrant committing the bishops to the Tower, when even hardline supporters like Lord Chancellor Jeffreys opposed their prosecution; it was this distinction that was held against him. His reputation for inconsistency was increased during the 1689 Convention Parliament, when he voted first against a Regency, then with the Jacobite loyalists, and finally in favour of making William king. Historian Peter Walker argues all other issues were secondary to restoring his family's position, but 'continued loyalty to James in his last years suggests (he) was not a man bereft of principle.'

Secarecytosis differs from holocrine and apocrine secretory mechanisms in that it occurs only during development and that portions of cells, complete with their organelles, are lost. It has three documented phenotypes. These are: * formation of a double cell membrane and separation between the two membranes; * formation of large vacuoles in the supranuclear cytoplasm, their subsequent fusion with each other and with the lateral cell membranes thus separating the apical portion; * formation of many tiny vesicles that fuse with each other and the cell membrane thus severing portions of the cell.

It only appears in his short story collection Capitol. Plot summary This story is about the early research done on the fictional drug Somec. After some preliminary research had been done on Somec it was used to put a number of cancer patients into suspended animation. Afterwards it was discovered that in addition to putting people to sleep Somec also erased their entire memory. Doctors tried to treat this condition by implanting false memories recorded from other people into the patients, but this met with limited success - the drug had not altered the patient's personality, and they had great difficulty in accepting that they would have performed many of the actions that they now remembered as theirs. When the scientist in charge of the project taped his own memories and then injected himself with Somec it was proved that a person could be revived from suspended animation if that person's own memories were recorded and then played back into the empty mind. Connection to the Worthing Saga This book uses several plot elements also used in The Worthing Saga, such as the sleeping drug Somec and the taping of memories. The story can be considered the earliest (in story timeline) prequel to The Worthing Saga. It takes place on Earth and is followed chronologically by the story \\"A Thousand Deaths\\".

Excavated in 1679, it was Europe's first navigable canal tunnel and is a monument to the determination of Pierre-Paul Riquet, the chief engineer. It is located in the commune of Nissan-lez-Ens√©rune near to the archaeological site Oppidum d'Ens√©rune. There was great disappointment when the works reached the hill d'Ens√©rune. A few metres of digging in hard rock revealed a very brittle sandstone subject to slippage. Colbert, the prime minister, halted the works when he was made aware of the situation. The portal was blocked and the workings re-sited. Riquet's detractors took advantage of this situation to impede the project. Colbert announced that he would send royal commissioners to decide the canal's future. The advice of the Chevalier de Clerville, architect to Louis XIV, was to cross the River Aude rather than tunnel through the hill. Riquet, however, maintained his preference for a tunnel because of the extra problems that crossing the Aude would create. Riquet's response was to ask his master mason, Pascal de Nissan, to continue tunneling in secret despite the risk of collapse. In less than eight days the tunnel was complete with a concrete ceiling throughout. The tunnel is 165m long with an arch 8m above the canal's surface, and removed the necessity for an extra lock. By the time the Malpas Tunnel was excavated in the seventeenth century, the hill had already for several centuries been the site of a tunnel, dug in the Middle Ages, to drain the √âtang de Montady. This pre-existing tunnel is said to have been Riquet's inspiration for the Malpas Tunnel. In the nineteenth century, a third tunnel was excavated, passing through the Hill d'Ens√©rune beneath the Malpas tunnel to house the B√©ziers to Narbonne railway line.

It first appeared in his short story collection Capitol and then later in The Worthing Saga. Plot summary \\"Skipping Stones\\" is the story of two boys who grow up together. One is the son of a very wealthy man while the other is an indentured servant. Despite these differences the two boys become best friends. As children they both enjoy art and study it together. When they grow up, the rich boy goes into his father‚Äôs business and begins using the fictional drug Somec to put himself into a state of suspended animation for five years at a time so that he will live longer - a common practice in his society for those who can afford it. When he becomes a young man, the servant is released from his contract but is too poor to go on Somec, so he continues to paint to make a living. Each time he comes out of suspended animation the rich man finds that his friend is becoming more successful as an artist. Eventually the artist is famous and rich enough to afford to go on Somec himself - but declines to do so, preferring to live his life as a contiguous whole rather than skipping across time like a stone across the water.
