The species is the first known fossil record of highly deep-bodied Neopterygii ginglymodians. Description Kyphosichthys (Greek for \\"bent fish\\") has a strongly arched hump between the head and the dorsal fin, from which its name derives. The holotype measures 96 mm in total length, and 76 mm in standard length. The greatest body height occurs at the posterior opercular margin, where the body height is over 70% of the standard length. The dorsal fin and anal fin are located far back on the body, the latter is only half as long as the dorsal fin. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins. The forked caudal fin is hemi-heterocercal due to a heavy lobe extending into the dorsal lobe of the fin, but outwardly is nearly symmetrical. The body is covered in ganoid scales; those of the anterior flank are decorated with ornate ridges and tubercles while the scales further back are smoother. In describing Kyphosichthys, Xu and Wu compared its body form to modern day deep-bodied fish such as the boarfish and butterflyfish (Chaetodon sp.), and inferred that Kyphosichthys was similarly a slow swimmer but highly maneuverable, likely adapted to structurally complex habitats. Classification Kyphosichthys is assigned as incertae sedis within the Ginglymodii, a group of Holostean fish which includes the living gars as well as extinct species. A phylogenetic analysis of Kyphosichthys and other Mesozoic neopterygians placed Kyphosichthys in an unresolved polytomy with Lepisosteus (living gars) and the extinct Semionotus.

He holds the world record for consecutive marathons run on consecutive days, 607. He is famous for executing the project \\"500 marathons in 500 days\\", in which he completed 500 marathons in 500 consecutive days. He started on the 1st of October 2010 and finished on February 12, 2012. He ran at least one marathon in every one of the 50 provinces of Spain. Abad sold each of the 21,000 km he ran at the rate of one euro each and donated the money to ANFAS, a Spanish organization that works in favour of people with intellectual disabilities. Ricardo broke the world record for consecutive marathons (366) on 1 October 2011 in Madrid. Before him, the record was held by the Belgian Stefaan Engels (365). And before Engels, the record was held by Ricardo Abad with 150 marathons in a row in 2009. After breaking the record he went on to complete 500 marathons in Barcelona on February 12, 2012. The day after that he announced that he wanted to double the number and would continue running for another 500 days to complete 1000 marathons in 500 days. He set May 22, 2012 as the deadline to find the necessary funding for the project, which included running a marathon in every continent in the world. Finally, after failing to find financing, he abandoned the project on 29 May 2012 after 607 marathons, which is the current world record. Ricardo ran all these marathons in a row even though he works in a factory 8 hours per day in shifts: for one week during the mornings, for another week during the evening and for another week during the night. When he worked in the morning or at night, he would run in the afternoon. When he worked in the evenings, he ran during the morning. Because of this, he would sometimes run two marathons in less than 12 hours. In 2012 he has been nominated for the Prince of Asturias Awards, as he already was in 2009.  Challenges  Among the most important challenges Ricardo Abad has completed are: * 150 marathons in 150 consecutive days (2009). * Caring peninsula (Peninsula Solidaria): Ricardo covered the Spanish perimeter in multiple stages in two phases.

The message format is referred to as METGM. STANAG 6022 is the latest step http://nigelef.tripod.com/fc_meteor.htm in artillery meteorological messaging, which provides for gridded meteorological data. This means that instead of using a single Radiosonde ascent capturing local data over a short time period, and circulating that information using older formats, such as the Standard Computer Meteorological message (METCM) under STANAG 4082, it provides a grid of data in four dimensions ‚Äì vertical, two horizontal and time. The METGM is compiled from many data sources in Weather Analysis Centres (WACs). The data is no longer directly human readable in ASCII text, like METCM was, and thus it can not be distributed by voice. Data communications are used transfer the METGM to a fire control computer. A METGM approach can thus reduce or remove the need for local data acquisition for some communities. The format allows meteorological data to be published for a grid of any defined size / resolution containing only those parameters specifically requested by users. Thus, it can be used to pass data sets varying from coarse resolution, single-parameter data through to very high resolution, multi- parameter data depending upon specific data requirements and communications capabilities. The area of coverage for Artillery usage can be scaled based on the modibility of the underlying forces and the range of the howitzers. A particular benefit of this approach is that it provides data that is more representative of the wider meteorological conditions and appropriate data will be used along the trajectory as range is increasing in modern artillery weapon platforms. Products within the NATO Armaments Meteorological Kernel (NAMK) project under the SG2 Shareable (Fire Control) Software Suite (S4) can be used to process compliant METGM messages. It can also potentially be used, instead of Standard Target Acquisition Meteorological message (METTA) under STANAG 4140, with Sound ranging systems or in support of Chemical Biological, Radiological and Nuclear calculations for downwind hazards and plume prediction by tools such as the Joint Effects Model (JEM).Advanced Planning Briefing to Industry, Slide 13.

History The painting originally decorated the altar of St. Sabinus in the Cathedral of Siena, and had been commissioned as part of a cycle of four altarpieces dedicated to the city's patrons saints (St. Ansanus, St. Sabinus of Spoleto, St. Crescentius and St. Victor) during 1330‚Äì1350. These included the Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus by Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi, the Presentation at the by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (1342, altar of St. Crescentius), and a Nativity, now disassembled, attributed to Bartolomeo Bulgarini from 1351 (altar of St. Victor). All the paintings should represent stories of the Life of the Madonna, and were crowned by Duccio di Buoninsegna's Maest√†. Description The work is a triptych, although the scenes are set in the same location (an unusual feature for the time), a room whose vaults follow the shape of the panel; the scenes, painted using a crude geometrical perspective, are separated by two white piers in the foreground. The vaults have a starry night sky, as typical of Gothic edifices of the time. The left scene depicts Joachim, Mary's father, waiting together with a child and an old man. Behind him, an opened lunette and arcade show the court of a Gothic palace. St. Anna is lying on a bed (a typical medieval chest) in the central scene with a white drape behind, while, in the foreground, two women are washing her daughter. A woman, wearing a red dress, is shown behind the right pier, while speaking with Anna; she holds an inlaid object, perhaps a banner or a musical instrument.

He plays as a scrum-half for Japan on international level and for the Panasonic Wild Knights and the at domestic level. Career Tanaka was not seen as one of the top prospects in Japan whilst at University, but after joining the Panasonic Wild Knights in 2007 he played alongside former All Blacks fly half Tony Brown who was credited with helping him to develop immensely and Tanaka himself cites Brown as one of the most important influences on his career. After Tanaka's first season in the Top League in 2007/08, he was named in the team of the season alongside Brown and also was named as newcomer of the year. After his first season in the Top League. Tanaka made his debut for against the Arabian Gulf in May 2008 coming off the bench. He soon became a regular member of the Japan side and made the squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup as first choice scrum half and is currently considered one of Japan's best and most important players. At domestic level, after being named in the Top League team of the season in his first year, he backed that up by being named in it again in 2008‚Äì09 and 2010‚Äì11. After performing well at the World Cup despite it being a disappointing tournament for Japan, along with hooker Shota Horie he was signed by Otago and reunited with Tony Brown, his former teammate at the Panasonic Wild Knights who was now his coach. He won plaudits for his performances with Otago with his coach Brown calling him a \\"world class player\\" and the New Zealand Herald noted him as one of the most exciting players in the ITM Cup and was regarded as a cult hero for Otago and seen as their standout player. Following his good performances with Otago, he became the first ethnic Japanese player to sign a Super Rugby contract when he was named in the Highlanders squad for the 2013 season. After signing for the Highlanders, there was significant international media interest in him as the first Japanese player to play Super Rugby. He was said to have most interview requests out of anybody in the Highlanders team and attracted more attention than many of the World Cup winners in the squad. Japanese TV channels NHK and WOWOW did documentaries on his time in New Zealand, he also received a segment on IRB Total Rugby and even made the pages of the New York Times. After initially being limited to mainly to substitute appearances behind All Blacks scrum half Aaron Smith, in Tanaka's second start in Super Rugby he was highly lauded for his performance against the Blues which even drew positive comments from the IRB CEO Brett Gosper. In June 2013, Tanaka helped inspire Japan to their first ever win over where he continued his run of form and was praised as one of the game's outstanding performers. He was also instrumental to the Japanese 32‚Äì34 victory over the Springboks in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, being selected Man of the Match. Notes At just 166 cm tall and weighing about 72 kg, Tanaka is one of the smallest professional rugby players in the world. He was the smallest player at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and is understood to be the smallest player ever to have been involved in Super Rugby. Tanaka has commented that his size \\"is an advantage\\". Tanaka has a tradition of shaving his head before the first game of the rugby season.

He died September 2, 2011 at his home following a long illness. Siegel, a neurophysiologist, was interested in the basic mechanisms underlying visual motion and spatial perception, with the ultimate goal of developing applications to assist people who have visual processing disorders and neurological injuries. He performed pioneering work on parietal neurons and the influence of eye position and attention on perception. His laboratory became the first to perform optical imaging of parietal cortex in behaving non-human primates. Biography Siegel earned his B.S. in physics and his Ph.D. in physiology from McGill University in Montreal. Ralph's 1984 Ph.D. thesis in the lab of Richard I. Birks revealed astonishingly large and long-lasting potassium conductance and sodium pump driven voltage changes that occur following bursts of action potentials in thin axons that model presynaptic nerve terminals. After completing his graduate studies at McGill on theoretical neuroscience of spiking behaviour in neural dendrites, Ralph moved to the Salk Institute where he began to focus on in vivo, behavioral neurophysiology of monkeys. Ralph was at the forefront of experimental studies to understand the neurophysiology of cognitive processes in primates in the early 1980s. He was a co-discoverer of the gain-field mechanisms of neuronal population encoding, and employed precise psychophysical methods to understand visual motion perception at the level of neuronal activity. In 1987 Ralph began a postdoctoral position in the laboratory of Nobel Prize winner, Torsten Wiesel, at Rockefeller University. While at Rockefeller, Ralph nurtured a latent interest in theoretical studies of cortical visual processing and the rapidly emerging field of optical imaging of cortex, through collaboration with a pioneering group led by Amiram Grinvald. Ralph then moved to the lab of Richard Andersen at the Salk Institute as a postdoctoral fellow where became a co-discoverer of the gain- field mechanisms of neuronal population encoding, and began the work that he continued throughout his career in employing precise psychophysical and physiological methods to understand visual motion perception at the level of neuronal activity. In 1991 Ralph moved to the newly established Rutgers Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience where he was on the faculty for the remainder of his career. Ralph maintained his scientific collaborations with his former colleagues at the Salk Institute, making annual summer visits to La Jolla. During this period, he continued his pioneering neurophysiological and behavioral work on the organization and functions of visual cortex in the parietal lobe and continued to develop the use of optical microscopic techniques to monitor neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. In collaboration with the Salk Institute's Ed Callaway (head of the Callaway Lab for the study of the organization and function of cortical circuits) and UC Berkeley's Ehud Isacoff (whom Ralph trained in the Birks lab at McGill, leading to a lasting friendship), Ralph began to develop tools that enabled optical monitoring of activity from neurons in behaving animals. In 2012 Siegel's first book and memoir, Another Day in the Monkey's Brain, was published, by Oxford University Press, with the help of his lifelong friend and colleague, Dr. Oliver Sacks.

Bungandidj was historically frequently rendered as Boandik or Booandik. Language The Bungandidj language is a Pama-Nyungan language, and is classified as belonging to the Bungandidj/Kuurn-Kopan-Noot subgroup of the Victorian Kulin languages. Their own name for their language was Drualat- ngolonung (speech of man), or, alternatively, Booandik-ngolo (speech of the Bungandidj). It consisted of 5 known dialects, Bungandidj, Pinejunga, Mootatunga, Wichintunga and Polinjunga. It has recently been studied by Barry Blake. Related vocabulary in Bungandidj includes: drual (man); barite (girl); moorongal (boy); and ngat (mother) Country According to Christina Smith in her 1880 book on the Bungandidj - The Boandik Tribe of South Australian Aborigines: A Sketch of Their Habits, Customs, Legends, and Language - :\\"The aborigines of the South-East were divided into five tribes, each occupying its own territory, and using different dialects of the same language. Their names were Booandik, Pinejunga, Mootatunga, Wichintunga, and Polinjunga.\\" The largest clan, according to Smith, was the Bungandidj who occupied country from the mouth of the Glenelg River to Rivoli Bay North (Beachport), extending inland for about . Some controversy exists as to which tribe, the Bungandidj or Meintangk, occupied the stretch of land between Rivoli Bay and Cape Jaffa, and in particular which of the two was in possession of the Woakwine Range. The other clans occupied country from between Lacepede Bay to Bordertown. The Bungandidj shared tribal borders with the Ngarrindjeri people of the Coorong and Murray mouth to the west, the Bindjali and Jardwadjali to the north and the Gunditjmara people to the east. Anthropologist Norman Tindale argued in 1940 and again in 1974 that at the time of European settlement the Bungandidj were under territorial pressure from the Jardwadjali people to the north forcing the Bungandidj territorial boundary south from Gariwerd towards present day Casterton. However the historian Ian D. Clark has challenged Tindale's conclusions, arguing that the ethnohistoric and linguistic evidence does not support Tindale's claims regarding the boundaries between the Bungandidj and Jardwadjali. Social organization The Bungandidj were divided into two marriage classes: Kumite and Kroke, with children being assigned their mother's class. Within the Kumite class there were five major animal totems * : fishhawk * : pelican * : crow * : black cockatoo * : (harmless) snake The Kroke class had 4 major totems: * : owl * : teatree scrub * : an edible root * : white crestless cockatoo. Each of these divisions had many animals, plants, and inanimate elements correlated with it. These totemic items were treated as the friend of all members of a totemic clan, and restrictions were imposed on eating species associated with them, except under extreme circumstances when due sorrow and remorse was expressed. The southerly groups appeared to have a migratory cycle consisting of setting up camps for fishing in the south over the warmer seasons, and then, with the onset of winter, leaving the stormy coasts to hunt and fish inland. Later reports describe their housing arrangements, of mud-daubed wurlies more comfortable than the shepherds' huts later constructed by pastoralists. History =Pre History= The territory of not only the Bunganndidj but also their neighbours the Meintangk, has been revealed, by archaeological explorations, to have been inhabited for some 30,000 years. Coastal occupation around the Robe and Cape Banks attests that habitation from, at a low estimate, 5,800 BP. =First Contact= First contact between the Bungandidj and Europeans occurred in the early 1820s. Panchy from the Bungandidj recounted to Christina Smith the story of the first sighting of ships at Rivoli Bay in either 1822 or 1823, and his mother's abduction for 3 months before she was able to escape when the ship put in at Guichen Bay. When Governor George Grey led an expedition of surveyors, overland from Adelaide to Mt Gambier during April‚ÄìMay 1844, the diarist and painter George French Angas who accompanied them, noted that they found, from Woakwine Range onwards, numerous native tracks, and old encampments with abandoned wurlies, and heaps of banksia cones, which were used to make sweet drinks, mud weirs in swamps to catch fish, wicker-work traps to snare birds, and raised platform structures for spotting emus and kangaroos to hunt. =Conflict and dispossession= In November 1834 Edward Henty settled near Portland, starting the movement of European settlers and their sheep, cattle, horses and bullocks across the Western plains of Victoria and the south east region of South Australia. Settlement occurred rapidly over the following two decades with significant frontier conflict taking place involving theft of sheep, spearings, massacres and mass poisoning of the natives. Grey's expedition reported encountering very few indigenous people, no more than groups of two or three. The abundance of signs of previous native land use with the scarcity of sighted natives was explained as due to the smallpox, introduced by Europeans in the north, which has spread out, after devastating the Murray tribes and decimated Aboriginal people further south. There are a number of reports of poisoned flour or damper being given or left for natives in the settlement of Victoria and South Australia at the time. According to the accounts given by Pendowen, Neenimin and Barakbouranu, and narrated to Christina Smith: :We tasted the mutton, and found it very good; but we buried the damper, as we were afraid of being poisoned. In 1843 Henry Arthur joined his brother Charles in establishing a sheep run at Mount Schank. Trouble with Buandig people and dingoes, however, drove the Arthur brothers to sell up in 1844. The Hentys also had problems with their Mount Gambier sheep runs with theft of their sheep and shepherds speared to death in 1844. Such heavy losses occurred that the Hentys were forced to withdraw all their flocks from the Mount Gambier run.The Leake brothers on their Glencoe Station also reported problems losing 1,000 sheep from their 16,000 flock during 1845. Hostilities are reported to have continued around the Glenelg River region for the next two years. Mistreatment of Aboriginal people was at a level in 1845 where the commissioner of police drew attention to the atrocious treatment in the Rivoli Bay District: :... damper poisoned with corrosive sublimate ‚Ä¶ [and] driving the Natives from the only watering places in the neighbourhood. The Native women appear likewise to have been sought after by the shepherds, whilst the men were driven from the stations with threats. In 1848, the Avenue Range Station massacre occurred in the Guichen Bay region of South Australia. At least 9 indigenous Bungandidj Wattatonga clan people were allegedly murdered by the station owner James Brown who was subsequently charged with the crime. The case was dropped by the Crown for lack of European witnesses. Until that year, blacks were unable to testify under oath. Christina Smith's source from the Wattatonga tribe refers to 11 people killed in this incident by two white men. The cause of the massacre was the theft of sheep for food. A report by Mr Smith to Dr Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines, in April 1851 reveals that \\"the natives belonging to the Rivoli Bay Tribe (Buandig) are all quiet, and most of them usefully employed in one way or another by the settlers.\\" The report also raises with concern that \\"infanticide has been and is still practiced among the natives here.\\", and \\"relations existing between native woman and the Europeans are very discreditable.\\" As late as 1854, settlers on Bungandidj land still expressed fears of being attacked. The Leake Brothers of Glencoe Station built what they called their 'Frontier House' in 1854 which is described as a 'large homestead with slits in the walls through which rifles could be used against any likely intruder,' according to local historian Les Hill. Gradually a certain accommodation was made with Buandig people working as station hands, shearers and domestic servants while remaining on their own land. According to Bell and Marsden, aboriginal people made wurley encampments on the edge of Kingston and even moved into cottages at Rosetown on Kingston's northern side in 1877. The people often moved camp seasonally gathering and using traditional foods and using the traditional local burial ground. They record that the Blackford Reserve on the Bordertown Road was another locality where aboriginal people lived until the 1970s. Kingston and Bordertown were the territorial border shared between the Buandig and the Ngarrindjeri. There are many people in the region who identify as Bungandidj today. Descendants of the Bungandidj and the Meintangk continue to nurture and protect their culture through the Kungari Aboriginal Cultural Association based in Kingston SE.

The city has had a continuous double-digit increase in GDP since 1992. In 2009, the city's GDP registered a 15 percent increase, reaching RMB441.77 billion, while per capita GDP hit RMB71,833. According to a nationwide appraisal by the National Bureau of Statistics, Dalian ranks eighth among Chinese cities in terms of overall strength. The city's main industries include machine manufacturing, petrochemicals and oil refining, and electronics. The city is also striving to build up an IT and software center ‚Äì it is now an increasingly important software exporter to Japan. Finance and other service industries are growing as well. As of 2006, 21 foreign-funded banks and financial institutions have set up branches or agencies in the city. Dalian's Xinghai Convention and Exhibition Center has hosted over 300 events, including the Dalian Import and Export Commodities Fair and Dalian International Garment Fair. Agriculture and aquaculture Dalian was originally an agriculture and aquaculture-based area, which, after the opening of the ferry between Yantai and L√ºshun during the early 20th century, began to be populated by the farmers and fishermen of Shandong, across the Yellow Sea. Corn, vegetables, fruit such as apples, cherries and pears are Dalian's typical agricultural products. Aquaculture is well developed in Dalian, exporting seaweed, scallops, sea urchins and others to Japan, Korea and other countries. Heavy, light and distribution industries Even before and during the Sino-Japanese War, the shipbuilding and locomotives industries were a thriving industry, such as the companies which later became Dalian Shipbuilding Co. and Dalian Locomotive & Rolling Stock Works (DLoco). After the War, Dalian became an important center of the heavy and light industries, including companies such as Dalian Heavy Industry Co., Dalian Chemical Group, and Wafangdian Bearing Co.; and of the distribution industry, including such as Dashang Group. Overseas retailing giants, such as Wal-Mart from the US., Carrefour from France and Metro from Germany have recently opened stores in Dalian. Mycal, the Japanese retailing chain store, was bought out by its Chinese partner, Dashang Group, and is operated as Mykal. Dalian Port is emerging as a very important port for international trade. A new harbor for oil tankers, at the terminus of an oil pipeline from the Daqing oilfields, was completed in 1976. Dalian is the 6th largest port in China. Accordingly, Dalian is a major center for oil refineries, diesel engineering, and chemical production. Also completed recently is a newer port on Dagushan Peninsula on the northern suburbs, specializing in import/export of mining and oil products. Together with its Dalian Railroad Station, Dalian International Airport and two major express roads to Shenyang (Shenda Expressway)-Changchun (Changda Expressway)-Harbin (Hada Expressway) in the north and to Dandong to the east, Dalian has become an important distribution center. Industrial zones Dalian has been given many benefits by the PRC government, including the title of \\"open-city\\" (1984), which allows it to receive considerable foreign investment (see Special Economic Zone). The Development Zone was established in Jinzhou District, to which many Japanese manufacturing companies, such as Canon, Mitsubishi Electric, Nidec, Sanyo Electric and Toshiba, followed by Korean, American and European companies (such as Pfizer). In March 2007, Intel announced plans to build a semiconductor fabrication facility (commonly known as a fab) in the Development Zone, Dalian. It is Intel's first fab to be built at an entirely new site in over 15 years. The fab at Dalian will make the chip sets that support Intel's microprocessors and is expected to begin operation in the first half of 2010. (Source: The Wall Street Journal; 26 March 2007; Page B6) Other zones in the city include the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone, Dalian Export Processing Zone, Dalian Free Trade Zone, and Dalian Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone. Dalian Economic & Technological Development Zone was established in September 1984, as one of the first of the China National Economic and Technological Development Zones. The zone had a GDP of 70.31 billion yuan in 2007 and the total volume of import and export trade is 14.92 billion dollars, which accounts for a quarter of the whole Liaoning Province's. Most of the enterprises in Dalian ETDZ are factories foreign enterprises, especially from Japan, South Korea and USA, such as Canon, Pfizer, Toshiba and Intel.RightSite.asia  Dalian Economic & Technological Development Zone Dalian Export Processing Zone Dalian Export Processing Zone was approved to be set up by State Council in April 2000, with a planned area of 2.95 km2. It is divided into two parts, A zone and B zone. A zone has a construction area of 1.5 km2, and started operation in May 2001. All the basic infrastructure are available, which include road, water, gas, and power supply, telecommunication and so on. In A zone, it encourages several leading industries, such as home appliances, light industry, machinery, construction materials, medicine instruments.RightSite.asia  Dalian Export Processing Zone *Dalian Free Trade Zone Dalian Free Trade Zone was approved to be set up by government in May 1992. Investors can enjoy preferential policies, including duty-free. Inside the zone, all the infrastructures are available. The trade zone enjoys strategic location and convenient traffic. It has formed some leading industries, such as electronics, machinery and plastics.RightSite.asia  Dalian Free Trade Zone *Dalian Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone Dalian Hi- Tech Industrial Development Zone was approved to be a national-level development zone in 1991. It has a total area of 35.6 square kilometers. Inside the zone, all the infrastructure are available. It focuses and encourages the following industries: electronic information, bio-pharmacy, and new materials.RightSite.asia  Dalian Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone  Financial industry  Dalian is the financial center of Northeast China. There are the Dalian branches of China's five major banks: Bank of China, Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China. Dalian Commercial Bank is now called Dalian Bank, which among other things handles processing of the Dalian Mingzhu IC Card for public transportation. Dalian Commodity Exchange is the only one of its kind in China, expanding the futures market beyond soybeans. A \\"Financial Street\\" around the new Commodity Exchange building is now being planned. IT industry Since the 1990s, Dalian City has emphasized the development of the IT industry, especially in Dalian Hi-Tech Zone and Dalian Software Park in the western suburbs near Dalian University of Technology. Not only Chinese IT companies, such as DHC, Hisoft and Neusoft Group, but also American, European, Indian and Japanese IT companies are located there. Currently, the \\"Lushun South Road Software Industry Belt\\" Plan is proceeding, including Dalian Software Park Phase 2. Dalian has recently become an important center for information technology offshoring and business process outsourcing, similar to Bangalore in India ; the city was described in \\"The World Is Flat\\" by Thomas Friedman (2007). In another way, Dalian is the forerunner of China's \\"Re- Development of the Old Industry Bases in Northeast\\" National Project, which began in 2002. Intel's Fab 68 is located in Dalian. The plan was announced on 26 March 2007, and operations started on 26 October 2010. It is Intel's first chip-manufacturing fabrication in East Asia. Effects of economic growth Whilst economic growth has brought increased wealth to the city, there have been some notable environmental impacts. Most notably Chinese's worst oil spill in recorded history that occurred in 2010.

Gunn. Its plot revolves around a young boy called Kenn who grows up next to the Dunbeath river, then going on to experience the horrors of the First World War and his attempts to rediscover inner peace and satisfaction on his return to his village. Plot The plot is episodic and moves between Kenn's childhood and adult life.http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/scotlit/asls/Laverock-Gunn.html It begins with a young Kenn poaching his first salmon from the Dunbeath river. He encounters a sadistic beating from a schoolmaster, adventures in the trenches which result in his brother Angus suffering from shellshock and he meets Radzyn, an intellectual, scientific European who does not share Kenn's belief in the mystery of existence. Kenn's ultimate goal is to 'get back to the source of...life... the source of the river and the source of himself'.http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/writingscotland/learning_journeys/tartan_myths/neil_m_gunn/works.shtml#43 Gunn's description of his 'Highland River' (aka Dunbeath River) is wholly accurate, avoiding literary licence in capturing the very essence of its pools and surrounding environment. Themes Gunn was influenced greatly by Jungian archetypes and the idea of a collective unconsciousness is prevalent in Highland River. The idea of Kenn returning to the river to complete himself reflects the journey that the salmon make, returning to the place where they were spawned to spawn themselves then die. Like many early twentieth-century Scottish writers, Gunn believed in a lost 'Golden Age', when man was in touch with the natural and his environment, in contrast to a complex and disintegrating modern World. Kenn's childhood memories are presented in a stream of consciousness way.

After a long ride, elements of the American 7th Cavalry Regiment encountered a large force of Villistas at the town of Guerrero in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. In what has been called the \\"last true cavalry charge,\\" the Americans assaulted the town and routed the defenders, inflicting over seventy-five casualties on the Mexicans with the loss of only five men wounded.2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment Battle The Mexican Expedition began after Pancho Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico on March 9, 1916, in which eighteen American soldiers and civilians were killed. In response to the incident, General John J. Pershing led the United States Army into Mexico with the intention of capturing, or killing, General Villa. On March 27, Villa and his army made a simultaneous nighttime attack on the towns of San Ysidro, Minaca and Guerrero which were held by federal Carrancista troops whom Villa was also campaigning against. At Minaca and Guerrero the Villistas captured the garrisons without resistance, but at San Ysidro, the Carrancistas repulsed the attack. Villa was wounded in his right knee cap during the affair. The wound greatly impaired his command ability over the next few weeks and it nearly led to his capture by American forces. When the Battle of San Ysidro was over, the Villistas retreated to Guerrero and prepared defenses. Around this time, General Pershing received intelligence regarding the location of Villa at Guerrero, 230 miles south of Columbus, so he sent a messenger to Colonel George A. Dodd to move his 370-man force of cavalry into the area. Colonel Dodd was to ride as fast as possible to catch Villa before he moved on. When the Americans arrived at Guerrero on March 29, they had traveled about 400 miles in fourteen days, following their departure from Camp Harvey J. Jones in southern Arizona, including fifty-five miles in the seventeen hours after receiving news of Villa's position. The entire expedition was equipped with inaccurate maps of the Mexican frontier so Colonel Dodd and his men had to rely on a civilian guide, named J. B. Baker, who led the cavalry on a \\"circular march\\" across the rugged Sierra Madre.Beede, pg. 218-219 Much time was lost in the march and the men were exposed to extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. By the morning of March 29, the Americans were exhausted from their journey, low on rations, and had to fight a battle against a well defended town. According to varying sources, there were between 200 and 500 Villistas at Guerrero, spread out across the town, and for the first couple of hours after the 7th Cavalry's arrival, Dodd had his men attempt to ascertain the number of enemy forces. It wasn't until 8:00 am that the order to attack was given. Dodd divided his command into three contingents with instructions to charge and surround the town in order to cut off the Villistas's avenue of escape. When the Americans charged, fighting erupted at three points. After the charge the Americans dismounted to fight the Mexicans on foot. Guerrero was flanked by mountains on two sides which made it difficult to surround the town and the Villistas used them for cover. There were also not enough cavalrymen to cover all of the escape routes so the majority of the Mexicans got away, including Pancho Villa. Part of the Villista army mounted up and retreated east through a valley. They were pursued by some of the American cavalrymen in a ten-mile running engagement. Another force of Mexicans calmly rode out of Guerrero, pretending to be Carrancistas by displaying a Mexican national flag, this group went unmolested by the 7th Cavalry. Villa lost his friend, General Elicio Hernandez, and fifty-five others killed in the battle and another thirty-five wounded. The Americans suffered only five wounded during a five- hour battle. Colonel Dodd and his men also captured thirty-six horses and mules, two machine guns, many small arms and some war supplies. Several condemned Carrancista prisoners were liberated. Initially the Battle of Guerrero was thought to be a great opening success in the campaign but it later proved to be a disappointment as it would be the closest they came to capturing Villa in battle. However, the battle was considered the \\"most successful single engagement of Pershing's Punitive Expedition.\\" After the retreat the Villista army dispersed and for the next three months they no longer posed a significant threat to the United States military. Villa himself hid out in the hills while his knee healed. One day, not long after the battle, Villa was camped at the end of a valley and watched a troop of Pershing's cavalrymen ride by. Villa heard them singing \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary,\\" this would be the last time Americans got so close to the rebel. News of the victory was widely circulated in the United States, prompting the Senate's approval of Colonel Dodd's promotion to brigadier general.

His band played at the double wedding of the children of Moshe Dayan, which was attended by David Ben-Gurion. The speed with which he obtained his Israeli passport and his close relationship with army officers encouraged gossip columnists to accuse him of being a spy, a charge he denied out of hand. San left Israel a few months after the birth of his daughter on the eve of Yom Kippur. He settled in New York City and opened a successful nightclub, Sirocco. The club proved popular with luminaries such as Anthony Quinn, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. Eventually, however, as San developed a cocaine habit and Sirocco gained the interest of the underworld, the club was raided by the FBI, which discovered drugs on the premises. San did not cooperate with the investigation, was convicted and served a two-year sentence. Upon his release he opened a poultry business in Harlem and another nightclub, which was unsuccessful.

Paterlini began playing piano at six years old. Formal study in his chosen artistic endeavour came with five years at Campiani‚Äôs Academy, Mantua‚Äôs Academy of Arts, from where he graduated in Music Theory. The 1990s saw Paterlini extensively cutting his teeth as a gigging musician by performing rock classics, pop and jazz in local bands. While playing with these outfits he began to compose music, at this stage principally material of a progressive rock persuasion. As the decade and century drew to a close Paterlini reached an important decision, being to concentrate exclusively on the piano ‚Äì the instrument that, in his own words, ‚Äúbest expresses his inner world.‚Äù Yet it was not until 2006 that he began composing music for solo piano. In the following year his life‚Äôs musical journey took a momentous step with the release of his debut CD, Viaggi in Aeromobile (Travel in Aircraft) on the Music Center label.

Gunn. It concerns itself with an 8-year-old boy \\"Young Art\\" growing up in the Scottish Highland community of Clachdrum and in episodic form, catalogues a series of adventures and occurrences in his life, often connected with his mentor figure \\"Old Hector\\", a local character and bootlegger. The same characters would be used in the following satirical, fantasy novel, The Green Isle of the Great Deep. Plot Art is an eight-year-old boy and the book is seen mostly from his perspective. He comes from a large family and, as his father is often away fishing, his major father figure is Old Hector, the local elder who has a wide knowledge of local history and story and as is implied throughout the novel, then revealed in the final chapters, the finest bootlegger in the area. Like many of Gunn's novels, the plot is episodic and we experience events such as the local Highland Games and the birth of Art's baby sister. Indeed several of the chapters appeared extant in other published forms. The main climax of the novel is when Art, returning out of curiosity to a cave where he and a girl from the village thought a wild beast lived, uncover an illicit still run by Hector and Red Douglas (a local rascal). Art's brother Donul is also with them as they are making whisky for Duncan, Art and Donul's eldest brother's wedding. Art's discovery of the still is fortuitous as on his way he encounters three excise agents or \\"gaugers\\", who are investigating Hector. Throughout the book, Art also wishes to reach the River, a place he has never been, initially with Donul, but when Donul needs to leave to work on a cattle farm, it is Hector who takes Art to the river. Themes Art and Hector represent the extremes of youth and old age. The book is considered to be one of the \\"finest evocations of childhood ever written, conveying all the magic and misery and the bursting joys of being a small boy in a great and mysterious world.\\" Hector's role is one of an idealised Gaelic seanachie, his knowledge of his local area and history not limiting him in his dealing with universal issues such as greed and land rights. The area known as the Clash, where Art and Donul go to snare rabbits early in the book is where Hector was born and was cleared to the present village. The Clash is also where Hector takes the Gaugers to act as a red herring when they are making enquiries about the still. Art's role as the hero and saviour of Hector from the Gaugers is a theme which Gunn would develop in the following fantastical novel The Green Isle of the Great Deep. Art's triumph at the Highland Games is considered to be autobiographical due to Gunn's own talent at athletics.

The hindwings are brown with darker shading toward the outer margin. The number of generations per year varies from three in north-eastern Florida to one in the northern part of the range. In Florida, adults are on wing from April to October. The larvae feed on the needles of various Pinus species. Young larvae mine the needles of their host plant. Later, they spin a nest of silk webbing and frass. They gather needles from around their nest and bring them back to the nest to eat. The web is occupied by several larvae. The larvae are light brown with darker longitudinal stripes and a light brown head with black pigmented markings.

Allison and Cope explained the motivation behind this bias in terms of \\"righteous zeal, indignation toward certain aspects of industry\\", and other factors. The term white hat refers idiomatically to an ethically good person, in this case one who has a righteous goal. Overview This initial paper contrasted the treatment of research on the effects of nutritively-sweetened beverages and breastfeeding on obesity. They contrasted evidence which implicated these behaviors as risk and protective factors (respectively), comparing the treatment given to evidence for each conclusion. Their analyses confirmed that papers reporting null effects of soft drinks or breast-feeding on obesity were cited significantly less often than expected, and, when cited, were interpreted in ways that mislead readers about the underlying finding. Positive papers were cited more frequently than expected. For instance, of 207 citations of two papers finding no effects of sugared soft drink consumption on obesity, the majority of citations (84 and 66%) were misleadingly positive. A meta-analysis had been reported showing that industry-funded studies reported smaller effects than did non-industry-funded studies, the implication being that industry funding leads researchers to bias their results in favor of the funder's presumed commercial interest. Allison and Cope's reanalysis of these data indicated that it was poor studies that found larger effects, and that the industry-funded studies were larger and better run: a finding consistent with a white hat bias, and suggesting that the true effect of sugar-sweetened beverages is smaller than most studies report. Allison and Cope suggest that science might be protected better from these effects by authors and journals practicing higher standards of probity and humility in citing the literature. Young, Ioannidis and Al-Ubaydli (2008) discuss related concepts, framing scientific information and journals in the context of an economic good, with the goal being to transfer knowledge from scientists to its consumers, suggesting that acknowledging the full spectrum of effects on publication and treating addressing the effects as a moral imperative may aid this goal. Controversy Having shown that industry studies were well run but that publication and citation bias existed against negative findings, and as predicted from a WHB effect, Allison--being funded himself by the food and beverage industry--became the subject of a media report by ABC condemning the influence of industry on diet science.

Known for her written interventions in public and private spaces, Daudy‚Äôs work is based on an ancient Chinese literati practice. ‚ÄúShe holds up a mirror to the world, raising questions that bring introspection and remind us of our common core, that we are all connected.‚Äù Philippa Adams, Director of Saatchi Gallery, London. Living and working in London, her observations have fed into an array of artistic disciplines including sound work, film, performance, interactive collaboration, photography, sculpture, large-scale installation and more recently a book. Daudy exhibits worldwide and is also engaged in regular philanthropic and activist commitments. Recent highlights include a large-scale installation of her work ‚ÄúAm I My Brother's Keeper?‚Äù inside London's Saint Paul's Cathedral, and ‚ÄúIt Wasn‚Äôt That At All‚Äù a commissioned contemporary response to The Golden Treasure of Tutankhamun at the Saatchi Gallery, London. \\"The transience of life and the soul dominates Kate Daudy's uplifting work. From street art that washes away, impermanent writing placed around a city to words applied to fences, stones and bridges around the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, much of her carefully considered and poetic art is intended not to survive. She relishes the transitory nature of our existence on this earth, a love of the gesture for its own sake and her work embodies a rejection of consumerism. Happiness can be achieved in the ephemeral and that should be valued more by society.\\" ‚Äì Doctor Rebecca Daniels Themes The concept of writing on objects originates in the beginning of Chinese civilization, when tortoise shells and scapulae were used to predict the future. These 'oracle bones' would go through a process of being burnt in the embers of a fire; Chinese shamans would divine the future from the manner in which the bones and shells cracked and would subsequently inscribe their predictions on them.Morton, G ‚ÄúLemn Sissay and Kate Daudy‚Äù(video file) , \\"5XI5\\", accessed 4 September 2011 This was a practice particularly prevalent in the Shang Dynasty(1600-1046 BC).Skyswright, V, ‚ÄúDaniel Eskenazi and Kate Daudy Present Selling Exhibition of Their Collaborative Work at Bonhams‚Äù , \\"BONHAMS 1793\\" accessed 4 September 2011 The calligraphic writing or inscribing of poems onto objects became an elevated art form in itself, perpetuated by the ruling Emperors, who would compose poems to be inscribed onto paintings or works of art of special significance to them. By perpetuating this literary tradition as a contemporary plastic art form Daudy's work has brought these ancient concepts back to mainland China itself, where the tradition had been lost. Kate Daudy also creates written interventions, mostly in public spaces in nature, on walls and with fabric, based on an ancient Chinese literary practice of seeking to understand the universe through art and nature. Daudy's Chinese studies have driven an interest in calligraphy and Chinese philosophy, and have led to her working in a variety of mediums, including using felt fabric to create her writings. She uses felt as her medium, which is for her a symbol of redemption, as it is made from the rubbish of the fabric industry.

It is located south of Braidwood, and north-west of Lanark. Lee was the seat of the Lockharts of Lee from its establishment in the 13th century until 1919, though the present house is the result of rebuilding in the 19th century. The house is protected as a category B listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History In 1272, William Locard was granted the feudal barony of Lee. His son, Sir Simon Locard (1300‚Äì1371), fought in the Wars of Scottish Independence, and afterward accompanied Sir James Douglas in his attempt to carry the heart of Robert the Bruce to the Holy Land in 1330. Following the death of Sir James Douglas in battle with the Moors in Spain, Sir Simon carried the Bruce's heart back to Scotland for burial at Melrose Abbey. He is said to have subsequently added the heart and fetterlock to the family coat of arms. He also acquired the \\"Lee Penny\\", an amulet or touch piece said to have healing properties, and which remains in the family's possession. Sir William Lockhart of Lee (1621‚Äì1675) fought for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War, but switched sides, and later married the niece of Oliver Cromwell. Lockhart was appointed Cromwell's commissioner for the administration of justice in Scotland, in 1652. He also served as English ambassador at the French court in 1656. His brother George Lockhart was appointed Lord Advocate, and he purchased the Lanarkshire estates of the Earl of Carnwath. Both Lee and Carnwath estates were inherited by his son Sir George Lockhart of Lee (1673‚Äì1731). He acted as a commissioner for the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, but later adopted the Jacobite cause. He was involved in the Jacobite Rising of 1715 but escaped serious punishment. George's grandson, another George, fought with the Jacobites in the 1745 Rising, and afterwards went into exile. This George's younger brother James also went overseas, fighting in the Austrian army during the Seven Years' War. He inherited the Lee estates by staging the death of his traitorous older brother, and was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1782. His nephew, Alexander Lockhart of Lee, member of Parliament for Berwick- upon-Tweed, was made a baronet in 1806. By this time, the parklands around Lee Castle had been laid out, as recorded on William Roy's maps of the mid 18th century, although the form of the house at this time is unknown. Sir Charles Lockhart, 2nd Baronet (1799‚Äì1832), built a new house at Lee in 1817, but shortly after his death Sir Norman Lockhart, 3rd Baronet (1802‚Äì1849), commissioned James Gillespie Graham to design a much larger house. Work began in 1834, incorporating the earlier building, and continued until 1845. The 5th baronet made changes to the parklands in the later 19th century, but on his death in 1919 the baronetcy became extinct. In 1948 the house and estate passed out of the family, and were later split up in the 1970s. The feudal barony of Lee was granted by Petition to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Representative in Scotland, the Lord Lyon, King of Arms to The Much Honoured Terence Alvis of Lee, 23rd Baron of Cam'nethan, 33rd Baron of Lee. Baron Alvis of Lee (33rd Baron) carried out major restoration to the house over a ten-year period, during which time his son and heir, Tai Alvis of Lee was born in 1981. In 2004 the house, along with and the feudal caput, was put up for sale on the internet site eBay, although this was unsuccessful. The house was later sold for an all-time record price for a private Scottish residence to an American buyer.

When she was fifteen she applied for permission to enter the Carmelite Convent, and being refused by the superior, went to Rome with her father, as eager to give her to God as she was to give herself, to seek the consent of Pope Leo XIII, then celebrating his jubilee. He preferred to leave the decision in the hands of the superior, who finally consented and on 9 April 1888, at the unusual age of fifteen, Th√©r√®se Martin entered the convent of Lisieux where two of her sisters had preceded her. The account of the eleven years of her religious life, marked by signal graces and constant growth in holiness, is given by Soeur Th√©r√®se in her autobiography, written in obedience to her superior and published two years after her death. In 1901 it was translated into English, and in 1912 another translation, the first complete edition of the life of the Servant of God, containing the autobiography, \\"Letters and Spiritual Counsels\\", was published. Its success was immediate and it has passed into many editions, spreading far and wide the devotion to this \\"little\\" saint of simplicity, and abandonment in God's service, of the perfect accomplishment of small duties. The fame of her sanctity and the many miracles performed through her intercession caused the introduction of her cause of canonization only seventeen years after her death, 10 June 1914. Th√©r√®se was beatified on 29 April 1923 and canonized on 17 May 1925, by Pope Pius XI, only 28 years after her death. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux is the patron saint of people with AIDS, aviators, florists, illness(es) and missions. She is also considered by Catholics to be the patron saint of Russia. In 1927, Pope Pius XI named Th√©r√®se a patroness of the missions. By the Apostolic Letter Divini Amoris Scientia (The Science of Divine Love) of 19 October 1997, Pope John Paul II declared her one of the Doctors of the Universal Church, one of only three women so named, the others being Teresa of √Åvila (Saint Teresa of Jesus) and Catherine of Siena.  Church History  Blessing Tower In 1967 the people of Madumanagar, built a Church in the name of St.Teresa of Child Jesus. On those days that church was under Our Lady of Lourdes' Shrine Parish, Perambur. St. Theresa Church was bifurcated from Our Lady of Lourdes' Shrine, Perambur and established as independent Parish with 400 families in 1994.Church Details It was entrusted to Salesian priest Basil SDB. Fr. Basil (1994-2003) bought an 8 ground land in Sembiam to build a new church with more facilities. The church was built and consecrated by Archbishop Aruldos James, After nine years, the Church was handed over to Archdiocese of Madras-Mylapore. Fr. Inigo (2003-2010) was the first diocesan priest appointed for this parish. Our Lady's Grotto and parish house was constructed and completed in 2003Anbin Madal by him. In 2006, he began the devotion of Infant Jesus, for giving homage to the statue brought from Prague. In 2008, Fr. Inigo built Blessing Tower at the entrance of this church. In 2011, Fr.K.T.Matthew (2010‚Äì2011) furnished a guest house for priests. Fr.Stephen (2011-2013) made the interior architectural works in the church. Fr. Joseph Albert (2015-) is the present Parish Priest.  Important Events  First day of the Month: The day devoted to St.Theresa is celebrated at evening with Rosary, Novena Prayer and Mass.

Constructed as a freight station in 1989, Passenger station was built during 1993, opening in 1994 for passenger use. In late 2003 it was renovated and enlarged from a few hundred square metres in area to about . Shenzhen West railway station, originally known as Nantou railway station, is located on Xuefu Lu, Nanshan District. It is about 10 kilometers from Shekou Port. Intended to only ever be a freight-handling station for the nearby Shekou Port. Shenzhen West is now handling 45% of passenger traveling by rail to and from Shenzhen. It is a station that has evolved by necessity rather than design. Due to cramped platform space at the busy Shenzhen railway station, many long-distance services were introduced to Shenzhen West through the late 1990s and early 2000s, to cope with Shenzhen's rapidly growing migrant population. Shenzhen West railway station was expected to no longer operate as a passenger station once the new Shenzhen North railway station is finished, but it has remained open. This has been due to continued increasing public demand for cheap conventional rail services not supplied at the newer stations, built for newer, more expensive high speed trains. Train services Thirteen trains arrive and depart from Shenzhen railway station daily. Passengers can take trains from here to 12 cities including Lanzhou, Tianjin, Chengdu, Nanjing, Hefei and Jinan. Most of the train tickets from here are a little cheaper than the tickets at Shenzhen railway station, as the facilities and services in this station, as well as the facilities and services on the slower conventional speed trains are not as good as in Shenzhen railway station. Transportation In total there are 8 buses available at Shenzhen West railway station: Nos. 36, 58, 227, 229, 234, 353, B623 and B682. Liyumen Station on Shenzhen Metro Line 1 is about 200m north of the station. It is offers connections directly between Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport and Luohu Station. Future Many complaints about the poor facilities and dilapidated state of the station building have been made by the public and the operator. For example, the waiting hall lacks air conditioning. The Pingnan Railway company operating the station has applied for station renovation permits many times, but the government has vetoed plans because Shenzhen West railway station is not listed in the government's passenger railway network plan. In fact, government officials ordered the closure of the station in 2010 but it has continued operating, handling over 7 million in 2011 alone, according to Pingnan Railway records. According to the network plan adopted in 2006, Shenzhen will only have five railway stations for passengers, including Shenzhen, Shenzhen North, Shenzhen East, Futian and Longgang (Pingshan) stations. All five stations are in eastern or central parts of the city. Local support is calling for a major rail station to remain with in Nanshan, at Shenzhen West, especially with development plans to create a new Qianhai CBD area beside the harbour. It is also seen as a cheaper station for travel by many of the migrant workers living in Shenzhen, because it does not have many of the express or high speed services of other stations in Shenzhen, allowing for cheaper tickets. It was announced in January 2013 that Shenzhen West railway station will get a long-awaited facelift, construction to begin in 2013 or 2014. After years of receiving criticism for its poor condition, station operator Pingnan Railway Co. said. The station will become an important terminal for the Shenzhen-Xiamen High-Speed Railway and inter-city rail between Pearl River Delta cities. The station is expected to handle 450,000 passengers during the 2013 Spring Festival holiday. Passengers have criticized its use of temporary freight sheds as waiting halls.

Established in 1973, the organisation was re-launched in 2009 as a fellowship society and was modelled on \\"futawwah\\" clubs, groups that promoted a virtuous life based on knowledge, humility, magnanimity, hospitality, social work and the service of humanity during the Islamic Golden Age. The Institute promotes pluralism, innovation and creativity while also encouraging open debate and discussion on issues pertaining to Islam, Muslims and Muslim societies.  History  The Muslim Institute was established in 1972 as a research body devoted to drawing up detailed conceptual maps and operational plans of a Muslim civilization of the future. The initiative was led by Kalim Siddiqui, a journalist who worked for The Guardian; Ziauddin Sardar, a writer, futurist and economist; and Iqbal Asaria. The Institute was established as a charitable trust under the title, \\"The Muslim Institute for Research and Planning\\", and Siddiqui became its director. =Motivation= The founders and their associates were concerned about the decline and decay of Muslim societies. They argued that past Islamic civilizations were based on knowledge, and they were keen to rebuild this foundation of knowledge and innovation. They emphasised the urgent need for an articulate and rationally satisfying tradition of Muslim scholarship and argued that Muslim intellectuals had the potential for \\"recreating fully operational social, economic and political systems of Islam in all Muslim societies\\". =Public education= Initially, the Muslim Institute organised seminars and courses on four main areas: the philosophy of science, Islamic Economics, the study of Islamic movements and foundations of Islamic civilisation. Later, it embarked on a project called The Road to Medina, a three-volume study on the contemporary relevance of the life of Muhammad. The project was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education in Saudi Arabia, but it was never completed. The Institute was more successful in producing new work on science and technology, which included Ziauddin Sardar's book Science, Technology and Development in the Muslim World. The funding from Saudi Arabia was used to purchase a building for the Institute at 6 Endsleigh Street in London, UK. The building served as the main office of the Institute for several years. =Iranian influence= In the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Siddiqui became a strong supporter of the regime in Iran. The Muslim Institute devoted all its resources to propagating the ideology of the Islamic Revolution and its Endsleigh Street office almost became an extension of the Iranian embassy. At this juncture, Ziauddin Sardar left the Institute. =Muslim parliament= In 1989, following the publication of Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses and the ensuing controversy, Siddiqui established the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, which he described as \\"an independent representative political body for Muslims.\\" The Muslim Institute also become closely associated with the Muslim Parliament. The sudden death of Siddiqui in April 1996 ended the Muslim parliament and also concluded the Institute's relationship with Iran. The new director, academic and political activist, Ghyasuddin Siddiqui, initiated a series of monthly brainstorming sessions to rethink the work of the Institute and provide it with new directions. Under Siddiqui's guidance, the emphasis of the Institute shifted to issues of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech, pluralism, gender equality and empowering women. The Institute launched a number of initiatives, including campaigns for \\"Child Protection in Faith- Based Environments\\" and against forced marriage, domestic violence, and honour killing. A new \\"Model Muslim Marriage Contract,\\" which grants equal rights to both partners, was also produced. The Institute subsequently played a role in the formation of the City Circle, British Muslims for Secular Democracy and The MUJU Crew (a Muslim‚ÄìJewish theatre group). =Re-launch= In December 2009, after a planning conference held at Sarum College, the Muslim Institute was re-launched as an independent fellowship society of academics, writers, thinkers, artists, scientists, professionals and researchers committed to the intellectual development of Muslims. The Trust was reorganised, and its office was moved to Old Street in London. Ziauddin Sardar returned as the Chair of the Muslim Institute Trust. and launched the Muslim Institute quarterly Critical Muslim.

Work developing this process began in 2007. Since 2020 Carbfix is a subsidiary of Reykjavik Energy. Carbfix was initiated jointly by the Icelandic President, Dr √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson, Einar Gunnlaugsson at Reykjav√≠k Energy, Wallace S. Broecker at Columbia University, Eric H. Oelkers at CNRS Toulouse (France), and Sigur√∞ur Reynir G√≠slason at University of Iceland to limit the Greenhouse gas emissions in Iceland. Reykjavik Energy supplied the initial funding for Carbfix. Further funding has been supplied by The European Commission and the Department of Energy of the United States. In addition to finding a new method for permanent carbon dioxide storage, another objective of the project was to train scientists for years of work to come. After years of preliminary experimental and field characterisation approximately 200 tons were injected into subsurface basalts in 2012. Research results published in 2016 showed that 95% of the injected CO2 was solidified into calcite within 2 years, using 25 tonnes of water per tonne of CO2. Since this time this successful carbon capture and storage approach has been upscaled at Hellishei√∞i and ongoing research is implementing this approach at other sites across Europe. Carbfix Approach Image of calcite formed in basalt due to CO2-charged water-rock interaction at the Carbfix site CO2 is captured either by its dissolution in water from power plant exhaust, or directly from the atmosphere by air capture followed by its dissolution in water. The carbonated water is injected into the subsurface where it reacts with the Ca and Mg present in the rock. Calcium and magnesium are present in rocks - but rarely as oxides where the reactions would be simply: * CaO + ‚Üí CaCO3 * MgO + CO2 ‚Üí MgCO3 However silicate minerals of these elements are common in many rocks, such as basalt, so an example reaction might be: * Mg2SiO4 \\\\+ 2CO2 ‚Üí 2MgCO3 \\\\+ SiO2 as a result CO2 is locked away with no dangerous byproducts. Practicalities Drilling and injecting carbonated water at high pressure into basaltic rocks at Hellishei√∞i has been proven to be very cost effective. Estimates show that this approach captures and stores CO2 and other acid gases as stable mineral phases for less than $25 a ton. This project commenced carbon injection in 2012. The funding was supplied by the University of Iceland, Columbia University, France's National Centre of Scientific Research, the United States Department of Energy, the EU, Nordic funds and Reykjavik Energy. These funding sources include the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreements No. 764760 and 764810. The European Commission through the projects CarbFix (EC coordinated action 283148), Min-GRO (MC-RTN-35488), Delta-Min (PITN- GA-2008-215360), and CO2-REACT (EC Project 317235). Nordic fund 11029-NORDICCS; the Icelandic GEORG Geothermal Research fund (09-02-001) to S.R.G. and Reykjavik Energy; and the U.S. Department of Energy under award number DE-FE0004847. Challenges This approach requires substantial water and the presence of reactive rocks, which are not available in all localities. The nearby Hengill volcano, generated a swarm of low magnitude earthquakes as a result of pumping water without the CO2, with 250 quakes being reported on 13 September 2011. There have been earthquakes reported due to the injection of waste water in the area. Proceedings at the 2010 World Geothermal Congress reported that reinjection at Hellishei√∞i had induced seismic activity. Current status Carbfix was updated, as part of the EC funded CarbFix2 project starting in June 2014 at the Hellishei√∞i geothermal power plant. CarbFix2 was designed to capture all of the hydrogen sulfide and most of the carbon dioxide generated from the power plant. As of 2018, 68% of the H2S and 34% of the CO2 is being captured as a dissolved phase in water and injected to a depth of 750 metres underground into basaltic rocks. Results show that the majority of these injected gases are fixed as stable mineral phases in less than one year. Further work has focused on the direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere coupled to its subsurface mineralization. Carbfix is currently run by a set of 3 Scientific Directors: Sigur√∞ur Reynir G√≠slason of the University of Iceland, Eric H. Oelkers of the CNRS Toulouse, and Edda Sif Arad√≥ttir of Reykjavik Energy. Current efforts are aimed at generalizing the Carbfix process in part through the use of seawater for CO2 capture and storage, so the method can be adopted worldwide. The Carbfix approach is currently being adopted at 4 new sites in Europe through the EC funded GECO project.

History Three brothers, Ghulam Ali (Kotwal), Mohammad Saaduddin (Subedar), and Mohammad Saladuddin (Minister and Kotwal) from Jhajjar are remembered as Urdu and Persian scholars during the reign of Maharaja Senasaheb Subha Chhatrapati Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III. They founded 'Jhajjar Bagh' at Hansapuri (Now Mominpura). They built their residence 'Aina-e Mahal', a well and a Masjid (now Masjid Ahle Hadith). Also known as 'Subedar ka Bada', 'Jhajjar Bagh' was located where Mohammad Ali Road at Mominpura, Jama Masjid, Mohammad Ali Sarai and Furqania Madrasa are now situated. Masjid Gharib Nawaz At Night. Jama Masjid During Sunset. Mustafa Baba  Hazarat Mustafa Baba,was a Sufi Saint who lived in Mominpura, had followers from many nearby cities. Baba had become famous for his spiritual powers. On the night of 28 June 2011, he died, after which his followers buried his body in the playground owned by Central Tanzim Committee, which is not a registered area for burials. Baba's funeral procession had headed to Mota Tajbagh in the late evening after daylong controversy. His followers brought his body back to Mominpura, as they did not agree to certain conditions decreed by the Tajbagh dargah committee for burial. They broke open the lock of Mohammed Ali Serai's gate and apparently buried the Baba in front of the school, inside the Serai, at 5:30 am. Serai management protested the act and approached the Tehsil police. It filed a complaint of trespassing against Baba's followers. Police said that the followers had assured them they would take the body to Mominpura burial ground, but later deviated from the plan. The followers broke the Serai's lock in the presence of the police and this triggered the Gherao at the central police office later in the day. One of the agitators stated that it was not right to bury the Baba in the Serai that has the Jama Masjid close by. \\"There are bound to be clashes and frequent skirmishes if the two venues are so closely located. During festivals, it can get difficult. Devotees of one venue may be inconvenienced by presence of another,\\" he said. This led to riots between two groups, and rioters burned Baba's belongings. The rioters threw stones, damaged property and attacked police personnel and vehicles. Around 20 vehicles parked in the Sindhi Lane were damaged. A few traffic policemen were attacked by the protestors near the Geetanjali theatre. Some injured civilians and policemen were taken to hospital. Riot police were deployed at the pickets in disturbed areas. A youth was critically injured in the riot, and a section of the rioters ransacked the office of president of Mohammed Ali Serai and damaged its property. Police fired several tear gas shells and resorted to charging with their lathis.

Computer World UK 6 Oct 2011 After two delays requested by Adoboli and a change of legal representation, Adoboli pleaded not guilty to two counts each of fraud and false accounting on 30 January 2012. He was released on conditional bail after a bail application at Southwark Crown Court on 8 June 2012. He was later convicted of both counts of fraud and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. The trading incident On 15 September 2011, Adoboli was arrested under suspicion of fraud in connection with a loss of a then-estimated US$2 billion, reportedly due to unauthorized trading at the Swiss group‚Äôs investment bank. A spokesperson from the Swiss banking regulator FINMA referred to the case as one of the biggest ever seen at a Swiss bank. Adoboli had originally retained the law firm of Kingsley Napley, which previously advised Nick Leeson. However, he has now changed his legal representation to Bark & Co and Furnival Chambers, with the fees being paid by legal aid. On 30 January 2012 he pleaded not guilty to two charges of fraud and two charges of false accounting and faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted of all charges.

Market Watch, 15 September 2011, 12:10 pm EDT It has been reported that Adoboli informed UBS of his unauthorized trades, and then the bank informed the Financial Services Authority and the police. On 16 September, it was announced that City of London Police charged Adoboli with fraud by abuse of position and false accounting. On 18 September 2011, UBS issued a statement which revealed the losses from the alleged unauthorized trading stood at $2.3 billion. The rogue trader reportedly racked up the losses by speculating on EuroStoxx, DAX and S&P; 500 indexes. The prosecutor in Adoboli's trial, Sasha Wass, stated that Adoboli \\"was a gamble or two from destroying Switzerland's largest bank for his own benefit.\\" According to Business Insurance, as in the case of the unauthorized trades by Nick Leeson at the Singapore office of Barings Bank, the Adoboli incident took place at a location away from the bank's central office, where the risk management systems are typically stronger.Business Insurance 2 October 2011 The accused trader Kweku Adoboli was born 21 May 1980.Trader in UBS scandal was a ‚Äòloyal‚Äô employee Financial Times, 16 September 2011 His family home was in Tema, Ghana, but he has lived in the UK since 1991 and been described as \\"British by culture, citizenry and fame.\\" He graduated from the University of Nottingham, where he studied computer science and management, in 2003. Prior to this, he studied at Ackworth School (a Quaker-run private boarding school near Leeds), where he was Head Boy between 1997‚Äì1998, the year he graduated. According to the Daily Telegraph, shortly before the news of the incident broke, Adoboli had posted on his Facebook account that ‚ÄúI need a miracle‚Äù. Kweku's father, John Adoboli, is a former Ghanaian official at the United Nations. On the day of his son's arrest, he expressed the family's shock and disbelief: \\"We are all here reading all the materials and all the things being said about him. The family is heartbroken because fraud is not our way of life.\\" Mechanics of the incident According to UBS, Adoboli had disguised the risk of his trades by using \\"forward- settling\\" ETF cash positions.Daily Telegraph 18 Sep/2011 According to the Financial Times, and other sources, Adoboli is suspected to have used the fact that some ETF transactions in Europe are not issued confirmations until after settlement has taken place. The exploitation of this process allows a party in a transaction to receive payment for a trade before the transaction has been confirmed. While the cash proceeds in this scheme cannot be simply retrieved, the seller may still show the cash on their books and possibly use it in further transactions. The process of orchestrating fails to deliver trades may then be used in a carousel of transactions.Selwyn Parker Kweko Adoboli is not Alone in World Finance 20 Oct 2011 Unlike in the United States, no data about the volume of fails-to-delivers is available for Europe.As an example, see: SEC Fails-to-deliver data CNN and World Finance also stated that some banks have deliberately allowed certain levels of fails-to-deliver, as a method of \\"dealing with financial stress\\" so that between accounting cycles the value of securities sold, but not delivered, as well as the value of the cash booked, but not received can be reflected on the books.City Wire 10 Oct 2011 In October 2011, Sergio Ermotti, the then-interim CEO of UBS, after the departure of Gr√ºbel, admitted that the computer system at UBS had detected the unauthorized trading activities of Adoboli beforehand and had issued a warning, but the bank had failed to act on the warning. In May 2012, Sergio Ermotti, Group CEO, spoke at the UBS AGM about the changes implemented following the scandal. Ermotti spoke of improved internal monitoring and deficiencies in the financial reporting control system that have been addressed. Ermotti also made reference to employees that have been replaced or had pay docked due to serious mistakes or unreasonable behaviour.

During his career, Paratici frequently moved throughout the lower divisions of Italian Football, playing for various clubs in Serie C1 and Serie C2, and rarely staying for longer than 1 season at a time. He retired in 2004 at the age of 31, having played for 12 different clubs in 15 years. Non- playing career Upon retiring, Paratici was hired as the Chief Observer/Head of Scouting for Sampdoria in 2004. During his tenure at Sampdoria, Paratici worked very closely with the club's Director General, Giuseppe Marotta, often being described as his \\"right-hand man\\". In August 2008, Paratici was allegedly approached by Urbano Cairo, owner and chairman of Torino and offered the role of Sporting Director General. Sampdoria, and in particular Marotta, were furious at these allegations and accused Cairo of going behind their backs trying to lure Paratici, who was still under contact with Sampdoria until 2009. In May 2010, Paratici moved from Sampdoria to Juventus, along with Director General Giuseppe Marotta and Manager Luigi Delneri. At Juventus, Paratici was appointed Head of Technical Areas and Sporting Director by the new president Andrea Agnelli. Sampdoria owner Riccardo Garrone was furious with Giuseppe Marotta for taking Paratici with him to Juventus, as Garrone had expected Paratici to inherit the role of Director General at Sampdoria, and subsequently threatened to block any transfers to Juventus as a consequence.

He writes a column for The Guardian and contributes to the New Statesman and Tribune. He was previously a columnist for The Independent. Early life Jones was born in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England and grew up in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and briefly in Falkirk, Scotland. His father was a local authority worker and trade union shop steward, and his mother, Ruth Aylett, was a lecturer at the University of Salford. He describes himself as a 'fourth-generation socialist'; his grandfather was involved with the Communist Party and his parents met as members of the Trotskyist Militant group. In an article Jones wrote following his father's death in 2018, he discussed his childhood in more detail, writing that his mother was a \\"lifelong passionate feminist\\", that his parents \\"rejected ‚Äòblue‚Äô and ‚Äòpink‚Äô stereotyped clothing for (the children)... and that kind of thing,\\" and that the family also worked out a \\"rota system\\" for sharing domestic chores. Jones also said that their parents taught him and his siblings a \\"passionate hatred of injustice and bigotry\\". He attended Bramhall High School and Ridge Danyers Sixth Form College before studying History at University College, Oxford, graduating with a BA in 2005 and a Master of Studies (MSt) in US History in 2007. Before entering journalism, Jones worked as a trade union lobbyist and was a parliamentary researcher for the Labour Party MP John McDonnell, then a backbencher, who became Shadow Chancellor in 2015. Additionally, Jones was hired by the left-wing historian Eric Hobsbawm to index and archive his papers. Writings and public career =Columnist, broadcaster and writer= Jones speaking in 2013 Jones is a weekly columnist for The Guardian after switching from The Independent in March 2014. His work has appeared in the New Statesman, the Sunday Mirror, Le Monde diplomatique and several publications with lower circulations. He writes from a left-wing perspective. In 2011, Jones published his first book, Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class, dissecting cultural stereotypes of the British working-class as boorish and anti-social \\"chavs\\". The book was selected by critic Dwight Garner of The New York Times as one of his top 10 non-fiction books of 2011, and it was long- listed for the Guardian First Book Award. The Independent on Sunday named Jones as one of its top 50 Britons of 2011, for the manner in which his book raised the profile of class-based issues. In November 2012, Jones was awarded Journalist of the Year at the Stonewall Awards, along with The Times journalist Hugo Rifkind. Jones' second book, The Establishment: And How They Get Away With It, was published in September 2014. The Daily Telegraph placed Jones 7th in its 2013 list of Britain's most influential left-wingers. In February 2013, when Jones was awarded the Young Writer of the Year prize at the Political Book Award, he donated half the ¬£3,000 prize money to support the campaign of Lisa Forbes, a Labour parliamentary candidate, and the other half to Disabled People Against Cuts. In an interview with The Student Journals, Jones commented that some have accused him of using politics only to raise his own profile and that he risks being seen as a \\"lefty rent-a-gob\\". Jones spoke at a press conference to launch the People's Assembly Against Austerity on 26 March 2013, and regional public meetings in the lead-up to a national meeting at Central Hall Westminster on 22 June 2013.Jones, Owen. \\"How the People's Assembly can challenge our suffocating political consensus and why it's vital that we do\\" , The Independent, 24 March 2013.Wotherspoon, Jenny \\"People's Assembly: Writer Owen Jones Helps Build Nationwide Anti-Cuts Movement In The North East\\" , Sky Tyne & Wear, 23 May 2013. In November 2013, he delivered the Royal Television Society's Huw Wheldon Memorial Lecture, Totally Shameless: How TV Portrays the Working Class. Jones self-identifies as a feminist, a republican, and a humanist. Jones is gay, and strongly opposes gay conversion therapy.We can‚Äôt stand silent while the right abuses free speech The Guardian =2019 assault= Jones at Policy Exchange, September 2013 On 17 August 2019, Jones said on Twitter that when having his birthday celebrations, he and his friends were attacked in a premeditated assault outside The Lexington, a North London pub. On 29 September 2019, the police confirmed that three men were arrested over the attack on Jones. On 10 October, the same three men were charged over the incident. In January 2020, one of the three men was found guilty of aggravated assault towards Jones. In July 2020, James Healy, one of the perpetrators, was jailed for attacking Jones. =Political opinions= Shortly after the publication of his first book, Jones wrote that he \\"was one of the few commentators\\" during the 2011 England riots who was \\"asked to challenge the dominant narrative that this was mindless criminality, end of story\\", and criticised how the aftermath was used to demonise working-class youth unjustly. Books * Jon Cruddas said that \\"Jones tours the country, but not as the political tourist we feared after the dinner party piss-takes. Rather, he gives voice to a working class disenfranchised by neoliberalism and electoral calculus.\\" * David Runciman said that \\"Jones is good at capturing the hypocrisy of people used to wielding unaccountable power who suddenly find themselves on the receiving end of its lash.\\" * Tom Gatti said that \\"After December‚Äôs election result, the left has (at least) a year of soul-searching ahead.

Shelburne Parish, named for the Earls of Shelburne, desired in 1771 that a minister preach at Leesburg, Virginia every three months. The absence of a glebe and glebe lands detracted from efforts to recruit a parson, so in 1773 the parish purchased and built a house on the property. The two-story brick house stands on a hilltop overlooking Goose Creek. There are five bays, of which two may have been added. A two-bay kitchen wing is appended. The interior, which by vestry order was to include one large room by and another by , follows a hall-and-parlor plan. The interior may not have been completed until after the American Revolution, as its detailing is Greek Revival in character. The property includes a number of outbuildings, including an ice house and a kitchen. Virginia ordered the sale of all glebes in 1802, but the parish resisted. Legal action was not settled until 1830, and the property was finally sold in 1840. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 1, 1975.

The protagonists are Average Joes \\" taking impossible things seriously and grave matters lightly\\".

The complex is on the site of the original log meeting house, built about 1750. The 1765 meeting house is a one-story stone building, and was converted to a residence after the construction of the 1817 meeting house. The 1817 meeting house was originally built as a two-story brick building, but was damaged in a windstorm in 1944 and its upper story was removed. The building remained unrepaired for some years after the storm because of wartime restrictions on building materials. Due to a schism in American Quakerism in the early 19th century, there was a second Quaker meeting in Lincoln. Friends from this meeting, known as \\"Orthodox\\" Friends, invited the members of Goose Creek to worship with them until the Goose Creek Meeting House could be repaired. When the repairs were completed, the two meetings reunited to form the Goose Creek United Meeting, worshipping in the now-single story 1817 meeting house. The 1817 meeting house was enlarged with the addition of a Gathering Room or First Day School room in 1982http://www.goosecreekfriends.org/ Today, the meeting house continues to be an active center for worship and the activities of the Monthly and Yearly Meetings of Friends. The schoolhouse is a one-story brick building on a stone foundation, built in 1815. Oakdale School was the first public school in Loudoun County, Virginia, and following the American Civil War was the first school in the region to offer education to African-American children. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 24, 1974.

Inscriptions on sculptures in the church show that renovations were made to the monastery in 1164 and between 1250 and 1261. Records show that the monastery suffered greatly during the period from 1743 to 1790 due to attacks carried out by Nader Shah and later Persian Muslim rulers against the Christians in the region.http://www.aina.org/aol/syriac.htm#Bihnam The monks of the monastery established contact with the Catholic Church in Rome in the late 18th century seeking protection against Nader Khan, which led to the gradual conversion of the inhabitants of Bakhdida to the Syriac Catholic Church. In 1790 the monastery was taken over by the Catholic Church and was managed for eight years until the Syriac Orthodox church retook it. For unknown reasons, the monks abandoned the monastery in 1819‚Äîlikely due to the loss of their flock in that region. The Syriac Catholic Church resumed possession of the monastery, and repopulated it in 1839; it has continued in this state to the present time with the exception of a three-year abandonment as a result of the 2014 ISIS invasions.

The troops removed crosses from the monastery, threatened monks with execution and then expelled the monks with nothing but the clothes on their backs.

Gunji is attached to Barpali village and are together called Gunji (Barpali).\\"Gunji- Barpali\\" In the north, on the other side of the hill is the village Rainkhol. Damau Dhara is located on a road between Sakti and Korba. It is approximately 14 miles from the nearest city of Sakti\\"Damau Dhara\\" which is on Kolkata- Nagpur National Highway 200. Background Damau Dhara is locally called Damau Dahra meaning 'Ravine of Damau' because a deep gorge has been made by a waterfall from a small river Gupt Godavari\\"River Name at Damau Dhara\\" that runs from Satpura Range. Damau Dhara is located at the southern extreme of Satpura Range. There is a small temple at the hill-top from where a long view is possible and one can see far off to Sakti and other places. A big mela is organized every year in the month of January (Magha in Hindi). Sadhus from many places assemble at Damau Dhara on every Solar Eclipse and take bath at the kund after the eclipse is over. However, it is the wild monkeys that take the lead to plunge into the canyon the moment solar eclipse is over. ;Legend of the Insctiption There is an inscription\\"GUNJI STONE INSCRIPTION\\" on one of the walls near the waterfall which has an ancient writing in many languages. It is said in the folklore that it has some message written in all the possible languages of the world at that time. Archeological study has dated this inscription to 1st century C.E. and the language is Pali. As per the report of Archeological Survey of Western India, Volume IV, page 146:\\"Inscription Details\\" \\"...It consists of two parts, the first of which begins with salutation to Bhagavat, and is dated on the I5th day of the 4th fortnight of Hemanta in the 5th regnal year of a king named Sri Kumara Vasanta, and contains the words Bhagavato Usubha-tithi, the name of a thera Godachha and the name Vaslthiputa. Can this last be the same Vasithiputa mentioned in the Ajanta Cave inscription 1? This would take back our record to the first half of the second Century B, C., but it is ascribed to the first Century A. D. by Mr. D. R. Bhandarkar. The second part of the inscription is dated on the second day of the 6th fortnight of Grishma in the 8th year of Kumara Vasanta's reign. Damau Dahra is just a little solitary place like Rupanath, which has an Agoka record, and a likely place which a few Buddhist monks may have selected for their residence.\\" Another attempt of study on these inscription has been done by L P Pandey in his 1966 published book Maha Kosala Kaumudi.\\"Gunji Inscription\\" In local folklore, it is also believed that anyone who can decipher the writing of all the languages inscribed there will get wealth (gold and silver kept in big bronze utensils (‡§ó‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞) having the wealth which would suffice two and half days financial transactions of the whole world) which has been submerged in Damau Dehra. The king of Sakti, Raja Bahadur Leeladhar Singh\\"Case of Sakti King's Succession\\"\\"Court Stamp of Sakti state\\" father of Raja Surender Bahadur Singh\\"Sakti State History\\" once brought Pandits from Kashi and tried that the writings be deciphered. However, the Pandits could not succeed and the king in anger fired gunshot on the writing which damaged some of the writing area. However, now government has put a tin shed above the writing of the rocks to preserve the writings.

Primrose Colliery Primrose Colliery was developed from the mid-1800s, close to the village of Rhos. After the disaster of 1853, it was redeveloped as the New Primrose Colliery, owned by Sir Ralph Howard, and by 1896 employed 307. It closed in the early 1900s, but from 1908 was revived as a pumping station for the Tarenni Colliery. Tirbach Slants The major coal seams are located close beneath the valley floor, but mean accessing steeply declining seams which run in high geological fault structures, running directly under the River Tawe. This makes the coal easily accessible, but also dangerous to extract. The first drift mine workings occurred in the late 1800s, at a site referred to at the time as the Tirbach Slants. The Pwllbach Colliery Company started development in 1898 of two slants, main and reverse, and after a series of lease changes which reverted the lease to the Pwllbach Colliery Company, production started in 1905. After the company collapsed into administration in 1924, the lease was taken over by the Pwllbach, Tirbach & Brynamman Anthracite Collieries Ltd, which in 1938 became Henderson's Welsh Anthracite Collieries Ltd. These companies all worked the same seams: Big (abandoned 1939); Peacock (or Brass); Middle and Lower seams. The workings employed 651 in 1936, the height of its production. The site was closed from February 1940 due to geological difficulties, with 500 men given notice in January 1940. At this time during World War II, labour was expensive, so it is likely that economics also played a large part in the decision to close. The mine reopened in May of that year, but had been completely abandoned by December 1940. The site then became a disposal centre for extract from the main Tarenni Colliery, and after nationalisation, the National Coal Board used it as a training site. Opened in 1903 by the South Wales Primrose Coal Co Ltd, pit No.1 called Tarenni () was sunk to work the Red vein under Ynys Wil Hernyn Farm. A sister pit further north, Gleision (Tarenni No.2, ), was sunk deeper to work the Big and Peacock veins, but faults made it difficult to work. There was a steep cross measure drift developed to connect the two shafts. Coal was distributed through access to either the Great Western Railway via the Neath and Brecon Railway, or the Midland Railway via the Swansea Vale Railway. By 1908, Tarenni employed 427 men producing anthracite, which had grown to 803 by 1918, and 947 by 1923. By 1933, the mine was producing 140,000tonnnes per annum of anthracite. From 1937, the company started development workings to check the Big vein south, sinking the No.1 shaft to . But development work stopped due to World War 2, and by 1938, there were a total of 522 men working the complex, with over two thirds deployed on No.1 shaft. The Red vein workings in No.1 were abandoned in 1941, with a further reduction of 100 men achieved by reducing workings on the Big vein to one shift. The development work on No.1 shaft continued after the war, approved for an investment of ¬£150,157 by the Ministry of Fuel and Power to access the Lower Peacock seam in a more stable area. Further investment was made by the purchase and refurbishment of a new 0-4-0WT shunting locomotive, formerly of the Great North of Scotland Railway.Tarini Colliery  Chasewater Stuff's Railway & Canal Blog But on nationalisation, the NCB concluded that the mine was uneconomic, and it was closed in February 1949 with the loss of 320 jobs. Gleision Colliery Today, only the small Gleision Colliery drift mine exists, one of three privately owned coal mines still surviving in the South Wales Coalfield. Working the same area as the Tirbach Slants, National Union of Mineworkers records suggest the development was active from 1962. The current workings of two drifts has been active from 1980, accessing the Ynisarwed seam, with miners working the face by kneeling or lying down. The main drift of provides access from a conveyor for a gauge railway, on which up to six drams at a time are moved to two surface tipplers, from which the local council have authorised access for lorries of up to 15 tonnes in laden weight. The second drift does not have rail access, and provides air circulation and emergency ingress only. Privatised in 1993, by 2001 seven men including the mine owner were working the drift, producing 200 tonnes/week. However, geological problems had resulted in the development of a deep and extensive sump system to remove water ingress, and frequent problems with gas.  Disaster history Bench in the village of Cilybebyll, in memorial for Primrose Colliery disaster of 1858, which claimed the lives of 14 miners (men and boys) and 7 horses On 13 October 1858, when the Primrose Colliery was owned by Morgan and Lewis, fumes of an engine boiler suffocated 14 men and boys, and 7 horses. According to HM Inspectorate of Mines and Quarries data, outside the Gwendraeth valley, Tarenni Colliery had the highest set of recorded incidents for coal damp and methane gas explosions. In total during its production lifetime, there were six outbursts in which three men lost their lives: one on 12 December 1914; two on 17 February 1941. On 1 November 1909, water from the abandoned Ynysgeinon pit caused the death of five miners at Tarenni No.2. =2011 disaster= On 15 September 2011, workings at the Gleision Colliery suffered a large ingress of water at 09:21. Three miners escaped to the surface, with one taken to Morriston Hospital. Mid & West Wales Fire and Rescue Service called Mines Rescue units in from across the United Kingdom, to rescue four miners located at a depth of below the surface. On the afternoon of 16 September, South Wales Police confirmed the death of all four miners.

They drove before them the Iranian-speaking Sarmatians and were followed westward by the Turkic-speaking Oghuz and Kipchaks. ‚ÄòOghur‚Äô strictly refers to speakers of the Oghur languages. It is not clear that they differed from other nomads in anything but language. The terms ‚ÄòOghur‚Äô, ‚ÄòOghuz‚Äô, ‚ÄòOnogur‚Äô and others probably derive from a Turkic word meaning approximately 'tribe'. Since we depend on scattered reports from neighboring literate societies, our knowledge of their history is poor. History The Oghurs were the first wave of Turkic-speakers to move west across the steppe. They were followed westward by the Oghuz Turks and then the Kipchaks. Most of the Oghuz turned southwest and left their languages in Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Turkey while the Kipchaks remained on the steppe and became the modern Kazakhs. From about 376, the Huns moved west onto the western steppe, raided Europe and broke up after 453. They were a very mixed group and may have included Turkic-speakers. Around 450, the Akatziri, also of unknown linguistic affiliation, lived west of Crimea and fought the Huns. The Turkic-speakers seem to have originated near Mongolia and spread westward. Some time between the third and sixth centuries the Oghurs appear north of the Aral Sea.Yuri Bregel, Historical Atlas of Central Asia, 2003, Map 6. Although they must have moved through the area, none of the usual sources describe them before they crossed the Volga. Around 463, the Turkic Saragurs attacked the Akatziri. The Onogurs, whose name in Turkic possibly ‚Äòten tribes‚Äô, are also mentioned from 463 until the eighth century when they were absorbed by the Bulgars; apparently Onogurs had lived towards the Kuban. Yet another group, the Sabirs, also appeared first in 463. They were driven west by the Avars and in turn pushed Ogurs, Onogurs, and Saragurs westward; thus Sabirs also occupied ithe Kuban area. In 500-600, Sabirs fought for and against the Persians and Byzantines and were later absorbed by the Bulgars and Khazars. Around 550 the Kutrigurs (west) and Utigurs (east) lived around the lower Don. After 635, the Oghurs founded four states. About 635 the Bulgars seem to have broken off from the Onogurs, gained control of the surrounding tribes and formed Old Great Bulgaria north of the Black Sea. About 668 this state was destroyed by the Khazars. When the state fell a group of Bulgars fled southwest to the Balkans, adopted the local language, laid the foundation for First Bulgarian Empire and gave their name to Bulgaria. Another group went north up the Volga and later formed Volga Bulgaria. They adopted Islam in 922, paid tribute to the Khazars and were conquered by the Mongols in 1236. The Chuvash people continue to speak an Oghur language which is somehow connected to that of the Volga Bulgarians. The Khazars emerged east of the Bulgars around 630 and soon replaced them. They were a mixture of Bulgars, other Oghurs, Gokturks and others. They controlled the Volga trade with Persia and Byzantium and were destroyed by the Rus' in 969. With the formation of the Bulgar and Khazar states the term 'Oghur' gradually disappears from the records, but the Oghur languages must have continued from some time. Five non- Oghur peoples passed through the area. The Huns are mentioned above. The Gokturks formed in Mongolia in 552, reached the Volga about 588 and raided Crimea in 577. They formed the Western Turkic Khaganate. As it weakened its western part contributed to the Khazars. The Avars were driven west by the Gokturks, briefly ruled the western steppe and moved on to Hungary about 580. They were also a mixed people and absorbed many Oghurs. Some time around 800 the Oghuz Pechenegs moved to the area west of the Khazars and the ancestral Hungarians passed through the area. The Oghur lands were later inhabited by the Kipchaks.

There are two key areas in the public sector in which corruption in Indonesia can be found. These are the justice and civil service sectors. Corruption within the justice sector is seen by its ineffectiveness to enforce laws, failure to uphold justice, hence undermining the rule of law. The areas of corruption within this sector include the police and the courts. In the 2008 Public Sector Integrity Survey, the Supreme Court ranked the lowest in integrity in comparison to the other public services in Indonesia.(Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, Integritas Sektor Publik Indonesia Tahun 2008: Fakta Korupsi dalam Layanan Publik, (Jakarta: Direktorat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Komisi Pemberatasan Korupsi, 2009), pg 10.) The courts were viewed to make decisions unfairly and have high unofficial costs. Evidence of corruption within the civil service comes from surveys conducted within the sector. Some surveys found out that almost half were found to have received bribes. Civil servants themselves admit to corruption. In January 2012, it was reported that Indonesia has lost as much as Rp 2.13 trillion (US$238.6 million) to corruption in 2011. A study conducted by Indonesia Corruption Watch, a non-profit organization co- ordinated by Danang Widoyoko, said that embezzlement accounted for most of the money lost and that ‚Äúgovernment investment was the sector most prone to gratification.‚Äù Companies are concerned about red tape and widespread extortion in the process of obtaining licences and permits, and they often faced demand for irregular fees or concessions based on personal relationships when obtaining government contracts. Companies have also reported regular demand for cash payments and expectations for gifts and special treatments by Indonesian officials. Economic and social costs Corruption is an important development challenge that poses economic and social costs in Indonesia. Interference in public laws and policies for the sake of personal or private gain has weakened the competitiveness of Indonesia.Vinay Kumar Bhargava, E. P. (2004). Challenging corruption in Asia: case studies and a framework for action. World Bank Publications. About one-quarter of ministries suffer from budgetary diversions in Indonesia. Households spent approximately 1% while enterprises spent at least 5% of monthly company revenue on unofficial payments. Social costs due to corruption in Indonesia include the weakening of government institutions and the rule of law. Increases in crime due to smuggling and extortion involve the institutions that are supposed to be protecting citizens. The people who suffer most are the poorMauro, P. (1997). Why Worry About Corruption? as they are pressured to finance payments through their already tight budgets and the effectiveness of social services are less accessible indirectly. These concerns were voiced by the poor urban communities of Indonesia themselves in a joint World Bank-Partnership for Governance Reform research project, entitled ‚ÄúCorruption and the Poor‚Äù.Hardjono, R. a. (2002). The Poor Speak Up; 17 Stories of Corruption, Partnership for Governance . Efforts to curb corruption Anti-corruption efforts began in Indonesia in the 1950s. There have been some efforts to battle corruption with the creation of the ombudsman and the Assets Auditing Commission (KPKPN).Stephen Sherlock, Combating Corruption in Indonesia? The Ombudsman and the Assets Auditing Commission, Volume 38, Issue 3, December 2002, pages 367-383 It has been an important agenda and part of Indonesia's official reform program since May 1998. However, the efforts made are questionable as there has been limited success to reduce corruption. Some obstacles that impeded the improvement of corruption included political and economic constraints, and the complex nature of the corruption itself.Natasha Hamilton-Hart. ANTI-CORRUPTION STRATEGIES IN INDONESIA Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, Vol.37, No 1,2001: 65-82. Following strong criticism of corruption at the beginning of the New Order regime in the late 1960s a Commission of Four was appointed by president Suharto in 1970.J. A. C. Mackie, 'The report of the Commission of Four on corruption', Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, 6 (3), 1970, pp. 87-101. The report of the commission noted that corruption was \\"rampant\\" but none of the cases it said were in need of urgent action were followed up. Laws were passed in 1999 giving the Police and prosecution service the authority to investigate corruption cases. These efforts have taken the shape of ordering corruption convicts to pay back all the money they have stolen. On 6 March 2012, the Jakarta Corruption Court sentenced Ridwan Sanjaya, an official from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, to six years in prison for rigging a tender bid for a home solar energy system project in 2009 worth IDR526 billion (US$57.86 million). This is an abnormal number in equation to other southeastern-Asian countries. The government isn't doing much for this case and the Indonesians are left to handle this on their own. Ridwan was found guilty of accepting IDR 14.6 billion in kickbacks, resulting in IDR131 billion in state losses. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) stated that it will use Ridwan‚Äôs verdict as material to develop the investigation on the graft scandal involving the Solar Home System project.

Brakemine used a beam riding guidance system developed at A.C. Cossor, while REME designed the testbed airframes. Trial launches were carried out between 1944 and 1945, and the effort wound down as the war ended. Although Brakemine would never be used in its original form, its use of the \\"twist-and-steer\\" guidance method would later be used on the more capable LOPGAP design, which, after major changes, emerged as the Bristol Bloodhound. A single Brakemine survives in the REME Museum. History Brakemine was the result of two independently developed versions of the beam riding guidance system concept. In 1942, Captain Sedgfield of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) wrote a technical paper on the concept. In 1943, Leslie Herbert Bedford, director of research at A.C. Cossor, independently developed the same idea while on a long train ride. The filing of two similar concepts led to a conference at the headquarters of Anti-Aircraft Command (AA Command), attended by General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Frederick Pile and Brigadier J.A.E. Burls, Chief Mechanical Engineer of AA Command (and inventor of the Pile Platform). A follow-up meeting started planning for a number of committees to study development of the concept, but worried that this would lead to lengthy delays, Burls decided to allow Cossor a free hand to develop the guidance system while (the now Major) Sedgfield would handle rocket development at the AA Command's workshops at Park Royal. Development began in February 1944. The Brakemine missile developed as a simple cylindrical airframe with an ogive nosecone, small elliptical wings mounted near the centre of gravity, and four small fins at the rear. The missile was powered by eight solid rockets taken from the existing Unrotated Projectile anti-aircraft rocket (also used on the RP-3); later models used six rockets. Its flight was controlled using the \\"twist-and-steer\\" method of the two main wings. These were connected to the missile fuselage with pivots, allowing them to rotate to different angles of attack. To turn the missile, the wings would first rotate in opposite directions to cause the missile to roll. Once the wings were perpendicular to the required direction, they would then be rotated in the same direction, creating lift to change its course.Aeroplane and Commercial Aviation News, Volume 93, pg. 935 A launcher consisting of a rail mounted to an QF 3.7 inch AA gun traversal mechanism was built at Walton-on-the-Naze and test firings started in September 1944. This pre-dates the Fairey Stooge, and is the first launch of an anti-aircraft missile of British design.Peter Morton, \\"Fire Across the Desert\\", Australian Govt. Pub. Service, 1989, pg. 186 Early tests resulted in numerous failures, but as the missiles fell into the ocean they could be retrieved for study and the flaws corrected. As the missile aerodynamics improved and the failure rate dropped, further launches were fitted with the guidance system, although they were not turned on. Twenty of these early designs were built and flown, shots 11 through 20 with the guidance system installed. At this point an improved missile body was introduced, and launches of the fully operational system took place. Guidance was provided by the \\"Blue Cedar\\" radar, then in testing and entering service post-war as \\"Radar, Anti-Aircraft No. 3 Mk. 7\\". A proximity fuse was ready for use, but a warhead was never tested. When the war in Europe ended in the midst of testing, the Army lost interest in the project. It was, at this time, the best-developed missile system in Britain.Journal of the British Interplanetary Society: Volume 38, pg. 179 Further development was taken up by the Ministry of Supply (MoS), who also took over development of the competing Stooge. The MoS moved the project to their rocket testing facilities at RAF Aberporth in Wales, but no further launches took place. The dozen existing Stooge test airframes were fired from Aberporth before that program also ended. Further development on both projects ended in favour of the much more powerful English Electric Thunderbird, which had little in common with either project. Brakemine would have one lasting influence on British missile development, however. The MoS was interested in a much more capable design with altitude performance to 40,000 feet (12,000 m) and selected Brakemine's twist-and-steer manoeuvering system as the basis for this greatly improved LOPGAP design developed by Fairey. Over time these early developments culminated in the Bristol Bloodhound for the RAF, which competed with the Army's Thunderbird. Description The surviving Brakemine missile at the REME Museum is about 8 feet long, 2 feet in diameter. Two wide-chord elliptical wings are mounted on either side just below the center of the missile. Much smaller rectangular fins are at the extreme rear of the airframe. The launcher consisted of a bridgework placed on the gun mounting, with two rails on top of the bridgework. The missile fuselage rode in the gap between the rails, with the rockets wrapped around the fuselage and falling away after launch. One problem with the guidance system that was not solved during Brakemine's development was its reliance on a known launch orientation providing an \\"up\\" direction. If the missile rolled during its initial flight before the guidance system activated, this direction would not be set correctly and the automated system that attempted to keep the missile centered in the radar beam would instead send out corrections that would move it further away from it.  Survivors  A single Brakemine missile is preserved in the REME Museum of Technology.

Hunter, The Indian Empire: Its People, History and Products, first published 1886, reprint 2005, Asian Educational Services, New Delhi, Umaria Coalfield, which was owned by Rewa Coalfields Limited, was nationalized in 1973. The coalfield Umaria Coalfield is a part of Central India Coalfields. The latter is spread over the districts of Surguja, Koriya (both in Chhattisgarh), Shahdol and Umaria (both in Madhya Pradesh). There are fourteen coalfields in this group, namely Korar, Umaria, Johilla(Nowrozabad), Sohagpur, Sonhat, Jhilimili, Chirimiri, Sendurgarh, Koreagarh, Damhamunda, Panchbahini, Hasdeo-Arand, Lakhanpur and Bishrampur. The group covers an area of about with estimated reserves of 15,613.98 million tonnes. The deposits are at a depth of 0-1200 meters. Therefore, extraction is mainly amenable to underground mining except a few blocks in eastern part of these coalfields which have opencast potential. In Umaria Coalfield, the Lower Gondwana rocks are well developed. The coalfield has an estimated reserve of 181.29 million tonnes, spread across six coal seams. The coals are relatively high in moisture (7-10%) and high in ash (18.6-29.4%). South Eastern Coalfields Limited operates eight mines. According to Geological Survey of India reserves of non-coking coal up to a depth of 300 m in Umaria Coalfield was 181.29 million tonnes. Kanchan Open Cast Mine is being expanded from 0.32 million tonnes per annum to 0.65 million tonnes per annum, with a peak capacity of 0.75 million tonnes per annum. The entire overburden would be backfilled. There is 4 km metalled road connecting the mine to Vindhya Mine and onwards to Nowrozabad Railway siding. Transport The Katni Umaria Railways section was opened to traffic in 1886.The line from Katni, from Allahabad on the Jabalpur line, to Umaria, then in Rewa State, was accorded priority in construction, in order to connect Umaria Coalfield to the railway system. The Bilaspur-Umaria branch line was opened in 1891, linking the entire area to the GIPR system at Katni.

Together with test it is one of the two main publications of Stiftung Warentest, the German foundation and consumer organisation. General background Finanztest was first published in 1991. It has appeared monthly since 1997, and at the present time has a circulation of 251,000 copies per month. However, according to a survey by Allensbach, a well-known institute for public opinion research, each issue is actually read by 1.3 million readers. Approximately 205,000 copies are sold to subscribers and 46,000 at newsstands every month. The magazine is free of adverts in order to ensure that it is totally independent of manufacturer influence. Hermann-Josef Tenhagen has been the editor-in-chief since 1999. There are five main thematic sections in the magazine: \\"Legal and Everyday Life Issues\\", \\"Investment and Provision for Retirement\\", \\"Home and Living\\", \\"Tax\\", \\"Health and Insurance\\". It publishes the results of investigations of financial services, for example insurance, investment products and loans, as well as advice about tax and legal issues. Every month there is an extensive section providing a comparison of interest rates for various savings products, shares and investment funds, as well as loans for buying property or a car. In addition to the regular magazine, there are several special issues each year dealing in more detail with topics of particular interest. In the recent past these included financial advice for the self-employed, taking care of elderly parents, and maximising tax refunds. The Finanztest Yearbook with summaries of the year's investigations comes out every December. Details of all the investigations and reports can of course be downloaded, in part as a paid-for service. There are also product picker databases for investment funds and statutory health insurance that are continuously updated. Working procedures and effects of its investigations The published data and reports are based on the investigations of the financial and insurance products on the market which are carried out using scientific methods by the foundation's own staff. There was a total of 85 investigations in 2010. Since more and more companies do not wish to be surveyed and refuse to provide the information requested, Stiftung Warentest now also evaluates databases and business reports, as well as relying on private providers as sources of data. In addition, specifically trained freelancers often act as customers. Mystery shoppers for example played an important role in testing out the investment advice services of banks (issue 08/2010) and the statutory health insurance providers (issue 09/2010). Finanztest's investigations very definitely have an effect on both providers and politicians. For example, as a result of unfavourable results, consumer unfriendly financial services, such as some of the private health insurance tariffs, have been taken off the market. Following repeated criticism, more customer friendly terms and conditions have also been introduced by providers offering occupational disability insurance. As a consequence of several investigations published in Finanztest, Ilse Aigner, the Federal Minister for Consumer Protection announced in December 2010 that she also intends to make use of mystery shoppers to check the reliability of investment advice offered by banks. Advertising with investigation results If they agree to abide by the specified terms and conditions and pay a one-off fee, providers are allowed to advertise using Stiftung Warentest's overall verdicts on quality and the Foundation's logos. Finanztest's official logos as used in advertising: File:Ftest_siegel_qf_schmal.gifLogo of the magazine Finanztest, landscape format, narrow File:Ftest_siegel_qf_breit.gifLogo of the magazine Finanztest, landscape format, wide File:Ftest_siegel_hf.gifLogo of the magazine Finanztest, portrait format \\"Riester\\" ‚Äì mistakes and their consequence Stiftung Warentest has a reputation for providing accurate and reliable information with relevance for consumers. If mistakes are made, the Foundation deals with them openly and honestly, as was the case in 2002, with the publication of the incorrectly calculated results for the Riester-Rente (a state-subsidised privately funded pension introduced and named after the German politician Walter Riester). The complete issue of Finanztest was withdrawn and a public apology was made. The investigation was repeated, and the new results were published. In addition, they were also made available free of charge online. It was the first and only time in the then almost 40-year history of the Foundation that this happened ‚Äì over 100,000 copies of the magazine with the corrected information were subsequently sold at newsstands and it was the most popular Finanztest issue that year. Since 2005, Finanztest has published reports every year on its latest investigations of the various Riester state-subsidised pension schemes, the Riester fund savings plans and Riester bank savings plans. Stiftung Warentest's financial experts have regularly carried out investigations of Riester loans and also the Riester home pension scheme since it was introduced.

Kramer lives in Duluth, Georgia and was a co-founder and part- owner of the Dragon*Con media convention. Kramer has also edited several works in the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Before pleading guilty in 2013 to three counts of child molestation, Kramer was the subject of a long-running legal battle that began with his initial arrest in August 2000.  Early life Kramer was born in Brooklyn, New York. He holds a Bachelor of Science in psychology from Emory College and a Master of Public Health in health administration and planning from the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University School of Medicine. In the 1980s, Kramer was former program director of the Metropolitan Atlanta Council on Alcohol and Drugs. Career =Editing= Kramer is the editor of the anthologies Dark Love and Grails (Roc Books); The Sandman: Book of Dreams by Neil Gaiman (HarperPrism); The Crow, by James O'Barr (Random House); Free Space (Tor Books); Forbidden Acts (Avon Books); Elric: Tales of the White Wolf and Pawn of Chaos: Tales of the Eternal Champion (based on the works and characters of Michael Moorcock); Dante's Disciples, Tombs, and the Dark Destiny trilogy (White Wolf); and Strange Attraction: Turns of the Midnight Carnival Wheel (Bereshith Publishing). He has also worked for over a decade as a music critic and photojournalist. =Dragon Con and other events= In 1987, he co-founded Dragon*Con, a convention dedicated to science fiction, fantasy, comics, gaming, and the popular arts. He has not been involved with Dragon Con planning or activities since 2000, but still owned 34% of the businessSimmons, Andria (November 19, 2011). \\"DragonCon faces appeal; Co-founder fights dismissal of case against event\\". Atlanta Journal-Constitution. until Kramer's relationship with the convention was ended in July 2013 in a cash-out merger. He has also chaired the 1990 Atlanta Origins convention, the 1992 Georgia World Fantasy Convention, and the Nebula Awards Weekend, and both the Atlanta World Horror Convention, and the North American Science Fiction Convention (NASFiC) in 1995. In 1999, he chaired the Atlanta World Horror Convention. Child sex offense arrests and convictions =2000 arrest= Kramer was arrested on August 25, 2000 following an investigation spurred by an anonymous tip, and charged with molesting three teenage boys. The investigation revealed that he had previously been accused of molestation in 1997 before the alleged victim recanted. Before Kramer was arrested, he had a reputation for inappropriate relationships. According to Atlanta Magazine, he \\"was constantly surrounded by young boys\\". Kramer's first attempt to serve his pre-trial detention in house arrest lasted only a week due to a reported visit by a teenage boy. After that, he was remanded to jail. Kramer subsequently suffered a spinal injury while in jail. In response to that injury, and Kramer's assertion of declining health, Judge Debra Turner allowed him to go back to pre-trial detention in house arrest in January 2001. In 2007, former congressman Bob Barr said, \\"There is an overwhelming sense of injustice that pervades all of what has happened to Petitioner Appellant Edward Kramer.\\" Protests to \\"Free Ed\\" gained the support of science fiction writers Harlan Ellison, Anne McCaffrey, Robert J Sawyer and J. Neil Schulman. Conversely, Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter said in September 2010 that Kramer had \\"done nothing but delay and blame everyone else but himself\\", agreeing with an assessment that the Georgia Court of Appeals gave in September 2007: \\"The record strongly indicates that Kramer either sought or knowingly acquiesced in the great majority of the delay and did not want a speedy trial.\\" Kramer and his lawyers disputed this, stating that he had serious health issues that prevented him from sitting through a long trial. In 2008, after seven years of pre-trial detention in house arrest, and numerous delays in his court proceedings, Kramer's travel ban was lifted. =2011 arrest= In September 2011, Kramer was arrested after Connecticut police found him in a motel room, unsupervised, with a 14-year-old boy despite being banned from contacting anyone under 18. The felony \\"risk of injury to a child\\" was added to the list of charges for which he was to stand trial. In September 2012, Kramer was being held at the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, a maximum security facility in Suffield, Connecticut, before his extradition to Georgia in January 2013. On April 26, 2013, he was denied the chance to post bail, as the presiding judge concluded based on past behavior that he was likely to break the conditions of his bond. =Guilty plea to 2000 charges= On December 2, 2013, more than thirteen years after his 2000 arrest, Kramer entered an Alford plea to one charge for each of the three victims, just before his trial was scheduled to start. In 2014, he sought to reverse the 2013 plea, with his lawyer claiming Kramer was forced into the plea bargain through prosecutorial misconduct. The Georgia State Attorney's Office ordered the recusal of both the district attorney and the Gwinnett District Attorney's Office from the case, since they were also witnesses in the action. All Gwinnett County Judges voluntarily recused themselves as well. =2019 arrest and indictment= On February 27, 2019, Kramer was arrested by officers from the Lawrenceville Police Department for allegedly taking photos of a young boy at a doctor's office. On September 18, 2019, Kramer, along with Gwinnett County Judge Kathryn Schrader, was indicted after being allowed improper access to the county‚Äôs secure computer network. Kramer was later charged with possession of child pornography as a result of that investigation. Judge Schrader was subsequently suspended from the bench, pending the outcome of a trial.

Sonhat Colliery lies north- east of Chirimiri.Shri Kamal Sharma, Resource Development in Tribal India, p. 165, 1989, Northern Book Centre, 4221/1 Ansari Road, New Delhi, History Tata Iron and Steel Company initiated prospecting of coal but no mining was carried out by them. The Chirimiri colliery was opened in 1930 (production started in 1932), New Chirimiri colliery came up in 1942, Pure Chirimiri colliery in 1945, and North Chirimiri colliery in 1946. Subsequently, New Chirimiri Pondi Hills, West Chirimiri, Duman Hill and Korea collieries started operating. Coal production rose from 264,000 tonnes in 1933 to 3,162,500 tonnes in 1980. The collieries in Chirimiri Coalfield were owned by several companies and owners such as Chirimiri Colliery Company Pvt. Ltd., Dababhoy's New Chirimiri Ponri Hill Company (Private) Limited, United Collieries Limited, K.N. Dhady and Indra Singh & Sons (Private) Limited. These were nationalized in 1973. The Coalfield Chirimiri Coalfield is a part of Central India Coalfields. The latter is spread over the districts of Surguja, Koriya (both in Chhattisgarh), Shahdol and Umaria (both in Madhya Pradesh). There are fourteen coalfields in this group, namely Korar, Umaria, Johilla, Sohagpur, Sonhat, Jhilimili, Chirimiri, Sendurgarh, Koreagarh, Damhamunda, Panchbahini, Hasdeo-Arand, Lakhanpur and Bishrampur. The group covers an area of about with estimated reserves of 15,613.98 million tonnes. The deposits are at a depth of 0‚Äì1200 meters. Therefore, extraction is mainly amenable to underground mining except a few blocks in eastern part of these coalfields which have opencast potential.

He was killed in 2010 by a stray bullet during intensive fighting between Al-Shabaab militants and AMISOM soldiers in the Battle of Mogadishu. Life and career Adan was born in Borama in northern Somalia. He was married, with three children. Adan was a veteran who had worked for 30 years in Mogadishu's radio industry. He had been working at Radio Hurma for 4 years. Death On 24 August 2010, AMISOM forces were battling Al-Shabaab rebels in Mogadishu, after a suicide bombing attack earlier in the day on the Hotel Muna killed at least 33 people.

The authorities must take concrete and urgent measures to protect journalists doing their work and innocent civilians in general.\\" Additionally, Irina Bokova, Director General of UNESCO, said: \\"The Somali press is paying an exorbitant price for the instability prevailing in the country.

It is known from the holotype AMNH 6940, a nearly complete skeleton. It was collected in the Linton site in Jefferson County, from the upper Freeport Coal Member. A. longipes was first assigned by Edward Drinker Cope in 1875 to a species of Sauropleura. The genus was first named by Robert L. Carroll and Donald Baird in 1972 and the type species is Anthracodromeus longipes.  Features and environment  Anthracodromeus was between 15 and 20 cm long when alive, with about 5 cm of this being tail. It had a long body, with 27 vertebrae between the five cervical vertebrae and the sacrum. Each vertebra had a short pair of ribs attached to it. The limbs were quite short, but each foot was at least 2 cm long - as long as the rest of the limb put together. There are 20 caudal vertebrae in the tail, but unlike the thoracic/lumbar vertebrae, these do not have neural spines. The scapulae and much of the skull are missing, as is the lower jaw. The parietals, temporals and occipitals are present, as is the edge of the eye socket, but nothing further forward than this. As we have no teeth from the specimen, it is impossible to tell what it ate, except that it must have been something quite small, probably insects or vegetation. It probably lived in swamps full of tree ferns, as were common in the Carboniferous and shown by the fact it was found in coal. It would have been a fast runner - the small size and large feet may have been an adaptation to let it walk over marshy ground, but there is no real evidence for this.

Life Eric was one of ten children of Duke John V of Saxe-Lauenburg and Dorothea of Brandenburg (1446‚Äì1519), daughter of the Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg. He came into contact with the cathedral chapter at Cologne at an early age. In 1484 it was proposed that he should study at university, so he went to Cologne and graduated in law (in particular, canon law) at the University of Cologne. In 1487, he was ordained as a priest and on 27 October 1490, he received a prebendary in Cologne. He held another prebendary in Hildesheim, where he was elected bishop on 21 May 1502. His election was confirmed by Pope Alexander VI. His consecration was scheduled for 12 July 1503, however, he resigned before that date in favour of his brother John IV of Saxe-Lauenburg, possibly because the Diocese of Hildesheim was too heavily indebted. Eric returned to his post in Cologne. In 1508, Conrad VI of Rietberg, Bishop of Osnabr√ºck and M√ºnster, died. The cathedral chapter at M√ºnster elected Eric as his successor, preferring him over Francis of Waldeck and John of Rietberg, a nephew of the late Conrad and canon at Cologne. Eric was consecrated a bishop in the same year and celebrated his First Mass, assisted by his brother John and his half-brother Bernard. Eric appointed Bernard of Saxony (died before 21 February 1549), an illegitimate son of his father (not to be confused with his legitimate brother Bernard of Saxe- Lauenburg, died 1524, Provost of Cologne and Magdeburg), as auxiliary bishop in M√ºnster. During the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud, Eric supported his brother, the Bishop of Hildesheim. This, he belonged to the League of L√ºneburg, opposing Henry the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, Eric I of Brunswick- G√∂ttingen-Calenberg, Bishop Francis of Minden, and the Knights of Saldern. Emperor Charles V imposed an imperial ban on all members of the League, including Eric. During a dispute with Count Klaus the Hedges Rider of Tecklenburg, Eric occupied the County of Lingen.

Sexual bimaturism can result in sexual dimorphism, but sexual dimorphism could also develop through differential rates of development. In many insects, the larval period of females is longer than that of males, and as a result of this extended growth period, these female insects are larger than their male conspecifics. Male simian primates are generally larger than females of the same species due in part to extended growth periods. Gorillas demonstrate a particularly high degree of sexual bimaturism. Bimaturism can refer to developmental differences within a sex related to secondary sex characteristics. For example, male orangutans reach sexual maturity around age 15 but undergo an additional period of development later in life before they exhibit cheek flanges. Flanged males are generally preferred by females so that unflanged males need different mating strategies to compete with flanged males. The onset of this second developmental phase varies greatly and may be influenced by the proximity of other flanged males. In humans, sexual bimaturism is evident in that males begin puberty later than females. This may be related to selection for later maturation in males in a polygynous mating system.

The battle was the result of a Roman attempt to open the Great St. Bernard Pass over the Alps. It was a Roman victory, but the ferocity of the fighting ended with the Roman legion moving back out of the Alps. Background When Caesar was in Gaul (57‚Äì56 BC) he sent Servius Galba with the Twelfth Legion and some cavalry to Gallia Transalpina, into the country of the Nantuates, Veragri, and Seduni. His purpose in sending this force was to protect the Poeninus Pass over the Alps. Roman merchants could travel over the pass, but were sometimes attacked and were forced to pay tolls to the mountain tribes. Galba, after taking many strong places, and receiving the submission of the people, sent two cohorts into the country of the Nantuates, and wintered with the remaining cohorts in a town of the Veragri named Octodurus, which was in a narrow valley, surrounded by mountains and divided by the Dranse river. Galba gave one part of the town to the Galli (Gauls) to winter in, and assigned the other to his troops. He fortified the Roman portion of the town with a ditch and rampart and prepared for winter. However, a few days after they moved into camp, a Gallic army attacked the fortifications. Caesar gives a number of reasons for this attack, among them a belief that the Romans would not limit themselves to keeping the pass open, anger that a number of their children had been taken as hostages, and a belief that the single under-strength Roman legion was vulnerable to attack. The battle Several days after going into winter quarters the Romans woke to find the Gallic half of the town deserted and the slopes above the town covered with a large force of Seduni and Veragri. The Roman fortifications were incomplete and he had only limited supplies. The Romans defended themselves from the fortifications for about six hours. At which time, fearing that they would not be able to keep the enemy out, they sortied. The Roman attack was successful and Caesar states that about one- third of the 30,000 tribesmen were killed. Smith mentions that due to the narrowness of the valley, the Gallic army might have been much smaller than Caesar records and that the casualty figures might also be inflated. The aftermath Despite the Roman decisive victory, Galba didn‚Äôt feel strong enough to remain at Octodurus. He was running short of supplies and worried about foraging in the Alps during winter. He may have also feared raids by the scattered fragments of the Gallic army which had retreated into the mountains. After burning the village, Galba marched out of the Alps and spent the rest of the winter in the lands of the Allobroges.

A Science Fiction Book Club edition followed from the same publisher in November of the same year. The first paperback edition was from Avon Books in July 1979. The first British edition was from Magnum, also in 1979. Later paperback editions were issued by Bantam Books in 1985 (U.S.) and Orbit/Futura in 1986 (U.K.).

A third book by the same two authors, A Cold Blue Light, 1983, is sometimes listed as the third novel of the trilogy, but is unrelated. Unattributed comments indicate that the authors wrote a conclusion which their publisher declined to publish. Plot summary In the millennium after a global war, society in the former United States has splintered into groups. The main group in the story, the Coven, live in a pre-industrial Native American lifestyle, but one of growing population and power. Many members have mild telepathic powers, which opens the corridors of power to those capable of \\"lep\\". Lep allows the Coven to form larger social groups, but isolation from these groups drives one mad. The other primary group, The City, retains their former technological lifestyle in the remains of the east coast megapolis. They spend their lives involved in immortal solitary scientific research, meeting rarely and communicating only when their research overlaps. The few thousand remaining City dwellers separate themselves from the \\"dirty\\" Coven through the use of the Self Gate, an electronic barrier that drives lesser minds insane. To protect idle attempts to breach it, the City also employs a small mercenary army to act as a police force outside the Gate. Although the Self Gate is designed to allow City folk to cross without issue, there is only one known example of this having happened. Judith Singer, a historian, learns that an ancient weapon known as the Girdle of Solitude is available in the ruins of a weapons laboratory in what was once Pennsylvania. She leaves the City in order to retrieve it, but soon after leaving she meets and falls in love with a young Coven man, Garrick. Garrick, heir to a wealthy apple-growing family of the Shando tribe, takes her as his wife. Some years later Garrick is hit by lightning, and gains lep for the first time. Looking to marry political power with his family's fortune, Garrick leaves Judith to remarry into a powerful family. His combination of wealth and power quickly makes the Shando powerful among the Coven, and rapidly improves their style of life to that of the late 19th century. Judith is heartbroken and eventually dies years later, alone and embittered. She leaves behind their son, known simply as Singer, who lives a self-imposed life of solitude. When rumours of the return of the plague reach the Shando, Garrick refuses to flee from the forests. Instead, he decides the era of isolation should end, and wants to open communications with the City. Standing between him is the mercenary army and the Self Gate. Garrick relies on two ideas to overcome the Gate. To approach the gate he will need to defeat the mercenary army protecting it, and decides to rally the disparate tribes of the Coven to build an army of his own. To attempt the Gate itself, he places his hope in the Girdle of Solitude that Judith told him about. And to achieve both of these goals he turns to Singer, who is rumored to have telepathic ability well beyond that of any Covener. Singer is captured and returned to Garrick, after briefly displaying a terrifyingly powerful lep ability. He refuses to take part in the plans, and Garrick is forced to turn to his second son, Arin, in whom he places little faith and generally dismisses. Arin assembles a party and sets off on his mission of alliance building. The party eventually reaches a non-Covener group, the isolationist Kriss, a fundamentalist Christian sect who live in and around the coal mines of Pennsylvania. Trapped in the Kriss town over winter by bad weather, the party slowly goes mad due to isolation from the larger group, culture shock, and Arin being forced to poison one of his group to prevent her from being stoned to death for her fornication with a young male Kriss. In the spring the survivors set out on the final leg of their journey, traveling to the abandoned city of Lishin. Here they are attacked by \\"the formless terror\\", diseased rats. They bite Arin's best friend, who dies a horrible death. His death and resulting complete isolation drives Arin insane. In the aftermath, Arin wanders Lishin and encounters a member of the Kriss using a syringe to collect plague from the glands of dead rats. Using his own lep he drives the man insane, and learns through him that the Kriss leader is herding the plague in order to kill the Covens using biological warfare. Moreover, the mercenary army is actually paid for and led by the Kriss, and the army is only nominally involved with City. Arin returns to Shando and relates his story. Garrick responds by gathering his army and attacking the Kriss at night, sealing the men in the mines and murdering all the women and children. He buys off most of the mercenaries by giving them the Kriss coal mines. He then turns his army on the remaining group, led by the son of the Kriss leader. They initially divide his forces and send them reeling after using a number of ancient flame throwers found outside the city. Garrick regroups, and is aided by a turncoat mercenary general who helps carry the day. Meanwhile, the Girdle has finally been retrieved by another Coven member and handed over to Arin, who turns it on and finds it to be a sort of invisibility device. He confronts the Gate and manages to make it through. Inside the City he is discovered and led to meet Judith's mother. He reveals that he is not Arin, but Singer. Singer had planted his own personality in Arin when they first met months earlier. It was the combination of the two personalities, Singer's self-loathing and Arin's youthful grandiosity evening each other out, that prevented the Gate from stopping him. The story ends with the City providing a cure for the plague, meeting with Garrick, and ending the era of solitude. Garrick, unaware of his role in the events, gives up on Singer and banishes him. Arin and Singer meet some time later, and Arin asks why he refuses to take credit. Singer relates his hatred for Garrick, including the way that he ignored Arin, his little brother, simply for being the second son. He chose to make Arin the hero to correct this. He returns to his solitary life, the true Master of Solitude.

History =Pandu Rajar Dhibi= In 1962, excavation were initiated at Rajpotadanga village, near the southern bank of the Ajay River in the area and it was extended in 1965. The excavations have revealed the traces of a 3,500-year-old civilisation similar to that of Harappa-Mohenjo-daro. There also are indications of links with the Minoan civilization of Crete.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, pp125-130, Radical Impression. The excavated items have been added to the collection of the State Archaeological Gallery. Further excavations were carried out in 1985 by the state department of archaeology. The main mound at Pandu Rajar Dhibi is associated with King Pandu mentioned in Mahabharata. The 1985 excavation has clearly shown that there were six periods of occupation at the sites. There were two main periods ‚Äì the Chalcolithic period around 1600 BC ‚Äì 750 BC, and the Iron Age. The excavation at Pandu Rajar Dhibi has provided evidence for the gradual growth of a Chalcolithic culture and its displacement by iron- using people. =Medieval history= The area between the Damodar and Ajay was known as Gopbhum, where the Sadgope kings ruled for many centuries, prior to the advent of the Muslims. The Sura kings also occupy a somewhat mythical position in the region. Adi Sura of this dynasty is credited with having brought the five Brahmins and Kayasthas (two important upper castes in Bengal) from Kannauj in what is now Uttar Pradesh.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, pp 150-151Around the 11th century, King Mahindranath ruled from his fort at Amrargar. One can see the elementary remains of the foundation of a fort. In the 18th century the area faced massive attacks of the Bargi warriors.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, pp209, 292-293 =Movements= This being a canal-irrigated area it had faced agitations against the imposition of taxes for canal water.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, p472 Damage to embankments of the Ajay and consequent flooding was a regular problem in the Ausgram and Mangalkot area. The devastating flood of 1943 caused immense suffering and lead to a mass movement for restoration/ repair of the embankments. A massive meeting was organised at Guskara in 1944, with Uday Chand Mahtab, Maharaja of Bardhaman. However, the government did not take any action,. Ultimately, the Communist Party, which had been at the forefront of agitations for some years, provided a huge work force for the purpose and completed the repair work. It laid the foundation for the party's popularity in the area.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, p482 Geography CD blocks of Purba Bardhaman district =Location= Ausgram II CD Block is part of the Kanksa Ketugram plain, which lies along the Ajay. The river forms a boundary with Birbhum district on the north for a long stretch and then flows through district. The uneven laterite territory found in the western part of Bardhaman district extends up to Ausgram and then the alluvial flood plains commence.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, p18,28, Radical Impression. The entire Durgapur-Kanksa- Faridpur-Ausgram area was densely forested even in more recent times. The influx of refugees from East Pakistan and their rehabilitation in the area, and the irrigation facilities extended by Damodar Valley Corporation led to destruction of much of the forests in the area, but some still remain.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, p38, 542 Ausgram II CD Block is bounded by Ilambazar and Bolpur Sriniketan CD Blocks, in Birbhum district, on the north, Ausgram I CD Block on the east, Galsi I CD Block on the south and Kanksa CD Block on the west. Ausgram II CD Block has an area of 360.45 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 7 gram panchayats, 113 gram sansads (village councils), 106 mouzas and 102 inhabited villages. Aushgram and Bud Bud police stations serve this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Amrargar. With water from several small streams swelling it during the monsoons, Kunur River often floods large areas of Ausgram and Mangalkot police station areas.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, p 35 Ramnabagan Wildlife Sanctuary, established in 1981 and covering an area of 0.14 km2 forms a part of Ausgram II block. Gram panchayats of Ausgram II block/panchayat samiti are: Amarpur, Balki, Bhedia, Debsala, Eral, Kota and Ramnagar.

The original core of the house, in what is now the south wing, was built about 1770. The stone house was two and a half stories tall, with three bays, one room deep. Some of the original woodwork survives in this section of the house. The house was expanded greatly by John Peyton Dulany around 1830, adding five bays in stuccoed brick, connected to the original house by a transverse hall. The interior of the new section features Greek Revival detailing. A two-story portico with Italianate columns was added in the 1850s, and the house was further enlarged with a two-story addition on the south side in the 1870s. The whole is covered with stucco, detailed with faux- painted joints. The house faces an axial lane through a park-like setting. The house's surroundings include a designed garden to the east with one of the oldest swimming pools in Virginia. The property includes a number of outbuildings, including a tenant house, spring house, servants' house, toolhouse, smokehouse and a schoolhouse, as well as a subsidiary dwelling reputed to be older than the main house. The house has remained in the hands of Dulany descendants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1972, and is operated as a bed-and-breakfast inn.

It is affiliated with Virginia Mason Health System, and is located on the campus of Virginia Mason Medical Center. Much of BRI's research aims to understand how immune cells function and why they malfunction to cause disease. BRI researchers study how immune cells contribute to rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. BRI uses translational research and clinical trials to carry its findings from the lab to the clinic, to inform how physicians diagnose and treat disease. History BRI was founded in 1956 as the Virginia Mason Research Center.\\" In 1985, Gerald Nepom became BRI's director and established its immunology research program. In 1999, BRI moved into a new, 100,000 square-foot building at the corner of Seneca and 9th Avenue, in Seattle's First Hill neighborhood. The building was named the Benaroya Research Institute in honor of donations from the Benaroya family. In the late 1990s, BRI's William Kwok and Nepom developed MHC class II tetramer technology that helps researchers find and study antigen-specific T cells. These tetramers are customized (using different HLA/peptide combinations) for use by researchers to study how the immune system responds to many different diseases and pathogens, including influenza, human papillomavirus, allergies, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. In 2016, Jane Buckner took over from Nepom and became BRI's president.\\" Nepom remained at BRI as a researcher and faculty member. Research BRI studies immune cells and immunotherapies that reprogram those cells; these therapies could inform treatments and cures for type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. BRI's uses its biorepositories of blood and specimens from individuals with autoimmune diseases and other disorders, and from healthy individuals to conduct research. BRI has eight biorepositories that contain samples dating back to the year 2000. In 2014, BRI was awarded a seven year, $27 million per-year grant to become headquarters of the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), a clinical research consortium with more than 200 research sites around the world. The ITN investigates how to retrain the immune system to tolerate organ transplants and reduce the effects of allergies, autoimmune diseases and other health issues. The ITN is directed by Nepom. BRI's Carla Greenbaum is chair of Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet. TrialNet is an international research network that is pursuing new ways to identify, slow the progression of and ultimately prevent type 1 diabetes. In 2016, BRI received a five-year, $8 million NIH grant to lead a collaboration that studies how the immune system responds to allergens in the lungs, and how those allergens trigger asthma attacks. The collaboration includes researchers from BRI, UW Medicine and Seattle Children's Research Institute. Their work could lead to new therapies for allergies and asthma. BRI is also studying immunotherapies to treat type 1 diabetes. In 2016, Buckner and her colleagues received $1 million from the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust to investigate ways to change \\"attacker\\" cells into cells that stop disease. The researchers are isolating the cells that mount autoimmune attacks, and then \\"reprogramming\\" them by editing their genes. In 2017, the Helmsley Trust awarded the researchers an additional $2 million to continue testing the edited cells in the lab. In 2017, BRI's Erik Wambre and his colleagues identified a type of cell, called Th2A, that appears to drive all allergies. This discovery could change the trajectory of allergy research and treatment by informing to therapies that target this common enemy. Th2A cells could also be used as biomarkers, or indicators to show whether a person has an allergy or is responding to therapy. In 2018, BRI's Emma L. Kuan and Steven F. Ziegler discovered that a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) helps breast cancer tumors survive and spread. They also showed that blocking this protein in laboratory models significantly inhibited the growth of breast cancer tumors and kept them from spreading. Kuan and Ziegler are investigating if drugs that block TSLP might be effective against breast cancer. In 2018, BRI researchers contributed to a finding about babies‚Äô sleep patterns: Many infants sleep better and for longer when they start eating solid foods. In the study, half the babies subsisted entirely on breast milk until six months of age, while the other half started eating solid foods at three months of age. Compared to babies who were solely breast-fed, the infants who ate solid food slept for two more hours per week and woke up two fewer times per night. The findings were published in JAMA Pediatrics, and the study was led by Gideon Lack, a professor at King's College London whose work is funded by the Immune Tolerance Network ‚Äì which is housed at BRI. In 2018, BRI's Bernard Khor was awarded an NIH grant to investigate why nearly 50 percent of people with Down syndrome (DS) have autoimmune diseases. Khor and BRI are building one of the world's first DS biorepositories to study why people with DS are so susceptible to autoimmune diseases. Dr. Khor's team will use these samples to analyze immune cells from patients with DS and patients with both DS and autoimmune disease. The researchers will compare their findings to samples from the patients‚Äô healthy family members. This could lead to insights about autoimmune diseases and inform therapies to treat them. BRI's Peter Linsley contributed to research that helped James Allison and Tasuku Honjo win the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine in December of 2018. Allison and Honjo received the prize for research related to checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cancer. Linsley is BRI's Director of Systems Immunology, and his research on T cell activation in the early 1990s significantly contributed to the body of knowledge that later helped Allison and Honjo pioneer this breakthrough approach. In March 2019, Margaret McCormick, PhD, became BRI‚Äôs Executive Director after their previous director, Homer Lane, retired. In June 2019, BRI and Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet showed that an immunotherapy drug called teplizumab delayed T1D for a median of two years for those at high risk for the disease.This is the first time scientists have been able to use a therapy to delay type 1 diabetes. BRI started conducting cancer research in 2014, in part to investigate why cancer patients developed autoimmunity as a side effect of taking checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. In 2019, BRI received two grants to learn more about this cancer-autoimmunity connection. In May 2019, they received a grant from the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, JDRF, and The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust to study why some checkpoint inhibitor patients develop an autoimmune response that resembles type 1 diabetes. In September 2019, BRI received a $4.5 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to study why immunotherapy only works for some people, and why it triggers an autoimmune response in others. In December 2019, BRI launched the Sound Life Project, which aims to profile the healthy human immune system to lay the groundwork for better ways to diagnose, treat and prevent immune system diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Scientists will examine the immune systems of healthy volunteers in two age segments (25-35 and 55-65) over two years with the goal of understanding what constitutes a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù baseline of young and aging immune systems, as well as other lifestyle and environmental factors that may influence it. The Sound Life Project is BRI‚Äôs initial project of a research collaboration led by the new Allen Institute for Immunology. BRI‚Äôs role is to provide detailed information about healthy immune systems to serve as a foundation for existing and future disease research programs. Funding and growth BRI has received United States federal grants for research for a wide variety of research projects, including research on autoimmune diseases, allergies and asthma. In 2010, BRI became the main beneficiary of the annual Boeing Classic golf tournament. The Boeing Classic has raised more than $6 million from 2005 to 2017 for BRI and other charities. In 2015, BRI ranked third in National Institutes of Health funding among Washington State research institutions. In 2016, BRI's annual budget was approximately $70 million. Approximately 71 percent of BRI's 2016 research was supported by government research grants and contracts. The remaining revenues came from philanthropic donations, pharmaceutical studies, foundation grants and other sources.

The ship was originally constructed for the Imperial Russian Navy but was taken over by the Finns during the Russian Civil War. She had originally been named Voin, but was renamed as M1 (Miinalaiva 1) in Finnish service. In 1936 she was given the more personal name Louhi, following the procedure of all other major ships in the Finnish navy. The ship was designed as a minelayer but was not particularly good at it due to its slow speed, bad seakeeping qualities and inadequate storage space. During peacetime, Louhi or M1 was used as depot ship with its storage rooms refitted as crew quarters. Louhi sunk on 12 January 1945, while returning from a mine laying operation. An explosion at the stern of the ship at 12:50 sank the ship in two minutes, with 11 casualties. From the Russian Navy to the Finnish Navy The minelayer Voin was built during World War I in Kolomna near Moscow, and it was deployed at the Baltic Sea. It was involved in a few mine laying operations, but when the Russians left Finland, it was left to the Finns and was christened M-1. It was at the time the biggest ship in the Finnish Navy fleet. Interwar period From summer of 1919, M1 amongst other Finnish naval vessels was tasked with security and patrol duties the Koivisto region where a British naval detachment was located. The aim was to provide protection to the British vessels. The British were in the area all the way until the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, operating against Russian vessels. During the 1920s and 1930s, M-1, from 1936 on Louhi, functioned as a navy training vessel and a mother ship to Finnish submarines. On 12 September 1939, Louhi was moved to the Sea of √Öland. Winter War In 1939, at the start of the Winter War, the ability of the Finnish Navy to lay mines was poor. Louhi was at the time the most efficient Finnish mine layer. The rest of the fleet that could be used in this function consisted of five mine boats of the T class, other surface vessels and submarines, and the civilian vessels commissioned by the Finnish Navy. Only Louhi was able to deploy large mine fields. The Finnish Navy laid a total of ca. 1 900 sea mines during the Winter War, of which Louhi laid about a third. It was involved most notably in laying mines in the Gulf of Bothnia, preventing the Soviet submarines from entering that area. Louhi laid mines in seaways at K√∂kar and Ut√∂ on the first night of the war. Louhi laid further mines on 3 December in the seaway near Nyhamn, but in the middle of the operation two mines exploded, and the ship had to abort its operation. laid the missing part of the mines on 4 December, and the minefield was complemented by mines from Louhi on 5 December. Louhi participated in the laying of the minebarrier to the narrows near M√§rket by laying mines there on 9 and 14 December 1939. After Soviet submarines were seen to have penetrated the barrier, Louhi on 10 January and auxiliary minelayer Baltic on 12 January laid more mines to the barrier, which was strengthened with a few kilometres of anti-submarine nets laid by the auxiliary minelayer Frej. On 3 January 1940, the Soviet submarine S-2 was sunk by the mines laid in the strait of M√§rket. On the whole, the mine laying capacity of the Finnish Navy was poor, but nevertheless it was efficient in curtailing the operations of the enemy. It is known for certainty that at least two Soviet patrol boats, one submarine and one German cargo ship were sunk by Finnish sea mines. At least one Soviet vessel is known to have been sunk by mines laid by Louhi. The Finnish mine laying operations ceased in January 1940, when the Gulf of Finland froze over. These activities were continued after the end of the Winter War, as soon as the sea ice melted, due to the fear of the Soviets launching an invasion of Southern Finland. Continuation War By the start of the Continuation War, the ability of the Finnish Navy to lay mines was improved significantly. In the spring of 1941, two state-of-the-art mine layers had been built, the mine supplies were bigger, and German influence mines of the latest design had been acquired, and Finland was also producing sea mines of its own. During the Continuation War, Finland was, in cooperation with the German Kriegsmarine, able to lay much greater and more efficient mine fields than it had been able in the Winter War. The mines laid and the submarine nets deployed between Porkkala and Naissaar caused significant losses to the Soviet Navy, and from the late summer of 1943, these devices prevented the Soviets from exiting from the eastern extremities of the Gulf of Finland. At this time, the Finnish Navy already had the new vessels Riilahti and Ruotsinsalmi, and they now took the responsibility of laying mines instead of the outdated Louhi, which served as a mother ship to submarines and an escort to merchant ships. Lapland War Louhi was sunk on 12 January 1945 after a mine laying operation in the Lapland War, in an area south of Hanko. Louhi had been laying mines together with Ruotsinsalmi, in order to prevent German Navy operations in the area. The Finnish vessels were escorted by pair of Soviet MO-boats when a large explosion wracked the stern of Louhi. The vessel sank in two minutes, taking 10 men into the depth of 40 meters, while escorting Soviet ships saved the surviving crew from the freezing sea. The sinking took place 7.5 nautical miles to the south-east of the Russar√∂ lighthouse. The sinking was thought to have been caused by a mine but it was later revealed that the had launched two acoustic homing G7es torpedoes at passing enemy ships ‚Äì one of these likely homed onto the Finnish minelayer, hitting and sinking her. Earlier it had been thought that the sinking might have been caused even by a Finnish sea mine, laid by either Finns in 1941 or Germans in 1944. However, on the basis of observations during dives to the wreck, it is now believed that the sinking was caused by a torpedo that hit the hull outside the engine room. Archival research in Germany in the new millennium revealed that the likely cause was a sound-seeking torpedo fired by U-370. The time of the firing of the torpedo by U-370 is only three minutes different from the data registered by the Finns. The lapse of time between the firing and the hit explains the time difference. The place of the sinking of Louhi has been marked in maps for a long time, but the wreck was never found at this site. However, in May 2015, Finnish divers found a wreck that they believed to be Louhi. Divers from the Finnish Navy Diving Guild visited the wreck. According to them, Louhi can be identified from the two Vickers guns. The explosion caused the deck at the rear to collapse. \\"Iron can be pretty humble stuff, when one uses enough of ammunition\\", said Petri H√§rm√§ from the diving guild. From the engine room to the bow, the deck is intact. Louhi lies upright, on its keel, on a sandy bottom. The actual site of the explosion is about 100 metres from the wreck. The ship travelled these 100 metres before it sank. In 2015, it was revealed that the commanders of U-370 and Louhi had been good friends. Louhi was commanded by Captain lieutenant Olavi Syrj√§nen, and U-370 by Oberleutnant zur See Karl Nielsen. Syrj√§nen had known many languages, and he had therefore been appointed as a liaison officer between the Finns and the Germans. Nielsen had often visited the Syrj√§nen family in Helsinki. When Louhi was sunk, Syrj√§nen was the last man rescued from the sea.

A major contributor to the sociology of knowledge and to qualitative and phenomenological approaches in sociology, he also translated from German and from French into English many important works by Georg Simmel, Emile Durkheim and Karl Mannheim. While carrying out anthropological field research in the 1940s in a small community in the southwestern United States, Wolff initially discovered, and began to articulate and to advocate, a new qualitative methodological approach for the study of human society.Wolff, K. (1964). \\"Surrender and Community Study: The Study of Loma\\". In A.J. Vidich, J. Bensman and M.R. Stein (eds.), Reflections on Community Studies, New York: Wiley. The approach later proved applicable in any field of inquiry or area of human endeavor. He called it \\"Surrender and Catch\\".Wolff, K. (1976). \\"Surrender and Catch: Experience and Inquiry Today\\". Dordrecht and Boston: D. Reidel. For more than 60 years, Wolff taught and wrote about this new approach. Karl Mannheim was Wolff's main intellectual influence,Wolff, K. (1995). \\"Karl Mannheim and Surrender and Catch: An Essay in the Autobiographical History of Ideas\\". Canadian Journal of Sociology 19(3): 371‚Äì377. yet Wolff was certainly open to a variety of intellectual currents other than Mannheimian sociology. Wolffean thought can be traced to a number of different sources in world sociology, philosophy and anthropology. Like many Central European polymaths he was fluent in a number of languages including English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. Life After graduating in Darmstadt, Wolff began his philosophical and sociological studies at the University of Frankfurt (1930‚Äì31 and 1932‚Äì33) and the University of Munich (1931‚Äì32) where he studied with Karl Mannheim. As the Nazis expelled all Jews from academic positions, he and Mannheim were forced to leave. Mannheim went to London, Wolff to Italy. In Italy, Wolff learned Italian well enough in one year to be able to study at the University of Florence from 1934-35 to obtain his Laureate (doctorate in philosophy) with a thesis titled \\"La Sociologia del Sapere.\\" Meaningful in those years was a friendship with his classmate, Aurelio Pace, the future Historian of Africa and the Joseph Pace the artist's father, who in those years helped him translate from German into Italian his doctoral thesis \\"Sociology of Knowledge\\"Alberto Izzo, Quaderni di Teoria Sociale N.3, Edizioni Scientifiche Italiane, Italia, 2003 which Wolff discusses in 1935 with Ludovico Limentani.Joseph Pace Filtranisme, una vita da raccontare, Quattrocchi Lavinio Arte, Wobook PDF pp. 17, 18 Until 1939 Wolff remained in Italy and with the support of his wife and his friend Pace got a job as a teacher, first in Florence and later in Camogli. Because of the fascist racial laws, Wolff and his wife Carla (n√©e Bruck), left Italy in 1939. After a three-month stay in London, England arranged by Mannheim, Wolff emigrated to the United States. In 1945, Wolff became a United States citizen. With financial assistance provided by the Oberlander Trust and the International Refugee Service Wolff got a position as a research assistant in sociology from 1939 to 1943 at Southern Methodist University in Texas. While there he taught an introductory course in statistics during his final year. In 1943-44 he took a Social Science Research Council Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the University of Chicago, allowing him to conduct anthropological field research in the spring and summer in New Mexico.

History  In November 1994, Boston health care attorney Kenneth Schwartz was diagnosed with lung cancer. During his 10-month illness, he discovered the importance of the human connection between caregiver and patient, saying that ‚Äúthe smallest acts of kindness made the unbearable bearable.‚Äù At the end of his life Ken outlined the organization he wanted to create. It would be a center that would promote compassion in medicine, encouraging the sorts of caregiver-patient relationships that made all the difference to him. He founded the Schwartz Center in 1995, just days before his death.  Schwartz Center Rounds  The center promotes their trademarked Schwartz Center Rounds, which they claim take place in more than 400 healthcare organizations throughout the U.S. and Canada and more than 150 throughout the U.K. The aim is to offer healthcare providers a regularly scheduled time to discuss the social and emotional issues they face in caring for patients and families, and to share their experiences, thoughts and feelings on topics drawn from actual patient cases with colleagues from other healthcare disciplines. The sessions are led by a trained facilitator, and can include over 200 healthcare professionals at a time. The premise is that caregivers are better able to make personal connections with patients and colleagues when they have greater insight into their own responses and feelings. The rounds have been shown to reduce stress in doctors who attend them, and to improve the capacity to manage the psychosocial aspects of patient care.

Early in his life Steele was a disciple of William Morris, who was apparently influential in directing young Steele's attention towards studying medieval writings, and also attracted Steele's political views towards socialism. After studying chemistry, Steele was for a brief time a teacher of this subject at Bedford School. He soon abandoned this job and moved to London where he worked as a freelance journalist, writing for various literary and socialist publications. He became a member of the Fabian Society. One of his early works, with a preface by Morris, was Mediaeval lore from Bartholomew Anglicus, a selective modernization of a medieval encyclopedia, edited‚Äîaccording to George Bernard Shaw's review‚Äî\\"with a nice sense of how much modern readers are likely to stand.\\" Steele's first major work on medieval manuscripts was The Earliest English Arithmetics, published with the help of the Early English Text Society. Later he published Early English Music Printing with the Bibliographical Society. He was able to visit France, Italy, and Russia; the latter visit helped him write The Art of the Russian Icon published with the Medici Society. His publications of Bacon's works attracted funding from several learned societies, as well as a Civil List Pension and an Honorary Doctorate from Durham University. He was also one of the early Executive Members of the International Academy of the History of Science. His house and personal library were destroyed in a German air raid in 1941. He had ten children. Steele's edition of Bacon's Secretum secretorum, with its lengthy introduction and numerous notes, is seen as the modern basis for its study by English scholars. However, Steele's view that Bacon's reading of the Secretum was the turning point towards experimentalism in Bacon's philosophy is viewed with skepticism by later scholars like S.J. Williams, who nonetheless acknowledge the special place that the Secretum played in Bacon's own writings.

Pittman played college basketball at University of North Carolina at Asheville, and was named the Big South Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year twice, in 1997 and 1998. At 6'6\\" tall, 200-pounds, he played at the shooting guard position. On May 2, 2018 he was named the new head coach for the Lexington Yellow Jackets in the Central Carolina Conference. College career Pittman, a native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, stayed in his home state to play college basketball. He attended UNC Asheville between 1994‚Äì95 and 1997‚Äì98 after graduating from high school in 1994. Through his first two seasons he only accumulated approximately 400 points and had an otherwise typical college career. Then, in his junior season with the Bulldogs, Pittman averaged 18.4 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.8 steals per game. The Bulldogs won the regular season Big South Conference championship behind Pittman's league-leading scoring average, which was also the sixth-highest average in school history. In his senior season, he averaged 18.0 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.9 steals per game. For the first time in UNC Asheville history, the men's basketball team repeated as the regular season conference champions. Consequently, Pittman became just the second Big South player (at the time) to be named the conference player of the year twice. He finished his college career with 1,547 points‚Äîthe most in the program's history‚Äîand his 175 steals were a then-school record as well. Professional career Pittman never made it to the National Basketball Association, so he decided to play professionally overseas. From 1998 until December 2001 he played in Argentina for Pe√±arol de Mar del Plata. He then signed with Italy's Bignami Castelmaggiore in January 2002, for whom he played 18 games. Pittman headed back to Argentina after signing with Quilmes de Mar del Plata. Over the course of the next 10 years, he played for various squads in Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico. In the 2012‚Äì13 basketball season, Pittman played for Juventud Sionista in the Liga Nacional de B√°squet, Argentina's First Division.

The headlights were integrated into the front wings, with headlamp surrounds that mimicked the shape of the front grille. Several of these features caught on with other auto-makers in subsequent years; headlamps integrated into the bodywork became mainstream, but in 1936 they gave the car a very modern look. The bodies were also of great technical interest. Despite its size, the Dynamic offered little comfort to traditional coachbuilders, being the first French car in the luxury class to feature a steel body electrically welded together and constructed as a monocoque, without a separate chassis. A ‚Äúsix-light‚Äù four-door saloon/sedan bodied version was offered with a long passenger cabin, but no trunk/boot. This version, introduced in the fall of 1937, could seat nine.Bellu (1996), p. 38 A four-door saloon/sedan (‚Äúberline‚Äù) was also available with a shorter passenger cabin, but with a protruding boot/trunk. The car was also unusually wide, allowing for three abreast seating: on early cars, Panhard et Levassor positioned the steering wheel in the middle of the front panel. It was hoped that this would provide a superior view out. The centrally mounted steering was probably the feature that attracted the most comment when the car appeared at the 1936 Paris Motor Show, and Panhard et Levassor advertised it as a \\"common sense\\" solution during a period when French automakers were switching over from right hand drive (which had been virtually universal in France twenty years earlier) to left hand drive (which would be virtually universal in France twenty years later).In the 1930s several conservative automakers, including Talbot and Lancia, were still doggedly producing all their cars with the steering wheel on the right regardless of whether the vehicle would end up being sold in a left hand drive or right hand drive market. However, the market-place found the central steering wheel an innovation too far and drivers complained about the contortions necessary to slide from the side of the wide car to the central position necessary to control it. From 1939 the Panhard et Levassor Dynamic featured a conventionally positioned steering wheel. Aside from the central seating position, the Dynamic was also ahead of its time in having independent wishbone front suspension. As with current supercars, the upper elements of the front suspension were mounted directly onto the engine. There were also two-seater coup√© versions and a cabriolet version offered, but by the end of 1938 these ‚Äúminority‚Äú models had accounted for only 358 cars. In addition to these and the sedans, a six-window Limousine with an available partition was introduced in 1938. Engines A first prototype, known as the Dynamic 20 CV, was presented in March 1936. This was powered by a six-cylinder in-line engine of 3,485 cm3 with cylinder diameters that indeed corresponded with the French 20 hp taxation class. However, the car that entered production and was offered for sale from May 1935 as the Dynamic 130 came with the six-cylinder in-line sleeve-valve engine of 2,516 cc from the predecessor model, the Panhard et Levassor CS. This placed it in the French 14 CV taxation class. The \\"130\\" in the name was to indicate a claimed top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). Along with the Dynamic 130, Panhard et Levassor offered a Dynamic 140, which shared its engine with the (initially still in production) ‚ÄúCS Sp√©cial‚Äù model. The engine size on this version was 2.861 cc (16 CV). Actual claimed horsepower was 75 hp (55 kW) and it was this ‚ÄúDynamic 140‚Äù that was the most popular with customers, 2,230 having been produced by 1940 when war brought production to an end. By this time the car had become the last production sleeve-valve-engined car in the world. Variants While three wheelbases were available, the shortest was largely restricted to the (soon discontinued) Coup√© Junior model and the longest to the Berline.Bellu (1996), p. 33 Most Dynamics (Majors) ended up having the 280 cm wheelbase. In 1937 Panhard et Levassor introduced a range topping ‚ÄúDynamic 160‚Äù, as a successor to the Panhard et Levassor DS. This car was fitted with a 3834 cc (22 CV) version of the Panhard et Levassor six-cylinder in-line engine, with . 153 had been produced by 1938. The small Dynamic 130 carried the X76 model code; it was discontinued for 1938. The 140 and 160 were originally called X77 and X80, after the move away from central steering for 1939 they became the X81 and X82 respectively. Commercial Panhard et Levassor Dynamics were never particularly cheap, which reflected the technological progress that they represented. However, less than six months after the October 1936 launch Panhard et Levassor updated their price list, many the prices published in February 1937 involving eye-watering increases of more than 20%. After February 1937 the short wheelbase \\"Junior 130\\" (coupe) 14CV Dynamic was priced at 53,850 Francs while prices for the four door \\"Berline 130\\" started at 58,850 Francs. For comparison, the Renault Primaquatre, admittedly an older and less flamboyant design from a manufacturer who still fitted side-valve engines in all its models, but nonetheless with an engine size and wheelbase length that also placed it squarely in the same 14CV category as the Panhard et Levassor, was priced at 22,500 Francs for a \\"Berline\\" (saloon/sedan) in October 1936, which had risen to 25,500 Francs in October 1937Bellu, Toutes les voitures fran√ßaises 1937, p. 75 Price lists from Talbot, whose Minor was launched in October 1937 with a list of 42,500 Francs for a 13CV four seater compact four door \\"Berline\\" from a manufacturer with a more modern model range, also left the listed prices for the Panhard et Levassor Dynamic looking optimistically high. Wartime production In September 1939 France declared war on Germany and in June 1940 the German Army rapidly invaded and occupied Northern France. Before September 1939, unlike Renault, Panhard et Levassor had not supplied cars to the French army, but with the outbreak of war Panhard et Levassor received an order for 182 of the larger-engined Dynamics, with the emphasis on the long cabined ‚Äúsix-light‚Äù sedans/salons. The army cars, generally reserved for senior ranks, are in most instances recognisable from the spare wheel mounted on the outside of the rear panel. Civilian versions, even with the long cabin body, kept the spare wheel inside the car. As the war progressed, Panhard et Levassor found it prudent to transfer production to their site at Tarbes in the extreme southwest, and a gazogene powered version of the Dynamic was produced albeit only in small numbers. However, following the defeat of France in June 1940 Panhard et Levassor, along with other auto-makers was increasingly obliged to manufacture military supplies.

Life  Griffin was born in 1802 in Shoreditch, London, the son of a bookseller and publisher. The family moved to Glasgow when he was young. In present-day his family members still live in, England, and he studied at the Andersonian Institution. He also received training in chemistry at Paris and at Heidelberg. In 1832 he married Mary Ann Holder, with whom he had twelve children, including William Griffin, FCS, and Charles Griffin, FSA. Griffin died at his residence, Park Road, Haverstock Hill, on 9 June 1877.  Work  Griffin commenced business in Glasgow as a bookseller, publisher, and dealer in chemical apparatus, in partnership with his eldest brother. While still a young man he published a translation of Heinrich Rose's Handbuch der analytischen Chemie. Griffin also partly edited the Encyclop√¶dia Metropolitana, of which his firm were the publishers. In 1852 the partnership was dissolved, with the publishing branch being continued by his nephew (as Charles Griffin & Co.) and J. J. Griffin establishing a firm of chemical apparatus dealers (J. J. Griffin & Sons). By the 1860s this company had established a shop on Bunhill Row and later Long Acre in London, selling both self-made and imported equipment. Through a series of mergers the company was later to develop into the major apparatus supplier Griffin & George. Griffin devised many new forms of chemical apparatus, including the common style of beaker which sometimes bears his name, and did much in introducing scientific methods into commercial processes. He was earnest in his attempts to popularise the study of chemistry, and in 1823 published his book Chemical Recreations: a popular manual of experimental chemistry, which was highly successful and went through several editions. Other books he authored include: * Treatise on the Blow-pipe * System of Crystallography (1841) * The Radical Theory in Chemistry (1858) * Centigrade Testing as applied to the Arts * The Chemical Testing of Wines and Spirits (1866 and 1872) * Chemical Handicraft (1866 and 1877) Griffin assisted in the foundation of the Chemical Society in 1840, and also helped to revive the Glasgow Philosophical Society. Nine of Griffin's papers appeared in various scientific periodicals. Of these the first was On a New Method of Crystallographic Notation; Report British Association, 1840, p. 88; and the last A Description of a Patent Blast Gas Furnace, Chemical News, 1860, pp. 27, 40.

Kolon Industries is an intellectual property lawsuit centering on the allegation that Kolon Industries (of ÏΩîÏò§Î°±Í∑∏Î£π), a South Korea-based company, stole trade secrets concerning the production and marketing of Kevlar from DuPont, an American chemical company. Kevlar is a high strength synthetic fiber used in applications as diverse as bicycle tires and body armor. On September 14, 2011, a jury found in favour of DuPont and awarded damages of $919.9 million. A 2015 settlement reduced the damages to $275 million. Background  Kevlar is a registered trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber developed at DuPont in 1965 and used commercially from the early 1970s onwards. On February 3, 2009, DuPont filed suit against Kolon for \\"theft of trade secrets and confidential information\\" relating to its product, Heracron. The suit alleged that Michael Mitchell, a Kolon employee who formerly worked at DuPont, had \\"retained certain highly confidential information on his home computer\\" that he illegally passed to his new employer. Following an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mitchell pleaded guilty to the theft of trade secrets and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment in March 2010. Destruction of evidence On July 21, 2011, the court found that Kolon had intentionally destroyed relevant evidence. Kolon was sanctioned for this behavior when evidence was produced of screenshots showing explicit instructions to delete potentially relevant emails and documents in violation of litigation holds supposedly in effect. According to a forensic analyst acting for DuPont at least 17,811 files and emails were deleted, many of which were deemed relevant to the case. As a result of this finding the jury was given an adverse inference instruction, and Kolon was ordered to pay DuPont's costs in connection with the motion. District Judge Robert E. Payne explained that \\"the actions taken by the key employees discussed herein were intentional, in bad faith and quite serious.\\" Judgment and reactions On September 14, 2011, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found in favor of DuPont which was awarded damages of $919.9 million. Kolon announced that it intended to appeal and described the judgment as \\"the result of a multiyear campaign by DuPont aimed at forcing Kolon out of the aramid fiber market\\", adding \\"Kolon had no need for and did not solicit any trade secrets or proprietary information of DuPont, and had no reason to believe that the consultants it engaged were providing such information. Indeed, many of the 'secrets' alleged in this case are public knowledge.\\" It also confirmed that it intended to continue a retaliatory antitrust case alleging monopolistic practices on the part of DuPont. Thomas G. Powell, President of DuPont Protection Technologies, said \\"The size of this award is one of the largest in defense of business processes and technologies. It also sends a message to potential thieves of intellectual property that DuPont will pursue all legal remedies to protect our significant investment in research and development and our proprietary information for the benefit of our shareholders and customers... Not only are the technologies and processes of Kevlar important to DuPont, but also to the thousands of soldiers, law enforcement officers and first responders globally whose lives Kevlar protects.\\" In a press release DuPont further stated that it intended to seek the award of costs and injunctive relief, requiring Kolon to return the stolen information and cease production of products made using the information. Appeal and settlement In 2014, a federal appeals court overturned the 2011 verdict. On April 30, 2015, Kolon Industries settled and agreed to pay $275 million in damages to DuPont. The company also pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to convert trade secrets, for which they will pay $85 million in criminal fines.

Description The painting was made on a piece of copper in the week between 15 and 22 October 1935. Mir√≥ said that the subject resulted from trying to represent the tragedy and torture of the Spanish Civil War. The painting was one of twelve known as the Wild Paintings. Half of these were painted on copper whilst the remaining six were on the type of hardboard called Masonite. These were constructed in the period of public rioting in Spain that resulted in the Civil War. Mir√≥ said this painting was about a period of unease.

Cohen (1882‚Äì1964) was a British palaeographer, historian of science, medical historian and philanthropist. Biography Dorothea Waley Cohen was born in London on 17 December 1882. Her father was Nathaniel Louis Cohen, a stock broker, and her mother was Julia Matilda Waley. The industrialist and prominent leader of the Anglo-Jewish community, Sir Robert Waley Cohen, was one of her brothers, the English jurist and economist Jacob Waley her maternal grandfather. Dorothea Cohen studied arts at Queen's College, London. In 1910 she married the physician Charles Singer. The couple later adopted two children, Andrew Waley Singer and Nancy Waley Singer. Nancy would go on to marry Edgar Ashworth Underwood, the director of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine. At the time of her marriage Dorothea already was an aspiring expert on scientific manuscripts of the middle ages, and devoted herself to numerous philanthropic activities. For Charles Singer's career, marriage to the wealthy palaeographer would prove a turning point. His first historic work, on Benjamin Marten, a precursor of Louis Pasteur, appeared in 1911. With the support of his wife Charles Singer became one the central figures of interwar history of science and medicine. In turn, by his side Dorothea Singer trained herself as a medical historian. Her first papers were co-authored with her husband, starting with a publication on the development of contagium vivum,Charles und Dorothea Singer (1913). \\"The development of the doctrine of contagium vivum, 1500-1750\\", Proceedings of the 17th international congress on medicine, London 1913, Section 23, 187‚Äì206. a concept relating to the theory of microorganisms as the cause of infectious diseases. By 1927 seven more joint papers had appeared, among them studies on the plague, the physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro and the school of Salerno. Dorothea Singer also participated very actively in the planning and implementation of the famous 2nd International Congress on the History of Science and Technology in London, 29 June ‚Äì 4 July 1931, over which Charles Singer presided.William H. Welch (1931). Diary of the William H. Welch (copy). Needham Papers, Cambridge University Library, MS Needham H.141.M. A. Dennis (1997). \\"Historiography of science: an American perspective\\". In: J. Krige und D. Pestre (eds): Science in the twentieth century. Amsterdam, pp. 1‚Äì26. In parallel she started her own line of research specializing in Medieval and Early Modern palaeography. Her discussion of over 100 plague treatises from 1348 to 1485 appeared in 1916. During Charles' absence on war service she also began to dedicate herself to the monumental project of cataloguing all medical and scientific manuscripts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the Middle Ages to the early modern era. She had found over 30,000 by the end of 1918, presenting her results at the History of Medicine Society, the first women to do so in the history of the Society. The first volume of her catalogue of alchemical manuscripts was published in 1924 by the Union Acad√©mique Internationale, focussing on the Greek manuscripts. A further three volumes appeared in the years up to 1931, dealing with Latin and vernacular manuscripts. Based on her experiences with this project Dorothea Singer gave presentations on palaeography at the University of California, where the Singers stayed in 1930 and 1932 (Charles Singer had accepted invitations as visiting professor).See e.g. Dorothea Waley Singer (1932). \\"Preparation and use of manuscript catalogues', presentation on the occasion of the meeting of the Medical Library Association, San Francisco, California, 20-22 June 1932\\", Bulletin of the Medical Library Association vol. 21, issue 2, 1932, 43‚Äì45. Dorothea Singer's card index on the project survives to this day in the Department of Manuscripts at the British Library, where it fills over 100 boxes.M. Claire Jones (2000). Vernacular literacy in late-medieval England: the example of East Anglian medical manuscripts, PhD thesis, University of Glasgow. In the early 1930s Dorothea Singer began to study the work of Giordano Bruno, producing a first draft of a monograph on the subject by 1932. Yet the escalating political crisis in central Europe increasingly absorbed the socially committed Singers, leaving little time for historical research. While Charles became active in the mission of the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning, founded in 1933 in reaction to antisemitic discrimination in Nazi Germany, Dorothea welcomed refugees and arranged for their placement. At times she herself offered English conversation lessons in an effort to help scientific refugees to become 'America ready'.Kay Schiller (2000). The refugee historian Hans Baron and the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning. In: Anthony Grenville (ed.): German-speaking exiles in Great Britain. Vol. 2. (Amsterdam: Rodopi), 59‚Äì76. After the end of World War II Dorothea Singer was able to return to her studies. In December 1946 her essay on alchemical texts under Plato's alleged authorship appeared in the journal Ambix, followed by a long treatise (in three parts) on the Scottish physician Sir John Pringle in 1949 and 1950.Dorothea Waley Singer (1949-1950). In: Annals of Science, vol. 6, pp. 127‚Äì180, 229‚Äì247, 248‚Äì261. Her intellectual biography on Bruno came out in 1950 under the title Giordano Bruno: his life and thought, containing her commentated translation of Bruno's third philosophical dialogue, De l'infinito, universo e mondi of 1584 (On the infinite, the universe and the worlds). In 1956, Dorothea Singer was awarded the George Sarton Medal jointly with her husband. For many years she served on the managing board of the Acad√©mie Internationale d'Histoire des Sciences (founded in 1928), as well as vice president of the Union International d'Histoire des Sciences, over whose bibliographical commission she presided for many years. She also was a founding member of the British Society for the History of Science and its first vice president from 1947 to 1950, as well as a member of several other academic societies. With a number of eminent scientists of her time she was in close contact, among them Julian Sorell Huxley as well as the biochemist and sinologist Joseph Needham, the greatest authority on Chinese history of science of his era. With Needham she conducted an extensive correspondence.Janus Letters from Dorothea Waley Singer to Joseph Needham, listing. The Singers resided in London until 1914, when they moved to Oxford as Charles started to work with Sir William Osler on the history of medicine. In 1920 they relocated to Highgate, London. From 1934 they rented Kilmarth, a stately home on a cliff not far from the fishing village Fowey, near Par in Cornwall. Here Dorothea Waley Singer died four years after her husband on 24 June 1964. At Kilmarth the Singers were succeeded by the novelist Daphne du Maurier.

He is also credited with inventing both the Wrebbit Puzzle Machine, which is now known as the Puzzle Shots Factory, and the Perfalock flat foam puzzle. Gallant was born in Edmundston, New Brunswick. He initially began his career in the music industry, which lasted approximately eighteen years. Gallant worked for Trans Canada Musique, Columbia Records (a division of Sony Music) and the CBC. Gallant switched careers and began working in the toy industry in the late 1980s. He began working on a new concept for the traditional puzzle, but involving 3D solutions inspired by commercial design. Gallant reportedly completed his prototype for what would be called Puzz-3D after one year of design. In 1989, Gallant laminated polyethylene foam, the same type used to insulate airliner cockpits, with paper and built his first 3D puzzle (a miniature wall) on his kitchen table. His new Puzz-3D puzzles, which often could be built into models of actual buildings and other landmark structures, could be placed on display indefinitely after completion. He founded his own company for Puzz-3D, which he called Wrebbit Inc., in partnership with Rene Binette. The logo for Wrebbit became an easily identifiable frog. The three dimensional product line was launched at the Canadian Toy & Hobby Fair in 1992. A crucial entry to the US market started when Gallant drove from Montreal to New York's FAO Schwarz, the oldest toy store in the US, in September 1991 and convinced their toy buyer to immediately order 72 puzzles. Gallant spearheaded the expansion of Wrebbit and its keystone toy, Puzz-3D, throughout Canada and elsewhere in the world. The Puzz-3D product line was made in Canada, but sold in more than 40 countries worldwide. Approximately 30 million Puzz-3D puzzles were bought by global consumers by 2000. Irwin Toys purchased Wrebbit in 2001. However, Irwin Toys went out of business in 2002 and Gallant once again became the owner of Wrebbit and Puzz-3D. Gallant sold Wrebbit and its product lines to the international toy manufacturer, Hasbro, in 2005. Gallant was awarded the Canada Export Achievement Award in 1995. The following year, he became the recipient of the Canada-America Business Achievement Award in 1996. In 2008, Gallant was inducted into the Canadian Toy Industry Hall of Fame. Gallant died on September 13, 2011, in Laval, Quebec, at the age of 67 due to brain cancer. He was survived by his three children, ten grandchildren and two sisters. His wife, Fran√ßoise, died in 2010.

Early life  James was the youngest son of Richard and Catherine Molesworth, and nephew of William John, 6th Viscount Molesworth. James was educated at Exeter and arrived in India at the age of 16 after joining the East India Company as an Ensign. His knowledge of the Marathi and Hindustani languages enabled him to serve as an interpreter for the 6th and the 9th Native Infantry regiments. He was promoted Lieutenant in 1816, and subsequently transferred to the Commissariat department. Gogate, Sharad. 'James Thomas Molesworth: A Biographical Sketch', Prefaced to Molesworth's Marathi-English Dictionary, Reprinted by Shubhada-Saraswat Publications, Pune, 1996.  The Dictionaries  In the year 1818, while Molesworth was stationed in Solapur along with his fellow interpreter Thomas Candy, the two started compiling a glossary of Marathi words. This led to the design of a comprehensive dictionary. After an initial lukewarm response to this proposal from the British Government, the work was formally begun in 1825, when (now Captain) Molesworth was stationed in Bombay. The work was simultaneously carried out for a Marathi-Marathi and a Marathi-English dictionary, (republished in 1970s by **Sharad Gogate's Shubhada - Saraswat Prakashan** ) with the assistance of the twin brothers George and Thomas Candy, and a team of native Marathi-speaking Brahmins. A preface to the first edition of the Marathi-English dictionary describes the process as follows: The manuscripts were completed in 1828. The Marathi-Marathi dictionary (titled ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡•á‡§ö‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂ a.k.a. The Dictionary of the language of Maharashtra), containing approximately 25,000 words, was printed and distributed by the Bombay Native Education Society. A delay in the printing of the Marathi- English dictionary was used to advantage by Molesworth by augmenting it to 40,000 words. It appeared in 1831, under the title A Dictionary, Murathee & English, compiled for the Government of Bombay, by Captain James T. Molesworth.  Later life  A bout of ill health prevented Molesworth from completing his next project, namely an English-Marathi dictionary, and he returned to England in 1836. As he came to believe that military service was incompatible with his calling as a Christian, he resigned from the Army and chose to forgo his pension.Rev. J. Murray Mitchell, 'In Western India', Edinburgh, 1899. He was invited to India in 1851 to prepare a revised version of his Marathi-English dictionary. This work, containing 60,000 words, was published in 1857, and since then has been reprinted several times. Molesworth's fluency in Marathi was much admired by his Indian colleagues, and his name was affectionately Indianised to 'Molesarshastri' or 'Moreshwarshastri'.David Davidson, 'Memoirs of a Long Life', Edinburgh, 1899.A. K. Priyolkar, 'Dadoba Pandurang Atmacaritra : Caritra (in Marathi), Bombay, 1947. ('Shastri' is a Sanskrit honorific derived from the word Shastra, loosely translatable as 'erudite'.) He returned to England in 1860. Molesworth was a devout Christian and contributed much effort to evangelical causes and scriptural studies. He remained a lifelong bachelor. He died in Clifton on 13 July 1871.

Composition James Blake changed his style on the EP from gospel and R&B; influenced dubstep on CMYK to more piano- based music. According to Blake, the EP is \\"more personal\\" than CMYK, and its lyrics are more focused on emotion. The EP has been described as \\"sadder and more intimate\\" than his previous releases, and as similar to Mount Kimbie's songs. The title track features some vocal static due to it being recorded on a laptop microphone. The static contrasts with the clear hand claps and bass notes. The next track, \\"Tell Her Safe\\" has Blake singing over percussion, with additional light pops and clicks, and a muffled refrain.

The film premiered on September 14, 2011 at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and then saw a limited release in the United States and Canada on March 16, 2012,‚ÄòHansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters‚Äô Delays To 2013 So Jeremy Renner More Of Global Draw Deadline Hollywood (January 9, 2012). after having been pushed back from the original date of March 2. The film received praise for its humor and grossed nearly $4.7 million worldwide. Plot Jeff (Segel) is a 30-year-old unemployed stoner living in his mother Sharon's (Sarandon) basement in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He looks for his destiny in seemingly random occurrences. He finds inspiration in the feature film Signs, which reinforces his belief in this outlook. One day, he answers the telephone; it's a wrong number, from somebody asking for \\"Kevin,\\" and Jeff contemplates the meaning of this, deciding it's a sign. Receiving a call from his irritated mother asking him to buy wood glue to fix a door shutter or find a new place to live, Jeff boards a bus, where he sees a kid wearing a sports jersey bearing the name Kevin. He follows Kevin (Ross) to a basketball court, where he joins a pick-up game and the two bond. Jeff agrees to smoke weed with Kevin, but discovers he has been tricked when he is beaten and mugged. He happens upon a Hooters restaurant where he crosses paths with his older brother Pat (Helms), a successful yuppie struggling with a failing marriage. Pat's wife Linda (Greer) is spotted at a gas station across the street with another man. Jeff and Pat spend several hours following them, first to a restaurant and later to a hotel, with Pat's new Porsche being ticketed, crashed and eventually towed away at various points in the journey. The brothers also visit their father's gravesite and fight over their conflicting life philosophies. Jeff sees a truck reading \\"Kevin Kandy\\" and runs off to hitch a ride, only to end up at the same hotel where Pat has found Linda in a room with another man. Jeff offers to break down the door. The man is a co-worker of hers named Steve (Zissis). Linda quickly ushers Steve out and then confronts Pat about his role in their problems. Frustrated, she leaves, saying she will move in with her mother. Jeff and Pat reconcile. Jeff explains how he is struggling to find his destiny in life, while Pat admits he wants to fall in love with Linda again and for her to do the same with him. Jeff encourages his brother to tell her that, and they hail a taxi to pursue her. Interspersed within the main story is the story of Sharon, who is at work, frustrated with her unfulfilled life and dissatisfaction with her sons. The doldrum is interrupted when a paper airplane with a beautiful drawing of a flower lands in her cubicle, followed by an anonymous co-worker claiming in an instant message to be a secret admirer. Sharon spends the day trying to deduce the identity of her admirer. She confides her frustrations to colleague and friend Carol (Chong), revealing that she has not dated since her husband's death. Carol encourages her to warm up to the attention she is receiving. Sharon is surprised and confused when the admirer turns out to be Carol herself, and though neither believe themselves to be attracted to their own gender, Carol appeals to Sharon's desire to become close with someone who truly understands her. At that moment, a fire alarm goes off and ceiling sprinklers activate; this is an enlightening moment for Sharon who sets off with Carol on a spur of the moment trip to New Orleans. Jeff, Pat, Linda, Sharon, and Carol all converge on a bridge, where they are stuck in standstill traffic. Pat exits the taxi and runs through the traffic to tell Linda how he feels, passing Carol's car; Sharon sees her son and runs after him, followed by Carol. As Jeff muses to the cab driver about seeking out his destiny only to find it isn't very exciting, he observes a helicopter flying overhead, jumps out of the taxi and also runs through the traffic, passing Pat, who was sharing his feelings with Linda when they were interrupted by the arrival of Sharon and Carol. Jeff continues onward to discover that the cause of the traffic is an accident in which one car plummeted over the side of the bridge. He dives into the water and rescues two children and their father; when Jeff then fails to resurface Pat dives in and rescues him. The group reconciles after the ordeal, and the audience sees Sharon celebrating her birthday and Pat and Linda apparently faring better in their marriage. Jeff sees a news report about his heroics and learns that the father of the kids he rescued was also named Kevin; now with a sense of purpose, he grabs some wood glue and fixes the door shutter.

Mann, 377 U.S. 678 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court which was one of a series of cases decided in 1964 that ruled that state legislature districts had to be roughly equal in population.. David J. Mays and Robert McIlwainehttp://www.richmond.com/obituaries/featured/article_2ddb9490-8ce4-5d0d-802a-f7ec3b53d6f6.html advocated on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia; Edmund D. Campbell and Henry E. Howell, Jr. advocated on behalf of the plaintiff Northern Virginia legislators. The Supreme Court issued the opinion in this case along with Reynolds v. Sims and cites that the opinion.  Background  Voters from Arlington County and Fairfax County, Virginia represented by Edmund D. Campbell challenged the apportionment of the Virginia General Assembly. Voters from Norfolk, Virginia represented by Henry E. Howell, Jr. were permitted to intervene as plaintiffs. On appeal, the United States (represented by Solicitor General Archibald Cox) intervened as amicus curiae to support the appellees. Under the 1962 redistricting statute, in order to keep counties and cities wholly in a district, there were wide disparities in the population of Senate and House of Delegates districts. Arlington County, for example (where Campbell and plaintiff legislators Harrison Mann and Kathryn Stone lived), was apportioned one senator for its 163,401 persons, only 0.61 of the representation to which it would be entitled on a strict population basis, while the smallest senatorial district, with respect to population, had only 61,730, and the next smallest 63,703. The District Court found \\"that the maximum population-variance ratio between the most populous and least populous senatorial districts is 2.65-to-1. Under the 1962 senatorial apportionment, applying 1960 population figures, approximately 41.1% of the State's total population reside in districts electing a majority of the members of that body.\\"Davis, 377 U.S. at 687-688.  Opinion of the Court  Having already overturned its ruling that redistricting was a purely political question in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186 (1962), the Court went further in order to correct what seemed to it to be egregious examples of malapportionment which were serious enough to undermine the premises underlying republican government. Before Reynolds, urban counties and cities, like those in which the plaintiffs resided, were often drastically underrepresented in state legislatures. This was presented as one of the defenses of the Commonwealth, but the Court rejected this defense, saying \\"Not only does this explanation lack legal merit, but it also fails to conform to the facts. Some Virginia urban areas, such as Richmond, by comparison with Arlington, Fairfax and Norfolk, appear to be quite adequately represented in the General Assembly.\\" Davis, 377 U.S. at 692. The Virginia case also presented a different argument regarding the presence of large numbers of military personnel in the affected city and counties. However, the court reject appellants' argument dismissing it as a post-hoc explanation, saying there was no evidence that the legislature considered military personnel in drawing the 1962 districts. Justice Potter Stewart issued a concurrence, in which he argued that wide disparities in population could be constitutional if the Commonwealth could articulate non- discriminatory reasons, but held that the Commonwealth could advance \\"no rational basis for the disfavoring of Arlington, Fairfax and Norfolk.\\"Davis, 377 U.S. at 695 (Stewart, J., concurring). Justice John Marshall Harlan II reiterated and adopted his dissent in Reynolds v. Sims.  Subsequent developments  The Commonwealth of Virginia redrew its legislative districts so that they were equipopulous, based on the 1960 decennial census data, in time for the 1967 elections.

Brennan initially appeared as Doug in the programme's online spin-off series Hollyoaks: Freshers, before his debut in the main show on 13 September 2010. He appeared in 5 episodes before returning on 13 January 2011 as a regular character. He was introduced as part of a new student group. His storylines have included drug dealing, a relationship with Jenny (Daisy Turner) which ended in her murder at the hands of a serial killer, an attempted suicide, and entering a civil partnership with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson). Doug has been described as someone who \\"doesn't make the best choices\\" but has the \\"best intentions\\". Doug has been described as a fan favourite and came first in a poll to find viewer's favourite of the new fresher group. Brennan decided to leave Hollyoaks in 2013 but, his exit was kept secret until transmission where Doug was killed in the show's 18th anniversary. Creation and casting Doug was created as one of three new fresher students - alongside Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and Leanne Holiday (Jessica Forrest), he was introduced through the series' online spin-off Hollyoaks: Freshers. Brennan's casting was announced on 15 July 2011. Channel 4's cross-platform commissioner Jody Smith told Alistair Houghton from the Liverpool Daily Post that the series would depict the new characters' \\"back stories and journey to Hollyoaks\\". Doug is Brennan's first television role; he auditioned in April 2010 after completing a degree at the Central School of Speech and Drama. Doug was written as an Irish character who would arrive alongside Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). Brennan hails from the US and Doug's nationality was later changed. He appeared as Doug in the main series for five episodes and then departed due to his guest role contract. Brennan told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he knew Doug would just be a \\"catalyst for changes\\" in other characters storylines. On 14 December 2010, it was announced that Doug would be returning to the series. Series producer Paul Marquess told Kilkelly that his team thought Doug was \\"great\\" and \\"brought a very different flavour\\". Brennan was asked to return in the month following Doug's on-screen debut. He had hoped for a return, but was also content with his character's initial story arc because it featured \\"a beginning, a middle and an end\\". In October 2011, Brennan revealed that he would continue to appear in the series and said that Doug would gain a more prominent role within the series. Development =Characterisation= PJ Brennan (pictured) has expressed his hope that Doug will stop acting \\"cowardly\\". A writer from E4.com described Doug as a \\"charming fresher with a dark past\\" and a \\"sly dog\\" for dalliances with two female students. Brennan told Kilkelly that Doug is a complicated person who changes over time - he is not a very good drug dealer and makes the wrong choices. He gets himself into situations by \\"his own making\\", but does have \\"the best intentions\\". Brennan explained that his character is not a bad person and he enjoyed playing him because Doug is not \\"two-dimensional\\". Doug has both a good and bad side and faces \\"ups and downs\\". Doug eventually makes an effort to change his ways. Brenndan said that a constant for Doug was his awareness of staying on \\"the straight and narrow\\". Even though he has his \\"missteps\\" - he focuses on change. Brennan felt that Doug's do-gooder actions are always based on the fact that he had hurt others and made the wrong choices. Brennan later opined that Doug had transformed into \\"quite a moral person\\". In April 2012, Brennan told Jack Mills from Wonderland magazine that Doug has \\"evolved\\". A man with \\"more barriers on the surface\\"; he was no longer the character who hooked up with ladies, \\"bragged, [...] made terrible decisions and was self-obsessed\\". Any bad judgments are not as intentional as they once were. The audience were also able to better relate to Doug's mistakes. He used to need a purpose and place to belong, which was why he dealt drugs. Brennan explained that he had finally begun to settle and \\"make real connections with people\\". One trait that the actor felt Doug need to lose was his \\"cowardly\\" persona. Doug has an inability to approach a situation directly; he avoids it and becomes a \\"bit of a shoegazer\\". Brennan said that Doug needed to \\"pull himself out of\\" his \\"avoider\\" ways. If there was any advice he could give to Doug, Brennan would warn him off going on any more blind dates. Brennan has an American accent which altered due to differing inflections, a trait which he felt fitted in with Doug's backstory of travelling abroad. Brennan told a writer from Heat that Doug's wardrobe consists of a collection of \\"itchy Christmas jumpers\\" and chinos. He added that Doug \\"must have gone crazy in Topman\\", because he sports a \\"pretty preppy\\" style. =Introduction and relationship with Jenny= Doug arrives as a new student and quickly causes trouble. Brennan told a writer from Inside Soap that \\"Doug wants as many experiences as possible. He kisses both Leanne and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark) and then gets attacked. Doug \\"has a list of suspects\\" and attempts to find out who attacked him; but ends up discovering a secret about Kevin Smith (Cameron Crighton). Brennan explained that Doug \\"is a mess\\" and sells drugs to Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki). However she climbs onto the village archway and falls off, damaging her spine as a result. The actor added that it all happened fast, but Doug did try to get Charlotte down. He \\"feels terrible\\" about being linked to her accident and takes a cocaine overdose. Brennan worried about how Doug could be redeemed after nearly causing Charlotte's death. He told Kilkelly that he expected all of the characters to reject Doug. However, Doug makes amends by replacing items he stole from his fellow students. Brennan thought that it set Doug \\"off on the right foot\\" and he had become someone that the audience could empathise with more in comparison to his initial stint. Doug is reunited with Jenny (Daisy Turner), a past holiday romance. She begins to scam Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) but instead decides to meet up with a man from an internet dating site. She meets up with him only for him to be revealed to be Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). Silas drugs Jenny before murdering her. Jenny and Doug's reunion was featured in Digital Spy's \\"Pic of the day\\" feature. Brennan commented on the storyline saying \\"I liked the surprise of the character being killed. Hollyoaks did their best to keep that a secret until the last minute, and it just heightened the whole story. We knew that we had a very small window of time to make it seem like we had a significant backstory, and I was lucky that Daisy was so giving as an actress, as we immediately had chemistry\\". Brennan went on to comment that he would like Doug to become involved in Silas's exposure saying: \\"I have my fingers crossed that Doug will be somehow involved, as I'd love him to be. When I first found out that I was going to get involved in that storyline, I was very excited. I keep saying that I hope a little bit of a Scooby Gang gets together and figures it out, as there's quite a few characters in the village who are involved in some way or another. Maybe those characters could all be brought together in solving the crimes\\". =Friendship with Riley Costello= Doug finds out that Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) has had an affair with Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Brennan commented on Doug's dilemma of whether or not to tell Mercedes' boyfriend and Carl's son, Riley (Rob Norbury), saying \\"It's very complicated because Doug doesn't want to be the one to say anything to Riley. That's partly because of the threats coming from Warren, but also because Seth (Miles Higson) knows and Doug thinks that the news would be better coming from Riley's own brother\\". Brennan commented that \\"Doug is very separate from the truth of the matter. He knows the secret, but only by chance, while Seth knows all of the people and circumstances involved. That adds to Doug's belief that Seth should be the one to tell the truth, because he's the one with first-hand information about it\\". Brennan commented on the friendship between Doug and Riley saying \\"Doug values his friendship with Riley far too much to just stand by and do nothing\\" adding that \\"Doug realises that it's do or die, and it might just have to be him that is the bearer of bad news\\". Doug is threatened by Warren not to tell Riley as he plans on blackmailing Carl. Brennan added that to Doug \\"the threats feel very real\\" and \\"the big question is whether Doug's friendship with Riley is strong enough to overpower those threats‚Ä¶\\". =Suicide attempt= On 29 November 2011 it was announced that Steph Roach (Carley Stenson) would return as part of a \\"Doug-centric episode\\" as a spirit when Doug \\"starts to feel lonely and depressed\\" in the lead up to Christmas and begins questioning whether his life is worth living. Doug decides to jump from a bridge but \\"then finds himself back at his flat with the heavenly vision of Steph before him\\". Steph begins trying to convince Doug of his positive impact on the lives of those living in the village. Brennan put Doug's depression down to Doug feeling as if he doesn't belong in the village. After Doug meets Jodie Wilde (Montana Manning) he attempts to kiss her but is rejected. Brennan said this leaves Doug feeling \\"rejected and embarrassed\\". Brennan said Doug being able to see how the village would have differed without him \\"has a big impact on him\\". He felt that it showed Doug that he does have a place in the village and will \\"give him a new perspective on life\\". =Sexuality= Doug later enters into business with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and they become good friends. As their friendship grows, Doug begins to develop feelings for Ste. Richardson told television host Myleene Klass that there was a possibility of a relationship developing between Doug and Ste. Doug helps Ste into online dating and develops \\"feelings\\" when Ste goes on a date with Adam (Alex Morgan). Richardson explained that there is confusion as to whether Doug is jealous of Ste dating a guy - or just jealous that his friend is being taken from him. Brennan told Alison Slade from TVTimes that Doug wants to \\"regain control of his life\\" after seeing Ste and Adam on their date. Doug decides to \\"go back to something familiar\\" and sleeps with Texas. Brennan told a columnist from Soaplife that it was not \\"difficult to see why these two would find solace in one another\\". This was because of the commonalities between them - a \\"strong friendship\\", a history with Brendan and endured \\"tough times\\". Doug's past romances were with females; with the pivotal one being Jenny. Brennan explained that Hollyoaks were not just \\"turning Doug gay\\". Doug rethinks what type of love he had for Jenny, but she was \\"definitely\\" very important to him. He thought that the storyline was plausible because Doug was only twenty years old and people can discover their sexuality in later life. Richardson told a writer from TV Buzz that Doug and Ste would not solely be \\"another love story\\" because Brendan will be involved. On their dynamic the actor said that \\"they put each other in their place and I think Doug stops Ste from being so moody and miserable all the time.\\" He also thought that the two men share a \\"really cute relationship\\". Brennan and Richardson often call each other outside work to discuss varied ways of playing their scenes. Ste and Brendan are known by fans under the portmanteau of \\"Stendan\\"; while Ste and Doug are referred to as \\"Stug\\". The storyline divided the audience as they supported either side. Richardson explained that Stendan fans were \\"obsessed\\" with idea of Ste reconciling with Brendan and the Stug fans wanted the opposite. He added that the two groups had \\"this little war\\" developing on social networking website Twitter. Brennan himself is gay and he told Jenna Good from Reveal that unlike Doug, it had never been an issue - but there were certain aspects of Doug's persona that he related to and sympathised with. Brennan is protective of Doug and made slight changes to the storyline. He said that because sexuality is personal to him, he wanted stereotypes and clich√©s to be avoided and do the story some \\"justice\\". The actor wanted Doug to find happiness because had a \\"very difficult\\" year. Though his story needed plenty of \\"hiccups and bumps along the way\\" to avoid boring television. Storylines Doug takes fellow students Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki), Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge) to France. Doug kisses both Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark) and Leanne Holiday (Jessica Forrest) and starts dealing drugs for Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan). He supplies Charlotte with drugs, but she falls from an archway and damages her spine. Doug feels guilty and overdoses on cocaine. While in hospital, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic), who is against Doug being in Jem's life, orders him to return to America. He does so after Carl admits that he was behind a previous attack on Doug. He later returns to make amends and settles back in. After India Longford (Beth Kingston) is murdered her sister, Texas (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove), struggles to deal with India's upcoming funeral and so begs Doug to get her some drugs. At first, he refuses; however, he soon gets the drugs off Brendan and gives her the drugs. She takes the drugs and then sleeps with Doug, but she soon regrets it. On the day of India's funeral, Texas takes more drugs and although Doug tries to help her, she was consequently unable to attend India's funeral. Brendan forces Doug to frame Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) for cocaine dealing. Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) takes Doug to a party. Riley gets drunk and drives and is pulled over by Ethan Scott (Craig Vye). Before Ethan can see who is driving, Doug and Riley switch places so Riley's career is not damaged. Doug bumps into Jenny (Daisy Turner), whom he knows as \\"Bex\\", and it is revealed he was once in a relationship with her. They decide to leave together and scam Brendan and Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). The plan fails and Jenny arranges a date with Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who she intends to drug and steal from. He realises what she is going to do and drugs her before murdering her. Doug is distraught and accuses Brendan of murdering her but he is not charged. Doug and Riley meet Ruby Button (Anna Shaffer) who lies about her identity. Doug takes Ruby to go back to the flat where they kiss, she gets drunk. Doug discovers Ruby's age and takes her home. Seth Costello (Miles Higson) confides in Doug about his father Carl's affair with Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe), behind Riley's back.

Reception Digital Spy's Kilkelly labelled him as being \\"complex\\", \\"destructive\\", a \\"bad lad\\" and \\"villain\\". He later described him as a \\"fan favourite\\" and with over two thousand votes - Doug won a poll hosted by E4 to determine the audience's favourite student character. Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton praised Doug's friendship with Riley, Ethan and Noah Baxter (Law Thomson). He said that they had formed an \\"interesting and very cute quartet\\" and liked their dynamic of boyish attitude and \\"joking around\\". He added that Doug's comfortable reaction to Noah's sexuality was positive because if it had been a US soap opera; Doug would have freaked out. Langford later opined that Doug's anger towards Ethan's negligance was realistic. However, he felt that Doug evicting Ethan from his own home was unrealistic. Sarah Morgan from the Daily Record also felt that Hollyoaks were the latest soap to use the concecpt of the film. The staff from Soaplife were surprised by Doug and Ste's gay storyline and did not see it coming because they were just \\"good friends\\". Digital Spy's readership voted their kiss as the storyline that they were most looking forward to watching. All About Soap's Carena Crawford and her colleagues had always been \\"staunch Stendan supporters\\". However, \\"Stug\\" caught their attention and decided that could make a good couple due to their chemistry. The writer opened that Doug and Ste's \\"long-awaited first kiss\\" was \\"pretty hot stuff\\" and continued in hailing them as \\"Hollyoaks hottest new couple\\". But, she would have liked to see Brendan and Ste to reunite - despite Doug and Ste's \\"undeniable\\" chemistry. Crawford concluded that \\"it's the love triangle to end all love triangles and we just can‚Äôt decide which way we want Ste to go.\\" References External links *Character profile at E4.com *Freshers Character profile at E4.com Category:Hollyoaks characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2010 Category:Fictional gay males Category:Fictional American people Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional attempted suicides ","title":"Doug Carter"},{"id":"33096620","text":"Franklin Lee Brosseau (born July 31, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player.

Early life  Harris was the eldest son of Christopher Harris of Hayne, Devon and Kenegie in Gulval, Cornwall and his wife Elizabeth Trott, daughter of Martin Trott of Langridge, Devon. While nothing is known about his educational background, on 12 May 1682 he and three other men (including John Tredenham) were granted a patent for a new device to drain water out of mines, in particular the Cornish tin mines.Boase, George Clement and William Prideaux Courtney. Bibliotheca cornubiensis: A catalogue of the writings, both manuscript and printed, of Cornishmen, and of works relating to the county of Cornwall, with biographical memoranda and copious literary references Longon: Longmans, Green, Reader and Dyer, 1874; p. 210 On 4 October 1685, he married Jane St Aubyn daughter of John St Aubyn of Clowance, Cornwall. In 1687, Harris succeeded to the estate of Hayne on the death of his father who had inherited it the previous year from his cousin, Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet, of Stowford.  Career  At the 1690 English general election, Harris was returned as Member of Parliament for St Ives and was listed as a Whig by Lord Carmarthen, and seen as a probable supporter of the Carmarthen Ministry if it were to come under attack. In 1691 Harris took his first leave of absence on grounds of ill-health, a pattern that continued throughout his parliamentary career. He did not stand for re-election at the 1695 English general election. He remained active in local politics, becoming a councilman in the new Plymouth corporation in 1696. At the 1698 English general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Okehampton,where his family had an interest, and was classed as a Country Whig. He was returned unopposed for Okehampton at the two general elections of 1701 and by December 1701 was regarded as having become more or less a Tory. He did not stand at the 1702 English general election, but served as High Sheriff of Devon for the year 1703 to 1704 and became Deputy Lieutenant for Devon in March 1705. He was defeated in a contest at Okehampton at the 1705 English general election. At the 1708 British general election he was returned unopposed again. The Whigs were unable to work out his political inclinations, but judged him a better choice than the Tory incumbent Thomas Northmore. Death and legacy Harris died on 17 October 1709 aged 57. He and his wife had three sons - Christopher, John and William, and one daughter, Jane. He was succeeded in Parliament by his son Christopher, who was also his executor.

Along with such titles as It Aint Me, Babe and Wimmen's Comix, Tits & Clits was part of a movement by female cartoonists to counter the male-dominated, often blatantly misogynistic, works of the underground.Sabin, Roger (1996). \\"Going underground\\".

The first issue appeared in July 1972, preceding Wimmen's Comix by a few months. In addition to Tits & Clits, the duo also produced a one-shot comic about reproductive rights, Abortion Eve, in 1973. The first issue of Tits & Clits sold out of its first printing of 20,000 copies by the next year. Because the series' title limited its exposure, the second issue appeared in 1973 under the title Box Comics.

With Joyce Farmer, she created the feminist comic- book anthology series Tits & Clits Comix (1972‚Äì1987) and Abortion Eve (1973), an educational comic book about women's newly-guaranteed reproductive rights.  Biography  Lyn Chevli was born in Milford, Connecticut, on December 24, 1931, as Marilyn Keith. She graduated from Skidmore College in New York and exhibited at the International Festival of Arts and Sawdust Festival as a silversmith and then sculptor. She married Narendrakumar Aditram Chevli, with whom she lived briefly in Mumbai. After moving to the U.S. she had two daughters, Neela (born 1957) and Shanta (born 1959). She and her children moved to California with her mother in 1961. She ran Fahrenheit 451 Books with her husband Dennis Madison in Dana Point, and then from Laguna Beach from 1968. The store specialized in new age literature. Chevli was the designated owner of the store because she already had a reseller license in California. Fahrenheit 451 carried the new underground comix, which impressed Chevli with their anarchic spirit, but she was concerned with their male-centered content. She sold the book store in 1972, and she and Joyce Farmer founded Nanny Goat Productions as a feminist publishing company, with the goal of giving a voice to female creators in the male-dominated and often misogynist underground comix movement. They published all-female Tits & Clits Comix in July 1972, preceding Wimmen's Comix by a few weeks. Its first printing of 20,000 copies sold out by the next year. Because the series' title limited its exposure, the second issue appeared in 1973 under the title Box Comix [sic]. Around this time, sellers of underground comix faced prosecution for selling obscene material, and the new owners of Fahrenheit 451 were arrested, though the charges were later dropped with help from the American Civil Liberties Union. The series returned to its original title in 1976, with a new issue , and continued until its seventh issue in 1987; Chevli stopped contributing after the third issue, but continued as co-editor through the sixth. In June 1973, following the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision on abortion, Chevli and Farmer published Abortion Eve, an educational comic begun the year before about women's reproductive rights. Drawing upon their experiences as birth control and pregnancy counselors at Laguna's Free Clinic, the single-issue comic book presented the stories of five women ‚Äì all of them named variations on Eve, each in differing circumstances ‚Äì going through the process of obtaining abortions. Chevli turned to prose in 1981 when she published an erotic book for women titled Alida. She wrote pieces for a number of publications, including local gay magazine The Blade. She wrote two unpublished memoirs, one about her time in underground comix and another about her life in the 1950s, when she married and moved to India. Chevli died in Laguna Beach on October 8, 2016, of age-related causes. References =Works cited=  External links * Lambiek Comiclopedia article.

She was assessed at , , 6,900 DWT. The ship was propelled by a 606 nhp quadruple expansion steam engine, which had cylinders of , , and diameter by stroke. The engine was built by the Wallsend Slipway Co Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne. It drove a single screw propeller, and could propel the ship at . History Inanda was launched on 24 February 1925, and was completed in May. She was built for the Charente Steamship Co Ltd and placed under the management of T & J Harrison Ltd. Her port of registry was Liverpool. She was allocated the United Kingdom Official Number 137410 and Code Letters KSNF. On 3 February 1932, Inanda was on a voyage from London to the West Indies when she suffered a broken propellor. She put into Swansea, Glamorgan for repairs. Following the changes to Code Letters in 1934, Inanda was allocated GLMB. In August 1936, Inanda brought George \\"Dod\\" Orsborne and his brother James back to the United Kingdom from Georgetown, British Guiana, where they had taken the Grimsby trawler without authority. Inanda was a member of Convoy OA 7, which departed from Southend, Essex on 19 September 1939 and dispersed at sea on 22 September. She was bound for Antigua, where she arrived on 3 October. She departed that day and sailed to Saint Kitts, arriving later that day. On 4 October, Inanda sailed for Grenada, arriving on 6 October and departing that day for Trinidad, where she arrived the next day. On 9 October, she sailed for Demarara, British Guiana, arriving the next day and departing on 14 October for Trinidad, where she arrived on 15 October. Departing on 20 October, Saint Vincent and Grenada were visited before Inanda arrived at Saint Lucia, from where she sailed on 25 October for Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. She arrived on 2 November, sailing on 8 November as a member of Convoy HXF 8, which arrived at Dover, Kent, United Kingdom on 21 November. Inanda was carrying general cargo, rum and sugar.

She spent the next few weeks sailing around the West Indies, arriving at Bermuda on 20 May. Carrying general cargo, Inanda was a member of Convoy BHX 64, which departed on 7 August and joined with convoy HX 64 on 12 August. Convoy HX 64 departed from Halifax on 8 August and arrived at Liverpool on 23 August. Inanda was bound for London, which was reached by leaving the convoy and sailing to the Methil Roads, where she arrived on 24 August. She then joined Convoy FS 262, which departed on 25 August and arrived at Southend on 27 August. Inanda was then hired by the Royal Navy for use as an ocean boarding vessel. On 7 September, she was berthed at London Docks when she was sunk in an air raid. She was salvaged and rebuilt as a cargo ship. Inanda was renamed Empire Explorer, she was passed to the MoWT and placed under the management of T & J Harrison Ltd.

Lecture. Psychological stress is an inevitable part of life. Human beings can experience stress from an early age. Although stress is a factor for the average human being, it can be a positive or negative molding aspect in a young child's life. A certain amount of stress is normal and necessary for survival. A few stressors can be manageable for young children; stress can be beneficial by helping children develop skills needed to adapt to a new set of circumstances and deal with dangerous and intimidating situations. Some experts have theorized that there is a point where prolonged or excessive stress becomes harmful and can lead to serious health effects. When stress builds up in early childhood, neurobiological factors are affected. In turn, levels of the stress hormone cortisol exceed normal ranges. This theory however is based on animal studies and cross- sectional studies in humans, and the proposed impacts on brain centers have not been found in a landmark twin study and studies where neurobiological factors were measured in humans prior to stress or trauma exposure. Researchers have proposed three distinct types of responses to stress in young children: positive, tolerable, and toxic. These labels are based on theorized differences in lasting physiological changes occurring as a result of the intensity and duration of the stress response. Stress is caused by internal or external influences that disrupt an individual's normal state of well- being.Effects of Stress on the Body  Lachina. (n.d.). Retrieved April 9, 2018, from https://lachina.com/blog/effects-stress-body/ These influences are capable of affecting health by causing emotional distress and leading to a variety of physiological changes. Internal stressors include physiological conditions such as hunger, pain, illness or fatigue. Other internal sources of stress consist of shyness in a child, emotions, gender, age and intellectual capacity. Childhood trauma has lifelong impact. Exposure to adverse childhood experiences can include separation from family, home violence, neighborhood violence, mental illness or substance use disorder of caregiver, physical/sexual abuse, neglect divorce, a new home or school, illness and hospitalization, death of a loved one, poverty, natural disasters, and adults‚Äô negative discipline techniques (e.g. spanking). Additional external stressors include prenatal drug exposure, such as maternal methamphetamine use, other maternal and paternal substance abuse, maternal depression, posttraumatic stress and psychosis.  Levels of stress Researchers have proposed three different levels of stress seen in children during early childhood; positive, tolerable and toxic. Positive stress is necessary and promotes resilience, or the ability to function competently under threat.Davies, Douglas. \\"Chapter 3: Risk and Protective Factors: The Child, The Family, and Community Contexts.\\" Child Development, A Practitioner's Guide. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press. Print. Such stress arises from brief, mild to moderate stressful experiences, buffered by the presence of a caring adult who can help the child cope with the stressor. This type of stress causes minor physiological and hormonal changes to the young child; these changes include an increase in heart rate and a change in hormone cortisol levels. The first day of school, a family wedding or making new friends are all examples of positive stressors. Such experiences can promote healthy development within an environment of supportive relationships, giving children the chance to observe and practice healthy responses to stressful events. Tolerable stress comes from adverse experiences that are more intense in nature but short-lived and can usually be overcome. The body's stress response is more intensely activated due to severe stressors. Some examples of tolerable stressors are family disruptions, accidents or a death of a loved one. It is important though to realize that such stressors are only tolerable when managed the correct way. Tolerable stress can turn into positive stress. With appropriate care from adults, young children can easily cope with tolerable stress and turn it into positive stress. However, if adult support is deficient in a child's coping stages, then tolerable stress can become detrimental. Toxic stress can occur when experiences are long in duration and intensity. Children need caring and supportive adults to help them because it is difficult for children to handle this type of stress on their own. Therefore, the stress response may be activated from weeks to months or even years. Prolonged stress leads to adverse effects such as permanent emotional or developmental damage. If sufficient support is not available, this type of stress can result in permanent changes in brain development. Research has found that children experiencing severe and long-term abuse have smaller brain sizes. If the situation is not as severe, toxic stress will still alter the stress response system; these changes will cause children to react to a wider variety of stressors. However, with sufficient care and support from adults, children can return their stress levels to tolerable or good. Examples of toxic stress are abuse, neglect, violence and overall hardship without adult support. Toxic stress can have a cumulative effect on physical and mental health. Allostatic load is \\"the wear and tear on the body\\" that accumulates as an individual is exposed to repeated or chronic stress. It represents the physiological consequences of chronic exposure to fluctuating or heightened neural or neuroendocrine response that results from repeated or chronic toxic stress. The term was coined by Bruce McEwen and E. Stellar in 1993. Stages of stress Stress is encountered in four different stages in early childhood. In the first stage, stress usually causes alarm. Next, in the second or appraisal stage, the child attempts to find meaning from the event. Stage three consists of children seeking out coping strategies. Lastly, in stage four, children execute one or more of the coping strategies. However, children with lower tolerance for stressors are more susceptible to alarm and find a broader array of events to be stressful. These children often experience chronic or toxic stress. Causes Children from a lower socioeconomic status are more prone to exposure to all the early life stress listed above. Socioeconomic status can be measured by education and income level. A chronic exposure to stress will lead to the decline of physical health and increase susceptibility to diseases.Fagundes, Christopher P., and Baldwin Way. \\"Early-Life Stress and Adult Inflammation.\\" Current Directions in Psychological Science 23.4 (2014): n. pag.

These neurobiological systems of the body help maintain viability and are necessary for survival in early childhood and along the course of life.Gunnar, Megan, and Karina Quevedo. \\"The Neurobiology of Stress and Development.\\"Advance (2007): 145-65. Annual Reviews. Web. 8 October 2011. . When a child or adult experiences a stressor, the body will attempt to regulate the stress through releasing hormones that pass through the body. However, effects of the prolonged or frequent biological stress response may increase the risk for future physical and mental health problems in early childhood. Since, brain circuits are vulnerable in early childhood, early stressors may impact the development of necessary brain connections. Therefore, the theory of toxic stress is that stress might alter or impair brain circuit formation and essentially result in a small brain size in young children. There are however no studies yet that have measured these brain circuits or volumes of brain centers prospectively in young children to prove this theory. Stress response pathway in humans In humans, the stress response pathway consists of the sympathetic-adrenomedullary (SAM) system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). The SAM system is a part of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system. These systems are responsible for releasing epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE), also known as the flight or fight response hormones. When epinephrine is released it will bind to various receptors in various target organs; this will exhibit multiple roles in the fight or flight mechanism. The HPA system is responsible for producing glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex; the main glucocorticoid in humans is the steroid hormone cortisol. In contrast to epinephrine, which takes a short amount of time for production, cortisol takes up to 25 minutes to reach peak levels. Also, cortisol is able to penetrate the brain through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, unlike epinephrine. Therefore, cortisol takes more time to form, but impacts the brain for a longer period of time. In conjunction, the SAM and HPA systems work to regulate stress and unite at the hypothalamus, which in turn regulates behavior. =The sympathetic adrenomedullary system= In humans, there are chromaffin cells in the adrenal glands (medulla) that get stimulated through the sympathetic nervous system during a stress response. These cells release the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine (NE). Epinephrine and NE bind to receptors of target organs and instigate the fight or flight response. As an example, epinephrine increases heart rate and causes blood vessels to dilate in muscles and blood vessels to constrict in the skin and gut. This allows a sufficient amount of blood to access the brain and muscles. Also, epinephrine initiates the breakdown of glycogen in the liver, in turn increasing blood glucose levels. This energy source allows humans to enact defensive responses due to stress. =The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system and cortisol= In the human body, the steps that lead to the release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol begin with the release of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP). These hormones travel through the blood vessels to the anterior pituitary gland of the brain. At this location, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released. ACTH binds to the receptors in the adrenal glands, which are located atop the kidneys, and this causes the release of cortisol. Cortisol enters the cytoplasm of cells in the body, including the brain. The hormone then reacts with receptors inside of the cell. The activated receptors reach the nucleus of the cells and regulate the transcription of genes. Eventually, the body experiences physiological and behavioral changes. Because cortisol hormone enters the cell's nucleus, the effects of change take longer to occur, and last for a longer period of time, compared to the hormones of the SAM system. The effect of cortisol depends upon the type of receptor that it interacts with inside of the cell. There are two glucocorticoid receptors; one is the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and another is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Normally, when cortisol is outside of the brain, it will bind to GRs. When cortisol is within the brain cells, it will bind to GRs and MRs. However, cortisol and other glucocorticoids bind more readily to MRs. Cortisol's varying affinity toward GR and MR plays an important role in distinguishing between normal and stress responses by the HPA system. When cortisol is in its basal range, more MRs are bound to cortisol than GRs. GRs are predominantly bound when humans wake from sleep or experience stress. Therefore, GRs arbitrate most of the stress effects of cortisol and glucocorticoids in other species, while MRs control most basal effects. Often, cortisol and GR effects oppose the cortisol and MR effects. This leads many researchers to speculate that early childhood (and adult) stress resilience and weakness entail the ratio of MR to GR activation. Research has found that GRs impair neural flexibility and the processes involved in learning and memory. In contrast, MRs increase the synaptic plasticity. Therefore, the effects of frequent and prolonged stress responses from the HPA system may cause detrimental results. Infancy, early childhood, and stress When the body undergoes a stressful situation, the stress hormone cortisol is released. Cortisol helps the body prepare for stressful and dangerous situation. It gives a quick burst of energy, heightened memory and lower sensitivity to pain, among other things.Cortisol and Stress: How Cortisol Affects Your Body, and How To Stay Healthy in the Face of Stress. Stress and Stress Management - Causes, Symptoms, Stress Relief Tips and Stress Tests. Retrieved from http://stress.about.com/od/stresshealth/a/cortisol.htm. When cortisol is present in the body at high levels and for extended periods of time, however, the body's immune response may be suppressed. This leaves the developing bodies of children extremely vulnerable to damage and illness. Cortisol is usually bound to proteins in adults. The protein is called the corticosteroid- binding globulin (CBG). In newborn babies, CBGs remain low and increase during the first six months after birth. Therefore, as the amount of CBGs increase, more cortisol becomes bound to the CBGs. Due to this occurrence, plasma and total cortisol levels increase. Although there are low levels of cortisol at birth, the levels are sufficient to have serious physiological effects. Newborns do not manifest typical adult circadian rhythms in cortisol production. Usually, newborns have peak cortisol levels every 12 hours and this does not depend on the time of day. After three months of life, babies begin to experience the adult cortisol production patterns, an early morning cortisol peak and low evening levels of cortisol. These cortisol rhythmic changes occur throughout infancy and early childhood, along with changes in sleep patterns. The activity of the HPA stress system adapts by repeated exposure to stressful stimulation. As newborns progress through the early months of life, babies experience increased cortisol levels during medical examinations. This is physically characterized by the fussing and crying of babies. After three months of life, babies do not respond to physical examinations with the HPA stress response system. However, babies can still respond to behavioral distress. As another example, if blood is drawn from a baby, the baby experiences an increased cortisol level. When this process is repeated 24 hours later, the same increase in cortisol is observed. In addition, during the first year of life, it becomes difficult to induce cortisol level increases to some mild stressors. These stressors include the approach of a stranger, strange events, few-minute separations from parents, and more. The decreased sensitivity of the HPA stress response may be due to physiological changes that occur in the system during early ages. The physiological changes that may occur include improved negative feedback regulation of the HPA system, and decreased sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to ACTH. Also, the availability of adult support for young children helps safeguard the activity of the HPA stress system. Many experiences can cause structural changes in the HPA system. The effects of repeated increases in cortisol levels have been researched in many animal studies, but these outcomes are also representative of humans, including young children. It has been determined that when glucocorticoids, including cortisol, are placed into various parts of the brain for many days, CRH is produced in increased quantities. In turn, this causes fear behaviors, increased caution, and activation of the SAM system. Eventually, these effects may cause posttraumatic stress disorder, in young children. A more serious psychological symptom seen in children, PTSD manifests symptoms such as, heightened fear and anxiety, loss of interests, flashbacks, lacking some emotions, paranoia.PTSD in Children. Dendrite Forest, Inc. Retrieved from http://www.forests.com/ptsdchil1.html. Other serious psychological symptoms of stress seen in children are depression, anxiety, low self-confidence and dysregulated aggression.Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009). The Effects of Violent Experience and Maltreatment on Infants and Young Children. In CH Zeanah (Ed.). Handbook of Infant Mental Health‚Äî3rd Edition. New York: Guilford Press, Inc. pp. 197-214. Stress in children has the greatest effects on the developing brain. The brain is the primary stress organ because it controls all of the stress mechanisms.Wittmer, D. S., & Petersen, S. H. (2006). In Infant and toddler development and responsive program planning: A relationship-based approach (pp. 72-73). Upper Saddle River, N.J: Pearson/Merrill Prentice Hall. Children's brains are constantly growing and developing. Therefore, their brains are very vulnerable and stressors can have great impacts on the brain that are irreversible. Research has shown that children who have experienced extended periods of extreme stress have smaller brains and high difficulties in memory tasks. Cognitive functioning is greatly impaired.McEwen, B. S. Effects of Stress on the Developing Brain. The Dana Foundation. Retrieved from https://dana.org/news/features/detail_rop.aspx?id=33204. Children who had experienced more intense and lasting stressful events in their lives posted lower scores on tests of spatial working memory. They had more trouble navigating tests of short-term memory as well. The region of the brain that is most affected by increased levels of cortisol and other glucocorticoids is the hippocampus. Many times the physical structure of the hippocampus is altered with excessive amounts of cortisol. Dendrites in this section of the brain can shrink and this leads to cell or neuron death. The shortening of dendrites and the loss of neurons in the hippocampus make a significant impact on the HPA stress response and on cognitive processes that involve the hippocampus. In the HPA system, many of the glucocorticoid receptors become non-functional when there are increased levels of cortisol. If increased cortisol levels persist in a child's early years of life, the hippocampal damages will produce collective and detrimental effects over the life of the individual. Stress has an outstanding effect on cognition, particularly memory. Episodic memory, or memory associated with remembering specific events, is mostly affected. When levels of glucocorticoids or cortisol increase, some cells in the hippocampus do not die. Instead, the activity of the neurons is changed. This creates problems with memory. Research has found that infants and young children with higher cortisol levels produce smaller electrical changes in their brain when they are forming memories. This impairs new memory formation. In addition, children who have increased levels of cortisol, during daycare or nursery school time, experience extreme hardship upholding attention. Maintaining attention is a part of self-regulation, and these children are not able to regulate their behaviors due to the high cortisol levels. Therefore, memory, attention-span, and self-regulation are influenced by cortisol production. Many children experience stress for prolonged amounts of time. Usually these factors are toxic stress and can be due to internal or external stressors. If a child has a sufficient support system, then he or she can display resilience. Often, children do not have skills to be resilient themselves, and they do not have adults for constant loving care. In these situations, children experiencing stress exhibit persistent effects of varying cortisol levels. Some children manifest low levels of cortisol production, and some experience high cortisol levels. The children with higher levels of glucocorticoids are prone to have the most problems with physical, social, mental, and motor development. Research has not yet determined whether these effects are permanent, however, it has been found that children experiencing stressful situations after the first four to six months of life endure from intellectual and social problems. Also, persistent stress in young children makes the stress regulation mechanisms deviate from normal coping mechanisms. For children experiencing good or tolerable stress, stress instigates an increase in cortisol levels. When the situation is resolved, cortisol levels will return to normal. =Toxic stress= Toxic stress is a term coined by pediatrician Jack P. Shonkoff of the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University to refer to chronic, excessive stress that exceeds a child's ability to cope, especially in the absence of supportive caregiving from adults. Learning to cope with mild to moderate stress is a part of normal development in children; however, extreme, long-lasting stress in the absence of supportive relationships to buffer the effects of a heightened stress response can produce damage and weakening of bodily and brain systems, which can lead to diminished physical and mental health throughout a person's lifetime. Extreme exposure to such toxic stress can result in the stress response system becoming more highly sensitized to stressful events, producing increased wear and tear on physical systems through over-activation of the body's stress response. This wear and tear increases the later risk of various physical and mental illnesses. In children experiencing persistent toxic stress, functioning occurs in a fear state and this becomes habitual. Many times, cortisol levels do not reach basal ranges after the situation has been mitigated. With chronic toxic stress, children undergo long term hyper-arousal of brain stem activity. This includes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and arousal states. Also, these children may experience a change in brain chemistry, which leads to hyperactivity and anxiety. Therefore, it is evident that chronic stress in a young child's life can create significant physical, emotional, psychological, social and behavioral changes. Other symptoms and effects of stress on children =Physical= Stress may make the body more susceptible to infections, cardiovascular problems such as heart disease and high blood pressure, obesity, slower healing, viruses and gastrointestinal problems.WebMD.

Retrieved from http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-symptoms-effects_of- stress-on-the-body. Stress can affect children's growth and development, including the onset of puberty. Some of the physical cues that may be indicative of stress in children are rashes on skin and skin diseases such as eczema, acne and hair loss, worsening asthma, insomnia or hypersomnia, frequent headaches, muscle aches, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea. Extreme fatigue, chest pain, racing heartbeat, shaking, cold and clammy hands and feet, frequently ill, and even ulcers are some other physical symptoms manifested due to stress. =Emotional= When children cannot handle stress they may begin to develop emotional problems. They may become severely depressed, lacking in energy and motivation. They may develop strange personality traits such as violence and disobedience. Personality disorders may arise as well. Posttraumatic stress disorder may come about in children who have experienced stressors that are traumatic such as abuse or neglect. =Psychological= Changes in mood or personality, increased irritability or aggressiveness are some psychological symptoms indicative of stress in children. Frustration, feelings of guilt or confusion, isolating themselves from family and friends. Children may also exhibit symptoms of anxiety. They may begin to have new fears and nightmares or even paranoia.[19] They may lie to others to avoid situations to cover up their feelings. Most often anxiety in children stems from academic stressors and being overwhelmed with responsibilities with workload. However, anxiety also stems from more serious stressors as well. =Social= Children under extreme stress tend to withdraw from their family and friends. They spend more time alone and lack motivation.

They may have difficulties in paying attention and act with anger and irritability towards others. =Behavioral= Children may exhibit behavioral symptoms such as over- activity, disobedience to parental or caretaker's instructions. New habits or habits of regression may appear, such as thumb-sucking, wetting the bed and teeth grinding. Children may exhibit changes in eating habits or other habits such as biting nails or picking at skin due to stress. They may become more accident-prone, cry more often, stutter, or get into fights. Long-term effects of stress on children The ACE Pyramid represents the conceptual framework for the ACE Study, which has uncovered how adverse childhood experiences are strongly related to various risk factors for disease throughout the lifespan, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The landmark Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (ACE Study) conducted between 1995 and 1997 on 17,337 participants by Dr. Vincent Felitti from the Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization and Dr. Robert Anda from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated the association of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) with health and social problems as an adult. Participants were asked about the following types of childhood trauma: * Physical abuse ‚Äì US Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 * Sexual abuse ‚Äì US Hotline: 1-800-656-4673 * Emotional abuse * Physical neglect * Emotional neglect * Violent treatment from mother * Household substance abuse ‚Äì US Hotline: 1-800-662-HELP (4357) * Household mental illness * Parental separation or divorce * Incarcerated household member The ACE study found that ACEs have a dose‚Äìresponse relationship with many health problems. As researchers followed participants over time, they discovered that a person's cumulative ACEs score has a strong, graded relationship to numerous health, social, and behavioral problems throughout their lifespan, including substance use disorders. Furthermore, many problems related to ACEs tend to be comorbid, or co-occurring. Preventing stress in children Recommendations offered to help prevent stress in children include: # Helping children prepare for everyday stressful situations, such as traveling to new places or going to the doctor. # Talking to children about the experience to help them understand that it is okay to be stressed and scared. # Keeping communication open. This includes making sure that the child feels comfortable talking to a person. This may include being in a comfortable space, such as their bedroom, where they feel safe. The comfort level of the child is important because if a child is not comfortable, or feels forced to speak, they may not open up at all. # Spending time together as a family so that no one's feelings go unseen; ensuring that a child knows that their feelings are valued, and should be expressed in healthy ways is very important ways. Reassuring children that they can come to you with whatever it is that is upsetting them is a valuable bond that will only grow as time goes on. # Modeling healthy and successful coping mechanisms for children (such as going for a walk). # Encouraging children to express themselves creatively (as an outlet or to help others to understand what is stressing the child). Some healthy outlets of stress relief include sports or running, writing, reading, art, as well as playing musical instruments. # Teaching children to act and think positively when they are faced with a situation to manage the stress before it becomes overwhelming. # Providing a safe and healthy home and environment for children. # Providing children with proper nutrition and attention. # Ensuring children are not exposed to substance abuse or violence.Peddicord, S. (2009). Prevent Early Childhood Stress. LIVESTRONG.COM. Retrieved from http://www.livestrong.com/article/7960-prevent-early-childhood-stress/ When a healthy environment is provided, children are more likely to be emotionally and physically healthy. Helping children cope with stress Recommendations offered to help children cope with stress include: # Asking children if something is wrong or what is bothering them. # Listening and trying to understand where the children are coming from (sometimes they may just need to talk). # Listening to their side and not interjecting with things that they should have done or did wrong. # Taking notice of the child's behaviors and feelings and expressing interest in hearing what is bothering them. # Casually asking children why or what they are upset about, naming the emotion you feel they are experiencing. (e.g., \\"You seem to be mad about what happened after school yesterday.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you still sad about that?‚Äù) # Talking about solutions to stress with children (providing ideas and encouraging children to come up with a few on their own to help foster confidence in their own coping abilities). # Helping the child to think and act positively. # Encouraging the child to develop positive habits to deal with stress. # Showing patience, as children may not be forthcoming with their emotions due to stress.Lyness, D.

Sherman Hsu, Ph.D. \\"Handbook of Instrumental Techniques for Analytical Chemistry\\" Prentice-Hall, New Jersey, 1997, 262. is an infrared spectroscopy sampling technique used on powder samples without prior preparation. The sample is added to a sample cup and the data is collected on the bulk sample. The infrared light on a sample is reflected and transmitted at different amounts depending on the bulk properties of the material. Diffuse reflection of the incident light produced by the sample's rough surface reflection in all directions is collected by use of an ellipsoid or paraboloid mirror. Shape, compactness, refractive index, reflectivity and absorption of the particles are all characteristic of the material being analyzed. If the sample is too absorbent, then it can be diluted with a nonabsorbent material such as potassium bromide, potassium chloride, etc. The particle size should be smaller than the wavelength of the incident light in order to minimize Mie scattering, so this would infer that it should be less than 5 ¬µm for mid- infrared spectroscopy. The spectra are plotted in units of log inverse reflectance (log 1/R) versus wavenumber. Alternative plots of Kubelka-Munk units can be used, which relate reflectance to concentration using a scaling factor. A reflectance standard is needed in order to quantify the reflectance of the sample because it cannot be determined directly.

He went on to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore where he earned a Ph.D. in Social Relations in 1971. From 1971 to 1984, Professor S√∏rensen taught at the University of Wisconsin, serving as department chair in Sociology from 1979 to 1982.

From 1994 until his injury, he was chair of Harvard's Joint Doctoral Program in Organizational Behavior. Sorensen's main contribution involved theories of how social and economic inequality reflects the unequal distribution of opportunities and social resources. His work offered a sociological alternative to some economic theories that see inequality as a result of differences in training and education. Instead, he argued that the benefits of education and training depended on whether jobs were available on a freely competitive basis or whether access to them was restricted in various ways. Persistent inequalities, he argued, occur when individuals and groups are able to limit access to jobs, education and other opportunities. Sorensen died in Boston, having been in poor health since February 2000, when he was injured in a fall on ice near his home. He was survived by his wife Annemette, director of the Henry A.

Morton Livingston Schamberg (October 15, 1881 - October 13, 1918) was an American modernist painter and photographer. He was one of the first American artists to explore the aesthetic qualities of industrial subjects.. Schamberg is considered a pioneer of the Precisionism art movement, and one of the first American adopters of Cubist style.. Early life and education Schamberg was born in Philadelphia on October 15, 1881... He was the youngest child in a German Jewish family.. His German-born father, Henry, was a cattle dealer; his mother (born in Pennsylvania) died when he was a child. Schamberg graduated from Philadelphia's Central High School. He earned a degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania in 1903. In 1902, however, he had discovered an interest in art when he attended a class taught by William Merritt Chase in the Netherlands. He took another class with Chase during the summer of 1903, in England, and then studied under him for three years at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. It was through Chase's classes that he met fellow student Charles Sheeler, who would be his close friend for the rest of his life. Schamberg met up with Sheeler in Italy in 1908 and together they studied works of the Renaissance masters. Schamberg moved on to Paris later that year, where he became an associate of Leo and Gertrude Stein's circle of avant-garde artists and writers. Schamberg's earliest works were heavily influenced by Chase. After studying the works of European artists in Paris, however, his style shifted to modernism, with influences from C√©zanne, Matisse, and Picasso evident in his works created between 1909 and 1912. He returned to Philadelphia in mid-1909, and he and Sheeler rented studios in the same downtown building as well as a farmhouse in rural Bucks County for use on weekends and during the summer. Career Telephone (1916). Oil on canvas, Columbus Museum of Art. God (1917), by Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven and Morton Livingston Schamberg, gelatin silver print, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston Schamberg had his first solo art show in mid-1910, at the McClees Galleries in Philadelphia. The show included his early landscapes and some of his larger scale portraits; these were mostly of his friend Fanette Reider and were painted between 1908 and 1912. Around 1912, he began working as a photographer to earn money, initially as a portraitist before focusing on urban architecture. Schamberg participated in the landmark 1913 Armory Show in New York, showing five of his modernist paintings. By 1915, Schamberg began painting mechanical forms, possibly through the influence of New York Dada artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia. These late paintings ranged from precise illustrations to variants on Cubist, Fauvist and Futurist styles. The only sculptural work credited to Schamberg that reflects a 'pure' Dadaist sensibility is the assemblage God, but this attribution has been questioned by art historians who believe he photographed it, but that it was a collaboration with Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. Schamberg was a pacifist, and his distress over World War I ultimately caused him to drop the subject of machines to work in watercolors, only one of which has survived: a still life of a bowl of flowers. An associate of art collector Walter Conrad Arensberg, Schamberg exhibited a painting and a drawing in the first show of Arensberg's Society of Independent Artists, in 1917. Death Schamberg died October 13, 1918 in the 1918 flu pandemic and was buried on October 15, which would have been his thirty-seventh birthday. He had been living in a Philadelphia hotel with his father, who also died in the pandemic. Exhibitions *Paintings by Morton L.

His writings are focused on \\"how-to\\" type books within the automotive hobby. Early career Before authoring his first book, Wickham began his apprenticeship in 1990 at an automotive shop in Austin, Texas. This shop, owned and operated by Mike Domoracki, specialized in competitive frame off restorations of 55-58 Chevrolets.Wickham, Ken,Standard Guide to Building Street Rods and Custom Cars, Kause Publications, WI, 2002, pp.6-7, This apprenticeship lasted approximately four years. Wickham commented that this training was crucial to both his writings and business. At any national Chevy event, dozens of 1957s would be entered into competition. The question quickly becomes how to differentiate winners from losers. Wickham said that it often came down to how much detail and accuracy went into the restoration. He learned at the Stainless Shoppe that every nut and bolt was important and had to be accurately accounted for in order to win. In 1994, Wickham left this shop to form an automotive restoration business of his own. In the same year, he restored a 1954 Pontiac convertible to show standards and used it to promote his business.Wickham, Ken,Modern Techniques for Auto Restoration, Kause Publications, WI, 1998, pp.5-6, It was during this year, where he joined the Pontiac Oakland Club International and became the club's restoration advisor. As the restoration advisor, Wickham published a series of articles in the club's publication Smoke Signals. The first set of articles were focused on his own restoration project, but the articles gradually drifted into an \\"ask and answer\\" format that resembled the Dear Abby columns that originated in the 1950s. During these years, members of the club would mail in questions with photographs and Wickham published the answers in upcoming issues of the magazine.Wickham, Ken,Restoration Basics, Smoke Signals, January 1995, pp.16-18 These articles also inspired related columns, not authored by Wickham, where members shared their restoration methods and ideas. The articles ran from 1994‚Äì1996, and terminated for unknown reasons. Wickham later recalled that these articles inspired his first book. Professional writing career In 1998, Krause Publications of Iola, Wisconsin, published Wickham's first book, Modern Techniques for Auto Restoration. The book focuses on how to find good classic cars and perform tasks from the basics all the way up to frame-off restorations. The author received criticism by some for using the book to attack environmentalism or environmental laws. The author explains in the foreword of the book that his criticisms of environmental laws were in response to the concerns of his readers and questions he received at national car shows. Other reviews of the book were complimentary. In 2002, Krause Publications was purchased by F+W Media, but still published books under the Krause Publications (KP) name. In that same year, Krause offered Wickham's second book, Standard Guide to Building Street Rods and Custom Cars. The book fits into the publisher's set of \\"Standard Guide\\" book themes by various authors and ranging in a wide variety of subjects. The book is longer and more detailed than his first book and covers a similar automotive theme intended to help readers with building hot rods and custom cars. In general, the book appeared to be well received by readers and the reviews were positive. In 2004, Wickham completed restoration of a 1957 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing. This car has been verified by the Mercedes-Benz Club of America as being the last 300SL coupe ever manufactured. In this same year, the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance car show accepted 300SLs into the show for the first time. Before 2004, gullwings were not allowed entry, but the show changed that ruling in 2004 to celebrate the gullwing's 50th anniversary. Wickham's '57 scored third place. In 2005, KP published Ken Wickham's third book, Building Street Rods, All You Need to Know. Although the subject matter appears to be similar to his second book, the third book clearly departs in format. This book is entirely in color (the other two are black and white) with a broader spectrum of photographs supporting the material. There are not enough book reviews to gauge how it was received by the automotive community. Post writing career No other books are known to exist from this author after 2005. According to the publisher, he is alive and living in Texas.

It is a Saturn-mass planet consisting of half gas and half rock and ice, and it orbits a binary star, Kepler-16, with a period of 229 days. \\"[It] is the first confirmed, unambiguous example of a circumbinary planet ‚Äì a planet orbiting not one, but two stars,\\" said Josh Carter of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, one of the discovery team. Kepler-16b was discovered using the space observatory aboard NASA's Kepler spacecraft. Scientists were able to detect Kepler-16b using the transit method, when they noticed the dimming of one of the system's stars even when the other was not eclipsing it. Furthermore, duration of transits and timing all the eclipses and transits of Kepler-16b and its stars in the system has allowed for unusually high precision in the calculations of the sizes and masses of objects in the Kepler-16 system. The leader of Kepler-16b's discovery team, Laurance Doyle of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, said of this precision, \\"I believe this is the best-measured planet outside the solar system\\". For example, Kepler-16b's radius is known to within 0.3%, better than that of any other known exoplanet (as of September 2011). Kepler-16b is also unusual in that it falls inside the radius that was thought to be the inner limit for planet formation in a binary star system. According to Sara Seager, a planetary expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it was thought that for a planet to have a stable orbit around such a system, it would need to be at least seven times as far from the stars as the stars are from each other. Kepler-16b's orbit is only about half that distance. As seen from Earth, Kepler-16b ceased transiting the dimmer star in 2014, and will stop crossing the second, brighter star in 2018. After that, Kepler-16b will remain undetectable using the transit method until around 2042. Kepler-16b orbits near the outer edge of the habitable zone,https://sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/planetary-habitability-laboratory- upra/library/notes/exoplanetscontinuouslywithinthehabitablezone but it is probably a gas giant with surface temperatures around . Characteristics =Mass, radius and temperature= Kepler-16b is a gas giant, an exoplanet that is near the same mass and radius as the planets Jupiter and Saturn. It has a temperature of .http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_Kepler-47(AB)_c.png The planet has a radius of 0.77 , slightly smaller than Saturn, and has no solid surface. =Host stars= NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program \\"travel poster\\" for Kepler-16b The planet orbits in a circumbinary orbit around a (K-type) and (M-type) binary star system. The stars orbit each other about every 41 days. The stars have masses of 0.68 and 0.20 and radii of 0.64 and 0.22 , respectively. They have surface temperatures of 4450 K and 3311 K. Based on the stellar characteristics and orbital dynamics, an estimated age of 2 billion years for the system is possible. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. =Orbit= Kepler-16b orbits around its parent stars with about 14% and 0.5% of the Sun's luminosity, respectively, every 228 days at a distance of 0.704 AU from its stars (nearly the same distance that Venus orbits from the Sun, which is about 0.71 AU). The Kepler-16b is unlikely to form at the current orbit, and likely migrated from elsewhere. Yet low eccentricity of its orbit remains unexplained. Potential habitability The habitable zone of the Kepler-16 system extends from approximately 55 to 106 million kilometers away from the binary system. Kepler-16b, with an orbit of about 104 million kilometers, lies near the outer edge of this habitable zone. Although the chances of life on the gas giant itself are remote, simulations conducted by researchers at the University of Texas suggest that sometime in the system's history, perturbations from other bodies could have caused an Earth-sized planet from the center of the habitable zone to migrate out of its orbit, allowing Kepler-16b to capture it as its moon. Furthermore, the researchers also considered the possibility of a faraway habitable planet orbiting at about 140 million kilometers away, which could retain the thermal energy needed to keep water liquid through a thick mixture of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide and methane. For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary and that of the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun- like star. In the case of Kepler-47c, this would be practically the same to have a stable orbit. Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain plate tectonics, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give the satellite a strong magnetic field. To support an Earth-like atmosphere for about 4.6 billion years (the age of the Earth), the moon would have to have a Mars-like density and at least a mass of 0.07 . One way to decrease loss from sputtering is for the moon to have a strong magnetic field that can deflect stellar wind and radiation belts. NASA's Galileo's measurements hints large moons can have magnetic fields; it found that Jupiter's moon Ganymede has its own magnetosphere, even though its mass is only 0.025 . Name In the announcement paper, the discovery team stated: \\"Following the convention of Ref. 22, we can denote the third body Kepler-16 (AB)-b, or simply \\"b\\" when there is no ambiguity.\\" It is listed as Kepler-16 (AB)-b on the SIMBAD Astronomical Database.Object query: Kepler-16b on the online SIMBAD Astronomical database The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia lists it as Kepler-16 (AB) b. The Smithsonian Center has informally referred to Kepler-16b as \\"Tatooine\\", a reference to the fictional planet orbiting two suns that is a key setting in the popular Star Wars series. \\"Again and again we see that the science is stranger and weirder than fiction\\" said John Knoll, the head visual effects supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic, who worked on several of the movies.

Jackson serves in the Maine Senate from District 1 (Senate District 35 prior to 2013https://www.pressherald.com/2013/05/31/bipartisan- panel-approves-maine-legislative-redistricting/), representing northern Aroostook County, including the towns of Fort Kent, Madawaska and Caribou. On December 5, 2018, Jackson was unanimously elected President of the Maine Senate. Jackson started in politics during the 1998 logging blockade along the Quebec border, protesting the illegal hiring of Canadian workers over Maine loggers, inadequate wages and poor working conditions. Eventually, Jackson was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, where he served three terms before being elected to the Maine Senate in 2008. After Democrats gained the majority in the 2018 election, Jackson was chosen to be Senate President. He has also serve as Senate Majority Leader, Senate Minority Leader and now Senate President. As Senate President, he is first in line to be Governor of Maine in the event of a vacancy. Career Jackson first ran for the Maine House of Representatives in 2000 for Maine House District 151, as a Republican, and lost to Marc E. Michaud, Democrat. He was elected to House 151 in 2002 as an Independent, defeating incumbent Marc E. Michaud, Democrat. in 2004, after Maine's post census legislative redistricting, Jackson won a resounding reelection for House District 1, against Paul Berube, 3,486 to 1,248 In 2008 Jackson ran and won Maine State Senate District 35. In December 2012, Jackson was elected Assistant Majority Leader of the State Senate after the Democrats took back control of the body. On July 10, 2013, Jackson was elected Majority Leader of the Maine Senate after the resignation of fellow Democrat Seth Goodall. On July 1, 2013, following incumbent Democratic Congressman Mike Michaud's decision to explore running for Governor of Maine, Jackson announced he would run for Maine's 2nd congressional district, which had been Michaud's seat since 2003. On June 10, 2014, Jackson lost the primary to fellow State Senator Emily Cain. On Jan. 25, 2015, Jackson was elected as a member of the Democratic National Committee.. In November 2016, Jackson was re-elected to the Senate and a week later he was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be the Senate Minority Leader. During the 2016 presidential election, Jackson was a prominent supporter of U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders' campaign and cast his superdelegate vote for him at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. He was chosen to introduce Sanders at a campaign rally before 8,000 supporters in Portland, Maine on July 6, 2015. During the 2020 presidential election, Jackson again supported Sanders, and again addressed a Portland rally for Sanders on September 1, 2019. Politics He is an advocate for health care and workers rights, especially for fellow loggers. In 2010, Jackson wrote a bill which would have \\"prohibited the Maine Department of Conservation from employing foreign laborers at state- owned logging sites\\". It passed both the House of Representatives and the State Senate before being vetoed by Governor Paul LePage. LePage questioned the bill's constitutionality while Jackson said that LePage was favoring large Canadian logging corporations over American workers.LePages comments on logging stir debate in The County Bangor Daily News, August 26, 2011 In June 2013, Jackson called LePage \\"obstructionist\\" and \\"delusional\\" regarding discussions about the 2013-2014 state budget. LePage responded by saying that Jackson \\"claims to be for the people but he‚Äôs the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline\\", as well as saying Jackson had a \\"black heart\\".

It is the first film in the Tomie film series, based on a manga of the same name by Junji Ito. Plot In Japan, the police investigating the murder of high school girl Tomie Kawakami (Miho Kanno). They learn that in the months following the crime, nine students and one teacher have either committed suicide or gone insane. The detective (Tomoro Taguchi) assigned to the case learns that three years prior another Tomie Kawakami was murdered in rural Gifu prefecture. Other slain Tomie Kawakami's are discovered stretching all the way back to the 1860s, right when Japan began to modernize. The detective tracks down one of Tomie's classmates called Tsukiko Izumisawa (Mami Nakamura), an art student who is being treated for amnesia. She has absolutely no memory of the three- month period around Tomie's death, and is starting to suspect the cause has a supernatural source. Meanwhile, Tsukiko's neighbor is rearing a peculiar baby- like creature. Over the span of a couple weeks, it grows into a beautiful teenaged girl with orange eyes responding to the name of Tomie Kawakami. Soon afterwards, Tomie begins seducing Tsukiko's boyfriend Yuuichi (Kouta Kusano). Meanwhile, Tsukiko enters her new neighbor's apartment to investigate. Upon discovering her friend's dead body, she is attacked by her landlord and passes out due to asphyxiation. She wakes up in her psychiatrist's office and encounters Tomie. Tomie starts emotionally taunting Tsukiko and tries feeding her live cockroaches. She then begins taking selfies next to her. Soon thereafter, Tsukiko's boyfriend murders Tomie. As they go bury Tomie's headless body in the woods, she comes back to life and Tsukiko runs off further into the woods and finds herself on a boat dock. Tomie then appears once again, now fully regenerated, and kisses Tsukiko on the lips. They both begin laughing as Tsukiko lights a flare and sets Tomie on fire. Tsukiko is now shown leading a normal life, still taking photographs and being interested in art. One day as she goes to develop a picture she took of herself, she notices a mole under her left eye she didn't have before; the same kind of mole Tomie had. Tsukiko then looks at herself in the mirror in shock as Tomie appears, smiling. Cast * Mami Nakamura ‚Äì Tsukiko Izumisawa * Miho Kanno ‚Äì Tomie Kawakami * Yoriko Douguchi ‚Äì Dr. Hosono * Tomorowo Taguchi ‚Äì Detective Harada * Kenji Mizuhashi ‚Äì Kenichi Yamamoto * Rumi ‚Äì Kaori Production Miho Kanno was chosen specifically by manga author Junji Ito for the role. Director Ataru Oikawa admired the original manga for Tomie, referring to it as a \\"fairy tale in bad taste\\". Opposed to a shocking and gorey film, Oikawa desired to make a film he described as not one \\"where people scream with fear. I didn't imagine that kind of horror movie. I wanted this to be more like a drama for youth.\\" As the comic contained graphic violence, Oikawa decided that he would work from a clean slate while still seeking seek manga author Junji Ito's approval and input. Oikawa's script draws characters and situations from the stories \\"Photograph\\" and Kiss\\" in Ito's original manga, although not \\"Mansion,\\" which also features Tsukiko as the protagonist. The film acts like a sequel to the manga taking place several years after the original story. For the role of Tomie, Miho Kanno was chosen specifically by manga author Junji Ito for the role. The film's score was composed by Hiroshi Futami and Toshihiro Kimura while the film contains a theme song from Japanese pop act World Famous. Release Tomie was released in Japan on October 6, 1998. It was released on DVD by Adness on February 3, 2004. Reception Video Watchdog reviewed Tomie, stating that it was \\"too mild and slow-going though it is attractively photographed and Ms. Kanno, with her soulless eyes and utterly creepy smile, remains the quintessential Tomie.\\" Aftermath and influence After the release of Tomie, the first sequel was not a theatrical film but a direct-to-video release of Tomie: Another Face released on October 25, 1999. The next theatrical Tomie film was Tomie: Replay that was released on the bottom half of a double bill with Uzumaki on February 11, 2000. In 2005, the film Tomie: Beginning was released as a prequel adapted faithfully from the original manga. Tomie: Beginning ends where Tomie begins.

The ruler of Golconda was the well entrenched Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. Aurangzeb and the Mughal army had successfully conquered two Muslim kingdoms: Nizamshahis of Ahmednagar and the Adilshahis of Bijapur. It was only a matter of time that the Mughal army arrived at Golconda Fort. The siege of Golconda lasted 8 months and on various occasions it had pushed the massive Mughal army to its limits, in fact the Golconda Fort was probably the most impregnable fort in the Indian subcontinent. Aurangzeb and the Mughals entered Golconda through a decisive victory. Command After the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and the Mughal army had successfully conquered two Muslim kingdoms: Nizamshahis of Ahmednagar and the Adilshahis of Bijapur; the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb then assembled the most advanced Mughal army to date and began his siege on Golconda Fort. Aurangzeb had assigned Mir Jumla and his army of 10,000 to lead any future assault on Golconda Fort. Ghaziuddin Khan Siddiqi Firuz Jang son of Khwaja Abid Siddiqi Kilich Khan and Father of Nizam I of Hyderabad Qamaruddin Khan Siddiqi was assigned to bombard the walls of the fort using almost a 100 Cannons including the very powerful and massive Rahban and Fateh Rahber (one of Aurangzeb's most favorite cannon). Another Mughal cannon is said to be the most impressive it is known as the Azhdaha-Paikar (Python Body) it had the ability to shoot Cannon balls weighing over 35 kg, this particular bronze cannon was cast in the year 1647. The Mughal admiral Munnawar Khan was assigned to deliver food and weapon supplies to the besieging Mughal army. The general Dilir Khan was assigned to command the Matchlock Sepoys that tried to penetrate the defenses of Golconda Fort. While Shaista Khan, Murshid Quli Khan and Ibrahim Khan commanded the rest of the army and its reserves around Golconda Fort and throughout all the Qutbshahi territory. The ruler of Golconda Fort, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah had strong walls reinforced with granite and a very powerful mortar called the Pata Burj. Siege Aurangzeb during the siege of Golconda, 1687 (Hyderabad, India) As the Qutbshahi ruler of Golconda, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah refused to surrender to the Mughals, he and his servicemen fortified themselves at Golconda Fort, and fiercely protected the Kollur Mine, which was then the world's only diamond mine at that time. His most experienced Golconda commander Muqarrab Khan defected to the Mughals. The Qutbshahis had constructed massive fortifications throughout successive generations on a granite hill over 400 ft high with an enormous 8 mile wall enclosing the city. The main gates of Golconda had the ability to repulse any War elephant attack, as they had iron spikes on the gates to damage the advancing Mughal elephants. In January 1687, the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb led his grand Mughal army against the Deccan Qutbshahi ruler taking refuge in Golconda Fort. Aurangzeb had surrounded Golconda Fort and alongside about 100 Cannons began siege operations. In order to breach the granite walls of Golconda Fort, Firuz Jang was appointed to utilize the massive Rahban, Fateh Rahber and the most impressive Cannon during the siege known as the Azhdaha- Paikar (Python Body) it had the ability to shoot Cannonballs weighing over 50 kg. In response to the Mughal bombardment Abul Hasan Qutb Shah fired from his powerful high-vicinity mortar called the Pata Burj, and according to Saqi Mustad Khan bamboo rockets were also utilized day and night against Mughal encampments. Meanwhile, due to heavy rains the Manjera River over-flooded and the scarcity of food supplies became a dire complication, this led to the death of many animals and caused malnourished troops to get ill. Fearing a possible counterattack organized from the fort, Aurangzeb ordered the construction of a fortified position made of wood and mud, which would house and organize Mughal attacking parties. The intense cannon fire from Golconda Fort against the approaching Mughals eventually caused the death of the experienced Mughal commander Kilich Khan Khwaja Abid Siddiqi and furthermore Aurangzeb was grieved by the death of his long time commander Gaziuddin Khan Siddiqi Bahadur Firuz Jang, who died of natural causes. Although the Qutbshahi's maintained impregnable efforts defending their walls, at night the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and his infantry of assembled and erected complex scaffolding that allowed them to scale the high walls. Aurangzeb also ordered his men to throw huqqa (grenades) while scaling the fortified wall and were reinforced by Matchlocks and Composite bows. While most of these attacks remained largely unsuccessful, they managed to demoralize the defenders of Golconda Fort. During the eight-month siege the Mughals faced many hardships like small-scale famines for weeks at a time, but whenever the Mughal Admiral Munnawar Khan arrived with supplies and weapons with his river fleet, Aurangzeb would intensify the siege. Although the Qutbshahi's maintained impregnable efforts defending their walls, the siege had become unbearable for the officials in service of the Qutbshahi's and finally Sarandaz Khan revealed a back door that led directly Golconda Fort, immediately after the Mughals stormed the fort, Sarandaz Khan opened the gates that allows the Aurangzeb's army to enter. The Mughal army led by Ghaziud-Din Khan Feroze Jung the son of the fallen Kilich Khan Khwaja Abid Siddiqi was among the first to enter the gates. He immediately charged towards the citadel of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, eventually taking him prisoner by surprise. Firuz Jang and his forces occupied Kollur Mine and the Mughal reserves, disarmed the defenders of the fort and paved their way for the entry of victorious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Golconda Fort was later repaired and armed with superior cannons. Shaista Khan is known to have spared the Qutbshahi servicemen, the ruler of Golconda, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, however, was imprisoned in Daulatabad Fort by the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Aftermath The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and his army managed to penetrate the walls by capturing a gate prompting the Qutbshahi's of Golconda and the ruler Abul Hasan Qutb Shah to surrender peacefully and hand over the Nur-Ul-Ain Diamond, Great Stone Diamond, Kara Diamond, Darya-e-Nur, The Hope Diamond, the Wittelsbach Diamond and The Regent Diamond making the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb the richest monarch in the world.

Origin The Excerpta Latina Barbari is a Latin translation of a Greek chronicle composed in Alexandria during the reign of Zeno (474-491) or Anastasius (491-518).Joh. Jos. Hoeveler, Die Excerpta Latini Barbari, Festschrift der dreiundvierzigsten Versammlung deutscher Philologen und Schulmanner, Bonn, 1895, pp. 193-214; Theodor Mommsen, Chronica Minora, p. 184(= Monumenta germaniae historica; Auctorum antiqyissimorum) tomus ix; Berlin, 1892, p. 272. The original Greek chronicle was a variation of the Chronica Alexandrina.Frick. Chronica minora. 1892. p. 330; f. 48b. cf. his introduction. p. lxxxvii ff. It was translated into Latin c. 750 by an anonymous Merovingian author. It was originally dated to the 7th century (MGH AA IX, p. 83, 249; Frick, Chronica [n.57], p.ccxi), but is now assigned to the mid-8th (Loew, CL.A V, no.560; Porcher, in Karl der Grosse, Dusseldorf, 1967. III p. 59f n. 19; Bischoff. Mittel-alterlichen Studien, Stuttgart, 1966, I p. 60). Excerpta Latina Barbari derives its name from the fact that the late Merovingian translator made many mistakes in translating the Greek into Latin. It is also now known that the translator included some alterations to the original chronicle.\\"Studies in Eusebian and post-Eusebian chronography\\", Richard W. Burgess, Witold Witakowski, Franz Steiner Verlag, 1999, p. 32. These alterations include the insertion of a lineage linking the Merovingian kings to the ancient Trojans (see Francus) as popularised in the Liber historiae Francorum. Joseph Justus Scaliger took the first scholarly interest in the chronicle in his Thesaurus temporum (1606) and first named the chronicle Barbarus Scaligeri. This subsequently became Excerpta Latina Barbari because of the translator's bad conversion of Greek into Latin. Some modern scholars have criticized this name, but it remains in use.'Menelaos' in the Spartan Agiad King-List, R. Ball, The Classical Quarterly, New Series, Vol. 27, No. 2, 1977, p. 316. The 8th-century manuscript of the Latin version of the text is now housed in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France . Contents The chronicle contains two main sections: (a) the history of the world from the creation to Cleopatra and (b) a list of kings or rulers from Assyria to the consuls of Rome (including the Ptolemaic dynasty, a list entitled \\"high priests and kings of the Jews\\" and an entry for Macedonian kings). The king's lists start by including some mythological kings, for example the entry for Assyrian rulers starts from Belus dated c. 2206 BC.The Assyrian King list in the Excerpta Latina Barbari claims Belus ruled 1430 years before the first Olympiad (776 BC) thus dating him to 2206 BC. Menelaus is also considered a historical king of Sparta.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in November 1996; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in November 1997. Plot In the prelude, taking place 3,000 years before Conan's time, a raiding army from the empire of Acheron descend on the city of Nithia, located near an oasis deep within the desert, inhabited by worshippers of the peaceful and benevolent god, Ibis. The warriors systematically massacre the entire population, their goal being to gain possession of the Grim Grey God - an extremely powerful and evil artifact with mystical properties, which the priests have guarded for many centuries (not to use it, but to prevent it from being used). The Acheronian general, having killed all the priests, holds up the artifact and gloats over his victory. Fortunately, a spell unleashed by the murdered Arch-Priest of Ibis drowns him, his soldiers, and the entire city in sand. Nithia remains buried under the desert for three thousand years, a fabled City of Brass whose location no one knows. Eventually, a gust of wind uncovers it. Soon, Nithia is rediscovered by a passing smuggler - and a map drawn by the smuggler falls into the hands of a pirate captain named Conan. To him, the statue of the Grim Grey God reputedly buried in Nithia's ruins represents treasure - he isn't initially aware of its dark powers. However, rivals also seek to plunder all of Nithia, including Jade, empress of the thieves' guild, Toj the assassin, and two necromancers (one of whom is Conan's recurring foe, Thoth-Amon) convinced that the statue will give them the power to restore their reign of darkness over the world, as in the days of ancient Acheron. The climax involves an ancient warrior restored to life and a world- wide threat which only Conan can overcome. Reception Reviewer Don D'Ammassa calls the book \\"a quite complex sword and sorcery adventure\\" and \\"quite enjoyable.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan and the Grim Grey God\\" (review on Critical Mass). Oct. 9, 2017. Relation to \\"The God in the Bowl\\" \\"The God in the Bowl\\", one of the original Howard stories, introduced the god Ibis.

In fact, this sender bore the opposite of love, the \\"gift\\" was a supernatural booby trap intended to kill the priest - but it was opened while on the way in Nemedia, caused the death of an innocent bystander, and was eventually disposed of by Conan's sword.

Though the symptoms defining movement disorders stem from neurological bases, the term has expanded to include a variety of conditions.movement disorders  Background  Neurological disorders such as, but not limited to, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, Huntington's disease, multiple system atrophy, and brain trauma and stroke are marked by numerous symptoms. Among the physical symptoms are rigidity, involuntary muscle contractions, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), dyskinesia (excessive and/or repetitive involuntary movement), and impaired balance. Non-motor symptoms can also impact movement. For example, the sense of proprioception can be affected, limiting the ability to orient where one's limbs are in relation to the space around the body. Other medical ailments can also restrict movement and affect muscle strength, flexibility and balance. Though not neurologically based, conditions such as aging, arthritis, fibromyalgia, lupus, and multiple sclerosis can benefit from yoga for movement disorders.  Benefits  Muscle spasms, atrophy, and rigidity associated with movement disorders often restrict balance and range of motion. Research shows that the benefits of yoga for movement disorders include improved strength, flexibility, balance, overall fitness and quality of life. A study by the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Society of India concluded that significant improvement resulted in each aspect measured in Parkinson's patients who participated in the yoga program of a set series of modified poses.Parkinson's Disease & Movement Disorder Society of India Iyengar Yogashraya, Light on Yoga Research Trust: http://www.parkinsonssocietyindia.com/Yoga_Parkinson_Disease.aspx At the University of Kansas, a study measured the benefits of a specifically designed yoga class on the gait, balance, and overall well-being of Parkinson's patients.Searles, Y. \\"The Therapeutic Effects of Yoga in Individuals with Parkinson's Disease.\\" University of Kansas: http://www.hourglassfitnessandwellness.com/documents/HGFYogaforParkinsons.pdf In a study conducted at the Indiana University, yoga poses particular to the needs of stroke patients showed improved recovery.Gerwig, A. et al. \\"Preliminary Evidence of Yoga on Balance and Endurance Outcomes for Veterans with Stroke.\\" Indiana University: http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/18772.html  Yoga for movement disorders  Limits to balance and range of motion restrict the ability of individuals with movement disorders from practicing traditional yoga poses in a way that is beneficial to them. Injury can result from overstretching. Anxiety, a common symptom of a number of movement disorders, can heighten from the physical challenges of trying to move into a pose. The stress from the fear of falling can overwhelm the meditative value from standard yoga practice. Yoga for movement disorders is marked by a practice that addresses the needs particular to people living with movement disorders. Adaptations to the flow of poses as well as the individual poses reduce risk of injury and anxiety. The use of supports and modifications enhance balance and range of motion, providing stability and alignment. Supports for assisting with balance and alignment in yoga for movement disorders include chairs, walls, bolsters, straps, weighted bags, blankets. In addition, techniques using verbal cues and musicAnderson, P. Music Improves Motor and Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's.

He was rumored to be an All-American honoree in 1922; however, the only known player named Gray to be awarded consensus All-American honors at Princeton in 1922 was Howdy Gray, who was also an end. Under the alias of Gray, the impostor played in the National Football League in 1923 for the St. Louis All-Stars and the Green Bay Packers. In 1923, the impostor approached Ollie Kraehe, the owner and player-coach of the NFL's St. Louis All-Stars. Kraehe signed him to the All-Stars where the impostor played in three games. After witnessing the poor quality of play in what he thought was Dolly Gray, an All-American football star at Princeton, Kraehe discovered that he was lied to and that the man claiming to be Dolly Gray was actually an impostor. Kraehe decided to pull the deception that had been pulled on him on another team. After a 6‚Äì0 loss to the Cleveland Indians, Kraehe released the impostor to Curly Lambeau and the Green Bay Packers in exchange for cash he desperately needed to keep his team operating. From Lambeau's perspective, it appeared that he had gained the best player on the All-Stars roster. Two weeks later, the Packers played the All-Stars at Sportsman's Park. The game ended in a 3‚Äì0 Packers victory. After the game, Curly Lambeau cornered the St. Louis owner and questioned him about Dolly Gray. According to Lambeau, Gray played in just one game with the Packers and had played poorly. Then, after boarding the train for the team's game in St. Louis, he had mysteriously disappeared. Kraehe then admitted to Lambeau that the deal between the two clubs regarding Gray was a joke. He explained how the con man had deceived his way onto the All-Stars roster. Kraehe then thought that he would try to recycle the trick on Lambeau in good fun. Kraehe finally stated that it had always been his intention to give Lambeau back the money he spent on the impostor.

Operations The Standarte first encompassed administrative control of Auschwitz personnel in 1943, after a territorial command change occurred from the authority of the General Government to that of the Gauleiter of Upper Silesia. Due to the practice of SS members holding in fact two separate SS ranks (one in the General-SS and the other in the Waffen-SS), the 23rd Standarte served as a \\"paperwork command\\" for personnel considered \\"cross assigned\\" between the General and Waffen-SS.

Early life Jarrett was born into a prosperous African-American family in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1927, when Jarrett was two years old, his father was killed in a gunfight over a woman. The family became poor, and at the age of seven Jarrett was sent to live with his grandparents on a farm outside Nashville. His step-grandfather had a violent temper and threatened him with a beating when he found he was writing song lyrics, reportedly saying \\"Only white boys write songs. Black boys don't write songs.\\" At 15, Jarrett rejoined his mother and worked his way through Pearl High School in Nashville. In 1944, during World War II, Jarrett was drafted into the military, just as he was about to attend Fisk University. He ultimately returned to Fisk in the 1970s, and graduated in 1974. Musical career In 1951, Jarrett became a disc jockey for WSOK in Nashville. He also did talent scouting for Tennessee Records. While performing at a white Nashville club called the Pink Elephant in 1955, Jarrett wrote \\"It's Love Baby (24 Hours a Day)\\", which became a No. 2 R&B; hit for Louis Brooks and His Hi-Toppers, although the vocals were actually by Earl Gaines, a friend of Jarrett's. The song, which also charted for Hank Ballard and Ruth Brown, launched Jarrett's songwriting career. Later in 1955, country singer Webb Pierce recorded Jarrett's \\"Love Love Love\\", which spent eight weeks at the top of the country/western music charts. In his autobiography, Jarrett tells of being stopped by a policeman outside Nashville's Hermitage Hotel because he didn't believe a black man would be invited to the 1955 BMI awards ceremony, where Jarrett was to receive an award for \\"Love Love Love\\". In 1957, Jarrett wrote and produced \\"You Can Make It If You Try\\" for Gene Allison, which was a No. 3 hit on the R&B; charts early in 1958 and also charted on the pop charts. The song has been covered many times since by artists such as the Rolling Stones, Buddy Guy, and Gene Vincent. Jarrett ran or worked for a number of Nashville soul, blues, and gospel labels, including Champion, Calvert, Cherokee, Poncello, and T-Jaye. He produced for artists such as Christine Kittrell, The Fairfield Four, Larry Birdsong, Roscoe Shelton, and The Avons. Recognition In 2004, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum released a compilation album entitled Night Train to Nashville, containing many tracks produced by Jarrett; it was produced to go with an exhibit of the same name at the museum. A tribute concert was held at the museum in 2005 to coincide with the publication of Jarrett's autobiography You Can Make It If You Try. Death Jarrett died of liver failure in his hometown of Nashville on March 21, 2009, aged 83.

The cortistatins were first discovered in a search for naturally occurring compounds that inhibit proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), with cortistatin A being the most potent compound in the class. The Shair group at Harvard along with collaborators have shown that cortistatin A is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of CDK8 and CDK19, the kinases that associate with Mediator complex. Out of 386 kinases evaluated, cortistatin A only inhibited CDK8 and CDK19, revealing that it is among the most selective kinase inhibitors. It was also shown that cortistatin A potently inhibits growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells and AML in two in vivo mouse models. Identification of dominant drug-resistant alleles of CDK8 and CDK19 demonstrate that these kinases mediate the activity of cortistatin A in AML cells. Thus, inhibition of CDK8 and CDK19 is a new therapeutic approach to AML. Cortistatin A caused selective and disproportionate up-regulation of super-enhancer-associated genes in AML cells which contributed to its anti- leukemic activity. This work indicated that CDK8 and CDK19 are negative regulators of super-enhancer-associated genes in AML. Di-dehydrocortistatin A suppresses viral replication in cells infected with HIV via binding to the Tat protein. Cortistatin A was synthesized by the Shair, Myers, Baran and Nicolaou labs.

Han poetry as a style of poetry resulted in significant poems which are still preserved today, and which have their origin associated with the Han dynasty era of China, 206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD, including the Wang Mang interregnum (9‚Äì23 AD). The final years at the end of the Han era (known by the name Jian'an, 196‚Äì220) often receive special handling for purposes of literary analysis because, among other things, the poetry and culture of this period is less than typical of the Han period, and has important characteristics of its own, or it shares literary aspects with the subsequent Three Kingdoms period. This poetry reflects one of the poetry world's more important flowerings, as well as being a special period in Classical Chinese poetry, particularly in regard to the development of the quasipoetic fu;Davis, xlvi the activities of the Music Bureau in connection with the collection of popular ballads and the resultant development of what would eventually become known as the yuefu, or as the rhapsodic formal style;Birrell, 5‚Äì13 and, finally, towards the end of the Han Dynasty, the development of a new style of shi poetry,Watson, 7 as the later development of the yuehfu into regular, fixed-line length forms makes it difficult to distinguish in form from the shi form of poetic verse, and at what point specific poems are classified as one or the other is somewhat arbitrary. Another important poetic contribution from the Han era is the compilation of the Chuci anthology, which contains some of the oldest and most important poetic verses to be preserved from ancient China, as well as the transmission of the Shijing anthology.

Darkest blue are the principalities and commandaries of the Han Empire. 2. Light blue is the Tarim Basin protectorate. 3\\\\. Sky blue areas are under fluctuating control. 4. Crenelations are the Great Wall of China during the Han Dynasty. The ruling dynastic family of the Han dynasty was the Liu family, founded by Liu Bang, whose career ranged from being a minor official (sort of like a local sheriff during the rapid disintegration and chaos of the final years of the Qin dynasty) to being an outlaw and a rebel hiding out in the hills, to being the King of Chu during the Division of Qin into 18 states, or kingdoms. He was posthumously honored as Han High Founder or Han Great Ancestor (Gaozu) Emperor. Despite his folksy background, general lack of literacy, and what were considered generally vulgar ways, Liu Bang had a great regard for literature and learning. His patronage of literature and the arts, as well as his connections with the unique culture of Chu would set a precedent for the rest of the dynasty which he founded, and which managed to keep much of the political power in the hands of the Liu family: often this was implemented by allowing Liu family princes a great deal of autonomy in their local areas, thus encouraging the development of subsidiary royal courts, besides the main imperial court; and, in some cases, this encouraged princely patronage of literature and the arts, with some greater diversity and cross-fertilization of artistic genres and styles. Other important features of the Han era include the location of the capital in Chang'an during Western Han, and its move to Luoyang in Eastern Han, the extension of the Han empire into new regions, and contact with new peoples and cultures, a development which was extended by the further explorations by people such as Zhang Qian of the Silk Roads fame who in the 2nd century BC got as far as Bactria and Dayuan (Ferghana, in modern eastern Uzbekistan), and among other things brought back alfalfa and grapes to China. Also important in the history of the Han dynasty is the method of recording words, such as poems. Brushing characters with ink is archeologically attested to during the Han period, including on silk, hemp paper, and bamboo slips. The bamboo (or wood) slips were tied together carefully with delicate string cords. When these rotted and broke, the individual slips would become mixed up, and the text which was written upon them thus have often become scrambled. Methods such as stamping or marking on clay or engraving on stone were also used; and, though relatively durable required fairly elaborate craftsmanship to produce. Little poetry from the Han dynasty survives as originally recorded or published, instead most of the preserved poems exist as passed on to the future by the Six Dynasties poetry era anthologies. Poetic background An important part of the poetic legacy received by Han dynasty poets was the Shijing verse style, typified by its \\"classic\\" four-character line verse. The influences of the Shijing verses during the Han era were directed towards important aspects of Classical Chinese poetry, such as use of the direct voice of immediate experience which was intended to provide a window into expressing a person's soul.Hinton, 8 Another important legacy received by the Han poets was that of the Chu Ci genre of poetry with innovations in some of its verse forms, such as varied line lengths, a body of material which was expanded by further additions by Han poets, and then published in an edited anthology. Furthermore, there was a received tradition of orally transmitted folk songs and folk ballads. The imperial court of the preceding primitive Qin dynasty was not known for its poetry: the primitive Qin, instead, preferred the primitive activity known as the burning of books and burying of scholars (Chinese: ÁÑöÊõ∏ÂùëÂÑí; pinyin: f√©nsh≈´ kƒìngr√∫) and, in the end, the \\"fires of Qin\\" extended to the destruction of its imperial library. There was little or no direct poetic influence from that source. The extension of the Han empire into new areas introduced new and exotic concepts and material objects, which sometimes became the topics of works in the fu prose-poetry literary form. Also, during the Han dynasty, state policies in regard to the philosophical dialog associated with Confucius focused a certain amount of public attention and public funding supporting the Shijing (Classic of Poetry), which from then on was regarded as one of the few members of the select list of canonical classic works. Han dynasty poets Some well-known poets from Han times are known; however, many of the poets are anonymous, including the poets behind the Music Bureau collections including the Nineteen Old Songs, as is typical of verses from the folk ballad tradition. Important individual Han era authors of poetry include Zhang Heng and Liu Xiang. Many of the Han poets who wrote in their own personal voice under their own name or pen-name wrote in the fu style, in the sao (Chuci) style, or both. In other cases, poems have been attributed to specific Han dynasty persons, or written in perspective of their persona, but the real author remains unknown. For example, the cases of the poems attributed to Su Wu and Consort Ban are not determined. Other Han poets include Sima Xiangru, Ban Gu, and Mi Heng. =Sima Xiangru= Sima Xiangru (179‚Äì127 BC, also known as Szu-ma Hsiang-ju) was one of the most important poets of the Han dynastic era, writing in both the Chuci and the fu styles. =Su Wu= Su Wu in foreign captivity, where he was forced to herd sheep or goats. From the Long Corridor. Su Wu (140 ‚Äì 60 BC) was held captive for 19 years, returning to China in 81 BC: 4 poems collected in the Wen Xuan are only questionably attributed to him.Davis, vi However, at the time, it was not uncustomary to confuse the persona of a poem with the person of the author. There is a story about Su Wu which became a common allusion in Chinese poetry. According to this story, during the beginning of his captivity in the Xiongnu empire Su Wu was treated harshly, to the point it is said of having to eat the lining of his coat for food and to drink snow which he melted for water. Later Su was elevated in status, even it is said given a wife who bore him children. Upon the Han emperor sending an ambassadorial mission toward the territory in which he was being held, the Xiongnu ruler (the chanyu) wished to conceal the presence of Su Wu, presumably in order avoid diplomatic complications; but, Su Wu hearing of this tricked the chanyu by claiming that he had sent a message to the emperor by tying it to the leg of a goose, and accordingly, that since his presence was already known to the Chinese delegation that any attempts at concealing his presence would be viewed as unseemly. This is at least part of the origin of the use of the image of a flying goose as a messenger, carrying tied to its foot (perhaps symbolically) a letter between two people separated so far seasonally north and south that a migrating goose could be conceived as a possible mode of communication. =Ban Jieyu (Lady Pan)= Ban Jieyu also known as Lady Pan (Pan Chieh-Y√º) was a concubine to Emperor Cheng of Han (reigned 33‚Äì7 BC) and the great-aunt of the poet, historian, and author Ban Gu. A well-known poem in the Wen Xuan is attributed to her. Although most unlikely to actually be by her (especially since it is not in her grand-nephew Ban's biography of her),Davis, vi it is certainly written as if it could have been written by her or someone in her position. It is an important early example of the secluded palace lady genre of poetry. =Ban Gu= Ban Gu was a 1st-century Chinese historian and poet best known for his part in compiling the historical compendium the Book of Han. Ban Gu also wrote a number of fu, which are anthologized in the Wen Xuan. Chuci One of the most important Han era contributions to poetry is the compilation of the Chuci anthology of poetry, which preserves many poems attributed to Qu Yuan and Song Yu from the Warring States period (ended 221 BC), though about half of the poems seem to have been in fact composed during the Han Dynasty.Hawkes, 28. The meaning of Chuci is something like \\"The Material of Chu\\", referring to the ancient Land of Chu. The traditional version of the Chu Ci contains 17 major sections, anthologized with its current contents by Wang Yi, a 2nd-century AD librarian who served under Emperor Shun of Han, who appended his own verses derivative of the Chuci or \\"sao\\" style at the end of the collection, under the title of Nine Longings. The poems and pieces of the Chu Ci anthology vary in their formal poetic styles, including varying line metrics, varying use of exclamatory particles, the use or not of titles for individual pieces within a section, and the varying presence of the luan (or, envoi). Other Han period poets besides Wang Yi the librarian who are known or thought to be contributors of poems collected in the Chuci include the poet Wang Bao and the scholar Liu Xiang. Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, and his literary circle were involved with the Chuci material, but the attribution of authorship of any particular poems is uncertain. Fu Liangyuan Gathering: Song dynasty painting of a Han dynasty literary gathering in the Liang Garden of Liu Wu, Prince of Liang. Liang was one of the principalities of the Han empire, and an area (like its Prince Liu Wu) associated with great literary attainment. One of the major forms of literature during the Han dynasty was the fu (sometimes translated as \\"rhapsody\\"), a kind of eclectic grab bag of prose and verse, not easy to classify in English as being either poetry or prose. In Chinese, the fu is classified as wen rather than shi, however these terms do not correspond to English categories of prose and verse (one of the differences in the traditional Chinese categorization being that shi was sung or chanted, whereas the fu was not, at least according to the Hanshu), the credibility of this being enhanced by the fact that one of the compilers of the Hanshu (also known as Book of Han or History of the Former Han Dynasty) was Ban Gu, who was himself a practitioner of the fu style.Davis, xlvi The Han fu derived from the Chuci,Davis, xlviii which was traditionally considered to be the work of Qu Yuan, who was a wanderer through the countryside and villages of the Kingdom of Chu, after his exile from court. In this context the \\"Li Sao\\" is particularly relevant. The Han fu of the second and first centuries BCE were intimately associated with the courts of the emperor and his princes.Davis, xlviii In other words, they were refined literary products, ornate, polished, and with an elite vocabulary; and, often the subject matter includes topics such as life in the palaces of the Han capital cities. The development of the fu form of literature during the Han dynasty shows a movement toward later more personal poetry and the poems of reclusion, typical for example, of Tao Yuanming, the Six Dynasties poet.Davis, xlix The famous Han dynasty astronomer, mathematician, inventor, geographer, cartographer, artist, poet, statesman, and literary scholar Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139 CE) wrote a fu about his own, personal experience (real or imagined) of getting out of the city and its politics and getting back to the country and nature.Davis, xlix‚Äìxl The fu form continued to be popular in the centuries following the demise of the Han imperial power. Oral tradition folk ballads An important aspect of Han poetry involves the influence of the folk ballad tradition, which can be seen in the poetry collections Nineteen Old Poems and the yuefu of the Music Bureau. =Nineteen Old Poems of Han= One of the stylistically most important developments of Han poetry can be found in the Nineteen Old Poems collection. Although extant versions exist only in later collections, particularly the Wen Xuan literary compendium, the 19 poems themselves appear to be from the Han period. They are influential both toward the gushi (\\"old style\\") poetic form, but also for their \\"tone of brooding melancholy....Anonymous voices speaking to us from a shadowy past, they sound a note of sadness that is to dominate the poetry of the centuries that follow.\\"Watson, 30‚Äì32 Many versions of these 19 poems thus continued to be reinvented in post-Han times, including a major revival in Tang poetry times. As Nineteen Old Poems literally means \\"19 gushi, poetry written in inspiration by this style were referred to as being in the gushi style, or simply labeled gushi (also transcribed as ku-shi, in English). =Music Bureau (Yuefu)= Another important aspect of Han poetry involved the institution known as the Music Bureau, or, in Chinese, Yuefu (or, Y√ºeh-fu). This is contrast with the \\"literary yuefu\\", which are written in the general style of Music Bureau's collection of yuefu, or derived from particular pieces thereof. The Music Bureau was a Chinese governmental institution existing to historical and archeological evidence at various times during the history of China, including an incarnation during the Qin dynasty. The Han dynasty largely adopted the Qin institutions for their own organizational model, and in particular Han Wudi is associated with a revival or an elevation in the status of the Music Bureau, which he relied upon for the elaborately spectacular ceremonial performances conducted under his regime. The traditional functions of the Music Bureau included collecting music and poetry lyrics from around the empire, and conducting and choreographing their performance for the emperor and his court. Poetry verses published by the Music Bureau are known as \\"Music Bureau\\" pieces, later works modeled on the style of the Music Bureau pieces are known as \\"Music Bureau style\\" pieces (yuefu); and, some of these \\"literary yuefu\\" and \\"new yuefu\\" poems were written by some of the best of the subsequent poets. The Han era Music Bureau (yuefu) pieces were collected and transmitted to future times in such (mostly Six Dynasties era) anthologies as the Wen Xuan and the New Songs from the Jade Terrace. Jian'an poetry and the future of Yuefu Picture of later calligraphy of a poem attributed to Cao Bin, younger brother of Cao Zhen. The final regnal era of Han was called Jian'an. At this period the political structure of Han was breaking down, while new developments in poetry were arising. This Jian'an yuefu poetry style continued on into the Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties era, as did the lives of some of the authors of poetry such as Cao Cao, who was born during the Han dynasty but survived it. The Han Music Bureau style which developed out of the models of the Music Bureau poetry was a particularly important feature of Jian'an poetry and the subsequent Six Dynasties poetry: the evolutionary trajectory of this poetry was towards the regular, fixed-length line verse which reached such acclaim in its Tang realization. Poetry preserved from the Han dynastic era not only exists as a monument to the achievement and skill of the poets of that time, but also serves as a link in a poetic legacy that was explicitly valued during the Tang dynastic era (during which the poems developed in the tradition of this style were known to critics as (\\"new yuefu\\"), and continued to be valued in subsequent Classical Chinese poetry, and on to the poetry of today; which is in turn, another link in a long chain of development in the field of poetry, to which the poets known and anonymous made their unique contributions.

Preventive conservation protocols protect the lifespan of cultural objects while allowing them to be viewed safely. Collections care, which is sometimes called preventive conservation, involves any actions taken to prevent or delay the deterioration of cultural heritage. The primary goal is to identify and reduce potential hazards to heritage with thoughtful control of their surroundings. The professions most influenced by collections care include conservator-restorers, curators, collection managers, and registrars. Definition Cultural heritage face threats from a variety of sources on a daily basis, from thieves, vandals, and pests; to pollution, humidity, and temperature; to natural emergencies and physical forces; to all kinds of light. Effects stemming from these issues can be treated and sometimes reversed with interventive conservation after the damage has occurred. However, many of the sources of danger mentioned above are controllable, and others are at least predictable. Collections care strives to mitigate the occurrence of damage and deterioration through research and the implementation of procedures which enhance the safety of cultural heritage objects and collections. The areas of particular concern with regard to the sources of damage include: environmental conditions, collections maintenance, museum integrated pest management, emergency response, and collections management. Environmental conditions Environmental conditions are highly controllable in most indoor situations. They include the temperature, relative humidity, light levels present in a collection space on any given day, and contaminants. Some flexibility is naturally built into most collections when it comes to the temperature and humidity changes they can bear, allowing for conditions to vary somewhat in response to the outdoor environment of a location. Two types of light offer potential decay to cultural heritage: ultraviolet (UV) light and visual light (light that can be perceived by the human eye). Although they can be affected simultaneously by removing light sources, reducing overall intensity, or increasing the distance between a light source and an object, best preventive practice treats these types of light separately due to their differences. Contaminants can come in many forms including naturally occurring chemical breakdowns in certain compounds, particulate pollutants, and accidental human contamination. Protecting collections from contaminants can be as simple as creating barriers to prevent abuse or as complicated as taking preventive actions to protect an object from its own chemical breakdown. Psychrometers are one instrument of choice to measure the temperature and relative humidity of a space. =Temperature= Any storage or display situation must take into consideration the temperature at which collection permanence can be optimized, and systems should be in place that aim to meet that standard, ideally in conjunction with efficient use of energy and funds. Different materials react to temperature in different ways. For example, ceramics are vulnerable to direct heat on a mechanical level, but many organic materials are at greater risk of undergoing phase transition if the temperature becomes excessively cold. One rule of thumb applies across the board: the rate of chemical reactions is dependent upon temperature in such a way that higher temperatures reduce the activation energy and hasten chemical degradation processes. Human comfort levels must also be considered. Storage areas can often get away with slightly lower temperatures than display areas since they are not accessed as often, and it is most likely that those who do enter the space will be prepared for the conditions. In galleries, however, viewers must feel comfortable enough with the temperature to spend time there, otherwise the collection will simply not be viewed and lose its purpose in being on display. =Relative humidity= In recent decades, it has become understood that even delicate organic materials have some elasticity in their response to relative humidity (RH) fluctuations, allowing the materials to swell or contract as necessary. This phenomenon is naturally reversible within a range of 50% ¬± 15% RH. Destructive chemical and mechanical processes, such as hydrolysis at high RH and embrittlement and cross-linking at low RH, can be held to a minimum within a similar range for a general museum collection. Moisture has strong effects on nearly all cultural heritage materials, with ceramics and glass being exceptions to these effects in most cases. Metals face the risk of corrosion as RH increases, a risk which is enhanced by surface contaminants and emphasizes the need for proper housing. Additionally, mold growth is far more likely as humidity increases, which not only could cause allergic reactions for viewers but it also weakens the collections afflicted and attracts other pests. In contrast to this requisite for dry conditions, if the atmosphere is not humid enough wooden objects could crack or warp, and many organic materials face embrittlement below 40% RH. Although minor and gentle fluctuations in RH can reasonably be withstood by most collections, quick or drastic shifts can be harmful. Anistropic materials such as wood and ivory are especially responsive to humidity changes, and RH issues are compounded when they are attached to inorganic materials such as a metal. The metal acts as a restraint, hindering the organic materials‚Äô ability to expand and contract as needed. Thus, cultural heritage objects composed of highly responsive materials or a combination of organic and inorganic materials should ideally be in carefully controlled climates and buffered against the atmosphere by their display or storage housing. =Visible light= Visual light, measured in lux or foot-candles (fc), cannot be eliminated, as it is required both to view collections in detail and to move safely in the presence of collections. Unfortunately, this means that harmful oxidation effects which visual light makes possible also cannot be eliminated, but merely reduced to the amount necessary for the task at hand. The effects of visual light began to be studied by artists and color manufacturers as early as the 18th century, but it was not until the mid-20th century that the chemical damage caused by different lighting situations was researched in depth. In recent decades the cumulative nature of light degradation has become better understood by conservation science. Comprehensive studies began to emphasize long-term effects and allow for short-term variation in light levels depending on the specific situation: standard viewing, viewing by the aged, complex study or treatment, and observation of low contrast details all may have different requirements. Practical compromise between protection of cultural heritage and allowing the artifacts to fulfill their visual purpose means there is an allowance of some physical risk. Even with this flexibility, light interaction should be limited to moments when an object is on view or undergoing study, and the level of lighting should be chosen accordingly. According to Museum Registration Methods, 5th edition, the suggested light levels for certain types of objects is as follows: ::\\"The traditional recommended light level for sensitive materials‚Äîincluding textiles, botanical and zoological specimens, pigmented objects, works on paper, and organic materials such as feathers, furs, and skins‚Äîis no more than 50 lux or 5 fc. Moderately sensitive materials, such as oils and acrylics on board and composite inorganic objects, should be exposed to light levels of not more than 150 lux or 15 fc. The traditional levels recommended for the least light-sensitive materials, such as stone, ceramics, metals, and glass, are not more than 300 lux or 30fc.\\" Because lighting effects are cumulative, any limit in exposure ‚Äì whether in time or in intensity ‚Äì prevents material degradation. A period of intense or lengthy light exposure should be balanced out with periods of low exposure. =Ultraviolet= UV is a form of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light. It does not contribute to the accurate viewing of collections and is ideally completely eliminated; otherwise materials may be weakened in any number of ways ranging from yellowing to disintegration. Organic materials, especially textiles and paper, are particularly vulnerable to UV-caused decay. Direct sunlight holds the most potential for UV damage, but certain types of artificial light bulbs may also produce these harmful rays. Various types of filters have been developed to combat UV interaction with artifacts on display, and many of them can be used in conjunction with each other to reach the optimal setting for a particular collection. Among the first employed were heavy drapes; a simple solution to apply only if an institution can provide employees to open and close the drapes at the appropriate times based on viewer access. Many filtration devices rely on materials that absorb the UV, such as acrylic films or painted wash walls, but in doing this the materials themselves decay and the filters must be replaced. A better solution is interference filters, which can be customized for the setting of intended use to reflect light at such an angle that it cancels out harmful incoming wavelengths. If an interference filter is selected as the appropriate form of filtration, UV is eliminated completely and efficiently. =Contaminants= Contaminants in a collection can pose a threat not only to the objects within the collection, but also to those individuals that come in contact with them. It is therefore necessary to ensure that all objects brought into a collection are carefully documented and researched to prevent accidental contaminations, and to create storage conditions, such as those mentioned above, to mitigate the potential for future contaminate development. Potential contaminants can take the form of gases, liquids, or solids and may therefore pollute objects, and the individuals caring for them, through airborne delivery or physical contact. Collections affected by contaminants will show signs of disintegration, discoloration, or corrosion, with porous materials being the most susceptible. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) are some of the most common types of gaseous pollutants found within collections and can result in the catalyzation of deleterious chemical reactions. The chemical reactions caused by these gases can result in the breakdown of inorganic and organic materials, or the tarnishing of metal objects. Other objects contain intrinsic elements that may begin to break down over time causing a damaging condition known as off-gassing. The storage of construction materials and basic housekeeping within a collection area may also be a source of gaseous pollutants. The hazardous fumes given off by strong cleaning products such as bleach or ammonia can transfer to objects causing deterioration, and construction materials such as adhesives, paints, and sealants may off-gas resulting in additional damages. Particulate contaminants, including pollen, dust, fibers, and soot, may affix to objects after entering collection areas through poorly maintained ventilation systems. Individuals passing through a collection area may also have particulates embedded on their clothing or bodies, which can become dislodged thereby becoming an airborne contaminant. Construction or maintenance efforts are another common cause of particulate pollution. Particulates which adhere to collection objects may cause soiling or blemishing, requiring mechanical removal and conservation efforts. These pollutants can be minimized via high quality HVAC systems, regularly replaced filters for vents, and careful placement of objects away from high-risk areas such as designated smoking sections, construction sites, and high-traffic areas such as entryways. Human interaction with objects poses a threat of accidental contamination. Moisture and oils from human skin can cause staining of organic materials and corrosion of metals. This risk can be mitigated through implemented handling protocols such as washing hands and wearing protective gloves to minimize direct contact. Objects may also be enclosed in protective casing to further reduce direct handling when possible. Proper storage techniques, such as the use of neutral tissue or untreated cotton packed in polyethylene sheeting or acid- free corrugated cardboard, may be used to individually wrap pieces to prevent accidental contamination of objects between handling and display. Storage and display cases should be carefully evaluated for off-gassing risks, and following storage procedures such as those outlined above will all reduce the risk of contaminant damage to objects. Object handling Every time an object is handled, it is at risk for damage. Although high standards for general housing and for packing help eliminate direct handling and decrease chances of damage due to contact, some routine activities such as cataloging and housekeeping will often require work with collection objects. To prevent accidental damage it is important to establish guidelines for handling to be followed by all individuals in a position to come in contact with the collection. Prior to touching an object, individuals should wash their hands and determine the most appropriate handling procedures based on the medium being handled. Metal, paper, textiles, and other porouse materials require the use of cotton gloves to prevent oils from human skin tarnishing, staining, or otherwise damaging the object. Glass, glazed ceramics, and other potentially slippery surfaces should be handled using latex or vinyl gloves to prevent slippage. Prior to handling an object, it is also important to (1) take note of any structural weaknesses so that direct pressure on these areas may be avoided, (2) any clothing or accoutrements with the potential to scratch or catch on the object should be secured, and (3) the object's weight should be considered so that additional help may be requested when handling heavier objects. It is important to examine the types of materials to be used while handling the collection. If collection objects are to be moved, the use of flatbeds, carts, dollies, or pallet lifters may be warranted, with these objects being dubbed structurally sound prior to use. Tote pans or support trays are sometimes used for smaller objects, and liners such as polyethylene foam pads, quilted furniture pads, and acid-free tissue are commonly used as an added layer of protection. When necessary, handlers may also don lab coats, safety glasses, dust masks, or respirators. =Display and storage housing= Oddy tests undergo accelerated aging in small sealed jars that are placed in an oven set at 60 degrees Celsius for four weeks. Other than smart structural design, one of the major components of display and storage housing is proper selection of materials and collaboration with a mount maker in the creation of suitable display and storage mounts. Especially for long-term solutions, the materials that surround an object must not interfere negatively with the materials that compose the object. Experimentation using Oddy tests is a qualitative way to determine whether specific materials undergo deleterious chemical reactions in the presence of one another. Environmental conditions as explained above are also crucial to housing decisions. =Packing and transport= An archival tube to roll a Chinese scroll for storage. Proper packing techniques and materials are the best way to achieve object safety during transit, and ‚Äì as with nearly every aspect of preventive conservation ‚Äì these must be determined in response to the particular objects involved. An ideal shipping container not only provides a shell of protection from shock, vibration, and mishandling, it also helps insulate the interior climate from fluctuating atmospheric conditions and defend against pests. Packing mounts, protective wrapping and cushioning, packing materials, crate size and layers, and means of transport are all variables which an object handler must work into an effective strategy for safe shipment. Successful moves of the past suggest that the shipment of objects begin with a complete inventory and condition survey of the objects prior to their movement. If a large number of objects are to undergo the transition, it is recommended that a smaller, representative group be sent first to reveal any improvements that can be made for the bulk of objects. All objects should be assessed to determine whether they need stabilization before shipment; it is possible that some should not travel at all due to their condition. Often journeys require several means of transport and transitions from one shipping company to another; therefore, investigation must be done to determine the least reliable portion of the trip, and packing details should revolve around that. Many collection departments contribute to successful object movements. Conservators, registrars, collection managers, photographers, and curators should all be involved and help contribute to clear planning and communication throughout the process. Multiple institutions are usually involved as well. The destination of the shipment must be evaluated so that the objects can be prepared adequately for transitions, including considerations for acclimatization and unpacking. = Dissociation = Dissociation is considered by the Canadian Conservation Institute as the tenth agent of deterioration. Dissociation is the result of the human error in the system. Integrated pest management Silverfish are a common problem in museum collections. They feed on sugars and starches such as glue, plaster, paper, photos, cotton, linen, and silk. Pests pose a serious threat to cultural heritage. Whether they feed off of the composition materials or seek shelter within a collection, they can cause damage through actively dismantling or consuming objects, staining or dirtying them, weakening structures, or simply by attracting other harmful creatures. Pests that frequent collections can be grouped into four main categories: stored product and fabric feeders that feed on dry, organic materials; wood destroying insects; general feeders that may damage a variety of material types; and nuisances and health hazards, which may not be as harmful to collections, but are otherwise considered undesirable or risks to human health. Commonly encountered pests from within these categories include insects, microorganisms, and rodents, but in certain locations birds, bats, lizards, and mollusks must be considered a threat as well. The approach to preventing pest infestation has changed quite a bit in the methodology employed. Where formerly fumigants and pesticides were applied directly to every collection, now more passive and less toxic means of pest management are favored. These newer techniques, termed integrated pest management (IPM), can be just as effective with careful and thorough planning. Different object materials are sensitive to different infestations, so a thorough material understanding of the artifacts to be protected and the pests resident to the area is required. Risks involving the collection building, constructive and decorative materials, and staff activities should be assessed, and a program should then be put in place which reduces these risks. The primary goal of IPM is to prevent pest infestations through careful planning. The simplest way to prevent pests from entering areas of concern is to keep the space uncluttered and sanitary. Additionally, holes or cracks in the building construction should be filled if possible, and deteriorating areas should be repaired or monitored carefully for breaches. All objects brought into the collection should be isolated for a time until it can be confirmed that no pests have traveled with the object. Regular inspections for signs of infestation should take place, and these should be well-documented to track any changes in problem areas and the effectiveness of the system in place. Careful monitoring of environmental conditions within the building, such as those outlined above, can also be implemented to deter pests from entering the facility or discourage them from flourishing should they gain access. If an infestation does occur, the response must consider the safety of the cultural material involved. Individual objects can be quarantined through bagging to either contain or prevent infestation. Effective treatments include fumigation, freezing, or pesticides; cost may be the major deciding factor, based on the infestation and the institution. Emergency precautions and response Every type of disaster‚Äîfrom fires to floods to earthquakes to civil disorder‚Äîfalls into the category of emergency when it comes to cultural heritage. These cannot be controlled, of course; however, they can be predicted to a certain extent based on the location of the collecting institution, and the readiness of the institution for extreme situations can be controlled. Many times if a catastrophe strikes, collections cannot be returned to their previous condition, and large numbers of objects face this risk at once, making the development of an effective risk management plan essential. Well-designed display mounts and storage housing, regulated storage space, and rehearsed drill procedures all contribute to effectively mitigating the risks associated with emergencies. Because of the interdisciplinary support such endeavors require, an additional benefit is that separate departments gain a better understanding of each other's roles and how they overlap. Collections management The management of a cultural heritage object serves to identify the staff members responsible for care and maintenance of the collection, and establish proper management technique guidelines. Records management should take place when an object enters a collection, when it is moved or shipped, during regular collection inventories, and throughout any conservation treatment as per established collection management policy standards. Records management of a cultural heritage object often takes place in the form of photographic documentation combined with written reports designed to provide a visual reference for future professionals, revealing the original condition and any successive states of the condition. These records are sometimes digitized and stored in computer databases using collection cataloging software. One aspect of records management designed specifically for sustaining these digitized records and documenting digital collection materials is known as digital preservation. This technique is used to reformat or duplicate an original object so as to preserve a piece of digital material for as long as possible. Combining strategic planning with conservation actions, digital preservation aims to maintain continued access to digital objects that would otherwise become obsolete. Through proper records management, the success or failure of object treatments and housing can be determined and valuable lessons can be applied to future decisions. Most importantly, if anything should happen to the object, whether through disaster or natural decay, a record of its presence and purpose will still remain.

Jian'an poetry, or Chien'an poetry (Âª∫ÂÆâÈ¢®È™®), refers to those styles of poetry particularly associated with the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Six Dynasties era of China. This poetry category is particularly important because, in the case of the Jian'an poetic developments, there is a special difficulty in matching the chronology of changes in poetry with the usual Chinese dynastic chronology based on the political leadership of the times. For example, according to Burton Watson, the first major poet of the new shi style that emerged at this time was Cao Zhi, one of the sons of Cao Cao,Watson, 19 a family which came into power at the end of Han and developed further during the Three Kingdoms era of the Six Dynasties period. Time period The term Jian'an poetry covers the final years at the end of the Han Dynasty and during which the Cao family was rising, or risen, to prominence were known as the Jian'an era (196-220), the final reign era of Emperor Xian of Han: the following period is known as the Three Kingdoms era, due to the three kingdoms which divided up the Han Dynasty, and war with one another for succession to the Han empire. A prominent Han dynasty general, Cao Cao effectively took control of the Han dynasty from the Liu imperial family, and following Cao Cao's death, his son Cao Pi formalized this by accepting the abdication of the last titular ruler of Han and establishing the Cao family as the ruling dynastic family of a new state, Wei (also known as Cao Wei), one of the Three Kingdoms which were successor states to the Han empire. Besides their role as leaders in war and politics, the Cao family also had an important role in the field of poetry and literature. Three Caos Cao Cao and his sons Cao Pi and Cao Zhi are collectively known as the \\"Three Caos\\" of poetry. Along with several other poets, such as Xu Gan and the other Seven Scholars of Jian'an, their poems form the backbone of the jian'an style. Seven Scholars of Jian'an \\"The Seven Scholars of Jian'an\\" was a name which Cao Pi came up with in an essay to describe seven major literati of the Jian'an era. Among them were Kong Rong (153‚Äì208), who was later executed by Cao Cao, along with his family: only a few of his poems survive. Wang Can (177‚Äì217), a poet known for his \\"Poem of Seven Sorrows\\" (‰∏ÉÂìÄËØó), a five- character poem which lamented how much the people suffered during the war years. Another is Chen Lin. Han poetry background The poetry of the Han Dynasty was in part characterized by the fu, sometimes referred to as a \\"rhapsody\\", which was a form of literature that in English could be considered either a form of poetry, a form of prose, or something in between. The typical Han fu is typically very long, describes a subject minutely from every possible angle, giving long and detailed lists of various categories of things and is usually meant more to display the poet's rhetorical and lexical skill than to express personal feeling. Another important aspect of Han poetry was the institution of the Music Bureau, a government organization originally charged with collecting or writing the lyrics. The Chinese name for the Music Bureau was yuefu; however, note that the use of fu in yuefu is different from the other Chinese term fu, which refers to a different type of poetry or literature using a different character. The developments in both of these forms of poetry in the Han Dynasty help in the understanding of the work of the Jian'an poets. Developments Jian'an poetry shows significant developments away from the detailed catalogs of the fu and toward the yuefu form of poetry; at the same time, the Jian'an poets developed the yuefu into a different form with a different voice, a form which was a direct predecessor to the major form of shi poetry later embraced by the Tang Dynasty poets. In the major developments in terms of poetic voice, whereas Han poetry tended to use an anonymous voice which was either impersonal or in the mode of certain shallow and conventionalized characters, the Jian'an poetry tended to be more personal and immediately direct.

The result is that the cell or mitochondrion expends energy to generate a proton motive force, but the proton motive force is dissipated before the ATP synthase can recapture this energy and use it to make ATP. Uncouplers are capable of transporting protons through mitochondrial and lipid membranes. Description Classical uncouplers have five properties: # the complete release of respiratory control # the substitution of all coupled processes (ATP synthesis, transhydrogenation, reverse electron flow, active transport of cations, etc.) by a cyclic proton transport mediated by the uncoupler # the elimination of all protonic and cationic gradients generated across the mitochondrial or prokaryotic membrane # no discrimination in these actions between one coupling site and another # no discrimination between coupled processes driven by electron transfer and coupled processes driven by ATP hydrolysis Pseudo-uncouplers show one or more of these properties, but not all, and thus must be combined with one or more other pseudo-uncouplers to achieve full uncoupling.

History Epoch premiered at the San Diego Comic-Con International Convention in 2011. It is a five issue comic book mini series written by Kevin McCarthy, with art by Paolo Pantalena.McCarthy, Kevin (2011) Epoch Top Cow Procductions, Inc. Plot While investigating the murder of his partner Michael, NYPD Detective Jonah Wright discovers not only his supernatural heritage but also a conspiracy that threatens to tear the fabric of our society. To expose the killer, Jonah must compete in EPOCH, an ancient fighting tournament that will determine the future of humanity. =Epoch #1= NYPD Detective Jonah Wright and his partner Michael have been working a series of violent murders. Their only witness, Congresswoman Mya Tokage, agrees to give them a name - Wilfred Glendon - and an address with the promise of immunity. Upon arriving, however, Jonah and Michael find the suspect killed in the same manner as the other victims. The killer, still in the room, transforms into a blazing demon and takes down an entire SWAT team before punching a hole through Jonah's chest. Michael, who reveals himself to be an angel, gives chase. In the ensuing angel vs. demon battle, the demon leads Michael to a masked figure, who cuts off Michael's wings with a sword and kills him. Jonah, on the other hand, makes a miraculous recovery. Though placed on medical leave, he refuses to let the case rest. He recognizes the wounds on Michael's back as the same scars on his estranged father Gabriel. Jonah follows Gabriel to Chinatown, where he makes a startling discovery: Gabriel is part of a council of supernatural and mythological creatures. =Epoch #2= Tobias Atrox, leader of the Angel Order, convinces the council to grant Jonah and Gabriel jurisdiction to search for Michael's killer. Jonah confronts Gabriel, who explains it all. Centuries ago, the Supernaturals, outnumbered by humans, decided to band together and form a council to ensure a peaceful co-existence. Their council head was chosen by EPOCH, a single combat tournament. Michael, an archangel, had been their leader until now. Gabriel, also an archangel himself, was groomed to succeed Michael as warrior of the Angel Order, but decided to cut off his own wings and became a mortal when he fell in love with a mortal woman - Jonah's mother. Meanwhile, Tobias tries to persuade his wife, Aliyah, to train Jonah into a warrior to compete in EPOCH. Aliyah reluctantly agrees. Following a lead in Wilfred Glendon's murder, Jonah and Gabriel go to the club run by the vampire Cyrus. Jonah helps Cyrus take care of Griffin, the troublesome warlock warrior. Cyrus denies having anything to do with the murders, but tells Jonah to \\"follow the blood.\\" Jonah and Gabriel take a sample of Glendon's blood for toxicology, unaware that Michael's killers are watching them. =Epoch #3= Jonah wakes up in his apartment and contemplates the past. There is a knock at the door. It is Tobias and Aliyah. Tobias tries to convince Jonah to represent the Angels in Epoch, and tells him that Aliyah will aid in his training. Jonah doesn't answer either way yet. At work, Jonah interrogates a hobo who saw Michael's murder. Jonah learns that they are looking for a demon that burns blue. That night, Jonah accepts Aliyah's help, and she flies them to a dormant volcano to begin training. After a rough start, Jonah learns quickly. Later, Jonah meets up with Gabriel at the Museum of Natural History to see Delphin (a troll) to follow up on their neurotoxin lead. Delphin says he'll have the results in a few days. Outside, Aliyah meets them. Gabriel sees that she is attracted to Jonah, and warns her about the magnetism of the human spirit. She decides to continue training Jonah anyway, and puts him through the fire test, where Jonah must set his arm on fire but ignore the pain. Jonah and Aliyah go to Teotihuacan to watch the first round of Epoch: Rafael, the vampire vs Damien, the demon. Damien wins, and Jonah recognizes beyond a doubt that Damien is the one who killed Michael. =Epoch #4= Jonah heads to Stonehenge for his first round in Epoch. He fights and defeats Griffin, the warlock he was previously in a bar fight with. After the match, Delphin tells the Angels that the neurotoxin sample is definitely gorgon venom. They decide that it must have either been Mya Tokage or Nyx, and that if they can get one of their venom samples, they would be able to match it. Jonah is fighting Nyx in the next round, but in order to get her venom, he would have to be bit which would paralyze him. Later, Aliyah puts Jonah through a test to make him sprout his wings, but he fails. In the next round of Epoch, Damien defeats Grim, the troll champion. Jonah, despite being bit, manages to defeat Nyx at the Angor Wat Temple Complex. Jonah wakes up in his apartment with Gabriel waiting for him. Gabriel tells Jonah he is about to meet with Delphin to see if the venoms match. On his way out, Gabriel is intercepted by Mya Tokage. Aliyah comes to Jonah's apartment, they make love. Meanwhile, in the car Mya tells Gabriel that she was a part of the murder, and that Damien was indeed the one who killed Michael. She says that he wouldn't believe who their accomplice was even if she told him, so she's going to show him. Damien kills her when they arrive at the Cloisters Museum, and the hooded figure from the beginning kills Gabriel. =Epoch #5= Jonah finds out about his father's murder, and resolves to kill Damien. Jonah fights Damien in plain sight. Damien defeats Jonah, but doesn't kill him because he wants to do it in Epoch so it will be official. Jonah meets up with Aliyah to tell her he has no chance against Damien, and is dropping out of Epoch. At Michael's funeral, Tobias gives Jonah an uplifting speech about faith, which combined with Jonah's awareness that the supernatural council is falling apart without the right leader, forces him to stay in Epoch. The final battle takes place in the Colosseum, between Jonah and Damien. Damien kills Jonah, but through his death Jonah is reborn with the full powers of an Archangel, wings and all. Jonah is forced to kill Damien before he can find out who Damien was working with. Jonah appoints Tobias as head of the council rather than himself, and resumes work as a cop in both worlds. At the very end, the reader is shown that it was Tobias who was working with Damien all along. Species in Epoch These are the various supernatural races that have appeared in Epoch. They are called \\"Supernaturals\\" in the series. =Angels= Winged celestial beings originating from Heaven. There were once millions of angels, until a bloody civil war left the world with only one hundred. Dedicated to the protection of humanity, they became society's first responders and guardians (doctors, policemen, firemen, etc.). Angels are immortal, possess superhuman strength and speed, and are highly resistant to injury and extreme heat. Their wings allow them to fly with ease and they can retract their wings into their bodies in order to pass as human. Angels can be killed if their wings are first cut off, making them weak and-essentially-human. Most angels are peaceful creatures, however, the archangels are perfect warriors with superior abilities compared to other angels. They prefer the fighting styles of Jeet Kune Do and Aikido. Angels can mate with humans. =Demons= Eons ago, they fought the Great War against the angels, and were banned from Heaven. Rife with lust and desire, demons excel as lawyers, athletes, stockbrokers, ad execs, or any other high-stakes lifestyle that gets the adrenaline pumping, very much like vampires. Demons are immortal, possess superhuman strength and agility, are resistant to injury as well as immune to harm from extreme heat, and can set themselves on fire with no ill affects using a flammable chemical that secretes from their body when they use their powers, and each burn their own color. They can manipulate their personal fires to use as projectiles, protection from opponents, and other offensive weapons. They prefer to fight using Jiu Jitsu. =Vampires= Dark and mysterious undead beings who drink human blood to survive, their nocturnal nature make them perfect for the nightlife scene. Vampires are immortal, super-strong, super-fast, telepathic, and very agile. Their senses are razor-sharp. They prefer the Capoeira style of fighting. Their claws aid in fighting. =Werewolves= Werewolves are the supernatural world's version of organized crime. They run the docks, construction zones, waste management, taxi alliances, shipping, and other mafia-associated businesses. They rely on intimidation and brute strength to accomplish most of their goals. They depend on their superior strength and agility to out muscle and overwhelm an opponent in battle, and prefer the fighting styles of Muay Thai boxing and Krav Maga. Their bite transforms humans into werewolves. =Trolls= Born of the Earth, and a race of all males, nobody knows how the trolls were created. They are short tempered and reclusive, but renowned for their wisdom and intelligence. They are ideal museum curators, inventors, librarians, and scientists who live long, quiet lives of solitude often dedicated to a single pursuit. Due to their tough, leathery skin, trolls have the best defensive abilities, but are very slow. They prefer using a combination of heavyweight boxing and old school pro wrestling. They can change into human form and are super-strong. =Warlocks= Warlocks are only different from humans in that their supernatural DNA enables them to control the elemental energy of their surrounding environment (levitate, cast lightning, hurl projectiles, teleport, etc.). Today, warlocks blend in with high society as captains of industry. They prefer the fighting style of Kung Fu. =Gorgons= All descendants of Medusa, gorgons are a vicious race of all-female serpentines who have sharp fangs, snake-like tongues, impenetrable scaly skin, and dragon-like tails. They have the ability to shape-shift, making them perfect politicians, strategists, or anything else that duplicity is an asset. In battle, gorgons are not very strong on defense against supernatural opponents, but have superior regenerative abilities that make them very resilient and virtually immortal. Their bite is highly venomous. Ninjutsu is their main fighting style. =Banshees= Banshees are a mesmerizingly beautiful all-female race of fairy-like beings. They have retractable, razor-sharp, and needle-thin fingernails, and can also levitate. They're found in society as models, singers, entertainers, and assassins. Their fighting style is karate. Cast of Characters *Jonah Wright: The son of the Archangel Gabriel and an NYPD detective. A Nephilim and the last of the Archangel line. He began investigating Michael's murder, during which time he becomes aware of the existence of the supernatural. He was assigned to fight in Epoch to take service as Michael's successor. He was trained by Tobias' wife, Aliyah, who becomes sexually attracted to him despite his Humanity.

Retrieved 27 Jan 2013. History The Native Art Center offers studio art courses, workshops with Native Alaskan artists and cultural carriers, and artists-in-residence programs. Visiting artists are from Native Alaskan cultures, such as Yupik (including Alutiiq), I√±upiaq, Athabascan, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and Aleut artists from throughout Alaska. First founded in 1965, the Native Art Center brings together artists from rural communities to study indigenous forms of art at the University of Alaska (now known as UAF). Over the past 40 years, the center has evolved to become an academic-based program including courses in studio art and Native art history and special workshops and symposia on topics including mask making, bentwood traditions, basketry, sculpture and carving. Dedicated to the creative spirit and an objective to provide educational opportunities for young Native artists. Directors Ronald Senungetuk founded the Native Arts Center in 1965 and served as its director until his retirement in 1986. He was also head of the UAF Art Department from 1977 until retiring. He has been a teacher, mentor, and supporter of talented Alaska Native students who might not have otherwise had the aspiration or opportunity to attend college. During his UAF tenure, he advocated to keep the center active for both established and emerging Native artists who did not necessarily meet the typical university enrollment requirements. In 1987 artist, educator, and interim director of the Native Art Center Glen Simpson made the Native Arts Center part of the academic system in the Art Department, making it possible for students to receive a BFA in Native Arts. This was a time of flux for the Native Art Center with a number of interim directors, one being James Schoppert, a Tlingit artist. During his life, Schoppert became one of the most prodigious and influential Alaska Native artists of the twentieth century. His work includes carving, painting, poetry and essays. He has been described as an innovator, that made traditional and contemporary Alaska Native works often pushing the boundaries of what was considered \\"traditional\\" Northwest Coast art. Throughout his career he was a spokesman for Alaska Native artists and artists in general. Harry Calkins was an interim instructor from until 1991. In 1992 Alvin Amason, a Sugpiaq Alaskan painter and sculptor, took over as director of the Native Art Center until his retirement in 2006. It was under Amason's directorship in 2003 the Native Art Center started offering Master of Fine Arts degrees in Native Arts, the only institution in the Alaska to do so.

Festugiere, A.-J., Vie de Theodore de Sykeon, t. I, Bruxelles: Societe des Bollandistes, p. V. in the early 7th century. His hagiography, written after 641, is a key primary source for the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641). His feast day is April 22. Life =Early life= Theodore was born in Sykeon, a village in Galatia. The public highway of the imperial post ran through this village, and on the road stood an inn kept by a very beautiful girl, Mary, her mother, Elpidia, and a sister Despoinia. And these women lived in the inn and followed the profession of courtesans. Theodore was the son of Mary and Cosmas, who had become popular in the Hippodrome in the corps of those who performed acrobatic feats on camels and was appointed to carry out the Emperor's orders.Three Byzantine Saints: Contemporary Biographies of St. Daniel the Stylite, St. Theodore of Sykeon and St. John the Almsgiver, (trans. Elizabeth Dawes), (London: 1948) When he was about twelve years old an epidemic of bubonic plague fell upon the village and it attacked him along with others so that he came near to dying. They took him to the shrine of St. John the Baptist near the village and laid him at the entrance to the sanctuary; he recovered and returned home. He used to frequent a shrine dedicated to the martyr St. George, located up the rocky hill which lay near the village. At the age of fourteen, he went there to live. Even at such a young age, Theodore was granted the gift of healing.\\"St Theodore the Sykeote the Bishop of Anastasiopolis\\", Orthodox Church in America Theodore then withdrew into complete solitude, to a cave not far from the oratory of St George. He persuaded a deacon to bring him bread and water, and he told no one else where he had hidden himself. =Bishop= For two years St Theodore lived in this seclusion until news of the youth‚Äôs exploits reached the local bishop Theodosius, who ordained him to the diaconate, and later to the holy priesthood, although the saint was only seventeen years old at the time. He was chosen Bishop of Anastasioupolis.\\"Our Holy Father Theodore the Sykeote\\", Serbian Orthodox Church During the reign of Emperor Maurice (r. 582‚Äì602), he foretold the emperor's death and \\"great tribulations, terrible scourges [that] threaten the world.\\" He was soon proven correct with the outbreak of the 26-year-long Persian war sparked by the death of Maurice. He was a close friend of the family of Emperor Phocas. Despite that, he spoke of Furthermore, he would only pray for Phocas if the latter stopped massacring people. Still, after the successful rebellion of Emperor Heraclius, he intervened to save the life of Domentziolus, the nephew of Phocas. In return, St. Theodore of Sykeon was asked to \\"pray for [Heraclius] and his reign.\\" St. Theodore of Sykeon had good relations with Patriarch Sergius of Constantinople. Still, historian Walter Kaegi says that Heraclius \\"may always have felt some reserve in his relations with\\" St. Theodore. During Lent 613, Heraclius asked for St. Theodore's blessing in fighting the Persians. St. Theodore blessed him and invited him to dinner, but Heraclius refused because of time concerns. However, the saint claimed that not accepting his gifts was a \\"sign of our defeat\\". Indeed, Heraclius lost the Battle of Antioch. He died on April 22, 613. =Veneration= His remains were quickly brought to Constantinople to protect them from the Persian war and to add divine protection to the city. An elaborate ceremony of the reception of the remains associated St. Theodore with Heraclius's regime.

Previously Kovaleski worked at NBC Bay Area, KNTV in the San Francisco Bay Area. From 2001 to 2011, he was the investigative reporter at KMGH-TV in Denver, Colorado. Early life Kovaleski was born in Iron River, Michigan and graduated from San Jose State University. Professional career Kovaleski joined the NBC Bay Area Investigative team in December, 2011. His most recent work includes exposing problems at sporting venues throughout California. His investigations into Santa Clara County's VTA Light Rail system have exposed abnormally high fair evasion rates. His second report showed that after two years, the light rail system was still unable to provide credit card readers for its riders. In addition, his reporting on mechanical breakdowns of a major East Bay school bus provider alerted several East Bay school districts to a history of unreported problems. In the summer of 2008, while at KMGH-TV in Denver, Kovaleski aired a series of stories that chronicled problems with emergency ambulance service in Denver including response times that were nearly double the national standard. The stories also showed there was no permanently stationed ambulance at Denver International Airport even though the facility was more than twenty miles from the city center. In December 2008, more than 100 people were on Continental Airlines Flight 1404 when the pilot lost control. The plane slid off Runway 34 Right and burst into flames during take-off. Kovaleski obtained records of the ambulance response showing the first emergency ambulance needed 33 minutes to reach the scene. The investigative documentary \\"33 Minutes to 34 Right\\" aired in March, 2009 and lead to significant changes in Denver's ambulance procedures and policies including the permanent assignment of an ambulance at DIA. In May 2010, Kovaleski reported on several state-appointed board members of Pinnacol Assurance accepting gifts and an all- expense-paid trip to Pebble Beach. The board was tasked with oversight of Pinnacol Assurance including the agency's spending. Kovaleski's investigation forced an overhaul of the board including the appointment of a new president and the implementation of strict regulations on travel and gifts accepted by board members. Kovaleski‚Äôs source based investigative reporting landed interviews with four members of Denver‚Äôs FBI that produced a look inside the federal investigation and conviction of admitted terrorist Najibullah Zazi. The 30-minute documentary provided insight into how the Denver‚Äôs FBI office unraveled a national terror plot targeting New York City. Awards In his two decades working as a reporter Kovaleski has been honored with more than four dozen national and local awards including the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Award in 2010, the 2011 National Emmy Award for Investigative Reporting, the National Edward R. Murrow Award for Investigative Reporting the Sigma Delta Chi Award and the National Headliner Award. His 25 Emmy Awards include recognition for writing, investigative reporting, live reporting and journalistic enterprise. In 2004 and 2006, the Colorado Broadcasters Association named Kovaleski the state‚Äôs ‚ÄúBest Specialty Reporter.‚Äù He has been honored several times by the Associated Press and the Radio Television Digital News Association. In 1997, the Texas Associated Press named Kovaleski that state's \\"Reporter of the Year.\\" In December 2011, Kovaleski and his colleagues John Ferrugia and Theresa Marchetta were recognized by Denver's 5280 Magazine as one of the 50 Most Powerful People in Colorado. The Call7 Investigative Team ranked 27th Most Powerful in the state of Colorado, according to the magazine.

He and his younger brother Hans Andreas Djurhuus, also a poet, are called the √Åarstova brothers after the house where they grew up. Life and work Djurhuus's parents were √ìla J√°kup Djurhuus (1832-1909) and Else Marie n√©e Poulsen, from H√≥sv√≠k (1847-1897). He was a great-grandson of Jens Christian Djurhuus. Djurhuus said that his \\"poetic baptism\\" came in school, when he heard J√°kup Dahl (later a provost and Bible translator and author of the first school grammar of the Faroese language) declaim J√≥annes Patursson's N√∫ er tann stundin komin til handa (Now is the hour come for acting), the anthem of the Christmas Meeting of 1888 which began the rise of Faroese nationalism.John Frederick West, Faroe: The Emergence of a Nation, London: Hurst, 1972, , p. 235. Djurhuus trained as a lawyer. After passing the preliminary examinations in 1897, he went to Denmark for university preparation, first in Copenhagen and then in Bornholm. He passed the qualifying examinations in 1900, graduated with the cand. jur. degree in 1911, and then practised in Copenhagen until the late 1930s, when he returned to the Faroes to practise there. However, he kept in touch with his homeland through students. His first published poem was \\"Bl√≠√∞ er summarn√°tt √° F√∏roya landi\\", in 1901. In 1914 he published Yrkingar (Poems), the first collection of a single poet's work published in Faroese.Sven H. Rossel, tr. Anne C. Ulmer, A History of Scandinavian Literature, 1870-1930, Nordic series 5, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 1982, , p. 222.Martin N√¶s, F√¶r√∏sk Litteratur: Udvikling og Vilk√•r, Studier fra Danmarks Biblioteksskole 42, Copenhagen: Danmarks Biblioteksskole, 1981, , p. 16 He published four further collections of poems. Djurhuus had also studied classical philology, and also published accomplished Faroese translations of Ancient Greek and Latin works, including some of Plato's Dialogues and poetry by Sappho, and (posthumously) a poetic translation of the Iliad. (He also published translations of poetic works by Goethe, Dante, Heinrich Heine and Gustaf Fr√∂ding).West, p. 236. There is a story that on one occasion when a Greek steamer called at T√≥rshavn, he went on board and sent a cabin boy for the captain. On his arrival, he began to recite the Odyssey in Ancient Greek. The astonished captain joined in. His poetry combines Classical and Norse mythology.W. Glyn Jones, \\"Faroese Literature\\", Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature, ed. Virpi Zuck, Niels Ingwersen and Harald S. Naess, New York: Greenwood, 1990, , pp. 159-61, p. 159. The language of his poems draws on both modern Faroese and the language of the traditional ballads, as well as ancient and modern poetry in other Scandinavian languages; their rhythm is also influenced by ancient Greek and modern German poetry.West, pp. 235-36. Literary reputation Djurhuus's poetry represented the breakthrough into modern literature in Faroese.Ernst Krenn, Die Entwicklung der foeroyischen Literatur, Illinois studies in languages and literature, Urbana: University of Illinois, 1940, , p. 125 His poetry has been judged \\"among the best\\" of modern Scandinavian writing,Saga Book 13 (1949) p. 268. \\"splendid . . . of great vision and musicality\\" and some consider him the greatest Faroese poet, \\"the first Faroese writer of genius\\", \\"without a doubt a great poet\\".Scripta Islandica 45-49 (1995) p. 58 He was a national romantic,\\"essentially a late Romantic poet\\", Robert Nedoma and Nina von Zimmermann, eds., Einheit und Vielfalt der nordischen Literatur(en): Festschrift f√ºr Sven Hakon Rossel zum 60. Geburtstag, Wiener Studien zur Skandinavistik 8, Vienna: Edition Praesens, 2003, , p. 88. but his works show what has been described as poetic idealisation and love of his homeland conflicting with \\"something of a revulsion from [its] reality\\" and as \\"doubt and pessimism, a result of the clash between [his] powerful, pathetic dream of beauty and petty, miserable reality\\". \\"√ötlegd\\" (Exile--referring to his many years in Denmark) is an example of this pessimism.

Buck Naked Buck Naked is the Barenaked Ladies' first indie demo tape release, and featured only the original duo of Steven Page and Ed Robertson. The first known tape was released in 1988 (though most were released in 1989). There are four known editions of this tape, each with different track listings. The earliest version, dating from \\"Fall 1988\\", features five songs. Its cover is different from later versions: It is green with the faces of Page and Robertson pasted onto photos of Terence Trent D'Arby. This edition of the tape is very rare. The second, third and fourth editions feature a white cover with a black-and- white photo of Page and Robertson. The second edition has thirteen songs including a five-second outro track called \\"How's The Level?\\" The third and fourth editions added one and two additional songs respectively, with a reprise of \\"Road Runner\\" removed from the fourth edition. In all, somewhere between 150‚Äì600 copies of Buck Naked were made. It was recorded on a four- track recorder. The tapes were given to friends, and sold by the band off the stage. The different editions feature songs which the band would eventually re-record for later releases. \\"Be My Yoko Ono\\" and \\"If I Had $1000000\\" would appear on The Yellow Tape and their first album Gordon (both eventually becoming hits). Also recorded for Gordon (as the so-called \\"naked track\\") was \\"The King Of Bedside Manor\\". \\"The Great Provider\\" would be recorded again for the band's second label album, Maybe You Should Drive, and the Bucknaked recording would appear on the \\"Jane\\" CD single in 1994. \\"Night Photographs\\" would be recorded for The Pink Tape and that recording, with the pitch corrected, would appear on The Ladies Room, Vol. 1 fan club CD single in 1997. \\"Trouble With Tracy\\" was performed live, with a live recording appearing as the B-side to the \\"Brian Wilson\\" single in 1993. \\"Road Runner\\" would be performed live as well, with a live version appearing on The Ladies Room, Vol. 7 fan club CD single in 2003. The tape is credited for first getting the Barenaked Ladies noticed by college radio stations. Comedian-author Se√°n Cullen said the band gave him a tape at a Corky and the Juice Pigs show. Cullen recalled that he \\"listened to the tape and [...] quite liked it,\\" with his favorite track being the band's cover version of Terence Trent D'Arby's \\"Wishing Well\\". Cullen subsequently invited the Barenaked Ladies to be the Juice Pigs' opening act for some local and regional college shows. =Track listing, green edition= The second side of the tape includes most of the songs from The Police 1980 album Zenyatta Mondatta. =Track listing, final black & white edition= Barenaked Lunch (The Pink Tape) Barenaked Lunch (often referred to as The Pink Tape) is the Barenaked Ladies second indie tape release. The title is a pun on the novel Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs. This was the first tape recorded with bassist Jim Creeggan and percussionist Andy Creeggan, whose additions expanded the Barenaked Ladies to a quartet. The tape was recorded as a demo tape in 1990 and is also known as the Pink Tape. About 2,000 tapes were produced but were mastered incorrectly, with the songs playing too fast. Mitch Potter of Toronto Star wrote that Barenaked Lunch, along with the band's first tape Buck Naked, \\"overflow with boyish charm, brisk wit and clean, melodic harmonies worthy in and of themselves.\\" Potter added that, \\"'(You Can) Be My Yoko Ono' and 'If I Had $1000000', riddled with barbed one-liners, leave you in quiet reflection after the laughing stops, while 'Blame It On Me' indicates the songwriting duo is capable of losing the smirk without losing focus.\\" Potter called \\"Be My Yoko Ono\\" a \\"weepy love ballad\\" whose satire contains \\"nary a trace of the malice John [Lennon]'s widow draws from virtually every direction,\\" and described \\"If I Had $1000000\\" as a \\"warmly comic comeuppance on the quest for the almighty buck that has the pair trading drop-dead one-liners at the end of each plaintive refrain.\\" A December 1991 Toronto Star article remarked that twelve months earlier, Barenaked Ladies \\"were virtual unknowns. Today, they're one of Canada's most popular acts. Think how far they would have gone with songs like 'Be My Yoko Ono' if this indie cassette EP had been a real album, with big-money marketing behind it.\\" =Track listing= Barenaked Recess Barenaked Recess is the Barenaked Ladies' third indie tape. Unlike the others, however, this tape was never released for unknown reasons. Allegedly less than six copies were made. A rumour among fans alleges that Ed Robertson kept the tapes under his bed, although it was never proven nor debunked. A copy of the tape was leaked to the internet in March 2010 by an unknown source. The torrent containing the tape contains \\"Blame it on Me\\", which is identical to the recording from Barenaked Lunch (a.k.a. The Pink Tape). This, along with owners of the original tape claiming it is not on their copy, reveals that \\"Blame it on Me\\" was probably added in on a second generation copy.

It was originally recorded as a demo for the band's performance at South by Southwest. The Yellow Tape sold more than 85,000 copies and became the first independent release be certified platinum in Canada. Although officially self-titled, it is commonly referred to as The Yellow Tape, due to its yellow cover. It was re-released by Cheree Records in CD and vinyl record formats as Barenaked Ladies in the United Kingdom. The UK release dropped the track \\"Fight the Power\\". Early copies of the tape include an error in the J-card notes: drummer Tyler Stewart's name is misspelled as \\"Steward.\\" It also includes a different address for the band's management.

He is known only from a brief reference in Herodotus and his date is much disputed. Herodotus mentions Amphicrates in passing to explain why the people of Aegina enslaved a group of Samian exiles around 525 BC. He says that they did this because they remembered that King Amphicrates of Samos had led an attack on Aegina in which he \\"did the Aeginetans great harm and suffered great harm in turn.\\"Herodotus, Histories 3.59. There have been three proposals for the context of this event. * The first was proposed by J. P. Barron and followed by Graham Shipley. They link the event with the Lelantine War waged between the Euboean cities of Chalcis and Eretria around 700 BC, in which Samos is meant to have supported the Chalcideans.Barron (1964); Shipley (1987) 37-39 It is not clear why this would lead to an invasion of Aegina. The date and even existence of the Lelantine War has been questioned in recent scholarship. * T. J. Figueira and Aideen Carty proposed that Amphicrates' invasion of Aegina was connected to a conflict in which the Aeginetans attempted to win independence from Epidaurus, with the help of Periander of Corinth. Epidaurus was Samos' mother city and Amphicrates might have led an invasion in order to support the Epidaurians. This event would have taken place a little before 600 BC.Figueira (1983) 17 & 22, with Herodotus Histories 3.52; Carty (2005) 26-7. Carty suggests that it explains an episode recorded without context in Herodotus, in which the Samians seized a convoy of slaves sent by Periander to King Alyattes of Lydia.Herodotus Histories 3.48 * G. Schmidt and Robert Drews propose the Amphicrates ruled in mid-sixth century BC, as the immediate predecessor of Polycrates of Samos.Schmidt (1974), 185; Drews (1983) 28 This proposal has found little support, because it does not seem possible to fit Amphicrates into what is known about the chronology of Samos in this period from other sources. At some point, the Samian kingship was overthrown and replaced with an oligarchy ruled by a group called the Geomoroi ('land-sharers'). The date of Amphicrates is important, because he must pre-date this event. J. P. Barron and G. Shipley suggest that the Geomoroi overthrew the Samian in response to Amphicrates' failure on Aegina; but another source, Plutarch, says that the king that they overthrew was called Demoteles (perhaps Amphicrates' successor).Plutarch, Greek Questions 57  References  Bibliography   Category:Ancient Greek rulers Category:Ancient Samians Category:7th-century BC Greek people Category:6th- century BC Greek people ","title":"Amphicrates"},{"id":"33098362","text":"Kenneth Garay is currently an ESPN Sportscaster and was the lead host of the ESPN Deportes Radio show named ESPN al Despertar (Waking up with ESPN).

Named Potsdam Wildpark until 1999, it serves the Sanssouci Park and is famous for the Kaiserbahnhof building. History The Kaiserbahnhof and the rail hub in 1990 The Wildpark station was built in 1868 on the new line linking Berlin to Magdeburg. At the beginning of the 20th century, after the opening of the bypass lines to Nauen (1902) and J√ºterbog (1904), it was built a small rail hub. In 1909 the Kaiserbahnof (see the section below) was inaugurated for the private use of Kaiser Wilhelm II. From 1950, after the division of Germany, the station functioned in the Berlin outer ring (Berliner Au√üenring), and for some years was served by a holiday express train from Saxony to the Baltic Sea. After the completion of the Golm-Potsdam PirschheideNamed in that period Potsdam Hauptbahnhof bypass of the Au√üerring, the station remained part of a short lineRail transport map of East Berlin and neighbourhoods in 1988 to Potsdam Hauptbahnhof (in that period Potsdam Stadt), although still linked to Magdeburg and the ring. This line continued to Potsdam Babelsberg, but service to West Berlin was interrupted due to the construction of The Wall. In the middle of the 1990s, some years after German reunification and the opening of the line Potsdam-Wannsee, the station was rebuilt and renewed. The old platforms and the little rail hub, built in the early 20th century, were demolished. In 1999, the new name \\"Park Sanssouci\\" initially applied for tourist traffic only, but took the place of \\"Wildpark\\" about one year later.

Its construction was initiated in 1905 by German Emperor (Kaiser) Wilhelm II, and it was used as his private station. The first official guests were Theodore Roosevelt in 1910 and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. History of the Kaiserbahnhof at potsdamonline.de From 1939 it was used by the high command of the Luftwaffe and, during the Second World War, for the special train of Hermann G√∂ring, who was Luftwaffe chief. After 1945, it was the terminus station of the Blue Express, a train used by the Soviet military command on the route Moscow‚ÄìBerlin. Beginning in 1952, it was owned by the East German state railway company (Deutsche Reichsbahn) and subsequently used as a political school and cultural venue and for Transport Police (Transportpolizei) until its closure in 1977 due to deterioration. In 1999, the building was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Site.Potsdam's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Status: German and English version \\"Kaiserbahnhof im UNESCO\\" article at World Heritage Forum] The Kaiserbahnhof at info-potsdam.de On 16 June 2005, the station was reopened after restoration.

This was a special form of inheritance in which the second and younger son received more possessions and prestige than the apanage which was usual in principalities practising primogeniture. It avoided the generational division of the estate to the extent that occurred under gavelkind, and at the same time gave younger branches a stake in the stability of the house. Creation The creation of a secundogeniture was often regulated by a house law. The younger sons would receive some territory, but much less than the older brother, and they would not be sovereign. Examples of such house laws would be * the House Treaty of Gera in Brandenburg * the testament of John George I of Saxony and the of 1657, in which John George I's sons regulated the details. A secundogeniture is different from a partition. A partition creates two (or more) separate, largely independent states. An example of a partition would be the division of Hesse after the death of Philip I of Hesse. Nevertheless, there have been intermediate cases between a secundogeniture and a proper partition. = Examples = * Armenia in 63 AD * Brandenburg-K√ºstrin * Brandenburg-Schwedt * Habsburg-Tuscany * Hesse-Homburg * Hesse-Rotenburg * Palatinate-Birkenfeld * Palatinate-Sulzbach * Saxe-Merseburg * Saxe-Weissenfels * Saxe-Zeitz * Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg * W√ºrttemberg- M√∂mpelgard  See also  * Partitioned-off duke Category:Inheritance Category:Nobility Category:Fatherhood ","title":"Secundogeniture"},{"id":"33098391","text":"Jean Marie Laurain (1 January 1921 - 7 March 2008) was a French politician.

It was founded in 1926 to help Russian children whose families fled to other countries after the onset of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Society has refocused all of its efforts solely on Russia. The RCWS funds scholarship programs, medical procedures, pediatric hospitals, rehabilitation programs, and orphanages throughout Russia. History of RCWS In forming the RCWS in 1926, the Society's founders announced their commitment to improving the lives of Russian children throughout the world, outside of the Soviet Union, at the 125th Street YMCA in New York City. They embarked on their mission with a modest contribution that was sent to support Russian shelters in Latvia. The Society's many programs today reflect that legacy. The direction of the Russian Children's Welfare Society has been shaped by many of the 20th century's tumultuous events. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 prompted the emigration of large numbers of Russians to Europe, Asia, North and South America. By the early 1930s, the Society had ten branches operating throughout the United States and was sending money and material assistance to schools and organizations, assisting Russian children in Estonia, Poland, Finland, France, Germany, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, China, and Turkey. The occupation of many of these countries during World War II suspended much of the Society's work, which was prohibited after America's entry into the war in 1941. After the liberation of France from Hitler's occupation in 1944, the Society worked closely with the American Committee for Assistance to France and sent $25,000 in cash, food and clothing. By 1945, RCWS assistance was providing hot breakfasts in French schools, serving approximately 1,100 children. During World War II, the Society's leadership decided to professionalize its operations and expanded its staff. The RCWS eventually gained recognition by the Presidential War Relief Control Board as an approved charity for work abroad during the war. By 1950, the Society was again sending relief to 14 countries. Among the long-term volunteers of the RCWS was Princess Vera Constantinovna of Russia (1906‚Äì2001), a great-granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia and the youngest child of Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia. Princess Vera was born in Imperial Russia and was a childhood playmate of Nicholas II's younger children. At the age of twelve she escaped revolutionary Russia and spent the rest of her life in exile, first in Europe and from the 1950s in the United States. From November 1952 until 1969, Princess Vera worked at the Russian Children's Welfare Society, assisting with day-to-day activities of the organization. She died at the Tolstoy Foundation's elderly care home in Nyack, New York, at the age of 94. Princess Vera was the last member of the Romanov dynasty who was born in Russia. With the start of the Cold War, it became all but impossible for the Society to send aid to countries that were behind the \\"iron curtain.\\" The Society continued to carry out its work helping Russian children in western European countries, particularly France, as well as the Far East, South America and the United States. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Society shifted its focus and resources to assist impoverished children living in Russia, having received a $4.5 million bequest from the estate of Virginia P.and John Engalitcheff, Jr. in 1990. Since January, 2009‚Äì2011, the Society has disbursed over $3 million in direct aid to children in Russia through its medical programs, scholarships and by supporting orphanages, homeless shelters, hospitals, rehabilitation centers for disabled children and schools. Programs =Medical projects= Maxillofacial surgery The Russian Children's Welfare Society is currently working with the Russian Aid Foundation on a project entitled \\"Give Beauty Back to the Children\\" to raise funds for the Moscow Center for Maxillofacial Surgery to treat children with facial deformities. =Scholarship program= RCWS launched a scholarship program to help orphans transition to independent adult life and attain higher education. Since then, the number of participants has grown from 3 in the 2003-2004 academic year to 42 students in 2010-2011. To date, 18 scholarship recipients have completed their schooling and have found employment. Currently, RCWS is supporting over 40 students in the Pskov, Yaroslavl, Moscow and Velikiy Novgorod regions of Russia. According to the Russian government statistics 1 in 3 orphanage graduates will become homeless, 1 in 5 unemployed, 1 in 7 will commit a crime, and 1 in 10 will attempt suicide. To date, the RCWS's scholarship program has helped its students avoid these pitfalls by providing a complete support structure to students as they transition from living in an orphanage to attending a university on their own. =Orphanages= RCWS works to integrate orphans into society while also preparing them for the future. Many of the estimated 800,000 orphans in Russia are currently unprepared to take care of themselves or find a job‚Äîfactors greatly contributing to the high rate of homelessness, prostitution, crime, drugs and even suicide among them. RCWS helps orphanages meet basic needs as well as promote comprehensive programs that help children develop into healthy and independent adults. Solba Orphanage One of the RCWS partners, Solba, is an orphanage for girls near the picturesque Nikolo-Solbinsky Convent in Russia that currently supports 30 talented young girls. Since 2008, RCWS has transferred over $200,000 to cover the roof and other renovation expenses at the Solba Orphanage building, as well as support the theatre program and other educational activities. =Granny Program= Seven years ago, RCWS initiated the \\"Granny Program\\" to aid grandmothers who lacked financial resources to care for their orphaned grandchildren. After its initial run, the program expanded to include any broken families in strained circumstances, struggling to care for orphaned children. The \\"Granny Program\\" currently supports 11 families. Helping children with HIV/AIDS In 2007, RCWS started working with the Foundation ¬´Future without HIV/AIDS¬ª and the All Russia Pediatric Aids Center in St. Petersburg, which provides assistance to infected orphans and pregnant women. At the Pediatric AIDS Center there is a community of 40 sick and orphaned children who receive the attention of a dedicated staff of medical and educational professionals who foster their emotional development and integration into society. Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis project Over the last several years, RCWS has purchased specialized arthritis equipment for the Moscow Institute of Rheumatology and Sechenov Medical Academy. The Society has also helped facilitate training for Russian rheumatologists in New York and in Russia. Joint project with Smile Train In the fall of 2000, RCWS partnered with Smile Train, an American non-profit organization whose mission is to assist children born with cleft lip and palate worldwide. The project involved two of the most prominent Russian hospitals for children's facial reconstructive surgery: The Moscow Medical Stomatological Institute and the Moscow Center for Children's Maxillofacial Surgery. In December 2002, in order to help raise the standards of cleft care outside of Moscow, RCWS and MMSU hosted its 1st Training Symposium for 250 cleft practitioners, sponsored by The Smile Train and the Russian Ministry of Health. =New Year party= Every year, the Russian Children's Welfare Society hosts a New Year's celebration known as \\"Yelka\\" for over 1000 orphaned and sick children. In addition to the party, RCWS sends out festively clad volunteers and \\"Ded Moroz\\" (Russian Santa Claus) to distribute gifts at various children's hospitals. Events =Petroushka Ball= In old Russia, one of the most popular puppet theatre characters was Petroushka. According to popular lore, no matter his misfortune, he always bounced back to entertain the crowd. Igor Stravinsky, Michael Fokine and Alexandre Benois created a masterpiece ballet Petroushka, featuring the luckless but undefeated Petroushka who had fallen in love with a graceful ballerina. The Petroushka Ball, a traditional Russian ball held annually in New York City, is the primary fundraising event for the RCWS. The Ball was started in 1965 as an expansion of a small tea dance, by a group of members of the Society (Mr. and Mrs. Serge C. Bouteneff, Mrs. Ivan P. Obolensky, Mrs. Diane Eristavi, Princess Sergei Belosselsky-Belozersky) with a Junior Committee that was formed including Helen Basilevsky, Mafalda Chanler, Amy Gristede, Andre Kotchoubey, and Beatrice and Vladimir Fekula, the current President of the RCWS. To this day, the latter two still debate which one gets the credit for coming up with the name \\"Petroushka\\" during that first meeting. The late Helen Basilevsky, (granddaughter of White Army General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel), designed the \\"Petroushka\\" emblem which is still used on all of its invitations and programs. The first Ball was held at the now defunct Delmonico Hotel; it sold out and was an overwhelming success. It has become one of New York's most vibrant and anticipated annual events, attracting upwards of 700 dinner and dancing guests. Past Petroushka Ball events were held at the Pierre, Plaza (for almost 40 years) and Waldorf-Astoria hotels. Since 2002, the Ball has featured opera greats such as Anna Netrebko, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Rolando Villaz√≥n, Elƒ´na Garanƒça, Elena Obraztsova, Matthew Polenzani, Maria Guleghina, Diana Damrau. Kate Lindsey, Piotr Becza≈Ça and Paul Groves, as well as soloists from the American Ballet Theatre, Bolshoi Theatre, Novaya Opera and the Spivakov Foundation. The 47th consecutive Petroushka Ball was held on February 10, 2012, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

Their mandate is specifically the research and documentation of the history of St. John County, New Brunswick and, to a lesser extent, Kings County, New Brunswick. The society was founded in 1874, by Joseph Wilson Lawrence, a furniture maker of Saint John. The early society amassed a significant library of titles and documents significant to the history of the province, however most of this was destroyed in the Great Saint John Fire of 1877. Members of the society have included a number of published historians, notable public figures, as well as interested local citizens. In 1960, the society acquired a property in uptown Saint John known as the Merritt House, which had been occupied by the Merritt family since 1810. Since the acquisition the house has served as the headquarters of the society, as well as the Loyalist House museum, which attempts to recreate the Georgian era home of an affluent Loyalist Saint John family. Its current president is Kathy Wilson.

He is currently the Artistic Director of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre, Moscow. He was a pioneering figure in Russia‚Äôs underground art movement in the 1980s and 1990s and was one of the founders of the Soviet Parallel Cinema movement, which provided an alternative cinema to that which was produced by the state. His recent major works include a radical interpretation of Maurice Maeterlinck‚Äôs The Blue Bird, the opera serial Drillalians and the two-part The Constant Principle. Founder of the new processualism movement, a methodology and artistic strategy that posits theatre as the focal point of all forms of art involving every aspect of time, whether it be cinema, a musical concert or performance art.  Early life  Yukhananov was born in Moscow on 30 September 1957. In 1974, he began his career as an actor for the Moscow Puppet Theatre. In 1979 he graduated from the Voronezh Institute of Arts, gaining a major in stage and screen acting. He acted for the Bryansk Regional Drama Theatre from 1979 to 1980. During the early 1980s Yukhananov focused his interests on directing and enrolled in the prestigious directing course headed by the renowned Anatoly Efros at GITIS (Russian Theatre Art Academy). The course was run jointly by Efros and the equally famous Soviet director, Anatoly Vasiliev. Yukhananov‚Äôs first directing experience was as director's assistant to Anatoly Efros on the 1983 production of The Tempest by Shakespeare. Yukhananov also played the part of Caliban. From 1983 to 1985 Yukhananov was director‚Äôs assistant on Vasiliev's now-legendary production of Cerceau, written by Viktor Slavkin. This experience developed Yukhananov‚Äôs understanding of theatre, which later influenced his own method of directing. The most notable among Yukhananov‚Äôs early experimental projects is Capriccios, based on a record of the trial of Joseph Brodsky in a Soviet court. The lead role in this project was performed by Nikita Mikhailovsky. The subsequent friendship between Yukhananov and Mikhailovsky led to the creation of the aesthetically radical troupe called Teatr Teatr, or, Theatre Theatre.  Career  = Early career =  Teatr Teatr and the 1980s  When Yukhananov graduated from the theatre institute in 1986 he entered a world full of radical change and social upheaval. Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika program was only just beginning to be implemented. The systematic destruction of the current social order made many individuals question the fundamental principles and traditions, including those in the arts, which had held Soviet society together for seven decades. Yukhananov was one of the first directors to document these changes and express them through his work in cinema and theatre. In 1985 he created Teatr Teatr, the first independent (non-government sponsored) theatre troupe in the Soviet Union, and began experimenting with different genres such as performance art and new media art. He worked with a dynamic team of actors, musicians and artists including; Nikita Mikhailovsky, Larisa Borodina, Yevgeny Chorba, the band Obermaneken featuring Yevgeny Kalachyov, Andrei Zakharishchev-Braush and artists such as Ivan Kochkaryov, Yury Kharikov and Yevgeny Yufit. Teatr Teatr gave rise to a new brand of theatre. In productions such as The Misanthrope, The Fu-funeral, and Mon Repos, Yukhananov introduced his actors to a changeable mise-en-sc√®ne in which only the relationships between the actors and their characters were set. Yukhananov refrained from imposing a strict directing method on his actors. Instead he provided a framework within which the actors were free to explore their characters. = Soviet Parallel Cinema = Along with brothers Igor and Gleb Aleinikov (Moscow) and Yevgeny Yufit (Leningrad), Yukhananov was one of the founders of the Parallel Cinema movement in 1986. Together they created films that stood outside the state film-production system in terms of financing, aesthetics and thematics. During this time the samizdat Cine Fantom magazine was established. It was the first independent magazine about cinema published in the USSR. Yukhananov continues to be a contributing author and member of the editorial board. Yukhananov wrote about his video experiments in articles such as \\"Theory of Video Direction,\\" \\"Fatal Editing,\\" \\"There is Your Head in Your Hands,\\" \\"Mutant Imago,\\" and others. He mythologized the nature of video and reinterpreted the concept of film editing, rejecting conventional narrative structures. Within the Parallel Cinema framework he created a new art form called \\"slow video.\\" Through this medium Yukhananov suggested that artistic thinking must be continuous, must \\"not be text, but rather speech that flows and flows and flows, while seeking to express meaning.\\" According to this theory, the actor's approach to acting in the video format must be based on theatre acting techniques. = The Studio of Individual Directing (MIR) and the 1990s = In 1988 Yukhananov founded The Leningrad Free University with artist and philosopher Timur Novikov, avant-garde musician Sergey Kuryokhin, the Goroshevsky brothers, Olga Khrustalyov–∞ and poet and novelist Dmitry Volchek. Within the Leningrad Free University, Yukhananov established his own Studio of Individual Directing (MIR), in which he offered aspiring young directors an alternative training to that which was offered by the state. It was a platform for future directors to test the boundaries that existed between film, video and theatre. Yukhananov was not opposed to the kind of teaching that took place in state-run film schools, but he believed that diversity and experimentation and he sought to merge traditional methods with a more avant-garde approach. At the Studio of Individual Directing Yukhananov developed an integrated approach to directing, establishing a strong link between theatre, cinema and video and contemporary art. In the period of 1989 to 1991 Yukhananov directed a piece called Octavia, based on texts by Seneca and an essay about Vladimir Lenin by Leon Trotsky. Many representatives of Moscow‚Äôs underground movement took part in this performance, including: The Sever rock band, actress and medium Yekaterina Ryzhikova, Alexander Lugin, composer Kamil Chalaev and writer Avdotya Smirnova, as well as leading actors of the Teatr Teatr company ‚Äì Nikita Mikhailovsky and Yevgeny Chorba, Maria Pyrenkova, photographer Ilya Piganov, fashion designer Irina Burmistrova, Irina Piganova, Alexander Petlyura and others. The premiere took place in spring, 1989, at the opening of the Free Academy, an educational organization of which Yukhananov was a founder and rector. Throughout most of the 1990s Yukhananov worked on The Garden (alternatively translated as The Orchard, based on Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard) one of his most famous productions and the first to bring him international attention (it played in London in 1994 and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1995). Over a period of seven or eight years this production changed radically, going through what the director called eight \\"regenerations,\\" the last of which took place in 2001. One of the most interesting \\"regenerations\\" was the fifth, in 1996, in which important meta- theatrical roles were performed by actors with Down syndrome. In 1999, Yukhananov began work on an evolutionary version of Faust, based on the first part of the tragedy by Goethe. Over the years this production also went through several editions, or regenerations. The final, sixth, edition was staged at Moscow's School of Dramatic Art in 2009. The first staging in 1999 took place as an entry in the Pushkin and Goethe Festival and lasted approximately 6 hours. In 1997 Yukhananov headed up a course for directors and actors at RATI. This course within the official Russian state theater institute system lasted until 2002.  Artistic Director of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre  In early 2013 the department of Culture in Moscow declared an open competition for the post of Artistic Director at the Stanislavsky Drama Theatre. Applicants were asked to submit their vision and plan for the future of this institution, which had a rich history, but which, in recent years, had fallen into creative decline. The winner, announced in June 2013, was Boris Yukhananov. In collaboration with The Wowhaus Studio, Yukhananov radically renovated the old building interior - keeping all historical elements intact - and established an artistic program based on two guiding principles: first, the renewed theatre, to be called the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre, would be a ‚Äòdirector‚Äôs theatre‚Äô whose aim was to bring together the notions of avant-garde and accessible theatre; and second, the theatre would actively seek collaborations with the most contemporary and radical directors, composers and designers, both from Russia and other countries. In the theatre's first year of existence it unveiled productions by Theodoros Terzopoulos (The Bacchae by Euripides), Romeo Castellucci (The Human Use of Human Beings), and Heiner Goebbels (Max Black or 62 Ways of Supporting the Head with a Hand). Yukhananov in his theatre seeks to host and create innovative theatre, contemporary opera, unorthodox art exhibitions, installations, performance art and other cutting-edge forms. Following its opening on 26 January 2015, the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre gained a reputation for being one of Russia‚Äôs most progressive theatres.  Opera  = Drillalians = Drillalians is an opera series spanning five evenings with music composed by six leading contemporary Russian composers, based on the verse libretto-novel by Boris Yukhananov. All the composers are members of the ‚ÄòStructural Resistance Group‚Äô (StRes): Dmitri Kourliandski, Boris Filanovsky, Alexey Sioumak, Sergej Newski, Vladimir Rannev and Alexey Sysoev. Drillalians recounts the tale of a Drillalian Prince‚Äôs journey through time and space. The prince is a magician, a pagan priest and a classical hero. He undertakes his journey in order to save an ancient, other-worldly civilisation called Drillalia from destruction. The opera is set in the future but is interwoven with elements of the past and present. The first prologue to Drillalians premiered at Moscow's ARTPLAY Design Centre in December 2012. The full five- day serial opened in June‚ÄìJuly 2015 at the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre.  Theatre  = Maeterlinck and The Blue Bird = Boris Yukhananov‚Äôs three-day production of The Blue Bird uses Maurice Maeterlinck‚Äôs classic play about a young brother and sister in search of the blue bird of happiness as a starting point, but, in an experiment with documentary drama, it is enhanced by the life stories of Aleftina Konstantinova and Boris Korenev, two of the Electrotheatre‚Äôs veteran stars who play the lead roles of the eight and ten year-old children. Korenev‚Äôs tales of stardom as a film actor in the 1960s, and Konstantinova‚Äôs tales of surviving WWII combine with their tales about the history of the former Stanislavsky Drama Theatre, as well as of the recent history of the Soviet and Russian nations as a whole. The production features 300 handmade costumes and the set design includes the cross-section of a real Boeing jet fuselage. The premiere took place in February 2015. Boris Yukhananov, from the interview for the internet edition of Gazeta.ru, 2013; \\"We want to create a kind of documentary play made according to certain rules, which will become fleshed out in Maeterlinck‚Äôs fairytale. Actors will move along the emerging mysteries of memory and their destiny. Their own real recollections, dreams, phantasms will appear. The 80s, 70s, 60s, 50s, 40s- back in childhood, where in the fears and mysteries of children‚Äôs experiences the Blue Bird is hiding.\\" = The Constant Principle = Boris Yukhananov's production of a mystery-play titled The Constant Principle premiered in November 2015 on the main stage of the Electrotheatre Stanislavsky. It is a combination of two plays that run over two consecutive nights. The first night features the performance of The Constant Prince by Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca; the second combines various scenes from The Constant Prince performed in contrasting contemporary styles and concludes with a so-called \\"concert in a cemetery,\\" a performance of Alexander Pushkin's A Feast in Time of Plague. Calderon's play tells the tale of Don Fernando, a Portuguese prince, who is taken prisoner by the Sultan of Morocco after an unsuccessful military expedition. In exchange for his freedom, the prince is ordered by the Sultan to destroy the town of Ceuta, a Catholic stronghold in North Africa. Prince Fernando decides that his life is not worth such a sacrifice. He prefers to live and die as a slave in an Arab prison. = The Golden Ass project, 2015 to 2017 = Beginning in 2015, newly graduated directors from the Studio of Individual Directing began staging works at the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre based on texts by various Russian and European writers. However, the beginning point was their work on The Golden Ass by Apuleius (this novel, translated into Russian by the great Silver-age poet Mikhail Kuzmin, is generally known in English as The Metamorphosis of Apuleius). Apuleius' story of a would-be magician who mistakenly is turned into an ass, thereby putting the protagonist through 20 years of humiliation and deprivation before he achieves salvation thanks to the goddess Isis, embodied the overall concept of this project. In the spring of 2016 Yukhananov revealed a new aspect of this project, the so- called \\"open-circuited workspace,\\" in which various directors and actors staging various segments or chapters of The Golden Ass, gave public showings of their work as Yukhananov, in the role of Isis, offered commentary and advice. =Orphic Games. Punk-Macrame, 2018 to present= Orphic Games. Punk- Macrame, created by Boris Yukhananov and his students from MIR-5, has emerged as one of this director's most ambitious and radical projects in both composition and conception. Based on the myth of Orpheus and plays by Jean Cocteau and Jean Anouilh, this single work, consisting of 33 acts, and arranged in 12 performances according to the principle of frescoes, plays in one space and, in its entirety, is virtually inaccessible to a single spectator. This mixed composition of multiple fragments composed by young directors from MIR-5 evolved and entered into complex relationships with one another over a six-day period on the main stage of the Stanislavsky Electrotheatre. The spectator of Orphic Games travels not only through the space of myth, but also through the styles of modern theatre in their various manifestations. An essential part of the project is the work of contemporary composers Vladimir Gorlinsky, Fyodor Sofronov, Dmitri Kourliandski and Kirill Shirokov, who created a unique acoustic environment for the performance. Orphic Games, in fact, highlights the stylistic, substantive and generational diversity that exists among contemporary artists.

Retaining much of its original machinery, it is one of the best-preserved mills in Virginia. History Charles F. Mercer, a lawyer, Virginia legislator and military officer, obtained the right to dam the Little River and to build a mill in 1804. He built a house for himself across the Little River Turnpike, calling the complex \\"Aldie Manor,\\" after Mercer's supposed ancestors' Aldie Castle in Scotland. The village that grew around the complex was named Aldie in 1810. Mercer's father, James Mercer, had operated a tub mill at the location from about 1764. The new mill was built between 1807 and 1809 by WIlliam Cooke, who worked for Mercer under an indenture contract. Cooke built the mill, granary miller's house and store, as well as the now-disappeared distillery, blacksmith shop, sawmill, cooperage and wheelwright's shops, in return for a half-share in the mill operation. The original mill machinery was a system patented and manufactured by Oliver Evans. Much of the machinery, along with the original wood water wheels, was replaced at the beginning of the twentieth century. Mercer bought Cooke's share in the operation for $11,250 in 1816, leasing the mill to tenant operators. Mercer sold the mill in 1835 to John Moore, whose descendants operated the mill until 1971, through six generations. Description The mill features two overshot water wheels arranged one after the other powering the milling machinery in the brick mill building. The main portion of the mill is two stories, with two loft levels under the roof. It is flanked by a one-story section on the east and a two- story portion to the west. The village of Aldie grew up around the mill following its construction. Miller's House The historic district surrounding the mill includes two houses, the Mercer House and the Miller's House. The Mercer House overlooks the mill. It is a two-story Federal style house, covered in stucco and altered over time. The Miller's House, a two-story brick structure, is located behind the mill between the Little River and the millrace. The Miller's House has been expanded to the rear. Other buildings in the complex include a granary dating to the period 1809‚Äì1816 and a smaller \\"county mill\\" structure, used to make plaster. Park The complex is part of the Aldie Mill Historic Park, operated by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority, and is open to the public. The metal millwheels have been restored and operate the mill's machinery. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 15, 1970.

The episode was written by Eric Charmelo and Nicole Snyder and directed by Richard Shepard. The episode achieved 2.84 million viewers on its initial broadcast; reaching a three-year high for The CW in the Tuesday 9:00pm time slot.  Plot  After attending a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Bridget Kelly (Sarah Michelle Gellar) returns to the motel with FBI Agent Victor Machado (Nestor Carbonell). Despite being assured of her safety (she is a witness to a mob- style murder), she knocks out Agent Machado's partner Jimmy, takes his gun and runs away. She goes to New York City and meet with her estranged twin sister, Siobhan Martin. Bridget and Siobhan go to Siobhan's weekend house in the Hamptons. Bridget begins to apologize to Siobhan about an incident involving someone named Sean, but Siobhan insists that she is already forgiven and now needs only to forgive herself. They go out on a boat ride where Bridget falls asleep, waking to find Siobhan's ring in a pill bottle and Siobhan herself missing. Having been told by her that most people in her life don't know Siobhan has a sister, Bridget assumes Siobhan's identity to avoid both the mob and the FBI. She tells this only to her NA sponsor Malcolm Ward (Mike Colter) that her sister is dead and what she has done. During their phone conversation, she notices a man on the street watching her. The next day, Siobhan's friend, Gemma (Tara Summers), calls and tells that they were supposed to meet at Siobhan's loft that Gemma was helping renovate. When they meet, Gemma mentions her fear that her husband, Henry Butler (Kristoffer Polaha), is having an affair. Later that evening Bridget (as Siobhan) attends a fundraising gala with her (Siobhan's) husband, Andrew Martin (Ioan Gruffudd), who has recently returned from London. She sees the man who was watching her earlier, and tries to avoid him. To her surprise, when they meet, he gives her a kiss. It is revealed that the man is Henry, Gemma's husband, and that Siobhan was the one having an affair with him. Bridget-as-Siobhan refuses his advances. Bridget attends an NA meeting in New York and comes home to find Siobhan's stepdaughter, Juliet (Zoey Deutch), home from boarding school and having sex with her boyfriend. Bridget-as-Siobhan worries because Juliet has apparently gone through her drawer (where she kept the gun she stole) and took a scarf, using it as a blindfold. Bridget checks and sees the gun still there, so she hides it in one of the newspapers used in the under- renovation loft. Gemma sees her there (but not the gun). Bridget-as-Siobhan is later questioned by Victor Machado concerning Bridget's whereabouts. Bridget- as-Siobhan manages to maintain composure and avoids detection. Meanwhile, Malcolm walks out of a building, where the mob sees him. Bridget-as-Siobhan asks Henry to avoid her, and in the process, tells him about a recent phone call from a doctor telling her she's pregnant. Juliet, meanwhile, acts out to her father but is assured by him about him and Siobhan loving her. He later informs Siobhan (who is really Bridget) that Juliet got kicked out of Boarding School for doing drugs. Gemma calls Bridget and tells her that she thinks she knows who Henry is having an affair with and tells her to go to the loft. Upon arriving, she finds a man with a crowbar and tries to avoid him (this is where the episode starts). However she is seen by him and he tries to choke her. She manages to avoid him, and upon seeing the newspaper where she hid the gun, goes to it, takes the gun and shoots the man - while shouting, \\"I'm not Bridget!\\" When he dies, she checks his pockets and finds a picture with the words \\"Siobhan Martin\\" in the back. The final scene is in Paris, where Siobhan (now revealed to be alive) is called by a man who says, \\"We have a problem.\\"  Production  = Conception = It was announced in early 2011 that Sarah Michelle Gellar would be starring in a pilot for CBS entitled Ringer. Filming for the pilot began in March 2011 in New York City. The pilot was picked up to a series on May 13, 2011 by CBS's sister network The CW. Following this ABC Studios, which co-produced the pilot, pulled out from the series, citing displeasure of the network move. On May 17, 2011, it was announced that Warner Bros. would co-producer the series. = Casting = Sarah Michelle Gellar (pictured) was the first to be cast in the series.

It received a 1.6 rating in The CW's target of women 18-34 and a 1.2 rating in adults 18-49. The ratings reached a three-year high for The CW in the Tuesday 9:00pm time slot. On September 16, The CW re-broadcast the pilot, which brought in 1.87 million viewers, and a 0.6 18-49 demo rating. TV.com was enthusiastic about the pilot saying it was over-the-top with its \\"convoluted mystery\\" and they were \\"still feeling nauseated from all the twists and turns\\" which provide a lot of fun times. They also loved the late-60s vibe. Their last word was: \\"Outrageous. But potentially delicious fun.\\" Matt Mitovich of TV Line gave the pilot a positive review stating, \\"the set-up is sound, with some loose ends addressed and nice details sprinkled in. Tackling multiple roles, Gellar does a fine job as in-too-deep Bridget, icy Siobhan, and Bridget-as-Siobhan, and the supporting cast presents no weak link.\\" After Elton gave Ringer a positive review calling it \\"the single best new show of the year\\". Ringer was one of the Editor's Picks of Yahoo! saying \\"the first episode delivers so many shocking twists and turns, you won't be able to catch your breath. Heck, we're still catching ours.\\" Media Life Magazine gave a positive review \\"despite the inherent absurdity of the premise\\" stating Ringer's pilot was \\"deftly portrayed and dead on\\" and that it \\"justifies a return visit\\". Hollywood News made a positive review of the pilot underlining the fact that the show's concept was interestingly explored and the twists were crazy; adding \\"when it commits at this level, you just want to see what they‚Äôll do next. [..] Every act break has a soap opera-y twist, but it‚Äôs cool\\". E! News also gave the pilot a positive review stating the show was \\"intense\\" and described Sarah Michelle Gellar as \\"awesome\\" and \\"fantastic\\". Their verdict was \\"watch, watch, watch!\\". They loved the \\"film noir-ness\\" of the show while they admit \\"there was just too much stuffed into the pilot\\". The Examiner gave the pilot 4/5 stars praising its intelligence and complex storytelling, a welcome change for the CW. Stating, \\"Ringer is an intense thriller full of twists and turns that feels like a mini movie\\". The Boston Phoenix gave a positive review stating \\"Ringer actually knows where it's going\\" and praised Sarah Michelle Gellar acting, \\"it's a pleasure to watch Gellar back on the small screen. As long as she's in danger, she's entirely loveable.\\" The Hollywood Reporter gave a mixed review saying the pilot wasn't wasting time before \\"getting to the major complications\\" and that Gellar was \\"projecting gravitas\\" albeit their bottom line was: \\"unless you're weaned on The CW's fare, it really doesn't have a lot of weight, and Gellar seems stretched a bit thin playing dual roles.\\" But they will give it a few episodes. Hollywood.com gave a positive review as they featured Ringer in the Future Addictions category stating \\"It's dark, sinister, salacious and mysterious, plus it delivers the girl we all loved as Buffy back in action. [..] Yep, we'll be hooked.\\" Newsday gave a mixed review saying the main reason to watch is \\"Sarah. Michelle. Gellar.\\", that she looks \\"stunning\\". She might be able to \\"drag along the cultists from the Buffy, Scream and Grudge years\\" but the show doesn't fit the network as \\"it's inert, lackluster and a trifle old-fashioned\\" giving it a C+ grade. \\"Isthmus\\" gave one of the first negative review stating \\"Ringer is relentlessly cheesy and humorless, and Gellar is simply awful in her dual role.\\" Las Vegas Weekly gave a good review, putting it in the in-between category right after worth watching, saying it was \\"a little silly but also juicy and well-acted\\". Its soapy twists, thriller aspect and dirty secrets could lead Ringer to \\"unexpected directions that deliver pulpy guilty pleasures. Wait and see\\". Lincoln Journal Star gave a mixed review saying \\"Ringer is good, but not great\\" as it is \\"more fun to watch than nice\\". Gellar did a \\"perfect\\" job with Siobhan providing her with that \\"Cruel Intentions touch\\" but the problem is that \\"neither Bridget nor Siobhan is likable\\". They gave it a \\"C\\" grade but will \\"keep watching for a while\\" as the show looks promising. Ringer was one of the picks of the San Jose Mercury News as \\"Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a rousing television comeback in a suspenseful thriller\\" giving it a B grade and The Kansas City Star gave a good rating as \\"Gellar shines throughout the pilot\\". Their verdict was: \\"Watch it\\". The Post- Gazette Community Voices section gave the pilot a negative review stating \\"maybe over time Ringer will develop into a decent soap. But it‚Äôs hard to imagine it will ever compare favorably to its star's previous television series.\\" The New York Post gave a positive review giving 3/4 stars saying the pilot is \\"so good that it's CBS' bad\\" for having given away Ringer to the CW. USA Today gave 3/4 stars thanks to \\"two very good, well-defined Gellar performances\\" their bottom line was \\"you've been given a good show, CW. Don't mess it up.\\" However, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was negative about Ringer giving it a \\"D\\" grade. He explained \\"The lousy effects that put the twins in the same room are sloppy, and the story line - ripped from a cheesy daytime soap - is worse. Gellar hasn‚Äôt got a firm handle on her characters\\". The Spectrum gave a A- grade saying Gellar \\"plays both sides of the spectrum so well it is hard to believe that she has only just begun portraying these two characters\\".

Plot Ray Parker is a bounty hunter who just wants to do his job and be left alone, but when he's charged with finding and protecting a missing girl, he finds out that they're all souls trapped in a hellish version of Purgatory, and the girl is their last hope for escaping it.Hill, Bryan & Levin, Rob (2011) Netherworld Top Cow Productions, Inc. =Netherworld #1= Release date: May 11, 2011 Bounty hunter Ray Parker is approached by a mysterious woman, Alexis, who offers him a job: finding a girl named Madeline. Later, he gets the same offer to find the same girl from Seth, a henchman of Cyrus Kane, a mob boss who allegedly has the whole city in his pocket. Ray declines both offers - saying to Alexis that he only hunts criminals and fugitives; and to Seth that he doesn't believe in Cyrus Kane's power. However, Ray is intrigued. He tracks down Madeline at the nightclub where she works. When Madeline is cornered by three thugs outside the club, Ray steps in to help. He chases two of them away; but then, the last thug transforms into something inhuman. =Netherworld #2= Release date: June 2011 Ray incapacitates the monstrous thug and takes off with Madeline. He brings her to Alexis, demanding an explanation. Alexis gives Ray the truth: they are all dead, and the city is what used to be Purgatory. Now Kane, a demon from Hell has taken over it, and Madeline is the only one who can open the gate to Heaven and save them from an eternity of damnation. Ray must bring Madeline to the train station at the edge of the city; or all hope will be lost. Alexis gives Ray the power to see Kane's servants in their true form. Meanwhile, Cyrus Kane gathers up his henchmen and orders them to find Madeline. With Alexis' Men in White (the underground resistance group against Kane) no longer useful as they have revealed \\"The Gate\\" to him, Kane tells Seth to destroy them.

Ray and Madeline barely escape. =Netherworld #3= Release date: August 24, 2011 Ray, with the new power given to him by Alexis, realizes that Kane's demons are everywhere. He takes Madeline back to his apartment to get some supplies. Pursued by Kane's henchmen, Ray takes Madeline to find Stroman, his ex-dealer back when Ray was a junkie. To Ray's shock, Stroman is a demon, but he assures Ray that he wants to help. He gives Ray a map of the city. One of Kane's demons finds them; Madeline shoots him dead with Ray's gun. Ray and Madeline follow Stroman's map to where the train station should be, but find nothing. Alexis shows up, telling Madeline she's not ready to leave just yet. She explains that they are all here to redeem themselves for something wrong they've done in their previous lives. But it might be too late for all of them... as Kane's demons descend on them. =Netherworld #4= Release date: February, 2012 Ray drives away at breakneck speeds, demons in hot pursuit. They get trapped and fight off hordes of demons until Seth arrives. Seth stabs Ray and takes Madeline. As Ray lies dying again, he begins to remember his past. He was a special agent, working undercover with bank robbers. At the very end of the robbery, Ray turns on the robbers, and one of them shoots Madeline, who was just an innocent civilian in the wrong place at the wrong time. Ray is unable to live with this guilt, and commits suicide. =Netherworld #5= Release date: April, 2012 Ray awakens to find one of the Men in White, who supplies him with weapons and reminds him of the dangers if he doesn't get to Madeline before the train arrives. Ray storms Cane's building, guns blazing. He works his way through the demons until he comes to Seth. Ray asks Seth where Madeline is, but he won't tell Ray. They fight mano a mano, and Ray realizes that Seth was the bank robber who shot Madeline in his life on Earth. Ray kills Seth, and goes to the train station. Kane is there waiting for the train with Madeline. Ray tries to shoot him, but Kane proclaims that nothing from this realm can kill him. When the train comes, which is not from this realm, Ray pushes Kane in front of it, killing Kane. Madeline gets on the train, but Ray decides to stay in purgatory to help other good people get to the train.

Gerdes Civil War Page, Accessed 15 September 2011, http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/8bathis.html Organization The 8th Arkansas Infantry Battalion was formally activated at Little Rock on April 9, 1862, and was initially composed of eight companies It was the intention of the State Military Board to add two more companies and form a full regiment, however, events across the Mississippi River necessitated the immediate activation of the unit as a battalion, and it was rushed over to Major-General Earl Van Dorn‚Äôs Army of the West at Corinth, Mississippi. Initially under the command of Major John Miller, Lieutenant-Colonel Batt L. Jones was soon appointed to command the battalion. The unit was initially composed of volunteer companies from the following counties: *Company A‚Äî‚ÄúClark Rifles,‚Äù from Clark county, Capt. Newton S. Love. *Company B‚Äî‚ÄúChicot Rebels,‚Äù from Chicot county, Capt. James D. Imboden. *Company C‚Äî‚ÄúPeyton Rifles,‚Äù from Pulaski county, Capt. James J. Franklin. This company was originally organized on April 20, 1860, as a volunteer company in the 13th Regiment, Arkansas State Militia, under the command of Captain Daniel W. Ringo. The company was assigned to Borland's Arkansas Militia Battalion and participated in the seizure of the Fort Smith Arsenal in April 1861, before the state seceded.Edward G. Gerdes Civil War Page, The Peyton Rifles, Accessed February 4, 2011, The company was enrolled in Confederate service at Little Rock, Arkansas, on March 15, 1862, under the command of Captain J. J. Franklin of Little Rock. Captain Franklin was elected major at the regimental organization and subsequently lieutenant colonel. He was succeeded by Captain L. L. Noles, who was eventually promoted to major, and was succeeded by First Lieutenant John O'Brien. This company was eventually transferred to the 25th Arkansas. *Company D‚Äî‚ÄúBlack River Rifles,‚Äù from Lawrence county, Capt. Robert C. Jones. *Company E‚Äî‚ÄúGreene County Roughs,‚Äù from Greene county, Capt. Guy S. Murray. *Company F‚Äî‚ÄúWood‚Äôs Rifles,‚Äù from Craighead county, Capt. Joel G. Wood. *Company G‚Äî‚ÄúAshley Light Infantry,‚Äù from Ashley county, Capt. Micajah R. Wilson. *Company H‚Äî‚ÄúLawrence Dead-Shots,‚Äù from Lawrence county, Capt. Joseph C. Holmes. The records of the 8th Arkansas Infantry Battalion are highly fragmentary. The battalion‚Äôs books and records were lost on two occasions‚Äîat the battle of Corinth and the surrender of Port Hudson‚Äîand as a result most information about this unit comes from other sources, such as brigade records, casualty and parole lists, promotion and discharge records filed with the Confederate War Department, postwar pension records and veterans‚Äô reminiscences. The task of researching this battalion was made even more difficult by the fact that it was sometimes referred to in contemporary sources as (Jones‚Äô) ‚ÄúFirst Arkansas Battalion‚Äù and (Miller‚Äôs) ‚Äú2nd Arkansas Battalion.‚Äù On May 10, 1862, Capt. James J. Franklin‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeyton Rifles‚Äù of Little Rock, Company C, was transferred to the 25th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, where it became Company F of that regiment. The 8th Battalion‚Äôs companies D through H were subsequently re-lettered C through G. Since the ‚ÄúPeyton Rifles‚Äù only served with the battalion for a month, their history is not presented here, but instead is included in the history of the 25th Arkansas. With the loss of the Peyton Rifles the companies were re-lettered as follows: *Company A‚Äî‚ÄúClark Rifles,‚Äù from Clark county, Capt. Newton S. Love. *Company B‚Äî‚ÄúChicot Rebels,‚Äù from Chicot county, Capt. James D. Imboden. *Company C‚Äî‚ÄúBlack River Rifles,‚Äù from Lawrence county, Capt. Robert C. Jones. *Company D‚Äî‚ÄúGreene County Roughs,‚Äù from Greene county, Capt. Guy S. Murray. *Company E‚Äî‚ÄúWood‚Äôs Rifles,‚Äù from Craighead county, Capt. Joel G. Wood. *Company F‚Äî‚ÄúAshley Light Infantry,‚Äù from Ashley county, Capt. Micajah R. Wilson. *Company G‚Äî‚ÄúLawrence Dead-Shots,‚Äù from Lawrence county, Capt. Joseph C. Holmes. The unit's numbers were further reduced when Colonel Thomas Pleasant Dockery, commanding Second Brigade, to which the battalion was attached, issued orders on June 14, 1862, which required each regiment and battalion of the brigade to furnish a quota of men for the formation of a battalion of sharpshooters. The quota levied upon the 8th Arkansas Battalion was 29 men. After having to relinquish an entire company to the 25th Arkansas Infantry, and now ordered to give up more men to what would become the 12th Arkansas Battalion (Sharpshooters), Lieutenant-Colonel Jones vehemently refused to make the levy; too vehemently, for he was immediately court- martialed for refusing to obey orders and was cashiered from the army. Lieutenant-Colonel Batt Jones somehow managed to stay with his battalion. The proceedings of his court-martial, and subsequent correspondence relating thereto, constitute the single largest body of documents dealing with the 8th Arkansas Battalion. For months afterward, his immediate superiors wrote plaintive letters to the various division and army commanders, and to the War Department, asking for guidance. Apparently the order which relieved Lieutenant Colonel Jones never reached higher authority. The matter was finally resolved for all practical purposes when the battalion was surrendered with the garrison at Port Hudson a year later, after which Jones spent the rest of the war in a Union prison camp. It has been impossible to reconstruct a comprehensive roster of the field and staff officers of the 8th Arkansas Battalion. It is known that there were three field officers from April 1862 through July 1863: Lieutenant-Colonel Batt L. Jones, Major John Miller, and Major Micajah R. Wilson. The battalion adjutant, at least for a time, was First Lieutenant William B. Baird; the battalion sergeant-major was William P. Griffin; the battalion quartermaster-sergeant was Addison E. Roane. Four men are said to have served as battalion ordnance sergeant during the period April 1862 to July 1863‚ÄîJames R. Howard, John Carroll, William F. Lefils and William G. Rolfe‚Äîalthough why there was a high turnover in this position is not stated. Battles During the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, September - October 1862, the 8th Arkansas Infantry Battalion was assigned to Brigadier General William L. Cabell's brigade of Brigadier General Dabney H. Maury's Division of Major General Sterling Price's 1st Corps the Confederate (Army of the West). The unit participated in the Battle of Corinth. The battalion suffered significant losses in the rear-guard action at Hatchie's Bridge late on October 5, 1862, and from all accounts fought with great courage. Following the Iuka-Corinth Campaign, the battalion was assigned to the brigade of Brigadier General William Nelson Rector Beall in the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana, and formed part of the garrison of Port Hudson, Louisiana. They endured the siege of that place from May to July, 1863, only surrendering when the fall of Vicksburg rendered the defense of Port Hudson irrelevant. The garrison capitulated on July 9, 1863. The enlisted men were paroled on July 10, but the officers were sent to Northern prisons and held until the close of the war. :Battle of Farmington, May 9, 1862. :Battle of Iuka, September 19, 1862National Park Service, Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System , Confederate Arkansas Troops, 8th Battalion, Arkansas Infantry, Accessed 27 January 2011 :Siege of Corinth, April to June 1862. :Battle of Corinth, October 3‚Äì4, 1862 :Siege of Port Hudson, May to July, 1863Sikakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Florida and Arkansas, Facts on File, Inc., 1992, , page 84. After Port Hudson, the already-sketchy records of the 8th Arkansas Battalion become almost non-existent. It appears that some of the men, mainly the companies from south Arkansas, reconstituted the battalion for a time back in Arkansas. This remnant was eventually consolidated with the 18th and 23rd Arkansas regiments sometime in 1864 to form the 2nd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment. The companies from north Arkansas are even harder to track during this period. A group of the men, still identifying themselves as the 8th Arkansas Battalion (or Jones‚Äô 1st Arkansas Battalion) were captured en masse in Ripley county, Missouri, on Christmas Day, 1863. Practically an entire company of Davies‚Äô 7th Arkansas Cavalry Battalion seems to have been organized from veterans of the 8th Arkansas Battalion. Surrender The portion of the 8th Arkansas Infantry Battalion that became consolidated with 12th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, 18th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, 23rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment and the 12th Arkansas Infantry Battalion to form the 2nd Arkansas Consolidated Infantry Regiment which was surrendered along with the rest of the Department of the Trans Mississippi by General Kirby Smith on May 26, 1865, at Marshall, Texas. Other former members appear on parole lists of the unit surrendered at Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas, in May and June 1865.

These two territories had been created when in 1486 the Burgraviate of Nuremberg (the Hohenzollern's Franconian possessions) had been divided according to the Dispositio Achillea. The Burgraviate of Nuremberg consisted of a lower part around Ansbach and an upper part around Bayreuth and Kulmbach, separated by the Muggendorfer Mountains -- the term used back then for the mountain range now called Little Switzerland. At the 1486 division, the lower part of the Burgraviate was awarded to Frederick I and the upper part to his brother Siegmund. This division took the geographical conditions into account, but not the economic possibilities of the two new principalities. The soil in the lower part of the Burgraviate was more fertile and this led to Frederick receiving significantly more revenue than his brother. The House Treaty of Regensburg eliminated the imbalance by re-dividing the burgraviate into two economically equivalent territories. To this end, some towns in the lower part (Erlangen and Neustadt an der Aisch) were assigned to Brandenburg-Kulmbach. To determine the economic power of the areas, the average revenue from 1533 to 1539 was used. Another clause of the treaty stipulated that the Electorate of Brandenburg was indivisible. This principle had already been formulated in the Dispositio Achillea, and was made part of the Hohenzollern house law by this treaty. The immediate cause for the treaty was that Albert Alcibiades took up government in Kulmbach. He had inherited Kulmbach after the untimely death of his father, Casimir and had been raised by his uncle and guardian Margrave George in Ansbach. When Albert Alcibiades came of age, he and George agreed to realign their borders and concluded the Treaty of Regensburg.  References  * M. Spindler, A.

The tribunal is established under the New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993.Human Right Act 1993 The Human Rights Review Tribunal is one of two key human rights bodies in New Zealand and provides the mechanism for adjudication and resolution of human rights issues. The jurisdiction of the tribunal extends to cover matters from domestic human rights law, principles given in the Privacy Act 1993Privacy Act 1993 and the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994.Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994 Complaints may be bought by the Director of Human Rights or where it is deemed not appropriate to do so, a citizen may proceed with a claim at their own cost. The tribunal has the power to grant a wide range of remedies and in making a determination, is not required to give effect to technicalities but rather, the substantial merits of the case.Human Rights Act 1993 Section 105(1) The Human Rights Review tribunal also holds special status within the array of tribunals in New Zealands domestic legal system, with a far more significant legal jurisdiction than other inter partes tribunals. This special status reflects the fact that decisions of the tribunal can have substantial political and societal implications.  Composition  Members of the Human Rights Review Tribunal are normally selected on the basis of knowledge or expertise of matters likely to come before the Tribunal. This includes such matters as, international and domestic human rights, public administration, economic, employment or social issues, cultural issues and the needs, aspirations and experiences of different communities within New Zealand. The current Chairperson is Rodger Haines QC. At present there are 10 members aside from the Chairperson who are practising lawyers or who have legal qualifications. Unlike judges, the Chairperson is not accorded tenure.  Jurisdiction  The jurisdiction of the Human Rights Review Tribunal is derived from three different statutes, The Human Rights Act 1993, The privacy Act 1993 and the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994, with claims allowed to be bought where discrimination has occurred on grounds prohibited under these acts. The Human Rights Act protects against unlawful discrimination, such as discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, disability and political opinion. The Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994 sets out the standards expected of health care providers in areas such as respecting patient privacy, ensuring services comply with relevant legal, ethical or other professional standards, and providing full information. The Privacy Act governs agencies which collect, hold and use personal information. It does so by way of a set of Privacy Principles. Alleged infringements of the Privacy Principles (or of codes of practice made under the Privacy Act, such as the Health Information Privacy Code) can be brought before the Tribunal for adjudication. The ground on which a claim can be brought are therefore of a wide variety.Human Rights Act 1993 Sections 92I and 92J Claims process A claim may be made against another person or government agency, with these claims being brought by The Office of Human Rights Proceedings, a complainant or any other aggrieved party. Proceedings may be bought by the Director of Human Rights Proceedings. When making a decision on representation, the Director must consider certain factors including whether the complaint raises a significant question of law and whether or not providing representation would be in the public interest. Should the Director choose not to proceed then a complainant may bring an action but at their own cost. Proceedings are to be commenced by the lodging of an application in a prescribed form.  Hearing procedure  Sittings of the Human Rights Review Tribunal are held at such times and places as directed by the Chairperson. The litigants may represent themselves or acquire the assistance of legal representation. All members of the tribunal must be present at a sitting but the decisions are by majority. The tribunal, unlike a court, must act according to the substantial merits of the case and not be bound by technicalities. In exercising its powers and functions the Tribunal must act in accordance with the principles of natural justice; in a manner that is fair and reasonable; and according to equity and good conscience.Human Rights Act 1993 Section 105(2) The Tribunal may call for evidence, call on witnesses and generally require the evidence to be given under oath. The Tribunal adjudicates to the civil standard of proof and that is the balance of probabilities, and the tribunals focus is on assessing the parties conduct. Also the tribunal, if it considers it necessary, can dismiss any claims it considers frivolous, vexatious or not brought in good faith. Every decision that grants a remedy or dismisses a claim, must be given in writing with reasons. These reasons must include, findings of fact, explanations and findings of the relevant legal issues and its conclusions on such matters.Human Rights Act 1993 section 116(2) It is important to note that the option is available to the claimant to have the Human Rights commission attempt a settlement before tribunal proceedings, and should settlement not first be attempted, it is likely the Director will not consider acting on behalf of the claimant. Remedies The Tribunal may award a wide range of remedies with the appropriate choice being determined by the circumstances of the case. these remedies include, a declaration of a breach of the Human Rights Act 1993, damages up to $200,000 which is equivalent to the general jurisdiction afforded to New Zealand District Courts under the District Courts Act 1947 (s29). An order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach. A declaration that any contract entered into or performed in contravention of any provision of Part 1A or Part 2 of the Human Rights Act 1993 is an illegal contract. An order that the defendant undertakes any specified training or any other programme, or implement any specified policy or programme, to enable the defendant to comply with the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1993. Or any other relief that the Tribunal thinks fit. Special status among tribunals It has been said that the Human Rights Review Tribunal holds special significance in New Zealands tribunal system. The tribunal in granting damages, is the only tribunal accorded the full power of a district courts in terms pecuniary limit and significantly, has the power to issue a declaration that legislation is inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Such a declaration has wide reaching repercussions and requires for the executive to place more emphasis on human rights in the creation of legislation. The other significant feature of the tribunal is that its decisions can carry substantial political and societal implications which in term reflects its important role and function within the New Zealand legal system. An example is the fact that the tribunal can deal with matters of political sensitivity such as the human rights of prisoners. These factors act to show the fundamental importance of the Human Rights Review Tribunal. It is a fundamental body for the providing maintenance, access and the upholding of human rights in New Zealand.It has been suggested as such that the Chairperson be granted tenure to the level of a district court judge or even High court judge, however, these suggestions have not been met with legislative effect. Costs The costs associated with the tribunal are significantly less than those of litigating in court with the average per day being only $3,750. The minimal costs means that barriers to enforcement of human rights are minimised allowing access to justice. Further the costs may be covered by the Director of Human Rights Proceedings should the case be undertaken on behalf of the claimant. Should a claimant succeed on the merits of their case the Tribunal has the power to award their costs to be paid by the defendant.

History Henryk J√≥zewski In 1928 Henryk J√≥zewski, the former deputy minister for internal affairs in the Ukrainian government of Symon Petliura, was named voivode, or governor, of Volhynia, to carry out the program of cultural and religious autonomy for Ukrainians in that region. J√≥zewski, a Pole from Kiev (where, unlike in Galicia, Poles and Ukrainians had a history of cooperating with one another),Timothy Snyder. (2003). The Reconstruction of Nations.

Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press at the University of Alberta, , pg. 174 J√≥zewski brought Ukrainian followers of Symon Petliura, including former officers in Petliura's army, to his capital, Lutsk, to help his Volhynian administration. He hung portraits of Petliura and Pi≈Çsudski together in public places, founded an Institute for the Study of Nationality Affairs and an educational society for the Orthodox (which expanded to 870 chapters in Volhynia), subsidized a Ukrainian reading society (which by 1937 had 5,000 chapters), and sponsored Ukrainian theater. The use, in church sermons, of the Ukrainian language instead of Russian, was encouraged. A loyalist Ukrainian political party, the Volhynian Ukrainian Alliance, was created.T. Snyder, Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine, Yale University Press, 2005, pg. 67, 302, 384 This party was the only Ukrainian political party allowed to freely function in Volhynia. Its program called for democracy, separation of church and state, and equality for all citizens. Though many of its supporters, former officers of Symon Petliura, had committed anti-Jewish pogroms in Volhynia during the Revolution, under J√≥zewski's influence antisemitism was not tolerated.T. Snyder, Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine, Yale University Press, 2005, pp. 70-74 and pp. 158-160 Two groups competed with J√≥zewski and his pro-Polish Ukrainian allies for the allegiance of the Volhynian Ukrainians: the Communist Party of Western Ukraine and the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), based in Galicia. The Communists referred to the Volhynian Experiment as a \\"Petliurite Occupation\\", and set up a front party, the Peasant Worker Alliance. The Peasant Worker Alliance, whose affiliation with the Communist party was unknown by most of its supporters, grew to be the most popular party in Volhynia, until it was banned by Jozewski in 1932. Soviet-based partisans fought Jozewski's police in the marshes of northern Volhynia. While the Communists were coming to Volhynia from the East, Ukrainian nationalists entered from the South. The OUN saw Volhynia as fertile ground for the expansion of its Ukrainian nationalist ideal. By 1935 it was reported that 800 OUN members were operating in Volhynia; they had penetrated many of the Ukrainian institutions that Jozewski had created. According to Jozewski's rivals in the Polish military, the pro-Polish Petliurite Ukrainians in Volhynia failed to match the OUN in terms of organization and numbers. During the period of his governance, J√≥zewski was the object of two assassination attempts: by Soviet agents in 1932 and by Ukrainian nationalists in 1934.T. Snyder, Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine, Yale University Press, 2005, p. 15. Cancellation of the Volhynia Experiment After his sponsor Pilsudski's death in 1935, J√≥zewski's Ukrainian programme was cancelled. The anti-Ukrainian Polish elements in the Polish military took control over policies in Volhynia. J√≥zewski was criticized for allowing Ukrainians to buy land from Poles, Orthodox churches were demolished or converted to Catholic use during the \\"revindication\\" campaign, and by 1938 J√≥zewski himself lost his post.T. Snyder, Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine, Yale University Press, 2005, pp. 138, 147, 164-166.

(2005). Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to Liberate Soviet Ukraine. New Haven: Yale University Press, pg. 165-166 The Polish army Generals believed that filling all state offices in Volhynia with ethnic Poles would ensure fast mobilization and prevent sabotage in case of a Soviet attack on Poland. Ukrainians were systematically denied the opportunity to obtain government jobs. Although the majority of the local population was Ukrainian, virtually all government official positions were assigned to Poles. Land reform designed to favour the PolesSnyder, op cit, Google Print, p.146 brought further alienation of the Ukrainian population.Timothy Snyder, The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999, Yale University Press, Google Books, p.144 Military colonists were settled in Volhynia to defend the border against Soviet intervention.Timothy Snyder.

Despite the ethnic Ukrainian lands being overpopulated and Ukrainian farmers being in need of land, the Polish government's land reforms gave land from large Polish estates not to local villagers but to Polish colonists.Roger Dale Petersen. (2002). Understanding ethnic violence: fear, hatred, and resentment in twentieth-century Eastern Europe. Cambridge University Press, pg. 122 This number was estimated at 300,000 in both Galicia and Volhynia by Ukrainian sources and less than 100,000 by Polish sources (see osadnik).Subtelny, O. (1988). Ukraine: a History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 429. Plans were made for a new round of colonization of Volhynia by Polish military veterans and Polish civilians and hundreds of new Roman Catholic churches were planned for the new colonists and for converts from Orthodoxy. Volhynia after the Experiment The ultimate result of Polish policies in Volhynia was that a sense of Ukrainian patriotism was created; however this patriotism was not tied to the Polish state. As a result of the anti-Ukrainian Polish policies that followed the Polish government's cancellation of the Volhynian Experiment, both Ukrainian nationalists and Communists found fertile ground for their ideas among the Volhynian Ukrainian population.

At the Battle of San Juan Hill on July 1, Dodd distinguished himself while fighting alongside Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. He was also wounded in the Siege of Santiago from July 3 through July 17 while serving as a captain. When the war ended, Dodd returned to the United States for a brief time and was promoted to major. Philippine insurrection In 1899, the Filipino Rebellion began so that year the 3rd Cavalry sailed for Manila.Cozzens, pg. 267 For the next few years, until 1902, Dodd and the 3rd Cavalry remained on duty mainly in the Philippines, occasionally returning to America. In 1904 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed second in command of the 10th Cavalry Buffalo Soldiers. Mexican punitive expedition In 1916, at age sixty-three, Dodd was the colonel of approximately 400 men of the 7th Cavalry, stationed at Camp Harvey J. Jones, Arizona. Following Pancho Villa's attack on Columbus, New Mexico in March, Dodd and his command were ordered to ride south into Chihuahua, Mexico to participate in General John J. Pershing's punitive expedition. On March 29, Dodd arrived at the town of Guerrero, which was held by hundreds of Villistas, led by Villa himself. In what was called the \\"last true cavalry charge\\" in history, the 7th Cavalry attacked Guerrero and routed the Mexicans after five hours of fighting. Fifty-six of Villa's men, including one of his generals, were killed in the fighting, and another thirty-five were wounded. On the American side, only five men were wounded but the victory was not complete as Villa escaped capture with the majority of his men. However, over the next few months, the Villistas remained dispersed in the hills of the Sierra Madre and were no longer consider a threat to the United States Army. News of the battle quickly spread to the United States, where Dodd was acclaimed a national hero. Soon thereafter, the Senate approved his promotion to brigadier general. Although Dodd was promoted on July 3, 1916, he retired from the Army only 13 days later on July 26<\\\\--26 - 3 = 23, not 13-->, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 64. Retirement and death In retirement, Dodd lived on his farm near Ithaca, New York. He later moved to a home in Orlando, Florida, where he died on June 28, 1925. General Dodd was buried with his wife and one son at Arlington National Cemetery.Beede, pp. 218‚Äì219Boot, p. 199 Awards * Silver Star with three oak leaf clusters * Indian Campaign Medal * Spanish Campaign Medal * Philippine Campaign Medal * Mexican Service Medal External links * Entry in Cullum's Register References =Bibliography =  Category:1852 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Apache Wars Category:People of the Mexican Revolution Category:American military personnel of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Category:American military personnel of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Category:American military personnel of the Indian Wars Category:United States Army generals ","title":"George A.

Biography The band was formed in 1995 by Jonah Jenkins (Only Living Witness, Milligram, Raw Radar War) and was signed by Larry Jacobson to Irving Azoff‚Äôs Giant Records, aka Revolution Records. Miltown recorded several demo tapes on their own with guitarist/producer Brian McTernan and guitarist Matt Squire, releasing a CDEP (Hydra Head Records), two 7‚Äù vinyl records and one album for Revolution Records with producer Toby Wright (Alice in Chains, Jerry Cantrell, Korn) which was never released. After protracted internal and record label disputes, the group subsequently split. Jenkins went on to provide vocals for Milligram and Raw Radar War. Tales of Never Letting Go, unreleased album Tales of Never Letting Go was recorded in 1998 and was supposed to be the debut album of Miltown but, due to record label conflicts and negative intra-band dynamics, the band split up before the release. Up to now the album has never been released.

The building at 461-473 Market Street was long disused and in a state of disrepair when on November 10, 2015, a fire damaged it heavily. As of November 16, 2015, the armory was in the process of being demolished.http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-armory-set-for- demolition-1.1452978http://www.nj.com/passaic- county/index.ssf/2015/11/fire_ends_paterson_armorys_colorful_120-year_histo.html Certain decorative features, such as the keystone in the arch at the entrance, may be chiseled out and given to the Paterson Museumhttp://www.northjersey.com/news/demolition-of-fire-gutted-paterson- armory-begins-1.1454959 In January 2017, in the absence of proposals, the city relaxed regulations regarding the building site. to encourage re-use and redevelopment for commercial and residential uses.http://newjersey.news12.com/news/paterson-officials-look-for-developer- for-former-armory-site-1.13158190 In July 2018, the city announced the potential sale of the armory for new construction including remaining historical elements of the building.https://www.tapinto.net/towns/paterson/articles/20-million- redevelopment-of-paterson-armory-site  Architecture and history  Paterson was the first place in the state to apply for the construction of an armory under a law passed in 1889, and is built on ground which was originally 12 city lots and transferred to the state by Passaic County. The laying of the cornerstone of the Paterson National Guard Armory took place on Memorial Day in 1894, built for the state's Second Regiment. Completed in 1896, the 53,800-square-foot crenellated three story brick and steel armory is situated on 1.2 acres in Downtown Paterson., and has been compared to a fortress or castle. Soldiers were deployed for combat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, World War I and World War II from the armory which housed a unit descended from the old Second Infantry until 1956. The arena was a site of rallies during the 1913 Paterson silk strike. It was also used as a venue for the circus, concerts, boxing matches, and basketball games. Native son Lou Costello, before beginning his career, once won a competition imitating Charlie Chaplin at the armory. The facility was last used by the military in March 1983. and the building was not in use after 1990. It was later sold to a private buyer, and then taken over by the city for non-payment of taxes.  Preservation and re-use efforts  Sport was among the proposed uses in the late 20th century. Louis \\"Lou\\" Duva, boxing trainer and manager who began his career in the city, when looking for locations for a training center, cited the armory as a potential venue for a boxing club. Plans to restore the armory were under auspices of the city's parking authority.http://thealternativepress.com/articles/a-dream-or-reality-plans- for-paterson-armory-tak Proposals for a greatly expanded sports oriented facility were estimated to cost nearly $40 million, but funds were located to initiate basic repairs estimated at $9.8 million. Interest in restoring the city-owned building grew after the city council rejected a proposal to sell the building to a self-storage company. A 2008 feasibility study by Grad Associates estimated the cost of renovation to be $12 million. The roof leaked, and many inside walls and floors suffered from water damage. While the building is structurally sounds repairs would necessarily include asbestos abatement and new fire stairwells and electrical, plumbing, and ventilation systems. The plan called for state-of-the-art, green recreation and community center, as a way to reduce juvenile delinquency. A 2009 geologic survey found the site to be contaminant-free. A non-binding referendum to provide $1.2 million in funding for the restoration project was approved in November 2009. Julio Tavarez, city councilman, envisions, a recreation and entertainment center for the municipal property. During the flooding due to the 1903 New Jersey hurricane, 1200 people took shelter at the armory. When it was unavailable to house evacuees during Hurricane Irene (2011), Mayor of Paterson Jeffery Jones cited its potential in such situations as another reason for renovation.

He began his service under Prince, later Despot, Stefan Lazareviƒá (r. 1389‚Äì1427) as ƒçelnik, then was elevated to Grand ƒåelnik during the rule of Despot ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá (r. 1427‚Äì1456). He was very wealthy, and held the silver mines in Novo Brdo of the Serbian Despotate. Radiƒç founded and renovated several churches and monasteries which still exist, including the notable Vraƒáev≈°nica and Kastamonitou. He took monastic vows and became a monk in Kastamonitou where he spent his last years. He held the highest position, under Stefan Lazareviƒá and ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, and was the longest office-holder (ƒçelnik), and the most powerful political figure besides the monarch in his time. Origin and early life The bulk of both the Serbian and Ottoman army were destroyed in the Battle of Kosovo, including the Serbian Prince and Ottoman Sultan, and also Radiƒç's father. Radiƒç was the only one from his village who returned home alive. Radiƒç was born in ca. 1363 or 1372, in the village of Kamenica, to a family of miners, who extracted lead, zinc and silver from the Rudnik mine. Radiƒç's father was vojvoda Milutin, a lord of Gru≈æa. He was brought up at the court of Prince Lazar of Serbia and was friends with the heir, Stefan. At the age of 17, he joined his father's contingent and fought at the Battle of Kosovo (1389) under the command of Prince Lazar against Ottoman Sultan Murad I; according to tradition he prayed to Saint George and promised that if he would survive, he would found the Vraƒáev≈°nica monastery as a sign of gratitude. Some older soldiers made fun of his age, but he survived without a scratch, and became glorified as the strongest and most courageous fighter of the younger generation. The bulk of both armies were wiped out in the battle, including Prince Lazar and Murad I; although the Ottomans annihilated the Serbian army, they also suffered high casualties which delayed their progress. Serbs were left with too few men to effectively defend their lands, while the Turks had many more troops in the east. Consequently, the Serbian principalities that were not already Ottoman vassals, one after the other became so in the following decades. Service under Stefan Lazareviƒá Radiƒç had the title of ƒçelnik under Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá. Stefan Lazareviƒá wrote two charters in 1405, which granted Radiƒç possessions. In the same year Despot Stefan wrote a charter \\"from the glorious city of Boraƒç\\", which was held by Radiƒç. Radiƒç held a great estate in Upper Gru≈æa, at the foot of the Rudnik, where he would later found Vraƒáev≈°nica. He and Despot Stefan led the Serbian army that supported Mehmet I and defeated Musa √áelebi at the Battle of √áamurlu (Ottoman Interregnum) in 1413. He held not only Rudnik and its surroundings; he received 70 villages in, among others, Braniƒçevo and Kiƒçevo by Despot Stefan. Service under ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá Radiƒç was elevated to Grand ƒåelnik during the rule of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, in the first half of 1429. The Grand ƒåelnik was the highest court title of the Serbian Despotate, and the title- holders held great provinces, property, and honours, and Radiƒç was one of the most powerful ones. View of Rudnik. Radiƒç's lands were the mines in Novo Brdo and Rudnik, and the city of Koznik. Radiƒç held the Rudnik area (), which had the villages of Beluƒáa, Prodanovci, Kamenica, ≈†umeni and Vlasi Vojkovci; He founded the Vraƒáev≈°nica Monastery in 1428‚Äì1429, which lied below the Rudnik, in Vraƒáev≈°tica, which was composed out of five villages: Gornja and Donja (Upper and Lower) Vraƒáev≈°tica (Vraƒáev≈°nica), Grahovac, Konju≈°a and Brezova. According to tradition, Radiƒç lived in Beluƒáa, which later was called and still today bears the name \\"Crnuƒáa\\" (Gornja and Donja), after all of its male adults fell at the Battle of Kosovo, besides Radiƒç (belo ‚Äì \\"white\\", crno ‚Äì \\"black\\"). Radiƒç also received possessions in Banatska Crna Gora. Radiƒç also founded the monastery of the Great Annunciation (Veliko Blagove≈°tenje) in the village of Grabovica, near Gornji Milanovac, sometime before 1429‚Äì30. The church dedicated to St. Archangel Gabriel in Boraƒç, in Kniƒá, has an inscription dated to 1553 which name him as the founder. The Milentija monastery, in Milentija, which is mentioned in one of Radiƒç charters dated 1430, was possibly founded by him. In a 1433 charter issued to Vatopedi by Radiƒç, confirmed by Despot ƒêuraƒë, Radiƒç held the village of Halae, while Stevan Ratkoviƒá held Cerovac, in the province of Nekudim. Radiƒç did not stop at founding and renovating churches in his home region, as soon as he had gained wealth and status, he started reaching out to far away churches, as an example of the past noblemen and dynastic members. hegoumenos Neophytos persuaded Radiƒç to contribute to the restoration of Kastamonitou Monastery on Mount Athos. He became the second ktitor, and then took monastic vows and received the name Roman (after 1433). His spiritual bishop at that time was Marko, the Bishop of Arilje. Radiƒç spent his last years in Kastamonitou as a monk, the monastery then became Serbian. He was alive in 1441, and is believed to have died before 1456, when Despot ƒêuraƒë and his son Lazar Brankoviƒá (1456‚Äì1458) gifted Radiƒç's Church of St. George in Vraƒáev≈°nica to Metropolitan Venedikt.

History The idea for creating the group stemmed from Marcel Carn√©'s 1945 film Children of Paradise (Les Enfants du Paradis). Etienne Decroux, the father of French mime, plays the part of Bapties's father in the film. During the sixties Decroux taught painting to a group of musicians. Since these musicians learned to paint so quickly, Decroux reasoned that musicians could also learn mime and apply it in some new way to create a new form. The manager of the musicians Decroux taught, Lou Futterman, decided he would implement this new concept, and put together a new group of musicians who would perform in mime makeup and do mime routines between songs, never speaking a word to the audience. Two of the original group, Geddes and Blake, were recruited from the music school at Western Connecticut State University (called, at that time, Danbury State College). They were later followed by replacement Peter Weston, also from W.C.S.U. Peter and Greg sang most of the lead vocals for the album Fusion. Greg also contributed as recording engineer for the group, a career he later followed after ending the touring with Todd Rundgren. The Hello People were considered part of the anti-war music groups and were featured on both the Tonight Show (Johnny Carson) and the Smothers Brother's Comedy Hour. \\"Anthem\\", one of their most popular pieces, was banned in several cities due to the anti-war lyrics that had made it popular. Hello People performed as Todd Rundgren's back-up band and background vocalists on some of his early tours in the 1970s. They also were part of his Back to the Bars tour, singing background vocals and doing mime routines. They also were the main focus for TEAC's \\"Homemade With TEAC\\" LP, being interviewed about, and demonstrating their process of home recording, including overdubs and track-syncing, teaching people how to make Home Recordings using 4-tracks. TEAC's album was released in 1974 just prior to their own album, \\"Handsome Devils\\" which charted in 1974 at #145 in Billboard Magazine. The 1975 single \\"Future Shock\\" charted at 71.

Its coal seams were laid down in the Carboniferous period and some easily accessible seams were worked on a small scale from the Middle Ages and extensively from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century until the middle of the 20th century. Geology The Coal Measures lie above a bed of Millstone Grit and are interspersed with sandstones, mudstones, shales, and fireclays and outcrop in the Oldham district. The Gannister Beds or Lower Coal Measures occupy the high ground of the West Pennine Hills above Oldham where the most productive seam is the Mountain mine. The Lower Coal measures were worked north-east of a line from High Crompton to Greenacres and the Middle Coal Measures to the south-west. The deepest seam in the Middle Coal Measures is the Royley mine which is equivalent to the Arley mine of the Manchester Coalfield. The coal seams dipped in the direction of central Manchester and were broken by numerous faults including the Oldham Edge, Chamber, Oak and Great Faults. History Coal was got in \\"Lennardyne\\" (Crompton) in 1552 and 70 years later Richard Radcliffe left his coal mines in Chadderton to his son. In A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain finished in 1727, Daniel Defoe described \\"...Coals...upon the top of the highest hills\\" around Oldham. The coal seams were close to the surface and coal was easy to get. Exploitation of the local coal seams led to the rapid development of early steam-powered cotton mills and 65 had been built in Oldham by 1825. More than 40 collieries were operation in 1841 and the Chamber Colliery Company had seven pits in the 1890s. Collieries The early collieries were adits, accessing the coal from outcrops on the side of a hill at Crompton Moor, Oldham Edge and Werneth, employing up to a dozen workers. Shallow pits sunk from the surface with wooden headstocks were recorded in the late 1600s. These collieries had two shafts to aid ventilation. The Chamber Colliery Company's pits were sunk around 1750 by James Lees and the company was formed in 1877. James Watt installed a Newcomen steam pumping engine at the company's Fairbottom Colliery in the late 18th century. It was an atmospheric engine working at the low pressure of 1.5 lb. to the square inch known as Fairbottom Bobs. It is preserved in the USA in the Henry Ford museum. From the middle of the 19th century the output of the coalfield was sold locally to cotton mills and factories and for domestic use. Platt Brother owned the Jubilee Colliery in Crompton and Butterworth Hall Colliery in Milnrow. Bower Colliery in Chadderton was sunk between 1860 and 1863 on the site of an older colliery. It was linked to the Rochdale Canal and the rail network. It closed in 1922 when it employed 90 men. The Chamber Colliery Company had seven pits in Chadderton, Oldham and Middleton. They were Stockeld and Denton Lane Collieries, Oak Colliery in Hollinwood, Wood Park, Fairbottom Colliery which had a Newcomen- type pumping engine known as Fairbottom Bobs and Glodwick near Oldham town centre. Wood Park Colliery produced 89,000 tons of coal in 1954. It had more than 400 employees.

He ruled jointly with his younger brothers Louis and Henry VI.  Life  Otto was a son of Duke Meinhard of Carinthia and his wife Elisabeth of Bavaria, widow of the Hohenstaufen king Conrad IV of Germany. His father was enfeoffed with the Carinthian duchy by King Rudolf I of Germany in 1286, in turn for his support of the Habsburgs against King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Otto's sister Elizabeth was married to Rudolf's son Albert of Habsburg and became German queen in 1298. When Duke Meinhard died in 1295, his sons inherited a well- organized country, as their father had laid the foundation for an efficient administration by fostering ministeriales and creating the Tyrolean Raitbuch (internal record book). Otto signed a border treaty with the neighbouring Bishopric of Brixen, establishing the confluence of the Adige and the Avisio as the border between Tyrol and Brixen. Otto's brothers Albert (d. 1292), Louis and Henry VI were appointed Vogts of the Bishops of Trent. Otto's brother-in-law Albert of Habsburg, elected King of the Romans in 1298, granted him several tolls. However, Otto's lavish court was a burden on his finances. Most notable of his economic policies was the expansion and securing of the market in Gries (now part of Bolzano) in 1305 competing with the market in the central town of Bolzano, which was dominated by the bishop. Otto died in 1310 without a male heir. As his brothers Albert and Louis had already died in 1292 and 1305, respectively, he was succeeded by his youngest brother, Duke Henry VI.  Seal  Otto's seal shows a horseman and bears the subsequent inscription in uncial script: OTTO DEI GRACIA DUX KARINTHIE TIROLIS ET GORICIE COMES AQUILEGENSIS / TRIDENTINE BRISINENSIS ECLESIARU[M] ADVOCATUS.

They had four daughters: * Anna ( ‚Äì 1331/35), married Count Palatine Rudolf II; * Elisabeth (d. ), married King Peter II of Sicily; * Ursula (d. 1327) and * Euphemia (d. 1329/39).
