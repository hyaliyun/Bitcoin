She was noted for her omelette creation, the Omelette de la m√®re Poulard, which became a specialty of the region, and for her hospitality. Paul Bocuse wrote of her, \\"Mother Poulard is France!\\"  Early life  Poulard was born Anne Boutiaut on April 15, 1851, in Mou√´sse in Nevers to Claude and Marie Boutiaut, who were market gardeners. She was working as a maid for Edouard Corroyer, chief architect of the Historic Monuments, when in 1872 he was assigned the restoration of the Mont-St-Michel Abbey and moved his household there. At age 21, she met Victor Poulard, a baker's son. She married him on January 14, 1873, at Saint Philippe-Du-Roule. The couple rented the T√™te d'Or hostel in the Grande Rue du Mont-Saint-Michel from an uncle of Victor Poulard's the same year.  Career  Mother Poulard in front of her restaurant While operating the T√™te d'Or, Poulard noticed that many customers, most of whom were travellers arriving by ferry, arrived very hungry and wanted to be served quickly. Uncertainty about how many travellers would arrive and when because of the changing tides made planning ahead for service impractical. She created her omelette, known as the Omelette de la m√®re Poulard (Omelette of Mother Poulard) to solve this problem. Victor Poulard's uncle, seeing the restaurant's success, evicted them to open his own restaurant in the building. The Poulards opened Auberge in 1888 in a location closer to the docks. The couple opened two additional hotels, H√¥tel La M√®re Poulard and H√¥tel Les Terrasses Poulard. The original Auberge restaurant is now called La M√®re Poulard.  Hospitality  According to a contemporary account by the local priest, she gave customers \\"the impression that they were crossing the threshold of the family home.\\"  Omelette  Omelette de la mer√® Poulard There are many different descriptions of the way the omelette de la m√®re Poulard is prepared. It has been described as a souffl√© omelette made with cr√®me fra√Æche and butter. It is a specialty in the Mont-Saint-Michel area of Normandy and the \\"gastronomic emblem of the city.\\" According to one account, the yolks and whites are beaten separately. The whites are beaten until stiff and folded with the yolks. Cr√®me fra√Æche is dropped into a hot pan, which is placed into a hot oven until melted, then the egg mixture is added and the pan placed over a flame to cook. The finished omelette is rolled onto a plate and served plain or with a variety of garnishes. As of 2017 the omelette was priced at ‚Ç¨34 at the M√®re Poulard restaurant. Poulard herself responded to a request for the recipe with  Legacy  By 1932, the omelette was on the regular menu of every restaurant in the city, according to a contemporary. Food writer David Lebovitz called it the most celebrated omelette in the world. Paul Bocuse, after dining at Auberge, wrote in the guest book, \\"Mother Poulard is France!\\" In 2006 The Tribune of India referred to the omelette as, along with the Abbey, one of the city's major tourist attractions. In 2007, Le Devoir said Poulard became \\"a legend during her lifetime\\" and is considered one of the \\"mothers\\" of France, along with and M√®re Brazier. In his 2016 book Les illustres de la Table, Simmat Burniat wrote, \\"with her famous omelet, she is the first woman to write her name for eternity in the grimoire of planetary gastronomy\\". Anne Poulard's husband died on October 10, 1924, and she died on May 7, 1931. The couple are buried in the parish churchyard of eglise St-Pierre on Mont-Saint-Michel. Their epitaph reads \\"Here lie Annette and Victor Poulard, good spouses, good hoteliers.

The family left Ireland in 1881 and landed in Canada. They travelled through Halifax, Brandon, Manitoba and Regina before settling near Whitewood, Saskatchewan. Her father, Frank Cosgrave, was one of the jury for Louis Riel's Trial. In 1899 Sivell married William Sivell. They lived initially in Winnipeg and then moved a ranch near Medicine Hat, Alberta for most of their married life. They moved to a cottage nearer Medicine Hat in retirement. Sivell had done duty as a cowboy when her husband was ill. Sivell wrote poetry which was collected an published in a single volume which describes her experiences on the ranges. The book sold well enough that she was able to buy two stallions with the proceeds and it was republished on two occasions during her life. She later wrote an incomplete autobiography of her life on the ranch and the difficulties they faced. Sivell died in a hospital in Medicine Hat in 1962. She was buried in the city. After she had died her poetry was released again and the autobiography was published.

Biography Born in Eton, Berkshire, Joynes' father Rev. James Leigh Joynes was Lower Master of Eton College, and Joynes was educated there, then at King's College Cambridge. In 1876, he returned to work at Eton, teaching classics, but attracted criticism for his vegetarianism and habit of riding a tricycle. It was there he became friends with fellow vegetarian Henry S. Salt, who would go on to marry his sister Catherine Leigh Joynes, in 1879. In 1882, he read Progress and Poverty, and this inspired him to work with its author, Henry George. The two travelled to Ireland to investigate land ownership there, and were both convicted and imprisoned under the Coercion Act. Joynes wrote a letter to The Times about this, followed by a book, Adventures of a Tourist in Ireland. Eton's headmaster ordered Joynes to suppress the book, which he initially agreed, but then regretted and instead resigned from the school.Willard Wolfe, \\"Joynes, James Leigh\\", in: At the end of 1882, George found Joynes work as a journalist for the Irish World. He moved to London, where he was a founder of the Land Reform Union, and became joint editor of its newspaper, the Christian Socialist. He also joined the Fellowship of the New Life, and the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), becoming co-editor of Today, its monthly magazine, and serving on its executive committee. In 1884, he spent time working in Germany, and so resigned his editorial posts, thereby missing out on involvement in the major split in the SDF. Joynes returned to London in 1886, writing Songs of a Revolutionary Epoch about the German poetry of 1848, and training as a doctor at Middlesex Hospital. He began suffering from heart disease, and in poor health, he retired to West Hoathly, where he wrote poetry. Joynes died in January 1893, at West Hoathly.

She received international when she collaborated with Harry Kupfer at the Komische Oper Berlin.  Life and career  Born in Braunschweig a carpenter's daughter, Bundschuh grew up with three siblings near Chemnitz, then Karl-Marx-Stadt. House concerts, school choir and especially the church choir made her want to become a singer. Because she was not granted her wish, she secretly took singing lessons with Emmy Senff-Thie√ü in her home town in addition to her training as a textile master. She qualified for the Arbeiter-Musiktheater Aue, where she was admitted in the role of Dorabella in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte.In this regard, in her article Whether Judith or The Merry Widow, Anna Luise Zimmermann wrote: Eva-Maria Bundschuh fills all roles with her great skill from/her long way to success in Der Morgen dated April 4, 1986 \\"A Possessed One\\". Without the prescribed professional training one could usually not pass the , nevertheless she was allowed to prove her suitability before a commission of leading directors and theatre directors of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the Berlin artists club Die M√∂we. Thereupon she had the choice between three provincial stages. In 1967 she made her debut at the Carl-Maria-von-Weber-Theater in Bernburg (Saale) as H√§nsel in Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel. In 1969 she moved to the opera house in Karl-Marx-Stadt. In 1986 she reported on this phase of her life to the daily Der Morgen: \\"I was the Third Lady, the 7th woman and the waitress carrying a tray across the stage and singing a sentence. Everything was important to me, even from the smallest tasks I tried to do something. But for a five-minute performance for a whole evening this big heart flutter - should that be all?\\"Anna-Luise Zimmermann: Whether Judith or Die lustige Witwe: Eva-Maria Bundschuh fills all the roles with her great skill/your long way to success, Der Morgen, Berlin, April 4, 1986 Voice teacher Helga Forner accepted her as a pupil in 1972, and she won the highest award in the GDR National Opera Competition the same year. Her next position was in 1974 at the in Potsdam where she worked first as mezzo-soprano. Under Peter Br√§hmig she switched to the soprano repertoire as a result of various colleagues' maternities. Her voice range which extended three octaves was a merit of Forner, who was her teacher for years to come. During three years as mezzo-soprano, she portrayed Bizet's Carmen, Dorabella in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte and Princess Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlos). As a soprano, she appeared as the female characters in Offenbach's Hoffmanns Erz√§hlungen, and in the title role of Verdi's La traviata. She appeared as a guest at the Staatsoper Berlin from 1976. When she appeared there in 1979 as Cleopatra in Handel's Giulio Cesare in the production of Erhard Fischer she made a brakethrough.The original production dates from 1977. It is difficult to determine whether Eva- Maria Bundschuh took part in the production, since the reference works only list the premiere cast and not the alternative cast. She also appeared at the house as Marcellina in Rossini's Der Barbier von Sevilla and in 1979 as Freia in Wagner's Das Rheingold, staged by Ruth Berghaus and conducted by Otmar Suitner. She travelled with the ensemble to Japan.Zimmermann im Morgen: \\"[...] gave a guest performance with the ensemble in Japan. That is more than ever expected. She is happy.\\" The 1981/82 season marked the beginning of her collaboration with the director Harry Kupfer at the Komische Oper Berlin, which was highly regarded internationally. She remained there to 1988, singing roles such as Regan in Aribert Reimann's Lear', Musette in Puccini's La Boh√®me and Eva in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. In 1983 she appeared as Donna Anna in Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Leipzig Opera. In 1984 she was awarded the title Kmmers√§ngerin. On New Year's Eve 1984 she played Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss. Kupfer and conductor Rolf Reuter helped her, with assigning her the title role in the world premiere of Siegfried Matthus' opera Judith at the Komische Oper on 28 September 1985, to receive a special prize of the Ministry of Culture in the GDR. Towards the end of her time at the Komische Oper she sang the title role of Salome by Richard Strauss.

It was created in 1958 from the merger of the Langenthal-Jura Railway (Langenthal-Jura-Bahn; LJB) with the Langenthal- Melchnau Railway (Langenthal-Melchnau-Bahn; LMB). The name refers to the Oberaargau (Upper Aargau) and the Swiss Jura. The OJB changed its name to Regionalverkehr Oberaargau (\\"Oberaargau Regional Transport\\"; RVO) on 2 July 1990. In 1999, it merged with the Biel‚ÄìT√§uffelen‚ÄìIns railway (Biel-T√§uffelen- Ins-Bahn; BTI), the Solothurn-Niederbipp Railway (Solothurn-Niederbipp-Bahn; SNB) and the Oberaargauische Automobilkurse (OAK) to form Aare Seeland mobil (ASm), which now operates the 22 km-long, metre-gauge line from Langenthal to Niederbipp and Melchnau respectively.  History The Oberaargau-Jura-Bahnen (OJB) (Melchnau-Langenthal-Niederbipp) based in Langenthal was formed in 1958 from the merger of the Langenthal-Jura-Bahn (LJB) and the Langenthal-Melchnau- Bahn (LMB). As a result, the OJB is the direct legal successor of the LJB, which was opened in 1907 and, after the opening of the LMB in 1917, was also responsible for its operational management. The metre-gauge lines of the predecessor companies became part of the company's assets, including the almost 11 km-long Langenthal‚ÄìAarwangen‚ÄìNiederbipp line of the LJB and the more than 11 km-long Gaswerk‚ÄìSt. Urban‚ÄìMelchnau line of the LMB. The two railways, most of which are located in the canton of Bern have been electrified at 1200 Volt DC since their opening. As a result of the merger, cooperation with the SNB was renewed in 1959 under a new operating contract. The workshop built in Langenthal by LJB also became a workshop for the SNB rolling stock. The two companies also made their new rolling stock purchases together. Due to the sparse settlement along the LMB line, which primarily served businesses established along the line, and the long route to Melchnau as a result of the long eastward sweeping curve it followed, passenger traffic on the St. Urban‚ÄìMelchnau section was abandoned on 22 May 1982. The section remained open for goods traffic. Passenger services to Melchnau were replaced by buses, which allowed a significant reduction of travel time as they used a more direct route to Langenthal. An early sign of the later merger was a formal agreement that was contracted on 5 April 1984 between the BTI, the OJB, the SNB, the Oberaargauischen Automobilkurse (a bus company; OAK), the Ligerz- Tessenberg-Bahn (a funicular railway; LTB) and the Bielersee-Schiffahrts- Gesellschaft (Lake Biel Ferry Company; BSG) to form Oberaargau-Solothurn- Seeland-Transport (OSST). Construction activity in St. Urban led to a small increase in passenger numbers, which allowed the section of the LMB line between St. Urban and St. Urban Ziegelei to be reactivated for passenger traffic on 28 May 1989. The OSST partners, BTI, RVO, SNB and OAK, were merged into Aare Seeland mobil (ASm) in 1999. The LTB was also merged into the ASm in 2003, while the BSG continues to be legally independent.  Transporter wagon yard The LJB opened the first transporter wagon yard for the transport of standard-gauge freight wagons on a metre-gauge line in Switzerland in Langenthal on 29 December 1909. The delivery points, which initially ended at Aarwangen, were extended to Bannwil on 7 March 1913. The LMB carried transporter wagons to Melchnau from its opening in 1917. The SNB, which was opened on 9 January 1918, included another transporter wagon yard, located in Niederbipp, which was also used by the LJB. It served delivery points as far as Bannwil from Niederbipp. The whole LJB line has been served from Niederbipp since 1943. A dual gauge track was laid in the shared facility in Niederbipp, which was commissioned on 7 March 1970 and runs along the SNB to the Oberbipp siding to a tank farm.  Railway line after the 1999 merger  ASm route has been extended from Niederbipp to Oensingen, with the line running largely parallel to the existing SBB route. It was opened at the timetable change in December 2012. A tramway existed on this route under the LJB from 1907 to 1943 and it was occasionally used by the SNB.

Brandon (editors), The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press (1995) - Google Books pg. 1073 The production was directed by Michael Croft while the Musical Director was Colin Farrell. Adopted later by non-league giant killers, Altrincham FC. History During its first years, the National Youth Theatre (NYT) under its founder Michael Croft had mainly performed the plays of Shakespeare and the Classics but on a visit to the Victoria Theatre in Stoke-on-Trent Croft saw Peter Terson's musical adaptation of Arnold Bennett‚Äôs short story Jock-on-the-Go. Impressed by Terson's non-patronising writing for young performers, Croft immediately commissioned him to pen the first play to be specially written for the NYT, stating only that the new work would have to include a large cast. Two months later Terson sent Croft the first draft of Zigger Zagger and with it included a note that read: \\"At first I thought it was great, but then I was struck with the thought, 'Who‚Äôs interested in football nowadays ‚Äì it‚Äôs square!' But if you are interested in the idea and put your own schemes forward, I am still keen to work on it.\\" Croft himself was a football fan and was keen to put on the work which explored the themes of football hooliganism and tribalism and the hopelessness of life for many teenagers in 1960s society. Croft wrote of the play: \\"Zigger Zagger showed the dismal prospect awaiting the average lad, the narrow limits of his opportunity, the tiredness and cynicism of the adults in authority over him.\\" Zigger Zagger! Oi! Oi! Oi! How football‚Äôs first musical kicked off - The Stage, 1 September 2017 Croft set the action in a specially constructed football stand upstage with a constantly present crowd of football fans who acted as a Greek chorus - shouting at the audience, singing between scenes and taking part in the action.Robert Leach, An Illustrated History of British Theatre and Performance: Volume Two - From the Industrial Revolution to the Digital Age, Routledge (2019) - Google Books] The whole cast was on stage throughout the performance, with performers stepping out from the crowd to perform their scenes and then returning to it when not involved in the action. The play, with its cast of 90 and an average age of 17, was gradually formed during the four-week rehearsal period of improvisation and workshopping with Terson rewriting the dialogue \\"where he felt lines could be improved to suit the actor, and sometimes adding [lines] where the actor‚Äôs own personality sparked off fresh ideas about the part he was playing.\\" The original script was modified right up until opening night.

The play follows the story of Harry Philton, an ardent fan of his local football team who struggles between the life of sex, violence and drink that football offers contrasted with a stable future offered by an apprenticeship. Harry is about to leave school at 16 with no qualifications and no interest in anything ‚Äì except football. His stout-drinking mother wants him out of the house while she entertains a succession of truck-driver \\"uncles\\". His friend Zigger Zagger is a football hooligan who goes with him to the Saturday match with the intention of starting a riot. As much as Harry wants to be Zigger Zagger's friend he is unsure that he wants to go down the route of trouble, violence and hooliganism with him. Other forces from contemporary urban society ‚Äì including the teacher, the vicar, the youth careers officer, the family, the girls, the magistrate and the army recruiting soldier ‚Äì also exert their influence on Harry to get him to make something better of his life, and Harry starts to wrestle with his conscience. When his girlfriend runs off with his team's centre-forward when he is transferred to a bigger and richer club, Harry realises that football is an empty sham and he takes up an apprenticeship. The action takes place in the shadow of a football stadium which serves as a dominating presence throughout the play.

He was a leading figure in the Latvian decadent movement and an introducer of modernist poetics.  Early life  After dropping out of an Orthodox Christian seminar in Vitebsk, Eglƒ´tis studied drawing in Penza and enrolled at Maria Tenisheva's art studio in Saint Petersburg. There he became acquainted with the ideas of the Russian Silver Age and several of its prominent figures.  Literary career  Back in Latvia, he adapted the ideas of Russian symbolism for Latvian literature and art theory. In 1902, he used the term \\"decadence\\" to designate his writings. In various articles, he laid out his poetics which were opposed to moral schemes, abstraction and realism, and instead promoted artistic individualism. He was well received by a number of young writers, who along with Eglƒ´tis wanted to refocus the language of poetry, which was dominated by well-defined lyrical forms and clear narratives, to symbols and signs that were not always easy to decipher. With this they wished to provide a sense of mystery and prophecy, and leave room for subtlety and subconscious impulses. This poetic is prominent in Eglƒ´tis' poetry collection Elƒìƒ£ijas (1907) and short story collection Vƒìrtƒ´bas pƒÅrvƒìrtƒìjot (1911). Eglƒ´tis also illustrated his own books with symbolic drawings. In addition to the enthusiasm from his followers, Eglƒ´tis' often aggressive introduction of modernist principles was also met with vocal opposition. After the outbursts of his early works, the prolific Eglƒ´tis gradually turned to a more neoclassical and realistic expression; toward the end of his career he even launched the slogan \\"Away with modernism!\\" () In the 1920s he was an established and much read literary figure in Latvia, with works characterised by positivism and maximalism. From the end of the 1920s, he moved in an increasingly patriotic direction. He wrote historical fiction where he depicted the Baltic nations in opposition to other countries, primarily Germany. He turned to the Baltic neopaganism of the Dievturƒ´ba movement. Late in his life he also came to express antisemitic views and support for the politics of Adolf Hitler.  Death and legacy  In 1944, Eglƒ´tis was convicted in a Soviet court, accused of being a fascist collaborator. He died in prison on 20 April 1945. During the Soviet era, he was almost never discussed, remained unread and was largely forgotten. After Latvia regained its independence, Eglƒ´tis began to be rediscovered and gained status as the country's leading decadent writer. The literary scholar Vera VƒÅvere published a biography on Eglƒ´tis in 2012.  Personal life  Eglƒ´tis married the teacher and translator Marija Eglƒ´te (born Stalbova) in 1904. She died in 1926. In 1930 he married the painter Hilda Vƒ´ka. With his first wife, he was the father of the writer, journalist and painter An≈°lavs Eglƒ´tis (1906 ‚Äì 1993).

Lake Davy Old Forest extends around the northeast of the lake. The forest is located on a moderate slope covered with undifferentiated glacial till with good drainage, and covers . It is northeast of Havre-Saint-Pierre. The forest is in the watershed of the Watshishou River. The forest is administered by Quebec ªs Ministry of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Parks, Forest Environment Directorate. It was designated old-growth forest in 2009, and has IUCN management category III. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Nabisipi River Old Forest in the east spruce/moss subdomain. Flora The Lake Davy Old Forest has not been affected by major natural disturbances such as fires, wind storms or insect infestations for over 200 years, and has not been logged or otherwise disturbed by human activities. Some of the trees are very old or senescent, including trees up to 240 years of age. However, the trees are relatively small due to the poor soil and harsh climate. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea) dominates the forest, which is typical of the late succession stage of coniferous forests. There are many stumps and much wood debris on the ground, often at advanced stages of decomposition. The forest is renewed in small gaps that are formed when individual trees die or small groups are felled by the wind. The climate favors black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir, with the more spruce in the flatter areas and more fir on the better drained slopes. There is hardly any paper birch (Betula papyrifera), which indicates the low level of windthrow disturbances. The flora are not diverse. The undergrowth has fir, spruce and also shadbush (Amelanchier ) and withe-rod (Viburnum nudum). Red-stemmed feathermoss (Pleurozium schreberi) carpets the ground, in which Canadian bunchberry (Cornus canadensis) and threeleaf goldthread (Coptis trifolia)are sometimes found.

This does not represent the position in other countries. Antibiotics have been applied in mass quantities since 1951 in America, when its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved their use.Castonon, J.R. History of the Use of Antibiotics [Poultry Science, 2011]. Three years prior to the FDA's approval, scientists were investigating a phenomenon in which chickens who were rooting through bacteria-rich manure were displaying signs of greater health than those who did not. Through testing, it was discovered that chickens who were fed a variety of vitamin B12 manufactured with the residue of a certain antibiotic grew 50 percent faster than those chickens who were fed B12 manufactured from a different source.Ogle, Maureen. ‚ÄúRiots, Rage, and Resistance: A Brief History of How Antibiotics Arrived on the Farm‚Äù. Scientific American. Sep 3, 2013. Retrieved 28 October 2016. Further testing confirmed that use of antibiotics did improve the health of the chickens, resulting in the chickens laying more eggs and experiencing lower mortality rates and less illness. Upon this discovery, farmers transitioned from expensive animal proteins to comparatively inexpensive antibiotics and B12. Chickens were now reaching their market weight at a much faster rate and at a lower cost. With a growing population and greater demand on the farmers, antibiotics appeared to be an ideal and cost-effective way to increase the output of poultry. Since this discovery, antibiotics have been routinely used in poultry production, but more recently have been the topic of debate secondary to the fear of bacterial antibiotic resistance.Roth, Natalia. ‚ÄúHow to reduce antibiotic resistance on poultry farms.‚Äù July 27, 2016. Retrieved 28 October 2016. Emerging threats: antibiotic resistance The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), has identified the emergence of antibiotic resistance as a national threat.CDC. \\"Antibiotic Resistant Threats in the United States\\" CDC 2013. The concern over antibiotic use in livestock arises from the necessity antibiotics have in keeping populations disease-free. As of 2016, over 70 percent of FDA approved antibiotics are utilized in modern, high production poultry farms to prevent, control, and treat disease.O‚ÄôNiel, Jim. ‚ÄúAntimicrobials in the agriculture and the environment: Reducing the unnecessary use and waste‚Äù The Review on Antimicrobial Resistance. 2016. The FDA released a report in 2009 estimating that of antibiotics had been used in livestock in that year alone.O‚ÄôNiel, Jim. ‚ÄúReview on Antimicrobial Resistance‚Äù December 2015. However, surveillance of consumer exposure to antibiotics through poultry consumption is limited. More specifically in 2012, the FDA speculated the most significant public health threat in regard to antimicrobial use in animals is the exposure of antimicrobial resistant bacteria to humans.Federal Register. ‚ÄúRules and Regulations‚Äù 2012. These statements are challenged by the American meat industry lobbyists that antibiotics are used responsibly and judiciously in order to ensure effectiveness.American Meat Institute. ‚ÄúThe Facts About Antibiotics in Livestock & Poultry Production‚Äù. Consumer health effects Consumers are exposed to antibiotic resistance through consumption of poultry products that have prior exposure to resistant strains. In poultry husbandry, the practice of using medically important antibiotics can select for resistant strains of bacteria, which are then transferred to consumers through poultry meat and eggs. The CDC acknowledges this transferral pathway in their 2013 report of Antibiotic Resistant Threats in the United States.CDC. \\"Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States 2013\\", April 23, 2013.

For the 48 million individuals affected, antibiotics play a critical role in thwarting mortality rates.CDC. ‚ÄúEstimates of foodborne illness in the United States‚Äù 2011. In a literature review conducted by the Review of Antimicrobial Resistance 100 out of 139 studies found evidence of a link between antibiotic use in animals and antibiotic resistance in consumers. When a gram-negative bacterial infection is suspected in a patient, one of the first-line options for treatment is in the fluoroquinolone family. This, along with penicillin, is one of the first families of antibiotics utilized in the broiler industry. If this first-line treatment is not successful, a stronger class of antibiotics is typically used, however, there is a limitation on how many classes are available, as well as which medications are available on hospital formularies. There is also more drug toxicity affiliated with second and third line antibiotic options. This is one example why it is critical to keep as many first-line antibiotic options available for human use.Lautenbach, et al. \\"Extended-Spectrum Œ≤-Lactamase-Producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae: Risk Factors for Infection and Impact of Resistance on Outcomes\\", Clinical Infectious Disease, 2001. Retrieved on 28 October 2016. Other issues are associated with duration and complexity of infection. On average, treatment for non-resistant bacteria is administered 11.5 hours after diagnosis, and treatment for resistant bacteria is administered 72 hours after diagnosis. This is a reflection of the additional threat of prolonged incubation, leading to greater potential for systemic disease, with higher morbidity and mortality associated with opportunities for complications, and prolonged treatment time. For example, of the two million people affected by resistant infections a year, 23,000 will die.CDC. \\"Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States 2013\\", April 23, 2013.

Vertical integration This is the current business structure utilized almost universally in the broiler, or chicken bred for meat, industry.

They are the Agricultural and Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and the National Animal Health Monitoring Survey (NAHMS). Agricultural and Resource Management Survey (ARMS) ‚Äì Ran by the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The main focus is finances of farming, production practices, and resource use. Seventeen total states are sampled every 5‚Äì6 years per livestock type, with the most recent surveys distributed to broiler farmers in 2006 and 2011. There was one question about utilization of antibiotics in poultry food or water, excluding use for illness treatment. Antibiotic resistant outbreaks from poultry meat In order to minimize and prevent any residues of antibiotics in chicken meat, any chickens given antibiotics are required to have a \\"withdrawal\\" period before they can be slaughtered. Samples of poultry at slaughter are randomly tested by the FSIS, and show a very low percentage of residue violations. Although violations are minimal, these small amounts of antibiotics have still contributed to antibiotic resistant outbreaks in the U.S. There are five infectious agents that account for 90% of foodborne related deaths. Three consistently found in poultry are: Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli.‚ÄúThe Human Health Impact of Antimicrobial Resistance in Animal Populations‚Äù 2011. *2014: Outbreak of Salmonella in 634 people across 29 states (38% hospitalized) from eating chicken from Foster Farms that was sold at Costco. 44/68 tested isolates were resistant to at least 1 drug (65%), and 4 of 5 chicken samples tested were drug resistant (80%).CDC. \\"Multistate Outbreak of Multi-Drug Resistant Salmonella Heidelberg Infections Linked to Foster Farms Brand Chicken (Final Update)\\". 31 July 2014. *2015: Outbreak of Salmonella in 15 people in 7 states (4 hospitalized) from eating frozen stuffed chicken produced by Barber Foods.CDC. \\"Multistate Outbreak of Multi-Drug Resistant Salmonella Enteriditis Infections Linked to Raw, Frozen, Stuffed Chicken Entrees Produced by Barber Foods (Final Update)\\" 16 October 2015. Limitations and challenges One obstacle to gathering more comprehensive data on the use of antibiotics in feed is the majority of the poultry industry utilizes vertical integration. As a consequence, farmers are often unaware of what components go into the feed, including whether or not antibiotics are used.S. Sneeringer, \\"Restrictions on Antibiotic Use for Production Purposes in U.S. Livestock Industries Likely To Have Small Effects on Prices and Quantities\\", Amber Waves, November 2015. Also in antibiotic usage in general, there are criteria to define bacterial resistance to specific antibiotics, however, there are no standards to divide the bacteria into resistant and susceptible categories based on antibiotics utilized. The poultry industry also plays a large part in the United States economy, both in domestic purchasing and through international demand. The USDA reports that America is the \\"world‚Äôs largest producer and second largest exporter of poultry meat\\". In 2010, it produced 36.9 billion pounds of broiler meat and exported 6.8 billion pounds of broiler meat. This equates to an estimated retail value of 45 billion dollars in 2010.D. Harvey, \\"Poultry & Eggs: Statistics & Information,\\" Amber Waves Magazine, 22 August 2016. Both the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries have been lobbying against legislation that seeks to quell non-therapeutic antibiotic use in livestock since the first introduction of such legislation in Congress in the 1970s.S. Tavernise, \\"F.D.A. Restricts Antibiotic Use for Livestock,\\" The New York Times, 11 December 2013. Despite scientific evidence suggesting a strong association between antibiotic use in poultry and other livestock, agribusiness lobbies such as The National Chicken Council argue that there is not sufficient evidence to purport that there is a measurable impact to humans and shifts the blame of the problem of antibiotic resistance to overprescribing in the field of medicine.Frontline. ‚ÄúModern Meat: Antibiotic Debate Overview‚Äù With antibiotic restrictions, integrators will bare the immediate costs of these changes, and would likely result in modified finances and contracts with growers. Also, public health agencies may not have adequate scientific evidence for making appropriate decisions for better public health outcomes, secondary to lack of research funds. As a reference, America spends about $101 billion per year for both governmental and biomedical industrial research, which is only 5% of total health expenditures. Solutions Several policies have been proposed to improve data collection and transparency in livestock production. For example, the 2013 Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals (DATA) Act proposed the enactment of policies to acquire more accurate documentation of antibiotic use in growth promotion by farmers, drug manufacturers, and the FDA.\\"U.S. Congressional Legislation Relating to Antibiotic Use, 2004‚Äì2014\\", Washington D.C. The Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA) was enacted to eliminate the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock. In 2015, the Preventing Antibiotic Resistance Act (PARA) was passed with two components: requirement of drug companies to provide evidence that antibiotics that are approved for use in poultry, and that meat production does not add to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in humans.The Pew Charitable Trusts. \\"New Antibiotics Bill Addresses the Threat of Superbugs\\" 2 March 2015. Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs (ASPs) serve as an example of systematic monitoring and analysis of data via interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration.L. Chang-Ro, H. C. Ill, C. J. Byeong and H. L. Sang, \\"Review Strategies to Minimize Antibiotic Resistance,\\" International Journal of Environment Research and Public Health, 2013. Performing quality improvement in the process of livestock production is another focus. Some alternative methods include ‚Äúimproving hygiene, using enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, and acids to improve health and utilizing bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides, and bacteriophages as substitutes for antibiotics.‚Äù Adaptations of methods by other countries is an additional focus. For example, the use of antibiotics in feed was banned in Sweden in 1985 with no compensatory increase in antibiotic usage in other sectors of production, proving that a ban can be successfully administered without unintended impacts on other categories. Major producers in the poultry industry have also begun to make strides towards change, largely due to public concern over the widespread use of antibiotics in poultry. Some producers have started eliminating the use of antibiotics in order to produce and market chickens that may legally be labeled \\"antibiotic free\\". In 2007, Perdue began phasing out all medically important antibiotics from its feed and hatcheries and began selling poultry products labeled ‚Äúno antibiotics ever‚Äù under the Harvestland brand. Consumer response was positive and in 2014 Perdue also began phasing out ionophores from its hatchery and began using the \\"antibiotic free\\" labels on its Harvestland, Simply Smart and Perfect Portions products. Impacts of change As Guidance for Industry #213 has been voluntarily accepted, it will be a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to use antibiotics in livestock production for non- therapeutic purposes. However, as there is now a requirement for veterinary oversight and approval for antibiotics use, there is leeway in the interpretation of non-therapeutic purposes dependent on the situation. For example, per the FDA, ‚Äúa veterinarian may determine, based on the client's production practices and history, that weaned beef calves arriving at a feedlot in bad weather after a lengthy transport are at risk to develop a bacterial respiratory infection. In this case, the veterinarian might choose to preventively treat these calves with an antimicrobial approved for prevention of that bacterial infection\\". The FDA is not trying to regulate all antimicrobials at this time ‚Äì only those antibiotics which are considered \\"medically important\\". For example, bacitracin, a common antibiotic found in over the counter antibiotic ointments, is not classified as \\"medically important\\". Ionophores, which are not a part of human medicine but given for improving the health of livestock, are also not included in this regulation.

It flows to the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. There are two hydroelectric dams on the river at a point where a waterfall used to prevent salmon from going further upstream. A system to capture and transport salmon upstream was installed in 1965, and the river now has a healthy salmon population along its whole length. Course The Mitis River originates in Lake Mitis in the Notre Dame Mountains, at an elevation of . Lake Mitis is a large reservoir long formed from the Superior, Croix and Inferior lakes. The Mitis dam and the hamlet of Lac-Mitis are at the source of the river. The river is swelled by many tributaries as it flows north for . Towards its mouth, in the Price municipality near Mont-Joli, the river meanders before being crossed by the Mitis-1 and Mitis-2 dams. It ends in the Baie Mitis on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence. Its mouth is near Sainte-Flavie, about east of Rimouski. The Mitis River is between the Matane and Rimouski rivers. It gives its name to La Mitis Regional County Municipality. The main tributaries are the Neigette and Mistigoug√®che rivers. The average flow is , a steady rate due to the two dams built in the first half of the 20th century. The river can be accessed from a path that runs along its length. The river bed has fairly large rocks and red clay, but little gravel. The clay gives the clear river water a slightly reddish tinge after a heavy rainfall. Name The name was given by the Listuguj MiÍûågmaq First Nation of Restigouche, who used to use it as a route to the Saint Lawrence. It appears in the title deed of the Seigneurie de Mitis, dated 6 May 1675. Dams In the early 20th century Jules-Andr√© Brillant (1888‚Äì1973), a local entrepreneur, formed the Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas-Saint-Laurent (Lower Saint Lawrence Power Company). He found investors in Rimouski, purchased the Elsie Reford Falls and had a dam built above the falls. On 22 October 1922 the 2.75 MW turbine came into service. It was formally inaugurated in a ceremony on 1 July 1923 attended by various notables. The company grew into the largest power supplier in the region with a network of transmission lines serving Matane, Mont-Joli, Rimouski and beyond. A 3 MW turbine was added in 1930. The second dam, now called Mitis-2, was completed in 1947 below the first dam. In 1963 the government of Quebec nationalized the production of electricity and created Hydro-Qu√©bec as a public utility, which took over management of the Mitis-1 and Mitis-2 dams. In 1965 a salmon capture station was installed at the foot of Mitis-2, with a system to transport the fish above the dams to a point about upstream near the mouth of the Neigette River. With this change the salmon population grew rapidly from an estimated 20 fish in 1965 to 1,200 by 1992. Activities The river is used for fishing, canoeing and swimming. Inflatable boats can be used to descend the river from the lake. The Parc de la Rivi√®re Mitis is opposite the historical Jardins de M√©tis. The regional park has just over of hiking trails. It also provides a dozen camping sites beside the Saint Lawrence. Fishing Map of the lower section of the river showing the pools and pockets (1923) The river is one of 22 salmon rivers in the Gasp√© Peninsula. Historians think that the Mal√©cites / Maliseet Indians fished for eel and salmon at the mouth of the river, although they may not have had permanent villages. Fish are numerous, and include Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), Eastern blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). George Stephen, co-founder of the Canadian Pacific Railway, established the first fishing camp on the river in 1886. His niece Elsie Reford converted the camp into the Jardins de M√©tis. At that time salmon could only reach upstream, where they were stopped by a waterfall. Salmon were also affected until 1979 by logs being floated downstream. The river was opened to the public for salmon fishing in 1977. In 1993 it became a ZEC (zone d'exploitation contr√¥l√©e: controlled use zone), Zec de la Rivi√®re-Mitis, managed by the Mitis River Sport Fishing Management Corporation. There are three fishing areas, one private and the other two open to the public, with 33 pools, mostly fished with waders. The ZEC de la rivi√®re Mitis covers about of the river. Lake Mitis has a large population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Brook trout is found in Lake Mitis and in several water bodies and streams in the region. In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec.

He owned Valbyg√•rd at Slagelse and Borupg√•rd at Borup. Valbyg√•rd is still owned by his descendants. Early life and education Bech was born on 21 July 1815 in Copenhagen, the son of merchant and ship-owner J√∏rgen Peter Bech (1782‚Äì1846) and Ellen Sophie Magdalene Meyer (1784‚Äì1846). He grew up in his father's house at Nybrogade 22 and later studied agriculture in Denmark and Mecklenburg. Career Valbyg√•rd's new main building in 1860 In 1840, Bech purchased Fredsholm at Nakskov on Lolland. He purchased Valbyg√•rd at Slagelse for 500,000 Danish rigsdaler in 1846 and sold Fredsholm the following year. He modernized the operations and converted many of the copyholds to freeholds. He also constructed a number of new buildings on the estate. In 1855, he also acquired nearby Brorupg√•rd. The two estates had a combined area of more than 600 hectares and were mainly used for breeding of cattle. He also operated a modern dairy on his estate. He was also a pioneer of cultivation of root crops. In 1856, he also purchased Moselund in Engesvang at Silkeborg. He planted forest on most of the estate. Bech was from 1855 and until his death a member of Sor√∏ County Council. Personal life Bech married Kirstine Margrethe (Grethe) Rothe (7 June 1823 - 21 March 1886), a daughter of counter admiral Carl A.

Background At the time the Constitution provided that: > XVIII. Any person holding any Office of Profit under the Crown, or having a > Pension from the Crown during Pleasure or for Term of Years, shall be > incapable of being elected, or of sitting or voting as a Member of the > Legislative Assembly, unless he be One of the following official Members of > the Government, that is to say, the Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer, > Auditor General, Attorney General, and Solicitor General, or One of such > additional Officers, not being more than Five, as the Governor, with the > advice of the Executive Council, may from Time to Time, by a notice in the > Government Gazette, declare capable of being elected a Member of the said > Assembly. Adolphus Taylor argued that the Governor had already issued five proclamations prior to the appointment of Suttor and thus the appointments of Suttor and Reid to the office of Minister for Public Instruction meant they were disqualified. The Elections and Qualifications Committee agreed, declaring that both Suttor and Reid held an office of profit under the crown and they were both disqualified from holding office. Results The Committee of Elections and Qualifications held that an error in the drafting of the constitution meant that Francis Suttor could not be validly appointed Minister of Public Instruction and declared his seat vacant. Aftermath While Suttor was unopposed, Reid was defeated in the East Sydney by-election. The errors were remedied by the Constitution Act Amendment Act 1884.

This event is organized in a modern fashion, since 1952. Because it attracts thousands of visitors every year, it eventually became the trademark event of the city. Mixing local traditions with Samba school parades (since 1983) it stands as one of the most traditional celebrations in Portugal. It is also, arguably, claimed as the best Carnaval in the country. History While the Ovar Carnival Celebrations are first mentioned in local newspapers, as early as the late 19th century, a more similar version of the current event was established around the 1950s, the so- called \\"Dirty Carnival\\". It consisted in a \\"dirty battle\\", using flour, eggs, dust or soot. The modern Organized Carnival was held for the first time in 1952, when various groups of friends, organized by neighborhoods, began to celebrate Carnival in a more creative and orderly way. Eventually, all Ovar neighborhoods joined the competition, and its popularity started to attract an increasing number of tourists. In 1983, the first samba school in Ovar, Costa de Prata, started the contemporary era of the Ovar Carnival, introducing its current samba element.

Multiple water studies were conducted by both federal agencies, like the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and non-profit groups. The lead levels exceeded the limit of 15 parts per billion set by the Safe Drinking Water Act. As a result, the EPA ordered the City of Newark to provide bottled water and filters to affected customers. As of January 2020, more than 200,000 residents were affected by the elevated levels of lead.  Background  Much of the drinking water in Newark, and Northern New Jersey in general, comes from reservoirs. Drinking water then is processed through water treatment plants to the final destinations throughout the region. The water pipes that connect the main pipes to homes and businesses were lined with lead along with other chemicals. The water destroyed the lead-lined pipes, causing the lead to leak into the water supply. The management of the city's water safety plan is under the jurisdiction of the Newark Watershed Conservation and Development Corporation (NWCDC), under the direction of a board appointed by the mayor of Newark. The New Jersey State Comptroller released a report in 2014 detailing widespread corruption throughout the agency. In early 2016, multiple agency officials were arrested and charged with accepting bribes.  Lead Exposure  Lead poisoning often occurs with no obvious symptoms, it frequently goes unrecognized. Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and, at very high levels, seizures, coma, and even death. No safe blood lead level has been identified. Pregnant women and children are most at risk. Lead exposure has been on the rise in New jersey, especially in children. The highest numbers come from Newark in 2017, where 281 children between six months old and 26 months old tested in the city showed high lead levels in their blood. Newark addresses the issue of elevated blood lead levels in children through several means and has been allotted and continues to seek grants from governmental and non-governmental sources. In the past decade, Newark established and locally administers the State‚Äôs only Lead-Safe Houses. The Lead-Safe Houses are used to relocate residents who have a child with an Elevated blood lead level (10 ¬µg/dL or greater) when the family has no other temporary lead-safe housing alternatives.  Timeline  = 2016 = State and federal environment officials said that lead levels in multiple Newark Public Schools buildings were higher than the federal limit in March 2016. The trade union representing Newark public school teachers and the New Jersey Sierra Club said that the school leadership knew of the lead problem in the drinking water. = 2017 = New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection mandated cities and towns to test the water supply twice a year. A report published by the City of Newark stated the city was in violation of the EPA's limit of lead levels in the drinking water. = 2018 = In February 2018, engineering company CDM Smith said in an email to the City of Newark stated their prevention of lead pipes dissolving into the water system \\"has not been effective\\". Subsequently, Newark distributed Pur water filters to affective residents. = 2019 = In August 2019, the city government received $120 million in funds to replace lead drinking water pipes throughout the city. = 2020 = According to new tests conducted by the state of New Jersey, lead levels have dropped.  Response and aftermath  Several news outlets, including The New York Times, compared the water crisis to the one in Flint, Michigan. The Natural Resources Defense Council sued the Newark city government in 2018, saying the city has violated federal and state regulations regarding lead levels in drinking water. Mayor of Newark wrote a letter to the President of the United States Donald Trump, asking for federal assistance and funds to help repair and rebuild the water infrastructure. Introduced in September 2019, the Water Infrastructure Funding Transfer Act was passed by the United States Senate. It was sponsored by New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. The law allows the transfer the funds from the federal water fund to states. It was signed into law on September 27, 2019. = City response = In March 2019, Newark announced the Lead Service Line Replacement Program, which aimed to remove all 18,000 lead pipes throughout the water system. More than 38,000 water filters were distributed to city residents, in addition to bottled water. A November 2019 report released by the Newark city government said that \\"97.5% of the filters reduced lead to 10 parts-per-billion (ppb) or below.\\"  References  Category:2016 in New Jersey Category:2017 in New Jersey Category:2018 in New Jersey Category:2019 in New Jersey Category:Environment of New Jersey Category:Health in New Jersey Category:Lead poisoning incidents Category:2019 health disasters Category:2019 disasters in the United States Category:Newark, New Jersey ","title":"Newark water crisis"},{"id":"61880295","text":"Michael Pellegrino (born January 18, 2001) is an American soccer player who currently plays college soccer at the University of Notre Dame.

He showed considerable interest in astronomy from his youth, and published more than 10 astronomical studies from 1672 on. His main contribution was his observation that the two comets observed in 1680/81 were in fact one and the same, describing a parabolic path around the Sun. This was the Great Comet of 1680. While others like John Flamsteed also drew the conclusion that there was only one comet involved here, D√∂rffel was the first to correctly calculate its trajectory.

It can be considered part of the hypothalamus and diencephalon. The nucleus can be divided into medial and lateral sections. The medial SuM, or SuMM, is made of smaller cells which release dopamine and give input to the lateral septal nucleus. The lateral SuM, or SuML, is made of larger cells that project to the hippocampus.  Functions  Although the exact function of the supramammillary nucleus is still not clear, it is known that the SuM plays a role in modulating theta frequencies. Because of its role in modulating hippocampal theta, it is implicated in spatial and emotional memory formation.The axons of SuM neurons make monosynaptic connections to granule cells and GABAergic interneurons in the dentate gyrus. The SuM projects it's afferent signals exclusively to the dentate gyrus and CA2 region of the hippocampus. These SuM neurons will co- release glutamate and GABA, but these inputs will not fully excite the granule cells. Although it will not cause an action potential alone, SuM neurons can have excitatory impact on granule cells with the help of perforant path inputs. The perforant pathway are fibers that connect the entorhinal cortex with the hippocampus. This pathway accounts for the major inputs to the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Ultimately, the SuM will modulate the granule cell outputs causing it to influence the dentate gyrus information processing.

The country emits 7% of global emissions. these figures are quite uncertain, but a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory is within reach. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore air pollution in India, would have health benefits worth 4 to 5 times the cost, which would be the most cost-effective in the world.

Ludwig (1879 1973) was an American percussionist, drum maker, and founder of Ludwig Drums. He helped to create the National Association of Rudimental Drummers and is a member of the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame. Career William Frederick Ludwig was the son of German immigrants to America, arriving when he was just 8 years old in 1887. His father was a professional trombonist and he started taking music lessons upon arriving to Chicago that same year, initially on piano and violin. Ludwig soon switched to drums and became increasingly unhappy with the technology available for drum pedals. Ludwig's first musical gig was at the Wood Brother's Circus in 1895, followed by several other miscellaneous posts.Ludwig, William F. W.F.L Complete Drum Instructor. Revised edition. Chicago: W.F.L. Drum Company, 1942. In 1903 he joined the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. From 1904-1906 he performed with the English Grand Opera Co. and in 1909 he became the timpanist for the Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra and the Pittsburg Symphony. In 1909, with his brother Theobald Ludwig, William set up the Ludwig & Ludwig Drum Company. They manufactured the first modern style bass drum pedal to meet the needs of jazz, ragtime, and circus drummers of the day. Ludwig played with the Chicago- Philadelphia Grand Opera Company from 1910-1912 when he joined the Chicago Civic Opera, a post that would last until 1914. He returned to the Chicago Symphony in 1915 and remained there until 1918 when he resigned to focus on manufacturing. Theobald died in 1918 from influenza, but the Ludwig Company continued to grow with William and was one of the largest drum companies in the world by the 1920s. In 1933, at the American Legion National Convention, Ludwig and a group of 12 other notable rudimental drummers, including George Lawrence Stone, formed the National Association of Rudimental Drummers (NARD) to promote rudimental drumming. They organized a list of 13 essential drum rudiments, later to be followed by another 13 to complete the 26 Standard American Drum Rudiments. These would be the authoritative set of American rudiments until the Percussive Arts Society published another set in 1984. Ludwig's company suffered during the Great Depression so he merged with Conn in 1930 and moved to Indiana. In 1937 he left Conn and founded the WFL Drum Company, which his son William F. Ludwig Jr. and daughter Betty would join in 1938. He published his Collection of Drum Solos featuring the 26 NARD rudiments in 1942,Ludwig, William F. Collection of Drum Solos.

The British and Sambus destroyed the fort after a short sharp fight before destroying the crops and taking away plunder from the surrounding Cacao rich area.Marley p 408Olsen & Shaddle p.762 Events =Background= At the mouth of the R√≠o Matina in the Spanish colonial region of the Captaincy General of Guatemala lay Fuerte de San Fernando de Matina, a wooden blockhouse which had been built by the Spanish in 1741-42. It was garrisoned by thirty four soldiers and twenty local armed militia. Between 1742 and 1747 illegal trade between landowners in Costa Rica and with British Jamaica and the Bayman of the Mosquito coast (of present-day Nicaragua) were stopped as a result of the fort. In April 1747 a group of British baymen and Miskito's took about ten prisoners near Matina and threatened to burn the plantations and invade Cartago if trade was not resumed with them. For this reason the Spanish governor sent a reinforcement of fifty soldiers in the area. The commander of the fort was Don Francisco Rodriguez, and together with the reinforcements ordered to put permanent lookouts in places where they could watch any approaching British troops to avoid surprise.Creedman p 114 =Attack= In early August 1747, 45 British and a troop of \\"Sambo mosquitos\\" commanded by British Captain Thomas Owen was ordered to attack the fort, by order of the English governor of Jamaica Edward Trelawny.Laycock Transported by Pirogues from Jamaica they landed in Moin near Lim√≥n, which beyond had an extensive swamp - the Spanish thinking it was impassable had no lookouts in the area. After beaching the vessels the British were able to advance without being spotted and they walked through the jungle to the fort. The high Canebrake meant they were concealed and watched patiently for five days studying the defences and awaited for the right moment to attack. Finally on 13 August at 11 am the British attacked from the south west, and took the garrison by complete surprise. The soldiers and militiamen had only just prepared a meal which meant that main door of the fort was wide open with only two soldiers guarding the barracks. In addition only four men were guarding the fort walls. When the assault began, only two of those four guards were able to enter before the fort door was closed. The English brought with them two hand grenades each, and used them to bomb the door but they could not break it. They then surrounded and attacked the wall where they fired through the gun holes inside. Quickly the British soon found weaknesses in the perimeter where they could fire their muskets at close range - this caused confusion inside the fort. A little more than fifteen minutes of since the start of the assault, the fort's commander Rodriguez decided he couldn't resist and therefore surrendered. =Aftermath= In total there were four deaths and several wounded among the Spanish. Those who survived were taken prisoner. Subsequently, the British and misquitos ravaged the surrounding area; cocoa farms were looted; cannons, muskets and ammunition were taken. Once this was done the barracks were burned and the fortress was destroyed. They then made a withdrawal to their beached pirogues Moin and sailed without further incident back to Jamaica.Laycock The fort thus failed to stop the attacks by filibusters and with the forts destruction smuggling continued well until Costa Rica's Independence the following century. San Fernando was the first and last stronghold built by the Spanish in the Costa Rican Caribbean and the fort was never rebuilt. The Spanish in retaliation attempted to rout the British and Miskito's from the area but failed repeatedly.

The album is a collection of recordings made by Nilsson in the final years of his life. Background In the early 1990s, Nilsson was ready to return to music after a decade since his last studio album. But after a disastrous meeting with Warner Bros. Records where he was turned down by the label, Nilsson and his then producer Mark Hudson began work by themselves on the then tentatively titled Papa's Got a Brand New Robe album.. Nilsson suffered a heart attack on February 14, 1993. After surviving that, he began pressing his former label, RCA Records, to release a boxed-set retrospective of his career (released in 1995 as Personal Best), and resumed recording, attempting to complete his final album. The first three sentences in this paragraph are taken from https://musiclegends.ca/harry-nilsson-dies-at-52/ Nilsson died of heart failure on January 15, 1994, in his Agoura Hills, California home, at the age of 52.. Before he died, Nilsson did finish the vocal tracks for the album with producer Mark Hudson, who held onto the tapes of that session for nearly 25 years in hopes of finishing the material. Since Nilsson's death, various demos from these sessions appeared on bootlegs over the years. In 2006 Warner/Chappell released a promotional only compilation of Nilsson's music titled Perfect Day - The Songs of Nilsson 1971-1993, which featured versions of the songs \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"U.C.L.A.\\". With the blessing of Harry Nilsson's estate, the album was completed and retitled Losst and Founnd (after a comment Nilsson made after the meeting with Warner Bros. - ‚Äúthey thought I was lost, but I was found‚Äù).

Research  Bowleg's research addresses the psychological development of members of \\"invisible populations\\" in relation to gender and race. She is known for her research regarding intersectionality, stress, and resilience among Black LGB people. Bowleg has studied the effects of social-structural context, masculinity, and resilience on black men‚Äôs sexual HIV risk and protective behaviors. Her work has encouraged the conversation regarding stigmatized topics in the black community such as homosexual behavior as well as emotional well-being. As part of her research, Bowleg interviewed participants on their experiences living in the United States as black men and how their other social identities intersect. Her findings revealed that regardless of socioeconomic statues, disability status, sexual orientation, most of the black male participants described their race as their most salient characteristic. These findings have exposed the need for more research about the strengths and resilience of black gay and bisexual men despite intersectional prejudice and discrimination.

He is best known for his animation work, consisting of flash animation compositions published on his website, Bitey Castle, and on the flash portal Newgrounds. His animation work on the latter has over 16 million views, making him one of the most-viewed artists on the site. Phillips created the fantasy animation shorts series, Brackenwood, the first of which was posted on Newgrounds in March 2004. He was also a featured artist at the Adobe Design Center for the month of December 2006. (Wayback Machine) Life and career Adam Phillips was born and raised in Narromine, New South Wales. According to his mother, he displayed a precocious artistic enthusiasm early in life: > \\"My mother recognized my talent for drawing when I was a toddler, and she > maintains that I could hold a pencil correctly before my two legs could > support me. I would sit on the floor for hours drawing spiders on my fingers > and toes, and filling sheets of butcher's paper with doodles and scribbles.\\" > (Wayback Machine) = Walt Disney Australia = In 1989, Phillips moved to Queensland to find work. He was later injured in an industrial accident, and he dedicated himself to drawing during his convalescence. In 1993, he was hired by Disney to work as a tweener in Sydney and promoted to the position of character animator two years later. He became the effects director in 1998, a role in which he worked on several Disney sequel films. Before Phillips' promotion to the role, the studio did not have an effects department., 18 January 2014, Josiah Brooks (Jazza) at YouTube.com (video), ‚Äì RubberOnion Animation = \\"Transdermal Celebration\\" music video = In 2000, Phillips began his first animations in Flash, focusing on stories he remembered from his childhood. A devoted Ween fan, his flash work soon grew to include an official music video for the band's song \\"Transdermal Celebration\\", as well as a winning entry in the cartoon category of the Flash Forward Film Festival in early 2003. Later that year, Phillips created Bitey of Brackenwood, the second episode in his Brackenwood series and runner up in The Greatest Story Never Told (TGSNT) flash competition.

He has continued to do outside work as a freelance animator, writer and special effects designer for clients such as Kellogg's, BioWare San Francisco and Wizards of the Coast (Dungeons and Dragons). In November 2006, Phillips began a project in which he would produce 10‚Äì20 second animations for every day of the month. The project ended up being featured on the blog section of Wired magazine's official website.Sjoberg, Lore. His Brackenwood animations were also featured on the Wired blog in 2006., Wired Magazine Blogs, 4 May 2006 = Part-time job at EA2D = Phillips was a frequent collaborator with Electronic Arts' BioWare San Francisco studio (formerly EA2D), working as a freelance animator with the studio on three Dragon Age-branded games. His collaboration included creating all of the art and animation for the browser-based Dragon Age Journeys. He set the art style for the Facebook/Google+ game, Dragon Age Legends, as well as animating the opening cinematic and providing concept art for the game's main characters. (Wayback Machine) His art was also used for Dragon Age Legends: Remix 01, a collaboration between BioWare San Francisco and the Flash game developer PixelAnte (also known as Evan Miller). = Cancelled Dashkin video game = In 2008, Phillips released the latest conventional Brackenwood instalment, The Last of the Dashkin, with the intention to either start work on a sequel or to pitch the series as a feature film. However, in 2010 Phillips partnered with programmer and fellow animator Sean McGee to start work on a Brackenwood- branded video game titled Dashkin, which would serve as a sequel to The Last of the Dashkin.Phillips, Adam. , Bitey.com It would be a high-speed side- scroller, all made in Adobe Flash.Phillips, Adam. , Bitey.com While still working as a freelance animator for EA2D in 2011, Phillips showed their progress on the Dashkin game to his colleagues at the studio. Not long after, EA2D was renamed Bioware San Francisco and had begun to search for established 2D IPs on Flash game sites, such as Newgrounds. EA2D asked Phillips if he would be interested for them to work with him on making Dashkin a social game on Facebook, and after discussing it with McGee, he agreed. While initially worried about the game having microtransactions, Phillips reasoned that it could help Brackenwood reach a larger audience. A small team came together, file sharing and version control were put in place, but as Phillips and McGee got to the contract stage, EA2D began to go through some big changes and their boss advised them to take the Dashkin IP back. Not long after, their boss left the company to co-found Rumble Games, and most of the EA2D Phillips had been a part of disbanded after a few months. Phillips and McGee had already begun overhauling Dashkin into a social game but they had no money left and only about 5% of the game completed.Smith, Stephanie. , Cliqist, 31 May 2016Phillips, Adam. , Bitey.com After shopping the IP around to some Flash portals and getting rejected, Phillips and McGee launched a Kickstarter fundraiser to fund the project. They received US$27,333 in donations towards making the game., Kickstarter.com After five years of working together, the two collaborators' schedules would not allow them to continue. Phillips had also found that the limitations of Adobe Flash were hindering the performance of the game considerably, and so the project was cancelled in 2015. = Working on Bob's Burgers = Since May 2014, Phillips has been working as an assistant director on the American animated comedy television series Bob's Burgers. Before becoming assistant director, Phillips did occasional freelance visual effects animation on the show. To this day, working as an assistant director on Bob's Burgers is still Phillips' full-time job. In June 2014, Phillips created an animated GIF of the coach of the Mexican national soccer team, Miguel Herrera, transforming into a Super Saiyan, a concept from the manga and anime Dragon Ball. Using footage of Herrera gesturing wildly and excitedly on a TV broadcast following Mexico's win over Croatia, Phillips superimposed yellow hair, green eyes, glowing aura effects, and lightning on it. It became an Internet meme and the most viral reaction GIF of the World Cup at the time, being viewed over seven million times.

When Phillips finally switched from Toon Animate to the more recent iteration of the software, Toon Boom Harmony, the company behind the software, commissioned Phillips in 2014 to write a guide book to the program titled Animate to Harmony: The Independent Animator's Guide to Toon Boom, which was published on 10 October 2014.Troughton, Caitlin. , Toon Boom's official blog, 25 November 2016 Since collaborating with the company, Phillips has created numerous animation tutorial videos, demonstrations and visual effects files for Toon Boom, many of which are hosted on the company's official website.

(Wayback Machine)Amidi, Amid. , Cartoon Brew 17 January, 12:29 am = Second failed attempt at a Dashkin video game = In March 2017, Phillips announced the full-time development of a new Brackenwood branded game called Dashkin, a revival of the previous Dashkin game project he had been working on with McGee. According to the Dashkin dev blog, it was to be a speed-based side-scrolling platformer built with Unreal Engine 4, and was going to be split into three parts, one of which was to be a story mode that would serve as a direct sequel to Phillips' latest conventional Brackenwood movie, The Last of the Dashkin. He had partnered with Kirk Sexton of Wrong Dojo Inc., who he had met at EA2D when Sexton was working there as a server engineer. Sexton had previous experience with programming for video games, so his role became that of a programmer on the project, while Phillips would be responsible for the majority of the art assets and the story.

It provides free-of-cost tuition to underprivileged children. Almost all the students come from the slums situated adjacent to the Yamuna river and are enrolled in nearby government-run schools. Started in 2006 by grocery shop owner Rajesh Kumar Sharma with just two children, the school now has a strength of more than 300 students. Seven teachers volunteering in their free time help these students to better understand their school curriculum. The school is run in two shifts with a morning shift for boys and an afternoon shift for girls. It has no permanent building and its makeshift campus is situated under a Delhi Metro bridge with pillars serving as its boundary marker and blackboards painted on a wall of Yamuna Bank Metro Depot. It receives no help from either the government or any non-governmental organisation.  History  The school was founded in 2006 by Rajesh Kumar Sharma, a grocery shop owner, for underprivileged children. Originally from the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, Sharma could not complete his Bachelor of Science due to financial reasons. The idea to start a school for children from poor families struck him while he was wandering near the Yamuna River and saw children playing in dust and mud near an under-construction metro bridge. He asked the parents why their children were not attending school, and they expressed their helplessness at being unable to afford their children's education and how there was no school in the neighbourhood. Sharma began the school by teaching two children. He believes that \\"no one should be deprived of education due to poverty and to fulfil his or her dream\\" and devotes more than 50 hours in a week to teaching in the school.  Programme  The school provides free tuition to children already enrolled in nearby public schools, helping them better understand their school curriculum. It tutors students in learning subjects like mathematics, English, Hindi, science, history and geography. Students are encouraged to get enrolled in nearby government-run schools as it provides them opportunity to avail benefits like mid-day meals and free textbooks, among others. Many parents express their reluctance to send their children for tuition, as they need them to either work part-time jobs to support their families, or to take care of their younger siblings at home. Only after extensive persuasion do such parents allow their children to attend the school. Almost all the students come from the slums situated close to the Yamuna river. The school is operated in two separate shifts: the morning batch from 9 a.m. to 11a.m. is for boys and the afternoon batch from 2 p.m. to 4:30p.m. is for girls. More than 300 students of the age group four to fourteen attend the school. Seven teachers besides Sharma volunteer to teach in their free time. Students bring their own textbooks and they are taught in groups.  Campus  The school is situated under a Delhi Metro bridge close to Yamuna Bank metro station in East Delhi. It is a makeshift structure with a metro bridge functioning as overhead roof and bridge pillars serving its boundaries. Five blackboards have been painted on a wall of Yamuna Bank Metro Depot. There are separate toilets for boys and girls in the proximity of school. There are no benches and students sit on scraps of carpet or just the dirt. It receives no help or funding from either the government or any non- governmental organisation (NGO). A few NGOs approached Sharma to associate with the school but he rejected their help because of their lack of commitment towards the goal of the school and their questionable interests. Only non- financial contributions such as packaged food, water bottles, chairs and carpets among others are accepted.

Blackadder became the first female graduate of the University of St Andrews when she gained her M.A. degree on 29 March 1895. She was the first consultant dermatologist to be appointed in 1907 at St. John's Hospital, an appointment which was also notable as one of the first appointments of a woman consultant at a hospital that was not exclusively for women. During World War I, she served as a radiographer at the Scottish Women's Hospital at Royaumont in France and pioneered radiography of gangrene.  Early life  Blackadder was born in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, on 4 December 1875. She was the daughter of Robert Blackadder, an architect and engineer from Dundee. She spent most of her early life around Dundee, living in Bellevue, West Ferry and attending the High School of Dundee.  Education  Blackadder gained her M.A. degree from the University of St Andrews in 1895, becoming the first female graduate of the university. She continued her education at the University of Glasgow where she gained both MBChb (1898) and M.D. (1901). Whilst in Glasgow, she won the first prize in Practical Pathology in 1896 and received First Class Certificates in Materia Medica, Surgery, Midwifery, Ophthalmology and Insanity and a Second Class Certificate in Anatomy.  Career  After graduating, Blackadder moved to London, where she became a consultant in dermatology and electro-therapeutics as well as working in radiography. She became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in 1904 and was appointed as a consultant for St. John's Hospital for Skin Diseases and the South London Hospital for Women and Children. In 1912 Blackadder was one of three doctors who studied the effects of force-feeding on suffragists who went on hunger strikes during their imprisonment, and published medical papers on the subject. During World War I, Blackadder served as a radiographer at the Scottish Women's Hospital at Royaumont, France, returning to her position in London whenever there was a lull in the fighting. She used a state-of-the-art X-ray car which the hospital had been given, and used this to understand and alleviate the effects of gas gangrene through prompt diagnosis and treatment. While serving at Royaumont, Blackadder borrowed a pianola from Paris and installed it at the hospital. She noticed that both patients and staff benefited from playing it and listening to it and she later wrote a book about the importance of music to well-being. The book, Music, Health and Character, was published in 1923. It led to the establishment of the Council for Music in Hospitals. After the war, Blackadder returned to London and continued to practice medicine. She edited her husband's textbook, Savill's System of Clinical Medicine, which she completed in 1942. She also became interested in ancient history and in 1955 she published Alexander the Great and his Times. Blackadder died in London on 12 May 1964. = Legacy = In October 2012 students of the University of St Andrews voted to honour Blackadder by renaming the university's largest hall of residence Agnes Blackadder Hall. The hall is the first student hall at St Andrews to be named after a woman.  Personal life  After graduating, she married Dr. Thomas Dixon Savill at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Forfarshire in 1901; her husband died in 1910.

It will be the second television series based on the comic, following the 2005‚Äì14 TV series that aired on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block for four seasons. This series will premiere in Fall 2020 on HBO Max. Premise The show begins with a black family, the Freemans, settling into the fictional, friendly and overall white suburb of Woodcrest and follows them as they fight the regime of Uncle Ruckus, who rules over the community government. The perspective offered by this mixture of cultures, lifestyles, social classes, stereotypes, viewpoints, and racialized identities provides for much of the series' satire, comedy, and conflict. Development The original Boondocks television series premiered on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim on November 6, 2005 and ran for four seasons and 55 episodes until its conclusion on June 23, 2014. During its first season, McGruder put the strip on a 6-month hiatus beginning in March 2006. He did not return to the strip the following November, and the strip's syndicate, Universal Press Syndicate, announced that it had been canceled. McGruder was not involved in the show's fourth season. Adult Swim stated, \\"a mutually agreeable production schedule could not be determined.\\" On February 6, 2019, McGruder revived the comic strip on Instagram, with the help of former supervising director Seung Eun Kim. A series of one-shots were posted to Charlamagne tha God's Instagram page. On May 29, 2019, voice actor John Witherspoon announced on Joe Rogan's 1305th episode of The Joe Rogan Experience that the series would return. Witherspoon passed away on October 29, 2019, with producers questioning how the show will continue. At Annecy 2019, on June 12, 2019, Sony Pictures Animation announced it would be producing a \\"reimagining\\" of The Boondocks to be co-produced with Sony Pictures Television. On September 18, 2019, it was announced that the reboot had been picked up with a two-season order for WarnerMedia's upcoming streaming service HBO Max. It was also announced that McGruder would be returning as showrunner and will serve as executive producer along with Norm Aladjem for Mainstay Entertainment as well as Seung Kim and Meghann Collins Robertson.

Written by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk and directed by Loni Peristere, it aired on October 23, 2019, on the cable network FX. Plot One year after the events at Camp Redwood, Richter has grown weary of Ramirez's murderous tendencies and alerts the locals to his presence, giving Richter the chance to drive away alone and resulting in Ramirez's arrest. Four years later, the ghosts of Montana and Xavier, still trapped in purgatory on the campgrounds, kill anyone who trespasses, much to the frustration of Ray's ghost and the ghosts of the 1970 counselors. Meanwhile, Margaret has become a rich real estate mogul by renovating infamous murder locations alongside Trevor, who survived her murder attempt. The two entered into a contentious marriage amid Trevor's threat to expose the truth. Margaret chooses Camp Redwood as her next project, to the chagrin of Chet's ghost. A reformed Richter, now with a new name, Donald, and living a quiet life in Alaska with his new wife and son, learns of the project. He returns home one night to find his wife murdered by Ramirez, who broke out of prison with Satan's help. Richter gives his son away and leaves, intent on killing Ramirez. Brooke is seemingly executed for the Camp Redwood murders, but Donna, posing as the executioner, saves her. Reception \\"Episode 100\\" was watched by 1.35 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.6 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Episode 100\\" holds a 92% approval rating, based on 13 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"Though the meandering plot continues to confuse, an intriguing time jump and a host of previous season tie-ins drive this episode home.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"The true story is insane, and rather than embellishing it, the show plays it straight and the end result is funnier than most jokes could have been in that situation.\\" Then, he praised the cast, commenting that \\"Leslie Grossman and Matthew Morrison play out early in the episode feels like one they've had many times before, sort of a Virginia Woolf situation if Elizabeth Taylor's Martha had murdered several people. Leslie Jordan, as always, steals the scenes he shows up in based on costuming alone. [...] John Carroll Lynch continues is criminally underrated actor, putting in good work in a role that won't be appreciated outside of horror circles.\\" Finally, he concluded his review by \\"It takes a few twists to get everyone involved in 1984 back to the place where it all started, but it works. Rich people throwing music festivals was a big deal in the late 1980s, and it's a smart way to get the gang back together despite most of them being dead. Nothing gets people talking like a sequel, and Camp Redwood is ripe for the picking.\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ rating. She enjoyed the different scenes with the ghosts at Camp Redwood, commenting that \\"The ghosts of Camp Redwood are numerous, and fabulous.\\" She also appreciated the evolution of some characters in this episode. The first one being Brooke, as she noted that she \\"traded her [...] virginal innocence for something, uh, else.\\" The second one being Jingles, as she wondered if the character would \\"once again donning his villain's raincoat\\" or if he would become a hero in the last episodes of the season. However, Rosenfield was more critical of Margaret's evolution, commenting that it \\"seems a little clich√©\\". Finally, she really enjoyed the cliffhanger of the episode, with the appearance of Donna, and even more the return of Leslie Jordan for the rest of the season. Variety Andrea Reiher gave a positive review, and said \\"The 1984 season is now on an entirely different timeline and trajectory from the beginning of the season, but the Camp Redwood setting is still integral to the storytelling, so the final four episodes should see everyone congregate back on the campgrounds for some more murderous fun before season's end. \\"Episode 100\\" didn't offer any cameos from quintessential players from American Horror Story past, such as Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson or Jessica Lange, but who knows what may happen in the back half of the season?\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes ","title":"Episode 100 (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"61881252","title":"Joy (Mark Ryder song)"},{"id":"61881277","text":"Laxmi Datt Sharma is an Indian businessman known as the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of Optimise Media Group (India), a UK based Performance Marketing Company, Founder and CEO of Shoogloo and Sirmouri, both Singapore-based Digital Marketing Groups.

Some of the local Catholic faithful believed the incident to be a miracle; however, the skeptic-rationalist author Sanal Edamaruku proved that the water stemmed from a faulty sewage system, which seeped due to capillary action. Edamaruku mocked the Catholic Church on television and called it \\"anti-science\\", and became subsequently subject to multiple first information reports (FIR) under blasphemy laws. A Catholic lawyer and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mumbai called for him to apologise for the comments. After receiving a barrage of threats, he migrated to Finland.  Phenomenon  On 5 March 2012, the feet of a statue of a crucified Jesus in Irla near to the Church of Our Lady of Velankanni (Mumbai) started weeping water and was discovered by a Hindu woman who reported it to the local parish priest; the weeping stopped on 8 March. The parish priest of the church, Augustine Palett, stated \\"whether science can explain what happened or not, a miracle did occur in Irla, namely that of having dozens of Christians, Hindus and Muslims pray together under the cross.\\" On 12 March, Agnelo Gracias, the auxiliary bishop of Mumbai, stated: \\"One can doubt if this has a supernatural cause. I have not seen the cross yet. It is quite possible that water dripping from it may have a natural explanation.\\"  Scientific explanation  The Indian rationalist Sanal Edamaruku was invited to investigate by TV9 of Mumbai with the consent of the church authorities. He went with an engineer to the site where the alleged miracle had happened, and traced the source of the drip to the rear side. Edamaruku found that the water was seeping through the feet because of capillary action and faulty plumbing. Moisture on the wall where the statue was mounted seemed to be coming from an overflowing drain, which was in turn fed by a pipe that issued from a nearby toilet. In a debate on TV9, Bishop Agnelo Gracias from Mumbai said, \\"We will never say it is a miracle. The church will investigate and investigate very carefully.\\" He said it was possible this particular incident had \\"natural causes\\" and agreed that Edamaruku has a \\"right to doubt.\\"  Aftermath  After Edamaruku's televised comments mocking the Catholic Church and the Pope, Catholic Secular Forum filed 17 first information reports against Edamaruku under IPC section 295-A, a blasphemy law of India. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mumbai was not involved with the criminal charges, but issued a statement asking for his apology and for the prosecution to drop the charges. The All India Catholic Union said the law was being applied incorrectly. Colin Gonsalves, the founder of the India Center for Human Rights and Law, stated his opinion that no criminal offence had been committed. There were further complaints that the law was being misused to suppress free speech. Vishal Dadlani and James Randi spoke publicly in support of Edamaruku. On 31 July 2012, Edamaruku left India and settled in Finland. As of 2014, the Catholic Secular Forum were still saying they would call for his prosecution if he returned to India.

History The primary author of SCELBAL is Mark Arnold, who was a high- school student in 1974 when the SCELBI was announced. Arnold was friends with professors at the University of Wyoming (UW), and through them had arranged to have an account on their Sigma 7 mainframe computer. The first version of what became SCELBAL was written for this machine. Later that year, he wrote an 8008 cross compiler on that platform. Arnold entered UW in 1975 and contacted Nat Wadsworth, one of the founders of SCELBI, pitching the idea of a compiled version of BASIC for their new platform. This would be a multi-pass system that would save the intermediate versions on cassette tape. This would be very tedious to use but would produce programs that would run on the 4 kB 8H models of the system. Wadsworth favored an interpreter, which would require 8 kB, which would be available on the new 8B models of the system. The language used floating point routines published by Wadsworth in 1975 in Machine Language Programming for the 8008. It took Wadsworth several months to finally arrange a contract, which included sending Arnold an 8B development system. This significantly delayed the release of the language into 1976. Arnold speculated that, lacking these delays, SCELBAL could have been released at about the same time as Altair BASIC in late 1975. It was first presented in a lengthy article in the second issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal in February 1976. The release of SCLEBAL was announced in an advertisement in Byte's June 1976 issue. The ad did not specifically link the language to the SCELBI platform, instead, it simply offered itself in book form as a complete source listing to create a version of BASIC on any 8008 or 8080 system with the requisite 8 kB of RAM. The book's price was $49, about $ in . Description SCELBAL used a 32-bit (four byte) floating point format for numeric calculations, with a 23-bit mantissa, 1-bit sign for the mantissa, a 7-bit exponent, and 1-bit sign for the exponent. These were organized in reverse order, with the least significant byte of the mantissa in the first byte, followed by the middle and then most significant byte with the sign in the high bit. The exponent came last, again with the sign in the high bit. The manual provides well-documented assembly code for the entire math package, including entry points and usage notes. 32-bit formats were common in this era, while later versions of BASIC, starting with Microsoft BASIC for the MOS 6502, generally adopted a 40-bit (five byte) format for added precision. SCELBAL was otherwise similar to other BASIC dialects, including early MS versions like Altair BASIC, lacking string variables and operators and a number of mathematic functions. Other differences were less pronounced. The statement had an optional form that removed the need for , . It also retained the MS-style short form for the same concept, . SCELBAL also allowed the use of variables for lines, allowing you to, for instance, , which would jump to the line number in variable LL. The base language did not support string handling, although literal (constant) strings could be used in , and had the supporting functions of to print non- printable characters, and to provide layout. Oddly, the system required ASCII codes to have the high-bit set, so to convert from normal ASCII to SCELBI character codes, one had to add or subtract 127. For instance, to produce the string \\"HELLO, WORLD\\" in the output. would normally read the user-entered text as a number, but allowed the dollar sign to indicate the value should be read as the SCELBI code instead. For instance, would read the user input \\"1\\" into A as the floating-point value 1, while would result in A being set to 176, 49 (ASCII for \\"1\\") + 127. Additionally, when the dollar sign is used, the traditional \\"?\\" prompt is not printed, and command returned to the language as soon as a single character is entered, instead of waiting for the carriage return as in the normal case. Among the few other differences was that the command found in MS, which clears out existing program code and data, is called for \\"scratch\\", and the function, which called a machine language routine, was for \\"user defined function\\". did not accept an address or parameters, only a single user-defined zero-parameter function at a fixed location was supported. Error codes were reduced to two letters, and code for and were provided in boilerplate form and expected to be implemented when ported to different platforms. Line numbers could be between 1 and 999999, whereas most BASICs used a 16-bit integer and thus supported lines from 1 to 32767 or 1 to 65535. Language features :Taken from the 1976 manual unless otherwise noted. =Commands= Immediate-mode only Referred to as \\"executive\\" mode in the documentation. scratch, equivalent to MS Immediate or program mode Like MS, could accept multiple variables, . Did not include a prompt string. Like MS, the was optional, so and are equivalent. Alternate form of . It appears the \\"spaced version\\", , was not supported. As in MS, is optional and assumed to be 1. required a variable, unlike later MS versions. Arrays worked as in MS, but were optional and could be turned off to save memory. Only single-dimension arrays were supported, and the total number of elements for all arrays combined was 64 numbers. =Functions= As in MS, takes a dummy variable and returns a value between 0 and 1. Note the lack of the $ found in MS, which uses . Extensions SCHELBI published two extensions to the system, the Mathematical Functions Supplement, and the Strings Supplement. =Math Functions Supplement= The Mathematical Functions Supplement added five new transcendental functions, , , , , and . =String Supplement= The String Supplement was somewhat larger than the Math Functions, including a number of new features. Strings could be up to 80 characters long, and the system could hold a total of 64 string variables. Any one of those 64, or all of them, could be one-dimensional arrays, but the total number still had to be 64 strings in total. Oddly, string arrays did not require a statement. In contrast to MS BASIC, and the Dartmouth BASIC string handling that inspired it, SCELBI used the \\"slicing\\" style of string manipulation found in contemporary BASICs like HP Time-Shared BASIC and Northstar BASIC, or the later Atari BASIC. Instead of using functions like , , to access substrings, the array-access syntax was used with colons separating the starting point and length. As SCELBAL also supported string arrays, the first number in the array accessors was the array index, and was optional if the variable was not an array. So, for instance, the code: would result in \\"ELL\\" being printed to the output. If an array was used the syntax required the array index in the first parameter: would result in \\"ORL\\" being printed to the output. There is a major difference in the way this works in comparison to the other BASICs that used slicing syntax, in that the last parameter is the length, not a position. For instance, in Atari BASIC the similar-looking code: Would instead output \\"EL\\", as the instruction translates to \\"print all characters between positions 2 and 3\\". In this fashion, SCELBAL works in a fashion more similar to MS BASIC, where the equivalent would be: To add full support for strings, the Supplement replaced the original with , which matched the syntax of its MS counterpart. Likewise, was modified so string variables worked like numeric ones, waiting for the carriage return and then assigning the entire user input to the associated string variable. It also added the support functions and , and to convert a string containing a numeric value to a string representation of that number. As in MS, concatenation used the operator.

Early life and education Born Emily Elizabeth Shaw in 1818 in Belfast, Ireland, she was the daughter of Samuel Shaw, a Master Mariner, and Isabella Adelaide McMorran. Her father sailed between Canada and Ireland regularly. She emigrated with her family, including at least two sisters and two brothers, to New Brunswick in 1836. She continued her education there and gained her teacher's licence in King's County on 18 September 1837. She was teaching in Norton at the time. She married Frederick Williams Cadwalleder Beavan on 19 June 1838 in Sussex Vale, Kings County,. Her husband was the local surgeon and teacher and they lived initially in Long Creek, New Brunswick. Later they moved to Mount Auburn, English Settlement. There Beavan contributed stories and poems to the newly established paper, Amaranth. While she didn't use a pen name, she wrote under the common practice of dashing out letters from the name, Mrs B----n or Emily B----n. In 1842 Beavan requested a teacher's licence for Queens County. However, in 1843 the family migrated to England where her husband's father had died allowing her husband to take up his position as surgeon at the Derwent Mines in Blanchland, Northumberland. Her first book, Sketches and tales illustrative of life in the backwoods of New Brunswick, North America, was published while she was living in England in 1845. They did not remain long in England, in 1852 the family moved again to live in Kilmore, Melbourne. There Beavan wrote for Eliza Cook's Journal and various local newspapers. Her husband died in 1867 and Beavan moved to live with her son in Sydney in 1881 where she died on 6 August 1897. While she was buried in an unmarked grave at Rookwood Cemetery, memorial was put on her husband's grave in Kilmore General Cemetery.

Having been a lieutenant colonel at the start of the conflict, he rose through the ranks to major-general and became the deputy commander of the 21st Army, in which he led troops through Berlin. After the war he had to resign from the military due to his health, and despite his long military service as an officer he was never able to return to homeland of Crimea, living in Odessa for the remainder of his life. His brother, Zekery Bulatov, was also not deported in 1944 due to active service in the military, but also could not reside in Crimea after the war and lived in Kattakurgan. Early life Bulatov was born on 28 February 1902 to an impoverished Crimean Tatar family in Yevpatoria. Due to the early death of his father he became the breadwinner of the family while still in school. After completing his initial schooling he attended a rabfak, and moved to Simferopol before entering the military. Upon entering the military he entered a two-year military-political academy in Kazan. He then graduated and was assigned as a company political officer before rising through the ranks to regimental commissar and executive head of the party bureau in the 23rd Rifle Division. From 1933 to 1937 he studied at the Leningrad Military-Political Academy, after which he remained at the academy as a faculty member before becoming commissar of the 39th Rifle Division. Later he was assigned to the 120th Rifle Division. World War II During the initial phase of the defense of the Soviet Union against operation barbarossa, Bulatov was stationed in Orel with the rest of the 120th Rifle Division. From July to August they launched counterattacked as part of the Yelnya Offensive, but after stopping enemy advances the division was transferred to the reserve in September. It soon reemerged as the 6th Guards Rifle Division, having been awarded the guards designation by Red Army leadership for valor in the battle for Yelnya. During the battle, Bulatov always remained on the front line, for which he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and promoted to colonel. Later that year he saw combat in the Oryol-Tula area, to prevent German troops from reaching Moscow. In December he participated in the battle that took back Yefremov from enemy control. Later that winter he was wounded by shell fragments in the head, but remained in combat, taking command of the division after general Konstantin Petrov died from wounds sustained in action. In 1942 Bulatov and general Vyacheslav Tsvetaev were assigned to the 10th Reserve Army, which trained more than 20 divisions that went on to fight on the Stalingrad, Don, and Southwestern Fronts. In December that year the unit was renamed the 5th Shock Army and sent to the Stalingrad Front. Later that month the 5th Shock Army was incorporated into the Southwestern Front, but less than two weeks later it was put in the Southern Front on 3 January 1943. There, the unit fought in the battles for Rostov-on-Don, Donbass, Melitopol, Nikolaev, and Odessa. In March that year Bulatov was promoted to the rank major-general. In June 1944 he was appointed as deputy rear commander of the 10th Guards Army, which was stationed on the Baltic Front. The previous month, his nation had been collectively deported from Crimea to Central Asia, declared \\"enemies of the people\\", and deprived and many civil rights. Since Bulatov was an officer in the Red Army, he was spared deportation in May 1944, but he was still treated like a second-class citizen after the war. In January 1945 he became the deputy rear commander of the 21st Army on the 2nd Belorussian Front, and participated in the battles for Koenigsberg and Berlin. Postwar After the end of the war Bulatov remained in the military until having to retire in January 1946 for health reasons. Despite having been a loyal member of the Red Army throughout the entire war, his Crimean Tatar ethnicity meant that he could not return to his hometown. For the remainder of his life he lived in Odessa, where he was a member of the regional council. After he died on 25 September 1975 he was buried in the Tairovsky cemetery.

History and taxonomy The genus Blastobotrys was incorrectly identified as a hyphomycete and classified within \\"Deuteromyces\\" (Fungi imperfecti) by Klopotek in 1967, with Blastobotrys nivea as the type species. Based on the unique manner, that Blastobotrys displayed dual orders of conidia, von Klopotek concluded, that it must differ from other conidia producing genera like Tritirachium and Rhinocladellia. Then in 1985, the morphological and physiological characteristics of Blastobotrys were defined and distinguished from other closely related species Sporothrix and Trichosporiella, by de Hoog, Rantio- Lehtim√§ki and Smith. As a result, the genus Sporothrix was reserved for anamorphs of Ophiostomatales; and the genus Blastobotrys, for other saccharomycetous yeasts. They had also discovered several new species of fungi, including Blastobotrys elegans and Trichomonascus teleomorphs that related to anamorphs of Blastobotrys. In 1995, after performing D1/D2 analysis, Kurtzman and Robnett reclassified Blastobotrys in the Saccharomycetales order, within the Trichomonascaceae family. They had suspected a strong relation between Blastobotrys species and other anamorphs like Arxula, Candida species and Sympodiomyces. This theory was finally confirmed correct in 2014, by Daniel, Lachance and Kurtzman, through their multilocus sequence analysis on related species of anamophic genera. All species of Arxula and Sympodiomyces and several species of Candida were found to be members of the Trichomonascus clade and were subsequently transferred to the Blastobotrys genus. Kurtzman and Robnett proposed, that since Blastobotrys has taxonomic priority, all anamorphic species of Trichomonascaceae should be assigned to this genus. Similarly, Trichomonascus, the telemorphic state of Blastobotrys, represents the ascosporic genus Trichomonascaceae and takes taxonomic priority over Stephanoascus. Therefore, all teleomorphs of Trichomonascaceae should be assigned to Trichomonascus. Habitat Blastobotrys elegans was first isolated by mycologists de Hoog, Rantio- Lehtim√§ki and Smith in 1985, Finland, from indoor air. Description =Physiology= Blastobotrys elegans exhibits yeast like growth consisting of very dense, outwardly growing hyphae. It is a feminine, anamorphic ascomycete that reproduces asexually, through conidia. It has no known recorded teleomorphic state. Like many Blastobotrys species, B. elegans is characterized by bearing globular primary conidia which synchronously produce distinct, secondary globular conidia. The conidia develop on specialized hyphae called conidiophores, which grow upwards and obliquely. For the most part, budding cells are absent in B. elegans. =Morphology= A strain of B. elegans, labelled CBS 530.83A, was grown at 20-22¬∞C on 4% malt extract/0.5% yeast extract agar and the following traits were observed from its growth. During the early growth phase (after 10 days), several dull white colonies, measuring around 3-5 mm in diameter can be observed. In the later stages of growth, bigger farinose patches begin to appear. They then grow into large, elevated, cerebriform patches. Even as B. elegans growth progresses, it does not emit any noticeable odors. Normally, the species does not usually produce budding cells, however they can form on scattered giant cells. Hyphae are translucent, about 2-3 Œºm wide, grow outwards unevenly and septate every 20-40 Œºm. As cylindrical denticles continue to develop, conidia will form at their apical ends. B. elegans produces primary conidia and secondary conidia, that typically develop simultaneously. Primary conidia are spherical, measure 2.8-4.2 Œºm in diameter and lack setae. Primary conidia are also densely packed with spherical secondary conidia that measure 1.8-3.4 Œºm in diameter and also lack setae. Growth tests All Blastobotrys species, including B. elegans, can grow on cellobiose, D-galactose, D-glucitol, D-glucose, D-mannitol, D-xylose, erythritol, glycerol, ribitol and trehalose. Therefore, when only looking at growth tests, it is very challenging to differentiate B. elegans from other Blastobotrys species. It is worth mentioning, that B. elegans also grows on adenine, arbutin, D-ribose, ethanol, ethylamine, glycine, isobutanol, lactose, n-Hexadecane, maltose, succinate and uric acid. It is unable to grow on D-arabinose, inositol, isoleucine, L-rhamnose, lactate, leucine, melezitose, melibiose, methyl-Œ±-D-glucopyranoside, putrescine, raffinose and sucrose. Other, conditions resulting in negative growth include: on nitrate, at 37¬∞C, without vitamins and in diazonium blue B. =Anaerobic metabolism= Sugars are normally fermented by all Blastobotrys species. Interestingly, B. elegans is the only Blastobotrys species discovered, without the ability to ferment sugar in anaerobic conditions. Subsequently, with the absence of respiration, there is no observed B. elegans growth on D-galactose, D-glucose, D-xylose, lactose, maltose, raffinose, starch and trehalose. It is also unable to ferment insulin. Comparative genomic studies DNA sequencing and BLAST searching were conducted to phylogenetically characterize endosymbiotic yeasts isolated from the guts of basidiocarp-feeding beetles. While it was disclosed, that none of the isolated fungal strains had DNA sequences identical to ones in GenBank; a yeast taxon related to (92% similarity) B. elegans, occurred in 6/22 cloned sequences from the beetle family, Neomida. Further, a yeast taxon related to (91% similarity) Trichomonascus farinosus (originally named Stephanoascus farinosus), occurred in 1/22 clones. In other words, 30% of the clones from Neomida, were discovered to be similar to species of Trichomonascus (teleomorph) and its anamorphic genus Blastobotrys. Two more novel strains of Blastobotrys, very closely related to B. elegans were isolated, and both strains were also found to grow closely with insects. Blastobotrys meliponae is found in the honey of the bee, Melipona scutellaris and Blastobotrys bombycis is found in the gut of the silkworm larva, Bombyx mori. Another comparative DNA sequencing study, found significant nucleotide similarity (<81.7%) between six strains of Trichomonascus ciferrii isolates (obtained from human ear swabs) and other Trichomonascus/Blastobotrys species. Pathogenicity and toxicity While B. elegans appears to be closely related to many pathogenic fungi, it has not been recorded to cause disease or damage in a host.

The SROCC's approved Summary for policymakers (SPM) was released on September 25, 2019. The 1,300-page report by 104 authors and editors representing 36 countries referred to 6,981 publications. The report is the third in the series of three Special Reports in the current Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) cycle, which began in 2015 and will be completed in 2022. The first was the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ¬∞C, while the second was the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL), also known as the \\"Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems\\", which was released on August 7, 2019.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which was endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The AR6 cycle with these three reports, is considered by the IPCC to be their most ambitious since 1988. Main statements =SROCC summary for policymakers (SPM)= In their Summary for Policymakers, the report said that, since 1970, the \\"global ocean has warmed unabated\\" and \\"has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system.\\" The rate of ocean warming has \\"more than doubled\\" since 1993. Marine heatwaves are increasing in intensity and since 1982, they have \\"very likely doubled in frequency\\". Surface acidification has increased as the oceans absorb more CO2. Ocean deoxygenation \\"has occurred from the surface to .\\" =Rising sea levels= Global mean sea levels (GMSL) rose by per year which is \\"2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990\\". At the rate of acceleration, it \\"could reach around to by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced and global warming is limited to well below 2¬∞C, but around to if emissions continue to increase strongly. In their summary of the SROCC, Carbon Brief said that rate of rising sea levels is \\"unprecedented\\" over the past century. Worst-case projections are higher than thought and a rise by 2100 \\"cannot be ruled out\\". if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase strongly.\\" =Ocean deoxygenation= The viability of species is being disrupted throughout the ocean food web due to changes in ocean chemistry. As the ocean warms, mixing between water layers decreases, resulting in less oxygen and nutrients being available for marine life. =Meridional Overturning Circulation in the Atlantic= Chapter 6 which deals with ..., Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) \\"will very likely weaken over the 21st century\\" but it is unlikely that AMOC will collapse. A weakening of AMOC would result in ‚Äúa decrease in marine productivity in the North Atlantic, more winter storms in Europe, a reduction in Sahelian and South Asian summer rainfall, a decrease in the number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic, and an increase in regional sea-level around the Atlantic especially along the northeast coast of North America.\\" Carbon Brief described AMOC as \\"the system of currents in the Atlantic Ocean that brings warm water up to Europe from the tropics. It is driven by the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water ‚Äì the sinking of cold, salty water in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic.\\" =Melting glaciers= There has been an acceleration of glaciers melting in Greenland and Antarctica as well as in mountain glaciers around the world, from 2006 to 2015. This now represents a loss of 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year. =Ice sheets= Carbon Brief said that the melting of Greenland's ice sheets is \\"unprecedented in at least 350 years.\\" The combined melting of Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets has contributed \\"700% more to sea levels\\" than in the 1990s. =Arctic sea ice decline= The Arctic Ocean could be ice free in September \\"one year in three\\" if global warming continues to rise to 2 ¬∞C. Prior to industrialization, it was only \\"once in every hundred years\\". =Global marine animal biomass and fish catch decline= In \\"Chapter 5: Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities\\", the authors warn that marine organisms are being affected by ocean warming with direct impacts on human communities, fisheries, and food production. The Times said that it is likely that there will be a 15% decrease in the number of marine animals and a decrease of 21% to 24% in the \\"catches by fisheries in general\\" by the end of the 21st century because of climate change. =Decline of snow and lake ice cover= In \\"Chapter 3: Polar Regions\\", the authors reported that there has been a decline of snow and lake ice cover. From 1967 to 2018, the extent of snow in June decreased at a rate of \\"13.4 ¬± 5.4% per decade\\". =Thawing permafrost= Future climate-induced changes to permafrost \\"will drive habitat and biome shifts, with associated changes in the ranges and abundance of ecologically-important species.\\" As permafrost soil melts, there is a possibility that carbon will be unleashed. The permafrost soil carbon pool is much \\"larger than carbon stored in plant biomass\\". \\"Expert assessment and laboratory soil incubation studies suggest that substantial quantities of C (tens to hundreds Pg C) could potentially be transferred from the permafrost carbon pool into the atmosphere under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5\\" projection. =Low-Lying Islands And Coasts= In the final section on low-lying islands and coasts (LLIC), the report says that cities and megacities‚Äîincluding New York City, Tokyo, Jakarta, Mumbai, Shanghai, Lagos And Cairo‚Äîare \\"at serious risk from climate- related ocean and cryosphere changes.\\" If emissions remain high, some low- lying islands are likely to become \\"uninhabitable\\" by the end of the 21st century. Reactions The New York Times headlined their September 25 article with 'We're All in Big Trouble'. According to the Times, \\"Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink, and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen.\\" The article cited Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, who was one of the report's lead authors who said that, \\"The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that means we're all in big trouble, too. The changes are accelerating.\\" IPCC Working Group I Co-Chair, Val√©rie Masson-Delmotte, was quoted as saying in Monaco, that \\"Climate change is already irreversible. Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can't go back.\\" The BBC headline referred to a red alert on the Blue Planet. The Economist said that the \\"world's oceans are getting warmer, stormier and more acidic. They are becoming less productive as the ecosystems within them collapse. Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea levels to rise, increasing the risk of inundation and devastation to hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas.\\" PBS NewsHour cited National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Ko Barrett, who is also a vice chair of IPCC, saying, \\"Taken together, these changes show that the world‚Äôs ocean and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature are sweeping and severe.\\" The Atlantic called it a blockbuster report. National Geographic said that according to the report, \\"These challenges are only going to get worse unless countries make lightning- fast moves to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions... But strong, decisive action could still forestall or evade some of the worst impacts.\\" See also *Effects of global warming on oceans Notes References External links * ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** Category:2019 documents Category:2019 in science Category:2019 in the environment Category:Environmental reports Category:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ","title":"Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate"},{"id":"61881700","title":"2019 British Academy Scotland Awards"},{"id":"61881702","text":"Luis Fern√°ndez (born 20 January 1997) is a Spanish slalom canoeist who has competed at the international level since 2014.

Initially published on the internet with 34 signatories from prominent German figures, the document was later turned into a formal petition to the Bundestag. The letter was notable to uniting formerly disparate political tendencies to legitimize right-wing and anti-immigrant sentiment in mainstream German politics. Ideology The publication of Erkl√§rung 2018 on March 15, near the anniversary of the Thirty Years' War, resulted from the emergence of a new far-right intelligentsia in Germany involving the cooperation of multiple social constituencies including moderate conservatives, far-right intellectuals, and former leftists. The text of the declaration is simple and consists of two sentences: Dresden publisher and Erkl√§rung signatory Frank B√∂ckelmann told Die Zeit that he and other Germans feared and wanted to prepare for a future in Germany where some parts of the country would be inhabited by a Muslim majority. One of the unusual features of the Erkl√§rung was its bringing together of formerly disparate political tendencies into a new right wing movement. One of the concepts motivating Erkl√§rung 2018 is the notion that European civilization is in decline and being displaced by foreigners, in particular Muslims or Africans. This concept was explored in a 2018 German novel by Monika Maron called Munin or Chaos in the Head that has become a best-seller in Germany and is a favorite within its far-right intelligentsia. In the book, wealthy and educated inhabitants of Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg lose their belief in Germany culture and through self-hate open Germany to cultural invasion from the Middle East and Africa. While arguments in Erkl√§rung 2018 were marginal in German politics at the time of their publication, they have since become more mainstream. Opposition The declaration was met by protest by the German Writer's Union, stating that Erkl√§rung turned migrants into scapegoats for German insecurities, and that it tended to divide German society. The Erkl√§rung was also opposed by Eva Leipprand of the Augsburg City Council and Green Party, and described in scathing terms by the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. The initial inclusion of Ellen Kositza, wife of far-right news publisher G√∂tz Kubitschek, on the list of prominent signatories attracted negative publicity and led to debates among adherents of Erkl√§rung 2018's cause. Kubitschek is a former member of the German Bundeswehr armed forces and has long been linked with far-right groups in Germany. Signatories Vera Lengsfeld (2009) Vera Lengsfeld, a CDU member and once an East German dissident and a member of the Green Party was a co- initiator of project producing Erkl√§rung 2018. Other signatories to Erkl√§rung include Uwe Tellkamp, SPD member and former banker Thilo Sarrazin, journalist Henryk M. Broder, and far-right figures Karheinz Weissman and Michael Klonovsky. Further prominent signatories include economist Max Otte, journalists Eva Herman and Dieter Stein, chief editor of the conservative magazine CATO Andreas Krause Landt, and publisher of the new right-wing Dresden magazine Tumult Frank B√∂ckelmann. Petition Though initially only signed by academics and prominent figures, the Erkl√§rung became a petition to the German Bundestag. The petition demanded that constitutional control of borders against illegal entry into Germany be restored, and that a commission be created for the submission of proposals allowing the federal government to regain control of the country through migration policy. According to the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, the petition is based upon false premises: that in 2018 mass immigration was occurring into Germany, that this immigration was illegal, and that the German government was encouraging it. Over 65,000 other Germans have signed the document.

Biography Thrall graduated in 1935 with BA from Illinois College and in 1937 with MA and PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois. From 1937 to 1969 he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. In 1969 he became a professor in the newly founded department of Mathematical Sciences (i.e. applied mathematics) at Rice University. He chaired the department from 1969 to 1974. In 1977 he received a joint appointment in Rice's newly established Graduate School of Business, where he taught decision analysis to MBA Students. He retired from Rice University as professor emeritus in 1984. At the beginning of his career, Thrall's research was in group theory, ring theory, and representation theory. His research accomplishments during that period include the celebrated hooklength formula for the dimension of an irreducible representation of a symmetric group, or equivalently the number of standard Young tableaux of a given shape (with J. Sutherland Frame and G. de B. Robinson) and the influential Brauer-Thrall conjectures (with Richard Brauer). For two years, from 1940 to 1942, he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. During WW II he began to study operations research and development of mathematical models for military applications. From 1957 to 1961 he was the editor-in-chief of Management Science, as successor to C. West Churchman. From 1961 to 1965 Thrall was an associate editor for the journal. He was the 16th president of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) (now INFORMS) for a one-year term in 1969‚Äì1970. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. With William W. Cooper, Rajiv Banker, and other collaborators, he wrote a number of important papers on data envelopment analysis (DEA).

He founded an electrical power company in 1922, a telephone company in 1927 and a shipping company operating in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in 1929. He also owned a newspaper, two radio stations and a television broadcaster among other enterprises. He was active in politics, and openly admitted that this was a factor in his business success. After he retired his children took over the business empire, which soon fell apart, with the component companies sold to larger Canadian or American firms. Early years Jules-Andr√© Brillant was born on 30 June 1888 in the Assemetquagan mission near Routhierville on the banks of the Matapedia River. His parents were Joseph Brillant and Rose Ra√Æche. His father was an employee of the Canadian National Railway, and lived in turn in Assametquaghan, Petit-M√©tis and Saint- Octave de M√©tis before settling in Le Bic, his home town. Jules-Andr√© Brillant was baptized at Saint-Octave de M√©tis, where he received his primary education. He studied business, completing his education in New Brunswick. He was educated at St. Joseph's College in New Brunswick. In 1907 Brillant became a junior clerk at the National Bank of Beauceville. A year later he went to open a branch in Matane. In January 1910 he became an accountant and assistant manager at Amqui. He fell ill with a lung disease, spent six months at a sanatorium in Lac-√âdouard, and had to rest for another six months. The local priest in Amqui arranged for him to get a job with the electricity company of the Vall√©e de la Matap√©dia. Brillant was hired on 26 July 1911 to work as a salesman, getting subscriptions to the service. He became a manager, and then secretary-manager in February 1913. Business empire =Power company= Mitis River dam and power plant, c.1927 In 1920 Brillant took a job as manager of the Hochelaga Bank in Rimouski, and moved to that town, which was very poorly supplied with electricity at the time. Brillant came up with a project to provide electricity to the different parts of Bas-Saint-Laurent, using a power plant at the M√©tis River Falls. He managed to get twenty people to each pay $20,000 to meet the price demanded by the owner, Elsie Reford, and obtained a purchase option in 1922. The Compagnie de pouvoir du Bas-Saint- Laurent (Lower St. Lawrence Power Company) was created on 18 July 1922, with Jules-Andr√© Brillant, Joseph Brillant and Paul-√âmile Gagnon as the first directors. The company purchased the Elsie Reford Falls and had a dam built above the falls. On 22 October 1922 the 2.75 MW turbine came into service. It was formally inaugurated in a ceremony on 1 July 1923 attended by various notables. On 27 December 1923, in Chicago, Brillant married Rose-de-Lima Coulombe. He had five children by Rose-de-Lima, who died of diphtheria in September 1933. The Lower St. Lawrence Power Company grew fast through acquisition of small businesses. It became the largest power supplier in the region with a network of transmission lines serving Matane, Mont-Joli, Rimouski and beyond. In 1926 Brillant ran into financial difficulties and lost control of the company to the Central Public Service Corporation of Chicago. In effect the Quebec company was a subsidiary of the Chicago company, but with the same management. During the 1929 economic crisis the Chicago company suffered financially, and gradually the Canadians managed to buy back the Lower St. Lawrence Power Company between 1932 and 1935. The company expanded to supply electricity to the Bas-Saint-Laurent and part of the Gasp√© Peninsula, not without difficulty. Its high rates were denounced by the newspapers in 1937, and the company struggled to meet demand in the 1940s despite adding diesel generators and submarine cables. =Telephone company= Brillant branched out from power into telephone service in 1927. At the time there were several telephone companies, but they had inadequate equipment and offered poor service. A long-distance call might involve the operators of several companies to make the connection, which then had very poor quality. Brillant acquired the main network of the national telephone company, which became the Quebec Telephone and Power Corporation in 1927. The company gradually expanded its network throughout Bas-Saint-Laurent, the Gasp√© Peninsula, Beauce and the Portneuf region. By 1935 the network reached from Trois-Rivi√®res to Matane. The company moved its headquarters from Quebec to Rimouski in 1937. It took the name Corporation de t√©l√©phone de Qu√©bec in 1947, and Qu√©bec T√©l√©phone in 1955. Qu√©bec-T√©l√©phone, later QuebecTel and then TELUS Qu√©bec, was one of Brillant's most important achievements. =Other enterprises= In 1923 Brillant bought Le Progr√®s du Golfe, the only newspaper in the region. In 1929 Brillant bought two shipping companies that he merged to form the Bas-Saint-Laurent Transport Company, which connected to the C√¥te- Nord. At first the company had three ships. Later it acquired more ships and provided service between Rimouski, Matane and all the ports on the C√¥te-Nord. In the early 1930s Brillant became involved in several projects which led to creation of the School of Arts and Crafts in 1936. In 1937 he founded the radio station CJBR-AM, affiliated with Radio Canada. On 1 February 1940, in Miami, Florida, Brillant married Agn√®s Villeneuve, daughter of Henri Villeneuve and Agn√®s Matthieson. Brillant was an organizer of the Liberal Party for Eastern Quebec, and these activities contributed to the success of his businesses, as he admitted himself when he said, \\"faire de la politique, √ßa aide beaucoup pour les affaires\\" (involvement in politics helps a lot in business). Brillant managed to get the government to support creation of an elementary marine engineering school in 1943, and looked after its organization. He was involved in other companies such as the Canadian Cod Liver Oil Company and Rimouski Air Lines. In 1947 Brillant bought the Canada and Gulf Terminal Railway Company, with a line from Mont-Joli to Matane. Last years In 1954 Brillant founded CJBR-DT, and in 1959 inaugurated CJBR- FM, the first private FM radio station in Quebec. His son, Jacques Brillant, managed the CJBR group from 1954 to 1969. In the mid-1950s Brillant began to retire from management of his businesses, and sold most of his assets to his children. In 1962 Brillant handed over the presidency of Qu√©bec T√©l√©phone to his son Jacques. The five children were not as interested in business as their father, and during the 1960s the Brillant empire fell apart. The Bas-Saint- Laurent Power Company was absorbed by Hydro-Qu√©bec in 1963 during the nationalization of electricity. In 1966 GTE took control of Qu√©bec-T√©l√©phone. In 1969 CJBR-AM, CJBR-FM and CJBR-TV were sold to Power Corporation of Canada. Jules-Andr√© Brillant died in Mont-Joli on 11 May 1973, aged 84, and was buried in Rimouski.

In addition he also participated in the later Operation Garlic during the course of which his aircraft sustained significant damage requiring him to bail out. He subsequently evaded capture and successfully returned to the United Kingdom. Biography Frederick Sutherland, known as Fred, was born in the small isolated township of Peace River, Alberta, on February 26, 1923, the son of Frederick Snr. and Clara Caroline (n√©e Richards). Both his parents were in the medical profession, his father a doctor and his mother a nurse. He was the only son of his parents, who in addition had two daughters. It is said that as a youngster his ambition was to be a bush pilot. =Service career= Sutherland joined the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in July 1941. Having undergone his initial training in Canada, he volunteered for the role of air gunner and was subsequently sent to the United Kingdom. He attended No. 7 Air Gunnery School (7 AGS) at RAF Stormy Down following which he was posted to No. 14 Operational Training Unit (14 OTU) at RAF Cottesmore. It was during his time at 14 OTU that he became a member of a crew commanded by Les Knight, which saw them converting onto the Vickers Wellington, and subsequently the Avro Manchester. During one particular sortie on the Manchester, both the aircraft's engines failed forcing Knight to make an emergency landing. The numerous operational issues with the Manchester saw it retired quickly from front line operations, subsequently being replaced in part by the Avro Lancaster. Knight's crew converted onto the Lancaster in September 1942, following which they were posted to 50 Squadron (50 Sqn) at RAF Waddington. During his time with 50 Sqn, Sutherland flew 25 operations which saw them carrying out a wide variety of raids on such targets as Hamburg, Essen and Stuttgart as well as crossing the Alps in order to carry out a raid on Turin. Operation Chastise In March 1943, Les Knight was selected for the new Squadron X - subsequently renamed No. 617 Squadron (617 Sqn) - which formed at RAF Scampton, and Sutherland along with the rest of Knight's crew volunteered to accompany him. Following a period of intensive training the crew participated on the raid against the Rhur Dams on the night of May 16/17, 1943. Numerous decorations were bestowed on various members of 617 Sqn following Operation Chastise, however Sutherland was not officially recognised for his part in the raid. This decision not to reward the entire complement of his crew was said to have weighed heavily on Knight, who had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order. Operation Garlic & evasion Sutherland's final mission as part of 617 Sqn was on the night of September 15/16, 1943, when he took part in the raid on the Dortmund-Ems Canal. Code-named Operation Garlic, the raid was tasked with severing a vital stretch of the canal to let water out onto the flatter lower plains, and as had been the case with the earlier Rhur dams raid, the sortie required precision low flying to be carried out by the squadron. As a consequence of striking the tops of some trees, Knight's aircraft sustained damage to the radiators of its port engines which subsequently had to be shut down, following which Knight jettisoned his bomb. Despite the limitations of performance, Knight managed to climb his aircraft to and was able to fly over the Dutch border before ordering his crew to bail out. Once his crew had successfully left the aircraft Knight attempted a forced landing, however on impact with the ground the aircraft blew up and he was subsequently killed. Having bailed out, Sutherland landed in a field near the town of Zwolle and met up with his navigator, Sydney Hobday. Both men subsequently made contact with members of the Dutch Resistance. Issued with false papers stating he was a labourer working on the fortifications of Cherbourg, Sutherland was able to make his way to Paris from where he was subsequently passed down the Chemin de la Libert√© escape route to Spain and on to Gibraltar. Following two months of evasion Sutherland arrived back in the United Kingdom on December 6, 1943. Subsequent service As a consequence of having transferred through various components of an evasion line, Sutherland was barred from undertaking any further operations (no airman who had evaded capture was again permitted to fly over occupied Europe for security reasons) and he returned to Canada at the end of 1943. He served out the rest of his time in the RCAF as a gunnery instructor and concluded his service in 1944. =Personal life= Sutherland married Margaret Baker, the day after he returned to Canada on January 4, 1944. The marriage produced three children. He took employment as a clerk and completed his high school education by attending night classes. He gained a degree in forestry, graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1957 following which he worked for the Alberta Forest Service. His work saw him taking postings in Edmonton, Blairmore and Calgary before the family settled in Rocky Mountain House in 1964 where he became Superintendent of the Rocky Clearwater Forest, from which he retired in 1986. He returned to Europe in 2010, and met up with some of the people who had been part of the Chemin de la Libert√© evasion line and who had assisted him in his escape. =Death= Fred Sutherland passed away at the Rocky Mountain House General Hospital on January 21, 2019. He was predeceased by his wife in 2017, and was survived by his three children (two sons and a daughter). His funeral took place on January 29. Following the death of Fred Sutherland, George \\"Johnny\\" Johnson became the last survivor of Operation Chastise.

Services at Siloah were conducted in the Welsh language. The chapel was established in 1841 at a time when Llanelli Docks were rapidly expanding and industrial development was being driven apace by entrepreneurs such as the Nevill family. David Rees of Capel Als was the driving force behind the new cause. Siloah was consecrated on 14 January 1841 with 116 members leaving Capel All to form the new congregation David Rees acted as minister of the new church for the first year. The ministry of Thomas Rees, 1842-49 Siloah's first full-time minister, Thomas Rees, came to Llanelli after a brief ministry at Ebenezer, Trecynon, Aberdare. Rees was installed at services held on 26 and 27 July 1842 although he had commenced his ministry on 15 March. A native of Llanfynydd in rural Carmarthenshire, Thomas Rees had spent time as a miner before entering the ministry. Later, he became a prominent figure within his denomination, served on two occasions as president of the Union of Welsh Independents, and he made a notable contribution to the history of Congregationalism in Wales. Huw Edwards suggests that there was some disquiet at Siloah over his absences in London during his ministry, pursuing his political and literary interests. In 1849, Rees moved to Beaufort, Ebbw Vale and he was succeeded by David Davies, a student from Brecon Theological College, who was ordained on 3 October 1849. However, his ministry lasted for only three years. The ministry of Thomas Davies, 1854-98 Thomas Davies, born in Carmarthenshire but who began preaching at Bethania, Dowlais came to Siloah in 1854 when the church had 194 members. By 1872 this figure increased to 409 and to 490 by 1891. It was enlarged in 1855 to the design of architect Thomas Thomas of Landore. During his long ministry at Siloah, Davies built up a strong following, which was reflected in the tributes which appears after his death. Huw Edwards declares that \\"even by the proposteraous standards of the time, they are impossibly inflated.\\" Edwards presents him as a controversial figure who at times reveled in confrontation, whether, disrupting a Unitarian meeting which he considered inappropriate worship, campaigning against alcohol, or opposing Sunday burials. The same pattern can be seen in some of his political activities. Davies played a prominent role during the 1868 General Election, and was one of many nonconformist ministers who frequently spoke in favour of liberal candidates in both the Carmarthen county and borough constituencies. At Llanelli, Davies openly challenged Conservative candidate Henry Puxley at a disorderly meeting. Following Puxley;s departure, Davies together with other nonconformist ministers from the town, mounted the platform and passed a motion of confidence in the Liberal candidate. Like many Victorian nonconformist ministers, Davies was awarded a doctorate in theology; in his case by Iowa College in the United States. Edwards speculates that this was probably an honorary degree but also suggests that it may have been awarded for some academic research given Davies's interest in scientific subjects. When he was elevated to the presidency of the Union of Welsh Independents in 1880, his address was on the \\"theological and scientific stirrings\\" of the age. Welcomed by some observers, Dr John Thomas of Liverpool considered it unworthy of a presidential address. The climax of Davies's ministry was probably the series of meetings in May 1891 to mark the 50th anniversary of the church, which were reported to have attracted large crowds. The celebratory services were arranged, in part, to clear the chapel's debts. Twentieth century The next minister was Elias Davies, who was killed in an accident in 1908. Over two thousand people attended his funeral. Later ministers were D. Huws Jones (1917‚Äì52), Wilfred Price (1954‚Äì69), Gwyn Rhys (1972‚Äì77) and D. Luther Owen (1978‚Äì83). After years of decline, Siloah closed in 2005.

The subsequent murder trial, newspaper coverage and fictional accounts of her life and death generated debate on a range of issues related to women and women's lifestyles.  Biography  Caswell and her two sisters, Ruth and Thais, left their hometown of Brompton, Quebec to work in the textile mills of New England. They first went to Lowell, Massachusetts, and then Manchester, New Hampshire. While working at the Amoskeag Mill in Manchester, Caswell met William Long, a factory machinist and the pair became lovers. In September 1849 Long lost his job and moved home to Biddeford, Maine. A week after he left Manchester, Caswell left for Salem, Massachusetts. In November 1849, Caswell suspected that she was pregnant and left Salem and headed for Biddeford to find Long. She told him privately of her suspected pregnancy and they decided that abortion was their best option. Neither Caswell nor Long knew whom to ask for an abortion, so Long turned to his boss Mr. Blake, who found Dr. James Smith, who was known as a botanical physician. Smith gave Caswell the alias name Mary Bean, and Caswell moved into Smith's house while he attempted to terminate the pregnancy. Caswell began taking abortifacients, an agent or drug that will induce an abortion. Caswell took the extracts at the end of November and again early in December, but the abortion was unsuccessful. On December 15, 1849, when Caswell was fifteen to eighteen weeks pregnant, Smith took more drastic and dangerous measures to terminate the pregnancy. To perform the abortion, Smith inserted an eight-inch long hooked wire instrument, into Caswell's vagina and into her womb while she was producing very intense contractions. Smith's plan was to puncture the amniotic sack and terminate her pregnancy. Smith was successful in aborting the fetus but during the procedure he pierced her uterus and damaged the surrounding organs, leaving a wound a quarter-inch in diameter and four inches in length. The gash quickly became infected and at the time, there was no anesthesia, antibiotics, antiseptics, or analgesics. In intense pain from the procedure, Caswell was struck with fever, chills, and spreading infection. Smith had little or nothing to offer her for her pain. A week after the abortion, as Smith knew Caswell's life was coming to an end, he left the house and slept at a nearby parlor. She died in Smith's house on December 22, 1849. When Long went to visit Caswell, as he did every Sunday, Smith told Long that Caswell had died from typhoid. Smith approached Long again in January asking him for more money, as well as Caswell's trunk, which she had left at her boarding house before the procedure. Smith refused; in response, Smith angrily told Long that Caswell did not die from typhoid, but instead she had died in childbirth and delivered an undeveloped son. = Death and murder trial = Following Caswell's death, Smith took a wooden board from his barn and tied her corpse to it, then disposed of her body in the nearby Woodbury Brook, off the Saco River. Caswell's body was making its way to the Atlantic Ocean when it got lodged in a culvert. Her corpse remained there until April 13, 1850, when her body was discovered by Saco residents cleaning up the area. Nobody knew the identity of the woman, as she used the fake name Mary Bean when she sought out an abortion. During the examination of the body, the coroner concluded that because of the intensive trauma to her reproductive organs, the infection she had was a result of an abortion, This detail was barely mentioned in Smith's trial that soon followed, as it was improper to talk about abortion during this time period. However, the state of her body was discussed: rotted and decayed after a cold Maine winter. It was discovered that Smith burned Caswell's belongings, including her leather chest, which he attempted to disguise as his own by carving his name into it. He also burned his medical instruments that he had used to perform her abortion. On April 15, a constable searched Smith's house and found the remnants of him trying to cover up Caswell's presence in his home. Smith became a suspect in the case because of the location where the body was found, and someone recognized the board in which her body was tied to as being from his shed. On April 17, he was arrested and charged with the murder of Berengera Caswell. The jury and constable had decided that he was guilty, but they just weren't sure which action did it. Some of these actions included: strangulation, administration of savin, a mortal wound with a wire instrument, a mortal wound with an unknown instrument, or by some manner as yet unknown. A descriptive account of her autopsy was given, and it was proven that her death was caused by inflammation and internal infection from the faulty abortion. They stated that Smith's claim of death from typhoid was far from the cause of her death and it was his illegitimate medicinal practices instead. Women were used as witnesses to prove that Caswell had gone to Smith for an abortion. What tied Caswell to Smith were her memorable earrings. Everyone who testified seemed to remember her because of her drop earrings. Not only was Smith on trial, but Caswell's actions were also brought up to be scrutinized, such as her abundance of clothing and the earrings that were previously mentioned. They ridiculed her actions, and she became a lesson for other girls on what not to be. One of the big lessons for other young girls that came from this trial was to not seek such independence, and of course the lesson of avoiding premarital sex. All of the evidence combined was enough for the jury to determine that Smith murdered Caswell. He was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Newspaper coverage on this case was huge, with coverage throughout New England. In May of the next year, Nathan Clifford, Smith's attorney, appealed Smith's case to the Maine Supreme Court, arguing that his charge should not be murder, but rather manslaughter. After reviewing the appeal for nearly a year, the Supreme Court decided that Smith had been improperly charged. The murder charge was overturned, and he had already spent enough time in prison to serve a manslaughter charge, so he was set free. During this time, Caswell's actions were also brought up to be scrutinized. Some of the key reasons they ridiculed her were things such as her abundance of clothing and the earrings that were previously mentioned. These actions were not approved of because her abundance of clothing meant that she was spending frivolously. The reason that these young girls were allowed to work in the factory was under the assumption that they would send their earnings back home to financially support their families. Instead, Caswell was enjoying her financial independence, much like many other young factory girls. Her earrings also suggested something about her morals because during this time, reputable women did not wear such things. In turn, these assumptions implied that she was responsible for her fate. She became a lesson for other girls on what not to be. The big lessons for other young girls that came from this trial was to not seek for such independence and be good daughters, and of course the lesson of avoiding premarital sex.  Legacy  Berengera Caswell's legacy lived on as the story of Mary Bean, the pseudonym Smith had given her. Eventually, her actual name was dropped altogether by the public as the case stopped being a hot topic, and her story became free range for any authors seeking to add a spin to her tale or use it to their advantage. Mary Bean became a cautionary tale for women of mature age whose early death was used to warn women of the consequences of having premarital sex. Her story was posted in newspaper articles, published in books, and communicated via word of mouth. The newspaper and book publications of Caswell's actions leading to her death, as well as the details and outcome of her murder trial were used to scare women into conforming to what was seen as the correct way to behave. After the trial, which left many citizens of Saco feeling that Caswell's death had gone unavenged, sensational fiction stories emerged. The two most famous pieces of fiction written about the case were Mary Bean, The Factory Girl and Life of George Hamilton. These \\"true crime\\" short stories were loosely based on the true events of the murder of Berengera Caswell, but were highly dramatized and moralized to capture public interest. In these works of fiction, Caswell's name was replaced with her alias Mary Bean, and William Long was framed as a dastardly villain called George Hamilton. The authors- \\"Miss J.A.B- resident of Manchester\\" and \\"Reverend Mr. Miller\\" -also combined the details of the Caswell case with other murders across New England, further villainizing the \\"evil seducer George Hamilton\\" in the public's eye. These stories transformed the Smith case into stereotypical works of sensational fiction. Mary Bean, The Factory Girl tells a tale loosely based on Caswell's life. In this story, a beautiful but naive Mary Bean leaves her soon to be husband, William Churchill, for the seductive George Hamilton, who effectively ruins all aspects of her life. Hamilton takes her away from her home in Canada, impregnates her, attempts to abandon her, murders an innocent tax collector, and then has Mary's pregnancy terminated, which, in the end, takes her life. It's a classic tale of a young woman being taken advantage of- a narrative extremely common in the nineteenth century. This tale was written by an author known only as \\"Miss J.A.B\\" who aimed to warn others of what could potentially happen to young factory girls. Life of George Hamilton continues the story told in Mary Bean, The Factory Girl, but focuses more on George Hamilton's fate after murdering Mary Bean. It was written by Reverend Mr. Miller, who was inspired to continue the story told by Miss J.A.B. In this tale, Hamilton frames his brother for the death of Bean, but ultimately has his plot foiled when Bean's doctor confesses to the crime. Ultimately, Hamilton and the rest of his evil posse end up deceased or in jail, providing further closure to the Mary Bean tale. Both of these stories were well received by Saco residents. They provided closure to the confusing and worrying death of Caswell by using a familiar fictional template. They also helped to bring the attention of the public back to the case as the trial waged on.

In the 1920s, while in exile in Paris, Prince Carol hired Dumitrescu as his private secretary. The latter was a law student at the University of Paris; his father, general Constantin Dumitrescu, was in charge of military recruitment at Constan»õa. Wily and well informed, Puiu quickly earned the prince's confidence. He was convinced that the royal was being persecuted by the old political guard for his modernizing ideas. He sought to rally a large number of politicians and businessmen around his boss, promising rewarding positions at the heights of state and economy. This was the nucleus of an emerging royal camarilla.Scurtu, p. 14 Retained after Carol took the throne in 1930, Dumitrescu ended up the second-ranked figure in the camarilla, behind royal mistress Elena Lupescu. He received and send correspondence, and was the king's spokesman in his relations with politicians. An unscrupulous figure, he did not hesitate to obtain from Carol an appointment for his father as inspector general of the Romanian Gendarmerie.Scurtu, p. 108 An admirer of the Iron Guard, in mid-1933 he successfully advised the king not to dissolve the fascist movement by royal decree, as proposed by foreign minister Nicolae Titulescu.Puiu Dumitru Bordeiu, Mi»ôcarea LegionarƒÉ √Æn Dobrogea √Æntre 1933-1941, p. 51. Constan»õa: Editura Ex Ponto, 2003, Dumitrescu's position had become untenable by early 1934. His ambivalent attitude to the assassination of Ion G. Duca and his relations with the Guard convinced the king to heed the request of Lupescu and fire Dumitrescu. Having reached a dizzying level of power and convinced that he was unassailable, the secretary had begun to believe that anything was permitted him. He even told the king that Lupescu, due to her luxurious lifestyle and haughty attitude, was creating a bad image domestically and abroad, and should be sent outside the country for a longer period of time. Moreover, the royal mistress had turned against Dumitrescu in the summer of 1933, when he began an affair with the widow Ella Manu. While Lupescu was on good terms with Dumitrescu's wife Jenny, she feared Manu. Moreover, the king came under pressure from his new prime minister, Titulescu, to fire his secretary.Scurtu, p. 170 Thus, in March 1934, Carol dismissed Dumitrescu, asking him to leave Romania. He settled in France, where he avoided politics altogether. All his subsequent efforts to re-enter the king's good graces, including groveling missives, came to nought. In May 1935, Dumitrescu's father was sent to prison for corruption offenses, dying shortly thereafter. His son's request for an autopsy was denied, leading to rumors of poisoning.Scurtu, p. 171 Notes References *Ioan Scurtu, Istoria rom√¢nilor √Æn timpul celor patru regi (1866-1947).

It was designed by George Drysdale and built in 1933‚Äì34. The church has been a Grade II listed building since 2009. Historic England consider it a \\"good example\\" of a church of its period, which \\"embodies the late flowering of Arts and Crafts principles with [the] Romanesque style\\". They praised the \\"accomplished and distinctive design\\" and display of \\"high standard craftsmanship\\". History The first Roman Catholic church to be built in Weymouth followed the passing of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. Although priests had ministered in the town beforehand, the passing of the act saw Fr. Peter Hartley appointed to the town. He purchased a suitable plot of land in Dorchester Road and had St Augustine's Church built there, which opened on 22 October 1835. By the 1920s, St Augustine's was too small to accommodate the local congregation, particularly during the peak season when holidaymakers and visitors often resulted in overcrowded services at the church. Furthermore, Weymouth's priest at the time, Fr. Jules Ketele, felt Weymouth would be adequately served by a new church in a more central location. A committee was formed in 1925 and fundraising carried out over the following years. A plot of land at Stavordale Road was purchased at the beginning of 1932 and plans for the church drawn up by Mr. George Drysdale of London. The building contract was awarded to Mr. William Lacey of Hounslow and the foundation stone laid by the Bishop of Plymouth, Rev. Dr. John Barrett, on 3 May 1933. The church was opened by Bishop Barrett on 18 April 1934. Both the church and its presbytery were constructed at a cost of over ¬£9,000, and with their opening, St Augustine's became a chapel of ease to St Joseph's. A shrine representing the Lourdes grotto was dedicated in the grounds of the church in 1949. It was erected by Fr. Ketele following his pledge to do so if the church escaped air raid damage during World War II. It also acted as a war memorial and contains a tablet listing the local Catholic men who lost their lives during the conflict. A parish hall was opened behind the church in 1951, which was designed by Mr. G. C. Wilkins and built by Messrs A. E. Whettham and Son. Architecture St Joseph's is built of painted brick, with dressings in cast concrete and limestone, and roofing of Cornish slate. It was designed to accommodate 300 persons, and is made up of a narthex, nave, north and south aisles, clerestory, chancel, organ/choir gallery, baptistery, linked sacristy and attached presbytery. A large bell turret sits on the gable above the main entrance. The interior contains plastered walls, parquet flooring and pine pews. The church's temporary altar was replaced by a marble one in 1937 and its original organ was replaced in 1948.

The top is made up of a spindle, which is usually wooden, and ends in a metal point and a cord used to toss it.Francesco De Bourcard (1853) Uses and customs of Naples and described and painted designs, G.

Once the string is wound around the top, the child holds the end and puts the top in the palm of their hand. Then, with a quick movement of the wrist, he or she opens his or her hand and throws the top to the ground, still holding onto the string. This makes the top spin quickly on its metal handle. The point is clearly to make the top spin for the longest amount of time possible, and the game can be played alone or as a competition between more children.

The Order attracted many writers and artists and began the Neo-Jacobite Revival that flourished in the 1890s. The Order closed during the First World War, but in 1926 the Royal Stuart Society was formed to carry on its ideal and mission. History Jacobites support restoration of the House of Stuart to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Following the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745, Jacobitism was rigorously suppressed, and Jacobite sympathisers had to form secret clubs and societies to discus their ideas in private. One prominent example was the \\"Cycle of the White Rose\\" usually known as the Cycle Club, which had been founded in 1710 by the Williams-Wynn family in North Wales. The Cycle Club continued to meet under the family's patronage until the 1860s. =Formation= In 1886, Bertram Ashburnham circulated a leaflet seeking Jacobite sympathisers, and amongst those who replied was Melville Henry Massue. Together they formed the Order of the White Rose, a Jacobite group that was the spiritual successor to the Cycle Club. The Order was officially started on June 10, 1866. The Order was influenced by the Oxford Movement of the 1830s and 1840s which promoted Anglo-Catholicism and held up Charles I as a martyr. The Order attracted Irish and Scottish Nationalists to its ranks. While these various interests gathered under the banner of restoring the House of Stuart, they also had a common streak against the scientific and secular democratic norms of the time. Some even planned (but did not execute) a military overthrow of the Hanoverian monarchy, with the aim of putting Princess Maria Theresa on the British throne. =Neo-Jacobite revival= The 1889 Exhibition organized by the Order In 1889, the New Gallery in London put on a major exhibition of works related to the House of Stuart, organized by Henry Jenner. Ashburnham - the president of the gallery - persuaded Queen Victoria to lend a number of items to the exhibition, as did the wife of her son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and families with Jacobite sympathies and pasts from England and Scotland donated items. The exhibition was a significant popular success and revived public interest in the House of Stuart generally, and Jacobitism specifically. The Order of the White Rose was largely a romantic and sentimental organisation, focused on a nostalgic vision of a Jacobite past. It attracted artists and writers to its ranks, including Frederick Lee, Henry Jenner, Kitty Lee Jenner, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Robert Edward Francillon, Charles Augustus Howell, Stuart Richard Erskine, Andrew Lang and Herbert Vivian. The order published its own paper The Royalist from 1890 to 1903. The popularity of the exhibition sparked a renewed interest in the political ideals of the Jacobite cause, especially amongst monarchists and Anglo-Catholics. Immediately following the exhibition, new Jacobite groups began to form. In 1890, Vivian and Erskine co-founded a weekly newspaper, The Whirlwind that espoused a Jacobite political view. Ashburnham was not a proponent of the political side of the movement, and in 1891 The Order of the White Rose split, when Vivian, Erskine and Melville Henry Massue formed the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland. Vivian and Massue were leading members of the neo-Jacobite revival, while Erskine soon focused his political endeavours on the related cause of Scottish Nationalism. The League was a \\"publicist for Jacobitism on a scale unwitnessed since the Eighteenth Century\\". Several other Jacobite and Legitimist societies formed in the early 1890s, and though serious in intent, they were widely greeted with amusement and disdain. The Order was the leading society for the artistic and historical side of Jacobitism. Art dealer Charles Augustus Howell and journalist Sebastian Evans were members of the Order, while poets W. B. Yeats and Andrew Lang were drawn to the cause. By 1910 it had inspired a branch in North America. =Closure= In 1914, just after the start of the First World War, Prince Rupprecht ‚Äì the legitimate king of England, Ireland and Scotland according to the Jacobite Succession ‚Äì appeared in German uniform in support of The Kaiser. Public sympathy immediately turned against the Neo-Jacobites, many supporters left, and the Order was quickly closed.

Baldwin's research has been funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Science Foundation, and National Institutes of Health.  Research  Baldwin's primary research interest is related to how infant and young children acquire knowledge. Her current studies look at how infants understand human motion in relation to intentions and goals, and early language learning. She is the principal investigator at the Acquiring Minds Lab of the University of Oregon. One of Baldwin's studies demonstrate that infants can readily detect disruptions in the structure of inherent intentional actions and then analyze the continuous action with respect to the structure. Baldwin and her colleagues suggest that the infant's ability to parse together behavior and structure is a prerequisite to understanding intentions.  Representative publications  * Baldwin, D. A.

Born in Rhode Island, the most Catholic state in the United States, Freitas's Catholic religion and spirituality inform much of her writing. Her writing also addresses sexuality, consent, and college campus culture.  Early life and education  Freitas was a gymnast for 7 years, but at age fifteen she retired because of injuries. She received a B.A. in philosophy and Spanish from Georgetown University. She received her Ph.D. in religion from Catholic University of America.  Career  = Academic institution positions = Freitas taught at Boston University in the Department of Religion and Hofstra University in the Honors College.

Freitas currently serves as a research affiliate at the University of Notre Dame's Center for the Study of Religion and Society. = Writing = Sex & the Soul: Juggling Sexuality, Spirituality, Romance, and Religion on America's College Campuses (2008) addresses the connections between sexuality and spirituality/religion at seven United States universities and colleges, including non-religious public, secular private, Catholic private, and evangelical private institutions. Her research included an online survey, with more than 2,500 responses, as well as interviews. One hundred and eleven students were interviewed: 48 men and 63 women. Freitas concluded that the largest conflicts between sexuality and spirituality were between evangelical and non-evangelical institutions, rather than religious and non-religious ones. Freitas argued that students enrolled in Catholic institutions responded in a similar way as those at non-religious institutions. Overall, students did not find that their sexuality and spirituality/religion informed each other very much. On the other hand, Freitas discovered that students in evangelical institutions made conscious efforts to reconcile their sexuality with their spirituality/religion perhaps because they more often self-identified as religious and spiritual. Sex & the Soul is the first major study investigating young people's attempts at reconciling spirituality and sexuality. Freitas called for real-life solutions to these conflicts. Consent on Campus: A Manifesto (2018) explored the widespread problem of sexual assault and sexual violence on college campuses. Freitas argues that this problem is because of both the widespread failure of colleges and universities to educate students about sex and consent and \\"hookup culture.\\" Freitas aimed to provide a more complete education about consent and proposed ways to have more constructive conversations. Freitas argued that consensual sex must be communicative. Consent: A Memoir of Unwanted Attention (2019) explained the personal dimensions of Freitas's work with consent on college campuses. In the 1990s at the Catholic University of America, a professor and priest (\\"Father L\\") harassed Freitas.

As a two-year-old in 2018 he showed top class form to win two of his three races including the Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte. In the following year he developed into a leading sprinter, winning the Sandy Lane Stakes and running third in the Commonwealth Cup before recording his first Group 1 success in the Haydock Sprint Cup. As a four-year-old in 2020 he won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes. Background Hello Youmzain is a bay colt bred in France by Rabbah Bloodstock. He raced in the colours of Jaber Abdullah, one of Rabbah Bloodstock's major partners. He was sent into training with Kevin Ryan at Hambleton, North Yorkshire. He was named after, but unrelated to, Jaber Abdullah's best horse Youmzain. He was sired by Kodiac, a sprinter who won four minor races from twenty starts and finished second in the Hackwood Stakes and fourth in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. He became a very successful breeding stallion, siring many major winners including Tiggy Wiggy, Fairyland and Best Solution. Hello Youmzain's dam Spasha never raced but was a successful broodmare whose other foals included the Gran Criterium winner Royal Youmzain. She was a granddaughter of Sandy Island who won the Lancashire Oaks and was a half-sister to Slip Anchor. Racing career =2018: two- year-old season= Hello Youmzain was ridden in all of his races as a two- year-old by Kevin Stott. On 22 August at Carlisle Racecourse the colt started 9/4 favourite for a six-furlong maiden race and made a successful debut as he took the lead a furlong out and drew away to win by four lengths. Fifteen days later he ran in a novice race (for horses with no more than two previous wins) over the same distance at Haydock Park and ran second to the Roger Varian trained San Donato, beaten a short head by the winner. On 13 October the colt was sent to France and stepped up in class to contest the Group 2 Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte over 1200 metres on soft ground and started the 6.4/1 fifth choice in an eight-runner field with his more fancied rivals being Sporting Chance (winner of the Prix Eclipse), Legends of War (second in the Gimcrack Stakes), Queen of Bermuda (Firth of Clyde Stakes) and Graignes. After tracking the leaders, Hello Youmzain went to the front 200 metres from the finish and despite hanging to the left he kept on well to win by two and a half lengths from Queen of Bermuda. Kevin Stott commented \\"He's still a big baby and as you could see, as soon as I hit the front he wanted to go left. I'm really looking forward to riding him next year and think he could be a very good horse\\". In the official 2018 European classification for two-year-olds Hello Youmzain was given a rating of 114, making him the tenth best juvenile colt, 12 pounds behind the top-rated Too Darn Hot. =2019: three-year-old season= James Doyle took the ride when Hello Youmzain began his second season in the Greenham Stakes, a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas, run over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 13 April. He started the 5/2 favourite but was unable to quicken in the closing stages and came home fourth of the eight runners behind Mohaather, Great Scot and Urban Icon. On 25 May the colt was dropped back in distance for the six-furlong Sandy Lane Stakes at Haydock and went off the 5/1 second favourite behind the undefeated Calyx, whose wins included the Coventry Stakes and the Pavilion Stakes. With Stott in the saddle, Hello Youmzain took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and drew away to win by three and a quarter lengths from Calyx. After the race Stott said \\"This horse has been a legend for me. He ran in the Greenham and didn't stay, so we dropped him back to six. He has a lot of speed, we got a lovely tow and he quickened up well... He's a very good horse\\". At Royal Ascot on 21 June Hello Youmzain was stepped up to Group 1 level for the first time and started at odds of 6/1 for the Commonwealth Cup. After racing towards the rear in the early stages he kept on well to come home third behind Advertise and the filly Forever In Dreams, with Ten Sovereigns in fourth. The colt was entered for the Nunthorpe Stakes at York Racecourse in August but was withdrawn on account of the unsuitably firm ground. After a break of two and a half months Hello Youmzain returned on 7 September for the Group 1 Sprint Cup at Haydock, a race which saw him matched against older horse for the first time. Ridden by Doyle he was one of three 9/2 co-favourites alongside Khadeem (Stewards' Cup) and Dream of Dreams (second in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes) in an eleven-runner field which also included The Tin Man, Fairyland, Brando (Prix Maurice de Gheest), Waldpfad (Hackwood Stakes) and Invincible Army (Duke of York Stakes). In a change of tactics, Hello Youmzain led from the start and held off the late challenge of The Tin Man to win by half a length with two lengths back to Waldpfad in third. Doyle commented \\"He hasn't been entirely straightforward, but the engine's always been there and the whole team have done a great job to manage that and channel it all in the right direction\\" while Kevin Ryan said \\"He's such a young horse and he's a big horse. He's going to improve and strengthen. You shouldn‚Äôt wish your life away but when you see him next year, he's going to be bigger and stronger\\". Shortly after his win at Haydock the colt was bought by the Cambridge Stud and the Haras d'Etreham in a private deal. On 19 October Hello Youmzain was made 6/1 third favourite behind Advertise and One Master for the British Champions Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at Ascot. Racing on heavy ground he led for most of the way after being overtaken a furlong out he faded badly and came home eighth behind the 33/1 upset winner Donjuan Triumphant. =2020: four-year-old season= The flat racing season in Britain and Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak and Hello Youmzain did not make his reappearance until 20 June when he was ridden by Stott and started the 4/1 second favourite for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes which was run behind closed doors at Royal Ascot. The Irish challenger Sceptical went off favourite after an impressive win in the Woodlands Stakes while the other eight runners were Khadeem, Dream of Dreams, One Master, The Tin Man, Sands of Mali, Speak In Colours (Renaissance Stakes), Breathtaking Look (Sceptre Stakes) and Shine So Bright (City of York Stakes). Hello Youmzain started quickly and disputed the lead for most of the way before being headed by Khadeem and Sceptical approaching the final furlong. He rallied strongly in the closing stages and regained the advantage to win by a head from the fast-finishing Dream of Dreams. After the race Stott commented \\"I feel blessed to be back on him after his change of ownership. I can't describe how thankful I am. It means everything. Kevin gave me a lot of confidence going out riding him. Fair play to the horse. He dug deep when I needed him and deserves all the credit, not me\\" while Kevin Ryan's son Adam said \\"He's done it the hard way but he was very impressive. He did well over the winter, matured again and his work's been good. We always thought he might be the finished article and it's great for the team\\". In the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket on 11 July Hello Youmzain started the 9/2 third favourite behind Golden Horde and Sceptical, but after appearing to have every chance entering the last quarter mile he faded in the closing stages and came home fifth of the twelve runners, beaten four lengths by the winner Oxted.

The methylation of mercury can occur abiotically or biotically. Biotically, the primary methylators of mercury are sulfate-reducing and iron-reducing bacteria. Three mechanisms have been proposed for the biotic methylation of mercury by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Mercury methylation can be problematic as methylmercury is toxic and can be bio-magnified through the food web.  Chemistry  Chemical elements on Earth cycle through atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic environments in a process called biogeochemical cycling. Mercury goes through its own version of biogeochemical cycling named the mercury cycle where it circulates through the environment and changes between oxidation states: Hg(0), Hg(I), Hg(II). When mercury is present in the environment microbial organisms can uptake the elemental form of mercury. This signals the transcription of the genes hgcA and hgcB are transcribed to synthesize the HgcA and HgcB proteins. These proteins can then start the methylation reaction to form methylmercury. = Biochemical =  Microbial  Species from all three domains of life have been found to play a role in the methylation of mercury. More species have been discovered that genetically are capable of mercury methylation due to the discovery of the hgcAB genes. It is not known if the HgcA and HgcB proteins create a multienzyme complex or work sequentially. It has also been shown that deletion of either gene results in the complete loss of the ability to methylate mercury. Bacterial species currently known to methylate mercury include the major of Desulfovibrio spp. (i.e. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans). and Geobacter spp. (i.e. Geobacter sulfurreducens) Other species with the hgcAB genes that suspected to produce MeHg include Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae. Archaeal species known to methylate mercury include the majority of species of methanogen class Methanomicrobia, however, class Thermoplasmata has been found to carry the hgcAB genes. No other species of methanogens have been found with the ability of mercury methylation.  Reactions  pH influences on mercury methylation can be variable depending on the species that are undergoing the reactions. Some findings demonstrate that an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration resulted in large increases of the Hg(II) uptake, leading to potential impacts on the actual methylation of mercury. Another finding demonstrated that the decrease in pH leads to a shift in the production of methyl mercury species. Specifically, the production of dimethylmercury decreases and the production of monomethylmercury increases, but total remains essentially constant. Enough adequate studies on the temperature influences on the methylation of mercury have not been published. Mercury methylation reaches maximum activity in the summer but this enhanced methylation may be due to other factors unrelated to temperature. However, it is evident that temperature affects microbial activity which will correspond to an impact on the subsequent biochemical reactions that lead to methylation of mercury. Similar to the pH effects, different concentrations of available mercury ion lead to different products and complexes of mercury being produced. In addition, the enzymes HgcA and HgcB have a very low Km and will therefore readily bind to the available mercury even at very low concentrations.  Transport into cell  Before mercury can be methylated, it must be transported into the cell through the lipid membrane. Mercury ions are bound by a mercury scavenger protein, MerP. MerP transfers the mercury ion to a cytoplasmic membrane transporter, MerT, then to the active site of mercuric reductase or mercury(II) reductase in the cytoplasm. Normally mercury would be toxic to the cell, but some microorganisms are resistant to mercury ion due to an inducible mer operon. Translation of the operon results in the synthesis of mercuric reductase. Mercuric reductase will reduce the mercury ion into elemental mercury, which is volatilized from the cell. If mercuric reductase is not employed, methylation of mercury can occur via three identified pathways.  Biochemical pathway  Cultures of sulfate reducing bacteria grown without the presence of sulfate will not methylate mercury. It is a possibility that the respiration of these cells is coupled to mercury methylation. The Acetyl-CoA pathway for mercury methylation is done by sulfate reducing bacteria and is catalyzed by a corrinoid dependent protein. Through this pathway, the methyl group is proposed to originate from C-3 serine. A transfer of the methyl group from CH3-Tetrahydrofolate to the corrinoid protein requires the genes hgcA and hgcB . The methyl group now on the corrinoid protein will then be transferred to mercury ion. This activity was shown to decrease in aerobic environments, suggesting that the methylation occurs anaerobically. Acetate Metabolic pathway (methyl-transferase enzymes) is very similar to the acetyl CoA pathway, where methyltransferase enzymes involving tetrahydrofolate intermediates are utilized. It was shown that methylation of mercury was greater by three orders of magnitude in cells that were capable of utilizing acetate. Methylation of mercury can also occur using a cobalamin dependent methionine synthase. The cobalamin dependent process requires the use of the substrate S-adenosylmethionine, a biological methylating agent. As methionine synthase was used, it is possible that the enzyme that methylates mercury is also able to transfer methyl groups from CH3-Tetrahydrofolate to thiols. = Environmental impact =  Animal health  Methyl mercury is a toxic substance to living organisms. The toxicity of methylmercury in humans is due to methyl mercury crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing cell lysis in the central nervous system. The cell damage is irreversible. The half-life of methylmercury in human tissue is 70 days, which allows it ample time to accumulate to toxic levels. Humans are exposed to methyl mercury from the consumption of aquatic species. As mercury bioaccumulates through the food chain, the amount of methyl mercury increases to these toxic levels.

His works include components of spatial intervention, plays on sign systems, and representations of language in codified forms, such as hand-written Morse or binary code‚Äî0's and 1's.  Early life and education  Ayzay Ukwuoma was born in Los Angeles, where as a youth, he began painting ephemeral public-facing non-commissioned art works. He is an MFA graduate of CalArts, and has a master's degree in information systems and technology from George Washington University.Ukwuoma, Ezennwa, \\"Discovery Art : l‚Äôintervention de l‚Äôobservateur.\\" Inter Art actuel; Number 120, (spring 2015), pp. 43-46 .  Art in books  While in Europe during the early 2010s, Ukwuoma began creating large paintings on unstretched canvas, which he would share with others in a unique way. Adjusting the overall composition of his works in order to make them more accessible, Ukwuoma would cut his paintings into small pieces for placement inside of books. He would then visit the art sections of libraries and bookstores, and place his painting pieces inside of books for future discovery. On the back of each painting piece, signed with an alias of \\"ETMCA\\", Ukwuoma left hand-written instructions to enable a response, and received multiple replies from discoverers of his works. Ukwuoma, Ezennwa, \\"Discovery Art : l‚Äôintervention de l‚Äôobservateur.\\" Inter Art actuel; Number 120, (Spring 2015), pp. 43-46 . = In cities = Ukwuoma developed this approach of distributing his works into a series of exhibitions, held in the art sections of numerous major city libraries within Europe. Upon arrival in a city, he would search for a library in which to place a painting, occasionally gifting those that met and assisted him with pieces from the painting itself. Each painting was entitled with the name of the city in which he had placed it, including Berlin, Grenoble, Marseille, Paris, Rome, Valence, Valencia, and Venice. Ukwuoma retained a large piece of each painting as a remnant of the network of paintings for exhibition, and presented them in Dubai in 2014. Ukwuoma stated that he recognized the entirety of each \\"city\\" painting as a network, which connected a set of people in the general landscape of the city where it was placed, within two degrees of separation. = As a poem = In 2012, Ukwuoma created a poem called 'The Ones', and encoded the poem in Morse code. He painted the poem across ten black unstretched canvases, and upon cutting them, began a new series of placements for this series of art in books in Los Angeles.The artist explained that his motivation for creating the 20-line poem was: \\" ...to compose a commemorative work dedicated to 'The Ones', a figurative group of people that anyone can identify with as their ancestors, predecessors or 'ones' that existed, sacrificed, or performed the work that has made the lives, livelihood, or pursuits we each enjoy possible. The 'ones' that come to mind for one person may differ from the ‚Äúones‚Äù of another. However, this poem was created to give respect to ALL of the 'ones'.\\"  References  Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American artists ","title":"Ayzay Ukwuoma"},{"id":"61883013","text":"Ashish Chaudhary (born 15 October 1998) is an Indian cricketer.

She won the MacArthur Fellowship in 2019. According to Newsday, she was the only \\"overseas\\" fellow recognized in 2019. Her research focuses primarily on working with the practices of local communities to develop effective strategies that conserve and protect the coastal systems. She performs her work primarily in Melanesia, a Pacific region including Fiji, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea. Education Jupiter attended Harvard University and received a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Biology in 1997. In 2006 Jupiter received a PhD which focused on the connections between land usage and downstream impacts from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Early life Jupiter has enjoyed nature from a very young age. As an undergraduate, Jupiter volunteered abroad in Australia working with the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales. Jupiter volunteered with the Peace Corps after college in Gabon, central Africa. This experience allowed her to gain exposure to pollution of the downstream systems and inspired her to go on to graduate school. During graduate school, Jupiter attended a lecture by Peter Walsh who had previously worked with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). WCS appealed to Jupiter while in graduate school and she later began to work for the organization beginning as an Associate Conservation Scientist, then the Fiji Country Program Director, and as Melanesia Regional Director since 2014. Research  Back in 2009, Jupiter began to realize how harmful flooding could be as she witnessed water destroying houses and roads on the island of Fiji. After some preliminary research, Jupiter realized that large floods spread many waterborne diseases. This discovery led Jupiter to ask herself if members of local communities would strive to do something if they realized their well- being was at risk. Environmental advocacy became Jupiter‚Äôs mission. Jupiter works primarily in Melanesia, an area containing much biodiversity. According to Jupiter, many people in the Pacific do not separate themselves from nature as Westerners tend to do. As a result, looking for ways to conserve the environment is this area is important to her. Although Jupiter is experienced in marine science, she knew little about the culture of Fiji upon first arriving. Jupiter strives to work alongside fishermen and villagers to learn from them firsthand and collect scientific research from her observations. Many Melanesian communities use a method called tabu (a periodic closure to fishing) to manage coral reef natural resources. Working alongside villagers and observing processes such as tabu, Jupiter attempts to help local communities decide when, where, and how long to close off the areas of the reef. With this research, Jupiter believes the sustainability of thousands of tabu areas across the southwestern Pacific could be improved. Her research also links both the land and sea by considering the effects industries such as logging and mining have on coral reefs. With the help of other collaborators, Jupiter has shown how the rise of logging and mining not only have negative effects on the water quality of coral reefs, but they also increase the risk of transmitting waterborne diseases like typhoid. MacArthur Fellowship Award  In 2019 Jupiter was recognized by the MacArthur Foundation for her efforts to save lives and coral reefs by building on already existing research and considering new ways to manage natural resources. The MacArthur fellowships are awarded yearly by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for ‚Äúextraordinary originality and dedication‚Äù. This award also comes with an award of $625,000 over five years. Jupiter was one of 26 fellows chosen. Other work  Jupiter believes that the support of local communities is necessary before her work can be applied to marine conservation. Although Jupiter knows the language of scientists, she recognizes that members of the public do not. As a result, Jupiter has personalized her research and materials to fit her audience. One way Jupiter does this is through developing concepts for comic books. One comic book is about a goby fish who travels throughout the river and come into contact with challenges related to environmental concerns caused by human influence. She also developed puppet shows for children using these stories. Jupiter also participated in a flash mob of 125 people dancing to a version of ‚ÄúStayin‚Äô Alive‚Äù. This flash mob which was then posted to YouTube was meant to draw the attention of the government to enact a particular set of regulations.

Together with other RE units recruited from Tottenham, it served in the great battles of 1916‚Äì18 on the Western Front, including the Somme, Arras, Ypres, the German Spring Offensive and the final Hundred Days Offensive. Background Alfred Leete's recruitment poster for Kitchener's Army. On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain's declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular Army and the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: 'Your King and Country Need You', urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener's First New Army, or 'K1'.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 2 & 8. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised on 10 December 1914, many of the units were being organised as 'Pals battalions' under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.See, for example, Middlebrook, Somme, pp. 9‚Äì11; Inglis, pp. 13‚Äì6. The six K5 divisions were to be numbered 37th to 42nd, but the War Office then decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units to train reinforcements for the K1‚ÄìK3 units, and on 10 May the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 40th Division, which had been constituted on 27 April 1915, thus became 33rd Division.Becke, Pt 3b, Appendix I. The infantry units were Pals' Battalions raised by London regiments (particularly the Public Schools Battalions and Sportsmen's Battalions), and the division's Royal Engineers (RE) were raised in Tottenham, North London.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 31‚Äì9.Seton-Hutchison, p. 3. Tottenham Royal Engineers On 11 February 1915 the War Office authorised the Tottenham Local Representative Committee, based at Tottenham Town Hall, to raise a field company of the Royal Engineers (RE), to be designated 212th (Field) Company (Tottenham). Soon this recruitment effort was expanded to the full RE complement for a division and then two Army Troops Companies in addition:The authorisations by the War Office were issued on 11 February (212th), 25 April (222nd), 3 May (HQ), 20 May (226th and Signals), 11 June (230th): War Office Instructions July 1915, Appendix VIII; 9 November (238th) War Office Instruction 107, November 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 32.

Both became serjeants; Minter was wounded and awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, while Weir was killed in action with the unit on 9 July 1918.Minter at Lives of the First World War.Weir at Lives of the First World War.Weir factfile at MEHSTG. The units were formally taken over by the military authorities on 14 July 1915 (later for the Army Troops companies). On that day the 212th and 222nd Field Companies joined the division at Clipstone Camp, Nottinghamshire, and 226th Field Company joined on 31 July, by which time the division had moved to Bulford Camp on Salisbury Plain for intensive battle training. On 4 November the division was ordered to embark for France, and by 21 November it had concentrated around Morbecque, where it joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for service on the Western Front. On 2 December, the division exchanged its 99th Brigade for the experienced 19th Brigade from the 2nd Division; 226th Field Company went with it to 2nd Division and 33rd Divisional Engineers received the Regular 11th Field Company, RE, in its place.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 41‚Äì7.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 27, 51.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 41. Service 33rd Divisional insignia. =Somme= After routine service in the trenches, 33rd Division's first offensive operations came during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. It was in Corps Reserve during the Battle of Albert (12‚Äì13 July 1916), but was committed during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge and subsequent Attacks on High Wood (14‚Äì21 July). The division's first attack on High Wood on 15 July was a costly failure, but 19th Brigade made a second attempt on 20 July. 1st and 5th/6th Battalions Scottish Rifles led, supported by 20th (3rd Public Schools) Bn Royal Fusiliers with three sections of 11th Field Company and two companies of 18th (1st Public Works) Bn Middlesex Regiment (the divisional pioneers). Initially, the attack was a success, but it became held up by enemy machine guns. With the supports thrown in, the brigade managed to take most of the wood and the pioneers dug in. Holding the gains over the following weeks under heavy shellfire was very costly.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 16‚Äì19. In early August the division was withdrawn for a period of rest before returning to the High Wood‚ÄìDelville Wood sector on 18 August. The German positions had been strengthened and progress was painfully slow, but the division put in a successful attack on 24 August. The rest of High Wood was finally captured on 24 September, by which time 33rd Division had been relieved.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 19‚Äì22. It returned to the Somme later in the year and captured Dewdrop Trench on 28 October, but further progress towards Le Transloy was hampered by ground conditions that the engineers and pioneers struggled to overcome.Seton- Hutchison, pp. 25‚Äì8. RE Signallers taking telephone wire up to the front line, Ypres Salient, October 1917. =1917= The 33rd Division was engaged at the Battle of Arras (1917), including the First and Second Battles of the Scarpe (14 and 23‚Äì23 April) and subsequent actions on the Hindenburg Line (20‚Äì30 May). During these operations the division suffered heavy casualties, including a number of RE officers.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 35‚Äì45. It was then transferred to the Flanders Coast where it took part in operations on 18‚Äì28 August.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 62‚Äì4. 33rd Division transferred to the Ypres sector in September, in time to take part in the Third Ypres Offensive. The division's preparations for the Battle of Polygon Wood were badly disrupted by a German surprise attack on 25 September, which caused heavy casualties and took many of the jumping-off positions. Nevertheless, the attack was reorganised overnight and went in on schedule the following morning, when 33rd Division took all its objectives.Lee, p. 220.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 67‚Äì73.Wolff, p. 199. A packhorse being loaded with duckboards, Ypres Salient, October 1917. The division then spent a terrible winter, doing tours of duty in the Passchendaele Salient. While the infantry attempted to make small gains, the engineers constructed concrete dugouts, underground galleries and drainage systems. Important achievements were the construction of a double duckboard track (the 'Mule Track') as far into the salient as Tyne Cot, and a Decauville narrow-gauge railway as far as Crest Farm.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 75‚Äì8. =1918= During the German Spring Offensive the division was engaged in a series of actions during the Battle of the Lys. It had been moved down from Ypres to the Arras sector and taken up positions at M√©teren to plug a hole in the broken front. On 12 April 19th and 98th Brigades held the line, reinforced by RE signallers and any other troops who could be obtained, while a lorry toured the rear areas to find RE dumps of barbed wire to strengthen the defences. The German attack was renewed on 13 and 14 April, when the situation became critical, and the division had to withdraw to a new line. By the morning of 15 April new defences had been dug, which were defended during the next two days. At 17.00 on 16 April, the pioneer battalion (18th Middlesex) and 11th Field Company made a counter-attack through M√©teren itself, taking prisoners and stabilising the position until French reinforcements arrived.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 85‚Äì96. Meanwhile, 100th Brigade had defended Neuve Eglise. The RE companies suffered heavy casualties in these actions.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 100‚Äì6. A duckboard track in the Ypres Salient, October 1917. The division was relieved on 20 April. It went back into the line on 6 May near Dickebusch Lake in the Ypres sector, where the German offensive had been switched. The camps and rear areas of the Ypres Salient were quickly turned into strong defensive positions to hold this flank, but the division's infantry were engaged in bitter fighting to hold their positions on 8 May. Fighting went on into June, but the German offensive had been broken. The division remained in this area until late August, training newly-arrived US troops.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 111‚Äì23. In September 33 Division joined Third Amy's advance over the old Somme battlefields as part of the Hundred Days Offensive, lending support with artillery and machine guns. The roads, bridges and villages in the area had been thoroughly destroyed, leading to much work for the sappers. The division attacked at Villers-Guislain on 21 September at the Battle of √âpehy, running into bitter defence by the enemy. Casualties from Mustard Gas were high, particularly among the signallers, and the attack was only partly successful. A second attempt by 33rd Division to take Villers-Guislain on 29 September as part of the Battle of St. Quentin Canal also brought heavy casualties, but the enemy later evacuated the positions following the Allied success elsewhere. On 4 October the RE constructed bridges over the St. Quentin Canal and next day the division crossed in force and occupied the Hindenburg Line.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 127‚Äì37. During the subsequent pursuit to the River Selle, 19th Bde, accompanied as usual by 11th Field Company, and by detachments of artillery, cavalry and machine guns, advanced rapidly, clearing a succession of villages until it met strong opposition at the river itself. The brigade made an advance of seven and a half miles in a few hours on 9 October.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 220.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 138‚Äì40. During the night of 11/12 October, 11th and 212th (Tottenham) Field Companies, under the CRE, brought down their pontoon wagons and built 12 footbridges (two for pack horses) over the Selle, with little interference from the enemy and suffering only two casualties as the German machine-gun fire was high. The infantry crossed the bridges as soon as they were ready, and formed up on the eastern bank ready to assault at 05.00. However, a German counter-attack drove them back across the river by the end of the day.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 250.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 141‚Äì2. The advance was renewed during the subsequent Battle of the Selle (23 October), with the RE repairing bridges and roads as they went. In front of the Forest of Mormal 33rd Division captured the village of Englefontaine by an enveloping movement. The division was relieved on 26/27 October, but was back in action on 5 November for the Battle of the Sambre, advancing through the forest towards the River Sambre. That afternoon the leading battalions crossed the river and established bridgeheads. 212th Field Company erected a bridge for wheeled traffic before nightfall.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 361‚Äì3.Seton- Hutchison, pp. 144‚Äì52. By November 1918, 222nd Field Company had left the 33rd Division and had been converted into 222nd Army Troops (Works) Company, operating in V Corps' area. However, on the night of 5 November it was also engaged in building bridges across the Sambre for 33rd Division, while infantry parties crossed by floating cork footbridges. By the time the division was relieved on 7 November it was established on the Avesnes‚ÄìMaubeuge road.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 497.Seton-Hutchison, p. 152. =226th (Tottenham) Field Company= This company served with 2nd Division on the Western Front throughout 1916‚Äì18. The division was in reserve on 21 May 1916 when the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack to recover captured positions on Vimy Ridge. 99th Brigade was sent up as reinforcements, and it was ordered to launch an attack at 20.25 on 23 May to regain the trenches that had been lost. The brigade had been heavily bombarded since 11.30 that morning, and its shallow jumping-off trenches had been obliterated. A company commander protested that it would be murder to proceed with the attack and it was called off, but the cancellation order did not reach B Company, 22nd (Kensington) Battalion Royal Fusiliers. Together with their attached section of 226 Field Company, 5 and 8 Platoons of B Company went 'over the top' as scheduled, into a storm of machine gun and shell fire. Although they succeeded in rushing the first trench and began consolidating their position, casualties had been extremely heavy. The Kensingtons' medical officer went out to call the survivors back, finding that the two platoons and sapper section had been 'wiped out'. 226 Field Company had lost 40 men during their week at Vimy.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 216‚Äì21.Inglis, pp. 99‚Äì109. Later on the Somme 2nd Division took part in the Battle of Delville Wood and other actions. It was engaged in a number of small actions in early 1917, followed by the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other actions during the Battle of Arras. It fought in the latter stages of the Battle of Cambrai, in the German Spring Offensive and the Allied Hundred Days Campaign culminating in the pursuit after the Battle of the Sambre.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 496. =230th and 238th (Tottenham) Army Troops Companies= 230th Army Troops Company served on the Western Front with First Army Troops RE from January 1916.

Demobilisation of 33rd Division proceeded rapidly in 1919 and units dwindled to cadre strength before embarking for home. The division and its New Army units were formally disbanded on 30 June, while the Regular 11th Field Company returned to Aldershot Garrison in May. However, 33rd Divisional Signal Company, RE, appears to have continued as Third Army Area Signals in France and Flanders until October 1919.Lord & Watson, p. 222. The numbers 212, 222, 226, 230 and 238 were reassigned to existing Territorial Army field companies in the 1920s, and 33rd Division was never revived.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 99‚Äì100.

It is one of the national symbols of Italy and is composed of the three colors of the Italian flag with the green in the center, the white immediately outside and the red on the edge: this convention on the position of colors derives from the cockades used in Bologna in 1794 during an attempt of revolt, which had this chromatic composition. The cockade with the red and green inverted position is instead that of Iran. The Italian tricolor cockade appeared for the first time in Genoa on 21 August 1789, and with it the colors of the three Italian national colors, anticipating by seven years the first tricolor military banner, which was adopted by the Lombard Legion on 11 October 1796, and of eight years the birth of the flag of Italy, which had its origins on 7 January 1797, when it became for the first time a national flag of an Italian sovereign State, the Cispadane Republic. The hypotheses that consider the birth of the three Italian national colors ascribable to the medieval or Renaissance period, or linked to Freemasonry, are rejected by historians. The green, white and red applied to a tricolor cockade reappeared during the failed uprising of Bologna against the Papal States of 13‚Äì14 November 1794 by Luigi Zamboni and Giovanni Battista De Rolandis. On 14 June 1848, it replaced the azure cockade on the uniforms of some departments of the Royal Sardinian Army (become Royal Italian Army in 1861), while on 1 January 1948, with the birth of the Italian Republic, it took its place as a national ornament. The Italian tricolor cockade is one of the symbols of the Italian Air Force and one of its fabric reproductions is sewn onto the meshes of the sports teams holding the Italian Cups which are organized in various national team sports. History =The birth of the three Italian colors on a cockade= The Phrygian cap with a French tricolor cockade, symbols of the Revolution During the French revolution, the red, white and blue tricolor cockade was adopted, among other symbols, which contributed to the affirmation of the three colors on the heraldic symbols of the French nobles, becoming synonymous with change; for some years, all over Europe, those who wore a cockade were therefore viewed with great suspicion. Later the meaning of change assigned to the French tricolor cockade crossed the Alps and arrived in Italy together with the use of the cockade and all the baggage of values of the French revolution, which were perpetrated by the Jacobinism of the origins, including the ideals of social renewal - on the basis of the advocacy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 - and subsequently also political, with the first patriotic ferments directed at national self-determination which subsequently led, on the Italian peninsula, to the Risorgimento. Camille Desmoulins, who invented the French tricolor cockade The first sporadic demonstrations in favor of the ideals of the French revolution, by the Italian population, took place in August 1789 with the appearance, especially in the Papal States, of cockades of makeshift constituted by simple green leaves of trees, which were pinned on the clothes of the protesters recalling similar protests in France at the dawn of the revolution shortly before the adoption of the blue, white and red tricolor. On 12 July 1789, two days before the storming of the Bastille, the revolutionary journalist Camille Desmoulins, while hailing the Parisian crowd to revolt, asked the protesters what color to adopt as a symbol of the French revolution, proposing the green hope or the blue of the American revolution, symbol of freedom and democracy: the protesters replied \\"The green! The green! We want green cockades!\\" Desmoulins then seized a green leaf from the ground and pointed it to the hat as a distinctive sign of the revolutionaries. The green, in the primitive French cockade, was immediately abandoned in favor of blue and red, or the ancient colors of Paris, because it was also the color of the king's brother, Count of Artois, who became monarch after the First Restoration with the name of Charles X of France. The French tricolor cockade was then completed on 17 July 1789 with the addition of white, the color of the House of Bourbon, in deference to King Louis XVI of France, who was still ruling despite the violent revolts that raged in the country: the French monarchy was in fact abolished later, on 10 August 1792. Later the Italian population began to use real cockades made of cloth: the green of the leaves of the trees already used previously, were added white and red so as to recall in a more marked way the revolutionary ideals represented by the French tricolor. The first documented trace of the use of Italian national colors is dated 21 August 1789: in the historical archives of the Republic of Genoa it is reported that eyewitnesses had seen some demonstrators pinned on their clothes hanging a red, white and green cockade on their clothes. The Italian gazettes of the time had in fact created confusion about the facts of French revolution, especially on the replacement of green with blue and red, reporting the news that the French tricolor was green, white and red. The green was then maintained by the Italian Jacobins because it represented nature and therefore - metaphorically - also natural rights, or social equality and freedom. =The tricolor cockade becomes one of the National symbols of Italy= The three Italian national colors carved on the floor of the Palazzo delle Poste in Florence. After their appearance in Genoa on 21 August 1789, red, white and green gradually became part of the Italian collective imagination until they were represented in the most varied areas Later the green, white and red cockade always spread to a greater extent, gradually becoming the only ornament used in Italy by the rioters. The patriots began to call it \\"Italian cockade\\" making it become one of the symbols of the country. In fact, the error of journalistic headings on the colors of the French tricolor cockade was clarified, and consequently the connotations of uniqueness were assumed, green, white and red were adopted by the Risorgimento patriots as one of the most important symbols of the insurrectional and political struggle, aimed at completing the national unit taking the name of \\"Italian tricolor\\". The green, white and red tricolor thus acquired a strong patriotic value, becoming one of the symbols of national awareness, a change that gradually led it to enter the collective imagination of the Italians. The Italian tricolor cockade, as well as all the similar ornaments made in the same period also in other countries, had as its main characteristic that it could be clearly visible, thus giving way to unequivocally identify the political ideas of the person who wore it, as well as to be, if necessary, better hidden than, for example, a flag. The use of the Italian tricolor was not limited to the presence of green, white and red in a cockade: the latter, having been born on 21 August 1789, heralded by seven years the first tricolor war flag, which was chosen by the Lombard Legion on 11 October 1796, which is associated with the first official approval of the Italian national colors by the authorities, in this case Napoleon, and eight years the adoption of the flag of Italy, which was born on 7 January 1797, when it first assumed the role of the national banner of a sovereign Italian state, the Cispadane Republic. The subsequent adoption by the Italian patriots of the green, white and red tricolor was immediate, unambiguous and devoid of political contrasts: in France the opposite happened, since the French tricolor was taken as a symbol first by the Republicans and then by the Bonapartists, that they were in antagonism with the Monarchists and the Catholics, who had the royal white flag with the fleur-de-lis of France as their reference flag. =The cockade of the Bologna revolt= View of Bologna From a historical perspective, given the judicial process and the clamor that followed, were the tricolor cockades made in 1794 by two students of the University of Bologna, Luigi Zamboni from Bologna and Giovanni Battista De Rolandis from Asti, who placed themselves at the head of an insurrectional attempt to free Bologna from papal rule; in addition to the two students there were also two medical doctors, Antonio Succi and Angelo Sassoli, who then betrayed the patriots by referring everything to the papal police, and four other people (Giuseppe Rizzoli, known as Dozza, Camillo Tomesani, twisted neck, Antonio Forni Mago Sabino and Camillo Galli). Luigi Zamboni had previously expressed the desire to create a tricolor flag that would become the flag of a united Italy. During this revolt attempt, which took place between 13 and 14 November 1794 (or, according to other sources, 13 December 1794), the demonstrators led by De Rolandis and Zamboni flaunted a red and white cockade (which are also the colors of the municipal coat of arms of Bologna) having a green lining. These cockades were made by Zamboni's parents, who made the tradesmen by trade and then paid dearly for this initiative. These cockades had green in the center, white immediately outside and red on the edge. During the recruitment work, De Rolandis and Zamboni managed to convince thirty people to participate in their attempt at insurrection [27]. The two, to carry out the attempted revolt, purchased some firearms which later proved to be of poor quality. The goal was to spread a leaflet intended to give rise to Bologna and Castel Bolognese, proclaiming that there was no effect whatsoever. View of the Giardino della Montagnola in Bologna, where Zamboni and De Rolandis were buried. Their bodies were later dispersed. After failing to raise the city, the revolutionaries tried to take refuge in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, but the local police first captured them in Covigliaio and then handed them over to the papal authorities; after the capture of the fugitives, the latter launched an action \\"\\" (a prosecution for fomenting armed treasonous conspiracy throughout the state) at the Tribunale del Torrone (the Inquisition of Bologna). The trial involved all the participants in the insurrectional attempt, the family of Zamboni and the Succi brothers. Zamboni was found dead in a cell nicknamed \\"Inferno\\" (\\"Hell\\"), which he shared with two common criminals, probably killed by them on the orders of the police or perhaps suicide after an unsuccessful attempt to escape, on 18 August 1795 (other hypotheses they actually want it to be a murder whose principals are to be found in some senatorial Bolognese families, in the Savioli family in particular). De Rolandis was publicly executed, after being subjected to interrogation preceded and followed by ferocious torture, on 26 April 1796. Zamboni's father died of heart almost eighty years after suffering terrible torture, while his mother was first whipped through the streets of Bologna and then sentenced to life imprisonment. The other defendants, where they had minor penalties, were freed shortly thereafter by the French, who in the meantime had invaded Emilia driving out the pontiffs. The bodies of De Rolandis and Zamboni were then solemnly buried in Bologna in the Giardino della Montagnola on the direct order of Napoleon, before being dispersed in 1799 with the arrival of the Austrians. Of the original cockades of Zamboni and De Rolandis, only one has come down to us. The historic cockade, which is owned by the De Rolandis family, has been exhibited for some time in the National Museum of the Italian Risorgimento in Turin. In 2006, during some renovations, it was transferred to the European Student Museum of the University of Bologna, where it is still preserved. The tricolor cockade appeared, after the events of Bologna, during Napoleon's entry into Milan, which took place on 15 May 1796. These cockades, having the typical circular shape, possessed red on the outside, green on an intermediate position and white on the center. These ornaments were worn by the rioters even during the religious ceremonies officiated inside the Milan Cathedral as thanks for the arrival of Napoleon, who was seen, at least initially, as a liberator. The tricolor cockades then became one of the official symbols of the Milanese National Guard, which was founded on 20 November 1796, and then spread elsewhere along the Italian peninsula. Color position The Italian tricolor cockade, by convention, has the green in the center, the white in an intermediate position and the peripheral red: this custom derives from one of the conceptual characteristics of the cockades, which can be imagined as flags rolled around the flagpole seen from above. In the case of the Italian tricolor cockade, the green is located in the center because in the flag of Italy this color is the one closest to the flagpole. The tricolor cockades with red and green inverted position are those of Iran and Suriname. The Hungarian cockade has the same arrangement of colors as the Italian tricolor cockade: having the color position reversed like the Iranian cockade and the Surinamese one is an urban legend. Other cockades identical to the Italian one, even in the arrangement of the colors, are the national ornaments of Burundi, Mexico, Lebanon, Seychelles, Algeria and Turkmenistan. The national ornament of Bulgaria and Maldives (both of which are, starting from the center, white, green and red) and Madagascar (which is, starting from the center, white, red and green). Use =Institutions and aeronautics= The cockade of Italy painted on a North American T-6 Texan It is tradition, for the highest offices of the Italian State, excluding the President of the Italian Republic, to have pinned on the jacket, during the military parade of the Festa della Repubblica, which is celebrated every 2 June, a tricolor cockade. On the Italian planes used during the First World War, with the use of coloring the underside of the lower wing with green, white and red sections for the recognition of the nationality, in 1917, they began to appear on the fuselages and on the wings of the tricolor circular cockades which, in some cases, had the green perimeter and the red central disk, therefore with a position of the colors which was the inverse of that conventionally used then for the Italian tricolor cockade. Gianluigi Buffon in 2016, wearing the Coccarda won with Juventus F.C. the season prior. Also present in the image is the Scudetto, worn by the current holders of the Serie A title The Italian tricolor cockade was used, on the airplanes, in a discontinuous way, until 1927, when it was replaced by a rosette depicting the lictor's fasces, one of the most identifying symbols of fascism. In aeronautics the tricolor cockade with the red towards the outside and the green at the center is back in use, without being changed, in 1943, during the World War II, on the occasion of the constitution of the Italian Co-belligerent Air Force: after the fall of fascism in Italy, there was in fact the immediate disappearance of all the symbols linked to it, including the lictor's fasces. The tricolor cockade, which was then widely used on all Italian state aircraft, not only military, is still today one of the symbols of the Italian Air Force. =Sport= In Italian sport, following a tradition born in football in the late fifties of the 20th century (and reflecting the praxis of the scudetto, which debuted on Genoa jerseys in the 1924‚Äì25 season based on an idea by Gabriele D'Annunzio), the tricolor cockade has become the distinctive symbol of the successes in the national cups, sewn on the jersey of the team holding the trophy: the winning formations in the various Italian Cups can in fact show off the cockade on their uniforms for the entire season following the victory. The Italian tricolor cockade made its debut in football in the 1958‚Äì59 season on Lazio shirts. In football, starting from the 1985‚Äì86 season, the cockade used for the teams holding the Coppa Italia underwent a change: the version with the inverted colors began to be used, that is with the green outside and the red in the center. From the 2006‚Äì07 season the original typology was restored, the one used by Zamboni and De Rolandis in 1794 during the revolt attempt in Bologna, with the red outside and the green in the center. In football, the cockade is also a symbol of the victories in the Coppa Italia Serie D, in the Coppa Italia Dilettanti and‚Äîwith substantial stylistic differences‚Äîin the Coppa Italia Serie C.  Italian azure cockade  1818 depiction of a Carabiniere. The Italian azure cockade can be seen placed on the hat The Italian azure cockade was one of the representative ornaments of Italy, obtained by circularly pleating an azure ribbon. Coming from the Savoy blue, the color of the Italian royal family from 1861 to 1946, the azure cockade remained officially in use until 1 January 1948, when the constitution of the Italian Republic came into force, after which it was replaced, in all official offices, from the Italian tricolor cockade. The azure cockade has its origins at least in the 17th century, as evidenced by some documents, which confirm its presence on military uniforms in use at the time of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia. Other sources testify to its use even in the 18th century. The Albertine Statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which was promulgated on 4 March 1848 and which later became the fundamental law of the Kingdom of Italy, foresaw that the azure cockade was the only national one. In this way the azure, historical color of the Kingdom of Sardinia and even before the Duchy of Savoy, was kept alongside the tricolor cockade, which was born in 1789 and which was instead very common among the population. On 14 June 1848, during the First Italian War of Independence, a circulaire from the Ministry of War decreed the replacement of the azure cockade, which until then had been placed on the hat of the uniform of the Carabinieri, with \\"the cockade to the three Italian national colors in accordance with the established models\\". This was not an exception: similarly the tricolor cockade replaced the azure one, for example, on the frieze of the Bersaglieri caps and on the headdresses of the soldiers of the cavalry regiments. On the hat of the Carabinieri the azure cockade was present since the founding of the weapon, which is dated 1814, while for the cavalry weapon its introduction can be ascribed to 1843, The azure cockade was instead used during the Sardinian campaign in central Italy in 1860, the siege of Gaeta (also dated 1860), the repression of post-unitary brigandage (1860-1870) and the Third Italian War of Independence (1866), in all cases pinned on the uniforms of the generals and that of the officers of the Royal Italian Army. The blue cockade was officially in use until 1 January 1948, when the Constitution of the Italian Republic came into force, being replaced, in all official locations, by the Italian tricolor cockade.

The history of the Jews in the Isle of Man goes back to at least the early 19th century. Background The Isle of Man ( , also ), sometimes referred to simply as Mann , is a self- governing British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Ireland. The head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, holds the title of Lord of Mann and is represented by a lieutenant governor. Defence is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. Jewish community There is a small Jewish community with the older congregational name of Isle of Man Hebrew Congregation now known as Manx Hebrew Congregation, without a synagogue or rabbi in the capital and largest town, Douglas. There is a Jewish cemetery on the island. Various reports and advertisements about the Jews on the Isle of Man have appeared in the English press going back about a hundred years. A 2016 report in The Jewish Chronicle stated that there were about 200 Jews on the island but they were not religious and mostly intermarried. World War I and World War II Jews were interned on the Isle of Man during both World Wars as 'enemy aliens'. During World War I it was German Jewish prisoners of war and in World War II it was Jewish refugees fleeing Germany and Austria. =World War I= In 1914 the British Government passed the Aliens Restriction Act. Citizens of Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire who were living in, or even only visiting the UK, were designated as possible \\"Enemy Aliens\\". Men of fighting age were interned for the whole duration of the war in special camps for civilian detainees. Camps were created at sites across the UK. As the war progressed, Prisoners of War were also put into the camps in London, The Isle of Man and Lofthouse Park. Over 32,000 civilian men were interned for some or all of the war. The Jewish Chronicle has archive evidence of the role that local British Jewish communities took on in support of some of the interned. =World War II= During World War II, to escape the Holocaust some sources state that there were about 1,500 German-Jewish civilian internees, whose spiritual and material welfare was supervised by the British Chief Rabbi's \\"Religious Emergency Council\\". Other sources state that it is estimated that about 2,000 to 3,000 people, mostly Jews, were interned on the Isle of Man during World War II as 'enemy aliens'. With frequent visits by Rabbi Dr. Solomon Schonfeld, who inspected internee camps on behalf of the Council. A writer for The Jewish Chronicle wrote in November 1940: :'Today the island has what must be the fullest Jewish life in the world. In ordinary camps on a weekday there are more worshippers than in the Great Synagogue, London, on a Sabbath.' Lectures were delivered on a variety of Jewish topics, and the community was served by two kosher boarding houses. Women and children internees were mostly housed in the areas of Port Erin and Port St Mary. Nazis and Jews from Germany initially shared internment facilities. The BBC reported in 2016 on the background to this saga, that at the start of World War II there were around 80,000 people in Britain who were considered potential \\"enemy aliens\\". The British government was afraid of spies and those who might assist the Nazis. In that light, the Isle of Man was chosen to accommodate people at camps in the towns of Douglas (see Hutchinson Internment Camp), Ramsey (see Mooragh Internment Camp) and Peel. The BBC report goes on to state that \\"political prisoners were detained in high security camps, but most internees - including many Jewish refugees - were free to go shopping, swim in the sea and attend classes. A few months later a mixed camp [for married couples] was established in Rushen.\\" Eventually the Jewish prisoners were released and some men given the option of joining the British armed forces. Reports of the time record that by August 1940, there were in total around 14,000 prisoners held on the Isle of Man, with thousands more transported to internment camps in Canada and Australia. At the Hutchinson Internment Camp in Douglas, numbers fell from September 1940 when the internees who posed no threat to Britain began to be released.Chappell, pp. 90-92 This was particularly marked in Hutchinson Camp, where there was an unusually high proportion of Jewish and anti-Nazi internees. The camp closed during March 1944, when its 228 inmates transferred to Peveril Internment Camp in Peel in order to clear Hutchinson Camp ready for use as a prisoner of war camp. In 2001 the Jewish community on the Isle of Man instituted its own Holocaust Memorial Day that is commemorated annually.

Four German divisions conducted a spoiling attack on the positions of the 1st Anzac Corps of the British Fifth Army. The attack was intended to delay the advance of the Fifth Army towards the Hindenburg Line, cause as many casualties and destroy as much equipment, particularly artillery, as possible. was also to deprive the British of the means to attack (IX Reserve Corps) as it fought the Battle of Arras (9 April to 16 May 1917) and (XIV Reserve Corps) to the south. The German commanders hoped to gain time to prepare more defences and to show that the retirement to the Hindenburg Line had not diminished German morale or the ability to attack. The Fifth Army was recovering from the First attack on Bullecourt (11 April) and preparing for the Battle of Bullecourt 3‚Äì17 May 1917, a bigger effort. The attack by two divisions of and two divisions of to the south, fell on the positions of the 1st Australian Division and 2nd Australian Division. The Australians repulsed the attacks, except at Lagnicourt, where German troops broke in, took prisoners, destroyed six artillery pieces and recovered confidential documents. Australian counter- attacks cut off some of the attackers and inflicted against The Fifth Army hurried forward more artillery and consolidated its defences, adding more advanced posts. Preparations for the next attack at Bullecourt continued and the Germans reinforced the Hindenburg Line () defences in the area. The attack was criticised by German commanders, especially its rushed preparations, sparse results and severe casualties. The British moved no reserves outside the 1st Anzac Corps area and continued the offensive at Arras. Background =Hindenburg Line= General Erich von Falkenhayn the German Chief of the General Staff was dismissed on 29 August 1916 and replaced by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff. (Third OHL, the new supreme command) ended the offensive at Verdun on the Western Front and requested proposals for a new shorter defensive position. Crown Prince Rupprecht, commander of Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria (), was ordered to prepare a rear defensive line and work on the new Hindenburg Line ( [Siegfried Position]) began. As the situation on the Somme deteriorated, Hindenburg ordered that the front be given priority in the west for troops and supplies. By the end of September Rupprecht had no reserves left on the Somme and another thirteen fresh divisions were sent to the British sector of the Somme, troops being scraped up wherever they could be found. For the (defensive battle) expected in 1917, the Hindenburg Line was to be built across the base of the Noyon Salient from Neuville Vitasse near Arras, through St Quentin and Laon to the Chemin des Dames ridge. The new fortified areas (, similar to ones built on the Russian front) were intended to be precautionary measures () and to shorten the Western Front, economising on troops, creating more reserves against the offensives expected in 1917. The had the potential to release the greatest number of troops and was begun first. =Operation Alberich= Ludendorff ordered 9 February to be the first day of the (Alberich Manoeuvre) and 16 March the first marching day. On 17 March, the 1st Army, at the north end of the Bapaume Salient, withdrew swiftly. was abandoned by 18 March and next day Boyelles and Boiry-Becquerelle were evacuated. The withdrawal went straight back to the (Hindenburg Line) except for outposts and raids were mounted on British outposts during 20 and 21 March. Bapaume was also abandoned, with many houses still on fire. Next day, parties of Germans at Beugny in the fought until nightfall then slipped away. A party at Vaulx- Vraucourt was surprised and driven back to Lagnicourt. Lagnicourt was lost on 26 March; a German counter-attack from Noreuil and a British attack on Bucquoy were repulsed. On 17 March, withdrawals by the 2nd Army began north of the Avre and by 18 March, the other German armies and the southern wing of the 6th Army began to withdraw from of the old front line ( as the crow flies). The Somme River and canal crossings from Offoy to P√©ronne were destroyed and pools of water wide, near road embankments, made crossings anywhere else impossible, the damage being made worse by the spring thaw. On 18 March the main body of German troops reached the Hindenburg Line () where work was still being done to remedy defects in the original position. Outpost villages close to the south of Qu√©ant had to be held for longer than expected to complete the extra work. Heudicourt, Sorel and Fins were lost on 30 March. The northern outpost villages were captured on 2 April and Lempire fell three days later. =XIV Reserve Corps= During the Battle of the Somme in 1916, divisions had quickly become exhausted and it had proved impractical to replace corps headquarters and their constituent divisions at the rate necessary to rest tired divisions; corps HQ remained on the Somme and took over fresh divisions as they arrived. By 1917 the connexion between Corps HQ and their component divisions had been dissolved on the rest of the Western Front and territorial titles introduced. After the retreat to the , the IX Reserve Corps, responsible for the line from the Scarpe to Croisilles, became and the XIV Reserve Corps ( [Lieutenant- General] Otto von Moser from 12 March 1917) held the from Croisilles to M≈ìuvres. The 6th Army HQ had decided that the front held by the was too vulnerable to be held by two divisions. On 13 April, the 6th Army chief of staff notified Moser that the 3rd Guard Division () was being transferred to the after having had three months of rest and training. Prelude =Fifth Army= The original British plan for the Fifth Army to co-operate with the Third Army attack into the salient formed around Bapaume during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 was made redundant. The German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line () forestalled the British attack and the Fifth Army was ordered to push back German rearguards and prepare to attack the Hindenburg Line between Qu√©ant and Bullecourt, to support the Third Army offensive, a much more difficult task. The Fifth Army had been stripped of divisions and artillery and bringing up the remaining guns and ammunition over the supply desert created by German demolitions was slow. The Hindenburg Line was far more formidable than the decrepit defences abandoned during the withdrawal but if the Fifth Army could penetrate the Hindenburg Line, the task of the Third Army, advancing south-eastwards down the Arras‚ÄìCambrai road would be eased. Bullecourt was from the road at Vis-en-Artois and under at Fontaine-l√®s- Croisilles, the first objective of the Cavalry Corps advancing in front of the Third Army. Gough suggested that the Fifth Army could support the main offensive but for lack of means could only attack on a narrow front. Bullecourt was substituted for Qu√©ant which was behind four defensive positions. The attack would then pivot to the right flank to capture the junction of the Hindenburg Line and the Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Switch Line (). If successful, the 4th Cavalry Division would pass through to meet the Cavalry Corps from Arras. Fifth Army attacks on 2 April captured the German outpost villages from Doignies to Croisilles and Gough ordered that risks be taken to advance as much heavy artillery as possible. On 5 April Gough issued orders to the V Corps and 1st Anzac Corps for an attack on a front with Bullecourt in the centre. Riencourt was the second objective and Hendecourt the third objective, where the 4th Cavalry Division was to advance to rendezvous with the Cavalry Corps. The Fifth Army received D Company, Tank Corps, five tanks for each corps and two in army reserve. The heavy guns were delayed by German road demolitions and the field artillery had to be moved in relays due to a shortage of horses. The 4th Australian Division was not able to use all its seven artillery brigades until 8 April, even after hauling field guns with crews and ammunition by lorry. On the right of V Corps to the north, the 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division took over from the 7th Division on 5 April; both divisional artilleries moved forward in stages and began wire cutting on 7 April. Australian patrols found no gaps in the wire, about deep, east of Bullecourt. =First attack on Bullecourt= 8‚Äì10 April ) defences around Bullecourt and Qu√©ant, 1917}} The Hindenburg Line defences enclosing the village of Bullecourt formed a re-entrant for about to the (Balcony Trench) around Qu√©ant, defended by the German 27th Division. On 8 April it was announced that wire cutting, begun on 5 April, would take another eight days. At dusk on 9 April, patrols went forward and found that the Hindenburg Line was occupied but that the wire cutting bombardment had made several lanes through the wire. Preparations were made in a rush, the 4th Australian Division to attack with two brigades, the 4th on the right and 12th on the left. The attack had to cover to the wire and another to the first trench at about an hour and 48 minutes before the sun rose, to evade crossfire in the re-entrant between Qu√©ant and Bullecourt. Artillery-fire would continue as normal until zero hour then maintain barrages on the flanks. At Bullecourt was subjected to a gas bombardment by Livens projectors and Stokes 4-inch mortars as the six Australian battalions assembled out in the snow of no man's land and waited for the tanks to arrive. The left flank of the 12th Australian Brigade was only from Bullecourt and dawn was approaching. Zero hour was put back but the tanks had only reached Noreuil and Holmes ordered the infantry back under cover; snow began to fall again and shielded the retirement. Patrols of the 2/7th and 2/8th battalions, West Yorkshire Regiment began to advance from and at the patrols began to retire having suffered 11 April At a conference at the 4th Australian Division HQ, it was decided that the infantry would advance fifteen minutes after the tanks, rather than wait on a signal from them. Only four tanks reached their start line by but drowning the sound of their engines with machine-gun fire failed and they were heard in the German defences. The tank on the right flank deviated to the right, suffered mechanical difficulties and returned to the railway. Another tank also veered right and crossed the first trench of the opposite Grenadier Regiment 123 and was knocked out by machine-guns firing armour-piercing (K bullet) ammunition. The next tank to reach the German lines was snagged by wire then crossed the first trench before being knocked out. The last tank started late followed a similar path to the first. The four tanks comprising the left-hand section were late and two were knocked out short of the German trenches; the third tank arrived behind the Australian infantry and silenced a machine-gun in Bullecourt. The tank was hit twice, returned to the railway and was hit again. The Australian infantry in the German defences were cut off. When the 4th Australian Brigade ran out of grenades it was forced back and the remnants of the brigade not taken prisoner tried to retreat and suffered many more casualties. In the 12th Australian Brigade, the 46th Australian Battalion in the first trench was forced out and the 48th Australian Battalion further forward was surrounded. The 48th Australian Battalion bombed its way back to the first trench. The artillery of the neighbouring 2nd Guard Division and 220th Division added to the defensive barrage in front of Bullecourt and prevented any renewal of the Australian attack. As the Australians were being forced back, they were unable to salvage ammunition and grenades from the dead and wounded. The British artillery had eventually begun to fire a barrage but this fell on the Australian-occupied trenches, making them untenable. The senior surviving Australian officer ordered the second trench to be evacuated and then the first. At the 48th Australian Battalion, the last in the German trenches, made an orderly retreated over the bullet-swept ground. By noon the German counter-attack had succeeded; few Australians had managed to re-cross no man's land through artillery and machine-gun fire. =Plan= Apart from British artillery bombardments, the area around Bullecourt had been quiet since the German victory on 11 April. The XIV Reserve Corps detected that the 1st Australian Division had taken over part of the front of the 4th Australian Division for the attack of 11 April, holding an front southwards from Qu√©ant. Casualties in the 4th Australian Division on 11 April led to the 1st Australian Division taking over another of front to the north. Major , the chief of staff, proposed to attack while the Australian and British troops opposite had not finished consolidating their positions and were disorganised after the attack on 11 April. On 13 April, Moser requested permission from the 6th Army HQ to use the 3rd Guard Division and the 2nd Guard Reserve Division () on the left flank of the for a spoiling attack on a from Lagnicourt southwards to Hermies. Army Group Rupprecht and the 6th Army HQ were willing to support any serious proposal for offensive action added the 38th Division () and the 4th Ersatz Division () from on the southern flank to the attack. To be quick, Moser wrote the plan and operations orders and Miaskowski prepared the plans for the support and supply services. The plans for were issued by the early hours of 14 April for an attack at on 15 April. The 2nd Guard Reserve Division was to attack on the northern flank to occupy Noreuil and Lagnicourt, the 3rd Guard Division to the left (south) was to attack Morchies and Boursies. Doignies and Demicourt were the objectives of the 38th Division and Hermies on the southern flank was the target of the 4th Ersatz Division. The attacking battalions were to be followed by engineers and in the latter two divisions by elements of their divisional , flame-thrower and detachments of light artillery. Two or three batteries of field artillery each were attached to each brigade.

The casualties and destruction inflicted on the opposing forces would limit their offensive capacity opposite and for long enough for the Germans to complete their defensive fortifications. The attack would demonstrate that the Germans retained considerable offensive power and that the retirement from the Noyon Salient had not diminished the fighting power of the German infantry. The divisions involved had mostly got warning orders to the attacking regiments by on 14 April which left them little time to prepare and late changes took until late in the evening to arrive. The 3rd Guard Division took over the left of the 2nd Guard Division around Pronville. Bottlenecks delayed many of the troops as they moved forward to assemble for the attack. Reserve Infantry Regiment 91 due to attack on the right flank from north of Qu√©ant towards Noreuil, took too long to reach its start line and attacked nearly an hour late. Attack =4th Ersatz Division= The 4th Ersatz Division attacked with four battalions, and the brigade commander, von Mechow retaining the and III , IR 361 as a reserve under his command. The advance ran into trouble as soon as it began, German artillery firing short; a flare signal warning the artillery was fired but went unnoticed and the signal was repeated, which silhouetted the advancing troops. The second and third waves hurried forward to escape the German bombardment and bunched up and Australian posts were encountered far in advance of the positions that were thought to be occupied, the recent move forward of the Australian outpost line having gone undetected. Australian small-arms fire was sufficient to stop the German advance; soon after dawn another two companies went forward to plug a gap in the centre of the attack but German artillery-fire failed to suppress the rifle and machine- gun fire from the Australian infantry and at the attacking troops were ordered to retire. The German infantry retirement, with eleven Australian prisoners, was untroubled and outposts were left on the right flank, south of the Bapaume‚ÄìCambrai road, covering the left flank of the 38th Division. =38th Division= Five battalions of infantry from the 38th Division attacked from the village of M≈ìuvres and return-fire from Australian outposts caused the attacking waves to merge, the third wave suffering severe casualties from machine-gun fire. Some troops claimed to have entered the north end of Demicourt and the eastern fringe of Boursies, which changed hands several times. At news arrived of the success of the attack beyond the right of the divisional flank and the division was ordered to attack Louveral along with the 3rd Guard Division. Just before news arrived that the 3rd Guard Division was in Louveral park and the 38th Divisional artillery was ordered to lengthen its range to beyond the village. After two hours the report was found to be false and a plan to attack the park at noon after another artillery preparation when reports arrived at that the advance of the divisions on either flank had been stopped with many casualties and that the 2nd Guard Reserve Division had been forced back to the . The division retired at without difficulty, claiming to have brought with it. =3rd Guard Division= The 3rd Guard Division attacked with the III, I and II , Lehr Regiment, on the right and the I, II and III , Guard Fusilier Regiment, on the left and Grenadier Regiment 9 in reserve to hold the . The three battalions on the left flank were echeloned (stepped back) to the left in case the 38th Division advance was stopped short. The Guards were on unfamiliar ground, having had no time for reconnaissance. Regiment Guard Fusilier had billeted back until nightfall on 14 April when it began its approach march in cold and stormy weather. During the attack the left and centre battalions surprised and overran posts of the 11th Australian Battalion but then ran into camouflaged machine-gun nests which had to be attacked. The process of reducing the Australian machine-guns was costly and even with reinforcements from the second wave the advance was halted. On the right flank of Regiment Guard Fusilier, the attack was stopped by the left flank company of the 11th Australian Battalion. On the right flank, the III crossed the path of a battalion of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division and was so badly delayed that it reached its assembly area an hour late. The regiment advanced at instead of its attack was spotted immediately and driven under cover except on the right. Some troops got into Lagnicourt with the 2nd Guard Reserve Division and retired at the same time, the left flank remaining until =2nd Guard Reserve Division= The infantry of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division ( ) knew the ground, having fought over it while retiring on the . Petersdorff dispensed with the preliminary hurricane bombardment due from to get the attackers into the Australian artillery positions before the alarm was raised. I RIR 91 (I/RIR 91) provided a flank guard to the north, I and III/RIR 77 attacked on the right and centre, with the I and III/RIR 15 on the left. The number of attackers, their knowledge of the ground and the silent approach succeeded and RIR 15 reported at that it had received only sporadic machine-gun fire. At RIR 77 sent a message that the spur between Noreuil and Lagnicourt had been captured with few losses and no artillery-fire from the defenders, RIR 15 occupying Lagnicourt at At I/RIR 77 attacked Noreuil up the valley of the Hirondelle stream and III/RIR 77 tried to capture the Australian artillery near the village. On the left flank, RIR 15 were surprised to overrun the Australian artillery in the Lagnicourt valley, thought still to be near Vaulx-Vraucourt, whose move had not been seen by German air reconnaissance. At about the German troops in the Hirondelle valley and the spur began to receive artillery-fire from the Australian guns west of Ecoust and at Morchies, directed by the crew of a British artillery- observation aircraft who flew over the battlefield at very low altitude. The increasing quantity of artillery-fire stopped the German advance by and reports arrived that RIR 15 was withdrawing, followed by the artillery- observation aircraft. The regiment was ordered to recapture the spur at about but the commanders of III/RIR 77 and I/RIR 15 had conferred on the Noreuil‚ÄìLagnicourt road and decided to withdraw. The 9th Company RIR 77 had advanced towards Noreuil over the spur and was cut off but the rest moved back under artillery- and machine-gun fire to a line about in advance of the , which was under severe bombardment, until when the troops returned to their positions behind a line of outposts; the bombardment died down and the troops in the outposts returned by The division claimed to have demolished 22 guns, damaged another eleven and taken 283 prisoners as pioneers blocked wells in Lagnicourt by detonating demolition charges not blown when the village had been captured on 26 March. Paperwork showing the dispositions of the 1st Australian Division were also recovered. =1st Australian Division= At a sentry alerted a post of the 3rd Australian Battalion, 1st Australian Brigade which opened rapid fire with Lewis guns and rifles and repulsed the troops of the 4th Ersatz Division but moments later all the posts on about were attacked. The German troops were visible in the glare of their flares and were shot down or forced to retreat. On the left flank, the 4th Australian Battalion similarly repulsed attacks by the 38th Division but lost a post on the road east from Demicourt to a attack and posts around the Bapaume‚ÄìCambrai road were forced to retreat. Counter-attacks failed but the troops in Boursies held on with reinforcements. A post in a chapel about east of Boursies was subjected to a determined attack but survived and the brigade commander boldly sent two companies from Beaumetz to reinforce the 3rd Australian Brigade to the north, which was under attack by part of the 38th Division and the 3rd Guard Division. The attack on the 3rd Australian Brigade had begun with a hurricane bombardment at the 11th Australian Battalion on the right repulsed a frontal attack but German troops pressed forward along a gully on the Australian right and attacked the posts one by one from front and behind. The post garrisons fought on and gained time for a reserve company and the reinforcements from the 10th Battalion to form a line from the original position, bending back to the 4th Australian Battalion north of Boursies. The left flank of the 12th Australian Battalion was attacked first and the right flank about an hour later and easily repulsed the Germans but as the sun rose many troops of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division could be seen south of Lagnicourt. The left flank company of the 12th Australian Battalion and the right of the 17th Australian Battalion (5th Australian Brigade, 2nd Australian Division) were overrun without the warning of a preliminary bombardment. The German infantry rushed Lagnicourt and in places advancing Germans and retreating Australians moved in parallel in the twilight. =2nd Australian Division= Only the 17th Australian Battalion of the 5th Australian Brigade, 2nd Australian Division was involved in the attack and was pushed back to the Bullecourt‚ÄìLagnicourt road and then a trench further back covering Noreuil. The German infantry had captured four batteries of the II Australian Field Artillery Brigade at Lagnicourt and three of the I Australian Field Artillery Brigade further west. The Germans were within of another battery at Maricourt Wood and nine batteries south-west of Noreuil were also in danger. Two companies of the 12th Australian Battalion took over a sunken part of the Lagnicourt‚ÄìBeaumetz road, about south of Lagnicourt and fought back-to-back against attacks from north and south. On the road to Beugny the HQ of the 12th Australian Battalion held its ground until reinforced. By the centre and left flank artillery groups of the division barraged Lagnicourt and Noreuil and the heavy guns of the 1st Anzac Corps ignored the danger of being captured and continued to fire. Australian resistance prevented the Germans debouching from Lagnicourt to the south or south-east. The commander of the 5th Australian Brigade secured Noreuil, a ridge between it and Noreuil and higher ground near Bois de Vaulx. The 19th Australian Battalion at Noreuil and the ridge was just in time to defeat an attack from Lagnicourt and another up the valley of the Hirondelle Stream. The 20th Australian Battalion made a careful advance from Vaulx Vraucourt and reached the Morchies‚ÄìNoreuil road by As soon as it was light, the Germans in the salient from Lagnicourt to south of Noreuil had come under fire from three sides and the 9th Australian Battalion began the Australian reply. The 20th Australian Battalion attacked soon after as did the 19th Australian Battalion around Noreuil as soon as the barrage was lifted. Many of the German troops surrendered and others shot while retreating. Reports from a reconnaissance aircraft led to every gun in range bombarding the Hindenburg Line wire to catch German troops as they returned. Lagnicourt was quickly recaptured and found that only five field guns and a howitzer had been destroyed. Others had explosive charges on them but these had not been detonated, despite the Germans occupying the village for about two hours (the Germans who got back claimed 22 guns destroyed). German covering posts from Lagnicourt to Demicourt returned at dusk. Aftermath =Analysis= In 1933 Charles Bean, the Australian official historian, wrote that 23 infantry battalions and attached storm troops, amounting to 16,000 men, had attacked 4,000 Australian troops, reached the objective in only one place and had soon been forced back, with about double the casualties that they had inflicted. Bean wrote that in his war diary (volume II, p.143 et seq.), Rupprecht had concluded that apart from the destruction of 22 guns had been something of a failure and cost about nine per cent of the attacking force. Rupprecht made no comment about the claim made by Moser that the attack had compelled the Australians to reinforce the area and OHL apparently did not believe that reduced the pressure at Arras. The only reserves that were moved after the attack were within the 1st Anzac Corps. German prisoners complained about the short notice of the attack and lack of time to reconnoitre, which was also noted in the divisional after-action reports read by Rupprecht. Moser called the operation the latest example of a big attack on the western front and that a memorandum was published containing a collation of the reports. The Germans had found that the Australian Lewis guns had been of great effectiveness, \\"cleverly emplaced and bravely fought\\" and many reports noted the need for a similar weapon. In 1939, the authors of volume XII of , the official history, wrote that the success of the attack was limited by the short notice and insufficient artillery support. The authors agreed with Moser that several days were necessary to arrange a night attack but disagreed that the situation at Arras was too dangerous to delay; the preparations could have been carried out over a longer period and been camouflaged to retain surprise. Jack Sheldon wrote in 2015 that the Fifth Army reacted to the attack by consolidating its positions in the area as quickly as possible. That the Australians had been surprised and that their artillery had been vulnerable led to more advanced posts being established and many more clashes between patrols in no man's land. =Casualties= In The Fifth Army (1931 [1968]), Hubert Gough wrote that about were killed and taken prisoner. In 1939, the historians of the wrote that the attackers inflicted took nearly and four artillery batteries had been overrun but only five guns were destroyed. The attack was described as a costly success, the German suffering and losing Most of the casualties came from well-positioned machine-guns and because some troops attacked late and were impeded by marshy ground, one battalion being delayed so badly that it attacked at dawn. In the Australian Official History volume IV, The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1917 (1933 [1982]) Charles Bean wrote that the attackers suffered the 2nd Guard Reserve Division, the 3rd Guard Division, the 38th Division and the 4th Division; the Australians took Bean wrote that the German divisions exaggerated their bag of prisoners, the 2nd Guard Reserve Division claiming The 1st Anzac Corps suffered of which suffered by the 1st Australian Division and the 2nd Australian Division; a minimum of were taken prisoner. Cyril Falls, the British official historian, wrote in the History of the Great War (1917 part I, 1940) that the 2nd Guard Reserve Division suffered more than the greatest loss among the divisions involved. In The Blood Tub (1998 [2000]), Jonathan Walker wrote that the Australians suffered more than and the loss of five artillery pieces, inflicting on the attackers. =Subsequent operations= The front of the 27th Division was quiet on 15 April but 16 April was a fine spring day and bombardments from artillery up to fell on the area, indicating that another attack was likely. Grenadier Regiment 123 moved into line between Infantry Regiment 120 and Infantry Regiment 124 and the right flank of the 2nd Guard Reserve Division closed up to IR 124, narrowing the regimental frontages and increasing the depth of the defence. The regiments had four companies in the front line, two in close support and two in reserve in the ; the 1st Company, equipped with light machine-guns, reinforced the infantry. Resting units only moved back and were kept busy repairing defences and digging more reserve positions at night. An attack was anticipated on a line from Bullecourt to Riencourt and Qu√©ant because of the extent of British artillery-fire and strafing attacks by British aircraft. German artillery replied with harassing and destructive bombardments which, at dawn every day, were directed at assembly areas and jumping-off lines.

It is part of the Cascade Range and overlooks Indian Henry's Hunting Ground. It is situated at the base of the Success Cleaver, south of South Tahoma Glacier, and southwest of Pyramid Glacier. The summit provides views of Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and peaks of the Tatoosh Range. Precipitation runoff from Pyramid Peak drains into Pyramid Creek, Tahoma Creek, and Fishers Horn Pipe Creek, which are all tributaries of the Nisqually River. History The descriptive name Pyramid Peak came from its pyramidal shape. An early writer described the peak as follows; \\"We had a better chance to observe Pyramid Peak in the morning light. It is in the form of a gigantic pyramid, perfect in outline. From a distance it appears to be black basalt, and on its sides no snow clings.\\"Mount Rainier National Park Place Names. Gary Fuller Reese (author), 2009. The name was officially adopted in 1913 by the United States Board on Geographic Names. The first ascent of this peak was made in 1915 by a Mountaineers party. Climate West aspect from Indian Henrys Hunting Ground Pyramid Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.

Wahlgren served as commanding officer of Gotland Military Command, as Chief of Home Guard and as Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Career Wahlgren was born on 14 May 1929 in √Ösele, V√§sterbotten, Sweden, the son of Eric Wahlgren, a forester, and his wife Ruth (n√©e Ellung). In 1953, Wahlgren was commissioned as an officer in the Swedish Armoured Troops and in the Scanian Dragoon Regiment (Sk√•nska dragonregementet, P 2) in H√§ssleholm with the rank of F√§nrik. He completed the staff course at the Swedish Armed Forces Staff College from 1963 to 1965 and was appointed Captain of the General Staff Corps. Over the next few years, he alternated between various staff and squad postings. During the years 1967-1968 he was educated at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth. From 1970 to 1975 he served in the Southern Military District Staff and studied at the Swedish National Defence College. Wahlgren received his first position in the United Nations in 1974-1975 as battalion commander of the Swedish Battalion 56M in the Middle East, which was part of the Second United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF II). He was head of course for UN education from 1976 to 1979 and served in North Scanian Regiment (P 6) from 1975 to 1977. Wahlgren was promoted to Colonel in 1977 and served in the years 1977-1980 as a defence attach√© in Oslo and during that same year also as head of the UN Staff Officers Course in Str√§ngn√§s. In 1980, Wahlgren began an era as commanding officer of Gotland Regiment (P 18) and this for a longer period. In 1983 he was promoted to Major General and commander of Gotland Military Command. Wahlgren established himself well in the Gotlandian environment and became an esteemed interpreter for Gotlandian defence and voluntary movement. He had at the same time gained a good international experience. In 1988, however, it was time to leave Gotland. Wahlgren served as Chief of Home Guard from 1 April 1988 to 30 September 1988 but the posting was short-lived as he was promoted to Lieutenant General, and appointed Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Wahlgren succeeded Lieutenant General Gustav H√§gglund on 1 July 1988. Wahlgren led UNIFIL at the time when the Lebanese Civil War finally ended after fifteen long years with a peace agreement signed in the Saudi Arabian city of Ta'if in August 1990. Wahlgren succeeded General Satish Nambiar as Force Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on 3 March 1993. From the headquarters in Zagreb, he came to command one of the largest and most expensive and most complex UN missions ever. The force numbered about 14,000 men from 21 nations. He made a remarkable effort there in a worrying situation. A difficult job, he faced questions of political significance, which had to do with national considerations in the UN mission. On Wednesday, 23 June 1993, however, Wahlgren's time in Yugoslavia ended after a game at a high political level where he was replaced by the French general Jean Cot. However, Wahlgren received strong praise from UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for his efforts in Yugoslavia. Wahlgren, who throughout his career carried with him a clear West Bothnian dialect, became one of Sweden's most internationally oriented officers. He reached the high positions and was involved in various assignments even after his retirement. From 1995, he was one of the eight senior officers from various countries who were members of the International Defence Advisory Board, created at the request of the Defence Ministers of the three Baltic states to provide independent expert advice on defence matters. He was also engaged by UNESCO on issues that had to do with the protection of cultural heritage in war situations, an issue that had been extensively raised during the Bosnian War. He presented his visions of the possibilities of the United Nations in his publication FN:s insatser f√∂r fred mot √•r 2000 (1994). Personal life In 1957, Wahlgren married Gunilla Margaretha Granlind (born 1933), the daughter of banker Harald Granlind and Hildur (n√©e Anderfelt). They had two daughters, Susanne and Monica.

He was a notable supporter of the Humanitarian League. After his death, he was memorialized by a statue in Newcastle upon Tyne. Life and work Coulson was a member of a landowning Northumberland family, most of whose country estates were sold in 1876 to Edward Joicey. Between 1877 and 1880, he had Blenkinsopp Castle, a disused property dating originally to the 14th-century, renovated in Victorian style. Blenkinsopp Castle was later sold to Joicey. For some years, he owned and resided at the nearby Blenkinsop Hall estate.Blenkinsopp History He served in the army from 1860 to 1892, attaining the rank of colonel. After retiring from the army, he became a magistrate and served on the boards of many charities concerned with the welfare of children and animals. Described by Henry S. Salt as \\"one of the first men of standing who lent their support to the Humanitarian League\\", he chaired its first public meeting. Coulson visited schools throughout England, lecturing about the importance of kindness to animals. In the 1890s, he participated in the Humanitarian League's campaign against otter hunting, which he characterized as \\"a brutal, demoralizing amusement\\". He wrote letters on the subject to local, regional and national newspapers and contributed an article on \\"The Otter-Worry\\" to a Humanitarian League pamphlet about blood sports. Among his other publications were a pamphlet on the horse and Musings on Moor and Fell, a book of local and natural history. After Coulson's death, in 1911, Henry S. Salt stated that \\"no one has done nobler service in a more unassuming way than Colonel Coulson [for the cause of animal welfare]\\". Memorial statue The Coulson memorial Soon after Coulson's death, in 1911, the First Secretary to the British Embassy in Paris, George Graham, proposed the building of a memorial in Newcastle upon Tyne. He volunteered to donate ‚Ç§300 toward the project, which he suggested should be a drinking trough for cattle with a portrait medallion of Coulson. A Memorial Fund Committee was struck to raise the necessary funds. The committee determined that the memorial should be erected in the Haymarket. It was unveiled by the Lord Mayor on 27 May 1914. In 1950 the memorial was moved to its present location on the junction of Horatio Road and City Road overlooking the Quayside and the River Tyne. It is a Grade II listed structure. The memorial consists of a double life size bronze portrait bust of Coulson on a concrete and stone pedestal which in turn stands on a pink granite base with drinking troughs - one for cattle and horses and the other for dogs - at the front and back. The bronze bust was sculpted by Arnold Rechberg and cast by the Rudier Foundry in France. The pedestal is inscribed on the front: \\"William Lisle Blenkinsopp Coulson, 1841‚Äì1911. Erected by public subscription in memory of his efforts to assist the weak and defenceless among mankind and in the animal world.\\" On the back of the pedestal is inscribed a quotation from Coulson: > What is really needed is an all round education in the higher impulses, true > manliness and womanliness, justice and pity. To try to promote this has been > my humble but earnest endeavour and until they are more generally aroused > the legislature is useless, for it is the people who make the laws.

Three years later he had developed an amplifier prototype using the technology. Calmel was later joined by Quentin Sanni√©, Emmanuel Nardin when he launched Devialet in Paris in 2007. Sanni√© served as the company's CEO with Calmel as CTO. It was in 2010 that the company introduced its first product, an amplifier called \\"D-Premier.\\" In 2010 and 2011, the company raised ‚Ç¨2.9 million ($4.1 million) in funding from around 80 individual investors. In November 2012, it was announced that the company had raised an additional ‚Ç¨15 million ($19 million) from an investor group led by Xavier Niel (Free), Jacques-Antoine Granjon (Vente-privee.com), Bernard Arnault (LVMH), and others. In June 2013, the company unveiled an updated version of its D-Premier amp changes (known as the Devialet 240) and two new lower-end versions, the Devialet 110 and Devialet 170. In late 2014, the company announced the release of its first speaker, the Devialet Phantom. The speaker was made available in Europe in early 2015. In June 2015, it raised ‚Ç¨17.5 million ($20 million) in another round of funding led by previous investors. The purpose of this funding round was to bring the Phantom to the United States market. In June 2016, the company released an upgraded \\"Gold Phantom\\" speaker with 4,500 watts of power that was capable of producing sound volumes of up to 108 decibels. Later that year, it announced an \\"Immersive Theater System\\" that would make use of several Gold Phantoms. Devialet continued updating their line of amplifiers (now known as \\"Expert\\"), and in late 2016 it introduced the Expert PRO amplifier as a high-end option. The company also opened an outlet store in New York City. In November 2016, Devialet raised ‚Ç¨100 million ($106 million) in a funding round led by Ginko Ventures, Foxconn, Jay-Z's Roc Nation, Andy Rubin's Playground Global, Groupe Renault, the Sharp Corporation, and Korelya Capital among others. In July 2017, Devialet announced a partnership with the British-based media company Sky, to create a sound system called the \\"Sky Soundbox.\\" In October, it entered into a 10-year agreement with the Paris Opera to build a \\"sound discovery room\\" in the Palais Garnier. In November 2017, the company released an upgraded version of the original Phantom. The following month, it announced another partnership, this time with Renault to create a car audio system. It also demonstrated a prototype system in Renault's Symbioz concept car. In March 2018, Quentin Sanni√© stepped down as the company's CEO and was replaced by Frank Lebouchard, a move that had been planned months in advance. In October of that year, it announced the Phantom Reactor speaker. As of 2018, the company maintains 160 patents for its technologies. In November 2019, Devialet partners with Huawei and unveiled a new specifically designed speaker, the Sound X. In January 2020, Devialet team up with Belkin for a new hi-fi smart speaker/wireless phone charger, named the SOUNDFORM ELITE. Products Devialet Phantom speaker from 2015. The Devialet produces a range of wireless speakers called \\"Phantom\\" along with a range of amplifiers known as \\"Expert Pro.\\" The Phantom line is separated into two ranges, Phantom Premier (with 3 models) and Phantom Reactor (with 3 models). All current Devialet devices are equipped with a variety of technologies, most notably, Analog Digital Hybrid (ADH). ADH combines elements of analog amps (Class-A) and digital amps (Class-D) allowing for larger wattage and decibel peaks. Heart Bass Implosion (HBI) is a technology that provides broader coverage of low-frequency sounds and mimics the properties of a subwoofer. Speaker Active Matching (SAM) is a signal processing mechanism that analyzes and adjusts sounds in real time to \\"reproduce the exact acoustic pressure recorded by the microphone.\\" The Active Co-Spherical Engine (ACE) refers to the spherical shape of some Devialet devices (namely, the Phantom speakers) is an acoustic architecture designed to deliver sound in every direction. They collaborated with Free to equip their TV set-top box with Devialet speakers.

It was produced by Martin Terefe and recorded at Kensaltown Recording Studios in London. The band's transition into the pop rock genre is still evident in \\"History of Violence\\", and has been associated with lead singer Tyler Connolly's piano-playing ability, which forced a change in songwriting style and was acquired prior to the recording of their sixth record, Wake Up Call (2017). \\"History of Violence\\" marked the group's fourth single to top the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart in the United States, and appeared on the Billboard Canada Rock, Rock Airplay, and Hot Rock Songs charts as well. \\"History of Violence\\" was written by Connolly and ex-wife Christine Connolly, and was released alongside its music video on September 25, 2019, as the lead single from Say Nothing, serving as an instant download on pre-orders of the album. The song's lyrics address the topic of domestic violence with the band encouraging their fans to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline should they or someone they know need assistance or guidance in dealing with domestic abuse. Recording and release \\"History of Violence\\" was produced by Martin Terefe and recorded at Kensaltown Recording Studios in London in 2019.Recording dates for Say Nothing: Say Nothing is the second album in which the band collaborated with the Swedish music producer with the first time being their previous studio album, Wake Up Call, released in 2017. The single was mixed by Neal Avron and Scott Skrzynski, while engineering was done by Clem Cherry and Jorge Arango Kure. The single was released alongside its music video on September 25, 2019; the same day, Theory of a Deadman announced the name of their pending album. It was included as an instant download with pre-orders of Say Nothing.  Composition and lyrics  The lyrics of the single‚Äîwritten by lead singer and primary songwriter Tyler Connolly along with ex-wife Christine Connolly‚Äîdiscuss the topic of domestic violence and was greatly inspired by the #MeToo movement. Tyler spoke of the song, \\"'History of Violence' tells the sad story of a girl trapped in a life of domestic abuse, leaving her with what she feels is the only way to escape. Even though she's in jail, it's still a better place to be than being imprisoned in real life by this man.\\" The chorus, initially written about a different topic, was composed first. The subject of domestic abuse was later established as the remaining lyrics were penned, with the assistance of Christine; Tyler acknowledged and appreciated the perspective of a woman and being the member of an all-male band, felt compelled to release a song in an effort to help women. The band has encouraged those who are, or know of someone who is, experiencing domestic violence to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. For their 2020 tour while promoting Say Nothing, the band supported domestic violence groups by partnering with Plus1, an organization that takes US$1 from each concert ticket sold and donating it to a charity of the band's choosing. Commercial performance \\"History of Violence\\" peaked at number 15 on Billboard's Canada Rock chart on January 3, 2020. In the United States, the track spent a total of 23 weeks on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and peaked at number one, making it the band's fourth single to top this chart, after \\"Bad Girlfriend\\", \\"Lowlife\\", and \\"Rx (Medicate)\\". The song also made an appearance on the Rock Airplay and Hot Rock Songs charts, climbing to positions 13 and 15, respectively. Music video The music video for \\"History of Violence\\" premiered on September 25, 2019, via Theory of a Deadman's official YouTube account. It was directed by Sam Sulam and produced by Eric Cook for Psycho Films, and was filmed in September 2019 in northern Los Angeles County, with some scenes being shot at Mira Loma Detention Center (a women's prison located in Lancaster, California). Its narrative focuses on the story of a woman enduring the abusive behavior of her husband; after shooting and killing him, she is sentenced to prison, which ultimately leads her to a feeling of freedom. Connolly stated, \\"We wanted to have a video that not only reflected the lyrics of the track but also left the viewer feeling like there's something they can do if they've been affected by something like this.\\" The video does not include an appearance by any of the band members, with guitarist Dave Brenner describing it as a \\"mini movie\\" and Connolly emphasizing the need for viewers to focus on the woman and her story, rather than the band.

Early life Whitney was born in Conway, Massachusetts on September 25, 1784, the ninth child of Jonathan Whitney (1737‚Äì1792) and Esther (n√©e Parkhurst) Whitney (1741‚Äì1812). Among his siblings was Nathan Whitney, Joel Whitney, Jonas Whitney and Ami Whitney. His paternal grandparents were Jonathan Whitney and Lydia (n√©e Jones) Whitney, who lived in Mendon, Massachusetts, and his maternal grandparents were Jonas Parkhurst and Abigail (n√©e Bigelow) Parkhurst. In 1789, his father moved his family from Massachusetts to Ontario County in Western New York, where he died three years later in 1792. Career In 1810, Whitney came to Niagara to operate a mill owned by New York State Assemblyman Augustus Porter, brother of Peter Buell Porter (who later served as United States Secretary of War from 1828 to 1829). Like Porter, Whitney was a land surveyor and, reportedly \\"made the first survey of Goat Island and made other surveys for the Holland Land Company and for the State of New York.\\" During the War of 1812, he was commissioned by Governor Daniel D. Tompkins as a Captain in the 163rd Regiment of the New York State Militia. During the Battle of Queenston Heights when he was serving under Gen. Winfield Scott, he was taken prisoner for a short period. On the morning of December 19, 1813, Whitney and his family were \\"driven from their home when the British marched from Lewiston to Tonawanda burning everything in their path.\\" They eventually returned in 1814, and began leasing the Eagle tavern, which he later purchased from Augustus Porter and Peter Barton in 1817. On June 19, 1820, Gov. DeWitt Clinton made him a Brigadier general of the 5th Brigade, followed by Major general of the 24th division on March 4, 1826. In 1831, he purchased and ran Cataract House (originally built in 1825), which became \\"the most elegant and popular hotel on the American side.\\" Whitney and his son accompanied Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, who had given a speech at Eagle Tavern, to Lockport, New York to witness the opening of the Erie Canal in June 1825 during Lafayette's visit to the United States. After his tour, the Marquis sent him an elaborate chandelier to be used in the hotel. Cataract House was host to Abraham Lincoln, Jenny Lind, Horace Greeley, William Seward, Franklin D. Roosevelt, King Edward VII (when he was the Prince of Wales), and King George V in 1939. In 1848, Whitney served as the inaugural Village President of Niagara Falls. Personal life In 1805, Whitney was married to Celinda Cowing (1783‚Äì1860), the daughter of Sarah (n√©e Randall) Cowing and Jabez James Cowing, who served with the Massachusetts Militia in the Revolutionary War. Between 1809 and 1817, they were the parents of six children, two of whom died as children; two sons and four daughters: * Asenath Beecher Whitney (1809‚Äì1859), who married a Polish nobleman, Pierre (Piote) de Kowalewski. * Angeline Whitney (1812‚Äì1857), who married Dexter Ray Jerauld. * Sally Whitney (1814‚Äì1815), who died in infancy. * Solon Myron Napoleon Whitney (1815‚Äì1907), who built the Whitney Mansion in Niagara Falls.

Its objective is to promote research and knowledge sharing in the fields of infrastructure risk management, standards, financing, and recovery mechanisms. It was launched by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019. CDRI's initial focus is on developing disaster-resilience in ecological, social, and economic infrastructure. It aims to achieve substantial changes in member countries' policy frameworks and future infrastructure investments, along with a major decrease in the economic losses suffered due to disasters. History CDRI was first proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the 2016 Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held at Vigyan Bhavan, New Delhi. Modi's \\"experience in dealing with the aftermath of the 2001 Gujarat earthquake\\" as the chief minister led him to the idea. The CDRI was later conceptualised in the first and second edition of the International Workshop on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (IWDRI) in 2018-19, which were organized by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of India, in partnership with the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, and the Global Commission on Adaptation. Cabinet approval PM Modi approved the proposal for CDRI on 13 August 2019, after which it was approved by the union cabinet on 28 August 2019. The Government of India also pledged financial support of towards the CDRI corpus. It also specified that the financial resources required for research purposes will be met through the existing budget of Ministry of AYUSH's National Medicinal Plants Board. The NDMA Headquarters at Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi was decided as the site for the interim secretariat of the CDRI. NDMA was also given the task of preparing CDRI's memorandum and by-laws. Design competitions for the CDRI logo and tagline were also organized on the MyGov.in portal with cash prizes of and respectively. Members As of March 2020, the CDRI comprises 15 member countries and three \\"knowledge and development partners.\\" Members: * Afghanistan * Australia * Bhutan * Fiji * Germany * Italy * Indonesia * India * Japan * Mauritius * Maldives * Mongolia * Nepal * Sri Lanka * United Kingdom * United States Knowledge and development partners: * UNDRR * UNDP * World Bank Launch Modi officially launched the CDRI at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September 2019. He termed it as a \\"practical approach and roadmap\\" towards climate change mitigation, adding that \\"an ounce of practice is worth more than a ton of preaching.\\" Twelve countries participated in the launch event alongside India: namely Australia, Bhutan, Fiji, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Maldives, Mexico, Mongolia, Rwanda, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom. The World Bank and the Green Climate Fund also supported the launch. Syed Akbaruddin, India's Permanent Representative to the UN, said that India wants to leverage its ability to convene geographically and economically diverse nations to \\"work across the board and to bring to the table a group of countries who are ready to address issues of infrastructure.\\" The Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori, termed CDRI as a \\"transformative initiative\\", adding that disaster- resilient infrastructure is \\"critical\\" to significantly reduce economic losses. She also mentioned that such recurring losses weaken poverty eradication and sustainable development efforts. The Indian Government and the UNDRR co-hosted an event called \\"Resilient Infrastructure: Key to the Success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\\", where the Indian Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar, said that the CDRI is an \\"initiative that brings together developed and the developing countries, small island states, landlocked countries, countries with advanced infrastructure systems, and countries with large infrastructure deficits.\\" Diplomatic significance The CDRI is the second major coalition launched by India outside of the UN, the first being the International Solar Alliance. Both of them are seen as India's attempts to obtain a global leadership role in climate change matters, and were termed as part of India's stronger branding by India's Minister of External Affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, at the fourth Ramnath Goenka Lecture in November 2019. While giving an interview to the India Today, he cited them to prove India's \\"much greater willingness to engage multiple players\\" under Modi's leadership. Sreeram Chaulia, dean of the Jindal School of International Affairs at the O. P. Jindal Global University, said that India and Japan, with their joint experience in disaster management, can use the CDRI to provide a safer alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). However BRI is an infrastructure creation and funding initiative unlike the CDRI, which is an international knowledge platform.

She entered service on 6 October 1917, but was mined and sunk off Latvia on 29 October 1917. The ship was salvaged by Latvia and entered service with the Latvian Navy on 10 November 1921 under the name Virsatis. She was taken over by the Soviet Navy in August 1940 when the Soviet Union occupied Latvia in August 1940, serving as T-297 and was sunk by a mine on 2 December 1941. Design and construction The M1916 Type minesweeper was an improved and slightly enlarged derivative of the M1914 and M1915 Type minesweepers which Germany had built since 1914. They were fleet minesweepers, seaworthy enough to operate in the open sea, and proved to be successful and reliable in service. M68 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship had a design displacement of and a deep load displacement of . Two coal-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to two sets of 3-cylinder triple expansion steam engines, rated at , which in turn drove two propeller shafts. Speed was . 120 tons of coal was carried, sufficient for a range of at . As built, M68 had a main gun armament of two 8.8 cm (3.5 in) SK L/45 naval guns, while 30 mines could be carried. Armament in Latvian service was listed as two Canet guns and one 2-pounder (40 mm) gun in 1931. In Soviet service, the ship was armed with two 76.2 mm (3 inch) guns and two 45 mm guns, backed up by four 7.62 mm machine guns, and was rearmed in September 1941 with three 102 mm (4 inch) and two 37 mm guns, backed up with two 12.7 mm machine guns. The ship had a crew of 40 in German service, with a crew of 69 in Latvia service, and 66 in Soviet service. M68 was laid down early in 1917 at A. G. Neptun's shipyard in Rostock as yard number 382, was launched on 25 July 1917 and was commissioned on 6 October 1917. Service =Germany= M68 joined the 3rd Minesweeping half-flotilla of the 2nd Minesweeping Flotilla, operating in the Baltic. Her service with the Imperial German Navy was short, however, as she was sunk after striking a mine off Riga on 29 October 1917. =Latvia= In 1918, M68 was raised and taken to Riga for repair, but in January 1919 was seized by the forces of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic as they gained control of most of the country during the Latvian War of Independence. In May 1919, M68 changed hands again when Riga was captured by German Freikorps, and in July control of Riga passed back to the forces of the Latvian Provisional Government. With repairs complete, the ship was commissioned into the Latvian Navy as Virsaitis on 10 November 1921, serving as a guardship. In October 1939, Latvia was pressured into signing a Mutual Assistance Treaty with the Soviet Union, permitting the Soviets to base troops on Latvian territory, and in June 1940 the Soviet Union occupied Latvia, with Latvia formally being incorporated into the Soviet Union on 3 August 1940. As a result, the Latvian armed forces, including its Navy, became part of the Soviet armed forces. =Soviet Navy= As part of this process, Virsaitis joined the Soviet Baltic Fleet on 19 August 1940 as a minesweeper, and was renamed T-297. Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. T-297, which was redesignated as an escort vessel on 25 July 1941 (returning to the name Virsaitis), was used to defend naval bases and communication routes. From 31 October 1941, the Baltic Fleet carried out a series of convoy operations to evacuate the garrison of the Hanko Peninsula, which the Finns had been forced to lease to the Soviets for use as a naval base following the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, but was now besieged. Virsaitis took part in the fourth evacuation convoy on 24 November 1941 and the final operation, which left Hanko on the evening of 2 December. Virsaitis struck a mine later that day and sunk.

It was designed by John Brookfield, who developed the system around 2006 in his backyard. Soon after its development, he taught the system to Special Forces, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Olympic wrestling team. Since then, the training system has increased in popularity and has expanded to mainstream gyms. A small study in 2015 showed that a 10-minute workout with the ropes increased heart rate and energy expenditure. The ropes are thick and heavy so as to give significant resistance. With one battle rope per upper extremity, it works out each arm independently, overcoming strength imbalances. It also reduces orthopedic load on joints. There are numerous types of ropes used for this workout. The ropes have two standard diameters (25mm and 44mm) and three standard lengths (5m, 10m, and 25m). There are three common exercises that one can perform with battle ropes: the wave, slams, and pulls. The wave is where one makes a continuous wave with the ropes. Slams are similar to making the wave, except the rope is slammed each time. Pulls are when one pulls the rope towards oneself, either simultaneously or alternatively. There are a multitude of other exercises that work various muscles of the body. For instance, moving the ropes side to side will work out the hips and core to improve total body stability, whereas moving the ropes in circles will increase shoulder range of motion. A tire can be added to the end to increase resistance when pulling.

During Steve Trevor's convalescence, Hippolyta and Diana use the Magic Sphere to divine the nature of his arrival on the island. They look into the past and learn of Trevor's secret mission. Two Nazi agents named von Storm and Fritz hijacked an experimental robot plane and attempted to bomb an army airfield. Trevor heroically took control of the plane and drove the Nazis away. He was in pursuit of Fritz's fighter across the ocean, when he crashed on the island. After the goddesses of the Amazons, Aphrodite and Athena appear before her, Hippolyta decrees that an Amazon agent should be sent to the United States to aid the Americans in their fight against the Nazis. She holds a great tournament to determine which of her warriors should act as their good will ambassador. Diana wants to participate in the tournament, but Hippolyta forbids it. Diana disguises herself with a simple mask and enters the tournament anyway. She masters every competition and becomes one of two finalists to compete in the \\"Bullets and Bracelets\\" competition. Diana defeats her opponent, Mala, because she deflects all five bullets while Mala is unable to deflect the fifth bullet and is wounded in the arm; Diana then reveals her true identity to the crowd. Hippolyta agrees to allow Diana to travel to the United States. She provides her with a patriotic costume and bestows upon her the name of Wonder Woman.

Several days earlier, Nafaa had stated to Agence France Presse that \\"Sisi's desired image as Egypt's saviour from Muslim Brotherhood rule... has been completely dismantled.\\" Views =Egyptian political changes= In April 2014, Nafaa was seen by Al-Monitor as seeking a consensus between pro-Mohamed Morsi and pro-Abdel Fattah el-Sisi supporters. Nafaa stated that after Hosni Mubarak resigned, an opportunity to establish a \\"revolution\\" was missed when protesting groups and individuals allowed a military council to take power instead of themselves organising a council to discuss and implement the \\"demands of the revolution\\". Nafaa also held the Muslim Brotherhood, under Morsi's presidency, for having failed its \\"real chance to build a democratic system in which everybody can participate\\". He felt that the Brotherhood and political Islam should be \\"part of the political landscape, but they should not dominate the system\\". Nafaa proposed a \\"wise men\\" committee to state authorities with the aim of seeking compromise. Nafaa said that \\"third parties\\" were treated by the media of constituting sleeper cells associated with the Brotherhood and that he was accused of this by students. =Saudi‚ÄìUAE‚ÄìEgypt alliance= In June 2019, while the Transitional Military Council (TMC) held power in Sudan, and shortled after the 3 June Khartoum massacre, Nafaa argued that there exists a Saudi‚ÄìUAE‚ÄìEgypt alliance that \\"is coordinating counterrevolutions in the Arab world\\". He stated that travels by TMC leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to Cairo were aimed at helping the TMC control Sudan in a similar way to that of the security system in Egypt and to oppose Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Nafaa linked Egyptian support for the TMC to the fear that the Brotherhood would come to power in Sudan in a similar way to the election of Morsi to the Egyptian presidency following the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

Densely philosophical, the work is acknowledged as his international \\"breakout hit\\" after several locally successful short works, winning praise from critics, a mention, and an award. Still frame and Wittgenstein quotes from Metronome Synopsis A quote by Ludwig Wittgenstein appears onscreen accompanied by choral voices. It is morning. In a kitchen, an artist (Daniel Cockburn) sits at a table, still in pyjamas, pounding a regular beat on the table with his hand (144 beats per minute). The artist states in voice-over: \\"This will be my rhythm for the day\\", and he begins to beat his chest rather than the table. The artist is seen doing routine morning things while the beat and pounding continue. He goes outside and gets on a bus. The artist goes to a movie and later plays pool. All the while, his voice-over continues to speak rapidly, discussing mental patterns in life, language, rhythm, as well as determinacy and free will. He talks about Hollywood films that have inspired him, and appropriated clips begin to play one after the other along with the artist's own footage. He wonders how many of his daily thoughts are his own, as opposed to ideas coming from films or indeed the rest of his life experience. The artist returns home. He lies down and stops beating his chest, however the pounding continues. In voice-over, he says \\"Jesus, how much longer is this going to go on?\\" Another quote by Wittgenstein appears onscreen. A bell rings, and a bus sign appears flashing STOP REQUESTED. The end credits roll, accompanied by a cut-up remix of the music that played at the start. Cast Daniel Cockburn ‚Ä¢ The Artist Genre and influences A \\"densely philosophical film\\", Metronome is also darkly comic. Among many other films, Cockburn's work refers directly to the voice-over monologue from the film Fight Club, the Artist speaking in a flat monotone staccato similar to the narrating character portrayed by Edward Norton. Another \\"end-of-century, white-collar rebellion chic film\\" that appears in Metronome is The Matrix. Themes and interpretations =Rhythm and order= In many of his short works, Cockburn is especially interested in the rhythm of speech and singing. Metronome is ostensibly a video essay on rhythm and order, more specifically a meditation on the rhythm of the human body and its mathematics. Cockburn \\"sets out to prove that it's easier than you might think to keep the same beat all day.\\" That, at least, is Metronome's \\"conceptual starting point\\", the narrator's attempt to keep a steady beat for an extended period of time: \\"It's a \\"day in the life\\" movie, from breakfast to bedtime, with me pounding my own chest at 144 beats per minute in sync with a constant table-drumming on the soundtrack.\\" By the end of the film, it appears that the self-imposed repetition has become hellishly unbearable. Metronome is a \\"piece that you can almost dance to - almost.\\" One interpretation of this aspect of the film is that the Artist's fixation does not come from within himself; that Metronome is a critique of modern life. =The self and other minds= Like much of Cockburn's early work, the film arises from his own thoughts and self- analysis: \\"That's what my work's about. It's me trying to figure myself out.\\" Astria Suparak describes the self-portrayal as that of an underdog \\"with a feeble narcissism\\". At the same time, the film is also socially themed. Three years following the production of Metronome, in an interview with Mike Hoolboom, Cockburn said it was \\"all about a mind formed by the images of others.\\" > A[n]... insistent voiceover makes a fairly deterministic and despairing > relation between meter/order/loops and the experience of repetitive thought > patterns. ... The monologue acknowledges its debt to other monologue-based > movies I've seen (repeatedly, in many cases), and goes on from there to > speculate on how two decades of movie going has insinuated certain aesthetic > and ideological beats into the polyrhythm that is my psyche. =Anxiety in the digital age= Adam Nayman has remarked that many of Cockburn's short pieces express a form of technophobia. Cockburn states in the interview with Hoolboom that he is particularly perturbed by digital video: \\"Digital video scares the crap out of me, more so than film by a long shot.\\" A little later, he says: \\"Metronome alludes to the physical experience of life in a digital age; the/my body is presented as a thing stuck living out the mental loops of its controlling brain.\\" =Life and death= In a brief retrospective review, Norman Wilner notes that Cockburn has a singular way of talking about life and death: \\"In works like Metronome and The Impostor (hello goodbye), he considers life, death and dreams - and dreams about death - with a childlike fascination and an adult's sense of gravity.\\" Production =Background= By 2002, Daniel Cockburn had become established in Toronto as a maker of \\"engrossing, cerebral short video pieces\\". Cockburn released the following short works the same year: i hate video (a related work), IdeaL, You Are in a Maze of Twisty Little Passages, all Different, PSYCHO / 28 X 2, and Subteranea Gargantua (prelude). Like Metronome, many of these were commissions. Cockburn came to video after first working with Super 8, 16mm and linear video editing, and, as noted above, was uncomfortable with digital video as a medium on philosophical grounds: > Whatever you say about it, a film frame is an object which bears the > physical imprint of reality. A videotape is an object which bears an > analogically encoded imprint of reality. This is still somehow acceptable to > me ‚Äî but once you get into digital video, and the tape-object is merely a > carrier for various file formats, for language that humans will never be > able to comprehend (though they may have invented it), it seems somehow > heretical that we should think that the image and sound which spew out the > other end of this tape/computer actually embody a connection to reality. > Bearing a resemblance and embodying a connection are two different things. =Filming= The portions of Metronome made by Cockburn were shot in Toronto, such as the bus ride along Bathurst Street, referred to by name in the voice- over. Cockburn described how he conceived of making a video combining appropriated footage with his own. In Metronome, the appropriated footage is like a POV shot, while the video of himself is a reaction shot. \\"My voiceover, in connecting the two, fulfills the function that would in classical cinema be fulfilled by my eyeline. This might in fact be more subjective, since it's a shot-reverse-shot alternation motivated by the mind's eye rather than the retina's\\". Metronome was produced on video and completed in conjunction with a grant under the Charles Street Video \\"Home Show\\" Residency Program. =Post- production= Ryan Feldman was responsible for post-production, which took place at Charles Street Video, using After Effects. Release Metronome premiered at the 11th annual Moving Pictures Festival of Dance on Film and Video, in the Canada Dances section, Saturday 26 October 2002. It was shown at Canada House in London before the year was over. A year later, it was described as his \\"most successful\\" film to date, \\"spending 2003 touring festivals in the U.S. and Europe.\\" In 2004, Wendy Banks said the film was a \\"festival favourite\\". In 2005, Mike Hoolboom acknowledged it as Cockburn's \\"breakout hit\\", comparing the response it received it to James Benning's American Dreams (1984): \\"something of that shadow hung over Metronome, it was just so smart and hurting and funny.\\" A screening at the Rivoli Theatre, Toronto, in 2006 was preceded by a discussion by theoretical physicist Lee Smolin, who contributed to a catalogue for a curated programme of Cockburn's films (see below). =Anthology film= Beginning in 2009, Metronome began to be shown along with a selection of Cockburn's other films, under the collective title You Are In a Maze of Twisty Little Passages, All Different, the actual programme varying with the venue. =Home media= A 55-minute DVD (for exhibitions and educational institutions) of one version of the anthology film was released in 2009. Reception TIFF's Cameron Bailey =Critical response= Declaring Cockburn was \\"Toronto's best new video artist\\", Cameron Bailey stated that Metronome was \\"shockingly inspired,\\" mixing Wittgenstein, movies and pattern theory. Wendy Banks called the film \\"dizzying\\" and \\"worth the price of admission\\" to see it, \\"plus the cab ride\\". Glenn Sumi said it took absurdity to an extreme but his talent and idiosyncratic form of postmodernism was appealing: > Filmmaker Daniel Cockburn obsessively pounds his chest and speaks in an > intentional monotone, trying to locate the rhythmic beat of his life. We > never get to the bottom of the narrator's fixation on rhythm ‚Äî in film and > his daily life ‚Äî but Cockburn's a talented director with a sharp technique > and a clever pomo sensibility that's always engaging. James Missen of the Available Light Screening Collective in Ottawa said that in Metronome, Cockburn merges the aesthetics of his Toronto predecessors Mike Hoolboom and Steve Reinke \\"in order to weave a compelling tale of domestic routinization that is equal parts hilarious and heartening.\\" Hoolboom himself was impressed enough by the film that it is ranked in 18th place on his 2017 list of Top 111 Canadian films. Hoolboom wrote in 2005: Mike Hoolboom > He burst into my brain with Metronome, a movie that remixed an artist's > diary and found footage smarts in a meditation on the body's mathematics... > Superimposed on his heartbeat, which here is a stand-in for the inner > monologue, are pictures which arrive from elsewhere, secondary experiences > which storm the screen with an abyss of another kind: the promise of > pleasure without consequence.

The League was considered one of the key groups in the Neo- Jacobite Revival of the 1890s.  History  = The Jacobite Underground before 1860 = Jacobites support restoration of the House of Stuart to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Following the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745, Jacobitism was rigorously suppressed throughout Britain, and Jacobite sympathisers went underground, forming secret clubs and societies to discus their ideas in private. One prominent example was the \\"Cycle of the White Rose\\" usually known as the Cycle Club, which had been founded in 1710 by the Williams-Wynn family in North Wales. The Cycle Club continued to meet under the family's patronage until the 1860s. = The Order of the White Rose = In 1886, Bertram Ashburnham circulated a leaflet seeking Jacobite sympathisers, and amongst those who replied was Melville Henry Massue. Together they formed the Order of the White Rose, a Jacobite group that was the spiritual successor to the Cycle Club. The Order was officially started on 10 June 1866. = Formation of the League = Ashburnham was principally interested in the artistic and cultural aspects of Jacobitism. He was president of the New Gallery in London, and in 1889 the gallery put on a major exhibition of works related to the House of Stuart, organized by Henry Jenner. Ashburnham persuaded Queen Victoria to lend a number of items to the exhibition, as did the wife of her son Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany and families with Jacobite sympathies and pasts from England and Scotland donated items. The exhibition was a great public success and sparked a renewed interest in the Stuarts and the Jacobite cause. Several of the Order were displeased by the group's focus on art. They wanted to start a political movement with the aim of overthrowing the British monarchy and replacing it with the descendants of Charles I. In 1890, Vivian and Erskine co-founded a weekly newspaper, The Whirlwind that espoused a radically Jacobite political view. In 1891, unable to persuade Ashburnham of the merits of taking a political stance, key members of the Order left to form a new society, the grandly-titled Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland, led by Vivian, Erskine and Melville Henry Massue. Several other Jacobite and Legitimist societies formed in the early 1890s, and though serious in intent, they were widely greeted with amusement and disdain. = League actions = Rupprecht of Bavaria, who the League held to be the legitimate British king The league organised a number of protests and ceremonies. In late 1892, the League applied to the government for permission to lay wreaths at the statue of Charles I at Charing Cross on the anniversary of his execution. Permission was refused by Gladstone, but the League attempted to lay their wreaths anyway on 30 January 1893. Police were dispatched to stop the League; after a confrontation, members of the League led by Vivian were allowed to complete their ceremony. The League made the most of this conflict and obtained significant covered in the press, though much of it mocked them. The 1892 protest led to an annual wreath-laying event organised by the League, but in 1901, permission was refused. A question was asked in Parliament about this refusal, with Akers Douglas replying that: \\"on the 30th January last our late revered Sovereign was lying dead, and the special circumstances of this case seemed to require that, for this occasion, on grounds of good taste and feeling, the customary decoration should not take place\\" Massue was President of the League in 1893, 1894 and 1897. In 1891, the delegates of the Central Executive Committee of the League were: Walter Clifford Mellor, Herbert Vivian, George G. Fraser, Melville Henry Massue, the Baron Valdez of Valdez, Alfred John Rodway, R.W. Fraser. Mellor's wife, Lady Helen Clifford Mellor, attracted a measure of fame when on 19 June 1897, she greeted Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria at Victoria Station and presented him with a bouquet of white roses. Rupprecht was a descendant of Charles I of England and the claimant to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland in the Jacobite succession. = Vivian leaves = In June 1893, there was a split between Massue and Vivian, and Vivian attempted unsuccessfully to continue to League with the support of Viscount Dupplin, W. C. Mellor and others. Vivian left the League in August 1893, but continued to promote a strongly Jacobite political philosophy. = End of the League = In 1914, just after the start of the First World War, Prince Rupprecht appeared in German uniform in support of The Kaiser. Public sympathy immediately turned against the Neo-Jacobites, many supporters left, and the League ceased to exist shortly afterwards.  Beliefs  The League's principals and beliefs are well summarised in this quote from the 1910 Legitimist Kalendar: > The raison d'etre for the Jacobite party today is the maintenance of the > principle of the hereditary as opposed to the parliamentary right to the > throne of these realms. There is still a Representative of the elder line > living, and every day shows more and more clearly how now, when socialistic > and revolutionary doctrines threaten to overthrow all law and order, it is > necessary for the Sovereign to have some higher title to the throne than a > mere paper one that can be torn to shreds at any moment. It is in order to > teach the nation where to look for the Sovereign whose claim to govern is > derived from God alone, and to instill into men's minds a little of that > spirit of loyalty and chivalry which animated the hearts of so many good and > brave men and women in the past, to oppose the false and impractical ideas > of liberty and equality... that the Jacobite party exists today  Publications  The League published a number of books and newspapers, either directly or through its members. * The Legitimist Kalendar was published between 1891 and at least 1910, and summarised the key dates in Jacobite history and recorded the League's activities. * Theodore Napier, the Scottish secretary of the League, wrote a polemic titled The Royal House of Stuart: A Plea for its Restoration.

The bill passed its first reading on 24 September 2019 with the support of the Labour-led coalition government and its coalition partners New Zealand First and the Greens but was opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties. The bill passed its second reading on 19 February 2020 and its third reading on 18 June 2020 and receiving royal assent on 24 June 2020. Legislative features Key provisions of the Arms Legislation Bill include creating a national gun registry; strengthening the licensing regime to filter out \\"high risk\\" people and behaviour; creating an advisory group consisting of members of both the firearms and non-firearms communities; strengthening regulation over the importation, distribution, and manufacture of firearms and components; and introducing new offences and penalties. The Bill also amends several existing legislation including the Arms Act 1983, the Extradition Act 1999, the Intelligence and Security Act 2017, and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992. The Bill also reduces firearms licences from ten to five years. It also toughens penalties with people possessing a gun without a licence facing up to one year in prison or a NZ$15,000 fine, and people selling a gun to an unlicensed person facing a two year jail sentence or a $20,000 fine. Short (pistol-length) semi-automatic rifles have also been banned and pest control endorsements also have a shorter duration. People selling ammunition need to possess a firearms licence within six months. There are also new requirements for shooting clubs and ranges after two years. History =Background= Following the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019, the Labour-led coalition government introduced the Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019, which banned semi-automatic firearms, magazines, and parts. The Bill was supported by all parliamentary parties except the libertarian ACT Party's sole Member of Parliament David Seymour. The Government also introduced a gun buy-back scheme and amnesty. On 13 September 2019, the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Police Minister Stuart Nash announced that the Government would be introducing a second gun control bill later that month to combat the flow of guns into criminal gangs. The opposition National Party, which had obtained a leaked draft of the bill in August, and gun lobby groups claimed that the bill would unfairly target firearm owners and gun clubs. =First reading= On 23 September 2019, the National Party's police spokesperson Brett Hudson requested thirteen changes for the proposed gun bill including introducing firearms prohibition orders, introducing safeguards on health professionals reporting patients to the New Zealand Police, and providing flexibility for gun clubs, shooting rangers, and pest controllers. That same day, the Arms Legislation Bill passed its first reading. While the Labour, Green, and New Zealand First parties supported the bill, it was opposed by the National and ACT parties. =Second reading= On 19 February 2020, the Arms Legislation Bill passed its second reading by a margin of 63 to 57 votes. Labour, the Greens, and NZ First supported the bill while National, ACT, and independent MP Jami-Lee Ross opposed the bill. National MP Hudson attempted to introduce seven amendments that included removing the proposed gun register, exemptions and changes to the \\"fit and proper person test\\" relating to violent, hate speech, and extremism. ACT MP David Seymour also proposed amendments eliminating the gun register, new regulations on shooting clubs, and a provision for doctors to report on \\"dangerous\\" patients. These amendments were not accepted. In addition, the Council of Licensed Firearm Owners (COLFO) tried unsuccessfully to lobby NZ First into reversing their support for the bill. =Third reading= On 18 June 2020, the Arms Legislation Bill passed its third reading by a marging of 63 to 50 votes. Labour, the Greens, and NZ First supported the bill while National, ACT, and Independent MP Jami-Lee Ross opposed the bill. Only 48 National MPs voted since the others were absent due to COVID-19 flight disruptions. In return for support the bill's passage into law, Labour agreed to incorporate New Zealand First's proposal that an independent entity be established to take over firearms licensing and administration from the Police. In addition, the Bill also allowed members of the farming community, owners and managers of agricultural businesses to apply for endorsements to use prohibited firearms for pest control without having to establish a company to carry out the work. The opposition National and ACT parties, and the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) criticised the bill for allegedly penalising law-abiding gun owners. By contrast, the New Zealand Police Association supported the bill, saying that changes were long overdue. =Royal assent= The bill received royal assent on 24 June 2020 and commenced on 25 June 2020.

Early career  Berman was born in Andiranovka, Chita, Transbaikal Oblast, to a Jewish brickyard owner. At the age of ten, Boris Berman was sent to work as a shop assistant. He fought in the civil war as a teenager. He joined the OGPUin 1921 and held a succession of posts. In 1928-31, he was based in Russian Central Asia, and for about three years, was an OGPU resident in Germany. In 1934, he was appointed deputy head of the OGPU Foreign Department, shortly before it was reorganized as the NKVD.Who Directed the NKVD (in Russian), (select \\"–ë–ï–†–ú–ê–ù –ë–û–†–ò–° –î–ê–í–´–î–û–í–ò–ß\\")(in Russian), accessed 25 September 2019  Role in the Great Terror  When the NKVD was preparing the first of the Moscow Show Trials, by forcing confessions out of prisoners, Berman was the interrogator who induced the Old Bolshevik Vagarshak Ter-Vaganyan to sign a false confession and appear in the dock, telling him that he would be spared the death penalty. Ter-Vaganyan was shot, though it may be that Berman did not know what would be the outcome. During preparations for the second trial, he handled the interrogation of Karl Radek. When Nikolai Bukharin was arrested early in 1937, Berman led the team who searched his apartment. According to Bukharin's widow, Anna Larina: In May 1937, Berman was appointed head of the NKVD in Belorussia (Belarus). In this role, he is said to have been the first official to order his staff to use torture, and was \\"sadistic even by NKVD standards\\". His victims included a group of former high ranking communists, writers and poets, executed on 29‚Äì30 October 1937. In January 1938, he reported at a conference of regional NKVD chiefs that his staff had arrested 60,000 people over the previous eight months. Berman's mass killings in Belarus purposefully targeted the educated elite and representatives of Belarusian culture. Simultaneously, Berman supervised the Polish Operation of the NKVD in Belarus, in which over seventeen thousand people were sentenced to death, most of them Poles. Many of Berman's mass executions were large scale, and were carried out at the Kurapaty mass killing site.Snyder, Timothy. Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. Basic Books, 2010. p. 98 On December 19, 1937, Berman was awarded the Order of Lenin. In May 1938, he was promoted to head the NKVD Third Directorate. Still, he was arrested on September 24, 1938, in the same week that Lavrentiy Beria officially took control of the NKVD. Berman was executed on February 22, 1939, in Kommunarka, Moscow Oblast. He was not rehabilitated in 1956.  Family  Berman was the younger brother of Matvei Berman, who was head of the Gulag (the Soviet prison camps) in the 1930s. His wife, M.A.Bak, was also an NKVD official, and the sister of Boris Bak (1897-1938), who was head of the Middle Volga NKVD during the period when the peasants were resisting being forced onto collective farms. In January 1930, he oversaw the deportation of ten thousand families. He was head of the NKVD in the Northern Province until his arrest on 13 August 1937. He was shot in June 1938. Brother of Berman's wife M.A.Bak, Solomon (1902‚Äì40), also held senior NKVD posts in the regions until his arrest in October 1938 and execution on 19 January 1940.

Location The mouth of the Laval River is in Forestville, La Haute- C√¥te-Nord. Route 385 roughly follows the course of the river. The Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec does not have information about the name, which was made official on 5 December 1968. A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the Laval River in sub-region 5g-T of the east fir/white birch subdomain. Course The Laval River originates in Lac Septembre and flows generally southeast through Lac Roger, Lac Kinney, Lac Stanley and Lac Laval, which it enters at the southwest angle and leaves from the southeast end. The Lac Laval, from its mouth, is sometimes taken as the source of the river. The river then flows through Lac √âric and Lac Courdeau, then enters a flat- bottomed valley where it is fed by the Adam River, receives water from Lac MacDonald and Lac Madeleine, and then enters Lac √† Jacques. Below this lake, after some rapid sections, the river passes under Quebec Route 138 at Pont- Laval, near its mouth. The Laval River Rare Forest (For√™t rare de la Rivi√®re- Laval) is on the east side of the river between Lac √† Jacques and Route 138. It is unusual in including red pines (Pinus resinosa), which are very rare on the C√¥te-Nord. The river enters the Saint Lawrence in the Baie Laval just north of the community of Forestville. The Pointe Laval defines the southeast point of the bay, and the √éle Laval is in the mouth of the bay. The rate of flow of the river varies considerably, from slow to fast. The bed of the river is rather dark, the waters are not very clear, and some of the pools are black. After rain the river level and color change significantly. Fishing For many years Anglo Pulp and Paper, a paper mill, owned the fishing rights, until the government of Quebec made the river a wildlife reserve. The Forestville Hunting and Fishing Association was formed on 16 October 1968, and in 1978 became responsible for a reserve known as the Forestville ZEC (zone d‚Äôexploitation contr√¥l√©e: controlled use zone). The Association took over management of the Laval River in spring of 1980. The Forestville Hunting and Fishing Association now manages the River Laval ZEC. There are 67 salmon pools and 45 trout pools. Both the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and the sea trout (Salmo trutta) are plentiful and are much larger than average. The large Lac √† Jacques holds excellent northern pike (Esox lucius). In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and- release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, Aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec. In 2019 the Upper North Shore Watershed Agency (Organisme des bassins versants de la Haute-C√¥te-Nord) conducted inventories of the fish in the Laval River's tributaries. They had studied the spawning grounds of the river in 2018, and concluded there was no obstacle to the salmon run on one of the tributaries. Three more tributaries had been identified that could be accessible. By better understanding the streams used for reproduction by the Atlantic salmon they would be able to better protect the environment and thus protect the fish.

At the time the Constitution provided that: > XVIII. Any person holding any Office of Profit under the Crown, or having a > Pension from the Crown during Pleasure or for Term of Years, shall be > incapable of being elected, or of sitting or voting as a Member of the > Legislative Assembly, unless he be One of the following official Members of > the Government, that is to say, the Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer, > Auditor General, Attorney General, and Solicitor General, or One of such > additional Officers, not being more than Five, as the Governor, with the > advice of the Executive Council, may from Time to Time, by a notice in the > Government Gazette, declare capable of being elected a Member of the said > Assembly. Adolphus Taylor argued that the Governor had already issued five proclamations prior to the appointment of Suttor and thus the appointments of Suttor and Reid to the office of Minister for Public Instruction meant they were disqualified. The Elections and Qualifications Committee agreed, declaring that both Suttor and Reid held an office of profit under the crown and they were both disqualified from holding office. Result The Committee of Elections and Qualifications held that an error in the drafting of the constitution meant that George Reid could not be validly appointed Minister of Public Instruction and declared his seat vacant. Aftermath While Reid was defeated, Suttor was unopposed in the Bathurst by-election. The errors were remedied by the Constitution Act Amendment Act 1884. Reid did not regain a seat in Parliament until the October 1885 election.

She studied sculpture from 1962 to 1965 at the City Academy of Fine Arts in Maastricht. From 1965 to 1972 she was a teacher at Posterholt. She emigrated to New Zealand in 1976, where she made a name as a sculptor. For 25 years from 1990, she and her husband Paul van den Bergh lived in Timaru in two churches that they moved to the site and converted into a home and studio. In 2014 they moved to the Kapiti Coast. Windhausen and her husband have a number of children and grandchildren. thumb  Works  Close up of the Kate Sheppard National Memorial In the early 1980s she made a number of bronze portraits. She then received a number of commissions for monumental works, such as a bronze statue of the New Zealand boxer Bob Fitzsimmons, which was commissioned by New Zealand property magnate and boxing fan Sir Robert Jones, and which is located in a public square in Timaru.\\"Statue of Bob Fitzsimmons, Timaru\\", Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Retrieved 27 September 2019. Windhausen also made a two-metre high work of the sailing ships of Abel Tasman. This work was commissioned by the Netherlands-New Zealand Federation, and unveiled in Wellington on March 17, 1992 by Queen Beatrix. For the centenary of women's suffrage in New Zealand, she made the Kate Sheppard National Memorial, a bronze relief measuring five by over two metres. This work was unveiled on 19 September 1993. Windhausen's work also includes a statue of Captain John Hamilton which was installed in Hamilton's Civic Square. In 2018, the statue was vandalised by activist Taitimu Maipi. Maipi used a hammer and red paint to damage the statue, and said that it did not make sense to celebrate a man who murdered the ancestors of local MƒÅori. Windhausen said that \\"history is controversial and that's why I want to say I respect [Taitimu Maipi's] feelings for Captain Hamilton\\". Windhausen said her sculpture, to her, only went as far as illustrating where the name of the city came from. Further protests against the statue followed in 2020, including a march. The statue was removed from the square in June 2020 by Hamilton City Council.

At the time of her death, she was Professor Emerita of Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Bugental was awarded the 2003 Kurt Lewis Memorial Award from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues. Her award address titled Thriving in the Face of Childhood Adversity described her program of research on the experiences of children growing up with medical or physical disorders, their increased risk of parental neglect and/or abuse, and parental investments. Her other awards included the 1996 UC Presidential Award for Excellence in Supporting Undergraduate Research, and the 1997 Research of the Decade Award from the Santa Barbara County Health Care Services.  Biography  Bugental was born on January 31, 1928, in Santa Barbara, California. She attended the University of California, Los Angeles where completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1952 and Ph.D in Personality and Social Psychology in 1964. Bugental joined the Department of Psychology at University of California, Santa Barbara in 1974. She served as Area Head of Developmental and Evolutionary Psychology and Co-Director of the Interdisciplinary Program in Human Development. Bugental engaged in community leadership as part of the Steering Committee of The Family Partnership, a network of Santa Barbara agencies focused on child abuse prevention. She worked closely with the agency Child Abuse Listening and Mediating (CALM) for two decades. Bugental's research was funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health.  Research  Bugental's research program focused on parent-child relationships, especially those involving young children with medical conditions who were vulnerable to abuse. Much of her work focused on identifying family situations associated with heightened risk of child abuse. Her research team found that mothers who manifested a sense of powerlessness were more likely to demonstrate harsh or abusive tactics with ‚Äúat risk‚Äù infants. Bugental and her colleague Alex Schwartz conducted a randomized clinical trial aimed at preventing child mistreatment of medically at-risk infants. Families that received the cognitive intervention exhibited safer homes with decreased rates of corporal punishment and fewer reported incidents of child injury as compared to families that received home visitations without the intervention component.

From July until September 2019, David-West killed at least 15 women, mostly in the city of Port Harcourt. He was apprehended on 19 September 2019. He later confessed to a total of 15 murders. Early life David-West reportedly had a tough childhood. Several individuals who knew him claimed that he was an only child born into a polygamous household, but he and his mother lived separately from the rest of the family. He claims that his mother was poisoned and that as the only son of his father much was expected of him but he could not deliver. He claimed that he attended the branch of the Lord's Chosen Church in Obigbo, where he said that he confessed to the pastor that he had been killing women. The pastor reportedly invited him to a crusade prayer service to heal him. David-West was reportedly a member of the Greenlanders (also known as Deebham, or Dey Gbam), a mafia-styled street gang that sprung out of the armed militant groups that are notorious in Nigeria for engaging in criminal acts of violence and Voodoo. Murders Although David-West reportedly belonged to a criminal group, David-West told authorities that he had acted alone. =Modus operandi= In a confession, David-West claimed that he had \\"an irresistible urge to kill\\" and every night from June to his capture in September he scoured the streets for women in his vehicle. He would proceed to then go to a local hotel where he and the woman would eat, have sex, and then go to bed. In the middle of the night David-West would wake up the victim and threaten her with a knife. Before killing them he robbed them of money, ATM cards and other valuables. He would then turn the television or the radio on high volume, and using strips of cloth he had cut from the pillow cases, he would tie up the victim before manually strangling her. Victims were often found naked, bound with a white strip of cloth on their ankles, arms, and neck. He was arrested when on the early morning of 19 September 2019, a woman who had accompanied him to a hotel woke up to David-West tying her up and preparing to suffocate her. David-West and another individual from Kaduna State were arrested and charged with homicide. Trial He was due for arraignment on 22 October 2019 but the absence of his lawyer frustrated his arraignment However, when the case was called up the following day, David-West pleaded guilty to nine murder charges against him but pleaded not guilty to the charge of attempted murder of victim who survived his attack. Trial Judge, Justice Adolphus Enebeli adjourned till 18, 21, 27 and 29 November and 4 December 2019 for hearing and ordered that the suspect be remanded in prison custody. On 23 March 2020 he shocked people in Court when he denied he was the person in any of the images on front page of a newspaper and on a short CCTV video clip of him in a hotel with his alleged last victim, adding that he did not know what the prosecuting state counsel was talking about, since he had not committed any offence. The Judge allowed the video images to be admitted as exhibit, did not accept the copy of the newspaper and adjourned the matter to 27 March 2020 for continuation On 11 June 2020, the Judge gave 21 days to counsels involved in the murder trial to file in their written addresses and adjourned the suit to 29 July 2020 for adoption of written addresses. In August 2020, the presiding judge of the Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Justice Adolphus Enebeli fixed 9 October 2020 for the delivery of judgment on the murder charges leveled against David-West. In October 2020 David-West was found guilty of murder and attempted murder and was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Adolphus Enebeli.

In September 2019, Ali circulated videos accusing Sisi of corruption. The online circulation of videos snowballed, with others including Wael Ghonim joining in the anti-Sisi criticism. Ali called for mass anti-Sisi street protests which started on 20 September 2019 across Egypt. On 28 December 2019, Ali released the \\"Egyptian Consensus Document\\" with a list of four key principles and four key actions for replacing the Egyptian government, which he claimed represented the consensus of a wide range of the Egyptian opposition. Childhood and education Ali was born in Giza in 1978. According to Ali, he started work at the age of 15 in his father's gold shop in order to support his parents and siblings financially. He quit two years later, and tried \\"maybe 13 different jobs\\". Ali had earlier avoided military conscription and contact with the armed forces, worrying that he would have remained at a low rank because of his low grades, a lack of formal qualifications, and \\"a bit of a temper\\". Contracting career Ali started working as a contractor with Etisalat. He gradually came into closer and closer contract with senior army officials, including el-Sisi as defence minister in 2012. High-level military construction deals were, according to Ali, made by verbal deals, with no written contracts, and the expectation that construction would start immediately, without waiting for plans to be made. September 2019 videos Ali was privately critical of el-Sisi. Around 2017, Kamel el-Wazir, the head of the army engineering authority, obtained an audio recording of Ali mocking el-Sisi and other generals. Ali applied for residency in Spain and settled there with his family, completing the move in August 2018 with the end of his children's school term. Starting on 2 September 2019, Ali claimed on online social networks that he had worked in the construction industry for 15 years under army contracts, building five villas for colleagues of Sisi and a palace for Sisi in a military camp. Ali accused Sisi of wasting public funds and \\"[taking] low-level corruption to a new level\\". Ali's videos outline specific incidents and directly accuse well-known military individuals, including Major-Generals Kamel al-Wazir and Essam al- Kholy. Egyptian authorities ran a media campaign attacking Ali. According to Omar Said and Rana Mamdouh writing in Mada Masr, the governmental campaign \\"did not refute the substance of [Ali's] claims.\\" Videos by other Egyptians accusing Sisi of corruption started circulating and on 20 and 21 September, street protests started across Egypt. Ali is generally credited as the catalyst of the protests. On 20 September, Egyptian Streets described the protests as \\"small, scattered\\". On 21 September, Al Jazeera English estimated that \\"thousands\\" of protestors had participated in the previous day's protests in eight different Egyptian cities. =Surveillance in Spain= On 23 September 2019, Ali stated that \\"officers\\" had been following him in Spain for two weeks, and that he had been \\"hiding and running away from them\\". Ali stated that the officers wished to kill him and that he was too tired to \\"run any more\\". Ali stated that Spanish authorities were responsible for his safety and that if he were \\"killed in Spain,\\" then that would \\"[prove] that Europe is a liar just like the United States and is willing to give up anybody.\\" Political program Following the 20 September protests, Ali called for another protest of \\"a million\\" people on Friday 27 September. He proposed the replacement of the presidential system of government by a parliamentary system. He called for fifty people to be elected in each of the governorates of Egypt and together form an assembly to discuss the creation of a new political structure for Egypt. Ali called for the new system to guarantee freedom of the press and to define the powers of the army and police. Ali states that he represents neither the Muslim Brotherhood, nor any faction of the Egyptian armed forces. He said in a late October 2019 interview with Middle East Eye that in response to his videos, he had been contacted by many groups, and that the opposition to el-Sisi had become unified. He stated, \\"leftists, secularists, Muslim Brotherhood, liberals, all of them are now with me.\\" =Egyptian Consensus Document= On 28 December 2019, the day before the Egyptian National Action Group (ENAG) was officially launched with the aim of replacing the Egyptian government, Ali announced the \\"Egyptian Consensus Document\\", which he claimed represented the consensus of a wide range of the Egyptian opposition. According to Ali, the Egyptian Consensus Document includes four governing principles: # a civilian democratic system with the rule of law and the separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers and independence of the media; # equal citizenship rights for women and men and for geographical and historically marginalised groups including those of the Sinai, Nubia and Bedouins; # civil, political, economic, social, and cultural human rights as declared in international instruments; # freedom of association; and four main aims for action: # \\"consensus on a comprehensive national project\\" along the lines of the Egyptian revolution of 2011: \\"Bread, freedom, social justice and human dignity\\"; # replacement of the existing government; # release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience and transitional justice; # review of international agreements signed by the government in relation to transfer of Egyptian territory, natural resources and the waters of the Nile. The document also covers the restructuring of state institutions, constitutional reform, democratic elections. Ali described the document as the result of \\"suggestions and inputs ... from all the entities\\" that he had consulted with, after spending three months trying to unite various opposition forces, including \\"liberals\\" and the Muslim Brotherhood and exiled opposition politicians. Media image Leila Arman, writing in Mada Masr, describes Ali showing charisma in his videos, with a character \\"of the intrepid blue-collar badass. A savvy operator with a nose for business. A total baller who flashes cash and treats himself like a prince. An avaricious charmer.\\" She describes his image in the videos as \\"not the classic poor, honest hero, nor is he the educated, middle-class striver who stands up to oppression\\", but instead an image \\"of [honour] and decency as a form of class solace, consolation, and solidarity\\", where the honour consists of Ali's entitlement to money that he claims is owed to him by Sisi. In his 4 September video, Ali describes his political profile, stating, \\"I'm not a liberal, I'm not Brotherhood, I'm not a secularist. I'm a working-class guy\\". Arman describes Ali's conflict with Sisi as a macho competition, \\"Ali plays the paragon of working-class masculinity against Sisi's more simpering version of manhood.\\" She summarises stating that Ali \\"portrays a realistic dramatic character, and then he asks the audience to play the hero with him, to enter the frame. And they have obliged.\\" References Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:2018‚Äì2020 Arab protests Category:Construction trades workers Category:Egyptian activists Category:Egyptian democracy activists ","title":"Mohamed Ali (Egyptian contractor)"},{"id":"61885031","text":"Jersey City Urby is a 70-floor residential building in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States.

He advertised for crew on 22 November 1777, announcing that he planned to sail in early December.NDAR (1964), Vol. 10, p.567. Greenwich was on her way to New Bedford when on 20 April 1778 she encountered Maidstone. Maidstone fired on Greenwich, which immediately struck at , 35 leagues east of Nantucket. She was armed with eight guns, and had a crew of 39 men under Captain Joseph Gardner. Maidstone took out the crew as prisoners and put a prize crew of a midshipman and eight seamen aboard her; the prize crew sailed her to Rhode Island.NDAR (2014), Vol.12, p.150. Royal Navy armed sloop The Navy purchased Greenwich in October and commissioned her under Lieutenant Thomas Spry. Between 6&7 October Greenwich participated in a raid on Little Egg Harbour. Because she and the armed sloop Granby grounded on Mincock Island, their participation was limited. They were gotten off as the raiding force withdrew. On 16 April 1779, the armed sloop Greenwich, , and two other galleys, Thunder and Hornet, captured the two Georgia navy galleys ‚Äì Lee and Congress ‚Äì near Yamasee Bluff on the Savannah River. Congress was armed with one 18-pounder and one 12-pounder gun in her prow, and two 6-pounder and two 9-pounder guns in her wales. She had 100 men aboard including South Carolinian troops. Congress became , under Lieutenant George Prince. Lee was armed with one 12 and one 9-pounder in her prow, and two 4-pounder and two 1-pounder guns in her wales. She had 130 French men aboard. Lee became , under the command of Mr. Edward Ellis Watmough. Fate Greenwich attempted to enter Stono Inlet, South Carolina, on 21 May. Although she had a pilot on board she grounded. Her crew was unable to free her and the next day her predicament led the Americans to bring up two galleys to fire on her. Her crew then burnt her to prevent the Americans capturing her. The pilot was ordered to be held on Scourge but he escaped before the court martial inquiring into her loss.

Early life Born in San Francisco and raised in Los Angeles, Rosenberg graduated from Hollywood High School in 1930, after skipping three grades. After a period working at Stanley Rose's bookstore, she became a story editor at 20th Century Fox and later led the story department at Paramount Pictures. From the mid-thirties to the late forties, Rosenberg was head of the literary department at the Berg-Allenberg talent agency, and worked with such writers as Christopher Isherwood, Bertold Brecht, and Raymond Chandler. In 1950 she adopted a daughter and spent most of the 1950s as a stay-at-home mother. HUAC testimony Along with her first husband Irving Reis, Rosenberg was a member of the Communist Party for seven years, but eventually came to regard the party as intellectually intolerant and prone to using intimidation tactics to enforce conformity. \\"The minute you disagree, they begin to call you names, and this is a form of intimidation, this is a form of fear.\\" In April 1951 she testified before the House Un- American Activities Committee as a friendly witness, identifying other party members whom she had seen at party meetings. Among the names she put forward were actress Dorothy Tree and her husband Michael Uris, writer Francis Faragoh, agent George Willner, screenwriter Madeleine Ruthven, artist Edward Biberman, and screenwriter Carlton Moss. Rosenberg's decision to supply names to HUAC led to social ostracism and derision from former friends. Nunnally Johnson sent her a telegram stating, \\"I trust this will convince you that politics is no business for a fetching girl. Politics is for flat-chested girls.\\" On another occasion she was derided as a \\"stool pigeon\\" while walking down La Cienaga Boulevard. Her former friend Dalton Trumbo criticized her for having named names selectively: \\"[She] behaved like most informers when called before HUAC: she gave the names of communists she probably did not like, and withheld the names of communists she probably did like\\". Television career She returned to working as a talent agent in 1960, and represented actors including Robert Redford and James Garner. During this period she persuaded networks to buy the television series Julia, Hogan's Heroes, and Ben Casey. In 1963 she created Breaking Point, a spinoff of Ben Casey which starred Paul Richards as a resident psychiatrist at a fictional New York City hospital. After representing James Garner for several years, she became a partner in his production company Cherokee Productions, which produced the TV series Nichols, The Rockford Files, and Bret Maverick. Rosenberg was nominated three times for an Emmy for her work on The Rockford Files, and won once. In addition to producing The Rockford Files, she also directed six episodes. Personal life Rosenberg was married twice: to director Irving Reis, and to talent agent George Rosenberg. She had one child, an adopted daughter named Amy. In her later years, Rosenberg was an enthusiastic amateur photographer whose works were exhibited at the Peter Fetterman Gallery in Santa Monica. In the late 1990s, she began to experience blindness as a result of macular degeneration.

They wrote, directed, and acted in the 2019 short film Ponyboi, which is the first film to feature an openly intersex actor playing an intersex person.  Personal life  Gallo was born in and grew up in New Jersey. When they turned twelve they learned they had been born without testicles, although the doctor did not tell them they were intersex. The doctor told them they would need to start hormone therapy and have surgery to insert prosthetic testicles when they turned sixteen so they would \\"look and feel like a normal man\\". They have since become outspoken about ending unnecessary cosmetic surgeries performed on children with atypical genitals who are not old enough to give informed consent. Gallo learned about the term \\"intersex\\", and that it applied to them, while writing their master's thesis. Gallo is non-binary and queer. They live in Los Angeles, California.  Career  Gallo left New Jersey to study acting at New York University, where they trained in the Experimental Theatre Wing at the Tisch School of the Arts. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, they attended the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts and earned their master's degree. Gallo created the short film Ponyboi as their master's thesis while at USC. The film is about an intersex Latinx runaway in New Jersey who works in the day at a laundromat and at night as a sex worker. On Valentine's Day, Ponyboi meets and falls in love with a man and begins to overcome his traumatic past. While writing the film, Gallo discovered the term \\"intersex\\" and came to realize it described them. Gallo co-directed the film along with their USC classmate Sad√© Clacken Joseph. The film is produced by executive producer Stephen Fry and co-producers Emma Thompson and Seven Graham. The film has been screened at festivals including the BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival. Gallo is the founder and CEO of the Gaptoof Entertainment production company. In 2019, Gallo won the GLAAD Rising Star Grant, which they have said they intend to use to mentor LGBTQIA+ students in Los Angeles public schools. They were also named in Out's \\"Most Exciting Queers to Follow on Instagram in 2019\\" list and Paper's \\"100 People Taking Over 2019\\" list. In 2020, Gallo performed in an episode of the Hulu original teen drama series Love, Victor, which is a spinoff of the 2018 film Love, Simon. Gallo appears in episode 8, \\"Boys' Trip\\", as the character Kim, who is one of Simon's several LGBT roommates.  Activism  Gallo is an intersex rights activist, and has spoken out about issues including unnecessary surgery on intersex children. They have supported California Senate Bill 201, which would ban doctors from performing cosmetic surgeries on children with atypical genitals until they are old enough to give informed consent.

In a blog post on her official website, Palmer explained the backstory of how she was obsessed with the Pink Dots as a teenager, and even wrote and directed an experimental dialogue-free play inspired by their album Asylum when she was seventeen. When she was nineteen, the band needed a place to stay while on tour in Boston, Massachusetts and Palmer offered up her house. The Legendary Pink Dots also served as an opening act for Palmer's band the Dresden Dolls in the early 2000s. The two of them spent years trying to find a time to record an album together, but due to struggles in Palmer's personal life, plans always fell through. Most of the album was recorded in the house of English musician Imogen Heap. On May 19, 2017, Ka-Spel released a four-track studio album called High on Station Yellow Moon that features Palmer on three of the tracks. Critical reception The album received a score of 60/100 based on reviews from nine critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\", making it Palmer's lowest rated album on the site. AllMusic summarized the album with \\"At best, I Can Spin a Rainbow feels like the work of two talented artists savoring a long weekend of boundless creativity together, but from an outsider's perspective, the results are a bit too impenetrable to contextualize without having been in the room to witness its genesis.\\" Marc Hirsh's review for the Boston Globe echoed the inaccessibility of the album, saying \\"Every album she's ever had a hand in is, in one way or another, about creating a community. I Can Spin a Rainbow may be the first that goes about it by shutting people out instead of bringing them in.\\" The A.V. Club called the album \\"tuneless\\" and \\"just about as 'for the fans' as it gets.\\" Andrew Dorsett of PopMatters deemed the album \\"insufferable\\" and that it \\"sounds like an inside joke, an indulgence on a whim that few others share or can access.\\" In contrast, Nina Keen of Drowned in Sound praised the album, saying \\"Each song tells its own story so intensely and so completely, like 11 musical horror novellas, that listening to any of them individually produces an experience more like that of listening to a shortish, intense, masterpiece- like album, especially as the songs often have a few different musical sections and ideas.\\" Track listing All songs written by Palmer and Ka-Spel Personnel *Recorded at Hideaway Studio and Chez Dots, London in Summer 2016. *Mastered by Ray Steeg and Peter Van Vliet *Vocals and instruments: Amanda Palmer and Edward Ka-Spel *Violins: Patrick Q.

It was a centre for the study of ancient Greek literature and the Greek Fathers, and through its Syriac translations it transmitted Greek works to the Islamic world. It was \\"the most important intellectual centre of the Syriac Orthodox ... from the 6th to the early 9th century\\", when it was sacked and went into decline. Location Qenneshre was in the region of Upper Mesopotamia. According to YƒÅq≈´t, it was four parasangs from Mabbug and seven from Serugh. In the 1990s, Spanish archaeologists discovered a large monastic site on the western bank of the Euphrates River near its confluence with the Sajur. They identified it as Qenneshre. In 2005‚Äì2006, however, the Syrian archaeologist Yousef al-Dabte excavated a monastic site on the eastern bank of the Euphrates across from JirbƒÅs (ancient Europos), identifying it with Qenneshre. The latter identification is more likely. History The monastery was founded around 530 by John bar Aphtonia, abbot of the monastery of Saint Thomas near Seleucia Pieria, who led some monks away to found a new house in the face of the anti-miaphysite policy of Emperor Justin I. John's second house may have been originally dedicated to Saint Thomas as well. It is not clear if it is the \\"monastery of Beth Aphtonia\\" referred to in some Syriac sources. The new monastery's emphasis on Greek studies was inherited from Seleucia Pieria. In its heyday, which lasted until the 9th century, Qenneshre had about 370 resident monks. In 623, according to the Chronicle of 724, the Slavs raided the island of Crete and captured some monks of Qenneshre, killing twenty of them in the process. These were probably exiles who had fled the Persian invasion of Mesopotamia in 602. Sometime after 809, probably around 811, Qenneshre was sacked and burned by renegade Arabs, probably under the leadership of Na·π£r ibn Shabath al- øUqaylƒ´. Around 820, Patriarch Dionysios of Tel Ma·∏•re, a former monk of Qenneshre, received permission to rebuild the monastery from  øUthmƒÅn, son of ThumƒÅma ibn al-Walƒ´d, who had succeeded his father as the effectively autonomous local leader in the midst of the civil war that followed the death of the Caliph HƒÅr≈´n al-Rashƒ´d in 809. Qenneshre never regained its previous stature. Qenneshre was still prominent enough to be visited by bishops in the 10th century. In the reign of Emir Sayf al-Dawla (died 967), it was a major destination for tourists from Mabbug, according to Ibn al- øAdƒ´m, writing in the 13th century. When the monastery was abandoned is not entirely clear, but archaeological evidence suggests it was still inhabited in the early 13th century. Centre of Greek learning The bilingual culture of the monastery has labelled Graeco-Syriac or Syro- Hellenic. Other monasteries of the West Syriac tradition with the same bilingual culture include Mar Mattai, Mar Zakay, Mar Saba, Saint Catherine's and the Black Mountain. Both secular and religious works were translated from Greek into Syriac by the monks of Qenneshre and those they trained. Tumo of ·∏§arqel, Patriarch Athanasios II and Ya øqub of Edessa are all known to have studied Greek at Qenneshre, as probably did Severos Sebokht and George, bishop of the Arabs, and possibly Phocas of Edessa. The translator Pawla of Edessa worked \\"according to the tradition of Qenneshre\\", as a note in a manuscript of his translations of Severus of Antioch relates. There is as of yet no scholarly study of the manner and techniques of the Qenneshre school of translation. The translation and re-translation of biblical, patristic and secular philosophical texts suggests a distinct \\"miaphysite curriculum of study\\" crafted and promoted at Qenneshre. Among the works translated at Qenneshre or by monks from Qenneshre are the Homilies of Gregory of Nazianzus by Paul of Edessa in 623‚Äì624; the hymns of Severus of Antioch also by Paul and later revised by Ya øqub of Edessa; Basil of Caesarea's Hexaemeron by Athanasios; Aristotle's Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, Topics and Sophistical Refutations by Athanasios II; Aristotle's Categories by Ya øqub in the early 8th century; and Aristotle's On Interpretation by George, bishop of the Arabs, who also re-translated the Prior Analytics, in both cases adding his own introduction and commentary. The entire Organon (Aristotle's collected works on logic) was available in Syriac by the death of Athanasios II in 684. The monks of Qenneshre, as well as those of Qartmin, maintained kept a record of important events in the form of regularly updated annals. These annals served as a source for the 6th-century Chronicle of Edessa and the 7th-century Chronicle of 724. According to Dionysios of Tel Ma·∏•re, Ya øqub of Edessa and John the Stylite \\"charted the succession of years\\" in the manner of Eusebius of Caesarea. Qenneshre supplied several bishops and seven patriarchs of Antioch. Besides the aforementioned Dionysios and Athanasios II, Patriarchs Julian I, Athanasios I, Theodore, Julian II, George I were monks from Qenneshre. The 13th-century historian Bar Hebraeus specifically notes that these patriarchs learned Greek at Qenneshre. For part of the 7th century, according to the biography of Theodota of Amida (died 698), the patriarchs of Antioch even resided at Qenneshre. Severos Sebokht is called a \\"bishop of Qenneshrin\\" by Bar Hebraeus, which may indicate that he was the bishop of Chalcis or perhaps even that Qenneshre had a bishop for a short time.

Creation  The institution of the artistic events that take place in Eleusis was established in 1975 and owes its name to the ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus, who originated from the city. The responsibility of the organizing lies with the municipality of Eleusis and a large number of volunteers.  Art events  This annual artistic event takes place at the end of Summer and at the beginning of Autumn (usually beginning at the end of August and lasting until early September). The main program contains a large number of events from various areas such as theatre plays, music concerts, dances, visual art exhibitions and installations, cinema projections and others. With the passage of time the program is being enriched and now it constitutes a very important cultural event, not only for the town of Eleusis but for the wider region of Attica.  Location  The vast majority of the events take place at an abandoned industrial factory (formerly a soap factory that had been built in 1875) near the beach of Eleusis, with the exclusion of the first concert that takes place at the archeological site of the town, the location emphasizes the relation of the town with the modern industrial activity of Greece. The theatre plays are performed at a prefabricated metal and wooden theatre while the surrounding buildings are used for art installations and other artistic activities of the festival.  Other activities  Despite of the main program of the Aeschylia festival, each year a plethora of other events take place that are connected with it. For example, the most notable event is the Semi-marathon ‚ÄúOn the Traces of Iera Odos‚Äù of 21 km (Athens- Eleusis) which also is held annually.

It was written by Susan Soon He Stanton and directed by Matt Shakman. \\"Argestes\\" shows Roy family members and senior Waystar Royco executives at a media- focused retreat, Argestes. At the retreat, Logan's plans to purchase PGM fall through after criminal activity by members of Waystar Royco's Brightstar cruise line comes to light. The episode introduces Fisher Stevens as Hugo Baker, a Senior Vice President for communications in the parks and cruises division of Waystar Royco. Plot The Roys (with the exception of Shiv) attend Argestes, an international media-focused business retreat, hoping to finalize their acquisition agreement with the Pierces. The conference attracts a large, varied crowd that includes some of the Roys' enemies, such as Lawrence, Stewy and Sandy. Shiv, meanwhile, is shadowing Frank in New York, and receives word that a news story about Waystar's cruise line scandal is about to be published. Logan, Kendall, and Gerri are also informed about the imminent release of the article by Hugo Baker, a senior VP of communications at Waystar's parks and cruises division. They get on a call with Shiv and decide how to contain the story's release, and agree that they will need a \\"white knight\\" to represent the company at the event should the scandal go public. Logan asks Shiv to fly to the conference. Meanwhile, Tom and Greg struggle to find an appropriate slogan for Tom's upcoming presentation on ATN after Greg discovers that the company violated viewers' privacy rights. Roman and Gerri find ways to keep Waystar financially afloat amidst the triple burden of the scandal, the takeover bid and the PGM acquisition; Roman attempts to enlist the aid of Azerbaijani billionaire Eduard Asgarov, who agrees to provide money to Waystar if the company runs propaganda on behalf of his home country. That night, Shiv arrives at Argestes, and Tom confides in her his fear of becoming the public scapegoat for the cruises scandal, given that he was placed in charge of the documents and attempted to destroy the evidence. Nan and Rhea arrive at the conference the following morning and have breakfast with Logan and Kendall, who attempt to rush through the final steps in securing their deal. In the middle of the meeting, however, New York Magazine publishes their expos√© of the scandal, and Logan and Kendall excuse themselves to assess the situation alongside Shiv, Roman, Gerri and Hugo. They learn the details of Lester McClintock's sexual misconduct aboard the company's cruises, and after some disagreement, decide that Kendall and Roman should represent the company at an upcoming panel discussion at the conference that night. Rhea meets with Shiv and admits that she wants the acquisition to succeed out of her own self-interest. She also convinces Shiv to go onstage with her brothers at the event. During the panel discussion, the siblings offer conflicting responses to most of the interview questions, and the family becomes indignant when Shiv makes a joke referring to Logan as a \\"dinosaur\\" and seemingly suggests that it is time for him to step down from the company. In the argument that ensues following the event, Logan violently strikes Roman in the face, angering Kendall. The conference ends with a roast event hosted by stand-up comedian Zell Simmons, who makes a number of cutting jokes at the Roys regarding the cruises scandal. Nan, who has begun to reconsider her relationship with the Roys, walks out of the event, and Logan and Rhea chase after her. Nan fires Rhea for conspiring with the Roys and calls off the acquisition deal. An infuriated Logan is unable to do anything as Nan is driven away from Argestes. Production The episode was filmed at the Whiteface Lodge, near Lake Placid, in upstate New York.

Annette Carson was the Claimant, the Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions (the UK Government) being the Defendant and the Commonwealth of Australia was an intervening party. This a Human Rights Act 1998 case on the \\"Right to property\\" under Article 1 of the First Protocol and Prohibition of Discrimination under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights as reflected in UK law.  Background  In April 2002, Carson brought this case before the High Court under the Human Rights Act 1998. Carson had spent most of her working life in the UK, and during that time she kept paying her full National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and UK taxes where applicable. She relocated to South Africa in 1989 for work purposes, and continued paying NICs to ensure that on retirement she would be eligible for the full UK State Pension. This she had started drawing in September 2000. She then realised that the amount she received would not be increased in line with her peers in the UK, and her pension was being \\"frozen\\" at the level at which she first started receiving it. Carson contended that she was being discriminated against with regard to deprivation of the annual inflationary increase to her UK State Pension because she had relocated to South Africa for work purposes para 9. She had determined that UK pensioners living in some overseas countries received the annual increase, whilst others, like her, were deprived of this annual increase. Carson also contended that the failure of the UK Government to pay to pensioners resident in certain countries abroad the inflation uprating of their UK State pensions, while paying the annual uprating in other countries, contravened the Human Rights Act 1998 (based on the European Convention on Human Rights) on grounds of discrimination. Annual uprating to the UK State Pension is payable in countries like the UK, the (EEA) and a number of disparate countries (the United States, for example), whilst not being payable in predominantly Commonwealth countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. In addition, Carson contended that this contravened Article 14 of the Convention (Prohibition of Discrimination), and also that her state pension, or alternatively its uprating, were \\"pecuniary rights\\", and therefore ‚Äúpossessions‚Äù within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol of the Convention (Protection of Property).  UK state pension recipients  In May 2002, there were 11.1 million pensioners in receipt of a UK state pension - 10.2 million living in the UK and 900,000 who resided abroad. Of those, 418,000 resided in countries where UK pensioners received the annual inflationary increase to their UK state pension, and 482,000 who, like Carson, resided in countries which did not receive the annual increase. Source: Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) - Stat-Xplore database - May 2002 Of the 482,000 pensioners who did not receive the annual increase to their UK State Pension, 465,000 of them resided in just 10 countries - the remaining 17,000 were spread far and wide around the world. The top 10 \\"Frozen\\" countries at that time were: Source: Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) - Stat-Xplore database - May 2002  Judgment  Justice Burnton stated that: :\\"Very many of the expatriate UK pensioners who do not receive uprated pensions have a strong and understandable sense of grievance......They feel that they have been deprived of an increasingly substantial part of the fruit of their contributions......as a result, they have formed associations to press their cause for equal treatment\\" para 6; Carson claimed that she had not been informed that her UK state pension would be \\"frozen\\" when she decided to pay her voluntary contributions from South Africa. para 7 and that the failure of the UK Government to pay her the amount of the annual uprating wrongfully deprived her part of her pension and the entirety of the uprating. para 9 The UK Government also claimed that their policy decision not to pay uprating to Carson and others in her position was justified. para 10 The Court believed that there were seven key issues that needed addressing: para 15 # Is the state pension or the uprating a possession of Carson within the meaning of Article 1 of the First Protocol? # If so, is the failure or refusal of the Government to pay an uprated pension to Carson a deprivation of that possession for the purposes of Article 1 of the First Protocol? # If so, is that deprivation justified? # If uprating is not a possession for the purposes of Article 1 of the First Protocol, is the payment of uprating to some, but not all, pensioners nonetheless within the scope of Article 14? i.e. does Carson's complaint relate to ‚Äúthe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in (the) Convention?‚Äù # If so, what is the criterion applied to determine the differential treatment of pensioners? # Is that criterion a ground ‚Äúsuch as sex, race, ‚Ä¶ or other status‚Äù that is, unless objectively justified, prohibited by Article 14? # If so, is the differential treatment of Carson's wrongful discrimination in breach of Article 14 as compared with: ::(i) pensioners living in the UK, or ::(ii) pensioners residing in countries such as the United States where the UK State Pension is uprated? According to the Third Report (January 1997) of Social Security Committee Report: :‚ÄúIt is impossible to discern any pattern behind the selection of countries with whom bilateral agreements have been made providing for uprating.‚Äù. para 30 The Report went on to say: :\\"Surely no one would have deliberately designed a policy of paying pensions to people living abroad intending to end up where we are today....it would be clearly impractical to negotiate bilateral agreements with each of the other countries where people draw British state retirement pensions, and in any case unnecessary; a simple change in British law could enable upratings to be paid in any or all overseas countries provided the political will was there to do so. On 13 November 2000, Mr. Jeff Rooker, Minister of State said in the House of Commons: :‚ÄúI have already said I am not prepared to defend the logic of the present situation. It is illogical. There is no consistent pattern. It does not matter whether it is in the Commonwealth or outside it. We have arrangements with some Commonwealth countries and not with others. Indeed, there are differences among Caribbean countries. This is an historical issue and the situation has existed for years\\". para 32 The UK Government stated that successive governments have limited the annual increase to the UK state pension since the increase is based on economic factors in the UK. At the same time, to pass on the increase to pensioners who have chosen to live in \\"frozen\\" countries would mean that to do so would create an additional tax burden of UK taxpayers. para 34 The United Kingdom is the only OECD country that discriminates between pensioners living in different overseas countries. para 36 In Corner (App. No. 11271/84), the (European) Commission rejected as manifestly ill-founded the complaint that the failure to pay uprating infringed Article 1 of the First Protocol and Article 14. In Justice Burnton's opinion, this case in and of itself was enough to rule in the Government's favour. para 43 Justice Burnton also stated: :\\"...a government may lawfully decide to restrict the payment of benefits of any kind to those who are within its territorial jurisdiction, leaving the care and support of those who live elsewhere to the governments of the countries in which they live. Such a restriction may be based wholly or partly on considerations of cost, but having regard to the wide margin of discretion that must be accorded to the government, I do not think it one that a court may say is unreasonable or lacking in objective justification\\". para 73 Justice Burnton concluded that the remedy to the \\"frozen\\" UK state pension annual increase issue was a political decision and not a judicial one, and, as a result, he dismissed the application, and found in favour of the UK Government. Costs were awarded against Carson, be she was given leave to appeal. paras 76 & 77 On 22 June 2002, the \\"frozen\\" pensions issue was raised in the House of Lords, and there was reference to the Carson case. This case evoked emotions around the world, with some writing to the UK Parliament in protest. Cited as: [2002] EWHC 978 (Admin), [2002] 3 All ER 994.

Two of his novels, The Arid Sky and Among the Lost, have been translated into English. Biography and books Born in Mexico City on 6 January 1978, Emiliano Monge studied political science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and taught there as a professor. He moved to Barcelona and embarked on a career as a writer. His short story collection Arrastrar esa sombra was a finalist for the 2008 Prix Antonin-Artaud, and his novel Morirse de memoria was a finalist for the same award in 2010, winning Monge the for novels. His works have also been published in La Jornada, Letras Libres and the Hoja por Hoja book review of Reforma. =El cielo √°rido= Mexican novelist √Ålvaro Enrigue commented on Monge's El cielo √°rido (2012), and placed him in the group of \\"Mexico's new writers\\" (Enrigue sees a watershed in Felipe Calder√≥n start in 2006 of the Mexican Drug War) who are less inclined to employ allegory, and who > are much more open in the way they represent the world they inherited... > Monge published an extraordinary novel last year, El cielo √°rido (The barren > sky), in which the chaos that violence brings to people's lives is rendered > by a desperate narrative device: as the plot moves forward, the narrator > changes the names of the characters because nothing is what it seems. El cielo √°rido was translated into English by Thomas Bunstead and published by Restless Books; the main character is \\"a ruthless outlaw turned even more ruthless head of a small state ministry\\". It received positive reviews in the English press, with one critic praising his prose as \\"crisp\\" and commenting on \\"his nonlinear narration [which] creates a heightened sense of unpredictability\\". Mark Athitakis, writing for the Los Angeles Times, called it a \\"stellar English-language debut\\". The book was translated in other languages, including Dutch. Geurt Frantzen, for Literair Nederland, commented on the \\"exuberance\\" that he says characterizes much Latin-American writing, but noted that Monge's style is quite distinct and has a 19th-century flavor to it. The narrator/author is very much present and, according to Frantzen, seems anxious to actually break into the story, announcing upcoming events; Frantzen also comments on the main character's development, from a ruthless killer to someone who almost chooses a less violent family life. Maarten Steenmeijer, in de Volkskrant, writes that Monge seems to proudly lean on the Latin-American tradition (in \\"themes, settings, and style\\") that Roberto Bola√±o and others rejected, but without falling back into magical realism. Steenmeijer sees comparisons with two Mexican classics, Juan Rulfo's Pedro P√°ramo and Carlos Fuentes's The Death of Artemio Cruz, but that Monge's debut is \\"magisterial\\": \\"Praise to the author, praise to the translators. The Arid Sky is a great Latin-American novel, even in Dutch\\". =Among the Lost= Monge's 2018 novel Among the Lost is a love story between two human traffickers set in the jungles and wastelands of the Mexican‚ÄìUS border area. The Guardian said \\"Monge balances the dour, apocalyptic brutality of Cormac McCarthy with lively, grim humour ‚Äì evident in the exasperated exchanges ‚Äì all of which makes the stark truths driving this flamboyant narrative a little easier to swallow\\". When asked in an interview with TLS about writing as a political act, he answered, \\"They are inseparable. It has nothing to do with the themes or the characters, but the language. It is inalienable. When sitting before the blank page, the only certainty that must be had is to write in a language different from the language of power. This for me is also fundamental\\". The novel was awarded the Elena Poniatowska Iberoamerican Novel Prize in 2016 by the Mexico City government. =No contar todo= In 2018, Monge released No contar todo (Not Telling Everything), his first nonfiction title. The book tells three autobiographical tales, interwoven to explore the generational acculturation towards \\"male violence\\". One focuses on his grandfather, Carlos Monge Mckey, who faked his own death after blowing up a quarry owned by his brother-in-law. Another relates his family's rules for protection when home alone, as a response to the violent era of Monge's childhood. The final story is about his father, Carlos Monge S√°nchez, who fought as a guerrilla soldier alongside Genaro V√°zquez Rojas. El Pa√≠s described the book as \\"a journey through the torments of a country‚Äîalready overdiagnosed in multiple essays‚Äîbut that cries out for the humanization of its daily realities\\". El Cultural hailed Monge's \\"realistic creation of three distinct voices, an achievement that is ever more rare in contemporary narrative\\".

The novel is a love story between two human traffickers set in the jungles and wastelands of the Mexican‚ÄìUS border area. Eileen Battersby, writing for The Guardian, said \\"Monge balances the dour, apocalyptic brutality of Cormac McCarthy with lively, grim humour ‚Äì evident in the exasperated exchanges ‚Äì all of which makes the stark truths driving this flamboyant narrative a little easier to swallow\\". The novel was translated into English by Frank Wynne and published by Scribe. Plot and characters The two main characters, Estela and Epitafio (\\"about the weirdest variation of Romeo and Juliet yet to emerge anywhere\\"), are former orphans who engage in human trafficking, gathering (and brutalizing) people who have fled their countries to sell them. Epitafio is forcibly married to another woman on orders of Father Nicho, the priest who runs the orphanage where they were dumped; Estela and he carry on a love affair mostly per cell phone as they ferry their loads of human cargo through an unnamed border area, with the orphanage as one of the central points. Father Nicho, who runs part of their operation, is planning to get rid of Epitafio and install a younger prot√©g√©, Sepelio, in his place. Other characters are a 14- and a 16-year-old boy, \\"sons of the jungle\\", who guide groups of refugees through the jungle and steal their possessions. One of the refugees, a \\"giant\\" former boxer whom Epitafio names Mausoleo, is saved from the group to become complicit in the operation, enforcing Epitafio's violent rule and killing two men early in the novel ‚Äì he crushes a young refugee boy to death because he wouldn't obey Epitafio's command for him to keep quiet. His \\"inner struggle\\" is, according to one critic, the novel's \\"one true moral conflict\\". The novel's structure, according to Daniel Hahn, engages the readers and compromises them: \\"Estela and Epitafio are our main anchors, their experiences and relationship driving the story's developments, but these magnetic central characters are people-traffickers and kidnappers, capable of startling violence and dehumanising cruelty\\" ‚Äì as readers become invested in them, they thus align themselves with the two. Style Emiliano Monge discussing his book, \\"Las Tierras arrasadas\\" (translated as \\"Among the Lost\\") in 2016 Monge's prose is larded with quotes (in italics) from Dante's Inferno and from the testimony of migrants from Central America on their way to the United States. He uses a \\"combination of slang and high literary diction\\". Lily Meyer, who reviewed the book for NPR, commented on the stylistic choices and their structural importance: > Monge borrows Dante's language to describe Estela and Epitafio's nameless > victims, and uses the real-life testimonies to give his fictional migrants a > voice. They interrupt the traffickers throughout the novel, functioning as a > Greek chorus. Alongside Monge's elevated language and his habit of giving > characters Homeric epithets as well as names, the testimonies transform > Among the Lost into a 21st-century epic of sorts. Hahn says those quotes are \\"destabilising\\" and mark the existence of \\"the timeless, nameless, undifferentiated creatures in the trucks\\", and praises the novel for \\"the acrobatic leaps in register, between richly poetic and spat-out visceral expletive, somehow remaining all of a piece\\". In addition, Hahn remarks on the narrative technique, which can move from one place and plot line to another with great speed: \\"The jumps between strands of the story often happen mid-sentence, a neat trick that just adds to the pull this book exerts on its readers\\". Characters are shown to come from a set of meaningful and often traumatic experiences, even if Monge does not always fully explain: > Emiliano Monge is perfectly happy to expose his readers to the unexplained, > with stretches of dialogue whose meaning is clear to the characters but not, > initially, to us. Everybody has a haunting past we don't know about, which > seeps in gradually through their memories. Lily Meyer came to a different appreciation of these differences in register. She finds it successful \\"on a linguistic level\\", and that the \\"collaging works flawlessly\\": Monge \\"is expert at shifting from high language to low\\". But reserving \\"beautiful prose for the disenfranchised\\" also entails a risk ‚Äì the \\"gamble\\" pays off, she says, but \\"it might have distracted him from his moral questions a bit too much... Why should we care about Estela and Epitafio's love story? Like most of Monge's characters, the answer gets lost\\". Critical response Reviewers were positive. Daniel Hahn called it a \\"fine novel\\" and praised its style and narrative technique, calling Monge \\"one of the most talented and interesting young novelists writing from today's Mexico\\". Lily Meyer praised the language and structure: the writing is \\"beautiful, fast- paced, and completely his [Monge's] own\\". Eileen Battersby, who wrote the \\"atmospheric novel is alive with Shakespearean echoes and grim humour\\", praised plot and language, and concluded \\"Monge balances the dour, apocalyptic brutality of Cormac McCarthy with lively, grim humour ‚Äì evident in the exasperated exchanges ‚Äì all of which makes the stark truths driving this flamboyant narrative a little easier to swallow\\". She also praised the translation, saying \\"the ferocious eloquence of his [Monge's] prose... has been magnificently well served by translator Frank Wynne's Miltonic register\\".

Biography Possibly the son of twice-praetor Caius Plautius Rufus,Prosopographia Imperii Romani. p.516 Publius Plautius Rufus is mentioned in connection with two conspiracies in the ancient histories. In the year AD 6, Cassius Dio writes that, due to the discontent of the people due to fire, famine and the new military tax, a pamphletting campaign was launched in the city. This was traceable to 'Publius Rufus,' though it was soon found that others were using his name falsely and seditiously, and Plautius was found to be not guilty of the crime.Dio, Roman History, Book 55, ch 27.Peter Michael Swan, The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History, p. 184. Then, in the year AD 8, Suetonius writes of a further, non- specific conspiracy which was said to involve 'Plautius Rufus' and Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1), husband of Augustus' granddaughter, Julia the Younger. Plautius Rufus' name is thus restored by combining these two mentions.Oxford commentary to Suetonius' Life of the Divus Augustus, 2014, p164.Peter Michael Swan,The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History, p. 184. However, there is no scholarly agreement that these two incidents, nor these two names, are related. Alternative theories have been posited: it is possible that his name should be rendered Plotius Rufus, the triumvir monetalis in BC 16-15 Prosopographia Imperii Romani, p.516 or that these two incidents may refer to two different men.Oxford commentary to Suetonius' Life of the Divus Augustus, 2014, p164.Peter Michael Swan,The Augustan Succession: An Historical Commentary on Cassius Dio's Roman History, p. 184. The modern historian Birch speculates that Plautius Rufus may have been closely linked with Agrippa Postumus and may have been the man who was deprived of a consulship in AD 5 due to his links with Julia the Younger.R.A Birch, Classical Quarterly, Vol31, 1981.

That was the first appearance on his ARCY Live! tour of the United States and Canada that year. On that tour, he created a large-scale mural of Elvis Presley during Elvis Fest in Tupelo, Mississippi and painted 15 live murals at the Pacific National Exhibition in Vancouver, Canada. In April 2019, his graffiti art featuring notable sports figures and moments on the walls of Dan Patrick's \\"man cave\\" studio was unveiled on The Dan Patrick Show. In August of that year, Christenson made an appearance at the Nebraska State Fair.

The Astros defeated the Yankees in six games, advancing to face the 2019 National League champions, the Washington Nationals, who they lost to in seven games. The series was played in a 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 format, with the first two and last two (if necessary) games played at the home ballpark of the team with the better regular season record, the Astros. The series was the 50th in league history, with Fox/Fox Sports 1 televising all games in the United States. For the third straight year, Major League Baseball sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series; as with the NLCS, this ALCS was sponsored by GEICO and officially known as the 2019 American League Championship Series presented by GEICO.ESPN‚Äôs Cross- Platform Coverage of the 2019 MLB Postseason ‚Äì ESPN Press Room U.S.. espnpressroom.com. Retrieved on October 10, 2019. Background The best-of- five American League Division Series were scheduled for October 4‚Äì10. The top- seeded Houston Astros won their first two games against the Tampa Bay Rays, winner of the American League Wild Card Game. The Rays won the next two games to force a deciding Game 5, which Houston won to advance to their third straight ALCS; each game of the series was won by the home team. Houston was 1‚Äì1 in prior ALCS appearances. When they competed in the National League, Houston was 1‚Äì3 in NLCS appearances. The second-seeded New York Yankees swept their series against the third-seeded Minnesota Twins to clinch their 17th ALCS appearance. New York was 11‚Äì5 in prior ALCS appearances. This series was a sequel to the 2017 ALCS, which the Astros won in seven games, and the third overall postseason meeting between the two teams. The Astros and Yankees faced each other seven times during the 2019 regular season, with the Astros winning four of those games. Summary Game summaries =Game 1= Gleyber Torres was 3-for-5 with 5 RBIs in Game 1. Game 1 starting pitchers were Masahiro Tanaka for the Yankees and Zack Greinke for the Astros. The Yankees scored first with Gleyber Torres driving in DJ LeMahieu in the top of the fourth inning. They added two runs in the top of the sixth, on home runs by Torres and Giancarlo Stanton, and added two more runs in the top of the seventh, via four consecutive two-out singles, with Torres collecting two more RBIs. In the top of the ninth, the Yankees extended their lead to 7‚Äì0, via a leadoff homer by Gio Urshela and another RBI by Torres, this one coming on a fielder's choice, as LeMahieu scored from third on a groundout. Jonathan Lo√°isiga concluded matters, pitching the bottom of the ninth, with the game ending on a Michael Brantley fly out to Cameron Maybin as the Yankees took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Tanaka earned the win, allowing just one hit while striking out four and facing the minimum in his six innings (18 batters). Greinke was charged with the loss, allowing three runs on seven hits in six innings while striking out six. =Game 2= Carlos Correa hit a walk-off home run in Game 2, tying the series at one game all. Game 2 starting pitchers were James Paxton for New York and Justin Verlander for Houston. Houston scored first, as Carlos Correa doubled in Alex Bregman who had singled to lead off the bottom of the second inning. Yankees manager Aaron Boone removed Paxton after 2‚Öì innings‚ÄîPaxton had allowed one run on four hits while striking out three. The Yankees took a 2‚Äì1 lead in the fourth, with Aaron Judge homering after DJ LeMahieu had walked. Houston tied the game in the fifth, on a home run by George Springer. Verlander departed after 6‚Öî innings, having allowed two runs on five hits while striking out seven. With no further scoring through regulation, the game went to extra innings. After a scoreless tenth inning, Correa led off the 11th with a home run off J. A. Happ to give the Astros a 3‚Äì2 win and tie the series at 1, going into Yankee Stadium for the next three games. =Game 3= Gerrit Cole pitched seven shutout innings in Game 3. Game 3 starting pitchers were Gerrit Cole for the Astros and Luis Severino for the Yankees. The Astros scored first on a home run by Jos√© Altuve in the first inning. Josh Reddick followed with another homer in the second. The game was delayed by 20 minutes before the top of the fifth inning, as home plate umpire Jeff Nelson had to leave the game, due to the effects of being hit by a foul ball during the top of the fourth inning; Kerwin Danley, who had been the second base umpire, took over behind the plate. Severino left the game in the fifth inning after allowing two runs on five hits, walking three and striking out six in 4‚Öì innings. Houston added two runs in the seventh on a wild pitch by Yankee relief pitcher Zack Britton that allowed Altuve to score, and a sacrifice fly by Yuli Gurriel that scored Michael Brantley. Cole pitched seven shutout innings for the Astros, allowing four hits with five walks and seven strikeouts. Gleyber Torres put the Yankees on the board in the eighth inning with a home run off Joe Smith. Houston closer Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth inning for his first save of the postseason. =Game 4= George Springer hit his second home run of the series in Game 4. Game 4 was originally scheduled for October 16, but was postponed and rescheduled to October 17 due to the \\"bomb cyclone\\" that hit the Northeast. Umpire Jeff Nelson was removed from the umpiring crew after tests indicated he suffered a concussion during Game 3; he was replaced by Mike Everitt. The Yankees scored once in the first inning, forcing in a run with two walks after having runners on first and second with two out. The Astros took a 3‚Äì1 lead in the third inning, via a three-run home run by George Springer. Houston starting pitcher Zack Greinke exited after 4‚Öì innings, having allowing one run on three hits and striking out five. New York starter Masahiro Tanaka was removed one batter into the sixth inning; he was replaced by Chad Green, who gave up a three-run home run to Carlos Correa three batters later. Tanaka was charged with four runs on four hits, while striking out one. A two-run home run by Gary S√°nchez in the bottom of the sixth cut the Astros' lead to 6‚Äì3. A double by Alex Bregman followed by two Yankee errors gave the Astros a run in the eighth. With runners on first and third and nobody out, Yankee left-hander CC Sabathia entered the game in relief of Adam Ottavino and threw 20 pitches to five batters, retiring two, before leaving with a shoulder injury to a standing ovation from fans and players on both teams. The Yankees removed Sabathia from their roster the next day, rendering him ineligible to pitch in the World Series and ending his storied 19-year career. Houston extended their lead to 8‚Äì3 in the ninth inning, on an error, wild pitch, and single. The Yankees were unable to score in the bottom of the ninth, as Roberto Osuna concluded matters by retiring Gleyber Torres on a flyout to Springer and the Astros were a victory away from playing Washington in the World Series. =Game 5= A three-run home run by Aaron Hicks provided the Yankees' winning margin in Game 5. Game 5 was originally scheduled for October 17, but was rescheduled to October 18 when Game 4 was postponed. Pitcher CC Sabathia, who had left Game 4 with a shoulder injury, was removed from the Yankees' postseason roster and replaced by Ben Heller. The Astros took an early 1‚Äì0 lead, as George Springer led off the game with an infield single, went to second on a passed ball, advanced to third on a ground out, and then scored on a wild pitch. DJ LeMahieu tied the game with a home run to lead off the bottom of the first, followed four batters later by an Aaron Hicks three-run homer that hit the right-field foul pole to give the Yankees a 4‚Äì1 lead. New York starting pitcher James Paxton left after six innings, having allowed one run on four hits while striking out nine. Houston starter Justin Verlander went seven innings, striking out nine while allowing four runs on five hits, and suffered the loss. With no scoring other than in the first inning, Aroldis Chapman set down the side in order in the top of the ninth, earning his second save this postseason, as he retired Springer on a groundout to Gio Urshela to send the series back to Houston and extend the Yankees' season. This was the first game in MLB postseason history (1,609 games) that both teams scored in the first inning, then were held scoreless the rest of the game. =Game 6= A walk-off home run by Jos√© Altuve in Game 6 sent the Astros to the World Series. In a \\"bullpen game\\", the starting pitchers were Brad Peacock, who had pitched a scoreless eighth inning in Game 5 for Houston, and Chad Green for New York. Yuli Gurriel gave Houston an early lead, with a three-run homer in the bottom of the first inning. Green left after the first inning, having allowed three runs on two hits, while recording one strikeout. The Yankees closed to 3‚Äì1 in the second inning, after Didi Gregorius doubled and Gary S√°nchez hit an RBI single with two out. Peacock left after 1‚Öî innings, having allowed a run on two hits while striking out two batters. A Gio Urshela home run in the top of the fourth inning trimmed Houston's lead to 3‚Äì2. In the bottom of the sixth, Alex Bregman hit into a fielder's choice, scoring the fourth run for the Astros. In the top of the ninth inning, an Urshela single was followed two batters later by a DJ LeMahieu home run that tied the game at 4. After George Springer extended the bottom of the ninth with a two-out walk, Jos√© Altuve hit a walk-off two-run home run off Aroldis Chapman to win the game and send the Astros to their second World Series in three years. Altuve was named series MVP for Houston, while with this loss the 2010s became the first decade since the 1910s not to have the Yankees play in a World Series, as their last appearance (and title) was in 2009, and the second decade that the Yankees did not win at least one World Series (lost to the Dodgers in 1981 in their only appearance in the World Series in the 1980s). =Composite line score= 2019 ALCS (4‚Äì2): Houston Astros defeated New York Yankees.

History During the 1869‚Äì70 Second German North Polar Expedition of Carl Koldewey this body of water was surveyed by Julius Payer, who was impressed by the beauty of the Alpine-type mountain ranges surrounding the fjord and named it after the Tyrol historical region in the Alps. Since the fjord forms a geographic whole with Young Sound, which had previously been named by William Scoresby, Koldewey used the name \\"Tyrolerfjord\\" ‚Äîor \\"Tiroler Fjord\\" in the reports by Julius Payer‚Äî for the whole water body, all the way to its mouth in Gael Hamke Bay. Later, during the 1929‚Äì1930 Expedition to East Greenland, Lauge Koch reinstated the name \\"Young Sund\\" for the outer section of the water body. There are a number of Norwegian and Danish hunting cabins in the shores of the fjord.

Cardinals starting pitcher Miles Mikolas went six innings, allowing one run on seven hits while striking out seven. The Nationals added a run in the seventh, again with two outs, as Kendrick drove in Adam Eaton, who had tripled. Washington starting pitcher An√≠bal S√°nchez did not allow a hit until a two-out single by Jos√© Mart√≠nez in the eighth inning; S√°nchez struck out five, walked one, and hit two batsmen in 7‚Öî innings. Sean Doolittle relieved S√°nchez and recorded the final four outs, giving Washington the 2‚Äì0 win and a 1‚Äì0 lead in the series. S√°nchez had also been the starting pitcher in the most recent prior one-hitter in playoff history, Game 1 of the 2013 ALCS, coming against the Boston Red Sox when he played for the Detroit Tigers. It was Doolittle's first save this postseason. = Game 2 = Washington starter Max Scherzer held the Cardinals to one hit in seven innings while striking out 11 in Game 2. Nationals closer Daniel Hudson returned to the team from paternity leave. Washington took a 1‚Äì0 lead in the top of the third inning on a home run by Michael A. Taylor. Washington starting pitcher Max Scherzer did not allow a hit until Paul Goldschmidt led off the seventh inning with a single; Scherzer allowed only the one hit, struck out 11, and walked two in seven innings. By holding the Cardinals hitless through the first five innings of each of their starts, Scherzer and teammate An√≠bal S√°nchez repeated a feat they accomplished in Games 1 and 2 of the 2013 American League Championship Series, a feat no other pair of pitchers has ever accomplished in the postseason. The Nationals added two runs in the eighth when Adam Eaton hit a double into the right-field corner to drive in Matt Adams and Trea Turner. Paul DeJong scored the Cardinals' first run of the series in the eighth inning ahead of a double by Jos√© Mart√≠nez over Taylor's outstretched glove. Hudson then retired the final two hitters on fly outs, the second a foul popup to first base, to record the save, his third this postseason. = Game 3 = Howie Kendrick had three doubles and drove in three runs in Game 3. Game 3 starting pitchers were Jack Flaherty for the Cardinals and Stephen Strasburg for the Nationals. Washington scored first, in the third inning; with a runner on first and two outs, a single, double, walk, wild pitch, and another double pushed across four runs. Flaherty exited after four innings, having allowed four runs on five hits while striking out six. Washington added two more runs in the fifth inning, again starting with a runner on first and two outs, via back-to-back doubles. A V√≠ctor Robles home run in the sixth inning extended the lead to 7‚Äì0. Each team scored once in the seventh inning, yielding an 8‚Äì1 final score and giving Washington a commanding 3‚Äì0 lead in the series, as Tanner Rainey concluded matters by working the ninth, and retired Tommy Edman on a flyout to Juan Soto to win it. Flaherty took the loss, while Strasburg was credited with the win, having allowed one run on seven hits while striking out 12 in seven innings. = Game 4 = Daniel Hudson earned the save in Game 4, his second of this NLCS. Game 4 starting pitchers were Dakota Hudson for the Cardinals and Patrick Corbin for the Nationals. The Nationals chased Hudson in the first inning by scoring seven runs on a sacrifice fly, double, and three singles. For the night, Hudson pitched of an inning, allowing seven runs (four earned) on five hits, one walk, and a dropped-throw error by second baseman Kolten Wong. Hudson's seven runs allowed tied the postseason record for most runs allowed in a start lasting of an inning or less, a record set by Mike Foltynewicz in Game 5 of the 2019 NLDS, ironically against the Cardinals. The Cardinals scored their first run in the fourth on a home run by Yadier Molina and three more in the fifth on an RBI groundout by Tommy Edman and a two-run double by Jos√© Mart√≠nez. Corbin was credited with the win after allowing four runs on four hits in five innings; he also walked three and struck out 12. Washington closer Daniel Hudson entered the game with two outs in the eighth inning. After hitting Molina with a pitch and walking Paul DeJong, Hudson retired the final four batters he faced, retiring Tommy Edman on a fly out to center field for the final out, to record his fourth save of this postseason. The win sent the Nationals to the World Series for the first time in the franchise's 51-year history dating back to their founding as the Montreal Expos in 1969. Howie Kendrick was voted the MVP of the series. It was also the first appearance in the World Series for a Washington team since . The Nationals were the last National League team to appear in the World Series, leaving the Seattle Mariners as the only team in Major League Baseball to have never made it. The Cardinals' .130 batting average (16-for-123) set an NLCS record for lowest team batting average. = Composite line score = 2019 NLCS (4‚Äì0): Washington Nationals defeated St. Louis Cardinals.

Early life and career Paula Oliveto was born in Buenos Aires on 10 February 1973, where she attended primary and secondary school. She studied law at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating in 1997, and specialized in state financial administration at the Argentine Budget Association. =Pre-political work= She directed the Pluralist Foundation's Lisandro de la Torre Center for Transparency in Public and Private Management from 2004 to 2007, and was an auditor of the city of Buenos Aires from 2007 to 2013. In the latter year, she was elected legislator. =Legislator of the City of Buenos Aires (2013‚Äì2017)= Oliveto was elected to the Buenos Aires City Legislature in September 2013, and took office on 10 December. In July 2017, as the president of the CC-ARI bloc, together with the PRO and blocs, she formed the Interbloc, creating a majority in the legislature. This bloc brought accusations against various politicians and businessmen of Cristina Kirchner's government. Oliveto was vice president of the Security Commission, and a voting member of the following commissions: * Board of Ethics, Agreements, and Control Bodies * Budget, Finance, Financial Administration, and Tax Policy * Economic Development, Mercosur, and Employment Policy * Justice =National deputy= Oliveto became president of CC-ARI on 25 October 2016. On 10 December 2017, she became a member of the Chamber of Deputies representing the city of Buenos Aires. Fishy contributors scandal Paula Oliveto was involved in events which came to light in July 2018, related to private contributions for the 2015 general and the 2017 legislative elections. This became known as the (). The journalistic portal ' obtained access to a document that proved that Horacio Rodr√≠guez Larreta's administration had set up a scheme to take money from the government of Buenos Aires and funnel it to Elisa Carri√≥'s campaign. Through resolution No. 91, the Buenos Aires government had decided to allocate remuneration units ‚Äì that is, an extra salary supplement that is given in exceptional cases ‚Äì to some 22 public employees in different areas. The amounts to be delivered ranged from 10,000 to 120,000 pesos. But just three months later, according to the National Electoral Chamber, all of the recipients made donations to Elisa Carri√≥'s campaign. These all took place on the same day, in the same amount, and in the same form: 25,000 pesos in cash, thus totaling 300,000 pesos ( US dollars). People came forward who denied having made financial contributions: from school counselors and retirees to city councilors. The victims expressed \\"fear of a possible loss of employment if their names are made known to public opinion.\\" They worked for entities including the Federal Public Revenue Agency (AFIP), the security forces, and the City of Buenos Aires. Employees of the government of Buenos Aires, \\"said they were victims of the crime of identity theft,\\" as they appeared as private contributors for the 2015 election campaign, \\"but also for the Cambiemos Buenos Aires alliance in 2017 and the Vamos Juntos political alliance also in 2017, and which led to the candidates Elisa Carri√≥ and Mar√≠a del Carmen Polledo becoming deputies.\\" Employees claimed to know of \\"a mechanism implemented repeatedly over time\\" to introduce illegal money and/or public funds to finance several of Carri√≥'s campaigns. In this mechanism, according to the complaint, the city employees' personal data was falsely introduced, and the officials responsible for the different ministerial areas were listed as contributors. Osvaldo Marasco, former Cambiemos candidate for mayor of Ituzaing√≥ in the 2015 elections, maintained that Oliveto had proven knowledge of the existence of suspicious contributions in Macrist electoral campaigns, but that she avoided denouncing the maneuver before the judiciary. Marasco added \\"I had gone through people from the ARI who were on my list ‚Äì they told Carri√≥ and Paula Olivetto, and they said: 'With this we can do nothing.'\\" He also involved Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal in his statements. According to Marasco, the maneuver originated with \\"the Capital boys\\", who had since become second-tier or third-tier directors and officials, \\"blocs\\" for the gnocchi of the Buenos Aires government, with contracts. \\"The campaign was banked with silver from the Federal Capital and there was Mar√≠a Eugenia Vidal, I was at the lunches. At that time they were (Horacio Rodr√≠guez) Larreta, (Diego) Santilli, Rogelio Frigerio, Dur√°n Barba, (Edgardo) Cenz√≥n, who was fundamental because he handled the money.\\" He received threats after making these statements. Implication in political espionage case The Parlasur deputy denounced Elisa Carri√≥, Oliveto, and Mariana Zuvic to the judiciary for violation of the Intelligence Law, violation of secrecy, aggravated cover-up, slander, and false denunciation. Vald√©s said that in the framework of the , \\"the deputies of the Civic Coalition used transcriptions of illegal eavesdropping in the Ezeiza prison\\", and that \\"they wanted to take responsibility for instigating the complaint against .\\" In that sense, he said he was \\"certain that Marcelo D'Alessio was handed over to Oliveto\\", and recalled that \\"Oliveto herself acknowledged having spoken with the extortionist and spy after having been raided by Judge .\\" Thus, the disputed \\"used illegal material\\" to organize a press campaign \\"to curb and muddy the investigation of Ramos Padilla,\\" so that for Vald√©s \\"they acted as covert agents of D'Alessio and his band.\\" In early April, , a former spy from the Federal Intelligence Agency (AFI) and right-hand man of Marcelo D'Alessio, was a fugitive. After his arrest, he was taken to testify before the judge in the case, where he showed messages and calls to Civic Coalition deputy Paula Oliveto. He said he knew that they met regularly and even that she also had several meetings in the National Congress with Cambiemos deputy Elisa Carri√≥. He said that deputies asked D'Alessio for information, and that the false lawyer provided them with facts obtained from illegal espionage about opposition leaders. As a result of these events, the FpV-PJ bloc of deputies requested that legislators Elisa Carri√≥ and Paula Oliveto be removed from the National Congress, \\"due to moral incapacity arising in the exercise of their functions.\\" The draft resolution was formally presented on 21 March 2019.

She is the Henry J. Vaux Distinguished Professor of Forest Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2006, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. Career After earning her BA from Friends World College, Peluso joined the Man and Biosphere Research Project No. 1 in Indonesia. Upon her return, her main research focus was on Forest Politics and Agrarian Change in Southeast Asia. In 1984, she conducted her PhD dissertation research in Java, Indonesia and later published it in a book titled Rich Forests, Poor People: Resource Control and Resistance in Java. She taught at the University of California, Berkeley from 1990 to 1992 and was a Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow in Natural Resource Studies in the Energy Resource Group. In 1992, Peluso was appointed an assistant professor of resource policy at Yale University. Peluso coined the term 'counter-mapping' in 1995, having examined the implementation of two forest mapping strategies in Kalimantan. One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the international financial institutions that supported them, such as the World Bank. This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them. She returned to the University of California, Berkeley in 1996 as an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management. In 2001, Peluso published Violent Environments through the Cornell University Press with Michael Watts. In 2003, she was the recipient of a Harry Frank Guggenheim Fellowship. Three years later, she was the recipient of a Harry Frank Guggenheim Fellowship in order to examine territoriality, violence, and the production of landscape history in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Pelusa was awarded Berkeley's 2012 Sarlo Graduate Student Mentoring Award for Senior Faculty Award. In 2015, Peluso was a Senior Fulbright Fellow in Indonesia, where she focused on illegal gold mining. She was also a co-investigator with the University of Hawaii-Manoa and the University of Indonesia for a new National Science Foundation grant examining labor migration and its impact on land use in Indonesia. In 2017, Peluso received a National Science Foundation Geography and Spatial Sciences Program grant to study the impacts labor migration has on Indonesian land use policy and labor markets.

Nancy is the sister of Mike Wheeler and the ex-girlfriend of Steve Harrington. Nancy starts investigating the disappearance of Will Byers when her friend Barbara Holland goes missing as well. She teams up with her future boyfriend Jonathan Byers to investigate Will and Barbara's disappearance, which leads to her discovery of the Upside Down. Nancy is also a playable character in the 2016 horror-themed video game Dead by Daylight. Fictional character biography =Season 1= Nancy is Ted and Karen Wheeler's oldest child. She has a younger brother, Mike, and younger sister, Holly. She is introduced as best friends with Barbara Holland, who doesn't agree with Nancy's new relationship with Steve Harrington. She is also shown to have grown somewhat distant from her brother and his friends, and is unaware of Jonathan's secret feelings for her. After Will goes missing, Nancy offers her sentiments to Jonathan, something which distances herself from Steve's other friends, who think Jonathan is a freak and is likely responsible for Will's disappearance. Nancy becomes involved in the investigation after Barbara disappears while Nancy is having sex with Steve. Due to her guilt for abandoning Barbara and her motivation to find out what happened to her friend, Nancy meets up with Jonathan to discuss Will and Barbara's disappearance. In the course of their investigation, Jonathan and Nancy accidentally discover the alternate dimension where the creature that took Barbara - The Demogorgon - resides, known as \\"The Upside-Down\\". Nancy successfully escapes from The Upside-Down thanks to Jonathan's help and the two retreat back to Nancy's house, where they sleep in her bed to comfort each other. This is witnessed by Steve, who takes the encounter out of context and assumes Nancy is cheating on him. In a fit of rage, Steve's friends Tommy H. and Carol graffiti the Hawkins movie theatre slut-shaming Nancy. Nancy confronts Steve, which results in a fight between Jonathan and Steve, leading to Jonathan's arrest. After Hopper gets a call from the station that Jonathan has been arrested, he and Joyce return to Hawkins where they share the information they know about The Demogorgon. Nancy successfully contacts Mike, who has gone into hiding due to having befriended Eleven and becoming a target of the Hawkins lab. Nancy reunites with Mike and his friends at Hawkins Middle School where they build a makeshift sensory deprivation tank for Eleven to be able to use to find Will and Barbara. Eleven discovers that Barbara has been killed by the Demogorgon, leading to Nancy cementing her determination to kill the monster. Nancy and Jonathan return to the Byers house to create a distraction, to allow Joyce and Hopper safe passage through The Upside-Down to retrieve Will, luring the Demogorgon to the house with blood. Steve arrives in hopes of reconciling with Jonathan, but ends up becoming witness to The Demogorgon. Nancy and Jonathan ask Steve to leave and save himself, but he finds his courage due to his love for Nancy and re-enters the house, successfully injuring the Demogorgon before it is lured back to Hawkins Middle School, where it is seemingly killed by Eleven. Nancy reconciles with Steve and resumes their relationship, gifting Jonathan with a new camera for Christmas. Jonathan first hesitates but takes the gift from Nancy though not telling the truth about his feelings for her. =Season 2= One year after the events of season 1, Nancy and Steve have been consistently having dinners with Barb's parents. Barb's parents do not know that Barb is dead, and have hired a private investigator to look into her disappearance, financing the investigation by selling their house. The private investigator, Murray Bauman, is a bit of a conspiracy theorist, and is shown harassing Hopper for information and sharing his theories. Nancy is still overcome with grief over Barbara's death and begins showing potential signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, believing she is seeing Barbara's ghost following her in the school's library. While attending a Halloween party, Nancy gets drunk and begins verbally berating Steve when he tries to cut her off, leading to a falling out between the two. After Steve angrily leaves the party, she is escorted back home by Jonathan. Nancy confides in Jonathan and the two arrange a meeting with Barb's mother in the park. At the park, Nancy and Jonathan are overcome with the suspicion they are being watched, and are intercepted by agents of the Hawkins Lab. They secretly record a conversation with Dr. Owens, who explains that he is trying to amend for Brenner's mistakes, admitting to culpability in Barbara's death. Nancy and Jonathan visit Murray at his residence to see if the evidence is damning enough to lead to the shutdown of Hawkins Lab. Murray suggests that they water down the story to make it more believable to the public. He also figures out that Nancy and Jonathan have sexual tension, suggesting that they share his guest room, leading to them reciprocating their feelings that night. Upon their return to Hawkins, Nancy and Jonathan find the Byers residence empty and littered with Will's drawings. They head to Hawkins Lab where they soon come across Steve, who has in the meanwhile befriended Dustin, Lucas and Max Mayfield. They head to the front gate where they meet Hopper, Joyce, Mike and a heavily sedated Will, who has become possessed by the Mind Flayer. They return to the Byers house and attempt to interrogate Will, who has been signalling in Morse Code for them to close the gate to The Upside Down. Once they deduce Will's message, the Byers house phone rings, alerting The Mind Flayer to their location. The house becomes swarmed with Demodogs before they are incapacitated by Eleven. The group reunites with Eleven and create a plan which involves Hopper and Eleven returning to Hawkins Lab for Eleven to close the gate, with Joyce and Jonathan going to Hopper's cabin to exorcise Will. Steve encourages Nancy to go with Jonathan and promises to look after Mike and the rest of the kids. With their differences put aside, Nancy accompanies Jonathan in exorcising Will, restraining him and exposing him to numerous heaters. Once the Mind Flayer has successfully exited Will's body, the group signals to Hopper to close the gate. Nancy later attends the official funeral for Bob and Barbara after Hawkins Lab is exposed and shut down. Nancy and Jonathan volunteer help at the Hawkins Middle School Snow Ball, where she sees that Dustin is alone and rejected. Nancy offers to dance with Dustin and consoles him. =Season 3= In the summer of 1985, Nancy and Jonathan get internships at The Hawkins Post under the watch of Tom Holloway. Nancy is eager to impress her sexist male co- workers by suggesting story ideas, which usually resulted in demeaning jokes and comments, leaving Nancy humiliated and embarrassed. One night while Nancy is working late, she answers a call to about rats eating Doris Driscoll's fertilizer. Assuming the guise of reporters, Nancy and Jonathan interview Mrs. Driscoll at her house, where they witness a rabid rat she has captured. Nancy's colleagues reject the story calling Driscoll a nut-job, leading to Nancy returning to the house, only to find that Mrs. Driscoll has become infected by the newly resurrected Mind Flayer, eating fertiliser and screaming that she \\"has to go back\\". In the meanwhile, through possessing Billy Hargrove and Tom's daughter Heather, the Mind Flayer possesses Tom and the rest of the Hawkins Post staff, and compels them to fire Nancy and Jonathan to keep them from learning the truth. Still undeterred and despite an argument with Jonathan, Nancy still decides to pursue the story, noticing symptoms in Mrs. Driscoll similar to that of Will's possession, Nancy calls Jonathan and asks to meet up with Will. As they discuss this information, Nancy, Jonathan, Will, Mike, Eleven, Lucas and Max return to the hospital, only for Nancy and Jonathan to find that Mrs. Driscoll is missing and are intercepted by the flayed Tom and his co-worker Bruce. A fight breaks out, with Jonathan killing Tom while Nancy kills Bruce, before the two flayed hosts merge together to form a monster. The monster is wounded by Eleven before retreating to the sewers. The group takes refuge at Hopper's cabin, but the Mind Flayer manages to track them down and wounds Eleven. The group heads to Starcourt Mall to re- group with Dustin, Steve, Steve's co-worker Robin and Lucas' sister Erica. While there, Hopper, Joyce and Murray arrive who reveal that they know how to close the new opening to the Upside-Down built by a Soviet detachment under the Starcourt Mall. The Mind Flayer arrives at the mall and is fended off with fireworks by Nancy, Jonathan, Will, Lucas, Steve and Robin, as Billy attempts to infect Eleven. Eleven reaches through to Billy, who sacrifices himself to The Mind Flayer to save Eleven, resulting in his death. The gate is eventually closed by Joyce, albeit seemingly at the cost of Hopper's life. After Hopper's death, Joyce takes in Eleven and her, Will and Jonathan sell their house and move away. Nancy and Jonathan share a passionate and emotional kiss goodbye as she watches with her brother, Dustin, Lucas and Max as they leave Hawkins. Reception The portrayal of Nancy by Natalia Dyer has received a very positive critical reception. Nancy's transition from an ordinary teenage girl to a brave and determined young woman was a character arc that many fans and critics responded positively to. Nancy's storyline in season 3 was seen by many as The Duffer Brothers' take on workplace sexism and harassment, and how Nancy overcame the humiliation. This storyline was seen as a positive example on how to tackle contemporary social issues in fiction, however the resolution for this storyline was seen by some as being rather anti-climactic. Nancy's relationship with Jonathan Byers has also been seen by fans and critics as a strong point in the series, and their progression into a romantic couple was seen as being well-deserved. Critics and fans have also noticed how well the two work together, and the chemistry between Dyer and Charlie Heaton, who began dating in real life between production of seasons 1 and 2. Nancy has also been seen as The Duffer Brothers's commentary on final girls in horror franchises from the 1980's. In particular, Nancy has been compared mostly to Nancy Thompson from A Nightmare on Elm Street, the namesake for the character. The character, along with Steve Harrington, appears in the survival-horror videogame Dead by Daylight as a survivor as part of a Stranger Things pack, being hunted by the Demogorgon throughout Hawkins Lab.

She is known for posing for a photo while draped in the gold jewelry from the Treasure of Priam. Life Sofia Engastromenou was born in Athens to a wealthy mercantile family. Her uncle, Bishop Theokletos Vimpos, was hired by Heinrich Schliemann to tutor him in Greek and later tasked with finding a \\"black-haired Greek woman in the Homeric spirit\\" to become his wife. Presented with photos of three women, Schliemann selected the seventeen-year-old Sofia. They were married on 24 September 1869, and would go on to have two children, Andromache (1871-1962) and Agamemnon (1878-1954). Sophia was only briefly present during the 1873 excavations of Hisarlik, during which she was assaulted by a foreman. She departed the site after a month due to the unexpected death of her father. Schliemann later falsified the records to exaggerate Sophia's role in the excavations, and the story that the Treasure of Priam had been smuggled away from the site in Sophia's shawl. After her husband's death in 1890 Sophia continued to give lectures on his work and hosted gatherings in her Athenian residence, the Iliou Melathron. She edited Schliemann's autobiography and published it in 1892. Sophia spent the rest of her life as a member of Athenian high society and sponsor of charitable endeavors. In 1902, after witnessing the sufferings of Greek soldiers of the recent war with Turkey, she and a group of society ladies sponsored the construction of a sanatorium for tuberculosis sufferers in Goudi. She served on its board of directors from 1919 until her death in 1932. The institution has since become the Sotiria Thoracic Disease Hospital, the largest pulmonary center in Greece. In literature and film Sophia was a central character in Irving Stone's 1975 historical novel The Greek Treasure. In the 2007 German television film The Hunt for Troy, Sophia Engastromenou was portrayed by the French actress M√©lanie Doutey. She inspired the 2013 novel Sophia: A Woman's Search for Troy by Nancy Joaquim. Writings * Heinrich Schliemann; Sophia Schliemann (ed.): Heinrich Schliemann's Autobiography. Leipzig, 1892.

She continued her work on topology at Charles University as a doctoral student of Eduard ƒåech, earning a candidate's degree (the Czech equivalent of a Ph.D.) in 1961 with the dissertation Non-F- Topologies. Much later, in 1989, she was also given the Dr.Sc. degree, corresponding to a habilitation. Later life and career In 1960, while still a student, Trnkov√° became an assistant professor at Charles University. She was promoted to docent (associate professor), senior researcher, and full professor in 1967, 1986, and 1991, respectively. She retired in 1999, and died on 27 May 2018. Research Despite beginning her career working in general topology, Trnkov√° shifted as early as 1962 to category theory. Her work in this area included studied of formal completions of categories, the embeddings of categories into categories of topological spaces, category-theoretic automata theory, and the isomorphism of product objects in categories.

It operated from 1962 to 1996. History KDNC went on air September 1, 1962. The station broadcast during the day at 1440 kHz and was owned by the Independent Broadcasting Corporation, with transmitter at Havana and 44th in Spokane; it aired a \\"golden music\\" format. After two years in operation, KDNC moved its studios to the Davenport Hotel. KDNC also spawned KDNC-FM 93.7, which signed on September 30, 1965. Alexander P. Hunter of Spokane acquired KDNC-AM-FM in 1967 and sold it two years later to Radford Sorensen, Wayne Wakefield and Edward Kelley for . KDNC became KXXR on April 15, 1974. The AM station was playing country music in 1979, beautiful music in 1980 and the Music of Your Life format in 1981. The station also broadcast some sporting events; after initially agreeing to carry University of Idaho football for the 1983 season, it abruptly dropped the Vandals after one game to carry University of Notre Dame football instead. KXXR changed dial positions from 1440 to 1550 kHz in January 1984 as part of a major facility change that saw the city of license change from Spokane to Opportunity, as well as a daytime power increase to 10,000 watts and the beginning of nighttime service with 2,500 watts from a new tower site. The new tower site had been approved in 1981, even though local residents feared that the construction of a radio facility close to a school would cause issues with construction crews, as had happened with KGA at another school site. Harold Orr, who had been the station's president in 1975, acquired the station in 1983 after being a former creditor. Orr, whose primary business ventures were 115 H&R; Block tax offices in Oregon and Washington and a leasing company, took the money-losing station off the air in October 1985‚Äîafter a six-month stint with pop music‚Äîbut he retained the license. When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) told him he had to keep the station on the air 72 hours a week to keep the license active, he responded by bringing in former general manager Dick Wright to put together a team of young announcers to run the station 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, beginning in September 1987. The new KSVY did not play commercials, clinging instead to a mix of big band music and oldies, all while remaining up for sale. In 1990, the format shifted to classical music, interrupted by sports broadcasts (including the return of Idaho football) which subsidized the remainder of the operation. =Closure= At noon on July 18, 1996, vandals broke in and caused in damage to the station's equipment, an act that turned out to be the end of KSVY. The station never resumed operations, though Orr paid for years to keep the tower beacons lit until the facility was finally dismantled in 2005. The license was officially canceled by the FCC on April 14, 1999.

When measuring production-based emissions, China emitted over 12 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2eq of greenhouse gases in 2014; almost 30% of the world total. This corresponds to over 7 tonnes CO2eq emitted per person each year, slightly over the world average and the EU average but less than half the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, with its 16 tonnes. In consumption terms, China emits slightly less, with over 6 tonnes in 2016, slightly above the world average, but less than the EU average (close to 8 tonnes) and less than the United States by more than a half, with close to 18 tonnes per person. China has committed to peak emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2060.  Greenhouse gas sources  Since 2000, rising emissions in China and the rest of world have eclipsed the output of the United States and Europe., Table 7. Per person, the United States generates carbon dioxide at a far faster rate than other primary regions. Since 2006, China has been the world's largest emitter of annually. China ratified the Kyoto Protocol as a non-Annex B party without binding targets, and ratified the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. As the world's largest coal producer and consumer country, China worked hard to change energy structure and experienced a decrease in coal consumption since 2013 to 2016. However, China, the United States and India, the three biggest coal users, have increased coal mining in 2017. The Chinese government has implemented several policies to control coal consumption, and boosted the usage of natural gas and electricity . Looking ahead, the construction and manufacturing industries of China will give way to the service industry, and the Chinese government will not set a higher goal for economic growth in 2018; thus coal consumption may not experience continuous growth in the next few years. The annual emissions of China were 10150.82 million tonnes in 2016, followed by the United States (5311.69 million tonnes) and India (2430.8 million tonnes). China is implementing some policies to mitigate the bad effects of climate change, most of which aim to constrain coal consumption. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of China set goals and committed to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 in the latest, and increase the use of non-fossil fuel energy carriers, taking up 20% of the total primary energy supply. If China successfully reached NDC's targets, the GHG emissions level would be 12.8‚Äì14.3 GtCO2e in 2030, reducing 64% to 70% of emission intensity below 2005 levels. China has surpassed solar deployment and wind energy deployment targets for 2020. Cumulative CO2 emissions of different countries (1970-2013) = Energy production =  Electricity generation  = Coal fired power stations = China's main power source is coal in China, which it mostly mines but also imports.  Transport fuel   Home energy  = Energy consumption = According to the 2016 Chinese Statistical Yearbook published by China's National Bureau of Statistics, China's energy consumption was 430,000 (10,000 tons of Standard Coal Equivalent), including 64% coal, 18.1% crude oil, 5.9% natural gas, and 12.0% primary electricity and other energy in 2016. The percentage of coal has decreased since 2011, and the percentage of crude oil, natural gas and primary electricity and other energy have increased since 2011. China experienced an increase in electricity demand and use in 2017 as the economy accelerated. According to the Climate Data Explorer published by World Resources Institute, China, the European Union and the U.S. contributed to more than 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2016, China's greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 26% of total global emissions. The energy industry has been the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions since the last decade. Although China has large countrywide emissions, its per capita carbon dioxide emissions are still lower than those of some other developed and developing countries. In 2007, China's per-capita emissions were 5.1 tons per person per year, compared to 19.4 in the U.S., 11.8 in Russia, and 8.6 in the EU 15. = Industry =  Cement   Iron and steel  = Agriculture = While the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions almost toward all the aspects of lives, the impact on agricultural production is likely to be particularly important. For example, the increment of temperature and decrease of precipitation has caused China a lower production of rice, wheat, and maize. On the opposite, China‚Äôs cotton production has increased. All these data technically does not responsible for the new technologies and new policies. ‚ÄúAccording to the World Resources Institute‚Äôs Climate Analysis Indicators Tool, the emission of greenhouse gas from agricultural sources constituted 15.4 percent of China‚Äôs total emission in 2005, behind only electricity, combustion, manufacturing, and construction‚Äù‚ÄúIPC Platform on Climate Change Agriculture and Trade.‚Äù ICTSD, 28 Oct. 2009, www.ictsd.org/themes/climate-and- energy/research/ictsd-ipc-platform-on-climate-change-agriculture-and-trade.. The main component of the emission that is coming out of the agricultural industry is nitrous oxide. The data indicates that agriculture has taken up a big portion of greenhouse emission in China, therefore, mitigating the agriculture emission has recently become the very first step to solve the problem. The main effect of overdosing greenhouse gas emission is the fact that it changes the global temperature causing dramatic climate changes. These changes sometimes can shift the time of season backward or frontward. Season changes can also affect crop productions from time to time. Some crops such as wheat and corn, heavily rely on season changes and temperature variations. With the change in temperature, it is both hard for farmers and crops to grow and harvest. Now the effects of climate change may not seem too obvious, are momentous and have become larger and larger each year.  Impacts  China‚Äôs agriculture sector is almost responsible for one-fifth of China‚Äôs total greenhouse gas emissions. While it is a significant amount, the main source of agricultural greenhouse gas emission is coming from the application of fertilizer. Other sources include excrement burning or pasture management are not as many as the fertilizer. Another element of causing greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector is methane. It mainly comes from livestock corpse and farm management. In some studies, accounting for the benefits of CO2 fertilization reduces the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields in a projected increase in yield. For example. the use of CO2 fertilization increases the production of most crops. Estimation of climate change's impacts on crop yields differs on a large scale depending on CO2 fertilization effects. However, this is not always the case. When a considerable CO2 fertilization effect is taken into account, yields actually increase except some crops such as rice and corn. China's grassland has faced a higher temperature situation in recent years, hence the drought is becoming more and more severe. The productivity of grassland has been low. In the future years, drought will be developing at a faster pace, and this phenomenon will remain the same or even worse on the farm unless China's government begins to adapt and make changes. Even though CO2 fertilization aggravates the scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, the method does have a significant impact on the production of crops.  Improvement  In order to improve the situation of pollution and climate change, China has made a huge step toward changing the environment. It will begin implementing projects to prevent agricultural source pollution such as water contamination and soil contamination. What's more, farmers, like the government, can use different methods for their farming system and irrigation system as well. For example, farmers have switched to use groundwater to maintain or improve productivity.  Fertilization  The extent of the changes in yields highly depends on crops that are using CO2 fertilization. Some crops, therefore, increase the production due to the CO2 fertilization, but the method itself does have some severe impacts on climate change. The crop that relies on natural methods does not get the benefits at all because the climate is affected by CO2 fertilization. This level of tradeoff and balances depends on the China government and farmers. = Waste = = Coal mine methane = China is by far the largest emitter of methane from coal mines.  Energy efficiency  In 2004, Premier Wen Jiabao promised to use an \\"iron hand\\" to make China more energy efficient. Energy efficiency improvements have somewhat offset increases in energy output as China continues to develop. Since 2006, the Chinese government has increased export taxes on energy-inefficient industries, reduced import tariffs on certain non-renewable energy resources, and closed down a number of inefficient power and industrial plants. In 2009, for example, for every two new plants (in terms of energy generation capacity) built, one inefficient plant was closed. China is unique in its closing of so many inefficient plants.  Targets  The targets laid out in China's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2016 will likely be met, but are not enough to properly combat global warming. China also established 10 binding environmental targets in its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). These include an aim to reduce carbon intensity by 18% by 2020, as well as a binding target for renewable energy at 15% of total energy, raised from under 12% in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan also set, for the first time, a cap on total energy use from all sources: no more than 5 billion tons of coal through 2020. Climate change mitigation A 2011 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report predicted that Chinese CO2 emissions will peak around 2030. This because in many areas such as infrastructure, housing, commercial building, appliances per household, fertilizers, and cement production a maximum intensity will be reached and replacement will take the place of new demand. The 2030 emissions peak also became China's pledge at the Paris COP21 summit. Carbon emission intensity may decrease as policies become strengthened and more effectively implemented, including by more effective financial incentives, and as less carbon intensive energy supplies are deployed. In a \\"baseline\\" computer model CO2 emissions were predicted to peak in 2033; in an \\"Accelerated Improvement Scenario\\" they were predicted to peak in 2027.ChinaFAQs: China's Energy and Carbon Emissions Outlook to 2050, ChinaFAQs on 12 May 2011, = International involvement = The People's Republic of China is an active participant in the climate change talks and other multilateral environmental negotiations, and claims to take environmental challenges seriously but is pushing for the developed world to help developing countries to a greater extent. However the Belt and Road Initiative is constructing coal-fired power stations (for example Emba Hunutlu power station in Turkey) thus increasing greenhouse gas emissions from other countries. = Carbon trading = China issued its first Climate Change Program in 2007, in response to its surpassing of the United States as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide emissions in the world. The Chinese national carbon trading scheme was later announced in November 2008 by the national government to enforce a compulsory carbon emission trading scheme across the country's provinces as part of its strategy to create a \\"low carbon civilisation\\". The scheme would allow provinces to earn money by investing in carbon capture systems in those regions that fail to invest in the technology. In 2011, the Chinese government announced the location of pilot systems for the proposed national carbon trading scheme. Since 2014, these projects have begun in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Guangdong, Hubei, and Chongqing. Each region's pilot covers different sectors (including cement and steel industries as well as other manufacturing and industrial sectors) and percentages of the region's emissions. Since August 2008, voluntary emissions trading among individual institutions has also begun in China. In 2017, China released specific details of its proposed national carbon market. This program would initially cover the country's power generation sector (which contributes to half of China's overall emissions), and within the power sector, only companies emitting 26,000 tons of carbon per year. Nathaniel Keohane, Vice President for Global Climate at the Environmental Defense Fund, said that this initial stage would cover 3.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. However, other major emitters like the automobile industry, the industrializing agricultural sector and its huge chemical complexes, steel mills, and cement factories, do not fall under the program in its initial period. The national carbon emissions trading scheme has no binding timeline for implementation; however, trading is projected to begin in 2020, with the establishment of basic infrastructure set to continue through 2018 and simulated trading in the power sector to begin in 2019. After 2020, trading will hypothetically expand to also cover 7 other sectors: petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, paper, and civil aviation, for a total of about 6,000 companies. = Renewable energy = With $34.6 billion invested in clean technology in 2009, China is the world's leading investor in wind turbines and other renewable energy technologies. China produces more wind turbines and solar panels each year than any other country.Bradsher, Keith, 30 January 2010, China leads global race to make clean energy , The New York Times Nuclear power is planned to be rapidly expanded. By mid-century fast neutron reactors are seen as the main nuclear power technology which allows much more efficient use of fuel resources.Nuclear Power in China, Updated March 2012, World Nuclear Association, http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf63.html China has also dictated tough new energy standards for lighting and gas kilometrage for cars. China could push electric cars to curb its dependence on imported petroleum (oil) and foreign automobile technology.  Economics  = Co-benefits = Like India, cutting greenhouse gas emissions together with air pollution in China, saves enough lives to easily cover the cost. = Impact of 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus outbreak = The slowdown in manufacturing, construction, transportation, and overall economic activity resulting from the 2019‚Äì20 coronavirus outbreak created a temporary reduction by \\"about a quarter\\" in China's greenhouse gas emissions.  Politics  although China is on course to meet its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement that target is not compatible with limiting global warming to 2 ¬∞C.  Debates  Both internationally and within the People's Republic of China, there has been an ongoing debate over China's economic responsibilities for climate change mitigation. The argument has been made that China has a crucial role to play in keeping global warming under 2 ¬∞C, and that this cannot be accomplished unless coal use, which accounts for the majority of China's emissions, falls sharply.

Since 1982, she has produced dozens of grant-funded documentaries through her nonprofit production company Affinityfilms, Inc., based in Anchorage.  Early life and career  Born in the mid-1950s and raised in southern Minnesota, Mary Rosanne Katzke learned filmmaking from her father, Gus, who first taught her the skills needed to make her first home movies and 8mm films. In 1981, she produced her first documentary film, No Word for Rape. The 16mm film about sexual assault in urban and rural Alaska won awards at film festivals in Seattle, Chicago and Anchorage, and was used by Alaska-based crisis center workers for at least a decade. In 1982, Katzke formed the nonprofit production company Affinityfilms, Inc. Katzke is a graduate of the Radio-Television-Film School at the University of Texas, Austin, and completed her Master of Fine Arts degree in Writing and Directing in 1992 on scholarship at New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Funders of her work have included the American Film Institute, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Alaska State Arts Council.  Influences  She has cited the work of American filmmaker and documentarian Frederick Wiseman as an important influence in her film making. One interviewer noted that, like in Wiseman's films, ‚ÄúKatzke‚Äôs films do not utilize voiceover narrations to highlight the story. Instead, she allows the subjects to tell their own stories through their actions and discourse with the camera.‚Äù In numerous interviews, she has also referenced being influenced by life events, including her mother's death of breast cancer in 1983 at age 52, and her own diagnosis, less than a decade later, in 1992.  Films by theme  Themes in her work have included the following (with representative examples): = Exploring sexual assault and domestic violence in Alaska = No Word for Rape (1981) - A documentary addressing sexual assault in urban and rural Alaska. Won awards at film festivals in Seattle and Chicago, as well as at the first All-Alaska Film Festival.

And Now We Rise (2019) Director, Producer - Biography of a young Athabascan hip-hop artist advocating to help displaced, homeless people in Alaska. ‚Äúa portrait of an exceptional young activist, Samuel Johns, motivated to help his Alaska Native community to lead sober, productive lives.\\"  Other work  In addition to her documentary work, Katzke has written a number of short stories, essays and feature film screenplays, and has been a periodic contributor of opinion pieces to the Anchorage Daily News. = Dancing for the Hunter = In 1988 she wrote a play, Dancing for the Hunter, based on the true-life stories of 17 women pursued and murdered by Alaskan serial killer (and former Anchorage baker) Robert Hansen. The project grew from interviews Katzke had begun while working on the documentary Fourth Avenue, when some of her subjects told her about a string of exotic dancers and who had recently disappeared \\"and how no one seemed to care.‚Äù Her script was drawn from audiotaped interviews she conducted with about 15 strippers during the year prior to Hansen's arrest. Katzke told an interviewer her approach was influenced by having viewed a Broadway production of The Exonerated: ‚Äú[S]he was particularly intrigued by the way actors-as- prisoners told their stories in monologue fashion, sitting on stools at the edge of a stage reading scripts perched on top of music stands.‚Äù[1] Dancing for the Hunter debuted at the 2005 Last Frontier Theatre Conference in Valdez, where it received notice, including a writeup in Backstage magazine, according to a blogger. Of a later reading in Anchorage, a critic wrote: ‚ÄúHer portraits of four lost souls who wander into the demimonde of strip clubs and prostitution have an authentic feel, as if they're backed up by hours and hours of interviews with dancers and call girls who lived through the Hansen era.‚Äù Katzke twice optioned a 1988 movie script about the killings and used it as part of her application for graduate film school, but the production has never been made into a movie. \\"Serial killer stories were out of fashion,‚Äù she told the Anchorage Daily News in 2005. On a side note, Alaskan actor Ron Holmstrom has cited an early role in Katzke‚Äôs play as possibly having helped him attain a role in the 2013 Nicolas Cage film The Frozen Ground, a movie thriller also based on the Hansen story. = A Monkey's Tale = In 2015, Katzke also co-authored the book, A Monkey‚Äôs Tale: a Novel, with Thillman Wallace.  Controversies  Two mentions of controversy have appeared in news coverage of Katzke's films: Fourth Avenue, produced in 1985, examined the impacts of a downtown beautification project on Anchorage‚Äôs homeless. \\"We upset a number of people with that film,\\" Katzke told an interviewer several years later. \\"The native people felt that by showing passed-out drunk native people we were racist, and we had slandered their culture in some way. The city officials felt that we had been unduly biased and sympathetic toward the native people. And so we got it from both sides, which made me think that we must have done a fair job.\\" Katzke's 1990 documentary Sea of Oil, which told about the human impact of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill on the community of Valdez, Alaska, almost didn't make it out of the state, after Exxon wrote the mayor to warn the film would tarnish the community's reputation. This effort, however, failed to prevent the film from being seen more widely, and in July 1991, Sea of Oil was featured as part of a 2-hour nationwide PBS \\"POV Showcase\\" special on the environment.  Honors and awards  Katzke's notable awards and honors have included: Winner, 1996 Minnesota Blockbuster McKnight Film Fund Competition \\\\- one of four recipients who split prize money of $75,000.

He has been vice-dean of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Antwerp, and was a visiting professor at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA (1987-1988), at the Universit√© Paris-Sud XI, Orsay (France, 1989) and at the University of Ghent (Belgium, 2013-2019). He officially retired in October 2019 and is now a visiting professor at the University of Antwerp (Belgium), a researcher at CzechGlobe Academy of Sciences in Brno (Czech Republic) and an international consultant to the Slovenian Forestry Institute (Ljubljana, Slovenia).  Issues of Study  His research focused primarily on ecophysiological responses of trees to increasing CO2 concentrations as well as on the use of poplar and willow plantations for bioenergy, which increased the understanding of the importance of natural ecosystems in managing the global environmental crises. = Renewable (bio-)energy production from poplar = Based on the improved knowledge of the biological aspects of productivity in poplar, he expanded his research after 1990 toward the production of bioenergy from poplar. He investigated the entire production chain, from the establishment of the biomass plantation to the final production of renewable energy. The focus was on the cultivation of poplar in intensively managed, high-density short rotation coppice (SRC). He brought the concept of producing bioenergy from SRC with fast-growing poplar trees to fruition and identified the principal yield determinants of poplar for bioenergy... In 2009, Ceulemans obtained an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council, POPFULL , to conduct a full system analysis of a bioenergy plantation. For the first time a full balance of all greenhouse gases (CO2 and the non-CO2 greenhouse gases as CH4 and N2O) as well as a full life cycle assessment were made during several rotations of an operational (20 ha) SRC plantation of poplars and willows https://doi.org/10.1016/J.RSER.2014.08.058; https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/iruaauth/43fc82/1da4fbcef6d.pdf. These research efforts proved the high potential of bioenergy from the plantation farm to the conversion plant, i.e. a climate change mitigation strategy and also became an ERC success story = Impact of global changes on plants and ecosystems = From 1990 onward Ceulemans extended his research to the response of poplar and other plants to global environmental changes. He quantified, measured and modeled the responses to the effects of elevated CO2 and climate warming using different techniques such as growth chambers, open- top chambers, Free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) within the framework of the European funded research programs POPFACE and EUROFACE. This work showed that plants profit from a rising atmospheric CO2 concentration with a mean biomass stimulation of 30%, but also indicated that acclimation counteracts and mitigates most of this stimulation = Biosphere ‚Äì atmosphere fluxes = Since 1996 his research group got actively involved in the quantification of fluxes between ecosystems and the atmosphere for a better understanding of ecosystem responses to global changes. He was an active participant in various European flux programs, incl. CARBO-EUROPE IP. From 2013-2019 Ceulemans was the Belgian Focal Point of the Integrated Carbon Observation System research infrastructure and coordinated the Belgian network of observation stations.  Leadership and director of Research Center of Excellence  From 2000-2019 Ceulemans led the Research Group of Plant and Vegetation Ecology (PLECO, Department of Biology, University of Antwerp). In 2007 the research group was recognized as a Research Center of Excellence at the University of Antwerp. As the Director of the Research Center, he also became the Methusalem titular with long-term funding from the Flemish Government through the University of Antwerp (2007-2019). He was Chairman of the Department of Biology (2004-2006), Vice Dean of the Faculty of Sciences (2006-2009) and Chair of various international evaluation and selection committees, including the European Science Foundation (ESF). Under his supervision a total of 28 PhD‚Äôs were defended.  Awards and Honors  In 1990, he received the Scientific Achievement Award of the International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) https://www.iufro.org/fileadmin/material/discover/honour-saa- recipients.pdf. During the academic year 2006-2007 he was titular of the Belgian Francqui Chair at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain (UCL). As a Francqui Chair he taught various courses and classes on forest ecophysiology, the ecology and genetics of poplar, plant ecology and related. He was elected a member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts (since 2009) On 27 April 2010, he received the academic title of Doctor Honoris Causa at Mendel University of Brno (Czech Republic)http://is.mendelu.cz/ds/slozka.pl?id=33531;download=141128 from the Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences.

After a decades- long administrative struggle, construction works are set to finally begin in 2021 and may only be completed by 2045. The project, if executed in its entirety following current plans, will reshape approximately 2.65 million square metres of land and create 241,700 new jobs. Timeline Mayor Manuela Carmena (2015‚Äì19) with Jos√© Luis √Åbalos, Antonio B√©jar, and Jos√© Manuel Calvo during the presentation of the final draft of the project in July 2018 The project was first conceived in 1993 by state-owned rail transport enterprise Renfe and the Spanish Ministry of Development, at the time primarily as an extension to Chamart√≠n railway station with subsequent rearrangement of the adjacent neighbourhoods. However, the project soon faced its first serious obstacles, as landowners fought their expropriation in court, a legal process that would ultimately take 15 years to be completed. The project's realization was further impeded when in 2004, tragedy struck in the form of the Madrid train bombings. Coincidentally, the attack took place on the exact same day the initial phase of the then-Operaci√≥n Chamart√≠n was to be approved, with an event of this scale being virtually the only thing that would still be able to deter the implementation of the plans. As the following years saw a general slowdown in urban construction projects due to the economic fallout of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, among those many previously planned extensions of the Metro network, Operaci√≥n Chamart√≠n once more had to take a back seat for several years. Only in 2015, after Manuela Carmena had won the municipal elections, was the project revitalized. Some tensions arose between the new mayor and a number of commercial partners like the bank BBVA, as the former insisted on adding more residential apartments and green spaces to the plans and would have rather kept the involvement of private contributors to a minimum, for a time promoting an alternative proposal which would have been significantly less ambitious, but also cheaper and faster to realize. However, as this iteration of the plan was rejected by both participating enterprises and legislative bodies, the parties involved ultimately came to a compromise that, while incorporating many of the proposed changes, remained largely faithful to the project's original scope, with its name being changed to Madrid Nuevo Norte. On 29 July 2019, the project was approved, receiving unanimous support from all parties represented in the Madrilenian townhall. With another round of mostly minor revisions to be implemented, the regional government under Isabel D√≠az Ayuso on their part approved it on 20 March 2020, with construction works set to begin in early 2021 as of July. In July 2020, the project was registered with both LEED and BREEAM, two notable certification programmes related to sustainability in urban planning. If successful, Madrid Nuevo Norte would become the first Spanish project to obtain either certification. Scope of the project Madrid Nuevo Norte stipulates the creation of 348 new office buildings and 11,700 apartments. Additionally, the skyline of the northern city's business district, which is currently still dominated by the Cuatro Torres, will receive at least three more skyscrapers at a height of 190 to more than 250 metres. At a projected height of approximately 330 metres, the highest of these buildings would become the tallest building in the European Union upon completion. In terms of public transport, the plans include a short additional metro line consisting of three stations, in conjunction with a novel priority bus line. A new Cercan√≠as station is also to be constructed, most likely above the northernmost of the metro stations. Chamart√≠n railway station will be significantly extended and modernized, turning it once more into the main reference point of the Spanish high velocity rail network AVE (which is currently thought to be Atocha in the south of Madrid). Reactions Common criticisms of the project have historically often focused on it having the potential to further increase already existing income disparities within the city proper, with southern districts like Villaverde and Usera being significantly less wealthy than their central and northern counterparts. , an architect and former socialist politician, criticized the programme for being a private venture rather than a public one, polemically calling for it to be renamed \\"\\" (BBVA's farmhouse). Echoing a chorus of more positive domestic and international voices, German business newspaper Handelsblatt has called the project a \\"key economic stimulus\\", citing a poll indicating overwhelming popular support for the project among Madrilenians. Lorena Vargas of T: The New York Times Style Magazine described it as an essential step to help Madrid catch up to other major European capitals like London or Paris.

It is located in Cairo, Egypt, in the Northern Cemetery which is a part of Cairo's historic necropolis districts. It is often considered one of the most accomplished works of Mamluk architecture in Cairo, and one of the major monuments of the Northern Cemetery district.  Historical background  An 1878 illustration of the complex, showing its profile from the back (eastern) side. The two large mausoleum domes are visible at the mosque's corners. The smaller dome in the middle stands above the mihrab area. Sultan Faraj's monument is considered by many, including Mamluk historians, to be one of the finest buildings of Mamluk architecture in Cairo. Its creation is considered all the more remarkable considering that Faraj's reign was characterized by political unrest, destruction, and economic difficulties. Faraj was unable to prevent devastating incursions by Timur (Tamerlane) into Syria (starting in 1400), and he was deposed briefly in 1405 before regaining the throne. His critics held him responsible for financial mismanagement, which drained the treasury, and for oppressive taxation. He was eventually deposed and assassinated in 1411, at the age of 23. The creation of this funerary complex was actually ordered by Faraj's father, Sultan Barquq, who expressed a desire to be buried in the desert close to the existing tombs of Islamic saints and scholars, instead of in the urban funerary complex he had built at Bayn al- Qasrayn in central Cairo. Barquq had already allocated a fund of 80,000 dinars for the task, which was carried out by his son and successor. Barquq himself was buried on this site upon his death in 1399, before the building itself was constructed. The building's location is in what is now known as the Northern Cemetery, one of the historic Cairo necropolises collectively known as the Qarafa. Today the area is dotted with other Mamluk tombs from the Burji period and is filled with other cemeteries as well as modern residential buildings. At the time of the building's construction, however, this area was largely empty and uninhabited (or sparsely inhabited) desert land outside the city. There was nonetheless an important caravan road here which was part of the road to Mecca, which meant that travelers still regularly passed through the area. Faraj's funerary complex, a khanqah with facilities for its residents, was intended to encourage urbanization of this area. Faraj originally intended to establish some marketplaces here and build other facilities, but this process never fully took place, perhaps in part because of his early death. Sultan Qaytbay made a similar attempt nearby with his own funerary complex later that century, which was described as a \\"royal suburb\\", but urbanization of the surrounding area never fully occurred until much later.  Construction  The supervisor of construction is named as amir Lajin al-Turuntay, likely appointed by Faraj, although Barquq had previously appointed amir Yunus al- Dawadar to this role. The timeline of construction is largely known according to official inscriptions found on the building. The northern mausoleum chamber, where Faraj and his father Barquq are buried, has an inscription dating it to 1400-01 (803 AH) and attributing it to Faraj acting on the orders of Barquq. A second inscription there states that it was completed in 1405 by Sultan Abd-al Aziz, another son of Barquq who briefly replaced Faraj as sultan that year. Faraj returned to the throne and eventually completed the building in 1410-1411 (813 AH). The southern mausoleum was the last part to be finished, while the mosque area in between the mausoleums was likely finished earlier. This was a long construction period by Mamluk standards, but the chaos and interruptions of Faraj's reign are most likely the reason for this.  Architecture  The central courtyard, looking towards the prayer hall (center) and the mausoleums (the large domes on the left and right). kuttabs (left). The southern mausoleum chamber. = Overview and layout = The complex was designated primarily as a khanqah (a residence and center for Sufis). It is centered around a large central courtyard, surrounded by living quarters to the west and adjoining a prayer hall or mosque section to the east, which in turn is flanked by two large mausoleums on either side. The complex also features two minarets, two sabils (water dispensaries), and two kuttabs (primary schools) in an almost symmetrical arrangement on its western facade. The overall layout is similar to that of a regular congregational mosque, which is indeed a function that the building also served. The complex has a nearly square floor plan measuring 72 meters by 73 meters. Its broad symmetrical layout is rare in the Mamluk era, as sultans and amirs most frequently built their complexes in the city, where space restrictions required inventive and asymmetrical floor plans in order to accommodate their surroundings. The fact that Faraj's complex was built in the open desert outside the city allowed for this fairly unique monument which makes full use of the space: two mausoleums are spread to either side at the mosque section's eastern corners, and two minarets stand apart from each other above the eastern facade. The placement of the domed mausoleums at these corners made them fully visible to travelers passing along the road, while at the same time making them easily accessible to those praying in the mosque inside. This made it easier for both visitors inside and passers-by outside to offer prayers to the deceased sultan and his family buried here; a consideration which was often important in the placement of Mamluk tombs. The building has two entrances, one next to each kuttab, though the southwestern one is the most publicly accessible entrance today. The southwestern entrance also presents the only notable asymmetry in the architectural layout; instead of being integrated into the main square floor plan of the building, it projects outwards from the rest of the building and is attached to small square chamber which seemed to have been intended as a reception hall. = The mausoleums and their domes = The large stone domes of the mausoleums represent an important step in the development of Mamluk architecture and a high point of Mamluk engineering. They are the earliest large domes in Cairo to be made of stone (earlier ones were usually in wood). In fact, they remain the largest stone domes of the Mamluk period in Cairo, with a diameter of 14.3 meters. The northern mausoleum chamber contains the tombs of both Sultan Barquq and Sultan Faraj (ibn Barquq), while the southern mausoleum chamber is dedicated to the tombs of female relatives. Both mausoleum chambers are decorated with marble paneling, their own mihrab (niche indicating the direction of prayer), and a large inscription band along the wall. The dome ceilings are also painted. = The prayer hall = The prayer hall. The mosque area is comparatively plain, but is also characterized by its uncommon stonework. Instead of the usual wooden ceiling found elsewhere in most Mamluk (or Cairene) mosques, the ceiling is composed of stone vaults, with a small higher dome rising right in front of the mihrab. A stone dikka (reading platform) also stands at the edge of the prayer hall. The minbar is also made of stone and features excellent craftsmanship with carved geometric patterns, though it is a later donation from Sultan Qaytbay in 1483 and reflects the artistic quality of that time.

As one of China's first test pilots, he conducted the 1958 maiden flight of the Shenyang JJ-1, China's first indigenously developed jet aircraft. He later served as Commander of the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force from 1982 to 1985, Deputy Commander of the PLAAF from 1985 to 1994, and Commander of the PLAAF from 1994 to 1996.  Early life  Yu Zhenwu was born in July 1931 in Kuandian, Liaoning, Republic of China. He enlisted in the army in December 1947 and joined the Communist Party of China in August 1949. After the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) was established, Yu transferred to the PLAAF and trained to become a fighter pilot. He was deployed in North Korea in the last few months of the Korean War.  Test pilot  In 1958, Xu Shunshou at Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (then known as the 112 Factory) developed the Shenyang JJ-1, the first jet aircraft designed in China. After the first model crashed during a test flight, Yu, one of the top fighter pilots in the air force, was selected for the dangerous job as the test pilot for the second plane. On 26 July 1958, Yu successfully completed the maiden flight of the JJ-1, which has since been celebrated as a landmark in the history of Chinese aviation. In August 1958, Yu performed an air show at the celebration ceremony for the successful development of the JJ-1, which was attended by Marshal Ye Jianying and the PLAAF Commander Liu Yalou. In 2004, China Central Television aired the documentary The Secrets of China's War Eagles (‰∏≠ÂõΩÊàòÈπ∞Êé¢Áßò), which includes an interview with Yu, to commemorate the maiden flight of the JJ-1.  Commander of Guangzhou MRAF and PLAAF  Yu later served as Director of the Training Department of the PLAAF headquarters. In 1982, he succeeded Wang Hai as Commander of the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force (MRAF). When Wang was promoted to Commander of the PLAAF in July 1985, Yu was appointed his deputy and placed in charge of schools, training, and maintenance. He subsequently served as deputy commander under Wang's successor Cao Shuangming. He was the youngest but highest ranking deputy under both Wang and Cao. The other two deputy commanders, Lin Hu and Yang Zhenyu, both had served as commandant or deputy commandant of the PLAAF Command College. The choice of the three deputy commanders reflected the PLAAF's emphasis on training. In November 1994, Yu was appointed Commander of the PLAAF, replacing Cao Shuangming. He was the first post-Korean War veteran to serve as commander. He visited the United States in May 1995, but it was aborted by the People's Republic of China government when Lee Teng-hui, the President of the Republic of China on Taiwan, visited the US in spite of Beijing's protest. Yu attained the rank of full general in January 1996, and was elected an alternate member of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He served two years as PLAAF commander before being replaced by Liu Shunyao in December 1996.

In 1929 he, Schwesig, , , Julo Levin, and the actor/director Wolfgang Langhoff created the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (known in German as ASSO). After Hitler's rise to power in 1933, his paintings were classified as \\"degenerate art\\" and banned from being shown in public.Datenbank beschlagnahmte Kunst: Peter Ludwgs, from the Datenbank zum Beschlagnahmeinventar der Aktion \\"Entartete Kunst\\", Forschungsstelle \\"Entartete Kunst\\", FU Berlin Cut off from his livelihood and increasingly impoverished, he joined the Resistance and distributed illegal Communist pamphlets. He also became part of a group of Anti-fascist artists in D√ºsseldorf, who offered each other mutual financial support and protection, centered around the painter, Otto Pankok. His activities put him under constant surveillance by the Gestapo and he was arrested in 1937, on suspicion of high treason, but released in 1938. In February, 1943, he was arrested again and sent to , where he was assigned to a labor gang doing heavy road-clearing work.

Brandt (born 1961) is an American composer, academic, and writer. He is Professor of Composition and Theory at Rice University's Shepherd School of Music and the co-author with neuroscientist David Eagleman of the 2017 book The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World. As a composer, his works include two chamber operas, an oratorio, and orchestral, chamber, and vocal music. Life and career Brandt was born and raised in New York City. His father, Nathan, was a history writer and an editor for American Heritage and Publishers Weekly. His mother, Yanna, was a television producer. His maternal grandfather, Boris Kroyt was a violinist (and later violist) who was a member of the Budapest String Quartet. Brandt began studying the violin at the age of seven and during his teenage years spent six summers at the Bowdoin International Music Festival where he had further training in the violin under Lewis Kaplan and took his first steps as a composer. Brandt received his B.A. from Harvard University in 1983. After his graduation he spent a year in Paris studying on a fellowship at the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM). On his return, he enrolled in the California Institute of the Arts where he studied composition under Mel Powell and received his M.A. in 1987. He continued his composition studies with Earl Kim at Harvard, receiving his Ph.D. in 1994. His doctoral composition was Septet-a-Tete for flute, bass clarinet, two percussion, piano, violin, and cello. In 1994 he also received a Tanglewood fellowship. Brandt held visiting lectureships at Harvard, Tufts, and MIT before joining the faculty of Rice University's Shepherd School of Music in 1998 as an assistant professor. He has remained at Shepherd ever since, eventually rising to a full professorship and becoming the school's Chair of Composition and Theory. Among Brandt's compositions are two chamber operas, an oratorio, and orchestral, chamber, and vocal music. One of his early commissions was from the Koussevitzky Foundation to compose a new string quartet for the FLUX Quartet, an ensemble specializing in contemporary music. His first chamber opera, The Birth of Something with a libretto by Will Eno, premiered on 24 February 2006 at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston. It was subsequently recorded on the Albany Records label along with Brandt's The Dragon and the Undying for soprano and string quartet set to a poem by Siegfried Sassoon (a commission from the Bowdoin International Music Festival to celebrate its 40th anniversary) and the song cycle Creeley Songs for soprano and piano set to poems by Robert Creeley. His oratorio Maternity with a libretto by neuroscientist David Eagleman was premiered in 2012 by the River Oaks Chamber Orchestra who had commissioned the work. Brandt is also the artistic director of Musiqa, non- profit organization dedicated to the performance of contemporary classical music, which he co-founded in 2002. In 2013, Musiqa was a recipient of the ASCAP Adventurous Programming Award. In addition to their collaboration on Maternity, David Eagleman and Brandt are the co-authors of the 2017 book The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World, described in Nature as \\"a lively exploration of the software our brains run in search of the mother lode of invention\\". Brandt is also a co-investigator in an NEA-funded research lab at Rice University which is \\"measuring the effects of music- making and music engagement on cognitive and social-emotional well-being.\\" Brandt is married to the soprano and educator Karol Bennett. They met during his time as a Ph.D. student at Harvard. Both were performing a concert by the Griffin Music Ensemble, a Boston-based contemporary music ensemble of which Brandt was a founding member.

The episode sees Connor depart Med after Ava kills herself in front of him. Series showrunners Andy Schneider and Diane Frolov said the scene in which Dr. Bekker takes her own life was the \\"ultimate revenge against the man that had rejected her.\\" Her death pushes Connor to leave Med, as he will always be reminded of everything that happened. Schneider and Frolov confirmed that the ending means Donnell could return to the show in the future. The season premiere also begins several ongoing storylines for the show's regulars. Dr. Natalie Manning (Torrey DeVitto) will be dealing with a traumatic brain injury she sustained in the season 4 finale. A time gap occurs between the first and second episodes, in which Natalie recovers and returns to work. Schneider and Frolov said the injury would prompt questions about Natalie's ability to do her job well. They also confirmed that Natalie's memory will return and the audience will find out what she was planning on telling Will before the crash. Following a pregnancy scare for Dr. Choi (Brian Tee) and Nurse April Sexton (Yaya DaCosta) in the first episode, the idea of having a child is \\"definitely part of their storyline.\\" Meanwhile, Maggie Lockwood (Marlyne Barrett) is diagnosed with breast cancer and her treatment is a long-running storyline, which showcases new technology available to cancer patients.

Executive producer Derek Haas explained that after the seventh season, they were not sure how they would handle the conclusion to the mattress factory fire. They realised that they had placed characters in danger before having them saved too many times. Haas continued, \\"The audience has to be reminded that these calls are dangerous and sometimes people don't make it. We thought, what if we killed off Otis and he dies heroically? We realized there was so much emotional landscape we could cover.\\" Haas spoke with Chicago creator Dick Wolf about the decision first, before informing Sardarov that he was being written out. Sardarov agreed to return for the eighth season premiere. Haas confirmed that he considered killing off Darren Ritter (Daniel Kyri), but as he was only introduced in the seventh season, his death would not have the same impact as an original cast member. Otis' death also gave the writers the chance to script a memorial at the firehouse which had not been done in the series before. Haas hoped that Sardarov would agree to reprise the role for future appearances. Another ongoing storyline follows Paramedic Sylvie Brett (Kara Killmer), who has left Chicago with her fianc√© Kyle Sheffield (Teddy Sears) for a small town in Indiana. Haas wanted \\"to follow through with her agreeing to marry Kyle.\\" He also wanted to bring back her former friend Hope Jacquinot (Eloise Mumford) for the storyline. Actor Alberto Rosende joins the cast in the recurring role of firefighter Blake Gallo. Haas said the show needed \\"fresh energy\\" and called the character a \\"junior Casey/junior Severide\\". He added that not everyone in the house is keen on bringing Blake in. On December 13, 2019 it was announced that Rosende was upped to a series regular.

His art works with the urban environment and iconography of the city of Prague. His inventions frequently focus on contemporary social topics, and regularly address issues surrounding public space. Epos 257‚Äôs identity has remained unknown as of 2019.  Life  Born in the 1980s in Prague, Epos 257 started his career as a graffiti artist; some influence from those days can still be seen in his work. Epos 257 is a graduate of the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design, and a member of the interdisciplinary group Ztohoven.  Works  Epos 257's art is characterized by examination of public space, especially the way it is used and the limits of what is and isn‚Äôt public. He repeatedly challenges the creation in public with its institutional conception. He has created five solo and several collective exhibitions. = Hay = In 2009, Epos 257 anonymously placed more than thirty bales of hay around the center of Prague. However, his actions were subsequently interpreted by the media as a public threat, and even terrorism. After some time, he was approached by the National Theater in Prague about an exposition, and repeated his Hay exhibit on the theater's piazza (renamed to V√°clav Havel Square). However, that time he obtained all of the required permits. = 50 Square Meters of Public Space = In 2010, Epos 257 continued to deal with the boundaries of public space, even in the context of legislation. He put up a fence around 50 square meters of space in Palackeho Square, where there is an exception to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice (and is therefore referred to as the \\"Czech Hyde Park‚Äù). Nothing was placed inside of the enclosed space. The exhibit lasted for 54 days on the square, after which Epos himself contacted city officials. This work was intended to point out the indifference to the use of public space and the unfairness of certain restrictions associated with it. = Portrait = Epos 257 has also repeatedly created billboards. In the Portrait project, he framed giant cut-outs of the smiling faces of the final candidates for the 2013 Czech presidential election. While he left the remains of the promotional posters without the politician's faces in the original location, Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. He then went on to place a gigantic portrait of the election winner Milo≈° Zeman in the Czech National Library of Technology.  Controversies  It was mainly because of his ‚Äúbillboard‚Äù projects that Epos 257 was associated with breaking the law. His actions before the presidential and municipal elections also revived the debate on the ethical boundaries of artistic creation.

Formerly the church of a rich Benedictine abbey founded in 726, it is surrounded by buildings and ruins that had once belonged to the same order. Thanks to its Romanesque parts, the church is a stage on the Romanesque Road of Alsace. It is classified as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1840, making it a part of the very first list of such heritage buildings. Architecture The church's exterior architecture is strikingly clear-cut, insofar as its visible parts are growing younger from East to West, or older from West to East. The purely Romanesque superposed chapels behind the choir date from the 11th century; the choir itself, the transept and the easternmost bay of the nave date from the late 12th and early 13th century and reflect a transitional style between Romanesque and Gothic architecture; the rest of the nave was rebuilt later in the 13th century, in a sober but well defined Gothic style; while the facade with its porch tower was rebuilt between 1768 and 1773 in the Louis Quinze style. The crossing tower was modified by architect √âmile Boeswillwald during a restoration campaign in the years 1852‚Äì1858. Interestingly, the former church of the nearby Marmoutier Abbey has an identical architectural history, but in reverse: the western part is Romanesque, the nave is Gothic and the choir was rebuilt in the 18th century. Each church also has a crypt that is even older than the surfacing parts (in Neuwiller's case, it dates from the 9th century). Inside, the choir is separated from the rear chapels by a wall that appears to shorten the visible space: while the whole building's length is , the total combined length of nave, transept and choir is only . Description The church holds the relics of Saint Adelphus since the first half of the 9th century. In the Middle Ages, these relics had become so popular with pilgrims that the Benedictines built a second church nearby (1190‚Äì1225, now the village's Protestant church) specially to serve as a shrine, so as to remain undisturbed in their own sanctuary. The reliquary of Saint Adelphus was later moved back into Saint- Pierre-et-Saint-Paul in the 19th century, after the dissolution of the abbey following the French Revolution. Among the many works of art inside the former abbey church, the four, early 16th-century tapestries depicting the life and the miracles of Adelphus, on display in the upper of the superposed Romanesque chapels (dedicated to Saint Sebastian), are perhaps the most notable. A strikingly gory scene depicts a knight being forced by divine wrath to devour his own hand after having tried to break the saint's sarcophagus. The 12th- century baptismal fonts, the 14th-century statue of the Virgin and Child, the 1478 Entombment of Christ, and the 18th-century carved choir stalls are also especially noteworthy. All these objects are classified as Monuments historiques.

He is the founder and chief executive of Banda, a property development and interior design company. He is married to Princess Beatrice, a granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II. Background Mapelli Mozzi was born at the Portland Hospital in West End, London. The Times (22 November 1983). page 26 He is the son of Alessandro \\"Alex\\" Mapelli-Mozzi, British Olympian and member of an Italian noble family whose ancestral seat is the Villa Mapelli Mozzi in the Bergamo province of Italy. The BBC describe Mapelli Mozzi as being a count. The title was given to his family in the nobility of Italy in 1913 by King Victor Emmanuel III to all male descendants imposing the surname and noble family of Mozzi and is incorporated to the family of Mapelli. Mapelli Mozzi's mother is Nicola \\"Nikki\\" Williams-Ellis MBE (n√©e Nicola Diana Burrows), granddaughter of Sir Robert Abraham Burrows. She was later married to businessman and Conservative politician Christopher Shale until his death in 2011. In 2017, she married the sculptor David Williams-Ellis. Mapelli Mozzi has an older sister, Natalia Alice Yeomans (born 1981), and a younger half- brother, Alby Shale (born 1991). Career Mapelli Mozzi attended Radley College before obtaining an M.A. in politics - at the University of Edinburgh. At the age of 23, with the support of his family, he started Banda, a property development and interior design company, which claims to develop homes in \\"undervalued\\" parts of London. This has been challenged by property experts on Twitter and Forbes, who argue that \\"there is nothing undervalued in Notting Hill\\", where Mapelli Mozzi's latest project is located, and describe the district as \\"a super prime residential destination\\". Mapelli Mozzi holds directorships in a number of companies, some of them with his mother, Nikki Williams-Ellis, and his brother-in-law, Tod Yeomans. Ahead of the 2016 London mayoral election, Mapelli Mozzi wrote an article for Property Week, urging the future mayor to insist on redevelopment projects in central London. He has also criticised politicians Andrea Leadsom and Jeremy Corbyn. =Cricket Builds Hope= Mapelli Mozzi is a co-founder of the British-Rwandan charity \\"Cricket Builds Hope\\", which aims to use cricket as \\"a tool for positive social change\\" in Rwanda. Previously known as the Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation (RCSF), the charity was founded in 2011 to build Rwanda's first grass wicket cricket ground, now known as Gahanga International Cricket Stadium. Mapelli Mozzi's stepfather Christopher Shale came up with the idea for the charity but died before he could get it off the ground. Shale's family and friends set up the foundation after his death; Mapelli Mozzi's half- brother, Alby Shale, is on the board of trustees. The charity's patrons are Jonathan Agnew, Brian Lara, Heather Knight, Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent, Sam Billings and Makhaya Ntini. In 2012, Mapelli Mozzi cycled overnight in London in the Nightrider Challenge to raise funds for the foundation. Personal life Mapelli Mozzi was engaged to American architect Dara Huang until 2018. They have a son, Christopher Woolf, born in 2016. In 2018, Mapelli Mozzi started a relationship with Princess Beatrice of York, whom he had known since childhood. His family have been close friends with her parents, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York, for decades. Following his proposal in Italy, the couple's engagement was announced on 26 September 2019. Mapelli Mozzi was reported to have designed the engagement ring along with British jeweller Shaun Leane. They intended to marry at the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace on 29 May 2020 but postponed the ceremony in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A private wedding took place at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park on 17 July 2020.

Vujiƒá (; 26 October 1853 ‚Äî 1 March 1913) was a Serbian politician, ambassador, professor of economics, philosopher, historian and academic. He was one of the most notable Serbian economists during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Biography He completed a gymnasium and received his post-graduate degree in economics at Belgrade's Grandes √©coles. Vujiƒá continued his post-graduate studies in finance, economics and philosophy at the University of Leipzig, where he received a Ph.D. in 1879. Shortly after returning from his studies to Serbia, he joined the moderate wing of the People's Radical Party. From 1879 to 1887 Vujiƒá taught economics at his alma mater, alongside with two other well-known professors, Konstantin Cukiƒá and ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá. He first became Minister of Finance in the liberal-radical government of Jovan Ristiƒá in mid-1887, and at the end of the same year, he transferred to the radical government of Sava Grujiƒá. He was then Minister of Finance in a total of five governments. As Minister of Finance, Vujiƒá eliminated the monopoly of tobacco and salt and put a stop to the exploitation of the Serbian railway system, which until then had been in the hands of foreign companies. He sorted out the finances of the state, bringing the budget from large deficits to balancing the books by 1891. He tried to convert all of Serbia's foreign loans to reduce the burden of repayment. After King Alexander Obrenoviƒá's controversial marriage to Draga Ma≈°in, Vujiƒá became an ambassador in Paris. Already in February 1901, Vujiƒá was Foreign Minister in the government of Aleksa Jovanoviƒá, and shortly thereafter (March 20, 1901) he formed his own government and the portfolio of the Foreign Minister. This government was a coalition of forward-radicals and other parties. The reconciliation of Vujiƒá and other moderate radicals caused a split in the Radical Party, from which the younger and more combative elements stood out and formed a new party of Independent Radicals. Vujiƒá's government fell on 7 November 1902. In the following years, Vujiƒá was Serbia's ambassador in Vienna in 1903, Berlin in 1906 and Rome in 1909. Vujiƒá was elected a full member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1901. Works Mihailo V. Vujiƒá is best known for his first scientific treatise of Benedetto Cotrugli's \\"About Commerce and the Perfect Merchant\\", a lively account of the life of a Ragusian merchant in the Early Renaissance. Cotrugli gave an early description of the double-entry bookkeeping system. Vujiƒá's translation is a scholarly analysis of Kotruljeviƒá's work that places the four books into its proper historical context, making it an important contribution to our understanding of the origins of management and trade practices in the eastern shores of the Adriatic Sea during 15th century Ragusa. In philosophy, he belonged to the Kantian direction. Vujiƒá also wrote and published: *Naƒçela narodne ekonomije: Osnovna pethodna pitanja *Istorijski razvitak nauke o narodnoj privredi, Book I (1895) *Ekonomo-politiƒçki pogledi Dubrovƒçanina Nikole Vida Gucetica iz druge polovine 16-tog. veka (1900) *Na≈°a ekonomna politika See also * ƒêorƒëe Simiƒá  References  Category:Finance ministers of Serbia Category:Government ministers of Serbia Category:19th-century Serbian people Category:1853 births Category:1913 deaths ","title":"Mihailo V.

They formed in 2016 and on 20 September 2019 released their first full length studio album, Logos, via Pure Noise Records. Their sound has been described as alternative rock combining Simple Plan‚Äôs pop punk with Mallory Knox's heavier sounds.  History  Lead singer Alex Biro started the group in 2015, after parting ways with his old band in Los Angeles and moving back to his parents' basement, where he began working on new music. The other members joined a year later in the summer of 2016. The band's name is a reference to the lyrics of Jimmy Eat World's song \\"23\\". \\"I was deciding whether I still wanted to play music and I heard that line and thought it was beautiful\\", recalls Biro. On 25 July 2015, Selfish Things released their debut single, \\"Spooky Action at a Distance\\". The song is about dealing with suffering and self-hate, \\"for anyone who‚Äôs desired the truth, longed to be loved or searched endlessly for themselves\\". On 14 June 2016, they premiered the single \\"Good Morning, Miss America\\", and \\"We All Die Young (Oh My Southern Guard Flew West)\\" on 25 August. In September 2017, the band supported Simple Plan on a Canadian tour. After teasing fans with the EP Six Songs in December 2017, they released the EP Vertical Love on 16 March 2018. It was produced by James Paul Wisner, who worked with Paramore and Dashboard Confessional, and the artwork was created by Daniel P. Carter, host of the BBC Radio 1's Rock Show. Including singles \\"1435\\", \\"Rust Cohle Never Sleeps\\", \\"8147 Mulholland Terrace\\" and \\"Hangman\\", the EP was inspired by HBO series True Detective. Alex Biro stated that he \\"spent day after day watching and eventually emulating the ideological values Rust Cohle portrayed throughout the series. His nihilism, egoistic sense of identity and viewpoint on people of lesser ‚Äúintellect‚Äù fed my shadow self\\". In May 2018, Selfish Things played at Slam Dunk Festival in the UK, and in July/August they joined The Spill Canvas for a North American tour. On 25 May 2018, they released the EP Vertical Love // Reimagined, with different versions of three tracks previously included in Vertical Love, and a cover of Drake's song \\"Marvin's Room\\". On 26 October 2018, the band premiered a new single, \\"Flood\\", along with a music video. About the song, Alex Biro said \\"I felt like I needed to find a way to talk about human complacency in the face of destruction beyond gun violence. Our species has this off-putting, innate ability to let things go to shit so long as it doesn‚Äôt directly impact us as individuals.\\" On 22 February 2019, they released \\"Drained\\", a song featuring William Ryan Key (former lead singer of Yellowcard), and they also joined him for a tour across the US the following month. On 26 June 2019, they revealed the single \\"Pride\\" with an exclusive premiere on Kerrang!. According to Biro, the song \\"defines what it feels like to be the odd man out in a place you don‚Äôt belong\\". At the beginning of August, the band announced that they completed the recording of their first full-length album, and they premiered the single \\"Hole\\". Logos was released on 20 September 2019 via Pure Noise Records, and it was preceded by the single \\"Blood\\", that features Andy Leo of Crown the Empire.
