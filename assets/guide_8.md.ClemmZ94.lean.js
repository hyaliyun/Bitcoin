Sorensen is known for her sculptural work. Her sculptures and multimedia installations mimic geological formations and natural landscapes, and are made from clay, metal, and resin. Sorensen works from two art studios located in Snowmass Village, Colorado and Winter Park, Florida. Past exhibitions of Sorensen's artwork include a traveling retrospective called Topographies that was exhibited at the Orlando Museum of Art in January 2012, and a solo exhibition called Barbara Sorensen: Elemental at the Racine Art Museum in Racine, Wisconsin in 2013.  Background  Sorensen grew up in Racine, Wisconsin. She studied as an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where her adviser was ceramic artist, Don Reitz. In 1969, Sorensen received her Bachelor of Science degree in Art education. Sorensen worked as an art teacher from 1968 ‚Äì 1971. Starting in 1972, Sorensen worked alongside mentors and renowned ceramic artists Rudy Autio, Paul Soldner, Peter Voulkos, as well as former college adviser, Don Reitz.  Artwork  Sorensen makes sculptures and multimedia installations from clay, resin, and metal. Sorensen draws artistic inspiration from the natural world and classical elements.\\"Barbara Sorensen\\". (May 2004). Ceramics Monthly, p.18. Sorensen is known for going on hiking adventures in New Zealand, Australia, and the Pyrenees, and from these explorations, Sorensen cultivates her artistic vision. Sorensen often uses the clay slab method in her clay-based sculptural works.Robert, Tersa E. (September 1997). \\"Barbara Sorensen\\". Ceramics Monthly, p.14. In keeping with her interest in the natural environment, the clay slab method closely mimics geological phenomena, including plate tectonics. As Sorensen's work mimics geological phenomena, art critics, including Eleanor Heartney of Art in America, have noted that there is an inherent energy in Sorensen's sculptures and installations. Sorensen began her art career working in clay, and as time has gone on, she has moved towards creating sculptures and large scale sculptural installations with metal and resin, an example being her Dwellings series. The Dwellings sculptures are large, brightly colored aluminum wire vessels.  Installation Art  In addition to her singular sculptural works, Sorensen creates multimedia installations. Her Foothills installation includes music, video, and sixteen large clay sculptures. The music for the installation was composed by Stella Sung, and the video was created by David Hiser. The Speleothems installation made its premier at the Topographies retrospective at the Orlando Museum of Art. The sculptures that make up the Speleothems installation take their form from stalactite and stalagmite formations found in caves.  Artist Statement  Sorensen's artist statement describes her inspiration for creating artwork, and is as follows: ‚ÄúI instinctively respond to the form, surface and texture of the Earth, echoing them in my work. I look at the landscape, interpret and reinterpret it, processing it within, and give it back, transformed.‚Äù  Exhibits  In 2012, the Orlando Museum of Art mounted a retrospective of Sorensen's work called Topographies. The solo exhibition highlighted a twenty-year period of Sorensen's artwork, and focused on her resin and metal installations. A traveling exhibition, Topographies was also shown at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild in Pittsburgh, the Leepa-Rattner Museum of Art in Tarpon Springs, Florida, the Museum of Florida Art, and the Orlando Museum of Art. Past exhibitions include a solo show at the Wichita Center for the Arts in Wichita, Kansas in 2012 called Barbara Sorensen, and at the Racine Art Museum in Racine, Wisconsin in 2013 called Barbara Sorensen: Elemental. Past group exhibitions include the XX-XY/Gender Representation in Art at the Orlando Museum of Art in 2010, and Finding Balance at the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft in Houston, Texas in 2006.

He published more than 55 articles in peer-reviewed journals, edited two textbooks and contributed chapters in spinal surgery textbooks. He lectured worldwide in the field of minimally invasive spinal surgery. His research and development in this specialty began in 1970.  Biography Kambin was born in Tehran, Iran on May 21, 1931. He received his doctorate degree in medicine from Tehran University Faculty of Medicine in 1956. He continued his post-graduate training as an intern at St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center. He then did a four-year residency at New Jersey Orthopaedic Hospital and New York University, and received his American Board Certification in Orthopaedic Surgery in 1965. Kambin was a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery and has established an Endowed Chair of Spinal Surgery at Drexel University, College of Medicine. He was recognized by the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and his work in part has been exhibited in the Mutter Museum. Together with several colleagues, he assisted in the establishment of the International Society for Minimal Intervention in Spinal Surgery in 1988 and was elected the first president of the society in 1990. He coined the term \\"minimally invasive spinal surgery\\" and is credited in the Dorland's Medical Dictionary for describing the \\"Kambin triangular working zone\\".

Kambin's early experimental work with the debulking of the nuclear mass began in 1970. By utilising a series of cadaveric studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia, he developed instruments and described the anatomy and the path of the lateral access to the spinal canal for access and removal of herniated disc fragments. Demonstration of Kambin triangular working zone on a spine model He subsequently began his experimental work on the efficacy of the postero-lateral access to herniated lumbar discs. Kambin's preliminary study of nine patients who underwent lateral discectomy was published in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research in April 1983, and is considered to be the first publication on this subject in western literature. He is also credited with 34 US and European patents in the field of minimally invasive spinal surgery.

Shepperd from the UK, a desire to establish an international society dedicated to the research and teaching of the emerging technology was expressed. Dr. Hijikata from Toden Hospital, Japan, had described the removal of nuclear tissue from the intervertebral disc (nucleotomy) for the treatment of herniated discs in 1975. Professor Schreiber adopted this technique and utilized the procedure in his practice. Kambin resisted the term \\"nucleotomy\\" in the title of the newly formed society. He believed that the dislodged herniated disc fragments should be accessed and removed. Kambin was elected the first President of the newly organized society. He coined the term \\"minimal intervention in spinal surgery\\" by registering the society as a nonprofit organization dedicated to education and research in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The name \\"International Society for Minimal Intervention in Spinal Surgery\\" (ISMISS) was established on April 10, 1990. His first textbook, Arthroscopic Microdiscectomy, Minimal Intervention in Spinal Surgery, was published in 1991. The Society was formed under the auspices of the Soci√©t√© Internationale de Chirurgie Orthop√©dique et de Traumatologie (International Society of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology). Teaching Parviz Kambin remained an active member of the Graduate Hospital, where he served patients, taught and did research for more than 30 years. Subsequently, he accepted a full-time academic position at the Drexel University College of Medicine where he continued with his research and patient care. He has also contributed to the Parviz Kambin Lectureship at the Philadelphia Orthopaedic Society, where annually renowned spine surgeons present their work to the Philadelphia orthopaedic community.

In a Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, held in Rome on 6 December 1740, he informed the cardinals that he had personally governed the see for nine years, but was incarcerated by Irish magistrates in July 1739. As a Roman Catholic prelate, he would have incurred the penalties of high treason had he not been rescued from the hands of his jailers. On making his escape to Dublin a reward of ¬£200 was offered for his apprehension. His cross, rings, books and papers had been taken from him to serve as evidences of his episcopal rank.

The relationship among the genera Coleus, Solenostemon and Plectranthus has been confused. Coleus and Solenostemon were sunk into Plectranthus, but recent phylogenetic analysis found Plectranthus to be paraphyletic with respect to other related genera in the subtribe Plectranthinae. The most recent taxonomic treatment of the genus resurrected Coleus, and 212 names were changed from combinations in Plectranthus, Pycnostachys and Anisochilus. Equilabium was segregated from Plectranthus, after phylogenetic studies supported its recognition as a phylogenetically distinct genus. Coleus are cultivated as ornamental plants, particularly Coleus scutellarioides (syns. Coleus blumei, Plectranthus scutellarioides), which is popular as a garden plant for its brightly colored foliage. This plant prefers bright, but indirect sunlight. If direct sunlight touches the plant's leaves, the colors become less brightly colored. Outside this plant needs total shade or only the most mild morning sunlight. Other species that produce root tubers are cultivated for food, including Coleus esculentus, Coleus rotundifolius and Coleus maculosus subsp. edulis. Taxonomy The genus Coleus was first described by Jo√£o de Loureiro in 1790. Using morphological characters as a guide, it was distinguished from Plectranthus (first described by Charles L'H√©ritier in 1788) by having its four stamens fused together rather than free to the base. In 1962, J.K. Morton noted that fused stamens were more widespread than previously thought, and accordingly merged Coleus into Plectranthus, while maintaining Solenostemon and some other genera as distinct. Most sources followed Morton in submerging Coleus; some kept Solenostemon distinct, although others submerged it into Plectranthus along with Coleus. A preliminary study of the tribe Ocimeae in 2004 showed that the subtribe Plectranthinae was monophyletic, with two main clades: one containing the type species of Coleus and including Solenostemon, the other containing the type species of Plectranthus along with some other genera, so that Plectranthus when broadly defined was not monophyletic. A more detailed study in 2018 reached similar conclusions, and suggested that Coleus (including Solenostemon) should be recognized again, Plectranthus more narrowly defined, and a new genus, Equilabium erected for a clade of former Plectranthus species mainly from tropical Africa. The many new binomial combinations needed to implement this approach were provided in 2019. Phylogeny Paton et al. in 2019 published a summary cladogram for the subtribe Plectranthinae, based on a study in 2018. In the version below, the three genera accepted by Paton et al. that formed part of Plectranthus s.l. are highlighted. Species Paton et al.

It was printed on glossy paper to ensure high quality of micrographs. It is not published any more but all papers are available at no charge and without registration.  History  Food Structure was established in 1982 by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Inc. (Chicago) as Food Microstructure and published biannually. The title was changed to Food Structure in 1990 and the journal was published quarterly. The editor-in-chief was Miloslav Kal√°b (at the time: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada). Reviewers' names (minimum 3 per manuscript) were revealed to the authors, who responded in a Discussion with the Reviewers, published at the end of each paper. The journal was discontinued abruptly at the end of 1993 and the publisher (renamed Scanning Microscopy International) discontinued all operations several years later. Manuscripts already accepted for publication were published in LWT - Food Science and Technology, which had included Kal√°b in their editorial board. Before he died on March 18, 2015, Om Johari declared in writing as the publisher and copyright holder his desire that everything he had published be made freely available. D. J. McMahon has fulfilled his desire by digitizing the journal and placing all papers in PDF format on the Internet. The Tables of Contents facilitate searching.  Contents  A total of 386 papers were published: 279 research papers, 76 reviews, and 31 papers on methods and tutorials. By subject, there were 79 research papers on dairy subjects, 61 on meat research, 53 on cereals, 47 on food lipids and their emulsions, and 32 papers on legumes research. A Cumulative Index for 1982-1989 with 243 entries and an extensive compilation with 882 entries, an Author Index with 876 names, and a Subject Index with 451 entries published a year later facilitated the search for literature on the structure of milk products in the pre-Internet times. The journal is referred to in Infocus. It is listed in library databases such as Ovid. A new, unrelated journal with the same title was established by Elsevier in 2014. In his first Editorial, Editor-in-Chief, D. Rousseau refers to the now defunct journal and declares that, in the new Elsevier journal, the spirit and essence of Food Structure remain the same: to provide a dedicated international venue devoted to innovative food structure and functionality research.

Its fruit are also larger than those of the other British species of Fumaria, at up to . Fumaria occidentalis is an annual plant, flowering from March on the Isles of Scilly, but in May or June on the Cornish mainland. It can be locally abundant in various types of arable and waste land, including field edges and Cornish hedges. Taxonomy Fumaria occidentalis was first described by Herbert William Pugsley in 1904. In 1902, Pugsley had seen herbarium specimens that he could not assign to any British species, and encountered the plant in person in 1904 while in Cornwall \\"for a short holiday\\".

She ran ashore on Fowey Rocks off the coast of Florida on 17 February 1878, was abandoned 3 days later, and broke apart. Today the wreck is a good location for scuba diving. Construction and service SS Arratoon Apcar was built in Renfrew, Scotland by James Henderson and Son. The ship was powered by a 250 hp steam engine, with an iron hull. She was long, wide and had a displacement of 1,480 tons. She was launched on 27 June 1861. She was named after the founder of Apcar and Company of Bombay, India, for whom she was built. In 1872 the Apcar family purchased a considerably larger ship that they also called Arratoon Apcar, selling the older ship to H.F. Swan Company. Wreck SS Arratoon Apcar was en route from Havana, Cuba to Liverpool, England when she ran aground on 17 February 1878 on Fowey Rocks, due to a miscalculation by Captain Pottinger. The reef had already claimed other ships. Several workmen were camped on a platform on the new screw pilings of the Fowey Rocks Light that they were building on the rocks. They were almost hit by the ship, which was stopped by the rocks only away. The crew of the ship spent three days trying to pump her out before abandoning her and heading for the shore in their lifeboats. The captain and his complete crew of 24 men were picked up by the Tappahannock. Foul weather pushed the ship onto the reef, pounding her on the rocks. The ship broke up and was a total loss by 12 March 1878. Mistaken identity The wreck now tentatively identified as the Arratoon Apcar was known for many years as the Arakanapka, and is so called in books and on various dive-related web sites. Today The wreck now lies in of water near the Fowey Rocks. The lower hull and irons beams of the ship are still visible, encrusted with coral, and there are some remains of other parts of the ship. There are many fish, and with shallow water the location provides an excellent site for snorkeling or diving. However, the shallow waters near the reef may create strong surges that could damage a boat. The Arratoon Apcar is one of five historic wrecks in the Biscayne National Park \\"Shipwreck Trail\\".

Formed by theatre director Hannu Raatikainen, theatre actor Esko Varone, and film actor Markku Peltola (best known for his frequent appearances in the films of Aki Kaurism√§ki, including a starring role in the Oscar-nominated Man Without a Past), the band was strongly influenced by performance art and incorporated European theatrical traditions alongside aesthetics influenced by Australian Aboriginal music and Japanese Noh theatre. Following the three original members, Peter Rajanti joined the band in 1987, followed by Jakke Kivel√§ in 1990. In keeping with the theatre/drama background of its founders, Motelli Skronkle's performances were accordingly theatrical. Writer Saku Heinonen summed the band up with the description, \\"Theatre, music, performance, blasphemy,\\" but mused that 20 years on the band had become in Finland \\"a cultural institution [despite being created for the very] purpose [of] resisting cultural institutions and all kinds of structures.\\" The band released three full-length albums on the Finnish label Seal on Velvet, followed by a retrospective anthology in 2000. Though they had been inactive for some time, they began playing together again in the early 2000s, including sets at the 2003 Karma Rock and 2006 Provinssirock festivals, by which time they had earned the mantle of a \\"legendary\\" group among some Finnish music fans.http://www.soundi.fi/jutut/keikat/kaupunkijuhannus-valtteri- festivaali-20-2262013-tullinaukio- tampere-0http://vakiopaine.net/tapahtumat/kaikki/ Following Peltola's death in December 2007, Motelli Skronkle has continued to exist for reunion concerts.

He was however, deposed and killed by the Sasanian nobles before Bahram could confront him. One of the leaders behind the plot against Hormizd was Vistahm and Vinduyih, who made the king's son, Khosrau II, the new king of the Sasanian Empire. However, shortly after the coronation of the new king, Bahram Chobin marched to Ctesiphon and proclaimed himself king under the name of Bahram VI. Khosrau along with Vistahm, and Vinduyih fled to Byzantine territory, where promised emperor Maurice I to cede territory in exchange for military aid. One later year, Khosrau, along with Mushegh II and other nobles, marched towards Ctesiphon, and defeated Bahram, who then fled to Azerbaijan, and wrote a letter to Mushegh, urging him to betray Khosrau. Mushegh, however, rejected the offer.Pourshariati (2008), p. 129 At the head of an army, Mushegh joined the Byzantine army and defeated the army of Bahram Chobin in Battle of Blarathon near Ganzak.

It was the first skyscraper Mies designed and was the first of his buildings to feature concepts such as an exposed skeleton. The cooperative building overlooking Burnham Park has 122 units. History=Seeking an architect In 1946, real estate developer Herbert Greenwald decided to build a new cooperative housing high-rise in Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois. Although the area had several tall apartment buildings, this would be the first such building since the Great Depression. Greenwald discussed options with his neighbor, Charles B. Genther, an architect with Pace Associates. Greenwald sought the notoriety that a big-name architect would bring to the project. He first contacted Frank Lloyd Wright, who offered to design the building for an advance payment of $50,000. Greenwald did not have enough money on hand to pay the architect, so he looked for other options. He contacted Le Corbusier, but the architect replied with a message stating that he would not design buildings in the United States. Eero Saarinen also rejected the commission. Finally, he offered the project to Walter Gropius in Boston, who rejected the commission as it was too far away from his main offices. Gropius suggested that Greenwald instead turn to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who had offices in Chicago. Genther had previously studied under Mies at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He suggested that Mies become involved with the design of the project. Mies was one of the most prominent architects of the time, but had never designed a high-rise structure. The project was named the \\"Promontory Apartments\\" because the proposed site overlooked Promontory Point in Burnham Park. Design Plans for an exposed steel skeleton were rejected for the Promontory Apartments, but later became part of Mies' 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments. After a general floor plan had been suggested, Mies developed a design of the building. He suggested a steel curtain wall that would be encased in brick on two sides. On the other two sides, east and west, he recommended floor-to-ceiling windows between I-beam mullions running the height of the building. Greenwald rejected this design, although he would later approve a similar design for his 860‚Äì880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments. Mies also submitted a second design with an exposed concrete structure on all sides. This design would have low brick spandrel walls and full-length windows on two sides. Greenwald approved this second design. Greenwald struggled to convince banks to lend him money for the project. Greenwald and Mies' concept to develop an apartment scheme with so much glass proved controversial. Finally, in Spring 1947, Greenwald was able to secure a mortgage with the Trust Company of Chicago. The Peter Hamlin Construction Company was selected as the general contractor and construction began that Fall. The project began to attract interest when a model of the final version and a drawing of the steel-and-glass version were put on display for a Mies showcase at the Museum of Modern Art. By the time the building was completed in 1949, all of the apartment units were sold. The Promontory Apartments were the first Mies building to have an exposed skeleton structure, an architectural theme that would dominate the latter portion of his career. Mies first proposed an external skeleton for an office building in 1923, but abandoned the concept until the late 1930s. His Mechanical Engineering Research building on the Illinois Institute of Technology campus featured an exposed concrete frame, but it was infilled with brick spandrel walls and windows and was not constructed in accordance with Mies' design. However, the building design is clearly a precursor to the Promontory Apartments. The Promontory Apartments were an important point in Mies' career. The building was well received in the United States and abroad and further cemented his reputation as a leading architect. The building's success would inspire Greenwald to commission Mies to design more than ten additional apartment projects. Mies was also encouraged by the reception and abandoned the classic elements such as the traditional floor plan for more experimental steel-and-glass design. The building and its display at the Museum of Modern Art encouraged Phyllis and Samuel Bronfman to commission Mies to design the Seagram Building in New York City. In the mid-1960s, the Promontory Apartments Trust contacted Mies about alterations to the ground floor as well as through-wall air conditioners for the spandrel walls. Mies offered his input on these changes, which were put into place c. 1965-66. On November 21, 1996, the building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The Promontory Apartments are adjacent to the 1927 Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, also listed on the National Register. The building is designed as a Double T with the horizontal cross-bars joined; the stems of the T's form wings to the rear. Each T is its own building with separate addresses, elevators, and stairways. This tripartite design would feature prominently in future Mies designs. Starting with the third story, each floor of each T has three apartments which share a small elevator lobby in the center. The first floor has a common lobby and two apartments at a mezzanine level; thus, there are 122 units. The building has a basement with maintenance facilities, storage, laundry, and mechanical equipment rooms.

This was originally a parade of small shops, tea rooms and houses built in 1877 in the Old English style. The site is reached by Marina Road from Victoria Parade. The Marina formed part of the Granville Hotel, Ramsgate complex planned by Edmund Francis Davis. The buildings also included a large hall on the western end Marina Hall - since demolished. The buildings are partly built into the chalk cliffs below the former hotel. Granville Marina, The Graphic, 25 August 1877 The Marina was opened by the Mayor of London (Sir Thomas White) on Thursday 5 July 1877. The architect was J T Wimperis and the contractor was Messrs Paramor and Son, of Margate. In the early 1970s the shops were converted into private flats. Numbers 1-4 were Grade II listed on 21 December 2004. Number 1 Granville Marina, formerly a photographic studio (Frederick T Palmer), was demolished in February 2008. The Granville Marina, photographed by Benedict Kelly, 4 November 2013. The Granville Marina - The Graphic, 24th August, 1877. This magnificent promenade and carriage drive has been constructed for the purpose of affording a more direct means of communication between the Upper East Cliff and the railway station on the sands below. The idea originated with the proprietor, Mr Edmund F Davis, who, with the assistance of Mr J T Wimperis, the architect, has succeeded in giving Ramsgate a novel and most delightful attraction. The main object was, of course, the zig-zag roadway cut out of the cliff, but with this was incorporated a scheme for its embellishment which has been most successfully carried out. The erewhile dreary-looking cliff has been transformed into a charming garden, and along the perpendicular rock excavations have been made an fitted up in quaint Old English style of architecture with shops, restaurants etc, and there are a number of clever- contrived subways and flights of steps, which serve as short cuts from one part of the cliff to another. At the ‚Äúelbow‚Äù of the winding roadway stands the ‚ÄúEstablishment,‚Äù which is to be devoted to musical and other attractive entertainments. This building is in the same style as the shops, and is constructed of red brick with white stone carvings. The entrance has a noble fa√ßade, above which is a large circular window containing the Granville Arms; and windows of stained glass, with allegorical symbols of Music and the sister arts. The hall is fifty feet wide and more than 100 feet in length. It is tastefully decorated in colour and gold, and lighted by an ornamental skylight and side windows of tinted glass, and the recesses around the walls are arranged as an aquarium and winter gardens. Some idea of the enormous difficulties which had to be surmounted, and were actually overcome in the short space of three months, may be gathered from the following facts and figures: 80,000 tons of chalk were removed from the cliff. The materials used in the construction included 2,500,000 bricks, 15,000 cubic feet of timber, 50,000 superficial feet of boarding, 1,000 cubic feet of stone; 1,200 loads of sand, 300 of flints, 200 of gravel, 450 tons of cement, 300 of lime, and 4 of nails, 130,000 tiles, 8,000 feet of glass, 78 tons of ironwork, and more than 7,000 feet of iron piping.

A student of Rudolf Laban, she pursued cross-cultural dance analysis, and generated a new vision of possibilities for human movement and movement training. From her experiences applying Laban‚Äôs concepts of dynamism, three- dimensional movement and mobilization to the rehabilitation of people affected by polio in the 1940s, she went on to develop her own set of movement methods and exercises, known as Bartenieff Fundamentals.From an article by Hackney, P. published in Fitt, S. S. Dance Kinesiology (1996). Hackney, P. Schirmer/Thomson Learning. Bartenieff incorporated Laban's spatial concepts into the mechanical anatomical activity of physical therapy, in order to enhance maximal functioning. In physical therapy, that meant thinking in terms of movement in space, rather than by strengthening muscle groups alone. The introduction of spatial concepts required an awareness of intent on the part of the patient as well, that activated the patient's will and thus connected the patient's independent participation to his or her own recovery. \\"There is no such thing as pure ‚Äúphysical therapy‚Äù or pure ‚Äúmental‚Äù therapy. They are continuously interrelated.\\"Bartenieff, I., Lewis, D. Body movement - Coping with the environment (1980, 2002). New York: Routledge. Bartenieff‚Äôs presentation of herself was quiet and, according to herself, she did not feel comfortable marketing her skills and knowledge. Not until June 1981, a few months before she died, did her name appear in the institute‚Äôs title: Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS), a change initiated by the Board of Directors in her honor.  Biography  Irmgard Bartenieff (born February 24, 1900 in Berlin, Germany, d. August 27, 1981 in New York City) was a dancer, physical therapist, cross-cultural scholar and pioneer in the field of dance/movement therapy. A Renaissance woman who enjoyed weaving disciplines together, she was always ready to investigate movement in a variety of fields‚Äîincluding child development, ethnic dances, nonverbal communication and physical rehabilitation. Irmgard Bartenieff dancing  Laban  In her two- year program with Laban and his colleagues, Bartenieff studied Choreutics (Space Harmony) with Gertrude Loeser, Eukinetics (Effort) with Dussia Bereska, dance technique with Herman Robst and notation and composition with Laban.Groff, E. Laban Movement Analysis: an historical, philosophical, and theoretical perspective (1990). M.F.A. thesis, Connecticut College. Between 1933 and 1936 when political restrictions in Germany limited her work, she made plans to emigrate. She and her second husband, who were Jewish, had a thriving dance company, but their dancers, threatened by the Nazis with expulsion from the union, were forced to resign. During the years when the company was disbanded, Bartenieff worked on modern and historical dance notations, constructing eighteenth-century dances recorded by Raoul Auger Feuillet. The Bartenieffs left Germany the first time for New York on visitor‚Äôs visas leaving her sons in the care of her family. The children left Germany in 1939 on the last peacetime ship before World War II began.Pforsich, J. and Diaz, M. A. Irmgard Bartenieff: personal history (1980). Audiotaped interview, 15 May. Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies Library. Bartenieff brought the work of Laban and his colleagues to North America, where she created a setting for teaching and training the Laban theory. Furthermore she augmented Laban's work with what came to be known as Bartenieff Fundamentals‚Ñ¢.  Polio Patients  Her first appointment in the United States was as Chief Physical Therapist for the Polio Service of New York City at Willard Parker Hospital. She combined her Laban-based understanding of movement with her physical therapy training in the clinical setting. As Bartenieff observed her first polio patients she became intensely aware of their individuality in coping with the sudden loss of function and changes in self-image. \\"The unity of the functional and expressive aspects of movement behavior became increasingly clarified.\\" Both aspects had to be dealt with in the rehabilitation setting. In the treatment process of polio, hot packs and hydrotherapy in Hubbard tanks was replacing bracing and casting. Passive stretching was also used to lengthen muscles that were developing contractures. \\"In stretching the stiff (polio) back, we found that by extending movement possibilities beyond forward flexion of the trunk to include lateral (sideward) flexion and rotation (twisting) we were able to establish full flexibility of the spine in all directions. We therefore moved the trunk passively in a sequence of lateral, rotary, flexion gradually into sitting up.\\" In this way the normal length of the back muscles was restored. Bartenieff described her method in an article in 1955Bartenieff, I. Functional approach to the early treatment of poliomyelitis (1955). Physical Therapy Review 35:12 on this mobilizing technique that she taught in many hospitals. From 1968, at Bellevue Hospital Center Bartenieff‚Äôs work involved cases of the control/restoration of movement patterns governed by the central nervous system rather than the treatment of peripheral problems in the affected muscles of polio patients (polio is a peripheral motor neuron disease). \\"My focus was on the restoration of Shaping (the body‚Äôs ability to adapt its form or shape) possibilities by restoring verticality, and the ability to support body-limb shaping from that verticality. This was in contrast to the more traditional focus on muscular activity without spatial reference.\\"  Handicapped Children  Seven years after her appointment at Willard Parker Hospital, she became chief therapist and coordinator of activity programs (1953‚Äì1957) at Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, New York under the direction of Dr. A.D. Gurewitsch. Blythedale was a small, private, residential treatment center for orthopedically and neurologically handicapped children (ages 5‚Äì14). Her job was to coordinate every aspect of the child‚Äôs long period of hospitalization that involved therapeutic, recreational and educational components. To the physical handicaps of the children were added the emotional impact of ‚Äúthe climate of stasis and regression‚Äù of the hospital itself. The patients were removed from their normal growing experiences: \\"Imagination, initiative, social development was suspended... My task... was to find ways of keeping alive the movement impulse ‚Äî the root of all development of a thinking, feeling, acting human being... and foster the emotional climate. I had to stimulate their natural action potential... innate curiosity, a desire to change, the discovery of alternate ways of functioning, relating to others, taking initiative, resisting, asserting‚Äîall in both physical and emotional modes‚Äîand especially, enjoying play.\\" This work led to developmental studies on newborns and infants at Long Island Jewish Hospital in collaboration with Dr. Judith Kestenberg.Bartenieff, I. and Davis, M. Effort-Shape analysis of movement: the unity of function and expression. Research approaches to movement and personality (1972). New York: Arno Press.  Connective Tissue Massage  Coincident with the Blythedale appointment, Bartenieff also worked at the Institute for the Crippled and Disabled. In this setting she learned connective tissue massage and continued her work with a whole-body focus: \\"We tried to replace wherever possible‚Äîand that means medically feasible‚Äîthe conventional type of localized exercise by total movement patterns based on dance fundamentals.\\"Bartenieff, I. How is the dancing teacher equipped to do dance therapy? (1957). Music Therapy  Back to Study  While maintaining an active practice in physical therapy, Bartenieff resumed study with Laban and his colleagues in England in the 1950s. There she added to her knowledge of Laban‚Äôs Effort theory and the emerging Shape theory of Warren Lamb. Back in New York, she applied these ideas in her own physical therapy practice and set up training programs for dance therapists and other movement professionals.  Dance Therapy  She held a position of dance therapy research assistant (1957‚Äì1967) to Dr. Israel Zwerling at the Day Hospital Unit of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Zwerling, a psychiatrist [...] was very receptive to further exploration of dance as a therapeutic tool for defusing aggression and anxiety. What particularly reinforced his interest in her was that she had a vocabulary and a notation for recording observations of movement. This became a vital factor in daily observations through the one-way screen, especially of family and therapeutic groups. Dance therapy was then an emerging field of adjunctive therapy. Bartenieff‚Äôs special contribution was in bringing Laban‚Äôs work to a field very much in need of movement documentation: [It] provided a method of movement analysis and a system of notation which placed dance therapists on their own professional ground, giving them a language for describing patients‚Äô movements, and eliminating the need to rely on less accurate jargon borrowed from other disciplines.Levy, F. Dance movement therapy: a healing art (1988). Reston, VA: American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance. Laban-based Training Program In her sixty-fifth year Bartenieff established the first North American training program in Laban-based movement theory at the Dance Notation Bureau. It was known as the Effort/Shape Certification program. Students learned a means of observing and describing the qualitative and spatial aspects of movement which Laban and his colleagues in England had been using in various applications since the 1940s. In her own teaching, however, Bartenieff found her students lacking the whole body integration, or ‚Äúconnectedness‚Äù as she called it, necessary to fully experience the range of Effort qualities. Thus, as a remedial measure she began to teach classes in ‚Äúcorrectives‚Äù which eventually came to be known as Bartenieff Fundamentals.  Choreometrics project  Another project of the 1960s was the Choreometrics project, which was a collaboration with Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay. This project took Bartenieff into cross-cultural studies of movement, expressed in work and dance activities.

This project was the first to adapt Laban-based movement analysis to observation of cultural/geographic differences. It is only one example of Bartenieff‚Äôs acute awareness of the differences among peoples of the world. In 1977‚Äì1978 she conducted a study of cross-cultural methods of movement fundamentals, presenting her findings in a major conference paper.Bartenieff, I. and Lamb, T. Principles for studying the basis of movement in diverse cultures. (1978). Unpublished paper. CORD/ADG conference, Honolulu, HI, July. Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies Library. It was the first demonstration of Fundamentals to Bartenieff‚Äôs peers in dance research. These projects contributed significantly to the theoretical development of Effort/Shape and Fundamentals. Irmgard Bartenieff  Laban Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS)  The Effort/Shape program outgrew its home at the Dance Notation Bureau, where the last year-long certificate program ran in 1977‚Äì1978. It was re-formed and relocated as the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS). The founding board of directors created LIMS specifically as a place where Bartenieff, then in her seventy-eighth year, could continue her research, writing and teaching. In 1980 her book Body movement: coping with the environment, written with Dori Lewis, was published as a study of human movement from a whole-person perspective and a rich account of Bartenieff‚Äôs own experiences in movement work. ‚ÄúUp to the last six months of her life, when she became ill, Bartenieff maintained a private physical therapy practice and lectured and taught around the country.\\"Moore, C-L.

Bartenieff Fundamentals  Bartenieff Fundamentals is not a system of set exercises. It is an approach to basic body training that deals with principles of anatomical body function within a context that encourages personal expression and full psychophysical functioning as an integral part of total body mobilization. Irmgard Bartenieff said, ‚ÄúBody movement is not a symbol for expression, it is the expression. Anatomical and spatial relationships create sequences of Effort rhythms with emotional concomitants. The functional and the expressive are one in the human being.‚ÄùBartenieff, I. Body/Space/Effort: The Art of Body Movement as a Key Perception (1979). Unpublished Manuscript. Bartenieff Fundamentals utilizes the entire Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) framework to develop movement efficiency and expressiveness. It emphasizes mobility process rather than muscle strength to achieve maximally efficient and expressive movement.

Facts  Since the 1999 judgment of the Constitution Court in SANDU v Minister of Defence, the legislative framework constructed for collective bargaining in South Africa had taken force.  High Court  The application originated in five separate matters initiated by SANDU against the Minister of Defence in the Pretoria High Court between 2001 and 2003, which resulted in three separate High Court judgments: # The first of these judgments (SANDU I), held that the SANDF was not obliged to bargain collectively with SANDU, and that SANDF‚Äôs withdrawal from negotiations with SANDU was reasonable. # The second of these judgments (SANDU II), also concerned the duty to bargain, as well as an attack on specific regulations passed pursuant to national legislation, relating to labour relations in the military. This judgment held that the regulations violated the union members‚Äô rights to participate in union activities, as well as their rights to freedom of expression and association; it held that, contrary to the earlier judgment, the SANDF had a duty to bargain with SANDU. # In the third case (SANDU III), the court made an order preventing the SANDF from implementing a restructuring programme without first consulting with SANDU.  Supreme Court of Appeal  The decisions in these three cases were appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. A single, consolidated hearing was held, resulting in two unanimous judgments: # The first judgment held that the SANDF is not obliged by the provisions of the Constitution or any other law to bargain collectively with SANDU. # The second judgment dismissed all the challenges to the regulations, save one. SANDU sought leave to appeal to the Constitutional Court against the large part of the judgments and orders made by the Supreme Court of Appeal.  Judgment  O‚ÄôRegan J, writing for the Court, dealt with the history of the relationship between SANDU and the SANDF. She confirmed the principle of subsidiarity, holding that, where legislation has been enacted to give effect to a constitutional right, a litigant is not entitled to bypass that legislation and to rely directly on the constitutional right. If, in other words, a framework has been created to give effect to the Constitution, a litigant must use that framework, unless he means to claim that it falls short or is unconstitutional; otherwise the legislative intervention would serve no purpose. As regulations had been enacted to give effect to section 23 of the Constitution, and to regulate the bargaining relationship between SANDU and the SANDF, the application for leave to appeal must be determined in the light of those regulations. The court did not find it necessary, accordingly, to determine whether section 23(5) of the Constitution confers a justiciable duty to bargain collectively on employers and trade unions. The judgment concluded that the regulations establish a bargaining forum, the Military Bargaining Council (the MBC), where matters of mutual interest to SANDU and the SANDF are to be negotiated. If disputes arise in respect of such matters, those disputes may be referred to arbitration by the Military Arbitration Board. The court held that, on a proper construction of the regulations, the SANDF may not impose pre-conditions for bargaining; nor may it withdraw unilaterally from the MBC. It also found that the regulations do not permit the SANDF to implement unilaterally a transformation policy which is the subject of a dispute at the MBC, and which has been referred to the Military Arbitration Board. Finally, the court held that SANDU is not entitled in terms of the regulations to demand that the respondents bargain over the content of the regulations: > Were s 23(5) to establish a justiciable duty to bargain, enforceable by > either employers or unions outside of a legislative framework to regulate > that duty, courts may be drawn into a range of controversial industrial > relations issues. > These issues would include questions such as at which level bargaining > should take place, level of union membership required to give rise to the > duty, topics and manner of bargaining. These are difficult issues which the courts are not the best equipped to deal with. In considering the challenges to the individual regulations, the court dismissed SANDU‚Äôs challenge to the regulation that prohibits union members from participating in union activities while undergoing training or participating in military exercises. The SANDF can justifiably limit union activities in instances when such activities may interfere with the military‚Äôs ability to carry out its constitutional obligation to protect the country. In the same vein, the SANDF has a legitimate interest in preserving the appearance of the political neutrality of the military by prohibiting association with other trade unions. The court held, however, that several of the regulations were unconstitutional. It found that the Minister of Defence, as head of SANDF, could not appoint the members of the Military Arbitration Board (the body tasked with settling union disputes) because appointment by an interested party (the Minister as the employer) undermines the impartiality and independence of the Board. Furthermore, regulations which prohibited union members from being represented by union members or officials in grievance or disciplinary proceedings offended the right to fair labour practices, because representing its members is one of a union‚Äôs central tasks. Finally, to the extent that the good order and discipline of the military was not jeopardised, the SANDF could not forbid non-uniformed soldiers from assembling to petition or picket as private citizens.

The growth of cellular telephone in the 1980s attracted interest in commercial applications. The upgrade to digital radio technology in the mobile phone, indoor wireless network, and satellite broadcasting industries created new opportunities for smart antennas in the 1990s, culminating in the development of the MIMO (multiple-input multiple- output) technology used in 4G wireless networks.  Directional antennas  The earliest success at tracking and controlling wireless signals relied on the antennas‚Äô physical configuration and motion. The German inventor and physicist Karl F. Braun demonstrated beamforming for the first time in 1905. Braun created a phased array by positioning three antennas to reinforce radiation in one direction and diminish radiation in other directions. Guglielmo Marconi experimented with directional antennas in 1906. Directional antennas were rotated to detect and track enemy forces during World War I. The British admiralty used goniometers (radio compasses) to track the German fleet. Edwin H. Armstrong invented the superheterodyne receiver to detect the high frequency noise generated by German warplanes‚Äô ignition systems. The war ended before Armstrong's creation was ready to help direct antiaircraft fire. Multiple elements (a fed dipole, a director, and reflectors) were assembled in the 1920s to create narrow transmit and receive antenna patterns. The Yagi-Uda array, better known as the Yagi antenna, is still widely used. Edmond Bruce and Harald T. Friis developed directional antennas for shortwave and microwave frequencies during the 1930s. AT&T;'s decision to use microwave to carry inter-city telephone traffic led to the first large-scale commercial deployment of directional antennas (based on Friis‚Äô horn reflector design) in 1947. Directional antennas with alternating polarization enabled a single pair of frequencies to be reused over many consecutive hops. Microwave links are less expensive to deploy and maintain than coaxial cable links.  Phased array radar  The first mechanically scanned phased array radar (using a rotating Yagi antenna) was demonstrated in the 1930s. The first electronically scanned radars used electromechanical devices (such as mechanical tuners or switches) to steer the antenna's beam. Germany built the Wullenweber circular array for direction finding during the early years of World War II. The Wullenweber could electronically scan the horizon 360¬∞ and determine the direction of any signal with reasonably good accuracy. Circular arrays were enhanced during the Cold War for eavesdropping purposes. The American Physicist Luis Walter Alvarez developed the first ground-controlled approach (GCA) system for landing aircraft in bad weather based on an electronically steered microwave phased array antenna. Alvarez tested and deployed the system in England in 1943. Near the end of the war, Germany's GEMA built an early warning phased array radar system (the PESA Mammut 1) to detect targets up to 300 km away. The polyrod fire control antenna was developed by Bell Laboratories in 1947 using cascaded phase shifters controlled by a rotary switch (spinning at ten revolutions per second) to create a continuous scanning beam. A major push to meet national security response time and coverage requirements called for the development of an all-electronic steerable planar phased array radar. The USSR's launch of Sputnik in 1957 suggested the need for ground-based satellite surveillance systems. Bendix Corporation responded by building its Electronically Steerable Array Radar (ESAR) in 1960. Enhanced beamforming techniques, such as multiple-beam Butler matrices, were developed for detecting and tracking objects in space. The launch of Explorer 1 by the United States in 1958 suggested another application: space-based radar systems for detecting and tracking aircraft, ships, armored vehicles, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles. These systems required the development of special techniques for canceling the radar clutter seen from space, nulling ground-based jammers, and compensating for Doppler shifts experienced by fast-moving satellites. Space-based radar systems spurred the development of smaller, lighter weight, and less costly components: monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) for operation at frequencies in the 1 GHz to 30 GHz (microwave) and 30 GHz to 300 GHz (millimeter wave) ranges. The high power levels needed for detection are easier to achieve at microwave frequencies. The narrow beams required for high resolution target tracking are best achieved at millimeter wave frequencies. Companies such as Texas Instruments, Raytheon, RCA, Westinghouse, General Electric, and Hughes Electronics participated in the early development of MMICs. The first all-solid state radar was built for the United States Marines in 1972 by General Electric. It was a mobile 3-D radar system with its array mounted on a rotating platform for scanning the horizon. The first all-solid state phased array radar was the PAVE PAWS (precision acquisition vehicle entry - phased array warning system) UHF radar built in 1978 for the United States Air Force. Phased array antennas are also used in radio astronomy. Karl Jansky, discoverer of the radio waves emanating from the Milky Way galaxy, used a Bruce array for experiments he conducted in 1931. Modern phased array radio telescopes typically consist of a number of small, interconnected antennas such as the Murchison Widefield Array in Australia, constructed in 2012.  Adaptive antenna arrays  L. C. van Atta was first to describe a retrodirective antenna, which redirects (rather than reflects) a signal back in the direction from which it came, in his 1959 patent. The signal can be modulated by the redirecting host for purposes such as radio-frequency identification and traffic control (radar target echo enhancement). The first adaptive array, the side-lobe canceller, was developed by Paul Howells and Sid Applebaum at General Electric in 1959 to suppress radar jamming signals. Building on Norbert Wiener‚Äôs work with analog filters, in 1960 Stanford University professor Bernard Widrow and PhD student Ted Hoff developed the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm that automatically adjusts an antenna's directivity pattern to reinforce desired signals. Ted Compton at Ohio State University developed an adaptive antenna technique for recovering direct sequence spread spectrum signals in the presence of narrowband co-channel interference. Compton's method, reported in 1974, only requires knowledge of the desired signal's pseudorandom noise (PN) code‚Äînot its direction of arrival. In the late 1970s, Kesh Bakhru and Don Torrieri developed the maximin algorithm for recovering frequency hopping signals in the presence of narrowband co-channel interference. A 1977 paper by Bell Labs researchers Douglas O. Reudink and Yu S. Yeh described the advantages of scanning spot beams for satellites. The authors estimated that scanning spot beams could save 20 dB in link budget which in turn could be used to reduce transmit power, increase communication capacity, and decrease the size of earth-station antennas. Satellite spot beams are used today by direct broadcast satellite systems such as DirecTV and Dish Network. The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), proposed in 1983, became a major source of funding for technology research in several areas. The algorithms developed to track intercontinental ballistic missiles and direct x-ray laser weapons were particularly relevant to smart antennas.  Digital antenna arrays  These are antenna arrays with multi channels digital beamforming, usually by using FFT. The theory of the 'digital antenna arrays' (DAA) started to emerge as a theory of multichannel estimation. Its origins go back into methods developed in the 1920s that were used to determine direction of the arrival of radio signals by a set of two antennas based on the phase difference or amplitudes of their output voltages. Thus, the assessment of the directions of arrival of a single signal was conducted according to pointedtype indicator readings or according to the Lissajous curves, drawn by beam on the oscilloscope screen.Slyusar V. I. Origins of the Digital Antenna Array Theory.// International Conference on Antenna Theory and Techniques, 24‚Äì27 May 2017, Kyiv, Ukraine. ‚Äì Pp. 199 - 201 In the late 1940s this approach caused the emergence of the theory of three- channel antenna analyzers that provided the solution to the problem of signal separation of air target and ‚Äúantipode‚Äù reflected from the underlying surface by solving system of equations which were obtained with the help of complex voltages of three-channel signal mix. The growing complexity of solving such radar challenges, as well as the need to implement effective signal processing by the end of the 1950s predetermined the use of electronic computers in this field. For example, in 1957, Ben S. Meltont and Leslie F. Bailey published a very significant article in this field,Ben S. Meltont and Leslie F. Bailey, Multiple Signal Correlators.//Geophysics .- July, 1957. - Vol. XXII, No. 3. - Pp. 565-588. - DOI: 10.1190/1.1438390 where authors offered options of implementation of algebraic operations for signal processing with the help of electronic circuits, their equivalents, with the aim to develop signal correlator on the base of certain analogue computer. The replacement of analogue computer facilities by digital technologies three years after in 1960 was embodied in the idea of using high-speed computers to solve directional finding problems, initially to locate earthquake epicenter. B. A. Bolt was one of the first who implemented this idea in practice,B. A. Bolt. The Revision of Earthquake Epicentres, Focal Depths and Origin-Times using a High-speed Computer.//Geophysical Journal. - 1960, Vol. 3, Issue 4. - Pp. 433 ‚Äî 440. - DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-246X.1960.tb01716.x. he has developed a program for IBM 704 for seismic direction finding based on the method of least squares. Almost simultaneously a similar approach was used by Flinn, research fellow of the Australian National University.E. A. Flinn. Local earthquake location with an electronic computer.//Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. - July 1960. - Vol. 50, No. 3. ‚Äì Pp. 467 - 470 Despite the fact that in the mentioned experiments the interface between sensors and computer was implemented with the help of data input cards, such decision was a decisive step on the way of the appearance of the DAA. Then, there was only to solve the problem of direct digital data, obtained from sensing elements, input into computer, excluding the stage of preparation of punch card and operator assistance as a surplus link. Apparently, it was Polikarpov B.I. who first drew attention to the potential possibilities of multichannel analyzers in the former USSRPolikarpov B.I. On some possibilities of application of independent channels of signal reception and the use of electronics and computer technologies to improve antijamming capabilities and resolution characteristic of radar measurement//Express Information, BNT, ‚Ññ 23, 1961. Polikarpov B.I. shows the principal possibility of signal sources resolution with an angular distance less than aperture angle of the antenna system. However, a specific solution to the problem of superRayleigh resolution of the emission sources was proposed by Varyukhin V.A. and Zablotskiy M.A. only in 1962, they invented corresponding method of measuring of directions to sources of electromagnetic field.A.S. USSR ‚Ññ 25752. Method of measuring of directions to sources of electromagnetic field. // Varyukhin V.A., Zablotskiy M.A. ‚Äì 1962 This method was based on the processing of information contained in the distribution of complex voltage amplitudes at the outputs of amplitude, phase and phase- amplitude multichannel analyzers and it permitted to determine the angular coordinates of sources within the width of the main lobe of the receiving antenna system. Further Varyukhin V.A. developed a general theory of multichannel analyzers, based on the processing of information contained in the distribution of complex voltage amplitudes at the outputs of the digital antenna array. An important milestone in the recognition of the scientific results of Varyukhin V.A. was the defence of his doctor of science dissertation, held in 1967. A distinctive feature of developed by him theoretical foundations is the maximum automation of the process of assessment of the coordinates and parameters of signals, whereas an approach based on the generation of the response function of seismic multichannel analyzer and assessment of its resolution capabilities on the basis of visual impressions was just arisen at that time. What is meant here is a Capon methodJ. Capon, ‚ÄúHigh‚ÄìResolution Frequency‚ÄìWavenumber Spectrum Analysis,‚Äù Proceedings of the IEEE, 1969, Vol. 57, pp. 1408‚Äì1418 and developed further multiple signal classification (MUSIC), Estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) methods and other projection methods of spectral estimation. Of course, it is ungrateful to make a conclusion about the priority and importance of various alternative scientific approaches in the process of development of a general theory of the DAA, taking into account classified nature of the majority works and the lack of the possibility to study scientific heritage of that time, even taking into account Internet. Proposed here historical journey only slightly raised the veil of time over the true development of scientific research and its main aim was to point general niche and time frame of the inception of the theory of multichannel analysis through the lens of historical background. A detailed presentation of the historical stages of development of the DAA theory deserves standalone consideration.  Advanced processing techniques  A 1979 paper by Ralph O. Schmidt of Electromagnetic Systems Laboratory (ESL, a supplier of strategic reconnaissance systems) described the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for estimating signals‚Äô angle of arrival. Schmidt used a signal subspace method based on geometric modeling to derive a solution assuming the absence of noise and then extended the method to provide a good approximation in the presence of noise. Schmidt's paper became the most cited and his signal subspace method became the focus of ongoing research. Jack Winters showed in 1984 that received signals from multiple antennas can be combined (using the optimum combining technique) to reduce co-channel interference in digital mobile networks. Up to this time, antenna diversity had only been used to mitigate multipath fading. However, digital mobile networks would not become common for another ten years. Richard Roy developed the Estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm in 1987. ESPRIT is a more efficient and higher resolution algorithm than MUSIC for estimating signals‚Äô angle of arrival. Brian Agee and John Treichler developed the constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for blind equalization of analog FM and telephone signals in 1983. CMA relies on knowledge of the signal's waveform rather than channel state information or training signals. Agee extended the CMA to adaptive antenna arrays over the next few years. During the 1990s companies such as Applied Signal Technology (AST) developed airborne systems to intercept digital cellular phone calls and text messages for law enforcement and national security purposes. While an airborne system can eavesdrop on a mobile user anywhere in a cellular network, it will receive all mobile stations reusing the same user and control frequencies at roughly the same power level. Adaptive antenna beamforming and interference cancellation techniques are used to focus on the target user. AST was acquired by Raytheon in 2011.  Space division multiple access (SDMA)  In 1947 Douglas H. Ring wrote a Bell Laboratories internal memorandum describing a new way to increase the capacity of metropolitan radio networks. Ring proposed dividing a city into geographic cells, using low power transmitters with omnidirectional antennas, and reusing frequencies in non-adjacent cells. Ring's cellular radio scheme did not become practical until the arrival of integrated circuits in the 1970s. As the number of mobile phone subscribers grew in the 1980s and 1990s researchers investigated new ways to increase mobile phone network capacity. Directional antennas were used to divide cells into sectors. In 1989, Simon Swales at Bristol University in the United Kingdom proposed methods for increasing the number of simultaneous users on the same frequency. Receive signals can be distinguished based on differences in their direction- of-arrival at the cell site antenna array. Transmit signals can be aimed at the intended recipient using beamforming. Soren Anderson in Sweden presented a similar scheme based on computer simulations the following year. Richard Roy and Bj√∂rn Ottersten at Arraycomm patented a spatial division multiple access method for wireless communication systems in the early 1990s. This technology was employed in Arraycomm's IntelliCell product line.  First commercial smart antennas  Richard Roy and French entrepreneur Arnaud Saffari founded ArrayComm in 1992 and recruited Marty Cooper, who led the Motorola group that developed the first portable cell phone, to head the company. ArrayComm's smart antennas were designed to increase the capacity of wireless networks employing time division duplex (TDD) such as the PHS (Personal Handy-phone System) networks that were deployed throughout Asia. Bell Labs researcher Douglas O. Reudink founded Metawave Communications, a maker of switched beam antennas for cellular telephone networks, in 1995. Metawave claimed that by focusing capacity on areas with the highest traffic it could boost cell capacity up to 75%. Though Metawave managed to sell switched beam antennas to at least one major carrier, the company went out of business in 2004. In 1997, AT&T; Wireless Group announced plans to offer fixed wireless service at speeds up to 512 kbit/s. Project Angel promised non-line of sight (NLOS) coverage using beamforming and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Service was launched in ten cities in 2000. However, by 2002 AT&T; sold its fixed wireless service business to Netro Corp.  Development of 4G MIMO  Smart antenna research led to the development of 4G MIMO. Conventional smart antenna techniques (such as diversity and beamforming) deliver incremental gains in spectral efficiency. 4G MIMO exploits natural multipath propagation to multiply spectral efficiency. Researchers studying the transmission of multiple signals over different wires in the same cable bundle helped create a theoretical foundation for 4G MIMO. Specifically, techniques for cancelling the effects of crosstalk using knowledge of the source signals were investigated. The ‚Äúwireline MIMO‚Äù researchers included Lane H. Brandenburg and Aaron D. Wyner (1974), Wim van Etten (1970s), Jack Salz (1985), and Alexandra Duel-Hallen (1992). Though optimizing the transmission of multiple data streams over different wire pairs in the same bundle requires compensating for crosstalk, the transmission of multiple data streams over different wireless paths due to multipath propagation is a far greater challenge because the signals become mixed up in time, space, and frequency. Greg Raleigh‚Äôs 1996 paper was first to propose a method for multiplying the capacity of point-to- point wireless links using multiple co-located antennas at each end of a link in the presence of multipath propagation. The paper provided a rigorous mathematical proof of MIMO capacity based on a precise channel model and identified OFDM as the most efficient air interface for use with MIMO. The paper was submitted to the IEEE in April 1996 and presented in November at the 1996 Global Communications Conference in London. Raleigh also filed two patent applications for MIMO in August of the same year. Raleigh discovered that multipath propagation could be exploited to multiply link capacity after developing an improved channel model that showed how multipath propagation affects signal waveforms. The model took into account factors including radio propagation geometry (natural and man-made objects serving as ‚Äúlocal reflectors‚Äù and ‚Äúdominant reflectors‚Äù), antenna array steering, angle of arrival, and delay spread. Bell Labs researcher Gerard J. Foschini‚Äôs paper submitted in September 1996 and published in October of the same year also theorized that MIMO could be used to significantly increase the capacity of point-to-point wireless links. Bell Labs demonstrated a prototype MIMO system based on its BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) technology in late 1998. Space-time block code (also known as the Alamouti code) was developed by Siavash Alamouti and is widely used in MIMO-OFDM systems. Alamouti's 1998 paper showed that the benefits of receive diversity can also be achieved using a combination of transmit diversity and space-time block codes. A key advantage of transmit diversity is that it does not require multiple antennas and RF chains in handsets.  Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)  OFDM emerged in the 1950s when engineers at Collins Radio Company found that a series of non-contiguous sub-channels are less vulnerable to inter-symbol interference (ISI). OFDM was studied more systematically by Robert W. Chang in 1966. Chang used Fourier transforms to ensure orthogonality. Sidney Darlington proposed use of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in 1970. Stephen B. Weinstein and Paul M. Ebert used a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to perform baseband modulation and demodulation in 1971. Dial-up modems developed by Gandalf Technologies and Telebit in the 1970s and 1980s used OFDM to achieve higher speeds. Amati Communications Corp. used its discrete multi-tone (DMT) form of OFDM to transmit data at higher speeds over phone lines also carrying phone calls in digital subscriber line (DSL) applications. OFDM is part of the digital audio broadcasting (DAB) and digital video broadcasting (DVB) standards developed in Europe. OFDM is also used in the 802.11a and 802.11g wireless LAN standards.  Commercialization of 4G MIMO  Greg Raleigh, V. K. Jones, and Michael Pollack founded Clarity Wireless in 1996. The company built a prototype MIMO- OFDM fixed wireless link running 100 Mbit/s in 20 MHz of spectrum in the 5.8 GHz band, and demonstrated error-free operation over six miles with one watt of transmit power. Cisco Systems acquired Clarity Wireless in 1998 for its non-line of sight, vector OFDM (VOFDM) technology. The Broadband Wireless Industry Forum (BWIF) was created in 1999 to develop a VOFDM standard. Arogyaswami Paulraj founded Iospan Wireless in late 1998 to develop MIMO-OFDM products. Iospan was acquired by Intel in 2003. Neither Clarity Wireless nor Iospan Wireless shipped MIMO-OFDM products before being acquired. Greg Raleigh and V. K. Jones founded Airgo Networks in 2001 to develop MIMO-OFDM chipsets for wireless LANs. In 2004, Airgo became the first company to ship MIMO-OFDM products. Qualcomm acquired Airgo Networks in late 2006. Surendra Babu Mandava and Arogyaswami Paulraj founded Beceem Communications in 2004 to produce MIMO- OFDM chipsets for WiMAX. The company was acquired by Broadcom in 2010. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) created a task group in late 2003 to develop a wireless LAN standard delivering at least 100 Mbit/s of user data throughput. There were two major competing proposals: TGn Sync was backed by companies including Intel and Philips, and WWiSE was supported by companies including Airgo Networks, Broadcom, and Texas Instruments. Both groups agreed that the 802.11n standard would be based on MIMO-OFDM with 20 MHz and 40 MHz channel options. TGn Sync, WWiSE, and a third proposal (MITMOT, backed by Motorola and Mitsubishi) were merged to create what was called the Joint Proposal. The final 802.11n standard supported speeds up to 600 Mbit/s (using four simultaneous data streams) and was published in late 2009. WiMAX was developed as an alternative to cellular standards, is based on the 802.16e standard, and uses MIMO-OFDM to deliver speeds up to 138 Mbit/s. The more advanced 802.16m standard enabled download speeds up to 1 Gbit/s. A nationwide WiMAX network was built in the United States by Clearwire, a subsidiary of Sprint-Nextel, covering 130 million pops by mid-2012. Clearwire subsequently announced plans to deploy LTE (the cellular 4G standard) covering 31 cities by mid-2013. The first 4G cellular standard was proposed by NTT DoCoMo in 2004. Long term evolution (LTE) is based on MIMO-OFDM and continues to be developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). LTE specifies downlink rates up to 300 Mbit/s, uplink rates up to 75 Mbit/s, and quality of service parameters such as low latency. LTE Advanced adds support for picocells, femtocells, and multi-carrier channels up to 100 MHz wide. LTE has been embraced by both GSM/UMTS and CDMA operators. The first LTE services were launched in Oslo and Stockholm by TeliaSonera in 2009. Deployment is most advanced in the United States, where all four Tier 1 operators have or are constructing nationwide LTE networks. There are currently more than 222 LTE networks in 83 countries operational with approximately 126 million connections (devices).  Emerging 5G MIMO-OFDM standards  The 802.11ac wireless LAN standard was proposed to deliver speeds of 1 Gbit/s and faster. Development of the specification began in 2011 and is expected to be completed by 2014. 802.11ac uses the 5 GHz band, defines channels up to 160 MHz wide, supports up to 8 simultaneous MIMO data streams, and delivers raw data rates up to nearly 7 Gbit/s. A number of products based on 802.11ac draft specifications are now available. Fifth generation (5G) mobile network concepts are in the exploratory stage. Commercialization is expected by the early 2020s. In March 2013, NTT DoCoMo tested a10 Gbit/s uplink using 400 MHz in the 11 GHz band. In May 2013, Samsung announced that it is experimenting in the 28 GHz band using base stations with up to 64 antennas and has achieved 1 Gbit/s at distances up to 2 kilometers. Samsung claims the technology could deliver tens of Gbit/s under favorable conditions. Research papers suggest that 5G networks are likely to consist of small distributed cells operating at frequencies up to 90 GHz using ‚Äúmassive MIMO.‚Äù According to Jakob Hoydis of Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Germany, ‚ÄúNetwork densification is the only solution to the capacity crunch.‚Äù This could involve two-tier networks (‚ÄúHetNets‚Äù) using existing cellular base stations to ensure broad coverage and high mobility and interspersed small cells for capacity and indoor service. Massive MIMO would also be employed in high-speed backhaul links.

High Court  Justice Hartzenburg, in the Transvaal High Court, declared that a provision of the Defence ActAct 44 of 1957. prohibiting members of the Defence Force from becoming members of a trade union, and from engaging in any ‚Äúprotest action‚Äù as defined in the Act, was unconstitutional. To have any force and effect, however, the declaration of invalidity had to be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.  Constitutional Court  The Minister of Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force (the respondents in this matter), opposed confirmation of the order of invalidity only in respect of the prohibition on joining trade unions. The South African Defence Force Union (the applicant) accepted that strike action was inappropriate in the military context, but argued that this should not prevent members of the Defence Force from joining a trade union.  Judgment  O'Regan J  Public protest  In a majority judgement, delivered by Justice O'Regan, the Constitutional Court decided that prohibiting participation in acts of public protest violated the right to freedom of expression of Defence Force members. This curtailed the right of Defence Force members to receive and express opinions on a wide range of issues, whether in public or private gatherings, and amounted to a grave infringement on the fundamental rights of soldiers. The court determined that this infringement constituted an unjustifiable limitation upon the right to freedom of expression, and was consequently unconstitutional. The court indicated, however, that a different legislative provision, narrower in its scope, may be constitutionally justified. This question, though, was obviously not before the court.  Trade union membership  The applicant argued that prohibiting membership of a trade union infringed the constitutional right of ‚Äúevery worker‚Äù ‚Äúto form and join a trade union.‚Äù Turning to international law, as mandated by the Constitution, O‚ÄôRegan considered the Convention on Freedom of Association, which specifically provides that soldiers and spies may join trade unions, but does not prescribe the facets of trade-union life to which soldiers and spies are entitled. These questions are left to the country in question to regulate and determine itself. Referring to the International Labour Organization‚Äôs construction of ‚Äúworker‚Äù, Justice O‚ÄôRegan interpreted the term ‚Äúevery worker‚Äù to include members of the armed forces, even though their relationship with the Defence Force is unusual and not identical to that of an ordinary employment relationship. One ‚Äúenrols‚Äù in the permanent force; there is no job interview, etc., as a result of or requirement for enrolment. Furthermore, certain unusual rights and obligations are incurred. The court decided that this is a case in which a generous interpretation of the right is appropriate. Although members of the Defence Force may not be employees in the full contractual sense of the word, their conditions of enrolment in many respects mirror those of people employed under an ordinary contract of employment. In other words, they are not \\"employees\\" in the fullest sense, but there are some similarities between their position and that of employment. The court stated that, in appropriate circumstances, the constitutional right to join a trade union may be limited, provided that such a limitation is constitutionally justifiable. The question, therefore, was this: Does the legislation's blanket ban on trade-union activity for such workers limit the right enshrined in section 36 of the Constitution? If so, is that limit justifiable? The respondents contended that any infringement of the right was justified by the constitutional imperative to structure and manage the Defence Force as a ‚Äúdisciplined military force.‚Äù They maintained that a Defence Force could not be such a ‚Äúdisciplined military force‚Äù if its members belonged to trade unions and wished to exercise their rights to collective bargaining and strike action. The applicant argued that a trade union could function and further the interests of its members without participating in strike action. The court decided that the requirement of strict discipline would not necessarily be undermined by permitting Defence Force members to join a trade union, as the structure and scope of such a union might differ, given the military environment. A blanket prohibition on trade-union activity was therefore unjustifiable. The court decided that the order of invalidity in respect of trade-union membership would only come into force three months from the date of judgement. The court added as a proviso that, if the delayed order would cause either party substantial prejudice, such party might approach the Constitutional Court for a variation of the order. = Sachs J = In a separate and concurring judgement, Justice Albie Sachs made two qualifications to the judgement of Justice O‚ÄôRegan.  Public protest  First, reinforcing the centrality of freedom of expression in South Africa's constitutional democracy, Sachs added that a blindly obedient soldier represented a greater threat to the constitutional order than a constitutionally conscientious one who regarded him- or herself as a citizen in uniform.  Freedom of association  Secondly, since the Constitution guarantees freedom of association and fair labour practices, soldiers are entitled to form a body such as SANDU to look after their employment interests. Therefore, it was unnecessary to decide whether soldiers qualified as \\"workers.\\" To do so might give them a promise of full workers and trade union rights that turned out to be empty, and also suggest that hard-won workers‚Äô rights could easily be limited.

The charity of Joannes shone especially during the eight years the plague knocked about the Brussels region. He often stood for hours at the city walls on the side of Schaerbeek. He there found people who were infected with the disease and who wanted to cleanse their souls of sins, from whom he took their confessions. Then he comforted them and sent them -strengthened by alms- to the common hospital. Artist's impression (2015) by Ronald H. Recourt. During 1667-1676, Joannes was the parish priest of the collegiate church of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula in Brussels and as such responsible for the pastoral tasks of his parish.Prof. Reusens en Victor Barbier (1898). Analectes pour servir a L'Histoire Eccl√©siastique de la Belgique. Deuxi√®me s√©rie, Tome 11. Premi√®re Livraison. Leuven, pages 92-93. According to Henne & Wauters he was known as the \\"father of the poor\\" and he lived himself in great austerity.Alexandre Henne en Alphonse G.F. Wauters (1845). Histoire de la Ville de Bruxelles. Tome 3. Brussel, page 242. When receiving goods from wealthy people, he sold these and divided the proceeds among the 'souffrants de Jesus-Christ'. Joannes also donated his wages of several thousand florins, which he earned by teaching at the Old University of Leuven, to the poor people of Brussels. According to his death announcement, he also took care of the sick people, prisoners and soldiers.Jean Fran√ßois Foppens (1739).Bibliotheca Belgica Volume 2, Bruxellis, pages 719-720. Due to his large generosity, his friends had to regularly support him with necessities of life. Theologian Through a number of publications, Joannes Roucourt left his mark in the history of Christian theology, including in the area of penance. His works are based on a strong pastoral thought and free from doctrines, says Lucien Ceyssens.Lucien Ceyssens In: Dictionnaire de Spiritualit√©, Tome 13, Colonne 1006: Roucourt (Racourt, Raucourt, Rocourt; Jean), pr√™tre, 1636-1676 website. He preached that confessors of penance should also actively practice the Christian virtues and that they worked to prevent their flaws, such as blasphemy and cursing. The Italian Cardinal Giovanni Bona complimented Roucourt in 1674 with his books and wrote to him: I appreciate your method of questions and answers, which is very suitable to instruct believers and to convince heretics. Where others fail by writing (too) thick books, you are able to capture the essence in short phrases.Lucien Ceyssens (1968), La seconde p√©riode du Jansenisme, Tome 1 Sources des ann√©es 1673-1676, Bruxelles, page 206. citaat: \\"Laudo autem methodem qua uteris per interrogationes et responsiones; aptior est enim ad instruendos fideles et ad haereticos convincedos.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1989 Strategy Bayesian optimization of a function (black) with Gaussian processes (purple). Three acquisition functions (blue) are shown at the bottom. Since the objective function is unknown, the Bayesian strategy is to treat it as a random function and place a prior over it. The prior captures beliefs about the behavior of the function. After gathering the function evaluations, which are treated as data, the prior is updated to form the posterior distribution over the objective function. The posterior distribution, in turn, is used to construct an acquisition function (often also referred to as infill sampling criteria) that determines the next query point. There are several methods used to define the prior/posterior distribution over the objective function. The most common two methods use Gaussian Processes in a method called Kriging. Another less expensive method uses the Parzen-Tree Estimator to construct two distributions for 'high' and 'low' points, and then finds the location that maximizes the expected improvement.J. S. Bergstra, R. Bardenet, Y. Bengio, B. K√©gl: Algorithms for Hyper-Parameter Optimization. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems: 2546‚Äì2554 (2011) Examples Examples of acquisition functions include probability of improvement, expected improvement, Bayesian expected losses, upper confidence bounds (UCB), Thompson sampling and hybrids of these.Matthew W. Hoffman, Eric Brochu, Nando de Freitas: Portfolio Allocation for Bayesian Optimization. Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence: 327‚Äì336 (2011) They all trade-off exploration and exploitation so as to minimize the number of function queries. As such, Bayesian optimization is well suited for functions that are expensive to evaluate. Solution methods The maximum of the acquisition function is typically found by resorting to discretization or by means of an auxiliary optimizer. Acquisition functions are typically well- behaved and are often maximized with implementations of Newton's Method such as Broyden‚ÄìFletcher‚ÄìGoldfarb‚ÄìShanno algorithm or the Nelder-Mead method. Applications The approach has been applied to solve a wide range of problems,Eric Brochu, Vlad M.

The company was founded by a Dutch ceramicist, Charles-Francois Hannong. Charles-Francois was born in Maastricht around 1669 and later married Anne Nikke, daughter of a German pipe-maker, in Cologne. In 1709 they moved to Strasbourg, where Charles-Fran√ßois set up a pipe-making factory. At first he concentrated on producing enamelled earthenware stoves. Around 1720 he was working with Henri Wackenfeld, perfecting these stoves and at the same time making experiments in porcelain, in which they attained a certain success, with great improvements being achieved by succeeding members of the Hannong family. Wackenfeld later left Strasbourg and Charles-Francois continued alone. By 1724, the faience was so successful that Charles-Francois opened a second factory in Haguenau. Eight years later he retired, leaving the family business to his sons, Paul-Antoine and Balthasar, who paid him an annual pension until his death in 1739. The decoration improved in 1744, when Paul perfected the method of applying gilding. Ten years later his success prompted him to apply for a licence to manufacture this porcelain. However, the director of the royal factory, the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres declined to issue a license, forcing him to close his works, which he transferred to Frankenthal in 1755, setting up the Frankenthal Porcelain Factory. When the French prohibition was relaxed in 1766, Paul's son Joseph resumed making porcelain at Strasbourg. He did not prosper, however, and in 1780 he fled to Germany because of debt. Production at the Strasbourg factory ceased, and the company went into bankruptcy. Over six decades, three generations of Hannongs had created innovative styles and techniques, raising earthenware to new levels of sophistication and finesse. The Hannongs were early practitioners of overglaze decoration in France, referred to as 'petit-feu' (small fire) in French. This involved a second firing at a lower temperature, making it possible to have a wider range of colours, including radiant reds, colours that had not been able to survive the traditional grand-feu firing temperature. Using this broad colour range, the Hannongs designed motifs of naturalistic flowers, often asymmetrically painted on plates and tureens. Strasbourg faience products include large tureens designed by Paul, in forms such as pumpkins and cabbages, as well as naturalistic figures of animals. His work ranged from ornate Rococo pieces, such as clock cases, to plates with unsophisticated floral decoration. The Strasbourg technique spawned a number of imitations including the ware of Marseilles, Niderviller, Luneville, St. Clement, Sceaux, Aprey, Lodi in northern Italy and the majority of the smaller factories in France. A large collection of this faience is on display in the Mus√©e des Arts d√©coratifs, Strasbourg. Haguenau's Mus√©e historique and Gertwiller's Mus√©e du pain d'√©pices also display valuable Hannong faience, as does the Castle \\"Favorite\\" on the other side of the Rhine.

Matches for the outings were gathered and analyzed first by a computer and then by a human to ensure strong matches. The excursions were planned in venues throughout 25 cities for six people. Groupers consisted of two groups of three friends and can consist of three males and three females, six males, six females, or any other possible combination. Michael Waxman founded the New York-based startup in 2011. The company was run by a staff of 25 people. In 2013, Time Inc. listed Grouper in its 10 NYC Startups to Watch for 2013. Three years later, in October 2016, the company shut down. How a Grouper works Grouper is an invite-only service that matches two individuals according to data found ‚Äì with the permission of the user ‚Äì on the user's Facebook profile, including age, career, education, etc. The company determines a match between two individuals using both algorithms and its member experience team. A time is then set for the \\"Grouper\\". The two parties are asked to each bring two friends. No names, photos, or information are disclosed before the actual meet. Upon arrival at the determined location, the group receives a complimentary first round of drinks, including tax and tip, at a reserved table (the cost is included in Grouper's service fee). The company offers arrangements for both opposite- and same-sex Groupers. Communication with users Grouper features real-time customer relationship management (CRM). The service also grants users direct contact with the director of membership experience, who engages users with personalized reminder texts and bits of advice for success on Groupers. The member experience team communicates with users throughout the Grouper. Users receive a customized message from the member experience team on the morning after their grouper inquiring as to the how the night out went. This feedback is analyzed and stored for future matching. Active cities and expansion For more than a year after its initial launch, Grouper was only available in New York City. By June 2012, the service had grown to San Francisco and Washington D.C. By September 2012, Grouper had expanded its services to 10 additional cities, Atlanta, Austin, Brooklyn, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Philadelphia, and Dallas. That December the service became available to users in Toronto. The company reported its services are officially available in 25 cities in the US and Toronto, including 2013 additions Nashville, Denver, and others. Additionally, Grouper London is launching in November 2013. Technological developments In April 2013, the meet-up service released its Grouper iPhone app. The company has reported that the app, which features push notifications and alerts, allows users to set up a Grouper in as little as an hour, avoiding the long questionnaires other services require their users to fill out. Partnerships and acquisitions Y Combinator, a company that funds startups, is the primary backing for Grouper. In October 2012, Grouper announced its Hackaton program. The concept involved flying select designers and software developers to New York City for a week-long, expenses-paid trip. The company invited the designers into their headquarters to work on new Grouper product development and brainstorm with the team. Grouper arranged the trip after establishing partnerships with Airbnb and Hipmunk. Grouper announced a partnership with Uber in January 2013. The alliance was made to encourage users to utilize Uber for transportation on Grouper dates.

Compton Terrace, an amphitheater in Phoenix was named in his honor and he was inducted into the Arizona Music & Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2005. Early life Compton was born in Henderson, Texas, but his family soon moved to Tyler, Texas where he attended John Tyler High School and got his first disc jockey job in 1964. Radio career Compton first began to influence Phoenix radio in 1969 when top-40 radio station KRUX-AM hired him to host a Sunday night free-form show. Using the on-air name of \\"Little Willie Sunshine,\\" Compton played a diverse collection of music‚Äîfolk, blues, jazz, and, of course, tracks on albums other than their hit singles. The opportunity arose for Compton to become the station manager of a failing Spanish-language station, KCAC-AM. At the time, KCAC was a low-power AM station that was only allowed to broadcast during daytime hours. Compton used it to continue the freeform format he had pioneered at KRUXhosting on-air shifts and hiring similarly minded disc jockeys such as Gary Kinsey (on-air name, Toad Hall) and Hank Cookenboo. Initially housed in a small house on Camelback Road, KCAC quickly attracted a loyal audience seeking an alternative to Top-40 radio. Mark Davis, a guest columnist in the Arizona Republic described its air sound: > Free-form programming as used by KCAC allows the individual announcer > complete discretion. This allows some of the innovations in rock air time > denied under Top 40 programming, as well as opening the door to other > musical forms. A typical show on KCAC will include elements of jazz, blues, > folk, classical, hillbilly, country, soul and, of course rock. The absence > of prescheduled news programs allows occasional hour-and-a-half collages of > uninterrupted music. KCAC could not sustain itself financially and went into bankruptcy in November 1970. The year after KCAC's demise, Compton helped bring FM station KDKB to the airwavesdebuting on August 23, 1971. He served as its first program director and, along with co-owner Dwight Tindle, developed its format as a progressive rock stationthe earliest FM station in Phoenix to adopt that format fulltime. Death Compton died in a car accident in June 1977, age 31.

History The trust was established as the Royal Cornwall Hospitals and West Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust on 1 November 1991, and became operational on 1 April 1992. It changed its name to its current name soon after on 9 June 1992. In June 2013, Martin Watts resigned from his post as Chair of the Trust after external investigations into two separate complaints were upheld. In October 2013, one of the trust's governors complained that the health and social care system in the county was dysfunctional because some elements of health care were no longer part of the NHS, but provided by what were \\"essentially private contractors\\". Community health services in the county are now provided by Peninsula Community Health The trust's plans to switch up to 450 jobs in catering, housekeeping, cleaning, portering, waste and switchboard functions to private companies were attacked by local Labour Party candidates in December 2013. In January 2019, the trust decided to move elective orthopaedic work out of Treliske to St Michael‚Äôs Hospital in Hayle, in order to protect the waiting list from the pressure of emergencies. This made room for a frailty unit at Treliske. The trust was one of the biggest beneficiaries of Boris Johnson's announcement of capital funding for the NHS in August 2019, with an allocation of ¬£100 million for a new women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs hospital in Truro. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. The trust established a cleaning contract with Mitie in 2014 worth ¬£90M over seven years. Sick pay cost ¬£1.2M in its first eight months compared with ¬£280,000 for the NHS in the previous financial year. UNISON blamed the rise on staff stress which it claimed had been caused by mistakes on pay. In October 2015, Bill Shields, the interim chief executive announced his resignation. The human resources director, company secretary, the interim chief operating officer and the interim director of financial recovery are also leaving. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected the hospital in June 2015 and rated safety in medical care and the accident and emergency department as ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù. In the last quarter of 2015, it had one of the worst performances of any hospital in England against the four-hour waiting target. In March 2016, the trust was rated as having a poor reporting culture in the Learning from Mistakes League. In October 2017, the CQC reported that patients were waiting too long for treatment and suffering harm as a result. There were long delays in cardiology and ophthalmology and unacceptable levels of operations canceled. There were shortages of midwives, and midwives were insufficiently equipped and trained They recommended that the trust be placed in special measures. In 2019, it was fined a total of ¬£16,250 for 13 separate breaches of the NHS statutory duty of candour after it failed to notify the patient or their family of the facts available in a safety investigation as soon as reasonably possible. Performance against the four-hour target improved from 56.6% in February 2018 to 94.1% in April. Sixty care home beds were purchased through the Better Care Fund with Cornwall Council, the number of homecare providers was increased from 20 to 40 and homecare workers were paid the National Living Wage. In the twelve months to September 2018, the trust was at OPEL level 4 a major crisis requiring external help for 134 days, the worst in England, with operations repeatedly cancelled. In 2018, the CQC rated the trust as requiring improvement.Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust When Scan4Safety was introduced in its pharmacies the trust managed to reduce dispensing errors by 76%.

Youpee, 519 U.S. 234 (1997), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a provision which escheats property to tribe upon owner's death any fractional interest in allotment which constitutes less than two percent of the allotment and has not produced $100 in income over the past five years, unless it is devised or descends to owner of another fractional interest in the allotment, works an unconstitutional taking.  Background  In the late 1800s, United States Congress initiated a program to allot Indian (Native American) tribal land to individual members of the tribes. Over the ensuing years, the ownership of the land became increasingly fractionalized as the original owners passed their interests onto multiple heirs. About 100 years later, Congress passed the Indian Land Consolidation Act in 1983 to deal with the problem. Section 207 of the act provided that the land would pass, or escheat, to the tribe when the interest was 2 percent or less and earned less than $100 in the preceding year.Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U.S. 234, 237-39 (1997). The Act did not provide those whose land went to the tribe with any compensation. A previous version of the Act was invalidated under the Fifth Amendment in Hodel v. Irving. While the case was still ongoing, Congress made changes to the statute to try and address the issues identified in Hodel.Youpee, 519 U.S. at 239-40. William Youpee was an enrolled member of the Sioux and Assiniboine Tribes. His will devised his fractional interests in several parcels of land to several other tribal members. An administrative law judge of the Department of the Interior found that the land should escheat to the tribal government. It was first appealed to the Board of Indian Appeals, which stated it did not have jurisdiction to determine the constitutional claim. The devisees then brought suit seeking relief, which the U.S. District Court granted. The suit claimed that ¬ß 207 violated the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.Youpee, 519 U.S. at 240-42.  Supreme Court = Opinion of the Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court. Ginsburg noted that Congress had changed the statute, but ended up not addressing any of the constitutional concerns of Hodel. She further noted that while the income from the land might be de minimis, nothing in the statute address the base value of the land itself. Since the statute authorized a taking of property without compensation to the property owner, it violated the Fifth Amendment and was invalid.Youpee, 519 U.S. at 243-45.  Dissent  Justice John P. Stevens dissented. He believed that Youpee had sufficient notice to prevent the loss of his interest in the property, and that the government had an interest in reducing the problems inherent in fractionalized ownership. He would have held the statute valid.Youpee, 519 U.S. at 245-47.

The Right Place. is a novel by Donald Harington which was published in 1973. It is a story about growing up and understanding how the world works. There are many aspects to life and all must be realized before true growth occurs. It was adapted into the film Return in 1985.  Plot overview  Diana Stoving seeks out Day Whittacker, the 18-year-old boy whose English teacher claims through hypnotism and age regression is Diana's dead grandfather Daniel Lyam Montross. Diana and Day travel together in search of the truth behind the hypnotism and Daniel's life. Intermixed with finding truth are unforeseen romances and events leading Diana and Day to unimaginable truths.  Extended plot  Overture Diana and Susan are driving when they hit a pot hole and must stop at a dealership. While there, Diana reads an article about age regression and decides to meet the teacher hypnotist that the article is about. After Susan leaves, Diana poses as a reporter and meets Mr. Sedgely who tells her about Day Whittacker after she shows interest in the boy claiming to be Daniel Lyam Montross. Diana goes to the Whittacker house and poses as a Life Magazine researcher. As Diana leaves, Day rushes out and asks for the truth. A few days after Diana's visit, Day disappears. In fact, Diana and Day go to Mr. Sedgely's house so Diana can see Day hypnotized and Mr. Sedgely enables Diana to put Day into a hypnotized state by saying, ‚ÄúGo to sleep.‚Äù Day cannot remember anything that happens under hypnosis. The next day Diana and Day leave for Connecticut and Diana puts Day to sleep, but can't figure out how to wake him up. As such, Day finally awakes disoriented and wanting to go back home. Eventually, the two arrive at Cornwall and are searching for Dudleytown in heavy rain. Day asks Miss Evans how to reach Dudleytown and she tells them of a road. The car gets stuck and Diana and Day must continue on foot. They find some cellar holes and Day builds a fire after the rain stops. They travel in the wrong direction and find shelter under a boulder. Diana hypnotizes Day and has ‚ÄúDaniel‚Äù lead her to his house. When Day awakens, they find the car and stay at the McDonough Motor Lodge where they learn the legend of Dudleytown and eat. That night, the two decide to stick together because neither has anything to believe in and they talk throughout the night. When Diana wakes up the next day, she thinks she's dreaming. She buys camping gear and finds Day hitchhiking when she returns because he thought that she left him. The two then set up camp and find a waterfall while hiking. Diana quickly skinny-dips but feels someone watching. However, Day is cooking dinner when she returns and they relax. First Movement: Landscape with Two Figures The first chapter goes into the past from Daniel's perspective at his birth. He was unwanted and just another mouth to feed. With Diana and Day, it is the next day and Diana goes shopping while Day digs. He gets put into a hypnotic state to determine what he dug up. During this time, both Diana and Day doubt the existence of Daniel. Going back to Daniel, his childhood was filled with a sickly mother and a severe father; at one point Daniel tried to avoid punishment by jumping out of a tree. Luckily, the tree saved him from falling to his death. During Diana and Day's time together, Diana has been recording Daniel's life and keeping a journal. As Daniel gets older, he learns about the truth behind babies and gets teased for not having a girlfriend until Hatttie Rose Pearl says that she'll be his and brings him candy. Diana realizes the attraction between her and Day, but doesn't want to be the first to act and actually avoids him. Daniel joins the oatsower's club and loses his virginity at age 11 to his cousin Violate. Diana makes a list of what she wishes to accomplish with Day, they dance, and Day finally listens to the recordings of Daniel. In the next section, the life of Diana and Day and Daniel combines. Diana and Day have sex while Daniel attempts to sleep with Hattie. At the point where Daniel is about to, Diana puts Day to sleep and has sex with Daniel. Later, Diana believes she's fallen in love with Daniel and she doesn't want to give Day attention. With Daniel, his parents actually found him and Hattie together and his mother demands that Daniel be punished. In actuality, Daniel's father is proud and only pretends to whoop Daniel. At this time, people are leaving Dudleytown and Violate decides that she wants Daniel, cheating on her boyfriend Renz. As Diana is out driving, she runs into an old man and asks him questions about the people that used to live in Dudleytown. Diana tries and fails to correlate the information from the old man and Daniel. Day tells Diana that no matter what happens, he loves her. Daniel narrates within the story of Diana and Day, saying that he loves Diana, but cannot be with her; therefore, he is giving her Day. Day courts Diana with singing and poem recitations and Diana dances. In Daniel's life, most of his family has left, except for his parents, his feeble-minded sister, and him. Daniel and Charity, his sister, perform sexual acts, eventually leading to sex. Charity becomes pregnant and leaves with her mother. Daniel learns of the family curse and his father is killed. He buries him alone and then his sick mother arrives. Seven guests arrive at Diana and Day's camp demanding food and drink before they go skinny-dipping at the waterfall. Marijuana gets passed around after the swim. Daniel must take care of his mother, when he suddenly remembers Diana and when he opens his eyes he thinks Zephaniah is Renz. Daniel describes when he tried to kill Renz. Diana's perspective is given about their seven guests. She wants them to leave, but they won't. She thinks Day is sleeping with Vashti, but she already slept with Zephaniah and can't say anything. Zephaniah borrows Diana's car with the promise that he and his friends will leave as soon as he returns. Jeeps arrive with men that want to scare everyone away, but also have sex with the girls. One of the men, George, attempts to go after one of the girls and Day attacks him. Eventually, everyone fought and ran away. Diana and Day hide out under the boulder until everyone is gone. Daniel sends his mother back to Illinois and leaves Dudleytown and heads to Vermont. Diana and Day leave Dudleytown on foot to follow Daniel's path to Vermont as fall begins. Second Movement ‚ÄúThe Unfinished‚Äù Day and Diana travel to Five Corners, Vermont. Day lied to Diana because he told her he'd never heard of Dudleytown or Five Corners, when he actually has. Day wonders if he made Diana up when they finally reach Five Corners. As Daniel's story continues, it is found out that he became a mail carrier, but he lost his job after staying at the celebration too long. However, he becomes a school teacher and stays with bachelor Jake Claghorn. Day and Diana use Daniel's memories to learn how to do things such as make hard apple cider. While drunk, Day and Diana read each other's diaries and quarrel the next day. While Daniel is school teacher, he becomes closer to Rachel and she tells him her story of going off with a man. Daniel meets Henry Fox and learns life lessons. Rachel and Daniel continue their sexual relationship until Rachel's mother catches them and blackmails Daniel into a sexual relationship with her. The question of an IT gets asked and Diana wonders if she has one, meaning a personal identity. Day bakes Diana a cake and makes her a necklace for her birthday, but she pouts about not getting what she wants so she hypnotizes Day and gets Daniel to giver her what she wants. Day and Daniel dance in the snow. Rachel catches Daniel and her mother together. Daniel continues teaching and works as a farmhand for Jirah Allen during the summer. Daniel stays with Rachel's family during the next school year and lives in the shed. Rachel began acting crazy that summer. Day turns 19 and Diana does nothing, but Daniel speaks to Day's subconscious. Diana tells Day about her life and then leaves to clear up the cemetery. When Diana doesn't return, Day searches for her and she has been shot. Day carries her to a farmhouse and wakes up at the hospital. When both are healed, they return to Five Corners because Diana says there is unfinished business. Day tries to become intimate with Diana, but gets stopped. Day summarizes Daniel's last few years at Five Corners where he worked as a carpenter, was briefly engaged with Rachel, and protected Henry Fox. Day suspects that Diana is in love with Daniel and he tells Diana of his childhood. That night, Day takes Diana while she sleeps. In Henry Fox's last tape, Daniel asks what love is. He finds out the Rachel is Henry Fox's daughter and that love requires two people to be willing to share everything and see each other as they really are. Daniel kills Marshall Allen the next day and leaves Five Corners. Day and Diana fight, resulting in Day attempting to hang himself from a tree. Third Movement: There and Here Poems telling the story of Lost Cove. Diana and Day travel south and are oblivious about their love towards each other. They must cross a ravine and find a deserted town with buildings still standing. When Daniel first arrives at Lost Cove, he sees three girls washing, one of which ends up as his future lover. Daniel is neither loved or hated in Lost Cove, but his carpentry skills allowed him peace to stay there. No one particularly liked Daniel and he was often made fun of for his name and accent. Daniel got sick, but was healed by Aunt Billie Ledyard. Daniel tries to befriend her husband, but gets turned away. Diana and Day are unused to being alone without the woods. They have difficulty building a fire, when the ghost of Flossie arrives. Day runs away and Diana gets told not to put her monthly rags in the fire, in which Diana informs the spirit that she is pregnant. Flossie gets angry because Diana and Day aren‚Äôt married. However, Flossie teaches them how to survive but meddles, so they beg Daniel to get rid of her. Daniel gets her to leave, but return for Christmas. Diana refuses to listen to Day and buys Christmas decorations and gifts, which depresses Day. Still, he searches for mistletoe for Diana. Daniel is still considered a stranger at Lost Cove at Christmas, but he leaves wooden toys for all the children in the hope of being accepted. He forgot about Amney and begs forgiveness. Diana and Day miss Flossie, but have furnished the house with furniture from other abandoned homes. They work on their lives together. Diana still struggles with knowing who she is. Flossie arrives and is unwelcomed until Diana and Day experience cabin fever. Then, they listen to all of Flossie's stories until she eventually tells the tale of Dan Montross. The Ghost's Song and Other Selected Poems Flossie sets the mood for her tale and uses sticks to represent aspects of Dan's life. The first is the carpenter, The second stick is Dan's rifle gun because he was an impressive shot. The third stick is simply wood for the fires Dan watched when he made moonshine for bartering purposes. The fourth stick represents a hitching post because Dan got a black hose named Henry. The fifth and sixth sticks are Dan's fiddle and bow that he taught himself to play. The seventh stick stands for a 3D image contraption that Dan traded for. The eighth stick represents the law coming for Dan. Flossie, then ninth stick, hides him and his horse. Frankie, Flossie's daughter, is the tenth stick that Dan and his best friend Swinn, the eleventh stick, fought over. The twelfth stick is Dan's motto, ‚ÄúSpeak softly and carry a big stick.‚Äù Flossie does not explicitly explain the thirteenth stick, only that it caused at least half his trouble and half his pleasure. Dan stayed in Lost Cove until he was almost 30. Flossie drops the sticks and tells them to pick one to hear a story. Day picks up the sixth stick, the bow, and Flossie says Dan turns from the fiddlers on stage to a girl listening, but watching Dan. He catches her gaze and is enthralled. He asks her to dance and they dance into the night. This girl is 16 and Dan walks her home, he tries to kiss her, but she disappears. As he returns home, Ammey reappears, silent, but takes his arm. The walk back together and Dan rambles trying to get her to talk. She kisses him to silence him. They have sex, but Dan is drunk and clumsy and enters the wrong place. Diana is excited to hear about her grandma, but Ammey has yet to speak a word. When Dan asks questions in regards to their actions, she simply replies, ‚Äúno.‚Äù So, Dan focuses on the sensations. Diana and Day decide to emulate the situation. Diana and Day reemerge and Flossie declares that Day will play the fiddle, Diana dance, and she will sing while Dan calls out his story. Ammey was basically used as a prostitute by her father to get food and bartering goods. Dan begs her to leave with him, but she is obedient to her father. As such, she gets sold to Walt Ailing as his wife, but she and Dan stay intimate resulting in her becoming pregnant. Ammey dies during childbirth and Dan spends month at her grave, drunk and mourning. Dan and Ailing have a gun duel, then Dan steals baby Annie and leaves. Diana apologizes to Day for what she said a long time ago that he couldn't tell Dan's story. A fire breaks out while they sleep. The section ends with a poem that presents the idea that dreams are made by creating a future while asleep. Fourth Movement: A Dream of a Small but Unlost Town This entire section is narrated by Dan, the spirit. ‚ÄúG‚Äù is shown with all his faults and told that he must take a paid leave of absence. After seeing his doctor, ‚ÄúG‚Äù gets put on bed rest and told that he needs to change his habits. ‚ÄúG‚Äù doesn't care, he is listless, until he decides to follow his estranged wife and daughters to Arkansas. He spends time with his daughters and reads an article about the missing Diana Stoving. He meets with Mr. and Mrs. Stoving and gets hired to find their daughter. After the meeting, ‚ÄúG‚Äù visits Susan and finds out that Diana read an article at the dealership. ‚ÄúG‚Äù searches for which paper was there at the time and searches for a shocking article that could change Diana's plans with Susan. He finds the article about age regression and visits Mr. Sedgely and Day's parents. However, ‚ÄúG‚Äù doesn't understand where Daniel Lyam Montross comes into the picture. He searches Dudleytown and researches Montross in the library. During his stay, he hears what happened during Diana and Day's last night in Dudleytown. Continuing his search, he travels to Five Corners and believes Day hung himself from the evidence left. He visits the clinic for his own ailments and finds out about Day's desire to travel south. To recover, ‚ÄúG‚Äù returns home for a while. To keep busy, he writes to southern states about ghost towns and learns of Lost Cove in North Carolina. Additionally, he learns that a house recently burned down in Lost Cove and ‚ÄúG‚Äù believes Diana has already left. He believes that she has most likely returned to Arkansas so he travels to ‚ÄúStick Around,‚Äù which is actually still inhabited on the outskirts and finds Daniel's house. When he arrives, the house shows signs of people living there, but no one is home. Diana sneaks up on him while in the garden and knows him as an author. As such, Diana tells ‚ÄúG‚Äù her and Day's story. After meeting Diana, ‚ÄúG‚Äù sends a telegram to Diana's father for her maternal grandfather's name and buys a rifle. ‚ÄúG‚Äù thinks Diana is delusional about Day still being alive, but plays along. Diana and ‚ÄúG‚Äù listen to Henry Fox's final tape and Diana allows ‚ÄúG‚Äù to read her diary. In order to prove Day is dead, ‚ÄúG‚Äù sets up a trap at the post office where Diana and Day send each other letters. ‚ÄúG‚Äù thinks Diana planted Day's tablets in the post office, but reads them while spying on the post office. ‚ÄúG‚Äù believes Day actually died and when he questions Diana, she says that he tried, but failed and that the last pages are written by her because he was in no condition to write. Later, ‚ÄúG‚Äù reads the poems and thinks Diana made up the parts about Day and the ghost. However, when ‚ÄúG‚Äù rereads the poems, he does not believe Diana would have been able to write them. The next day, Diana does not receive a letter form Day and ‚ÄúG‚Äù sees it as her transitioning to believing that he no longer exists. Continually, ‚ÄúG‚Äù asks for proof that Day exists. Diana shows ‚ÄúG‚Äù the ‚ÄúStick Around‚Äù tapes and all the stories of the town. That night, she shows him the writing on the wall and holds him as he sleeps. ‚ÄúG‚Äù dreams about his childhood and remembers Daniel Montross. ‚ÄúG‚Äù had actually lived in ‚ÄúStick Around‚Äù during his childhood. Diana explains how the writings of Daniel were done for her and they go to the post office. Once there, ‚ÄúG‚Äù takes the letter and runs, but has a heart attack. As a result, Diana decides to make ‚ÄúG‚Äù healthier and forces him to exercise. During this time, Daniel is watching Diana and ‚ÄúG,‚Äù as well as explaining how he raised Annie. When Annie went off with Burton Stoving, she was already pregnant and she and Daniel had a deal that he would get the child. However, she refused once she realized that Burton was sterile. Daniel kidnapped Diana; he is her father. Day meets Diana and ‚ÄúG‚Äù at the pond and they go back to the house to tell the final part of the story. ‚ÄúG‚Äù flashes back to his childhood encounter with Daniel when he was five. Daniel told him a story about searching for love and shows him a fork in the path, one path leading to town and the other to some other place. Now, ‚ÄúG‚Äù has found love in Diana, but it is not his so he must keep searching. ‚ÄúG‚Äù asks how Day got past his trap and finds out that there is a back to the counter. ‚ÄúG‚Äù reads the article about Daniel's shooting and Diana explains what really happened. ‚ÄúG‚Äù goes with Diana and Day to act out Daniel's final moments. When Daniel died, toddler Diana held him and looked into his eyes until the end. Finale ‚ÄúG‚Äù writes a letter to Diana's father. It states that Diana is alive and well, but it is up to her to decide to contact him. Diana writes ‚ÄúG‚Äù a letter. She tells him that she's happy he has returned home to his family and that he is taking better care of his health. She also told him to title their story Some Other Place, The Right Place.

TAOTAO is an epic tale that follows six generations of \\"Stay Morons\\", beginning with its first settlers Jacob and Noah Ingledew, who travel from their native Tennessee to the Ozark region of Arkansas to found the imaginative town of Stay More. There are twenty chapters total in TAOTAO, each chapter opening with a pencil sketch of a building that the story builds upon.  Plot  The first chapter begins with a sketch of a rounded, bigeminal house (Bigeminality is a major theme in the story). While in the Ozark region of Arkansas, the shy Jacob Ingledew meets the native Indian Fanshaw, who lives in the bigeminal house. The pair of them become friends, and they spend time together philosophizing on matters including the existence of God or Wahkontah. They also debate on who deserves to stay in the town of Stay More. At one point Fanshaw tells Jacob to sleep with his wife, which leads to her impregnation. Then Fanshaw and his woman leave Stay More after revealing to Jacob that he impregnated Fanshaw's woman. A clock peddler named Eli Willard, who passes by the town of Stay More sells a clock to Jacob and Noah Ingledew. Later, Noah contracts the frakes, a mysterious disease that causes the afflicted to lose interest and motivation in life. Jacob tries to cure Noah of his frakes with urine from a panther. Lizzie Swain and her fourteen children settle near the Ingledew brothers into a home that Jacob helps build out of trees. Sarah Swain, one of Lizzie Swain's daughters, marries Jacob. The newlywed couple move into their own bigeminal house, which Jacob also builds himself. But then a string of unfortunate events occur; Jacob contracts the frakes and the people of Stay More suffer through a drought. When rain finally arrives, it floods. A woman by the name of Viridiana Boatright sleeps with most of the men in Stay More. The men of Stay More contract the frakes and they suspect Viridiana gave them the frakes. Jacob becomes the governor of Arkansas, and Sarah the First Lady. The people of Stay More, also called Stay Morons, establish a post office so Eli Willard can communicate with its residents. Lum sets up a general merchandise store in Stay More too. The clock peddler Eli Willard struggles to sell his grooming aids to the Stay Morons, despite how idiotic he thinks them to be. Soon the aged Jacob passes away, and his wife Sarah dies the next day. Around the early 1900s Willis Ingledew buys a Ford Model T. Jealous of his brother‚Äôs new car, John decides to build a bank so that he can later take money from the bank to pay for his own Model Ford T. Around the same time a constitutional amendment is added that bans the sale and possession of alcoholic drinks. When the 1920s roll around, Eli Willard, now the oldest man alive, still tries to sell goods to the Stay Morons. He presents Hank with his gold chronometer to pass down to Hank‚Äôs future son. Hank impregnates a woman named Sonora, whom he then marries. Then he joins the U.S. Navy during World War II. Hank and Sonora wish to name their baby after the clock peddler who game them his gold chronometer, but by the time they conceive a boy they forget about Eli Wiillard and, instead, name their boy Vernon. Like most of the men in Stay More who contracted the frakes, Vernon too gets the frakes, but the narrator of TAOTAO informs its readers that Vernon will eventually find a cure for the frakes. After digging around his yard, Hank finds the golden chronometer for Vernon. Once Vernon wears the watch from Eli Willard he becomes aware of the reader and the narrator of the story. The narrator tells Vernon to catch a razorback. While in pursuit of catching the razorback boar, Vernon breaks his watch, so he takes it to a clock repairman who offers to buy the watch. But Vernon declines his offer. By the end of the story Vernon and Jelena Duckworth become a couple who will live in a domicile built by Vernon. The narrator will visit them and try to persuade Vernon to provide a better resting place for Eli Willard.

Election as Exarch of Russian Tradition in Western Europe and criticism  His election as Patriarchal Exarch for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe in November 2013 was heavily influenced by the Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, at the suggestion of the Metropolitan Emmanuel of France, his consecration taking place on 30 November of the same year in the Patriarchal Church, by the Patriarch and by Synodal Hierarchs As a consequence, the election of Archbishop Job was achieved after two unknown names were placed on the ballot at a late stage in the election process, inducing the electors to vote for Job Getcha. Job Getcha‚Äôs tenure as archbishop was marked by deep divisions within the archdiocese concerning the manner in which he has discharged his pastoral responsibilities.  Promotion to Patriarchate's representative  On 28 November 2015 the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate appointed Archbishop Job as the Patriarchate's representative to the World Council of Churches at Geneva and removed from the office of Exarch, thus remaining an Archbishop but free of any further pastoral or administrative role in the Archdiocese he formerly had in his care.http://www.exarchat.eu/spip.php?article1778 Representing the new generation of the ecumenical dialogue with the Christian Churches, Job Getcha is described as a discrete and serious theologian and much appreciated by his Latin Catholic counterparts of Commission for Theological Dialogue.

Toby) With is a novel published in 2003 by Donald Harington. The story takes place in Stay More, Harington's mythical town in Newton County, Arkansas. With is part love story and part survival story about a girl's development into a woman while living in isolation and seclusion from the rest of society.  Plot  Part One: Parted With A man named Sog Alan travels up and down Madewell Mountain with his dog Hreapha to get supplies at a store. While buying supplies for his so-called 'dream girl', Sog looks for a girl to abduct. He spots a beautiful, young girl who happens to be the daughter of Karen Kerr, a lady whom Sog had previously issued a speeding ticket to. After stalking Robin, Sog makes an attempt to abduct her. He knocks on Robin's front door, pretending to be her grandfather. Robin nearly falls for his tricks, but she does not open the door for Sog. Eventually Sog successfully abducts Robin at a skating rink and takes her to an abandoned house at the top of Madewell Mountain. He offers Robin an assortment of presents. Then Robin asks Sog three questions; she asks him if he will take her home, why he picked her, and if he is going to rape her. Part Two: Sleeping With Robin's Grandfather Leo discovers Robin's disappearance. Police officers hold Leo captive as a suspect. Meanwhile, at Madewell Mountain Sog uses a flashlight as a makeshift nightlight for Robin. The next day Robin is gone. Robin tries to return to her family, but she fails to find her way out of the mountains. Sog finds Robin with Hreapha's help. All the while, Sog suffers from impotence and illness, thus preventing him from raping Robin. Robin begins to settle into her new surroundings in the mountains; she learns how to cook and clean. And she befriends Hreapha, a ghost of a boy named Adam Madewell, and other wild animals like beavers and even a bobcat. Robin's mother Karen makes an appearance on television to directly address Robin's abductor. Part Three: Without Ten years pass and Robin's parents have yet to reunite with their daughter. One day Sog wakes up without his usual body ailments, so he attempts to have intercourse with Robin, but Robin's animal friends retaliate, preventing Sog from getting what he wants. Later, Robin shoots Sog and kills him. With Sog gone, Robin grows closer to the in-habit Adam Madewell, but she does not try to return home to her parents. Instead, she remains with all of her animal companions at their house. Part Four: Within Robin does not hear the in-habit for a long time, so she is convinced that he is not a figment of her imagination. She asks Adam if he wants to sleep with her, but he does not reply until warmer weather arrives. Then Robin asks Adam the in-habit if he ever gets bored. He replies that he never gets bored because there is always something going on in the world. Hreapha gives Robin a pet snake for her birthday. Then she journeys to Stay More to see Yowrfrowr again with her children. A drought occurs near the end of summer, so Robin struggles to keep herself clean and the chickens alive. Hrolf and the other animals set out to find a bear cub for Robin's twelfth birthday. They struggle to stay hydrated during their search. Robert finds a living bear cub within a cave. Under the command of Hrolf's mother, Dewey carries the bear cub on his back to present to Robin for her birthday. Robin feels overjoyed when she receives the bear cub for her birthday. She names the bear cub after her stuffed animal Paddington. Robin's menagerie continues to grow each year as she receives more animal pets for her birthdays. The in-habit Adam becomes more attuned to the differences in maturity level between Robin and himself. Part Five : Wither With Her Robin, now sixteen years old, decides to make contact with the world outside her menagerie and imagination. She meets Yowrfrowr and Latha Dill. Latha shows Robin around Stay More. She asks Robin to call her mother Karen to let her know that she is still alive, but Robin prefers to keep her whereabouts secret. In return for Latha's hospitality, Robin leaves ten thousand dollars on Latha's bed. Robin wants her animal friends to help find her a male counterpart. So, Hrolf hosts a meeting among the animals of the house to devise a plan to find a man for Robin. In the meantime, Adam(not to be confuse with the in-habit Adam) revisits his old home up in Madewell Mountain. Adam finally reaches his old house where Robin resides. The story shifts to future tense. Robin will reunite with her mother Karen and tell her and her new husband Hal about Sugrue Alan. Karen will try to make Robin reconsider her decision to stay with Adam. Robin will decline any publicity of her existence. Robin will appreciate the solitude and comfort of quiet after experiencing more of the sounds of civilization. Robin will thank Sugrue's ghost for making her life as she knows it possible.

Magers, \\"Police Officer Standard and Training Commissions (POST Commissions)\\" in Encyclopedia of Law Enforcement: International (ed. Larry E. Sullivan: SAGE, 2005), pp. 349-351.Steven G. Brandl, Police in America (SAGE, 2015), p. 105. Policing in the United States is highly fragmented,Jeffrey S. Magers, \\"Police Officer Standard and Training Commissions (POST Commissions)\\" in Encyclopedia of Law Enforcement: International (ed. Larry E. Sullivan: SAGE, 2005), pp. 349-351. and there are no national minimum standards for licensing police officers in the U.S.Steven M. Cox, Susan Marchionna & Brian D. Fitch, Introduction to Policing (SAGE, 2015). Terminology The agency that establishes standards for police officer selection, training, licensure, certification, and suspension/decertification is called the police officer standards and training (POST) commission in 15 states (as of 2004), including CaliforniaCommission Policy Manual, California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (2017). and Arizona.James A. Conser, Rebecca Paynich & Terry E. Gingerich, Law Enforcement in the United States (3d ed.: Jones & Barlett, 2013), p. 231. In other states, the certification body goes by a different name, such as the Kentucky Law Enforcement Council, Massachusetts Municipal Training Council, Indiana Law Enforcement Training Board, Maryland Police and Corrections Training Commissions, Alaska Police Standards Council, and the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards. History Although the Wickersham Commission established by President Herbert Hoover called for the establishment of standards for police officers (including minimal training requirements, selection standards, physical standards, and police training before and during service), state standards for selecting and training police began to be adopted only in the latter half of the 20th century. Early advocates of professionalization and reform of police included August Vollmer of the Berkeley Police Department and O. W. Wilson of the Chicago Police Department. The California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (the first body to use the acronym \\"POST\\") was established in 1959. In the same year, New York enacted the New York Training Act, which established an advisory council to make recommendations on police training to the governor. In addition to California and New York, the states of Montana and Minnesota established their POST commissions in 1959.Model Minimum Standards, International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (revised February 2020), p. i. New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Oregon followed two years later. The 1967 Katzenbach Commission (President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice) and the 1973 National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals both encouraged establishment of a POST commission in each state to set minimum standard standards for selection, training, and certification. Between 1959 and 1976, 43 state police officer standards and training bodies were established.Raymond A. Franklin, Matthew Hickman & Marc Hiller, 2009 Survey of POST Agencies Regarding Certification Practices (July 2009), performed by the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Assistance. At the behest of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of State Directors of Law Enforcement Training (NASDLET) was established in 1970; the association changed its name to the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) in 1987. The last states to establish commissions were Tennessee, West Virginia, and Hawaii. Powers and variation across states Standards for police officers are not uniform; different states have different requirements. However, the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST), a cooperative association of leaders of various state police certification and licensing programs, has published a recommended set of \\"model minimum state standards\\" in 2004. However, there is a substantial variations in standards. More progressive police departments place greater emphasis on accreditation. Police trainingInitial training (police academy)= A study in the year 2000 found that the minimum number of police training hours varied from 320 to 800. In some states, the minimal training time for officers set by state regulation is shorter than the training time to become a licensed barber, cosmetologist, or manicurist, although many police departments have training requirements in excess of the state minimum.Holly Yan & Alberto Mier, States require more training time to become a barber than a police officer, CNN (September 28, 2016). In some states, the standards and certification body also directly runs the police academy. A Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) study found that as of 2013, about 4.5% of U.S. state and local law enforcement training academies were operated by a state POST commission.Brian A. Reaves, NCJ 249784: State and Local Law Enforcement Training Academies, 2013, U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (July 2016). The 2013 BJS study found that academies run by state POST agencies and colleges/universities were more likely to use a \\"nonstress\\" training model (based on \\"academic achievement, physical training, and a more relaxed and supportive instructor‚Äìtrainee relationship\\") as opposed to a \\"stress\\" training model (a military-style training regime based on \\"intensive physical demands and psychological pressure\\"). This contrasts with academies run by police forces, which more often are based on a stress model. Although state POST commissions run only a small proportion of police academies, POST commission- run academies have larger faculty sizes: an average of 30 full-time instructors and 81 part-time instructors, as of 2006, according to a BJS report.Brian A. Reaves, NCJ 222987: State and Local Law Enforcement Training Academies, 2006, U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (February 2009, revised April 14, 2009). =In-service training requirements= In some states, police officers are required to undergo continuing education (\\"in-service training\\")Steven M. Cox, Susan Marchionna & Brian D. Fitch, Introduction to Policing (SAGE, 2015). that is reported to and tracked by the state certifying body. Experts favor in-service training because it offers insights to police officers on newer research and best practices. However, in some states, in-service training requirements are minimal, and is frequently delivered online rather than hands-on.Martha Bellisle, Police 'woefully undertrained' on using force, experts say, Associated Press (June 12, 2020). Moreover, in some states where continuing police education is mandatory, funding for training and mechanisms for tracking compliance are lacking. Massachusetts requires police officers to undergo 40 hours of in-service police training each year, one of the nation's highest requirements, but lacks a statewide body overseeing compliance, and a 2019 state auditor report indicated that up to 30 police departments in the state might be out of compliance with the mandate. =Curricula= Police training curricula vary widely. Many police academies use military- or paramilitary-style training models; Rosa Brooks, an expert on policing training at Georgetown University Law Center, argues that this training model is harmful and contributes to the militarization of police.Matthew Brown, Do military-style police academies instill a mean streak in some officers?, Desert News (June 14, 2020).Rosa Brooks, Stop Training Police Like They're Joining the Military, The Atlantic (June 10, 2020). Between 2014 and 2017, many state legislatures adopted legislation requiring police officers to receive crisis intervention and deescalation training,State Trends in Law Enforcement Legislation: 2014-2017, National Conference of State Legislatures (September 24, 2018). which has been demonstrated to reduce police use of force.Curtis Gilbert, Not Trained to Not Kill: Most states neglect ordering police to learn de-escalation tactics to avoid shootings, APM Reports, American Public Media (May 5, 2017). As of 2017, however, 34 states do not require deescalation training for all police officers, and other states require minimal training in deescalation (for example, 1 hour per year in Georgia). While local departments can train officers in deescalation in the absence of a state mandate, many departments do not do so because of a lack of funding or trained instructors, and because of cultural attitudes among police and police leaders, such as the belief that such training is not necessary or is a criticism of policing itself. As of 2018, 27 states and District of Columbia require police officers to undergo training on interacting with individuals with mental, substance use, or behavioral disorders. =Gaps and flaws in training= Because there are no federal standards for officer firearms training, standards vary by state.Martha Bellisle, AP Exclusive: Accidental shootings show police training gaps, Associated Press (December 9, 2019). In most states, officers do not receive firearms training sufficient for the proficient handling of guns in real-world scenarios. For police cadets, a total of 40 hours of initial firearms training is required in Georgia, Illinois and Indiana; 52 hours in Utah; 66 hours in Missouri; 80 hours in Florida; and 90 hours in Washington state. After initial graduation from police academy, most officers are qualified in minimal firearms proficiency only once or twice annually, and firearms skills degrade rapidly. Experts attribute these training gaps to a significant number of accidental shootings (unintentional discharges) by police officers. An Associated Press report found that there were 1,422 unintentional discharges by officers at 258 law enforcement agencies of all sizes between 2012 to December 2019, and that these unintentional discharges caused injuries (to officers, suspects and bystanders) 20% of the time and caused death 8% of the time. Experts, such as police instructors and researchers, similarly identify training of U.S. police officers on the use-of-force techniques as inadequate. A two-year study conducted by the Force Science Institute, a Minnesota-based police research and consulting firm, found that \\"skills like using a baton or taking down an aggressive offender deteriorate dramatically within two weeks.\\" Police training in the United States has often been plagued by pseudoscience, junk science, and questionable science, with various common elements of police training being underpinned by misinformation, unsubstantiated claims, assumptions, and anecdotes.Scott O. Lilienfeld & Kristin Landfield, Science and Pseudoscience in Law Enforcement, Criminal Justice and Behavior, Vol. 35 (10): 16, October 1, 2008.Kelly McLaughlin, Police training programs have a pseudoscience problem, Insider (June 17, 2020). Many police practices taught in training are not evidence-based or supported by empirical research. For example, the \\"21-foot Tueller Drill\\"--based on the assumption that if a suspect is \\"any closer than 21 feet, the person could charge before an officer could unholster their gun\\"--is not scientific, and its creator has said the drill should not be taken literally; nevertheless, the drill is still commonly taught in police training as a science and has been used as an argument to justify police use of force. The American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and other experts proposed evidence-based policing and the creation of an \\"independent, nonpartisan body providing research and education to police departments\\" based on rigorous evidence. Certification Most states require a person to be certified before he or she may be hired as a police officer; as of 2020, four states, including Massachusetts, lacked a statewide police certification system.Christopher Gavin, Mass. lawmakers are readying for a police certification system. Here's what would make it strong, according to experts., Boston.com (June 16, 2020). As of 2009, 23 states with a certification process exempted certain personnel (usually elected sheriffs, and less commonly, police chiefs, state police officers, and reserve police officers) from the certification requirement. In a minority of states, police certifying bodies also certify other public safety employees, such as correctional officers (23 states), parole officers and probation officers (21 states) and police dispatchers (15 states). Decertification By 1998, 11 states' commissions lacked decertification authority--the power to revoke a license to work as a police officer--largely because of police union opposition.\\"Disciplinary Actions\\" in Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States, Human Rights Watch (1998). By 2016, six states (Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, California and Hawaii) still lacked decertification authority.Sarah Childress, How States Are Moving to Police Bad Cops, Frontline, PBS (April 8, 2016). In a 2009 survey, almost all states reported that they had the authority to revoke an officer's certificate upon conviction of a felony; a smaller number of states reported that they had the authority to revoke an officer's certificate upon conviction of any misdemeanor or for certain misdemeanors. Entities in 36 states reported that they could administratively revoke an officer's certificate for police misconduct; and entities in 31 states reported that they had the authority to temporarily suspend an officer's certificate. States differ dramatically in the number of officers decertified.A national registry of problem police officers would require major changes by states, Associated Press (June 26, 2020). At least since the late 1990s, Georgia has been the most active state in decertifying \\"problem\\" officers. Over the period 2015-2019, Georgia decertified 3,239 officers, Minnesota decertified 21, and Maryland decertified only one.A national registry of problem police officers would require major changes by states, Associated Press (June 26, 2020). In some states, the decertification process has drawn scrutiny because a lack of speed and transparency.Ryan J. Foley, Iowa can take years to decertify officers for crimes, Associated Press (June 26, 2020). In some states, a law enforcement agency must report the firing (or the firing for cause) of a police officer to the state certifying commission; in other states, a law enforcement agency only needs to report to the state certifying commission when an officer is arrested or convicted of a crime (or, in some states, a felony); and in some states, there is no notification obligation even under those circumstances.Nomaan Merchant, A 50-state look at officer decertification for sex incidents, Associated Press (November 3, 2015). For example, in Maine, \\"Agencies must tell the state about officers arrested or convicted of a crime, as well as those fired or allowed to resign for misconduct.\\" In Montana, law enforcement agencies are not required to report officer misconduct, but must notify the state commission of a termination of an officer within 10 days. In Indiana, there is \\"no requirement for agencies to inform the state about officer arrests or noncriminal misconduct allegations.\\" An Associated Press (AP) investigation in 2020 found that 17 officers were decertified in Iowa from 2018 to June 2020, mostly after being convicted of felonies, domestic violence, or certain other crimes in which removal is mandatory under Iowa law. Although removal is mandatory is such cases, the AP found that it was routine for a year or more to elapse, following officers' convictions, before the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Council filed petitions seeking decertification, and that it was common for another year to go by for decertification to become final (after a hearing before an administrative law judge and a vote by the council). During the 2-year period, only a single Iowa officer had been \\"decertified for improper police work alone\\" (an officer who filed false reports and made an arrest without probable cause). Iowa enacted a law in June 2020 to strengthen the decertification process by, among other things, requiring the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Council to decertify officers who engage in \\"serious misconduct\\" (such as fabricating evidence or repeatedly using excessive force) and by requiring police departments to report details of an officer's misconduct to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy Council within 10 days after the officer resigns or is terminated. In 1999, IADLEST, with funding from the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance, established the National Decertification Index (NDI), a database of decertified officers.Roger L. Goldman, NDI: Tracking Interstate Movement of Decertified Police Officers, Police Chief Magazine (September 12, 2018). As of 2005, only 13 states participated in the national decertification database; by 2018, that number rose to 43. NDI has received no federal funding since 2005, and is privately maintained. The database does not contain the reasons for the decertification; a hit on a decertified officer's name will refer the person conducting the query to the specific agency that decertified the officer. Law professor Roger L. Goldman, an expert on police certification, notes that \\"Since the grounds for decertification vary greatly among U.S. states, the fact of decertification does not mean the officer is automatically ineligible to be an officer in the state to which he or she has moved. For example, in some states, conviction of a felony is the only grounds for decertification; whereas, in other states, the commission of specified misconduct, such as filing a false police report, could trigger decertification.\\" As a result, an officer whose license is suspended in one state for misconduct, or even for conviction of a crime, may be able to find a police job in another state with laxer requirements. In its 1998 report Shielded from Justice: Police Brutality and Accountability in the United States, Human Rights Watch recommended that all states have decertification authority; that federal legislation should be adopted to create a database of state POSTs' records \\"so that 'problem' or abusive officers are not allowed to obtain law enforcement employment in a neighboring state\\"; and that decertification procedures \\"should be reinvigorated and fully funded.\\" A 2015 AP investigation uncovered numerous incidents of police officers who were terminated or resigned from a police agency after being accused of sexual misconduct, were then rehired by a different policy agency, and were subsequently accused again of misconduct.

Prior to the HCE architecture, near field communication (NFC) transactions were mainly carried out using secure elements. HCE enables mobile applications running on supported operating systems to offer payment card and access card solutions independently of third parties while leveraging cryptographic processes traditionally used by hardware-based secure elements without the need for a physical secure element. This technology enables the merchants to offer payment cards solutions more easily through mobile closed-loop contactless payment solutions, offers real- time distribution of payment cards and allows for an easy deployment scenario that does not require changes to the software inside payment terminals. History The term \\"host card emulation\\" (HCE) was coined in 2012 by Doug Yeager and Ted Fifelski, the founders of SimplyTapp, Inc., describing the ability to open a communication channel between a contactless payments terminal and a remotely hosted secure element containing financial payment card data, allowing financial transactions to be conducted at a point-of-sale terminal. They have implemented this new technology on the Android operating system. At that time, RIM had a similar functionality, calling it \\"virtual target emulation\\", which was supposed to be available on the BlackBerry Bold 9900 device through the BB7 operating system. Prior to HCE, card emulation only existed in physical space, meaning that a card could be replicated with multiple-purpose secure element hardware that is typically housed inside the casing of a smart phone. After the adoption of HCE by Android, Google had hoped that by including HCE in the world's largest mobile operating system (which by that time covered 80% of the market), it would offer the Android payments ecosystem a chance to grow more rapidly while also allowing Google themselves to deploy their Google Wallet more easily across the mobile network operator ecosystem. However, even with the inclusion of HCE in Android 4.4, the banks still needed the major card networks to support HCE. Four months later, at Mobile World Congress 2014, both Visa and MasterCard made public announcements about supporting the HCE technology. On December 18, 2014, less than ten months after Visa and MasterCard announced their support for HCE, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) became the first North American financial institution to launch a commercial implementation of mobile payments using the HCE technology. As a result of widespread adoption of HCE, some companies offer modified implementations that usually focus on providing additional security for the HCE's communication channel. One such implementation is termed HCE+. Impact NFC has faced adoption issues due to lack of infrastructure (terminals) and the secure element approach preventing organizations with the desire to participate in mobile payments from doing so due to the high up-front capital costs and complex partner relationships. By supporting HCE in Android 4.4, Google enabled any organization that can benefit from the NFC technology to do so at a relatively low cost. Some areas the new HCE architecture can support include payments, loyalty programs, card access and transit passes. Implementation Host card emulation is the ability for near field communication (NFC) information transfer to happen between a terminal configured to exchange NFC radio information with an NFC card and a mobile device application configured to act or pretend to emulate the functional responses of an NFC card. HCE requires that the NFC protocol be routed to the main operating system of the mobile device instead of being routed to a local hardware-based secure element (SE) chip configured to respond only as a card, with no other functionality. Since the release of Android 4.4, Google has implemented HCE within the Android operating system. Google introduced platform support for secure NFC-based transactions through Host Card Emulation (HCE), for payments, loyalty programs, card access, transit passes, and other custom services. With HCE, any app on an Android 4.4 device can emulate an NFC smart card, letting users tap to initiate transactions with an app of their choice. Apps can also use a new Reader Mode so as to act as readers for HCE cards and other NFC-based transactions. The first known mobile handset to support anything like HCE outside of the Android family was the BlackBerry bold 9900 that was first available in Thailand. released together with BlackBerry 7 OS. CyanogenMod operating system was the next known mobile device operating system to support HCE through the effort of modifying the NXP NFC stack known as libnfc-nxp, the NFC service manager, and operating system APIs by Doug Yeager. The OS APIs were adapted to include two new tag types that were called ISO_PCDA and ISO_PCDB which are also known terminal or PCD standards. This would imply that you could \\"read\\" a tag in the same manner that you could read a terminal. Microsoft has announced new support for HCE NFC payments in Windows 10\\\\. This will allow improved payment integration flows and enable coexistence of HCE with UICC-based secure elements in Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. Uses HCE is used to allow transactions between mobile devices and other credential acquiring devices. Those devices may include other mobile devices, contactless point-of-sale terminals, transit turnstiles, or a variety of access control touch pads. For example, Android developers can leverage HCE to create specific payment experiences, such as using HCE to enable a mobile application as a transit card.

To the east of the summit is a flat area, almost 2 square kilometres in area, called the Hohe-Loog-Ebene (\\"Hohe Loog Plain\\") at a height of about . The Hohe Loog has a northeastern outlier, the Rutschsteinberg. Its southeastern counterpart is the Rittersberg, with its conciliation cross (S√ºhnekreuz); the Rittersberg in turn leads to the Schlossberg, the hill on which Hambach Castle stands. To the north the Hohe Loog drops into the valley of Kaltenbrunnertal. Near the summit is the Hohe Loog House, managed by the Palatine Forest Club, which has an outstanding view of the Kalmit massif and the Rhine Valley.  Routes to the summit  The Hohe Loog may be climbed on several signed trails established by the Palatine Forest Club. From Neustadt the route runs along the Kaltenbrunner Tal or via the Nollenkopf. The mountain is also accessible from Diedesfeld via Hambach Castle and the Rittersberg. Another ascent is possible through the Klausental valley from Maikammer.

It tells the story of Bert Ljung from 1 January to 30 April during the calendar year he turns 13. The book uses the 1989 almanac following the Gregorian Calendar. On 19 January, the book version mentions the year being 1989, but the cassette tape recording mentions no specific year at all. The book also mentions √Öke as a \\"76:er\\". As standard, Bert opens the chapters with the words \\"Hej hej hall√• dagboken!\\" and finishes with \\"Tack och hej ‚Äì leverpastej\\". Bert writes diary for each day during this calendar year, and most notes depicts what happened yesterday. Originally, the Berts betraktelser trilogy appeared in the radio program Almanackan during 1989, where one program was done each day during one year, which S√∂ren thought was fitting well for a diary. For first time, Sonja H√§rdin illustrated the books. Book cover The book cover depicts Bert in his untidy room, and the almanac date of 1 January. A candle is burning at the table, and two eyes watch out from under his bed. On the floor are Phantom comic books, and a spider hangs down the book title text. On the wall is Bert's electric bass, and cards of different girls. Even the text \\"SH ‚Äì 89\\" is seen. Plot The Christmas-New Year holiday season goes towards its end, and Bert writes in his new diary. When √Öke returns home from a holiday to the Canary Islands, the pop/rock band Heman Hunters (which has been required to change name from \\"Dum i huvet\\" (\\"Stupid in the head\\") as the old band name gave no gigs) meets at √Öke, and here the band gets its recurring line-up. Soon, the spring term in the 6th grade begins. Bert is still together with Nadja, but when a new guy in his class appears, she tells him he \\"looks pretty good\\". During a break-in at the Beckaskolan school canteen, Bert believes/hopes the new guy in Nadja's class did the break-in, before Nadja tells that a 56 years old man did the break in. When Bert goes to Nadja, her raggare, brothers forces him to do a \\"raggare PRYO \\". In January, Bert's neighbour \\"kapten\\" (\\"captain\\") dies when his favourite bandy team loses an important televised game, and the municipality responses for the funeral as he has no relatives still alive. Bert and √Öke decide to attend the funeral, and read a poem. When the king of Sweden has his name day on 28 January Bert and √Öke set up fireworks for him in the park, using √Öke's home-made fireworks, who fly away in a one-way direction towards a house. When Bert visits Nadja, he puts cotton balls in her ear to avoid hearing her playing the violin, which turns her angry and she fights with the violin bow, which hits the cotton ball in Bert's ear. In late January, Bert's father tries to get Bert's family into dieting, but some days later it all ends when his mother finds sausage on his father 's necktie when he has been out dining with work. In February, Bert tricks his grandmother to call \\"Heta linjen\\" when his parents travel to the √Öland Island. When Bert is about to turn 13 on 21 February, he and √Öke start longing for moped, two years before the laws of Sweden would allow them to drive one. However, they manage to borrow mopeds from a lessor. Bert also pawns his father's wedding ring, but regrets his acting when noticing √Ögren, who he believes has been sent out by God, and Bert purchase the wedding ring again, despite it being more expensive this time. As Bert turns 13 he receives a greeting hug from Paulina in class 6 B, and his interest for Nadja slowly starts to decline. During Bert's birthday party, which Nadja doesn't attend, Bj√∂rna invites Bert's mother for a dance (which Lill-Erik mimics some days later by borrowing Bert's mother's bra), and Torleifs recorder flute breaks apart as Bert's mother locks it up in the refrigerator. On 1 March Bert goes to Nadja and breaks up with her, and soon shows his interest for Paulina. The guys in Bert's class hold a \\"penis measuring contest\\" in March, which Bert wins when he starts thinking of Paulina. As optional subject for the 7th grade, Bert chooses media, which Paulina also does. Bert also accidentally tells Paulina he has a dog, when she tells him she likes dogs. However, Bert has no dog, and is parents are allergic. An attempt to make Lill-Eriks dachshund look like a poodle fails. Bert also receives new neighbours, as Italian immigrant family Panatta from Sundsvall moves into recently deceased neighbour Kapten's former apartment, and a party is held. In April, Bert does his PRAO at the \\"Kurres bensin & tillbeh√∂r\\" petrol station, even if he wanted to do it at the fire station, a place that J√∂rgen Karlsson takes. The guys in Bert's class use Bj√∂rna's drill to drill a whole in the girls physical education changing room. Bert still likes Paulina, and wishes he had a secret telephone line over to class 6 B, as he knows Paulina does well at school, and could have help him during homework tests. During a wild school dance (where a 7th grade girl shows the guard her breast) at Jungbergska skolan, Bert learns that Paulina's mother is actually a cousin to Nadja's father. Bert also fixes a practice hall for the Heman Hunters, located in the basement of the apartment building where Bert's family lives. The neighbours first think the noise coming from the basement are abuse, and the ambulance and the police appears, before the band sings for the rescue staff. The book ends with an image of a pencil, and the words: translated Audiobook Audio recordings were released to four cassette tapes by the √Ñnglatroll label in 1993 entitled \\"Berts januaribetraktelser\\"., \\"Berts februaribetraktelser\\"., Berts marsbetraktelser och Berts aprilbetraktelser Music and songs The cassette tapes consist of following songs: *Januari: \\"Take the Night\\", \\"Min pung\\", \\"Hej kapten (nu √§r du d√∂d)\\", \\"K√∂rv\\" (\\"K√∂rv\\") *Februari: \\"Mormor √§r religi√∂s\\", \\"Moppe\\", \\"G√•, √Ögren\\", \\"Fan, vilket party\\" *Mars: \\"Du kan dra √•t helvete\\", \\"Snoppm√§tart√§vling\\", \\"Nya grannar\\", \\"Upp o ner\\" *April: \\"Borra bra\\", \\"Alla kan svenska\\", \\"Prao - Prao\\", \\"Boogie-woogie\\" Later adaptions On 22 January Bert writes how Nadja's brothers force him to do a \\"raggare\\" PRYO.

In other words, it is the potential space between the lips and cheeks on one side and the tongue on the other; where the forces between the two are equal. Other synonyms include: zone of equilibrium, zone of minimal conflict, potential denture space and dead space. It is in this zone that the natural dentition lie, and this is where artificial teeth of complete dentures should be positioned. Complete dentures that are constructed in this way exhibit enhanced stability, retention and comfort. The neutral zone is an important concept in prosthodontics, because prosthetic teeth generally must conform to the horizontal position determined by the neutral zone. Prostheses which set teeth outside this zone risk problems such as discomfort, cheek or tongue biting, and instability of the denture. The neutral zone is also important in orthodontics. Moving teeth outside of this zone means that the muscular forces on the teeth will be out of balance in one direction, and tend to be more likely to relapse to their original position.  Indications  The neutral zone technique is indicated in cases where there has been: * Extensively resorbed mandibular ridge (minimal bone available to support a denture) * Patients with neurological conditions * Patients who have previously had partial glossectomies, mandibular resection and/or motor nerve damage to the tongue * Where dental implants are not feasible  Advantages and Disadvantages  Advantages of constructing a denture within the neutral zone include: * Improved stability and retention of complete dentures (particularly lower complete dentures) * Correct positioning of posterior artificial teeth allows for sufficient tongue space * Reduced food trapping * Improved aesthetics due to facial support Disadvantages include: * Increased clinical time * Increased laboratory costs References Category:Dentistry ","title":"Neutral zone (dentistry)"},{"id":"40974466","text":"Aliabad (, also Romanized as ‚ÄòAlƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Larim Rural District, Gil Khuran District, Juybar County, Mazandaran Province, Iran.

The school is located in the Landport area of Portsmouth in the English county of Hampshire. History St Luke's School was first established in 1865 as a sunday school for boys. It began to offer more general secondary education for boys and girls in 1922. During World War II, pupils attending the school were largely evacuated to the Isle of Wight, however the school remained open for the remaining students. The school buildings suffered from extensive bomb damage during the war, and new buildings were constructed during the 1960s. This allowed for a significant expansion in the schools capacity. St Luke's went through a period of decline during the 1990s and 2000s, with pupils continuously achieving some of the poorest results in the UK. The school was put into special measures by Ofsted, and the school was threatened with closure. St Luke's was reopened as Charter Academy in September 2009, becoming one of the first schools to become an academy. The school brought in a head teacher with experience of tackling poor achievement and behaviour in London schools. They also recruited a team of ex Royal Navy sailors as pastoral support to provide discipline. Results at the school have significantly improved from being to in the bottom 3% of schools nationally with no pupils achieve 5 A*-Cs to 68% of its pupils now achieving those grades placing it above the national average and making it one of the top three schools in the city.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-children- used-to-throw-chairs-at-people-out-of-the-window-how-a-failing-school-was- turned-round-9039183.html The school was later rebranded Ark Charter Academy The school today Ark Charter Academy is sponsored by Ark and the Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth.

Art career In the 1980s, he started out with a Nikon F-Type camera documenting his surrounding environments as a rebellious yet determined photography student. He subsequently worked as a photographer for definitive style bibles and cultural trailblazing magazines such as Sleazenation and The Face. Pursuing his passion for creating a visual narrative, Lazarides delved deep into British sub- cultures and portrayed the youth of his generation partaking in underground movements such as the UK Rave scene in the early 90s; skate culture and the rise of outsider street art. Commissioned by chance to photograph Banksy‚Äôs portrait in 1997, he continued to work with the artist in many capacities, including as the anonymous artist‚Äôs driver and photographer, before eventually becoming his gallerist. Lazarides and Banksy also launched the 'Pictures on Walls' website in 2001 to promote graffiti art, and widened their scope to work with a larger roster of street artists. He continued this tradition by creating an in-house print studio, Lazarides Editions, and working closely with the artists to create high quality prints to share with the Art community. The market in street art took off in 2007 only shortly before the 2008 Recession, with Banksy's work, \\"Laugh Now\\", selling for ¬£228,000 at auction in early 2008. According to the Financial Times, \\"If there had been one individual responsible for whipping up and sustaining the fever around urban art, and who stood to lose most from its demise, it was Steve Lazarides.\\" Lazarides opened up his first gallery in London in 2006, and brought many unknown artist‚Äôs in the UK to light including holding Invader‚Äôs first UK exhibition, Space Invader‚Äôs Invasion London and Rubik Bad Men II. Lazarides now represents artists including the renowned portrait painter Jonathan Yeo, the Parisian artist JR, the contemporary English painter Antony Micallef and Portuguese graffiti/street artist Vhils. In 2009 he moved headquarters from Charing Cross Road into a five-story Georgian townhouse on Rathbone Place, near Oxford Street, with the first exhibition at the new Lazarides Rathbone being of the Portuguese graffiti artist Vhils, this was also the artists debut UK show. Lazarides Rathbone now forms the flagship Lazarides space with Lazarides Editions creating prints in a separate site (situated in Greenwich). In 2016 Lazarides opened Banksy Print Gallery in South bank‚Äôs Mondrian Hotel, the space centers around Steve‚Äôs time with Banksy and also offers the chance to buy secondary-market Banksy prints. Post- Banksy Lazarides and Banksy parted ways in 2008 in unexplained circumstances. Lazarides began to broaden his scope to organise shows of art that \\"would not look out of place on a Turner Prize shortlist\\". In recent years Lazarides has organised several ambitious 'pop-up' shows, including Hell's Half Acre in October 2010, held in The Old Vic Tunnels beneath Waterloo station, London. He returned to the tunnels in 2011 and 2012, with shows titled Minotaur and Bedlam. The most recent Lazarides off-site venture was in collaboration with The Vinyl Factory in October 2013, titled BRUTAL and taking place at London's 180 The Strand. These pop-up shows have included work by, among others, Doug Foster, Conor Harrington, Lucy McLauchlan, Antony Micallef, Karim Zeriahen, Stanley Donwood, Vhils, Todd James and Ian Francis. In 2016, Lazarides began exploring his personal photography archive and has spent the last four years carefully sifting through a collection of 100,000 images containing roughly 12,000 photographs he took whilst documenting the birth of a legend. The result is a candid photographic overview of the 11 years Lazarides spent as agent, photographer and right-hand man to one of today‚Äôs most famous artist in the form of the books, Banksy Captured Volume I & Volume II. In his true subversive style, Lazarides self-published and self- distributed the first and second editions of Banksy Captured, resulting in sales of over 25,000 copies within a month, at the end of 2019.

It tells the story of Bert Ljung from 1 May to 31 August during the calendar year he turns 13. The book uses the 1989 almanac following the Gregorian Calendar. As standard, Bert opens the chapters with the words \\"Hej hej hall√• dagboken!\\" and finishes with \\"Tack och hej ‚Äì leverpastej\\". Bert writes diary for each day during this calendar year, and most notes depicts what happened yesterday. Originally, the Berts betraktelser trilogy appeared in the radio program Almanackan during 1989, where one program was done each day during one year, which S√∂ren thought was fitting well for a diary. The stories were supposed to be more daring than before, but criticism was low. Book cover The book cover depicts Bert, running around in his untidy room wearing only underpants, and holding his diary in his hands. In the room are also naked male angels, and clouds. One of the angels wears a cap, and uses bow and arrow, hitting the diary. The other angel plays the violin, and the music streams into Bert's ear and out comes the words \\"love\\", while three heart symbols appear above Bert's head. At Bert's writing desk is a gramophone record, and a photograph of Paulina. Next to the wall is Bert's half-broken electric bass. On the floor are Phantom comic books, and two eyes watch out of a rat hole. Plot After Bert and √Öke have been jumping next to the fire during Walpurgis Night, the Heman Hunters demonstrate on May Day, but are removed after singing \\"Tupp fick kramp uti magen, sista skiten kom d√§r\\" (\\"rooster got cramp out in its stomach, the last shit came there\\") to the Internationale tune. On the night between 5 and 6 May, a fire occurs in Bert's hometown, destroying the potato warehouse \\" Arnes potatislager \\". The local police suspects arson, and Bert suspects J√∂rgen Karlsson. Bert also visits his mother's sister Lena's dance institution. Paulina attends dancing courses there, and Bert accidentally drops Paulina into the floor, feeling like he is Adolf Hitler's twin brother. Bert's school class also visited by the 6th graders from √ñstbergaskolan, as the classes will merge before the 7th grade, and Lill-Erik fears them being communists when their teacher calls them \\"comrades\\". By late May, the 6th graders go to a school camp, after colleting money, and as Bert walks alone in the evening Paulina appears, and together they walk to a former open air dance platform, where a romance between them takes place. During the 6th grade commencement at school, √Öke launches his own firework in the school desk. The bench cover catches fire, and the schoolhouse is abandoned. On his way home, Bert meets Paulina, who wants to meet him during summer, and they soon go bathing together. √Öke's father has met a new woman, Hillevi who has Norwegian relatives, and Bert goes sailing with his father and a person called Christer, but turns seasick. For Paulina's name day on 22 June Bert crochets a cloth, and as his caveman persona \\"Milton \\" he goes out and attaches the cloth to a stone, which he throws into Paulina's window. However, it falls into the wrong apartment, requiring Paulina's neighbour to hand over the present. Following tradition, Bert and his relatives spend Midsummer in Babbsand, inside a cottage located on an island. Bert's 18 years old cousin Sandra is bathing naked, and Bert notices his father watching it using binoculars, blaming it on ornithology. When Bert comes home, he finds a letter under the hallway carpet, where Paulina has written a letter telling him to come to Lilla Bryggan during Midsummer Day (when he was Gone). In July Bert's father's brother Janne, who lives in an apartment in New York City in the United States, has invited Bert's family to a holiday in Jamaica. But first, they must travel over to New York City, and the journey is done by aeroplane. When Bert hears of communists not being allowed into the USA, he turns afraid when he knows his neighbour Olle Collin votes for VPK. The problems turn worse when Paulina's cousin Pavel from Czechoslovakia, a USSR ally state, is visiting Sweden. Because of poor USA-USSR relations, Bert fears the USA sending agents into Sweden and he also fears the USA agents seeing Bert with Paulina and Pavel would risk Bert's entry permit to the USA. Bert thinks he sees USA agents inside a parked Televerket bus. Bert now must shows his support for the USA, and calls the embassy of the USA in Sweden, singing \\"Happy Birthday to USA\\", but the staff takes it for Russian folk songs. Bert bring the flag of the USA to McDonald's, when a cigar-smoking man walks by, and the flag catches fire. The local newspaper depicts the event as a youth communist demonstrating outside McDonald's by desecrating and burning the flag of the USA. The trip finally occurs, but when the Heman Hunters meet, √Öke gives Bert a Swedish-Icelandic phrasebook, as √Öke means most aeroplanes on their way to the USA have to emergency land in Iceland. When the Ljung family reaches the USA, Bert's father wants waitstaff to fill the glass to the brim (Swedish: \\"br√§dd\\", may sound like the English word \\"bread\\") when they eat at a restaurant, and when he says \\"Fill it up to the bread\\", waitstaff gives him a bread-piece in the glass. They also visit the Empire State Building. Then, they visit Jamaica, and during the home trip a drunk man from Finland is almost thrown off the aeroplane in Iceland. When Bert comes home, he receives postcards from √Öke, who visits Norway and when they pick up their car at Bert's grandmother, Bert's father forgets that Sweden drives to the right side of the road since 1967, sending two moped riders into the ditches. √Öke returns from Norway, meaning that a civil war between striped and checked people is racing. In late July, Bert and √Öke sleep overnight inside a ghost house. In August, Bert spends a lot of time with his friends, before the 7th grade starts, including taking apples from foreign gardens. When bathing naked in the N√∂ckeln lake, Bert notices Louise being naked. Naked, he and Paulina hug each other. Bert also visits church secretly, asking God for forgiveness for thinking so much of girls. When Bert begins the 7th grade, his class is merged with another one from √ñsterbergsskolan. Bert gets a locker next to D√∂dgr√§varn, who fills his locker with snuffboxes, throwing away books taking too much place, Lill-Erik's locker ends up in the 9th graders corridor, and he writes a letter to the headmaster to continue the 6th grade for another year. Bert's class gets Banan-Boris as chemistry teacher. Banan-Boris takes up a water hose, spraying water at the class. In mathematics Agneta is their teacher, and √Öke protests against home work, for \\"student democracy\\" and against \\"fascism\\", while Jaana throws the mathematics book out of the window. √Öke is sent out of the classroom, and proposes occupation for the teachers' staffroom. During a floorball game during PE, J√∂rgen Karlsson and D√∂dgr√§varn in class 7 B start fighting, and after one week Bj√∂rna comes home to Bert, telling he likes Annica, and that Lena in class 7 C has \\"done it\\". Bj√∂rna also tells he has experienced a lot, but Bert realizes Bj√∂rna \\"lies too bad\\" to become a politician. Bert also gets a visit from Nadja, when he feels down. She gives him a warming hug, but Bert soon falls in love with an 8th grade girl called Ida, but Bert dislikes her being a smoker. The book ends with Bert doing his homework, and his mother says time has run so fast since his parents came home with him from the birthing center, and she wants to kiss him. Burt quickly runs into his neighbor Olle Collin to play the guitar. Later adaptations *The school camp scenes also appear in the TV series episode \\"Fina, fina Paulina\\", expanded into a story where Lill-Erik is left behind by the bus after a break, and stumbles upon a runaway elephant out in the forest. *Bert's 7th grade start also appears in the TV series episode \\"Ett l√•ngt och lyckligt liv\\", but in that adaption, D√∂dgr√§varn is two years older than Bert. Trivia *A coloured version of the image on page 96, where Bert goes behind Paulina at the N√∂ckeln lake beach, works as cover for the June cassette tape recording.Bert *Depicted as an Eastern state in the story, Czechoslovakia was still under communist rule during the mid 1989 radio broadcasting. The book version came out in 1990, after the Velvet Revolution. *By the time of the release of the stories, it had not yet been revealed that the Bert books are set in √ñreskoga, but when the Ljung family visits Jamaica, Bert asks his father how √ñSK plays at Allsvenskan. Audiobook Audio recordings were released to four cassette tapes by the √Ñnglatroll label in 1993 entitled \\"Berts majbetraktelser\\"., \\"Berts junibetraktelser\\"., Berts julibetraktelser och Berts augustibetraktelser Music and songs The cassette tapes consist of following songs: *Maj: \\"Morgonfjong\\" (Multiman), \\"Heaven and Panncake\\", \\"Lill-Eriks hambo\\" (\\"Skalbagge hambo\\"), \\"Fina Paulina\\" (\\"Kom konkurrens\\") *Juni: \\"Blekfet\\", \\"Samma sol, samma sommar\\", \\"Sailing\\" (same lyrics as the Sutherland Brothers's version, but the song's original love-based theme replaced with seasickness), \\"Min far gillar snusk\\" *Juli: \\"Ajm a Goood at Linglish\\", \\"Fill it up to the Bread\\", \\"Jamaica Man\\", \\"Hem√•t igen\\" *Augusti: \\"Sl√• mig\\", \\"Alla pallar\\", \\"Vilde Bill\\", \\"B√∂rja sjuan\\" (\\"Min bil\\") Title within bracket refers to song title at the time of Hemliga Byr√•n's original recording.

The book uses the 1989 almanac following the Gregorian Calendar. As standard, Bert opens the chapters with the words \\"Hej hej hall√• dagboken!\\" and finishes with \\"Tack och hej ‚Äì leverpastej\\". Bert writes diary for each day during this calendar year, and most notes depicts what happened yesterday. Originally, the Berts betraktelser trilogy appeared in the radio program Almanackan during 1989, where one program was done each day during one year, which S√∂ren thought was fitting well for a diary. During October 1989 Anders and S√∂ren \\"sprinted\\" writing the final stories. When reaching the autumn stories, the writers tried to split up the storywriting, calling it \\"creative competition\\", trying to exceed each other with fun and surprise with something unexpected. When the book was released in 1991, it was one of several books by the same writers. 1991 became both the writers' and the book publishing company's best year, saleswise, and the same year the Advent calendar Sunes jul was a TV success. Anders Jacbosson stated in the year 2000 that the book was his favourite Bert book. According to S√∂ren Olsson it shared the first- place together with Berts bokslut. Book cover The book cover shows Bert lying on his littered floor writing in his diary while eating popcorn, and listen to radio-tape recorder at high volume. On the floor is a cassette tape, leverpastej, stockings and cards with girls (Ida, Nadja, Paulina and Emilia). A heart symbol appears out of Bert's head, when he watches a photograph (turned to the other side, not revealing who the picture shows). A lamp lights up in the dark, and a dog-shaped telephone is ringing. Plot The autumn term of the 7th grade at school has begun. It is September, and Bert's grandmother wants Bert to join the Church of Sweden scouts, as she has found Bert's \\"weak point\\": girls. A fire erupts in Lill-Erik's locker at Beckaskolan. As only 7th grader, his locker is in the 9th graders corridor, and now he has to carry the school books in a shopping bag. √Öke gathers a group trying to investigate the event. Bert, however, suspects D√∂dgr√§varn, as he also suspects him being together with Paulina, seeing them visiting a cinema together. Bert notices watches in D√∂dgr√§varn's locker, and he watches D√∂dgr√§varn and Paulina. Bert begins to see Paulina as a \\"traitor\\", and hopes she gets snuff in her mouth when kissing D√∂dgr√§varn, who uses snuff. In this version, D√∂dgr√§varn is in Bert's parallel class 7 B, and not a 9th grader as in the TV series. It is said that D√∂dgr√§varn broke into a candy store as a 9 years old, and since then it has only become worse. A week in September, it is revealed that Lill-Erik caused the fire. Fearing several 9th graders, he hoped to get a locker in the 7th graders' corridor. Some days later, he gets a locker in the 8th graders' corridor. Bert's interest in Paulina declines by mid-September, in favour of Ida, even if he dislikes Ida smoking. Ida shares locker with Lill-Erik, and even Ida's friend Mona smokes. Mona teases Bert for having glasses. Bert finds a notice at his locker, telling Bert is cute despite having glasses, and invites him to come to the bicycle parking one night. Not knowing who writes the letter, Bert never appears. By September Bert also depicts the schoolteachers, and ends up in a fight with J√∂rgen Karlsson in class 7 B at school, as J√∂rgen calls Bert f√∂r \\"fart\\" (Swedish: \\"fj√§rt\\", rhymes with Bert) and \\"flyswatter\\" as Bert states he has never wounded a single fly. During the music lesson at school, √Öke takes the guitar from the music teacher \\"Peruken\\" and sings \\"‚ÄìDen spanska r√§ven rev en annan r√∂v\\". (\\"‚ÄìThe Spanish fox tore another ass\\".) √Öke also expresses Communist opinions. Bert and √Öke also hear that in the USA and the USSR, mystic sounds from space have been reported, which might be extraterrestrials. Early October begins with Bert thinking less on girls, and more on hanging with the other guys. With problems to decide which girl to like, the starts to hang with the other guys in town on Friday and Saturday evening, endin in trouble with raggare. Bert also longs for moped. √Öke tries to play the violin in the Heman Hunters, borrowing a violin from a music store. When the sound is bad, √Öke attaches wires to the violin, which catches fire. Torleif tells √Öke to migrate to Hungary, where the violin is often played. Some 9th graders, among them D√∂dgr√§van's friend Karri, are forced to change school after forcing Inez, a girl in class 7 D, into the Beckaskolan basement to show herself naked. The police arrive, taking the 9th graders away from school. Some days earlier, D√∂dgr√§van has eaten a dinner with Bert at Bert's home. At school, √Öke is often sent into the headmaster (a recurring theme throughout the book). Bert also goes to a cinema with his former girlfriend Nadja, but Bert is not let in, which Nadja is. Bert remains in the foyer, and after hugging, they both go home. In Bj√∂rna's recreation room, Bert, √Öke and Lill-Erik are to meet three \\"hot\\" girls who Bj√∂rna knows, but the date is cancelled when the girl learns Bert will attend. When Bert calls Nadja, her raggare brothers answer that she is at Paulina and his boyfriend. By October, Paulina has a boyfriend with a doodlebug tractor. Friday, 27 October. After another fight at school between D√∂dgr√§varn and J√∂rgen Karlsson, class 7 B has to skip PE and discuss the fighting. Instead, but guys and girls of Bert's class, 7 A, have PE together. During the PE lesson, Bert falls in love with Emilia, a girl in his class who has been there since the 1st grade, but always been in the \\"background\\", and who Bert has rarely cared for (except when they were playing table tennis in the third grade, and Bert said sorry for accidentally smashing the ball knocking her dental braces out). Emilia stares at Bert during the PE lesson, and Bert feels like a new person runs around the gymnastics hall, and het hinks of go to Emilia and present himse, but feels it would be stupid as they've been classmates for six and a half years. Bert also meets Joel, a Christian youth leader riding a motorcycle. Inside a parish hall a group of young people play table tennis. Among them are Emilia, but Bert declines the invitation for swearing when failing to serve the ball. By November, Bert and Emilia often talk. When Bert returns to school after one week of fever, the guys in Bert's class discover Lisa using a bra, and when Bj√∂rna calls for the bra being thrown, he is forced to talk to the counselor. During a school canteen food fight, Lill-Erik (\\"Little Erik\\") is hit with food by Bj√∂rna, and becomes \\"Stor-Erik\\" (\\"Erik the Great\\") and hits Bj√∂rna, before Ida kisses him on his cheek and he becomes Lill-Erik again. Emilia, who never had been sent ouf from a lesson or being forced to attend detention before, is sent out from an English lesson by the schoolteacher, Sven \\"Brallan\\" Bolund, after declaring for Bert where the schoolteacher tells. Bert feels guilty, and depicts the incident as bigger than a war being fought somewhere in the world, where over 400 people are suspected to have been killed. As weeks pass, December comes, with Advent, Saint Lucy's Day, Christmas and New Year. While the class celebrates the First of Advent, Bert watches Emilia in the candlelight, while √Öke puts fire on his mathematics book protesting against his views on Christmas being \\"fascist hypocrisy\\", and he's forced to pay for a new one. √Öke soon says that the Earth is threatened by the \\"multiastronomiska fulingarna\\", extraterrestrials from the \\"inner galaxies\\" in the middle of the Universe, and they say \\"‚ÄìJolijapa\\", which he says is either a greeting, or a death threat, and √Öke plans making a bomb, stealing chemicals from chemistry at school. Bert continues his contacts with Emilia, at school, at the youth club, and in town where her mother thinks Bert is nice, and greets through her daughter. When Bert's class selects a girl acting as Saint Lucy, blond-haired Annika wins 29 votes against 1 for not so blond-haired Emilia, who receives a vote from Bert. Bert's class also sings for their schoolteacher, but √Öke eats up all 31 saffron buns and everyone toses snowballs on him. During the 9th graders Saint Lucy possession, Miranda acts Saint Lucy, and the 7th graders whisper \\"‚ÄìTant Miranda\\" (\\"‚ÄìLady Miranda\\"). When the Christmas break begins, Emilia wants to meet Bert during the holidays. Bert's fathers brother, Janne, who lives in New York City in the USA, visits Sweden over the holidays. Janne gives Bert a videocassette recorder for Christmas, while √Öke gives Bert a pet turtle who Bert names Ove. Between Christmas and New Year, Ove eats Bert's aquarium fishes. Berts old grandmother on his father's side is to tired to arrive, and sends a letter instead. Lill-Erik gets a portable audiocassetteplayer for Christmas, which he thinks is waterproof, which it isn't.

Suddenly he fears the Earth being invaded by small green extraterrestrials from another planet, who would force him to marry a girl of their species instead. New Year celebrations in Bert's family occur with his 18 years old cousin Sandra, and his mother's sister Lena and her husband Lars-Olov, who works with computers. √Öke's family is also about to have a party, where √Öke's father mimics jazz musician Milfred Cherry. The book ends on 31 December with Bert thinking of calling Emilia and ask a Happy New Year and ask to get together, Probably, he doesn't dare since in the upcoming book Berts bravader, set the following year, Bert and Emilia officially go together by mid-year, after meeting several times before.

Her book American Amnesiac was longlisted for the 2013 National Book Award. Raptosh grew up in Idaho and attended the College of Idaho in Caldwell, Idaho, where she earned her BA in literature and modern languages. She received her MFA in poetry at the University of Michigan,Diane Raptosh  Friday, Nov. 15  Culture  Boise Weekly after which she taught at a variety of institutions before returning to teach at the College of Idaho in 1990. Raptosh has received three fellowships in literature from the Idaho Commission on the Arts and holds the Eyck- Berringer Endowed Chair in English at The College of Idaho. In 2013, the Idaho Commission on the Arts awarded her the position of Writer-in-Residence, the highest literary honor in the state, for 2013-16. She was appointed the first Boise Poet Laureate in honor of the city‚Äôs 2013 sesquicentennial celebration. She has completed literary residencies in such places as the Banff Centre and the Studios of Key West. Currently, Raptosh teaches literature and creative writing and directs the Criminal Justice Studies program at the College, the goal of which is teaching students to facilitate writing workshops in prisons and jails, juvenile detention centers and safe houses throughout southeast Idaho and western Oregon, and introducing students to the study of American prison writing. Raptosh lives in Boise, Idaho, with her family.  Works  Writing in varied forms ranging from prose poetry to sonnets, faux crossword puzzles to the ghazal, Raptosh‚Äôs poems visit and revise sociocultural and aesthetic norms, such that all axes may eventually point toward what one of the poems in American Amnesiac calls \\"the spine of a possible decency.\\" Raptosh's first book of poems, Just West of Now (Guernica), was published in 1992. Her other books of poetry are Labor Songs (Guernica, 1999), Parents from a Different Alphabet (Guernicak, 2008), and American Amnesiac (Etruscan Press, 2013) in 2013. The poems in Just West of Now are concerned with \\"our failures of communication, the limitations and possibilities of speech, the search for a literal and figurative home, the entanglements of love given and received,\\" according to a review by Alice Fulton, who notes further that \\"Raptosh‚Äôs work will please those who don‚Äôt read much poetry as well as those who read little else.\\" Her second collection, Labor Songs, \\"speaks in many voices in order to scrutinize the world from multiple perspectives... to chart a complex geography centered in Idaho but further reaching out towards Michigan, Florida, Alaska, and beyond,\\" according to scholar/poet Sandra M. Gilbert. Raptosh‚Äôs third book, Parents from a Different Alphabet, is a collection of prose poems that reckon with gender constructs as well as the plights and blitheness of the body, individual and collective. This book is dedicated to her late father, whose death helps to shape her third work. American Amnesiac (2013), Raptosh‚Äôs fourth poetry collection, was longlisted for the 2013 National Book Award. The booklength dramatic monologue, alternately considered a novella in verse, takes on such themes as individual identity, corporate personhood, and the U.S. prison system. Also a finalist for the 2013 Housatonic Book Award in Poetry, American Amnesiac was hailed by poet/reviewer Daniela Gioseffi as \\"a magnum opus‚Äîone long poem spoken in the persona of an older man suffering from amnesia. The book constitutes his stream of consciousness as he attempts to piece together who he is and what he‚Äôs experienced in his American life.\\" Poet H.L. Hix writes that \\"American Amnesiac makes a genre of the condition its protagonist suffers: it is a dissociative fugue. What its speaker cannot remember, its reader will not forget.\\" Poet/reviewer Marc Sheehan wrote, \\"In these poems, Rinehart/Doe spends as much time and emotional energy piecing together the world around him as he does trying to reconstruct his past. Culture, Rinehart/Doe discovers, both liberates us from ourselves and imprisons us in its expectations.\\" Her upcoming fifth poetry collection, Human Directional (Etruscan Press 2016), tests and explodes boundaries between self and other, human and animal, individual and world. Within this process, the speakers take up a variety of themes ranging from the vicissitudes of love and identity configurations to animal rights and social justice issues. In so doing, the poems point the way to \\"the space of the thinkable\\"‚Äîpoetry the most obvious means to reconstruct, imaginatively and compassionately, what is. About this work, Craig Morgan Teicher wrote, \\"Nothing is off limits to the whirling speaker of Diane Raptosh‚Äôs Human Directional, because ‚Äòthe space of// the thinkable is so much/ larger‚Äô than any one kind of poem, any form, any tone, can contain. So here are spidery couplets, blocks of off-kilter prose, Q&A; as poetry, new compound words, fractions and factoids, whatever‚Äôs necessary to speak the mind of this ‚Äòevery anyone,‚Äô ‚Äòa human tornado‚Äô whose careening meditations cover everything from Wittgenstein to ‚Äòblue-footed-boobies‚Äô to ‚ÄòGayle next door...‚Äô Raptosh is at heart an old-fashioned lyric poet, endearingly lonesome, hopeful about the prospect of a reader‚Äôs company, generous with her ample wisdom and energy: ‚ÄòI am here,‚Äô she writes, ‚Äòbecause I have this tightness in my throat/ I don‚Äôt want taking over the earth,‚Äô and because ‚ÄòI fall slightly in love with whoever I get to/ stand next to.‚Äô It‚Äôs hard not to feel loved by these poems, and to love them.\\" Raptosh's work has also appeared in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Women‚Äôs Studies Quarterly, Terrain.org, Michigan Quarterly Review and OccuPoetry.

It tells the story of Bert Ljung from 2 January to 1 January during the years he turns 14 and 15, covering the spring term in the 7th grade, the upcoming summer break, and the autumn term in the 8th grade. No specific calendar year almanac is used. As standard, Bert opens the chapters with the words \\"Tjena!\\" and finishes with \\"Tjena, tjena ‚Äì mittbena\\". Bert writes diary for each week during this calendar year, not each day like the previous, but in turn the chapters are longer than in the Bert's betraktelser trilogy. It also aired over the Unga Efter tre radio programme back in the early 1990s. Book cover The book cover shows a grass-piece next to the beach, where Bert is on a blanket, where he has placed a T-shirt with the text \\"Heman Hunters\\", and Emilia lies upon Bert's stomach. From under another blanket, two eyes show up. Further away, a little child runs towards the water with a plastic dinosaur. Two girls are sunbathing topless, while two guys watch. An older man also watches, trying to hide his watching from his wife behind a newspaper. At beachside, a macho guys tries to impress two girls. At waterside, bathing and boating recreation occurs. Sun is shining, and birds are moving in the sky. At the book title text, a bird that has caught a fish is seen. Under a black blanket, two feet appear, probably √Öke who opposes Sunbathing in general. Also on Bert and Emilia's blanket are a bag, and a magazine with the text \\"Brudar\\" (\\"chicks\\") and two breasts. Next to Emilia's left foot are two flippers in the grass, and a frog is seen (√Öke has two water frogs, Hasse and Lasse). Plot The book begins on 2 January with Bert writing in his new diary. Since late October last year, Bert is in love with a girl in the same class at school named Emilia, despite the other guys thinks she is a \\"wimp\\" because of good gradeing and school, good behavior and ironed clothes, and Bert knows about the risk. In January, Bert sends Emilia a letter, with the nasty \\"H√∂pp och skit\\" finishing lines. When Bert regrets posting the letter, he tries to pick it up from the letter box, but gets stuck with his arm in the letter box, and gets attacked by two snowball tossing younger children. Bert bribes a bypassing guy with 25 SEK to pick up √Öke, who arrives with plastic explosives, and Bert has to bribe √Öke with 25 SEK to not use the plastic explosive, and instead pick up a hacksaw and saw apart the letter box, and when that attempt fails, Kurre from the petrol station has to assist to break Bert free. Bert re-posts the letter, but once again forgets changing the finishing lines. Bert pounds his head in the letter box, swearing. From a distance, the sound of sirens appear, and Bert realize the local police is about to arrive, to investigate what has happened. Bert runs home. Soon, Bert, √Öke and Lill-Erik travel away by bus to go slalom skiing in the hills, but √Öke rides a pulk and falls out into the mogul skiing slope before ending up at hospital. Emilia asks to come over to Bert and help him with homework (Bert tries to smuggle Emilia into his apartment), about the constitution of Sweden, and thanks Bert for the letter he sent her, which he takes for being a name day letter,Note: The name day for Emilia in Sweden was on 23 January between 1901 and 2000. and how she wrote it for her parents. In March, Bert has a parent-free video evening with √Öke, Lill-Erik, Torleif, Sandra, Camilla, Lisa and Emilia where Lill-Erik is forgotten in Bert's parents' bed, and later during the same month, Bert's school class has a supply teacher in Swedish called Willy, and many girls seem to like him. When Emilia think he's cute, sighs and draws heart on heart symbols on the desk Bert tells Willy that some \\" unruly elements of the class\\" vandalize the desks with doodle. On 2 April, Lill-Erik walks over to Olga in class 5 C and asks to get together, and then tells her it's just an April fool. Olga replies with reminding him such jokes are only allowed on 1 April. During Easter Bert notices his old female friend Paulina in town, and Bj√∂rna throws snuff after her and blames it on Bert. Lill-Erik is not in sight, fearing the Easter Bunny. After the Easter break, Bert notices Emilia accidentally having cut herself in her finger during the break, and walks towards her pat her lightly on her hand and say something kind, when he accidentally gets stuck with his own finger in the bandage, and removes his finger, which brings Emilia's thumb with him, which goes bent backward and swaged. Emilia is required to go with her arm in esmarch bandage for weeks, and words can't describe how much Bert wants to apologize, and instead he just walks away. Soccer season kicks off, and Bert's team has lost the opening games with the results of 0‚Äì12, 1‚Äì9 and 0‚Äì24. √Öke is kicked out of the team by the coach Gordon for throwing a rubber doll into the soccer ground in the third game, instead of playing himself. √Öke soon recruits 9-year-old Charlie, who scores all goals when Bert's team wins the game, 3‚Äì1. On 8 May √Öke celebrates his name day by trying to \\"increase\\" the speed of his bicycle by removing the chain and the breaks, and take off from the central hill before falling right into the watchmaker's display window. When being required to pay a bill, he chops down a flag pole outside the town hall struggling against \\"corruption \\". During Pentecost Eve, Bert meets Emilia at the Domus underwear department, when she invites Bert for a midday over Pentecost Monday (in those day a public holiday in Sweden). Bert believes that when eating at well-educated doctors (which Emilia's parents are), you are suspected to know good behaviour, table manners and eat with and eat with knife and fork while talking financial situation of Sweden and blame it on the trade unions. Bert accepts the invitation, and buys white carnations to Emilia's mother. When arriving, Bert eats with knife and fork, while Emilia's father eats with his fingers. During summer, Bert takes his first summer job, as \\"ice cream guy\\" (Swedish: \\"glassgosse\\") at Bengtssons Caf√©, which Bert first mistakes as \\"glassig gosse\\" (\\"flashy guy\\"), and wears a white tie and buys a cigar which he hears during the job interview, when he learns it's all about an \\"ice cream guy\\", and that he can't smoke. Emilia (who runs the \\"Motionstrampen\\" running event), Lill-Erik and √Öke all appear to buy ice cream. Bert also goes to Denmark with his family. Bert is also out with his \\"gang\\", and officially goes together with Emilia after some summetime romances at the beach (who are also depicted on the book's back cover) and the town park, where Nadja's raggare brothers appear and teases Bert before surprisingly shouts on them to go away. Bert's pet turtle Ove seems to have problems with Emilia, and poops her in her fist. √Öke takes a summer job as a comedian at a factory, but is kicked out after telling jokes about unemployed people on the day after 500 employees had been fired. When the 8th grade starts, Bert's class has family and consumer science, and after behaving bad towards the schoolteacher, Lill-Erik is only allowed theoretical education. By September, Bert and the other guys ride bicycle through town, calling themselves \\"Cykelgalningarna\\" (\\"Bicycle maniacs\\") and depict themselves as a \\"cool gang with rusty handlebars and without retroreflectors\\", who shout \\"‚ÄìHalka-kalka\\". For his 14th birthday, √Öke gets a moped (illegal to drive in Sweden before turning 15). By October Lill-Erik tells he has begun weightlifting, but soon it becomes clear it is not with strong guys in the upper levels of the Swedish primary school, but rather with 3 kilo weights with students from the lower levels of the Swedish primary school. He stops when a guy in the second grade threatens to pull the arm of him. Lill-Erik also gets a girlfriend, 7th grader Hildur who has red hair and glasses, and even if Bert has Emilia, he thinks Hildur is cute. For a while, it seems like Lill-Erik is to move away when his father is offered better wages as a projectionist, but wage negotiations finally fail. Bert's great grandmother Beda on Gotland dies on 14 October, and is buried on Gotland the upcoming week, Bert's family travel over to Gotland and attend the funeral. Bert's band, the Heman Hunters, offers to attend the funeral and play calm rock ballads, but instead a Gotland native blows in a trumpet. By late October, the school nurse takes blood samples from the pupils of Bert's class do, where the guys are screaming to scare each other. Bert does his PRAO at a local newspaper in November. Heman Hunters play at the \\"Hjorten\\" youth club (but √Öke mistakes the name for \\"Lorten\\", Swedish for \\"muck\\"), which Bert depicts in the newspaper, as \\"Treb Gnujl\\" (his own name written backwards). During a school test later during the month, where the students will write their own story, √Öke \\"steals\\" a story from August Strindberg, \\"Fr√§knige Julius\\". Bert writes and about a man watching TV. When he can't come to a good end, he continues the stories nuclear weapon and everyone dies. On 3 December, Bert's school plays an ice hockey tournament. In the opening game, the opponent team is leading, 12‚Äì1, when Lill-Erik is sent to the penalty box twice for hitting an opponent. Bert turns angry on Lill-Erik, and they start to fight before Bert scores seven goals at pure anger, and Bert's school wins, 13‚Äì12. In the second game, Bert is sent to the penalty box for tackling his teammate Lill-Erik, and swearing at the referee. Bert is blamed when his school loses, 0‚Äì8, and is knocked out of the tournament. Later in December, Bert sends Emilia a poetry book, with love poems and blank pages where own poems can be written. Bert regrets writing: \\"Snoppen sitter p√• kroppen och m√•r toppen\\" (\\"The penis is on the body and feels great\\"). Dressed as Santa Claus elves, Bert, √Öke and Lill- Erik go out caroling an afternoon. √Öke has stolen a Red Cross collection box in November, and tricks people that the money are aimed at \\"charity\\", which actually is pieces to √Öke's old, and together they collect 134 SEK and 2 Finnish markka (when Lill-Erik sings Vi √§ro musikanter with Finnish-sounding voice break). On 22 December, the Heman Hunters hold a Christmas party. Torleif announces he will move, playing a funeral tune on his flute, as the entire band cheers. Torleif replies with kicking √Öke out into the snow. All band members run out into the winternight, and the member throws themselves naked into the snow, shouting out loud. A female neighbour is awakened, watches out of the windows and calls the police. When the book ends, it's 1 January of the upcoming calendar year, and Bert tells about last night's New Year's party at Lill-Erik, whose parents aren't at home. Invited are Bert, √Öke and 24 other people (among them Emilia and Torleif). Lill-Erik is worried for objects breaking apart. Bert and Emilia give Lill-Erik an aspirin with rose hip soup before sending him to bed. Bert and Emilia then go to Lill-Erik's mother's sewing room to be alone, when √Öke shows up. Bert and Emilia then go into the basement, when Torleif appears and says he will stay in touch when moving. Both Bert and Emilia want to continue the romance, when √Öke mixes with a sewing cotton causing the electricity to go off, and √Öke forces Bert to assist him holding a candle while √Öke searches the telephone directory, finally finding a half-drunk electrician who fixes the power, and for pay he asks for kisses by the girls. √Öke picks up a wig and kisses the electrician on his hand. The lights return at 00:15, everyone has missed the bells striking twelve, and soon everyone starts leaving. Bert and Emilia walk home together in the New Year's night, and before splitting up for the night they give each other a delayed New Year's resolution, to always stay together for the rest of their lives. After kissing each other goodbye, they both continue walking in different directions, towards their own homes. Continuing home alone, Bert on his way spots a \\"very hot\\" girl at the all-day long-open store \\"Harrys Plejs\\". Bert and the girl look upon each other, and Bert thinks of Emilia and finally comes to realize that probably never used to believe in the \\"nonsense\\" of New Year's resolutions after all.

GPC expanded green parking practices and promoted sustainable urban mobility through its Certified Green Garage rating system. The Certified Green Garage rating system was acquired by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and is administered by the Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI), the certification arm of the USGBC. Rebranded and launched as the Parksmart rating system, Parksmart is now aligned with the full suite of LEED programs under the USGBC organization. Formed in 2009, the GPC comprised over 30 partner organizations including commercial property owners, auto manufacturers, parking operators and technology providers. Among these partner organizations are Brookfield Properties, global engineering firm AECOM, Hines Properties, Standard Parking, Propark America and Osram-Sylvania.  Green Garage Certification  Green Garage Certification integrates 50 discrete technologies, programs and management practices into a transformational lever moving the parking industry to sustainability. Developed, tested and endorsed by building owners & managers, parking operators and manufacturers, like a building-specific LEED, it defines the standard for parking sustainability and the goal for parking owners and operators. As of early 2014, Green Garage Certification is in beta-test at 50+ North American sites; it will formally launch its version 1.0 program on June 1, 2014. The council is the only national body offering sustainability certification to parking facilities. There are 20,000 lots and garages enrolled with the council nationwide ‚Äî covering more than 4.6 million parking spaces.  Demonstrator Sites  GPC Demonstrator Sites were launched in 2009 as precursor to Green Garage Certification to bring recognition and marketability to parking facilities deploying green approaches. Demonstrator Sites are offered to GPC Partners for their own or their client‚Äôs facilities. By 2013, 50 facilities across the North American continent were registered as Demonstrator Sites.  Innovation Salons  The Green Parking Council hosts regional Innovation Salons to \\"address the role of transportation hubs and parking structures as key building blocks for urbanism\\" and to offer \\"fresh thinking...thanks to new technology and creative ideas that can both save...money and reduce carbon footprints.\\"  Lighting Energy Efficiency in Parking Campaign  In collaboration with BOMA, IFMA and the United States Department of Energy, the Green Parking Council launched the LEEP - \\"Lighting Energy Efficiency in Parking\\" - campaign in 2012. The campaign offers education and technical assistance to parking facility owners and operators to accelerate the adoption of energy efficient lighting in parking lots and structures. The United States Department of Energy through its Better Buildings Alliance estimates that high-performance energy efficient lighting in parking facilities can reduce energy costs by 70% and maintenance expenses by 90%.  Acquisition by GBCI  In 2016, the assets of the Green Parking Council were acquired by Green Building Certification Inc (GBCI), the organization independently recognizing excellence in green business industry performance and practice globally, including the U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) LEED certification. The former board of the Green Parking Council became the Sustainable Transportation Advisory Council to GBCI, the Parking Council staff moved over to GBCI and USGBC, and Green Garage Certification was rebranded Parksmart.

Habitat and distribution The species is found from southern Mexico to Brazil, from sea level to an altitude of 1500‚Äì1600 m, and is dominant in several ecosystems such as forests, or economically important cultivated areas. It is diurnal, earth-dwelling and nests in the soil. A study by V√°squez-Ord√≥√±ez et al. (2012) showed that a lower density of E. ruidum nests was found in the woodlands compared to the grasslands. These observations are consistent with those for the departments of Valle del Cauca and Cauca, but not for La Guajira, a drier region in the extreme north of Colombia, where a high abundance of E. ruidum nests was found in areas with higher presence of trees. Parasitism Two species of Kapala (Eucharitidae) have been reported to parasitize this ant in Mexico, and parasitism of E. ruidum by Kapala sp. is also known from Colombia. Kleptoparasitism E. ruidum is reported to engage heavily in kleptoparasitism (thievery) of food from neighbouring nests. To achieve this, specialised workers mimic the cuticular hydrocarbon profile of the target nest.

Praeger pp439 built from stone, wood or both. This floor-plan is typically square or rectangular, but triangular, circular and polygonal layouts are also known. In size they vary considerably with the outer ambulatory ranging from 8.5m to 22m in length and the cella from 5.1m to 16m A central tower building, accessible from a door on one side, was usually roofed, as was the ambulatory, though the tower may rise above the height of the surrounding ambulatory or be pitched so that the two features join together.Lewis, M.J.T. 1966. Temples in Roman Britain (Cambridge Classical Studies). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp174 Some features of the Classical Roman temples are included in the architectural tradition of these temples, such as the addition of columns as part of the exterior wall; ambulatories may remain open or be delineated by a short wall or wall-and- colonnade. The internal features included mosaic floorsLewis, M.J.T. 1966. Temples in Roman Britain (Cambridge Classical Studies). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press pp89 and decorative wall paintings. Structures often, but not without exception, stand within a temenos or sacred enclosure. Religious function Temples, as centres of religious ceremonies and festivals, may have attracted people from surrounding areas.Rodgers, A. 2011. Late Roman Towns in Britain Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp 96-97 Each temple would be dedicated to one or more gods, with a statue in the cella. Votive offerings such as coins, pottery, statues, miniature votive figurines can be found both within the building and in the surrounding ambulatoryWoodward, A. and Leach, P. 1993. \\"The Uley Shrines: Excavation of a Ritual Complex on West Hill, Uley, Gloucestershire: 1977-9\\" (English Heritage Archaeological Report No. 17). London: English Heritage and temenos, suggesting that access may be available throughout the structure and that the external architectural components also serve a purpose within the ritual environment of the temple. The temple at Woodeaton produced evidence for multiple hearths within the temple superstructure, suggesting the use of fire within the religious worship at that site. A priest would perform religious ceremonies within the temple or outside in the enclosure, although the exact daily role they played in Romano- Celtic temples is not well understood. Performing sacrifice, prayers, and overseeing festivals are key features of priesthoods in the Roman Empire. In Aquae Sulis (modern Bath, England), an altar was dedicated by a haruspex;De la Bedoyere, G. 2002. Gods with Thunderbolts: Religion in Roman Britain. Tempus: Stroud. pp 122-125 this religious position may have been utilised elsewhere in Britannia.

Distribution They are, by far, the most frequently occurring type of temple in Roman Britain in place of the Classical Temple which are few in number: the Temple of Claudius in Colchester, the temple of Sulis-Minerva in Bath and the examples at Maryport, Lincoln, Gloucester, and St.Albans are the only known examples.Mattingly, D. 2006. An Imperial Possession: Britain in the Roman Empire. London: Penguin. pp281-281 Romano-Celtic temples occur across Britannia and are frequently associated with sites with recorded pre-Roman activity, such as at Jordan Hill. Temples may be associated with an extra-mural settlement near a fort, as at Vindolanda, or along a roadside. Prominent places within a landscape may also be chosen as sites for Romano-Celtic temples, for example the temple on top of the huge Iron Age Hillfort at Maiden Castle, Dorset or the temple on the coastal promontory at Brean Down, Somerset. The distribution of these temples covers both major and minor towns and includes rural sanctuaries. In towns they can occur as individual temples or in groups of two or more within an enclosure. At least seven have been identified at Camulodunum (Roman Colchester), several of which can be linked to certain deities by the statues and inscriptions found at the sites.Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester - Britain's first Roman town.

Valdes- Rodriguez later wrote a sequel titled Dirty Girls on Top, which was published in 2008. The book is also credited with launching a new movement in Chicano literature and inspiring a series of \\"chick lit\\" novels about Latina women dubbed \\"Chica lit.\\" Plot summary The Dirty Girls Social Club is told in first person narration with the narration switching between six friends who all met in college: Lauren, Usnavys, Rebecca, Sara, Elisabeth and Amber. The friends have different racial and ethnic backgrounds, but find common ground due to their mutual Latina heritage and have nicknamed themselves the sucias (meaning dirty girls in Spanish) as a joke. The novel begins with the women reuniting for one of their regular scheduled meetings. Lauren, who works as a reporter for the Boston Globe, is struggling with an eating disorder and a noncommittal boyfriend but believes that the other women have their lives together. Rebecca, who runs a successful magazine aimed at Latina women called Ella, is struggling in her relationship with her unemployed, white, pseudo- liberal husband, Brad. Sara is hiding the fact that her marriage to her childhood sweetheart Roberto is not what it seems and that he has been growing increasingly erratic and violent. Amber, chasing her dreams of becoming a prominent activist musician, changes her name to Cuicatl. Usnavys grows disenchanted with her boyfriend Juan who cannot afford to shower her with the luxuries she desires.

She expressed disapproval of the adaptation, which was being developed for NBC, for changing the races of several of the characters, and over-sexualizing many characters. The adaptation was later scrapped. In 2013, Valdes-Rodrigues began to raise funds for a movie adaptation of the book through a Kickstarter campaign. Before funding was completed, the project was canceled and moved to Fundly. In 2016, Starz announced a television series based on the novel.

A peculiar situation for the tribal societies of the Union Territory was the fact that in many constituencies members of the same families (even brothers) or clans fought against each other for different parties. There were only two female candidates (Nyari Welly and Omem Deori) standing in the election. Neither was elected. Janata Party won 17 seats, compared to 8 seats for the PPA. 5 seats were won by independents.

It is a sequel to the 2012 film Cowgirls 'n Angels. The film premiered at the 2014 Dallas International Film Festival. Plot Dakota Rose (Haley Ramm) dreams of following in her famous family's footsteps and becoming a champion trick rider. However the shocking news that she was in fact adopted at birth leads her to question both herself and her place in her family's legacy. Cast * Haley Ramm as Dakota Rose * Keith Carradine as Austin Rose * Jade Pettyjohn as Summer Jennings * Emily Bett Rickards as Kristin Rose * Marin Hinkle as Clara * Julie Ann Emery as Annie Cayne * Bryan Dechart as Taylor Chase * Spencer Boldman as Bryce * Leslie-Anne Huff as Madison De La Cruz * Glynn Turman as Isaac Benson * Kimberly Whalen as Dawn Morton Production=Casting In July 2013, it was announced that Spencer Boldman would be starring in the movie, opposite Haley Ramm. Filming The film was originally planned to be filmed in Texas but producer Ben Feingold took the decision to relocate the production to Louisiana just weeks before shooting was due to begin because of tax credit incentives offered by the state. Much of the filming took place in the town of Keachi. Ramm had previous experience horse-riding but was only permitted to perform limited 'horse-tricks', due to concerns that the actress may get hurt. The majority of the horse-riding stunts featured in the film were performed by Texas based all-female trick- riding group 'The Dynamite Dames'. Soundtrack Country artist Amber Hayes recorded a cover version of \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" for the film, produced by Charles Kelley. The singer appears in a cameo role in the film, performing the track. Her original track \\"Home\\" also features on the film's soundtrack. Release The film premiered at the 2014 Dallas International Film Festival.

It was designed by a Swedish architect, Victor Frohling of Thompson & Frohling, of New York and built by both Simons-Mayrant of Charleston and also the Hadden Construction Co. Construction began on December 7, 1909. The pile driving so weakened a nearby residence that the People's Building & Investment Co. had to buy it. The structure is a steel framed building with iron framing whose engineer was D.C. Barbot. Work continued throughout early 1910. The construction of the building became a popular spectacle for residents to watch. An American flag was placed atop the building's frame when it was topped out in late April 1910. The owners of the building considered installing a rooftop garden to take advantage of the superb views from the building. The project was organized by R. Goodwyn Rhett, mayor of Charleston and president of the People's National Bank. He organized a group of 50 local leaders who amassed $150,000 in contributions to the enterprise; Mayor Rhett successfully sought a mortgage of the same amount against the yet unbuilt building from New York backers. The Bank of the State of South Carolina's building at 18 Broad St., Charleston, South Carolina was demolished in 1909 to make way for the new People's Office Building. Many saw it as a sign of progress while others were afraid it would ruin Charleston's skyline. President William Howard Taft, who viewed the city from the top of the building, said, \\"I don't believe that it did ruin the skyline, but if it did the view from up here makes it worth it.\\" When the building opened in April 1911, people came just to ride the steel frame elevators. The first two floors of the building are faced with Winnsboro granite, while the upper floors are faced with buff-colored brick and terra cotta. The eight-story building is constructed of concrete and steel and rated as fireproof. Originally it had, in addition to the banking space, nine rooms on a mezzanine and l3 rooms on each of the upper floors, and the building was steam heated. The People's Bank closed in 1936 and the building was purchased by the Southeastern Securities Co., Charles L. Mullaly, president. Mullaly installed the two white marble leopards at the main entrance. Carved from Italian marble by an unknown 18th-century artist, the leopards were brought to Charleston from an estate near Boston, Mass. In 1990, a plan was approved by the Board of Architectural Review which would have replaced the leopards with gas lamps, but the plan was not executed. The leopards were removed for repair in 2003 and reinstalled the following year. In June 2011, the leopard on the right of the entrance was destroyed by vandalism. The remaining statue was moved indoors, and both were reproduced in 2013 by Kevin McLean, an art student at the College of Charleston. Plans to restore the building as high- grade office space foundered in 1990, and potential developers backed away from a possible purchase of the building over fears that the local market could not support the project in the event of a recession. However, portions of the building were later developed as upscale condos. The two-story penthouse became the most expensive residence in Charleston in March 2020 when it sold for $12 million; the previous holder had been the Col. John Ashe House. The building hosted ABC News' Charleston coverage of the August 21, 2017 solar eclipse.

She was born in Winchester on 12 December 1948 into a prominent Hampshire family. Her grandmother, Sybil Tufnell, was the first woman in the UK to run a firm of estate agents, and her father was a naval captain who served in the Far East and Australia. Born with dislocated hips and later suffering childhood asthma, she overcame these disabilities to ride in gymkhanas and then BSJA showjumping. She rode her mother's novice mare, Scorched Earth, to victory in the Goya Stakes at Kempton Park on 6 May 1972, the first ever ladies' flat race held under Jockey Club rules. Neither horse nor jockey had raced previously. The race was the first in a twelve race series for female jockeys, and with three winners from seven rides, Tufnell was the series champion. She continued to ride competitively until 1974, including in the first mixed race, at Nottingham, in March 1974, and founded the Lady Jockeys' Association of Great Britain, the first such body in the world, after a meeting at Haydock. She was appointed MBE in 1976, a year after retiring from race riding. She opened an equestrian yard and became an instructor, and later went on to train point-to-pointers and hunter chasers with her husband, trainer Glenn Humphrey,whom she married in 1983. The couple separated in 1994. In 2002, she died of cancer at the age of 53 having raised several thousand pounds for Sparks, a children's cancer charity.

It features in the 2012 book 101 Best Australian Beaches by Andy Short and Brad Farmer. Location and access Lipson Cove lies 215 km west-northwest of Adelaide and 63 km northeast of Port Lincoln. The nearest townships are Lipson, inland to the southwest and Port Neill to the north east. It can be accessed from the Lincoln Highway via the Lipson Cove Road. The road is unsealed, but well maintained and always passable for 2-wheel drive vehicles. Basic camping facilities are present behind the dunes near the foreshore. History and development Lipson Cove was named in 1840 by Governor George Gawler after Thomas Lipson R.N., who was South Australia's first harbor master and collector of customs. A privately owned timber jetty was built there in 1882 some 330 feet long. It cost ¬£1,116 to construct and was extended in 1905. In its early days, it was used to ship wool from Warratta Station. A shearing shed stood near the jetty where the excavations of an underground tank remain. During its working life, the jetty enabled trade in wool, wheat and other goods. In 1931 it was announced that the Harbors Board could no longer justify repairing the jetty. Between 1924 and 1936, 14,035 bags of wheat were shipped via the jetty. It was demolished in 1949 and its timbers were sold. Some partial jetty piles remain in place. The cove is renowned for its shore-based fishing and an old talc mine which is located nearby. Coastal features include granite hills and cliffs which extend northwards from Lipson Cove to Port Neill. It is also known for its camping, coastal and marine habitats and is regarded as a safe swimming beach. It has been a popular destination for visitors since the 20th century. Lipson Cove is also the site of the wreck of the ketch, Three Sisters. She was lost on 17 March 1899. The remains of the wooden vessel can sometimes be seen protruding from the beach sand. In 1919, the remains of an indigenous person's body were exposed by shifting sand at Lipson Cove. Some of the bones had shark teeth embedded in them.  Port proposals  The cove is adjacent to the proposed site of a bulk commodities export port known provisionally as Port Spencer. The project site lies immediately to the north of Lipson Cove. It was initially proposed by Centrex Metals Ltd for the export of iron ore, but the company abandoned the project and put the site up for sale. In 2018, agribusiness Free Eyre expressed interest in purchasing the land and developing a grain export port there instead. A revised propopsal was released for public comment in early 2020. The potential environmental impacts of the port proposal have prompted protest from local residents and environmentalists, who are concerned about impacts to Lipson Cove and Lipson Island's recreational and ecological value. Lipson Island Conservation Park Lipson Island lies 150 metres out from the Lipson Cove beach can be accessed when the tide is low, but care must be taken not to become stranded as the tide rises. The island and surrounding intertidal zone constitute the Lipson Island Conservation Park which was proclaimed in 1967 and which is a designated IUCN Category III \\"natural monument.\\" The island is an important rookery for roosting sea birds, including colonies of black-faced cormorant, crested tern and little penguin. The Lipson Island little penguin colony is significant owing to its stable population, while most others of known status in Spencer Gulf are either in decline or have gone extinct. Sooty oystercatchers have also been recorded on the island and New Zealand fur seals visit and haul out there occasionally. Little penguins are known to the area from at least 1954. Lipson Island also bears the alternative French name of Ile d'Alembert, so named by French explorer Nicolas Baudin. Wildlife Species of conservation significance known to inhabit or visit the area include hooded plovers, fairy terns, white- bellied sea eagles, great white sharks, southern right whales and bottlenose dolphins.Atlas of Living Australia \\"Lipson Cove - All Species within 1km radius\\" Retrieved 2013-11-05. Migratory shorebirds known to visit the area include the Sanderling and Sharp-tailed sandpiper. Introduced species observed in the area include the red fox, rock pigeon and European starling. As of July 2020, some 92 different organisms have been identified from Lipson Cove, Lipson Island and the surrounding beaches to the north and south. In addition to those iNaturalist observations, the Atlas of Living Australia shows records of 268 species within a 5km radius of Lipson Cove.

It is one of the largest mental hospitals in Asia. Controversy and criticisms=Bribery by official In December 2004, Times of India reported that a psychiatrist working for Yerwada Mental Hospital had bribed a person associated with the Director General of Police. It was alleged that Govind Vaidya issued fitness certificates for bribes. This was captured by an undercover operation held in July 2000. To stall the investigation, he then bribed an official Rs. 30,000 (500 US$). The raid by the police department into his house resulted in the seizure of Rs. 274,000 (4500 $US). Poor condition and quality of care The quality of care offered by the hospital is poor. The compound has a 100-year-old drainage system and has erratic water supply. This led to some defecating patients to wipe with their clothes. The quality of uniform worn by the patients are also poor. Alleged rape by staff In October 2013, it was reported that a female patient who had been involuntarily committed into the institution was raped by hospital staff. Four individuals were arrested. The director of the hospital refuted the allegations. The patient was taken into care by a non-governmental organization shortly after she filed the complaint. Mental illness among long-term staff  In October 2013, Daily News & Analysis reported that some staff who worked at the hospital for a long period developed mental illness such as schizophrenia and psychosis. These individuals were kept under the care of the hospital psychiatrists. A representative from the hospital also stated that monthly check-ups were being conducted to prevent the occurrence of mental illness among staff members. An independent psychiatrist commented that the demand to show empathy to their patients can result in burnout within a couple of years.

It became a water stop for the San Antonio- San Diego Mail Line in 1857 and a stage station site for the Butterfield Overland Mail Company in 1858. Located 9 miles east of Vallecito stage station and 9 miles west of Carrizo Stage Station, it was a relay or swing station, that provided water and a hostler living there that changed out tired coach teams with 5 horses kept there for the purpose.The 1860 census recorded the Palm Spring station to be manned by the 30-year-old hostler, John White, who cared for five horses and the station stored 12 tons each of barley and hay as feed for the animals. 1860 Federal Census Manuscript Returns, Schedule 4, Agriculture. 1860 Federal Census Manuscript Returns, Schedule 1, Population. San Diego Historical Society Research Archives. Palm Spring Station continued in this role until the Butterfield line shut down in the spring of 1861. It was used by the Union Army for water for its troops and their animals forage on the road to Fort Yuma during the American Civil War. It does not seem to have been revived as a stage station, by later stage lines to Fort Yuma during their time of operation between 1867 and 1877 as most of the other Butterfield stations were, but was still a watering place. During March and April 2001, a surface survey and remote sensing and archaeological investigations including limited shovel test pit explorations were completed. No remains of the stage station were located at the Palm Spring site. At the current time, it is unknown if or where remains of Palm Spring Stage Station still exist.http://www.parks.ca.gov/pages/22491/files/carrizo_creek_historical_and_archaeological_investigations_june_2007.pdf Stephen R.

Though never remarkably successful either at the box office or among critics, Mart√≠n's films, particularly Horror Express, have achieved cult status. The popular horror film magazine Fangoria included Horror Express in its book, 101 Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen: A Celebration of the World's Most Unheralded Fright Flicks. Early Life and First Films Mart√≠n was a child when the Spanish Civil War broke out. Since the uprising first broke out among Nationalist generals in Spanish Africa, the African port city of Ceuta was immediately embroiled in violence. Following the death or arrest of friends and family members, Mart√≠n's family fled to Grenada on the Spanish mainland. After publishing a volume of verse, Mart√≠n's interests veered toward cinema, and while still at university he created Grenada's first film society. Though he considered leaving Francoist Spain for a less censorious environment, he eventually decided to stay in Spain, accepted into the \\"Institute of Cinematic Investigation and Experiences\\" in Madrid. At the institute, Mart√≠n made a series of well-regarded short films and documentaries before making his first feature film Despedida de soltero (\\"Farewell to the Single Life\\"), in 1957. International Collaborations and Commercial Success When European film crews began frequently using Spain as an affordable site for location shooting, Mart√≠n took advantage of opportunities for collaboration and worked with a number of foreign directors, most notably Nicholas Ray. He had the opportunity to direct films using international casts and crew which familiarized him with many different players in 1960s cinema, by many accounts among the most fertile and creative periods in film history.Musicboxfilms.comCBS News In 1966 Mart√≠n directed The Bounty Killer (released as The Ugly Ones in the United States), the first of many Westerns he was to create. It remains among his better known works; dialogue from the film was sampled in the RZA track, \\"Ode to Django,\\" which appeared in the credits of the 2012 Quentin Tarentino film Django Unchained.Indiewire The director maintained that the concept behind his film antedated and influenced the Sergio Leone film For a Few Dollars More, worked on by Duccio Tessari - a mutual acquaintance of Mart√≠n and his friend and former teacher Jos√© G. Maesso. Mart√≠n made several musicals and giallo-type films in the following years, solidifying his reputation as \\"an auteur in every genre\\", per the subtitle of a recent biography. The director's filmography and competence in English led American producer Philip Yordan to contract him for three films, which remain among his better-known works: Bad Man's River, Pancho Villa, and Horror Express. These films have decidedly uneven critical reputations, but the latter especially remains a favorite among fans of its lead actors, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.Rotten Tomatoes Mart√≠n's international profile dropped significantly after his 1973 film, A Candle for the Devil, released in North America as It Happened at Nightmare Inn. After this release, most of his work was in Spanish-language television. On October 11, 2017 he was honored for the fiftieth anniversary of his film El precio de un hombre (1967) at the 7¬∫ Almer√≠a Western Film Festival.

More specifically, it is a complex function of the position in the pupil or aperture (often an iris) that indicates the relative change in amplitude and phase of the light wave. Sometimes this function is referred to as the generalized pupil function, in which case pupil function only indicates whether light is transmitted or not. Imperfections in the optics typically have a direct effect on the pupil function, it is therefore an important tool to study optical imaging systems and their performance.  Relationship with other functions in optics  The complex pupil function \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v) can be written in polar coordinates using two real functions: : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)= \\\\mathrm{A}(u,v)\\\\cdot\\\\mathrm{exp}(i\\\\,\\\\mathrm{\\\\Theta}(u,v)), where \\\\mathrm{\\\\Theta}(u,v) is the phase change (in radians) introduced by the optics, or the surrounding medium. It captures all optical aberrations that occur between the image plane and the focal plane in the scene or sample. The light may also be attenuated differently at different positions (u,v) in the pupil, sometimes deliberately for the purpose of apodization. Such change in amplitude of the light wave is described by the factor \\\\mathrm{A}(u,v). The pupil function is also directly related to the point spread function by its Fourier transform. As such, the effect of aberrations on the point spread function can be described mathematically using the concept of the pupil function. Since the (incoherent) point spread function is also related to the optical transfer function via a Fourier transform, a direct relationship exists between the pupil function and the optical transfer function. In the case of an incoherent optical imaging system, the optical transfer function is the auto correlation of the pupil function.  Examples = In focus  In a homogeneous medium, a point source emits light with spherical wave fronts. A lens that is focused onto the point source will have optics that change the spherical wave front into a planar wave before it passes through the pupil or aperture stop. Often, additional lens element refocus the light onto a sensor or photographic film, by converting the planar wave front to a spherical wave front, centered onto the image plane. The pupil function of such an ideal system is equal to one at every point within the pupil, and zero out with it. In case of a circular pupil, this can be written mathematically as: : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)=1, \\\\forall u,v : \\\\sqrt{u^2+v^2}\\\\leq R : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)=0, \\\\forall u,v : \\\\sqrt{u^2+v^2}>R, where R is the pupil radius.  Out of focus  When the point source is out of focus, the spherical wave will not be completely made planar by the optics, but will have an approximately parabolic wave front: k(u^2+v^2). Such a variation in optical path length corresponds to a radial variation in the complex argument of the pupil function: : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)=\\\\mathrm{exp}(i\\\\,k(u^2+v^2)), \\\\forall u,v : \\\\sqrt{u^2+v^2}\\\\leq R : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)=0, otherwise. It is thus possible to deduce the point- spread function of the out of focus point source as the Fourier transform of the pupil function.  Aberrated Optics  The spherical wave could also be deformed by imperfect optics to an approximately cylindrical wave front: k u^2. : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)=\\\\mathrm{exp}(i\\\\,k u^2), \\\\forall u,v : \\\\sqrt{u^2+v^2}\\\\leq R : \\\\mathrm{P}(u,v)=0, otherwise. Such a variation in optical path length will create an image that is blurred only in one dimension as is typical of systems with astigmatism.

The communication may be influenced by degree of proximity and by non-verbal signals including touch, and varies between different cultures. Research in this field has been carried out on cross-cultural differences, and on interaction in counseling and clinical settings. The field of proxemics Proxemics is one of several subcategories of the study of nonverbal communication. Proxemics can be defined as \\"the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture\\". The term was coined in 1963 by the cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall. In his work on proxemics, Hall separated his theory into two overarching categories: personal space and territory. Personal space describes the immediate space surrounding a person, while territory refers to the area which a person may \\"lay claim to\\" and defend against others. Dimensions of nonverbal communication According to Xu Lin‚Äôs article on Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies, \\"Cultural factors have a great impact on conversational techniques\\", and there are two basic elements consisted in all conversations: informational and communicative. The informational function deals with passing information to another individual; this is known as the information focused element. Whereas, the communicative function deals with the social principle or aim in the conversation, also known as the element that deals with social relationships and drawing closer to people. Xu Lin studies the different classifications of nonverbal communication brought forth by Edward T. Hall (1959). The different dimensions brought forth by Xu Lin and PrabhuPrabhu include: Intimate, Personal, Social and Public Distances. Common methods One of the primary methods used among Kim, D., Pan, Y., & Park, H. (1998), Merkin, R. S. (2006), Albas, C. (1991) and Graves, J. R., & Robinson, J. D. included Likert-type measures of sampling. Participants would be given surveys, videotaped and observed while receiving responding to oral questions posed by formally dressed interviewers. Each study consisted of a controlled group and an experimental group and would measure each individual in a specific manner in order to bring forth accurate results. Each method included a sampling base of volunteers with cheap compensation such as a two dollar reward or extra credit in the class taking part in the experiment. DiBiase describes touch as differentiating depending on various aspects. All people touch and are touched by others, but there are vast differences in the amount of touching that people do. For example, touching appears to vary by gender, culture, and even age. Although these particular differences in touching behavior are not well understood, historically investigators have thought of touch as expressing control and dominance. Not only does touch vary by culture, but also age and gender. They continue to explain how some researchers have suggested that some cultures, such as Middle Eastern, Latin America and Southern Europe, could be considered high-contact cultures (interact at closer distances and touch more frequently) much more in social conversations than people from non-contact cultures such as the USA and Northern Europe. Research by Graves (1976), and Robinson (1976), suggests that an individual's nonverbal behavior is capable of communicating information about the particular individual's feelings and attitudes, regardless of the culture. However, from his research he concluded that the prominent role was in fact played by nonverbal communication in determining the total meaning of the message, and that the message being conveyed could very well differ depending on the context. Among his findings was that within the client- counselor relationship, the consistency or inconsistency between the counselor's verbal and nonverbal behaviors has been found to be an important determinant of the client's impressions of the counselor as well as of the client's proxemics behavior. Albas (1991) studied the comfortable proxemic distances assumed by Canadian female students. The cultural group and sex was held constant; however, the comfortable distances seemed to vary from situation to situation. Preston (2005) discusses the proxemics in clinical and administrative settings. He came to the conclusion that the proximity of people to one another when they interact and the configuration of work areas send a message that affects people in different ways. One of his main suggestions was to use observation skills in understanding how and why others interact within or outside their own space. He claims that people choose to rely on their imagination to better receive unspoken messages sent by others through their spatial interactions.
